        "text": "For those of you who don't know, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a very freedom-encouraging game. Within the first 30-40 minutes of the game, you're basically let loose upon the world. You could run to the final boss and end the game immediately if you wanted to.\n\nAfter leaving the Great Plateau (The starting tutorial-ish area), the first thing I saw was a massive bridge overlooking an enormous lake. I went out to explore it. Tons of loot, an amazing view, and a big island that seemed so remote, yet so enticing.\n\nAfter finding a raft and sailing my way out to it, I met a Zora (fish girl) named Mei. I thought it was really cool to meet a random NPC this far out into the wilderness. This was the first character in the entire game that I met aside from the mandatory NPC that you meet on the Plateau.\n\nThe game gives you a grand adventure on a scale that dwarfs that of Elder Scrolls and The Witcher. The game world might not be as massive as Witcher 3, but the amount of secrets in every little nook and cranny will have you saying \"Wow what's this?!\" \"Wow what's over there?!\" \"What's that light off in the distance?!\" \"Why are these rocks positioned this way?\". Every little thing that seems remotely out of place is that way for a reason. Climbing mountains, trekking across deserts, enduring the chill of endless snowy wastelands, or just wandering along the coastline, and yet there's so god damn much to do. Today, I'm 300 hours into the game, on my second save file (for the newly released hard mode) and working on 100%ing my save file.\n\nThere's 136 quests in the game, and having found all the shrines, and completed the main questline, I had one side quest left to complete. A Zora guard's wife was missing, washed away in a storm. He mentioned that she may have been washed down as far as Lake Hylia. Immediately, I was overwhelmed with the memory of my first hour or so in the game. Instinctively, I rushed back to Lake Hylia, where sure enough, I found Mei again.\n\nBy absolute chance, the first character in this massive world that I'd come across, just happened to be the main character of the last quest I'd finish. There must be hundreds of NPCs in the game, maybe even close to a thousand. It was like my journey had come full circle. An oddly emotional moment that the game developers certainly had no intention for me to have. Based on the number of quests, the number of NPCs I would have more likely met first, and the fact that Mei is in a rather remote location away from roads or towns, I feel like it's a one in a million chance.",

        "text": "Or, \"How I stopped worrying about dealing damage and enjoyed blocking swords with my face\"\n\nI initially wrote this up for a friend who wanted an \"In Character\" accounting of how my group is playing Princes of the Apocalypse.\n\nI was tired of playing Monks and having my shit rolls not contributing to party success. So I went against character:\n\nMeet Yuri Boulder-Breaker: Lawful Neutral Bounty Hunter that is a follower of the deity The Red Knight. Level 3 Bear Totem Barbarian.\n\nI could give you numbers, but the only two that matter are AC: 17, HP: 35, and Passive Perception: 9\n\n**Journal Entry 1:**\n\n**Yuri Now Has Strange Friends:**\n\n**Stranger Number 1:** Birdman with weird magic (Kenku Rogue-Lock) introduced himself to Yuri. Bird Man talked to Yuri with his mind and asked if he could use Yuri's shoulder as lookout perch. Yuri is easy to sneak up on so he agreed. But asked if Bird Man was willing to pay 3 silver per hour for privilege. Bird Man gave Yuri 10 gold pieces as retainer fee. Yuri likes Bird Man. Bird Man believes in Capitalism as much as Yuri.\n\n**Stranger Number 2:** Cute Devil Girl with BAD sunburn with the other type of weird magic (Tiefling Rogue-Druid). How is it that Cute Devil Girl has hooves is she more sneaky than Yuri? Also, Cute Devil Girl got mad at Yuri when he tried carving Funny Orc Swear Word into boat mast. Yuri thinks he needs to bring up question about level of sun exposure to Cute Devil Girl. She must not know what melanoma can do to health later in life...\n\n**Stranger Number 3:** Little Gnome Guy that growls a lot and hides a lot(Svirfnieblen Ranger Rogue). Yuri doesn't understand why, but he feels he must be polite as possible to Little Gnome Guy. He doesn't smile. At all. Yuri wants to keep eye on him, but finds it very difficult task.\n\n**Stranger Number 4:** Holy Wizard Human Man that likes talking to his owl, reading books, and praying to his god of math(Knowledge Cleric). Yuri hasn't prayed much to red Knight so Holy Wizard Human Man makes Yuri feel inadequate. But he is polite. He tells Yuri things like, \"Hello\", and \"Good Morning\", and \"I would cook that first, you could get salmonella...\". Holy Wizard Human Man seems like nice person. Yuri will be nice back.\n\n\n**Stranger Number 5:** Fire Hair Saiyan Man that sings, tells dirty jokes about mother of Dwarf Kings, and HIS HAIR IS ONE FIRE (Fire Genasi Bard). YURI THINKS THAT IS SO COOL. Anyways, Yuri thinks he will ask Fire Hair Saiyan Man if he can harmonize with Yuri's Harmonica... Uh, Yuri means mouth harp... Uh, Yuri means he wants to ask Fire Hair Saiyan Man if he wants to make beautiful musi.... Yuri doesn't know how to finish sentence without sounding like smitten boy Elf... Where is Cute Devil Girl to help Yuri reinforce socially dictated gender norms when he needs her?\n\n***Session 1: I'm on a boat, motherfucker...***\n\nYuri has job.\n\nYuri has job on boat with lots of strange people. \n\nIt is morning, and Yuri is standing on....(bow?) of River Ship. River Ship is almost as big as river. It doesn't make much sense to Yuri either, just go with it.\n\nSURPRISE SQUID ATTACK\n\nSuddenly, 2 giant squids and ten squishy humans with 12 teeth (Yuri knows, he counted...) attack attack river boat. One of squids climbs onto deck of ship and stares Yuri in the eye.\n\nBig mistake, Mister Squid. Where Yuri comes from, eye contact from strange animals means it's time to **RAGE !**\n\nYuri decides to rage.\n\nYuri pulls out shield and spear like Dwarf teacher from Gauntlegrym told him and stabs Giant Squid several times.\n\nYuri decides this is taking too long. Yuri drops his shield and spear ***PUTS SQUID IN FULL NELSON LIKE DADDY ORC USED TO DO.*** Also, Yuri makes note to talk to mental health professional about root of anger issues.\n\nSquid can't move.\n\nSquid gets fear in his eyes like Halfling at Jenny Craig meeting...\n\n**FUCK YOU SQUID.**\n\nYuri suplexes giant squid at Cute Devil Girl so she can stab with horns.\n\nYuri's aim is perfect.\n\nYuri stabs OTHER giant squid to death then picks up first squid off of Cute Devil Girl.\n\nYuri overestimated strength of Cute Devil Girl.\n\nYuri gets yelled at by Cute Devil Girl. Yuri apoloizes with romantic tentacle bouquet.\n\nYuri gets yelled at again, but Cute Devil Girl smiles while yelling at him. Yuri is in like Kevin Flynn...\n\nYuri remembers he is good cook and makes calamari for Five strangers and two surviving crew members. With help from Cute Devil Girl lighting fireplace.\n\nYuri notices fire started by Cute Devil Girl smells like eggs so he waits a few minutes before he puts Mr. Squids tentacles on Barby.\n\nEdit: And owl. Holy Wizard Human Man's Owl wanted Yuri to include ~~him~~ **HER**, include *HER* at dinner table as well.\n\nBoat makes it to Small Boat Town. Yuri goes to tavern with boat protection money (yay! 50 gold!) and tips Cute Human Waitress Girl 1 gold per mug of Dwarf Holy Water. Yuri tells Cute Human Waitress Girl that green dress would go pretty with her red hair and green eyes. Cute Waitress Girl gives Yuri key to her room.\n\nBirdman tells Yuri with minspeak that capitalism is least effective in Small Boat Towns. Yuri disagrees, citing that Cute Waitress Girl plans on going to Wizard college in Longsaddle with Yuri's tip money. Birdman doesn't retort. \n\nYuri wins argument with flawless argument. Also, Yuri makes mental note to talk to Cute Waitress Girl is licensed psychologist.\n\nYuri also has 20 gold left.\n\nYuri wants fuzzy hat with ear flaps.\n\nTo be continued...",

There was some settings before the game started, but I didn't know what those were back then, turns I out the copy I had was PARADOX cracked. One time when I was playing, I accidentaly selected the Peter Parker skin for the game - trough the Paradox settings - you imagine how excited I was back then :D. I was kind of exploring the map, I think it was the first level. I swinged to a building then all of a sudden a face appeared on it (I think it was Doc-Ock's), then he started talking about something, I didn't speak English back then, but one word I can remember that he said was: future (the speech was kind of echoey), I can't remember it well, but it sure happened. My 10 yr old self was scared shitless from some reason and turned the console off after his face disappeared from the building. It never happened again. Anyone knows what the actual f*ck happened on that map? Is this even in the game? (Well it must be, I don't think my imagination has anything to do with this, I remember it so clearly).\n\nAny thoughts?",

Should I start calling this the adventures of Salad and the side dressings? \nfor this one especially its probably best if you read at least part 8 before anyways!\n\nPart 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5m7ymg/salad_the_necromancer_and_the_paladin_of_the_rcmp/\n\nPart 8:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6ps60e/pathfinder_salad_the_necromancer_and_th_oh_sht_is/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe left our intrepid but somewhat clueless adventures in crisis! two of the party members had become captured by (The) Baba Yaga!!! \n\nSo off we go! hopping aboard Fluffy the necro-dragon and give chase! actually using the chase rules!\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFluffy is only marginally faster than this thing, but it is immune to most of our magics and has some tricks of its own, it belches black smoke full of cinders at us, causing fire damage, Fluffly responds by crashing into it, failing to grab hold but wrecking the chimney, the winds pick up, it hops near a cliff, making it hard to maneuver\nSir Micheal Dive bombs the thing, jumping off of Fluffy's  back and just narrowly manages to catch the side of the roof, pulling himself up, the hut begins to hop more and more erratically (you would too if an 8 ton dragon made of bones and other bits was dive bombing you like an angry crow) until Sir Micheal throws some kinda bomb down its ruined chimney, and Kalden the Inquisitor uses his big F* off gun to shoot the leg out from under the hut, it comes crashing down on its side but in on piece with the front facing us, the door flings open and we the world tastes faintly of purple and we are all pulled inside.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInside the hutt, well inside the rather well appointed mud room, I find fluffy shrunk as if via carry companion (noting that my command word still activated it ok) and being somewhat thankful for that as this small mud room would be an awful lot more crowded with him at full size, so after wiping our feet and making sure we weren't  tracking mud everywhere (This was an actual In game, in character discussion we had) as we may be a motley crew of villains and heroes, we respect the idea of how difficult it is to keep a lair clean.\n\nExiting the mud room into the house proper we find a long path winding through inky nothingness, coming to a central space then splitting to three branches, one going straight forward enters to an ornate corridor that twists and winds, with sounds like a great dining hall, to the left the path makes sharp 90 degree turns upwards and spirals amongst other wacky turns at the end there was a door and we could hear kitchen noises through it, the path to the right appears to begin as a nice corridor then becomes gravelly and muddy and looks as if it winds into the woods... which is strange because ya know... indoors. Being like any good adventurers we immediately choose the left path\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nNow the weird thing about the left path is while it twisted and wound gravity quite firmly kept everyone adhered to the path. we reach the door and enter into a kitchen, bustling and busy, its almost something straight out of a fairy tale- cutlery, prep tools and so on all preparing food, plating it and whisking it away all on their own, not a soul in sight, so we poke around the room, we find the elemental in a barrel, apparently they were using his sandy form to help with the cleaning of the dishes, happy to be free of that we go to leave, untilll....\n\nSir Micheal eats something off one of the plates, everything in the room freezes and turns menacingly towards us.... ROLL INITIATIVE! one of the few times Salad has gotten top of the pile, and he had just the spell, one cone of cold later everything save the big cauldron and a single frying pan are frozen and \"dead\" on the ground. Sir Micheal knocks the pan out and the elemental.... tames the cauldron??? well now he has a sentient cauldron pet- which he is transcribing his (actually really impressive) cooking knowledge on the side of, and the cauldron can display a specific recipe transcribed on it. Which is pretty cool.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCut to the valkyrie, she is alone in a meadow (speaking of her, I have never learned the PC's name and the player refuses to tell me so I can update the story and use their name in the character blurb....)  looking about all is quiet, but there is something unsettling about this meadow....\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe party raids the pantry, Salad specifically taking anything strange and rare (griffin eggs etc.) and the elemental taking the rest.\nwe then leave, returning to the crossroads- the directly ahead road, the ornate one, looks very.... well boss battle ish and we dont have a big key so we decide to go check out the wooded path, eventually coming to an oak door that opens onto.... a meadow!\nrolling  hills and flowers etc as far as the eye can see, we should helloo!? (The valkyrie hears something) we try to move forward but after a few moments we find that we have gone nowhere.... through a comedic montage of trial and error it is determined you have to focus on a specific point or object to go there. we call out HELLOOOO!!?!??!?! using Salad's magic to amplify (some people make saves the Valkyrie CLEARLY heard that!) we shout the instructions on how to move places, we shout Respond if you can hear us, we move around the meadow a bunch and find nothing at all......\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is because as soon as the instructions were shouted the Valkyrie focused really hard on.... finding lunch? and a door appeared! entering the door she exits the meadow into a ruined kitchen, with frozen and dented cookware everywhere, she makes herself a big sandwich and leaves through the main door, winding her way down the path towards the crossroads, after a few minutes, the rest of us having given up on finding her there also return to the crossroads and after a how did you get there? moment we decide to go down the last corridor......\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEntering into an absolutely massive hall containing a huge table with mountains of food on it stretching the length of the hall, stained glass mirror depicting battles both famous and forgotten and a few that have yet to come, we get to the end of the hall, and there is a large man in black armor seated, he bids us sit and enjoy dinner with him, not wanting to be rude we of course accept and enjoy a fantastic meal of any food you could possibly desire. He explains he is the Black Knight, the 3rd rider of Baba Yaga, and while he is the most powerful of the 3 he also has no desire to be beholden to her anymore, you see new riders are picked every 100 years and when that is up the old ones are wiped from existence, he is no Zealot or Psychopath, he merely is an old military man who wishes to be free. He asks our aid in free-ing his body from Baba Yaga's Clutches and in return he will aid us in defeating her\n\nwe debate\n   do we trust him? he could be luring us into a trap or could stab us in the back\nbut if we dont and just kill him what does that make us?\n         If we listen to what he has to say he may be able to show us the source of her power!\n\neventually we accept and he thanks us greatly, and instructs us to return to the meadow, he will mask us from Baba Yaga as long as he can but we dont have too much time, we hurry there, entering back through the oak door....\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe meadow is there before us for a minute but then it all shifts, everything faintly tastes of yellow for a second and the meadow is replaced by a dark and withered forest, few leaves on the trees, blackened bark and darkness. The voice of the black knight comes to us telling us to follow the path, at the end there will be a tree with the bodies of the 3 riders, cut him down and he will be free... we follow the path, stopping at the base of a cliff to rest for the night, in the morning we climb the cliff and continue. Sir Micheal gets an eiree feeling, like something is following us, he keeps seeing black shapes moving in behind the trees all around us, finally he points one shape out to Salad and asks him to blast it with a spell- Salad asks 0-6? he says ummm 3? sure, fireball, boooom! a huge hole blown in the branches etc. and a figure in the now empty space... its a tooth fairy, a dire tooth fairy...  a horde of them begin to encircle us and a firgure comes lumbering down the path.... Sir Micheal begins shouting 6!! hit em with a 6!!! now see we had just levelled up so he didnt know exactly what 6 would mean for me... buuut hey, I still got a paladin to ask for a circle of death.. rolling quite well and wiping out 4 of the 8 tooth fairies, Sir Micheal goes toe to toe with some bizzare form of a flesh golem (a scarecrow) and the rest of the party moves to take down the other tooth fairies. \nthe fight being rather short due to our levelled up prowess we continue on!\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEventually we reach this huge and gnarled tree with three bodies... basically impaled on it, they are immediately recognizable as the 3 riders, but every orifice is filled with a gnarled branch (mouth, nose, ears, bellybutton, you name it)  We have a lengthy, and I mean like half hour to 45 minute debate on whether or not to just kill the white and red knights, to cut them down and whether to truly free the black knight.\n\nSalad firmly argue the Red Knight is too dangerous to let live at bare minimum, the Black knight should be helped and the white should be killed too\n      Kalden and Sir Micheal want to make them all stand trail\nThe elemental wants to just burn the whole tree down, the summoner undecided\n\n   In the end we pull the white knight down as a test- He awakes (taking lots of damage from the roots) and begins ranting about the greatness of Baba Yaga and how we are fools and so we kill him. a bit more arguing and salad kills the red knight himself before even cutting him down, cocoons forming in the spaces where the white and read were.... The black knight we more gently free healing him and removing the vines.... He eventually can stand and speak and he thanks us, we need to move very quickly now, he grabs the cocoons, and begins a ritual, which Salad watches extremely closely, The elemental burns the tree down from within.\nThe ritual completes and the Black knight absorbs the powers of the other two, becoming a shimmering, shining knight, something new, something free from Baba Yaga's powers......\n\nHe thanks us and says if we are prepared (we are) he will take us to Baba Yaga immediately. The whole world takes like a rainbow and shlooorp, we are in Baba Yaga's bedroom... She is still in bed. She is most displeased with us. We demand she surrenders, She looks at the future through her mortar and pestle..... and surrenders. CUE LENGTHLY DEBATE ON THE TERMS. She agrees to take us to the cult leader who will complete his plan of draining most of the magic from the world in 7 days time, there is no way we will ever find him without her help, in return she wants immunity for her involvement, we agree except she has to do 10 years community service repairing the communities she has damaged, make sure she understand this immunity does not include future crimes and that she restricts her movements to Russia. \nShe agrees\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nShe tells us the Cult leader is named Nikola Tesla (GASP!) he was an inventor who went mad after no one wanted his inventions because magic was easier, he has a machine that will shoot most of the world's magic off into space in 7 days time, we follow her to the balcony, the world blurs as the hut travels faster and faster, She chuckles as we pass a small village decorated with evergreen trees, gumdrops and candy canes \"Old fool still thinks he can hide his town from me\" \n\nEventually we reach a bare, icy plain, nothing in sight but more snow and ice for miles around. She gets the house to dig, opening a pathway to stairs downward... we follow down and down, Baba Yaga leaving to return to Russia as we travel, Untill we come out to a ledge looking out at a vast world that extends beyond the distance the eye can see, a massive cavern, containing lush jungle trees hundreds of feet tall..... welcome... to the lost world of Nikola Tesla!\n ",

Salad's immediate reaction is to grab the nearest pc (Kalden) and teleports us into a nearby tree, where Kalden begins to take pot shots, salad unleashes fluffy and the Paladin and elemental charge the white knight... or knight of the bright day or lightbright as we took to calling him, just as soon as he finished his badguy monologue about how we were impeding progress and how we were nothing but weaklings and he'd destroy us and blah blah blah (Salad didnt interrupt because he appreciates the value and practice of a good bad guy monologue)\n\nHe deals huge damage making it incredibly tough to fight him, Salad projects shadow and begins flinging enervations at him to assist, he nearly anihilates me with a sunbeam type spell in return (if I wasnt incoporeal I would have been dead) his boar gores the stone form of the elemental causing horrific damage, but in return the Paladin smites him with holy vengeance eliminating him in short order. he fades from existence telling us that no matter we will still fall before the strength of the Knight of Red Dawn and the Black Knight.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAfter finding loot and several more destroyed villages the tacks of the boar lightbright was riding change to that of a great bear, we find a place to camp and decide to rest for the night, only to be awoken in the early hours by sounds of alarm and the smell of smoke in the air.\nrushing back to the werewolf village we find it on fire- demons of smoke and flame racing around the trees, burning dwellings and chasing werewolves, the knight of red dawn throwing alchemical bombs everywhere laughing like a maniac. Salad, fluffly, the elemental and the inquistior do their best to put out the flames and fight the demons, while The paladin and Valkyrie move to cut the Red Dawn off from the village- the Valkyrie uses a wall of ice to create a battle arena and they face off, Red dawn rants about how they shall burn the world and us with it and cackles wildly. The fight begins! Paladin smites evil! Red Dawn misses the paladin! the Bear begins to break down the wall, The Paladin procedes to crit at least 2 attacks ina  row, making this a very short fight.... Rather than fading from existence like the bright day Red dawn turns molten and burrows down escaping our reach... for now...\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nwe get all the fires put out and the village somewhat restored, we are rather firmly encouraged to never come back, Maxim tells us of a ruined church a couple day's travel where strange things have happened and we may take shelter.\n  on the first night we camp in a pleasant clearing near a babbling brook we rest, untill salad hears something strange, the brook seems to make noise then stop, make more noise then stop and so on, so he calls out hello in Aquan.... after a tense few minutes of calling out and rousing the party members (and fluffy looking menacing) the water nymphs the paladin and elemental caroused with at the bath house emerge, they share pleasant greetings and tell us a strange hot being broke into their underground waterways some few miles southeast of here, we relay about the red dawn and they imply he will no longer be a threat, they also warn us of going north, Baba Yaga prowls the area and to face her is to risk destruction.... SO OF COURSE WE CONTINUE NORTH! ALL ABOARD THE PLOT TRAIIIN CHOO CHOO!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe reach the abandoned church which from the exterior has a very spooky vibe, I avoid attempting to raid the graveyard because I both got a stern look from the paladin, and assumed it was hallowed ground. we open the doors to the church and are greeted by..... MUSHROOM PEOPLE! who all stare at us and reach their arms out, they are small and non-menacing... moderately adorable really, anyways Kalden (inquisitor) reaches his arms out and they get him to follow them to the former priests quarters, wherein they open a trapdoor! and gesture down it, so of course Kalden wanders down do a large cave riddles with holes big enough to crawl through, and in the center, starting to move is a massive (huge) centipede..... SO HE LEGS IT! coming literally screaming back up the Ladder and into the main hall, but unfortunately he does not reach freedom before the creature grabs him before he can escape. doing heavy damage gouging a hole in his side. this time Salad springs into action, touching both the inquisitor and the creature, and casting shadowwalk- bringing us to the edge of the plane of shadow- confused the creature releases him and reels back- to which Salad, still touching Kalden but not the creature cancels the shadowwalk leaving it trapped (kinda, 50/50 it wanders into the material plane or plane of shadow a long way away) and us safe for now..... its now midday and we suspect the last knight, the middle of the Knight will attack us so we prepare, we enlist the mushroom people to sturdy up the church, we make sure the holes are all plugged in the caven below, fluffly stays inside the church via carry companion.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ntowards the middle of the night we begin to hear rustling, and thumping outside in the forest- salad hides and uses project shadow to poke his head outside, he sees a massive chicken legged- well one legged- hut hop out of the woods and come to rest at the door of the church, the elemental becomes air and seeps outside, salad returns inside. \n\nThe doors burst open and a wizened crone riding inside a huge mortar and pestle floats in, keeping just outside our reach and begins to berate us for causing trouble and messing with her plans, Salad tries to intimidate/scare her by using illusions and linguistics to speak at her from every direction in all the languages he knows (somewhere around 20) in voices as raspy as the grave, telling her she should not have come. of course she sees right through this (I was super proud of that idea, but alas I should have expected it) and continues to threaten us, while the Inquisitor, Paladin and I talk to Baba Yaga trying to find out what we can about the cult, who's the leader etc. the valkyrie slips out looking for the elemental, who snuck their way into the open door of Baba Yaga's hut- the valkyrie follows suit, yet just walks in. \n\nafter we finish needling her and getting absolutely nothing usefull she departs, entering her hut and having the door slam behind her. it takes off, hopping away, and in moments we realize we are down two party members and take off in hot pursuit! hopping aboard fluffy and flying after the hut!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nso thats part 8, in the next few days I hope to have the next 3 parts up which actually wraps up the main campaign, but there is more ongoing still, let me know if you all like these and if i should continue with the stories after the new arc begins!\n",

        "text": "If I may, I'd like to discuss a story that came about from me going on a tangent with friends before I found out that this year is the 20th anniversary of Armored Core. This is a little tale about a gamer who decided poor controls weren't going to beat them.\n\nWell, that's sort of a lie - the first Armored Core I played had no controls to speak of. It was Formula Front, the one for the PSP that involved AI ACs blasting one another to bits in arena battles. I gave it my best, and then I gave up on trying to make fancy builds centered around a lot of the cool stuff like all the fancy missiles with wacky trajectories, or the energy machine gun, or the hugenormous shoulder-mounted laser cannon, or the - okay, there's just a lot of really badass weapons that didn't work out for one reason or another because I would always be outdrawn and pummeled by builds that could do one job really well: drop down lots of damage in a very short amount of time. Somehow the AI never quite caught on to my brilliant strategies of \"have a generator way too high-spec to justify the single shot offense,\" \"somehow make the Not Quick Boost/Turn/hover boosters not suck,\" \"make the parrying blade's nine kajillion years of windup worth standing dead still in front of an opponent taking all the bullets in Christendom\" and \"find a use for Over Boost that doesn't involve gratuitously draining the generator.\"\n\nSo, I thought like a player: I envisioned a design for this lightweight biped that would bunnyhop and strafe around like Tigger with a gun and a score to settle, and due to the build needing lots and lots of energy for the biggest boosters I could mount, any energy weapons were out. Hell, I don't know what other than some raw offense that energy weapons offer; they're just guns that run down your ammo and energy, not just your ammo like guns and missiles. There are torsos with the Exceed Orbit system that kinda work like the funnels or bits in Mobile Suit Gundam where they also get guns and bullets, too.\n\nThe result was that this multigunner...ended up working way, way better than it had any right to. Getting shot in Armored Core ever since Last Raven raises your Heat levels, and getting too hot starts draining you of energy, and finally, starts doing you damage as you're legit set on fire. As it turns out, getitng pounded by enough ammunition to constitute a Michael Bay film can and will set an opponent on fire, forcing them not to boost, not to shoot energy weapons, and not to do anything that would get them out of the way of the pummeling they receive. Getting hit by the first volley is a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle of getting shot. Even if the AI interprets \"bunnyhop and strafe\" as \"bounce inelegantly right into your opponent's guns like you want hugs,\" there's so much flak filling the air that your opponent will melt like Velveeta, and that's how I beat Armored Core Formula Front.\n\nI tinkered with this until I got a black heavyweight under the Tim Taylor logic of \"well if I'm boosting around I'm not running, so I don't need leg speed, I just need to build up my hit points pool so I can wade right into an opening volley, laugh, then vaporize my opponent.\" The first black gunner was a sledgehammer with machine guns on machine guns, machine guns to back up the machine guns, and an absolutely enviable win record. But all things had to come to an end, so after I won everything there was to win in Formula Front, I needed to test myself against real opposition.\n\nThe first true Armored Core I ever played, as in \"you're actually in the cockpit and have to do all the driving yourself\" was Silent Line, one of the million billion zillion games From Software made on the PS2 under Armored Core 3's general engine. It was under an earlier build, see, before the heat and before the ammunition magazines, which ended up making certain weapons, like my beloved machine guns, a lot more dangerous. Only trouble is, that wasn't my problem.\n\nMy problem was that i was playing Silent Line on the PSP.\n\nSee, Armored Core 3 and its bazillion sequels were made in a time where the PS2 games switched from the original PSX controls to the current twin-stick setup. That's why the left arm weapons used to just be laser blades: there was next to no real way to fire two guns and move at the same time, so you just had one and swung the laser blade at stuff that got too uppity. AC3 undid this restriction by giving you a setup where you can boost, move, aim and fire multiple weapons all at once because you can actually hit all thse buttons at once. The PSP...doesn't. Not even the Vita does. My attempts to make the champion twin gunners that won me Formula Front were all sabotaged by the fact that I wasn't an octopus.\n\nSo I was forced back to basics. I had to assume there were only a bunch of buttons I could hit simultaneously, and that was the thumbstick for forward, backward, and steering, the shoulder buttons for strafing, the boost button for changing elevation and speeding up, and a fire button. Just the one fire button. If I stopped to change guns, I would get shot. If I tried to use an offhand weapon, I would get shot. If I tried to change my look angle up or down too much, I would get shot. The plan would be to strafe and shoot, and do nothing else. It needed iron discipline and one build plan meant more for longevity than all-out offense. Off went the offhand machine gun, on went a solid shield. Away went the energy shoulder shields, on went solid ones. Off went the optional micro-missiles, and one went a backpack that added more ammo for the machine gun, which could fart out bullets in one, long, continuous chain.\n\nAgain, it worked way, way too well for what it was. The Black Gunner was the equivalent of throwing a Zaku II at everything in Silent Line, and it was probably the most efficient killer in that game. Winning fights was about circle-strafing like Doom and making like an A-10 on feet, and hilariously, nothing stood up well to this assault. Not other Ravens with crazier kit, not the big bipedal MTs that made the Silent Line so silent under pain of automatic plasma cannon, not IBIS, the Eva unit-looking Nineball Seraph wannabe, not anybody in the Arena. One chump with black urban camo and a machine gun beat all of them, and that chump was left to not believe that shit.\n\nNext came Last Raven, where the Black Gunner only worked so well. See, this was where it became pretty clear that I didn't have the controls to let me multitask the way I needed to in a game where the difficulty was cranked up and everyone was on their A game. Oh, don't get me wrong, I could send arena fighters screaming back home to their mommies like in Silent Line, but it only lasted so long as it became increasingly clear I was fighting with one foot in a bucket. The Gunners were still not to be trifled with, but it's just that it's not quite as fun knowing you're not exactly playing with all the abilities you can.\n\n...which certainly wasn't the case when Armored Cores 4 and For Answer rolled around.\n\nThere, all I needed to do to keep the Gunners current was put another machine gun back in my off hand and go lighter. Maybe not too light, and not all the time, I did some pretty dickish things like cheesing the blade duel battle in AC4 by nuking the French Next jockey who owned the Moonlight blades with two big grenade cannons, using the claustrophobic nature of her own arena against her, but I made up for it by doing the duel correctly the second time...shredding her with her own swords instead in a proper sword duel.\n\nFor Answer was where I found an opponent I couldn't beat: PS3 optimization. One of the Next jockeys packed a plasma cannon and some kind of launcher thing that were designed to tank framerates, and with all that working against me I wasn't gonna do much. I stepped away, and should really step back in, but...well, the game changed, and I changed. I wasn't ready to go back for V and Verdict Day, and I don't know if I'll be there for 6, if it ever shows up. But for one moment I was a Raven. I was THE Raven. And yeah, every player's THE Raven thanks to the narrative making them out to be the special ones, and outside of that you're just some shmuck with a giant robot, but I tip my hat to anybody who's done more with less. People already probably have, and hey, that's fine, too. Everybody loves a good self-imposed challenge.\n\nTL;DR: Getting pissed off at the PSP Armored Core controls led me to chewing through games as the equivalent of Chirico Cuvie.",

We can call them S and F.\n\nS was playing with Ishmael and N with Mir.\n\nWe were goig to have 1 more player, but he called at the last minute and told that he couldn't come. God Emperor dammit.\n\nAnyway, after the introductory text, the decided to go to the factories on the distance, but I stopped them with Jurtz and Sargeant Raynard, wich follwed to the commisair.\n\nThe conversation with the commisair went pretty good, they asked some questions, and with them never played ttrpgs before, was actually quite good. Albeit they didn't explore the campament. They also got the rope and\n\nAnyway, they now enter the mine. During the travel, N failed a check to pass a chasm and lost 1 wound. At first, they decided to go to point 9, and after F failed the check with a 97, so he ran away to point 7, where 4 mutants attacked him. S needed a turn to come, but F managed to pass the assault without suffering any damage. They pass the combat without much problem.\n\nThen they went to area 10, were the promethium was. They both failed the INT test to see that there was promethium. Then I thought \"Welp, it was good while it lasted\". Then, it happened.\n\nS was the first one with the initiative, and he shoot the poor bastard with his heavy pistol. He rolled a 0 to damage. And then a 9. He just one shoot him. Poor guy. I then told them about the gimmick of the room, and they were \"holly fuck, we almost die here\".\n\nThey finally decided to go the point 3, were S was slaugthered, and needed to burn a fate point. And now he is without ammo and with only 1 wound. They also made a small visit to Rat, but nothing really special happened there.\n\nAnd finally, they went to point 11, ready to fight the plaguebeared. And here almost, almost happened something that would probably developed into a pretty interting heretical campaign.\n\nS told me that he wanted to talk to the demon, but at the end he decided against it. Almost. I would have had the plaguebearer to convince them to join chaos (inmortality, a very large family, papa nurgle, power, happines...),  it would had become a BC campaign, but, at the end it didn't became one. They just killed it without actually much problem, they rolled pretty good on the fight.\n\nAfter they exited the mine, a representant of the inquisitor greeted them and told them \"Welcome to the inquisition\", while a couple of stormtrooper entered to made a final revision.",

When they got to the cave they found a large collection of spiders, snakes, and other cave critters. \n\nBut after a bit they ran into a zombie, and then 2 more, then a skeleton. The deeper they moved into the cave the clearer the situation became: a necromancer had set up shop inside \n\nAfter a hard fought crawl dealing with numerous undead on top of the cave creatures the party found a unique undead, a skeletal champion. Now bear in mind this was a level 1 party, so they were a bit trepidatious. \n\nHowever, the paladin made short work of the champion and after a few rounds it crumpled into dust. After a brief break to chug potions the party slowly entered the necromancer's lair \n\nA hooded figure greeted them and introduced himself as Lord Grimm, commander of the underworld. \n\nHe began to monologue about how he had absolute power and mastery over the undead. Fog rolled into the room and torches began to flicker and dim as he raised his arms and prepared to fight. \n\nAt this point my players were salivating for a fight, there was a beat running through the room with everyone thinking \"BOSS FIGHT, BOSS FIGHT!\" \n\nCombat starts and the gunslinger steps forward and fires \n\nBLAM\n\nThe round blows Lord Grimm's shoulder open, blood and sinew fly everywhere \n\nLord Grimm falls to the ground and begins to cry loudly. Not gentile sobs but the wailing of a hungry babe\n\nAt this point my players are just...confused. The paladin steps forward and actually asks Lord Grimm if he can help \n\nEventually the party heals him and asks him what's going on. \n\nLord Grimm was not a powerful necromancer at all, but the son of an LE wizard who just wanted daddy to love them. So he stole some of his father's scrolls and ran off to create an undead lair. \n\nHis name was actually Myelvin, and all he actually wanted to do was study restoration. \n\nLong story short the party took pity on him and used their connections at the local temple to get Myelvin a job there. \n\nSeveral months later the party was back in town and needed a cleric, Myelvin happily volunteered and ended up saving a party member from a nasty poison.",

He immediately admonished Fauna to use\nthe bell-pull, which was right next to the gate next time. So she pulled it as\nthe servant opened the gates to let them in eliciting a disgusted sigh.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “Ha-ha! Typical druid.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe servant was a skinny hunched Ezmerian of advanced age. He had\na short but pointed white beard, a polished sun-darkened pate, and a well-worn\ndark blue cloak hanging from his boney shoulders. They entered the gate and\nthus the servant guided them through the short outer courtyard into the\nentrance foyer. The primarily Hyvalian style home was a luxurious two story\nwhich they could see as they walked through the courtyard.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe entrance foyer had red plastered walls with a black lacquered\ndouble door in each with only the one through which they were to be led ajar.\nThe ceiling was open to the sky with the tiled roof over-hang angled down to\ndirect rainwater into a shallow central tiled pool, a water collection basin.\nTucked in a corner, a plaster model of the city surrounded by bronze dragon on\na columnar pedestal. The dragon’s gold plating was flaking from the collecting\nverdigris of the bronze underneath.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe led them through the open door into a colonnaded walkway\nsurrounding a formerly lush atrium through which they could see the shuddered\nwindows of the story above that overlooked it. They walked to the right where\nthree archways opened along the walkway, the first being the dining room. All\nthree white plaster walls of this room bore murals depicting well-dressed\ndiners, though in archaic fashion, enjoying drunken feasts of plenty. However,\nthe paint had fallen away with some of the plaster in several places due to\nneglect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe group took their seats in high-backed chairs set around the\nrectangular dining table. The dark wood table was set with gold candlesticks\nand plates of fresh fruit on a plain white cloth. The group was jenky about\nsampling the fruit and the hors d'oeuvre when served fearing poison or drugs.\nGornix (played by Gil) and Excor were loath to eat until Fauna having faith in\nher cult leader partook. Szoo (played by Isis) was stuffing his face\nregardless.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was during hors d'oeuvres that their hostess made her grand\nentrance and introduced herself as Virtra Wefa. She carried herself with great\nconfidence in her elegant attire. Sweeping into the room she glided to her seat\nafter the refined manners of an Ivoran noble. She was quite a beautiful older\nwoman. Although worn deep into her face was a permanent bitterness. She had\nstark black eyes with straight dark auburn tresses that fell well below her\nwaist. Her hair was secured with two large gold hairpins and pulled back tight\nfrom her high ivory forehead. Gold raindrop earrings dangled from her ears.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Ivoran dinner tradition was followed ritualistically not out\nof a true sense of tradition but out of habit carried out joylessly by the lady\nand her servants. Excor and Gornix were the only members of the cabal to\ninteract at this time. They exhibited a refined social aptitude and\nunderstanding of formal Ivoran tradition. This prompting questioning glances\nfrom Fauna and Szoo that were left unanswered. Dinner started with an aperitif,\na strong syrupy yellow wine-liqueur. Awkward conversation and pleasantries\nensued.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVirtra told them that they were awaiting a late and for now\nnameless dinner guest so seconds on the aperitif would be permissible. For some\nreason this prompted Gornix to try to charm the stone faced and grim woman.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGil: “It’s so I can get in there. I want to marry her for her money.” Cris\nhigh-fived him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNevertheless, it was all in vain Virtra easily saw through his\nclumsy overtures. Clearly, she considered him her social inferior though he\ndecided to give his full name and aristocratic lineage in the effort. His full\nname was Achiren Gorenix and he was the youngest son of a minor noble family in\nan Ivoran city-state to the north along the Ivoran Coast.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter an hour or so according to the candle-clock at the rear of\nthe room, the last guest finally arrived. To the consternation of the young\nmages, the long awaited surprise guest was Crochi Aengham. The very same Crochi\nAengham that was the Sapphire Confraternity Seeker that summoned them to the\nguildhouse for a discovery hearing. As he sat, Excor spotted a similar rope\nscar around his collar as Fauna had also happening to spot the same on Virtra\neven under her heavy gold and silver necklace. He did his best to not share\nthis observation via voice or expression.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “D@%n! Why didn’t I notice before?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe GM (me): “Because you didn’t bother to check.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “D@%n guilds! D@%n cults! Screw this I’m not doing anything she wants us for!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDinner ensued. Bread and ale soup with bits of smoked meat and\nonions sprinkled with dried seaweed along with a platter of smoked fish, fried\neel in salty sweet sauce, stacks of steaming flat bread, roasted mild yellow\npeppers, and a very dark purple wine in clay decanters were served. The few\nbits of conversation had in between dishes and dripping mouthfuls acquainted\nthe young mages with Virtra’s dwindling family fortunes. As well as her plan to\nrun for mayoral office on the Green Sash (the Oaks) ticket since she could no\nlonger afford to be a part of the Gold Sashes (for a description of Ezmer’s\npolitical parties see [The Cabal of Eight Pt.8: A Second Meeting](http://rangergamespublishing.com/2017/03/the-cabal-of-eight-pt-8-a-second-meeting/)\\)\\.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce upon a time her family had been of the top nobility but the\ncurrent era had diminished her inherited holdings a generation prior and\nprevented any reclamation on her part by any effort. Excor thought that the\ncandidates had already been declared. She explained that the vote to\nofficialize them had not yet been made. There were just no other contenders\ncurrently. However, she had a plan.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “Ugh, I f@*#in’ hate politics.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter the meal the digestif arrived, a berry-brandy served on a\nwooden tray, and the pipes came out. It increasingly seemed that Virtra and\nCrochi had something to say to the group. Nevertheless, they were saving it\nuntil their hospitality had relaxed their guests. Again, the young mages, save\nFauna, became paranoid after realizing such.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIsis: “Let’s just hear what they got to say and get out of here!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGil: “Yeah man, before they try and do something crazy to us.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVirtra began by telling them that the Dragon Summer (see [The Cabal of Eight Pt.8: A Second Meeting](http://rangergamespublishing.com/2017/03/the-cabal-of-eight-pt-8-a-second-meeting/)) could be an advantage to her and\nher comrades’ goals but didn’t elaborate. Her \"plan\" implied that it\nwould attract Whers to the city somehow. Then she dropped that she wanted the\nmages to do a job for her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVirtra: “A representative from the Breadbasket is arriving in a week or two under guard\nto confirm the Oaks’ candidate, one Firstborn Hufom.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExcor: “Reasonable people for reasonable cost.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “Wait man, they may want us to assassinate him.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe explained that if Hufom did not attend the inter-party vote\nthose who would normally vote with him could be easily swayed. Therefore she\ncould swoop in with her confederates to become the chosen candidate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVirtra: “It would be best if he were to be permanently in dispose.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGornix: “Nope.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIsis: “No WAY!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFauna (still internally trusting her leader): “I dunno guys…”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExcor: “Hell No!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe group had made their decision and in no uncertain terms carved\nit in stone. Full-well knowing that they were now privy to information that\ncould get them all killed they prepared to take their leave . It was likely\nthat assassination attempts were to come their way shortly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExcor (taking a rare break from his pipe): “Well. Just out of curiosity. How much\nwould it pay?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVirtra: “10,000 gold pieces.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFauna: “We’ll do it!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGornix: “Well we just have to stall the guy so he can’t vote right?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSzoo: “Hell YES!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExcor: “Okay we’ll do it but we won’t kill him. We’re not assassins. Also a 2,000 gold\npiece advance from the 10,000.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVirtra: “Done.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore they departed, the time-scale would demand their leaving\nthe city heading towards the breadbasket along the Trade Road East. They hoped\nthat they would run into Hufom already in transit in 5 days’ time on the road.\nVirtra was to supply the driver and a wagon.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOver the next three days the young mages divvied up Virtra’s\nadvance into 500-gp apiece shares, Gornix studied Haxat’s spellbook, and Excor\nbusied himself transferring the rat cages housed in his and Gornix’s apartments\nto Jirek’s warehouse with a pair of porters he had hired for the job. Fauna on\nthe other hand embarked on a small adventure on her own.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn preparation for the coming adventure, Fauna went to pick up\nalchemical supplies and components to brew some potions in the bazaar. She also\nwanted to stock up on yellow lotus and unable to secure a supplier on her own\ntracked down her contact, one Kosapio Belahgastro. Kosapio was a Creschan\nex-pat and somewhat successful sea-trader. From the dusky Creschan woman Fauna\nlearned of some adventurers of the Brighthouse faith, Kosapio being one of the\nfaithful, newly arrived in town that have encountered something that they\ncalled The Tower of the Lotus (see [A\nMage from Poisonwood II Pt.8: Tower of the Lotus](http://rangergamespublishing.com/2015/01/mage-poisonwood-ii-pt-8-tower-lotus/))\nin Rockhollow in addition to a possible lotus dealer. Therefore, the druidess\ndecided to track a lotus dealer in a seafront dive that Kosapio had warned her\nagainst doing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBy late that afternoon, Fauna had found her way to the\naforementioned locale in the harbor district alley-side between the shipwright\nand the Rondel (see [The Cabal of Eight Pt.7: A Red Rat](http://rangergamespublishing.com/2017/01/cabal-eight-pt-7-red-rat/)). It was an infamous\nbilge-polluted watering hole called the Black Barrel due to the scorched rotted\nwood barrel hanging over its saloon doors. From just outside she could smell\nthe gross stink of ammonia, sticky dried ale, and a hint of the soaked lemon\npeel used halfheartedly to scrub the bar. As she entered, she saw a mostly\nnaked corpse lying face down in a dark pool of its own coagulated blood. The\nBlack Barrel was full of salty sea dogs, some obviously pirates mixed with\nthugs and various other shady individuals. Their bodies certainly added a\npalpable spice to the already thick and foul air within. None acknowledged the\ncorpse.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo ignoring the corpse and the thick atmosphere Fauna surveyed the\nscummy crowd. She located her man holed up in a far corner surrounded by\nBronzehead bodyguards who occupied the tables to either of his sides. Without\nmuch issue, she was able to procure some yellow lotus, 5 doses at 100 gp each.\nAfter that she continued to the market district to purchase more supplies\namounting to a half wheel of cheese, 2 shovels, two 50lb. sacks, and 40 days\ntrail rations.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “Man! One-Hundred Gold Pieces a Dose! You should’ve went for my contact um …\nBabia’s shop she might have a new shipment.” (see [The Cabal of Eight Pt.6: Gold Devil](http://rangergamespublishing.com/2017/01/cabal-eight-pt-6-gold-devil/) for more info on Babia)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe following day before their departure the young mages continued\nto hurry to prepare and finish a few things. Excor &amp; Gornix spent the day\ncopying spells from Haxat’s book and Fauna brewed a *See All* potion. Gornix\nalso managed to brew a _Bear’s Endurance _potion but which had the opposite\neffects (a fortunate[?] roll of a Natural 1). Finally they attended their cabal\nmeeting on the 28^(th) of Early Summer of which their leaders (Belrae\nand Riahm) were still absent yet to return from their expedition. The meeting\nitself was uneventful. The young mages had enough courtesy to alert the other\npresent members (Jirek and Bumble) that they were also due to depart and would\nmiss the next meeting on the 7^(th) of High Summer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe young mages filtered into the taproom of the Red Helm after\nthe meeting. Gornix demanded from his companions that they have a “real plan”\nbefore they left on “the mission”. The players actually did spend about an hour\narguing back and forth and coming up with various plans and ideas. Ultimately,\nhowever, they decided to “just wing it”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next morning of the 1^(st) of High Summer as the\ngolden orange of dawn was still just peaking over the walls the integral four\nmages met at the city gates. There they found the wagon waiting and its almost\ntoo friendly teamster, Corje ready to move out. They began to ride away through\nthe massive city gates at opening. As they passed under the great arch, Excor\nspotted the ever ubiquitous noose scar around Corje’s throat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “They sent that guy to make sure the job’s done. Whatever. Long as I don’t see\n‘em do it.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHis tone of voice suddenly switched.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCris: “Or to get rid of us after it’s done!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo Be Continued…",

        "text": "We've all known each other for about six years now, but never actually met in real life before, so we schedule a meetup. The meetup goes fantastic, and then someone suggests tabletop.\n\nIt's awesome. We need to do this more often.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nNahr Alma, 6 meter tall Chaotic Evil (he's kind of an asshole irl, but he never really means it) Trox Barbarian, stremf incarnate.\n\nKharlos the Chaotic Good Tiefling gunslinger\n\nand Deawen the Neutral Good Half-Succubus Bard (me. I normally prefer diplomacy over combat).\n\n\nIt's our first time ever playing pathfinder (except for Nahr Alma) so our GM just says \"fuck it, just do whatever, but make it work\" so we do.\n\nFirst off we encounter a dungeon with no monsters (by accident, our GM forgot to add monsters in.). Floor crumbles beneath us into a desert-esque dungeon.\n\nDeawen decides to sense-magic in the room, and the sand smiles at her. \n\nOh god what. \n \nThe sand points to a door, which she open and it pushes her in and tries to drown her friends. \n\nOh, great.\n\nNahr alma tries to punch sand, which somehow works, and we progress to next room, which has no magic sand anymore.\n\nThey find a Gnoll and her hyena frolicking in a room. Deawen wants to talk, but Nahr Alma wants to kill.\n\nDeawen fails the Initiative roll, and Nahr Alma cleaves the Gnoll in two in a surprise attack.\n\nLater on we find a door that leads somewhere, and instead of opening the door, Nahr Alma takes it upon himself to uppercut the door.\n\nHe rolls a 20.\n\nThe door crashes through the ceiling and flies through three stories before stopping.\n\nDeawen convinces the massive slab of crabmeat to allow her to check the next door.\n\nSo she does, and hears skittering.\n\nCrabmeat decides to throw Deawen in without following up.\n\nDeawen was thrown against her will into three giant rats and a big-ass spider. \n\nDeawen gets bit and suffers from a disease. All because Nahr Alma is an asshole.\n\nAfter the party clears the enemies out, they find a chest.\n\nInside the chest are gold pieces and a scroll. \n\nInstead of letting Deawen \"Sense Magic\", Nahr Alma decides to pick up the scroll, and wipe his ass with it.\n\nHe now has one of the greasiest assholes ever, since that was a scroll of Create Grease. Jackass.\n\nQuote from the Master: \"No, you can't use Deawen to wipe your ass\"\n\nLater on, Deawen opens a door to find the single largest Rat Swarm they've ever seen. The entire floor is a sea of malnourished, hungry rats. Deawen casts something to cause them to be afraid, yet it doesn't do much. Kharlos runs back to the other room's door, waiting to close it when Nahr Alma and Deawen arrive, yet the rats are too fast. Deawen arrives, but the rats start climbing up Nahr Alma's legs. \n\nThe group is panicking, thinking they'll lose their powerhouse in one of the cruelest fates.\n\nDeawen charms Nahr Alma, and incites the hulking behemoth to attack. Nahr Alma gets angry, and now has a plus six AND a plus eight to attack.\n\nNahr Alma rolls to attack.\n\nHe rolls a 20.\n\nThe room Nahr Alma is in now is devoid of rats, and the room (and Nahr Alma) is now painted a fine crimson-red.\n\n\nLater on, Kharlos think's it'll be funny to put a dead rat on Nahr Alma's head and try to William-Tell that rat. \n\nHe rolls a six. \n\nHe shoots Nahr Alma right in the cheek, and, almost poetically, Nahr Alma brings his blade down to obliterate Kharlos.\n\nDeawen wonders what she did in this life to deserve this party.",

        "text": "So, I was kinda hoping to make a whole series out of this, but, y'know, *life* happened. However, the big payoff moment was last night, and it was *awesome*. That said, there was a little too much going on for me to really have my moment in the spotlight, but hey, at least it worked.\n\nNevertheless, I had an awesome session, and I wanted to share...\n\n--------------\n\n**Previously, on D&amp;D:**\n\nI'm playing a Cleric (who I've nicknamed \"Princess\") that is secretly a heretic: she believes that the setting-specific Sun God is the same individual as the War God, and worships both as a single entity. However, such belief has been declared a heresy. For this reason, Princess portrays herself as a Healing Cleric of the Sun God, but is actually a War Cleric devoted to her dual God.\n\nTo help keep up the facade, Princess has been acting like, well, a *princess*--she's been acting like a stuck-up, fussy, airheaded bimbo, in an effort to blend into expectations. However, over the past several sessions, I've purposely let some things slip:\n\n* Princess has had several moments of intense, private prayer, where her facade has slipped completely away. One of the players, a paladin, noticed that she was not reciting the standard prayers, though he didn't appear to pick up on what that meant. \n\n* Some of the players caught Princess performing an early-morning staff kata, part of her daily devotional practices. They asked that she teach them the kata, which she has been doing--but at least one or two have noticed that, while alone, the kata she performs is different.\n\n* Due mostly to Princess's actions, the party has gotten in trouble with a mob boss. Princess stormed out of a meeting with said boss, despite his threats that things would go badly for her. Later, the party caught up to Princess just as she was shoving a body in a dumpster; examination showed that he was one of the Boss's thugs, beaten nearly senseless, with a number of broken ribs. Princess refused to answer questions about what she had done.\n\n* Princess made it very, *very* clear that she wanted nothing to do with the mob boss, especially since he forced the players to run some drugs for him. Princess *very nearly* destroyed the drugs in transit, then torched the depot they were picking them up from, but the party managed to stop her.\n\n* Princess has dodged questions about her background by claiming that she has *Enemies,* ones that are too dangerous for her to even talk about. \n\n----------------------------------------\n\n**The Reveal**\n\nThe party was tracking an NPC through the woods, when the trail took an abrupt detour into the underbrush. Princess followed the rest of the party into the brush, making her displeasure known with little gasps of fright and irritation, which most of the players ignored.\n\nThe trail led them straight through a clearing deep in the woods, where the mobsters had been growing their drugs. Princess very nearly torched the clearing on sight, but the other players convinced her to back down, at least until they found their target. In either case, the target was apparently caught up in what was going on. \n\nThe party followed the trail until, suddenly, it emptied out into a clearing. There, in the midst of a ruined temple, their target was cornered by three hardened, professional killers. When it became clear that the NPC had been working for the mob until things went wrong, and now they had come to silence him, the party leapt into action.\n\nPrincess helped heal and buff the party a little, but wasn't helping a ton: we have a large party, and were able to dogpile most of the combatants. That is, until one--a heavily-tattoed, bare-chested man--began to chant in an ancient language, and his tattoos began to glow.\n\n\"Focus tattoos!\" [i.e., focus on the tattooed man] Princess (uncharacteristically) cried.\n\nTattoo Man completed his ritual, and a portal opened behind him. From this portal, a high-level Devil emerged, wreathed in flame, minions in his wake.\n\nAnd then, Princess stepped forward. \n\nPrincess swore an oath to her gods, then ran into the midst of battle. She cast Magic Weapon on her staff, allowing it to nullify the resistance on the Devil and Tattoo Man, who had gone into a Barbarian rage. Princess attacked Tattoo Man first, unloading several of her War Cleric abilities on him, and managed to hit him several times in a single round, knocking him unconcious just as he was about to complete a second ritual.\n\nThen, it was the Devil's turn. At the start of the turn, the GM asked everyone to make a save against being Frightened. Before anyone could roll, I cried out \"Wait! I have a buff for that!!\" \n\nDue to a combination of setting-specific racial abilities and feats, being within 60 feet of Princess gave everyone advantage against Fear saves. About 2/3 of the party made the (rather difficult) save as a result.\n\nBut then, Princess kicked off her next ability. \n\nThe other side-effect of those feats is that, if Princess made a fear save, she could force the source of that fear to make the same save themselves, or become frightened of *her*.\n\nThe Devil failed that save.\n\nSo, to recap: Princess charged in, dropped the demon-summoner despite Barbarian rage, protected the party from the fear-aura of a CR20 Devil, then made said Devil terrified of *her*.\n\nThe party, Princess included, continued to fight the Devil. Princess's staff katas played into her fighting style; some of the moves she was practicing came through in my flavor descriptions of how she dodged hits, etc. The Devil, still Frightened of her, attacked her with everything he had, bringing her to a single hit point before he fled back to the Lower Planes.\n\nEveryone took a deep breath, then began to pick up the pieces. While everyone was looting bodies, etc., Princess grabbed a sword and beheaded the corpses of the killers. When they got back to town, she mailed their heads to their boss. On their way out, she did, indeed, burn the secret drug garden to the ground.\n\nShe also took a few minutes to explain herself to everyone, telling them that, as a heretic, she had a bullseye painted on her back. If what they had seen her do ever got out, *all* of them would be in serious trouble. So... don't mention that, okay?\n\nPrincess then promptly dropped into bed and slept for like twelve hours.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nI'm not sure I could have asked for a better scenario for my reveal--especially since the dice cooperated. The image of Princess, previously a shrinking violet, staring down a full-size Devil will probably be one of my favorites for years to come (and one that I'll have to comission some art for :) ). \n\nThere was only one problem: this, apparently, happened to be the session where *everyone else* got their big character moment. \n\nWe found out that the NPC we'd been tracking, a longtime ally, was actually a werewolf; said werewolf NPC was working with the Mob that we'd been hunting; said Mob was actually a Devil-worshipping cult; and, to top it all off, another PC revealed that he was a Warlock, with a patron of an ancient, forgotten evil god. \n\nI kinda wish that I could've had the spotlight to myself, as the fact that Princess was secretly a hyper-violent socipath kinda got lost in the kerfuffle. I'm not gonna complain too much, though; it was an *awesome* session, and we really had fun.\n\nPlus, having the dice actually cooperate while trying to make my dumb blonde cheerleader go super-saiyan was *awesome.*",

        "text": "I started playing BDO as a ranger and had little interest in it, my friend u/oriolez had a brilliant idea to go swimming to unlock a node so he could sell his fish at higher prices, and I decided to go with him out of boredom, so we swam pretty far. It's worth noting at this point that the game does have sailing, but we were both on level 11 or so characters and didn't have nearly enough money for a boat. After we made it to our objective area, we decided to continue our journey, because we saw a location on the map labelled \"Pirate Island.\" \n\nWe eventually made it to Pirate Island and then realized that the enemies were way out of our league, but we also didn't want to turn back because we'd gone fairly far from the mainland at this point, so we kept swimming further and further out. Eventually we stopped finding islands, and we just swam through ocean, then we started seeing creatures, pink shark things, and the like. We swam for actual hours before finding a chunk of destroyed ship in the middle of the ocean, and then we decided it was a good place to stop and take a break, so we climbed atop it, and noticed a very large (much larger than anything we'd seen so far) creature in the water. \n\nWe watched it for a while, I started taking screenshots of our boat chunk and the creature, it got very close, directly underneath of us, and nearly came out of the water. When we didn't die on it's first approach, we assumed we were safe from it and it couldn't kill us since we were out of the water. It came back around and got nice and close again, slid up out of the water once more, and we both fell dead to the floor of our boat carcass. \n\nOur journey ended because we didn't want to log out since we were taking screenshots, I have no doubt if we had just signed out then and there and started up again tomorrow or another day, we would have lived to go even further.\n\nEdit to add: Photos of the beast and our demise. http://imgur.com/a/AK4mO",

        "text": "This will be a short one, but I had to share~\n\nThis week, I attended a My Little Pony convention, and took the opportunity to demo Tails of Equestria, the official, Hasbro-licensed My Little Pony RPG. Say what you will, but I'm quite fond of the system: it does a lot of small things to emphasize non-combat skills/behavior, exploring your talents, and other themes from the show.\n\nSo, of course, I promptly hacked it into a sort of dungeon crawl.\n\nOf the group of randos I had assembled for the party, none had experience with the game. There were four adults and one teenager, the latter of whom will be the protagonist for our story. \n\nNow, I have to explain: I feel like I can't make too much fun of this kid. I got the impression he had a disability of some sort, but it wasn't exactly the place to ask. And, we all have at least one bad OC in our lives--we gotta get it out of our system before we can get really creative. But, nevertheless...\n\n[](/sgpopcorn)Final bit of background: within the last season or two, the My Little Pony show added a character named Starlight Glimmer, a[ Green Ranger](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger) of sorts. This is important, I promise. \n\n\n\nI sit everyone down, explain the dead-simple-basics of the already-simple system, then walk them through character creation. I encourage them to make use of their own pony Original Characters, which works out fairly well. We get things organized, and then we introduce the characters.\n\n[Paraphrased, of course]\n\n&gt;Adult 1: My name's Oreo, and I like flying!\n\n&gt;Adult 2: My name's Daffodil, and I like cupcakes!\n\n&gt;Adult 3: My name's Snowflake, and I do card tricks!\n\n&gt;Adult 4: My name's Kumquat, and I'm a farmer!\n\n&gt;Teenager: My name is **Bloodshed Glimmer,** and I am a robot-pony with six legs and **all the swords.** I am a failed magical experiment, tormented by the meaninglessness of my own existence, and when I make an attack close to a wall, my blades may get stuck, stunning me!\n\nwtf.jpg\n\nIn my head, I run down the list of reasons why this won't work, not the least of which is that 1) Um, tonal mismatch much? 2) combat is unexpectedly harsh, so a combat build is asking for trouble, and 3) *there are no swords in this game.* Out loud I say, \"Well, there's no rules for swords, so I'm going to rule they don't do any additional damage.\"\n\nDuring play, the teenager--ahem, *Bloodshed Glimmer*--didn't do too bad, actually. He helped out the party a fair amount, did some creative things with his abilities, and didn't demand that he *eviscerate the heretics* whenever he attacked. However, he had one habit that made us all stare--whenever he described an attack, he actually *acted out* the attack itself, making all sorts of super-anime, Star Wars Kid-type moves. And, after the attack resolved, he would repeat the motion at least once or twice to himself, almost like he was practicing.\n\n[](/knmmlaugh) The game ended when, among other things, Bloodshed Glimmer sacrificed himself to distract an evil, angry god, which helped the other party members run away. He actually lasted a turn or two longer than expected, which allowed the rest of the party to sneak off without the God even knowing they were there. So it all worked out, in the end.\n\nOn the one hand--I think he did good. Everyone has at least one face-palmy OC / RPG cahracter in their lives, and it was good he got it out of his system. Also, for his first time, he did a good job roleplaying, especially that final fight.\n\nOn the other hand--*Bloodshed Glimmer And All The Swords.*",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6me1c7/minecraft_the_war_of_the_last_island/",
        "text": "**PREAMBLE:**\n-\n\nThis story happened a few years back, and if I'm being completely honest my memory is a bit on the faded side. I was still below the legal drinking age, which in Canada is 19, and I was asked by a friend if I could come to a LAN party they were hosting. A little more than a dozen people. The game was going to be modded Minecraft. For the life of me I cannot remember which mods, so I can't provide a List. I know Voltz, or at least a few of the mods that made up Voltz were on there.\n\nMostly we played Shooters during these LAN Parties. We'd done about 6 sessions of Team Fortress 2 and Old Quake, though slightly more of the former. Most of us weren't hurting for cash or anything, but it did need to be something that everyone could afford. I'm honestly kind of amazed that the friend that organized it was able to set these things up, though maybe it's really easy and I'm just stupidly incompetent. Anyways, he had just finished reading about something called the [Closed Map Experiment](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers/pc-servers/665978-closed-map-experiment) before they set this up. For those that aren't familiar, the CME is a gametale, that while ultimately fictional, is none-the-less a generally entertaining read, and it inspired my friend to build up her own version. Now, my friend, he's obsessive about her hobbies. It's probably why he was able to organize these things so well.\n\nSo the map that had been chosen had been heavily modified with MCedit. Now the CME story just had bedrock walls, the rest of the map was still present. In this case, only a small area was built. I think she generated an area naturally and then carved it out, but I have never used MCedit so I have no fucking clue. So, we had this small area of land (by minecraft standards, by regular game standards it was big), forest to the west, grassland to the east, a swamp in the forest and a frozen north. A river divided the northern snow forest from the rest of the land. This land was encircled by an ocean, there were a couple of Islands with trees that jutted out from the ocean but it was mostly just ocean. The ocean went out for a bit and then stopped. Where the ocean stopped there were these big Pillars of Obsidian jutting out from the sea. It was a fucking neat visual. Beyond the Pillars there was nothing, and dragons. Big red dragons. They never went past the pillars, but they served as a way to stop players from building floating fortresses in the nothing. My friend called this map the Last Island. There was story about Dragons eating the world and this Island being protected by Obsidian monoliths that we were told in the form of books we'd all been given, as well as maps, stone tools, and a set of leather armour. Now, I think my friend wanted to cut out the initial brief wooden tools bit, which is only about 15 minutes, but he was playing the gamemaster, and I guess she wanted to get to the fun bits first. Also, this is the point where my friend stops being the only character, so from now on my friend is the Overseer.\n\nAnyways, the Overseer gave us about 15 minutes to devote to choosing sides, and once we'd picked she organised us into teams. I wound up in a team with two others, a guy and a girl, both of whom I knew. The guy was a nice bloke, and good conversation, but he was not good at games. The girl was much the same, though she was also Albino, so I guess that's kind of neat. And as for myself, I call myself u/BadIdeaBloke, and generally I feel that name fits me pretty well. So my team was a guy named Guy (pronounced Gui, and while that is his real name, it's generic enough that I don't feel like a bad person for using it), a girl who we will call Mel, and the Bad Idea Bloke. We would be the Kings of the Last Island, and that was what we called ourselves. Technically it should have been Kings and Queens of the Last Island but that doesn't sound as nice.\n\nWe were one of seven teams:\n\n* The Kings of the Last Island, three person team\n\n* The Gigantomachy, also three people. One of whom was charismatic as hell, and also probably a Percy Jackson nut.\n\n* The Badasses, two people, neither of which were exactly creative. Or Badass.\n\n* The Fireflies. I'd say it was a Last of Us reference, but it was new at the time and I don't think anyone of us owned a playstation. Might have been a Firefly reference. Two people\n\n* The Lannisters, definitely a Game of Thrones reference, though I didn't know either of the two that well, so I can't say if it was a books or show reference. Two person team\n\n* The Punisher. Single man team, comics book nerd, and the sort of person who would be called an Edgelord today.\n\n* The Kevin. I actually don't remember this one was called. It was a name though, and with the mandatory \"The\" in front of it. I'm thinking Kevin. Also, probably not a reference to *the* Kevin, because this takes place before that post, though possibly a reference to *a* Kevin.\n\nAnyways, that's about 14 people, from about 3 different schools, divided into 7 uneven teams. Including the Overseer, This is a 15 person LAN party, playing on a Minecraft map with limited resources.\n\nThe game began in a small village, with a smithy, a church and two houses. We had 2 minutes to get our bearings, memorize the skins of everyone, and take stock of our gear. Once those two minutes were up, we were told, our invincibility would end, and so would the invisible walls. Now, the logical problem with that is that once the invincibility ends, what's to stop the spawn from becoming a bloodbath? Just as the two minutes ended we got our answer.\n\nA big fucking bomb went off beneath our feet. And so begins session 1\n\nSESSION 1\n=\n\nSpecifically a Sonic Bomb, a bomb added by a minecraft mod called ICBM. We were scattered across the map. I found myself in a delightful hole in the ground. There was snow, running water, and a beautiful deer. The deer was promptly crushed by a big stone. Not long after the deer got pancaked my immortality ended. I could die now. And so could my teammates. The three of us were sitting in the living room of the Overseer's parent house. We had a lovely view of a real snowy forest, one which we ignored to look at a much blockier forest. We agreed to build our base on the small island Mel landed on. It was an easily defended position, and Mel could begin work immediately. Guy had landed a short ways away, and reached the island in about a minute. I was a bit further, so when I made the trip, I ran one of the Lannisters. If I had to describe him in a sentence, he thinks that he's Tywin, when he's really Joffrey. We both pulled swords, circled the spot for a bit, then Joffrey backed off a cliff. Whoops. He died in that chasm too, though I'm not sure if it was fall damage or monsters.\n\nAnyways, so once all three Kings were at the base, we formed our plan. We would build an easy to miss entrance, and create a massive underground bunker to:\n\nA) Create generators for potentially scarce resources, like Trees, Meat, and Leather (we needed it to insulate wiring)\n\nB) Build Silos to obliterate our enemies\n\nC) Trapmaster the shit out of. We wanted defensive turrets, and we wanted a lot of them. Secrecy would be our greatest asset, but we wanted our base to kill anything that wasn't us inside it.\n\nSo our first session was largely gathering resources, Guy gathered wood, but more importantly, saplings, Mel began to dig for ores, but also for caves, and in those caves, Slime. We wanted a sticky-piston entrance to our bunker, that would be impossible to spot, and be hidden in a place nobody would look. I on the other hand, excavated our base and built our lair. Constructing some primitive furnaces, and some of the basic modded stuff, I realized that I wouldn't be able to make Steel, which was a necessity for many of our recipes, because steel required a machine that required steel to make. I wasn't the only one to realize this, and a few of us told the overseer. The Overseer checked and then the Overseer went and gave a member of each team a stack of steel, but also told us that if we died and lost it, we would have to steal some steel.\n\nWhile I wasn't present, the Punisher seemed to realize that if he killed the only member of the Kevin, who we will call Kevin, he would be guaranteed to deprive Kevin of steel. So he went and shot Kevin in the face. Essentially he made Kevin non-competitive, depriving him of a vital resource in the early game, and permanently put Kevin in last place in this arms race. The Punisher's player realized very early on that it would be possible to deprive players of resources necessary to survive, and made that his means of victory. He couldn't lose if nobody had the gear to challenge him. Kevin was an easy target, but the Punisher was not a tracker, and was incapable of finding the bases of the other players.\n\nThe Fireflies and the Gigantomachy also had a brief skirmish. They traded blows, but ultimately the fireflies had no intention of sticking around. They put part of the forest to the torch, and beat it. I don't know much about this fight, but it was one of the first notable resource destructions.\n\nThe first session, while containing the duel between the Bad Idea Bloke and Joffrey, as well as the assassination of Kevin, was ultimately uneventful. We built up our strength, the other teams built up their strength, and Kevin had his arm sawed off in the first day. I did realize what a couple of the mods were. ICBM was obvious, as well as the rest of the Voltz pack, but I also realized that a mod that added more animals was in play. I saw a deer in the snowy forest, Guy nearly got eaten by a giant snake in the swamp, and we saw a few Sharks in the ocean, none of which appear in vanilla minecraft.\nI also figured out that a Gun mod of some kind was in play, as when the Overseer gave out the Steel the character was armed with some sort of rifle. And so in ends Session 1\n\nSESSION 2\n=\n\nThe next day we had scheduled to continue, but ultimately complications prevented Kevin's player and two of the Gigantomachy from attending. We could still have played, but it probably would have been a dick move. No game is worth missing a family dinner, or an Edgar Wright film in theaters for. We got together again the day after anyways. \n\nThe Second Session got into a flying start when a Dragon literally flew overhead. It roared loudly, and it scorched the even smaller Island next to our already small island, before moving over land. Mel followed, and found that an Obsidian Spire had erupted in the spot where the Hypersonic Bomb went off. The dragon flew into a hole in the spire, and stayed there. Mel had taken a skeleton kit, steel sword, light armour and paxel, which was fortunate, because when she scaled that spire, she was roasted by the scaled beast that was now inhabiting the spire. After a fairly horrible Albino joke, though admittedly made by one, Mel respawned in her room of the bunker, and we continued. \n\nTwo others tried to scale that spire. Joffrey of the Lannisters, tried, and now I have to bring Quentyn Martell into this game of thrones comparison. The Leader of the Gigantomachy, who I will call Porphyrion (I like to think that I am very smart. This is a delusion) scaled it too, and while he survived the dragon, he did not survive the trip down. Splat.\n\nIt's also at roughly this point that resource shortages became an obvious issue. Significant chunks of both forests were gone, and the Marsh was no longer a marsh. Most of us had stored saplings, so we weren't necessarily scared, but we were still concerned. Additionally, most of us had taken the time to read the CME after the overseer mentioned it offhand, so all of us were familiar with how the story claimed that grass disappeared. While in a vanilla minecraft game it probably wouldn't happen unless someone deliberately wanted to, in this game we had advanced explosives, some of which would have been capable of wiping out a third of the landmass we had access to. And we were going to use those explosives.\n\nAdditionally, the Obsidian spire's appearance demonstrated that the overseer had massive map alterations planned, and that the map was going to get a lot more hostile. \n\nThe Badasses and the Kevin quickly relocated underground. My group began heavy work on our Arboretum and our farm. We captured a couple of Sharks and moved them into our base for the supervillain lair feel. Brought home some sheep and cows to farm. Brought down some grass. Built nuclear silo. Got working power running. While Guy and Mel worked on the bunker, I was out doing recon on our rivals.\n\nI encountered multiple dens, small underground holes dug, filled with chests and basic machinery. I assumed these belonged to the Punisher, as the machines used required steel, and I had not been able to find his base of operations. I assumed at the time that he was operating nomadically, using these dens to hide supplies and create materials. I wasn't completely wrong, but he did have a base, just a hidden one.\n\nThe Lannisters had built a castle on a cliff in the north, but it was mainly an entrance to a complex that I was unable to fully explore. The complex was winding and mazelike, but most of the vital functions were kept in the heart, which I never saw.\n\nThe Badasses had abandoned a wooden cabin, with an unfinished bunker accessible through a trapdoor in the basement. There was leftover wiring, as well as some leftover workbenches, but nothing expensive. I put the cabin to the torch and left. I didn't find their base in this session.\n\nThe Gigantomachy base was well hidden, and ultimately it eluded me. As did the fireflies.\n\nThe Kevin had swum out to one of the obsidian pillars, and began constructing a cobblestone fortress. When I swam out to investigate, I wound up encountering the Kevin, and I got into a fight. Steel bested Bronze, and Kevin was sent plummeting off the edge of the world. He did respawn and jump me, but I managed to land on a balcony overlooking the void. Kevin was unarmoured, but he'd picked up an Iron sword from his chest.Two swordsmen, duking it out at the end of the world, waterfalls raging in the background. Was pretty cool, and Kevin put up a good fight. Dragon wound up killing the both of us though.\n\nI don't think anyone in game actually fought one of the dragons in fair combat. They used the same model as the Ender Dragon, but apparently they weren't nearly as tough. Nobody ever really beat one though. If they had of been a regular spawn it might have happened, but they only spawned in places we weren't supposed to go, like beyond the Pillars.\n\nBut yeah, scouting didn't really accomplish much. I had a good idea of where the Lannisters were, but ultimately the rest of the factions eluded me, and despite me finding Kevin's lair, neither of us would return.\n\nUltimately Session 2 did conclude with my faction getting a hold of a significant amount of high end gear, with diamond tools and armour made out of some ore I forget that was added by a mod. Mel was well on her way to completing a power armour set, and Guy had managed to build us some Shotguns, but conflict was brewing. While I didn't know it, both the Gigantomachy and the Fireflies had put significant amounts of work into their missile silos. As the overseer announced the end of Session 2, and gave us our 10 minutes to wrap up, we also received the first real act of war.\n\nThe Punisher had found our base.\n\nHe was armed with a basic rifle, and he was carrying explosives. He announced his presence by shooting Guy in the back, before lobbing a grenade at us. Guy was killed by the grenade, and I was hurt. Mel survived unscathed, but was shot and killed before she could counterattack. As both of them respawned and grabbed our backup gear, I took cover as the Punisher dashed for our reactor. The path did wind up taking him past Guy's room, who had been able to arm himself with a pistol. We took pursuit, and fought the punisher in the reactor room. The Punisher managed to set a charge in the reactor, but I was able to use some shears to defuse the bomb (which I believe is a mechanic added by a mod), saving the reactor and giving Guy time to shoot the Punisher in the face, but he did kill me before Guy got him.\n\nAnd so ends Session 2, the opening shots of our war.\n\nSESSION 3\n=\n\nAt this point the spirit of the CME reared it's ugly head. See, part of what the mods added were mechanized quarries,ways to automatically mine large chunks of the map. Only a couple of us had completed any, with the Gigantomachy having a functional below ground setup, while the lannisters had a large aboveground quarry. We had a small one, but we were hoping to upgrade to a larger setup. But the problem with quarries was that they cleared a *ton* of land, very fast, and without player input. It's useful, but it can easily expose a base. In this case the map was small enough that that's indeed what happened. The Lannister quarry excavated open part of the Badasses base, and ultimately sparked a conflict between them.\n\nAdding on to that, the Overseer continued their map changing, adding new obsidian spires to three spots on the map, and with it 4 new dragons. I think maybe we were supposed to kill these, maybe that would have stopped the spire growth.\n\nThe two badasses marched from the grassland to the snowy forest where the Lannister base was. Badass one was equipped with a suit of power armor, with a jetpack and a plasmacannon built in. He wrecked up the lannister's shit. His buddy only had a Plasma rifle and healing grenades, but covering fire was useful. The Lannisters had good armour and sonic cannons, but they couldn't compete. The second lannister used one of their Thermobaric explosives to take out both of the badasses, as well as most of the valuable things in the base, while the other escaped with their remaining explosives, with them planning to regroup later\n\nMeanwhile the Fireflies completed their project. Using diamond gear, they mined though the obsidian pillar in the middle of the map and gathered the resources they needed. They built a nether portal, lit the flame, opened the gate, and walked through.\n\nAnd promptly fell into nothing.\n\nThe Nether was gone. The Overseer had removed it, replaced it with a void, populated with demonic figures only seen in the distance (enemies derived from the wither boss, with a slightly altered model and health pool but the same animations. Like the dragons). Important discovery. Also, they lost some expensive gear. But otherwise the fireflies were able to keep their heads down, their base was well hidden.\n\nWe weren't so lucky. The Punisher knew where we were, and he came *very* close to creating a nuclear meltdown in our base last time. We didn't want there to be a next time, so me and guy went on an expedition to find his base and obliterate it, once and for all. We didn't find it, and we realized that despite how small the map was, there was a still an underground large enough to easily hide the sort of small compact base this guy would build. We weren't going to find it without a lead. So, that's what we did. We waited for him to come, drove him off, and tailed him back to his hideout. We followed him through a hidden door, through a cavern lit only by Lava, into the *tiny* headquarters he had established. We had co-ordinates know, and we planned to obliterate his base. \n\nICBM has these things called Regeneration bombs. They revert a region back to what it was before the players altered it. We detonated one right above his base, erasing all his gear, and sealing him inside of a stone tomb. Nobody figured it out, but these could have been used to beat the resource ban, and the nether erasure, but nobody figured that out. I think that disappointed the overseer. \n\nBut we managed to disable the Punisher, and with that, 3 of the 7 factions were crippled. It was about to be 4. \n\nThe Lannisters raided the base of the Badasses. Joffrey was obliterated by a mining laser, but the second Lannister, who I will call Lancel, raided the badasses vault, and stole advanced explosives, which he used in conjunction with the explosives he brought to send the Badasses base to high hell. He and Joffrey lost all their advanced tech, but so did the badasses.\n\nNow at this point, we'd basically had several factions get sent back to the stone age, rather inefficiently too, Missle Silos probably could have solved the Badasses problem easily, though their silos might have been eaten by the quarry.\n\nAnd with that, 4 factions were in the stone age. While all four remained a presence, none of them had the resources to build explosives of the sort needed to compete, or the guns to survive single combat, or even the beds to have a reliable base and point of respawn. It was between the final 3 factions now, us, the Gigantomachy and the Fireflies.\n\nAnd that wraps up the penultimate session\n\nSESSION 4\n=\n\nFrankly I'm surprised we all still came. The Kevin had been a laughingstock the entire game, the Punisher had lost any chance of his resource destruction plan working, and both the Lannisters and the Badasses lacked the resources to rebuild. But they still came. And they had plans\n\nNow, of course the map changed. The overseer implemented the Deepest Dark, removed daylight from the equation. The overworld was permanently dark, monsters would spawn at all hours. I think that the ultimate goal of player created destruction was abandoned in favour of simply having us duke it out in a much faster apocalypse. At this point we had done a number on the resources, they weren't easy to find, and if you lost your base your probably lost your means of getting steel, which you couldn't replace.\n\nNow, the Fireflies were moving into a backup plan. Their previous plan of, hide in the nether and nuke the world was a bust, so they needed to obliterate both Us and the Gigantomachy. They weren't at the point of having the explosive capabilities both of their enemies had, but they had two sets of powered armour. All they needed was enough explosives. Now their base was located around the spire, and they were in fact working on building a Fusion Reactor and an Accelerator to power their base. \n\nNever completed it. An alliance, made up of the Badasses, the Lannisters and the Kevin launched an assault on their base. I think they tailed them. The Alliance ransacked the base, putting it to the torch, stealing all the valuables and resources. Once the Fireflies were dead and their beds destroyed, the Badasses and the Lannisters tried to kill each other over the rewards. Joffrey took a bullet and had to respawn, but the fight was pretty close. That is until the Kevin, who everyone had kind of just forgotten at that point, detonated the Fireflies' sole nuclear explosive, killing him, the remaining Badasses and Lannisters, and the Fireflies that were trying to sneak back into their base. That effectively crippled all of the involved factions for the rest of the Session, and given that this was the last one, it was effectively fatal. We'd been tossing around the Kevin like you would expect. They're the sort of person that chooses to play solo without a plan, and the Kevin managed to knock 3 teams out of the game at the end came out of nowhere for me. But, with the fireflies gone and the crippling of the Lannisters and the badasses, it was just the Kings of the Last Island versus the Gigantomachy. \n\nAnd the Kings had been plotting. We'd built Silos, at the bottom of the ocean. We had camouflaged them, and hidden them from view, and it was finally time for them to be used. We fired nuclear weapons on the mainland, clearing it of all remaining surface resources, and revealing to us the lair of the Gigantomachy. Now, at this point, the map was a mess. the ocean was flooding into a massive stone wasteland, the Obsidian pillars were still standing, but the Dragons were dead. The land was illuminated by the fires we had lit, and the Gigantomachy base was positioned near the southern end of the landmass, where the forest meets the grass. And we had found them. And we were preparing for a second bombardment. We had co-ordinates now, and we were going to fire *everything* we had left. We still had Hypersonics, a few Nukes, and several Thermobarics. We would wipe out their base. One problem. So did they.\n\nOur base was burned by Nuclear Fire. They did overshoot a bit, but that wound up hitting the Silos the hardest. Guy was obliterated while he was attending the Silos, and Mel died trying to recover supplies from the rapidly flooding and irradiated silo facility. After they respawned we were able to set up a crude silo and launch a single missile at the Gigantomachy, a nuclear missile that failed to destroy their facility, but killed two of their members and knocked out their silos. And with that we exhausted our battery supply, and our reactor was kind of burning. So neither of us could fire missiles, and we wound up getting into a final skirmish in the apocalyptic wastes.\n\nThe Kings of the Last Island moved to raid the ruins of their base, and we began to fire on them from an elevated position. Mel was outfitted with upgraded Power armour, but me and guy had to deal with only using Steel. We managed to knock out two of them before Porphyrion fired a Thermobaric missile at our position, using the short range rocket launcher that had eluded us. The Thermobaric knocked out Mel, but me and guy were able to kill Porphyrion, and destroy their beds using simple grenades before any of them could respawn. We raided their supplies, and returned to our base.\n\nHalf of it was underwater, two thirds were irradiated, and most of our tech was gone. But I guess we won. The Kings of the Last Island, rulers of a smoking radioactive crater, and a second, larger smoking radioactive crater that was also on fire.\n\nAnd that was it. We won, we'd managed to have the most stuff still intact by the end of the final session. Which this is. I don't know if the Overseer intended to end it here, but once the Gigantomachy fell there really wasn't much left to do, not much that would have been fun anyways. So concludes the final session, and thus the game\n\nRECAP\n=\n\nFriend tried to do a real version of the Closed Map Experiment, didn't succeed do to some questionable decisions regarding mod choice and map design, but it was an overall fun experience I felt like sharing.",

        "text": "So, I posted this a day or so ago at /r/CK2GameOfthrones and a person commented sayign it'd be worth it for me to post it here too. So without further ado, I present you the story of one Daemon Targaryen:\n\nIt all started during the period of the Rogue Prince's adventuring days.\nDaemon Targaryen was, along with his friend Colrys Velaryon, on war against the Three Sisters for the title of the Kingdom of Stepstones.\n\nThings were going okay. Daemon had taken his troops and dragon and sieged parts of the Steptsones. Effectively decimating large chunks of the enemies army and gaining some progress on the war.\n\nHowever the Prince felt something was off. During a talk with his firend and trusted confidant Colrys, Daemon realised that conquering the Stepstones would not help him achieve his dreams. He would be a king of his own, but still under his brother's shadow.\n\nThus Daemon decided to do somethin crazy. Something no other in recorded history had done. He set his aim on the Empire of Yi Ti.\n\nColrys thought him crazy and thus refrained from providing him with troops to fight. However, true and loyal to his friend he decided to keep the remaining forces of the Three Sisters at bay, so Daemon could at least settle somewhere close to his target and continue from there.\n\nAmbitious and cunning as he always was Daemon reached the conclusion that Leng's levies would be the key to winning the throne of Yi Ti.\n\nHe declared an adventurer's conquest on the northenmost part of the isle of Leng. The one with the most available troops.\n\nHis ships quickly covered the distance, his troops landing on Leng's capital. After three months of successfull sieging the capital using his soldiers and dragons he finally managed to capture the then God Empress of Leng.\n\nWith a new fief and close to twenty thousand troops, Daemon now had two choices:\n\nReach out to the ruler of the Three Sisters and wave a white flag, ending the ongoing war in the process on the cost of loosing face.\n\nOr, raise his ships and sail back to the narrow sea, finishing his conquest of the Stepstones.\n\nSeeing as the Stepstones were lands of little value compared to what lay next to him, the former rogue opted to declare a white peace. \nSurprisingly it worked.\n\nSo now all he had to do was conquer the remaining lands of Leng and some lands on Yi Ti's mainland so he could gain the opportunity to pledge fielty to the Yi Ti Emperor and overthrow him from the inside.\n\nBut to do that he needed enough prestige to break the recent truce his conquest had ended with. Thus begun the duels with prominent fighters around the world.\n\nIn the meantime Daemon was trying to sire a heir too. Sadly out of his four ladies -a wife and three conqubines- only his Lyseni conqubine liked him. Well, she practically adored the ground the man had been walking on. However the others disliked him.\n\nHis wife, the Bronze Bitch of Runestone, not so much as his Lengi conqubines, who apparently were sisters. But still, he had no luck visiting his legal wife's chambers. Well, not like he needed a heir from HER. But his heir having a claim on Runestone would be nice.\n\nIn less than a month Daemon had amassed the needed prestige. So he sent a delegation to the God Empress of Leng, declaring a Dragon Conquest against her.\n\nTwo months was all it took for his soldiers to re-siege her capital and capture enough family members of hers to enforce his demands. Daemon not only took her Kingdom, but all of her titles. Giving them to more loyal subjects of him, raising their opinion of their new King.\n\nIt took less than a month for the new God Emperor of Leng to gain land on Yi Ti's mainland. Declaring a Dragon Conquest on the south-eastern principality, its then ruler decided to bent the knee to the dragon riding King.\n\nLucky for Daemon his enemy's resignation happened after his brother donated gold to his cause. After the third war in a year Daemon came out with both land and gold.\n\nAnd thus, he pleged fielty to the Yi Ti Emperor.\n\nAlas, the Emperor died in a slave raid, leaving his pre-teen son to reing in his stead. Daemon liked the child, but what had to be done, had to be done.\n\nForming a faction he decided to depose the kid-Emperor. Seeing as he already contorlled two Kingdom tier titles, pulling all his forces on the capital of Xin wasn't hard to do. With around fourty or fifty thousand troops, Daemon marched towards the capital's gates. In a little while the kid-Emperor had been imprisoned.\n\nThe war was won. And now Daemon could either force the people to accept him as a title or let them willingly elect him as one.\n\nToo bored to deal with any more war and strife caused by acts of tyranny, Lord Protector Daemon of Yi Ti chose the second. He even converted to the local religion to support his campaing.\n\nHowever things seemed to favour a princess of the former rulling dynasty. So Daemon had her killed. And then had her sister killed. And her other sister and couple of brothers.\n\nHe only left the former kid-Emperor. Alive, but in his dungeons.\n\nHaving no other real potentional candidate the people chose to willingly accept Daemon as their one true Emperor and God.\n\nDaemon's first rulling act was to release the kid-Emperor and allow him to live close to his former court, enjoying the lifestyle he had grown accoustomed to.\n\nHe also gave some lands to Westerosi courtiers who had followed him. They had never seemed to like him much, but making them lords seemed to improve their opinion of him.\n\nIt was a couple of weeks into his reign that his new steward informed him of the name choosing ceremony. Daemon now had to choose among a select variety of epithets for his divine dynasty to carry.\n\nHis options varried. Carmine, Red Ruby, Fire Opal, Jet, Onyx , Ash Grey and Dragon. Those were the ones that fascinated him the most. After a lot of thought, he took on the epither Fire Opal, in honour to both his dragon and the High Valyrians of the old days.",

        "text": "Yesterday (At the beginning of writing this), I went through 2 characters in one session, we played dark souls in pathfinder, and then everybody else went on a drug and crime spree.\n\nLet’s start with some background information. We’re playing an interdimensional campaign where players can play any genre of character. We use these techno-magical badges that let us teleport between dimensions. My character, Hope is a half-angel Paladin from “Heaven” that tanks pretty well and hits really hard (She recently dealt &gt; 160 hp damage on a crit). She is a king of most of a continent on the dimension we started in, and is seiging a nearby city. Morrigan is a chaotic evil tengu witch that does a lot of debuff things. She’s from a modern earth-like world that magical creatures from different dimensions keep getting to and has recently experienced a zombie apocalypse. And the human, Darentien, is a mild-mannered oracle healer from a religious fantasy world that demons took over. That is all the players that were available at the start of the session. There were also two dmpcs available, Lucas, a human rogue (spy?) that is op to the max, and Einkel Megatorque, some kind of engineering halfling that runs around in an op star wars battle droid based mech suit. Only Lucas was with us at the start.\n\nOn this fantasy dimension with early guns, but mostly swords and magic, we were chasing down a mohrg, an undead creature that can spawn more mohrgs and zombies from dead things. We started at it’s recently opened tomb where a bunch of psychopomps had died and went into it, found some magic weapons, a hidden tunnel, that was collapsed at one end, and a nearly dead person that hope revived that was bespelled by the mohrg to collapse the tunnel behind it. We figure that the mohrg is heading to the nearby city in order to collect zombie followers. We go there. They tell us that everything’s good. We go back. Can’t find the trail of the mohrg. We ask for Einkel’s help getting through the tunnel, but he’s too busy. We ask if he’s fighting a world ending undead abomination and he says yes. We teleport to him and he’s fighting a different world ending undead abomination in the zombie apocalypse dimension. We dispatch that flaming green giant guy easily. We ask Einkel for his help again, and we dig out the tunnel in the tomb. It leads over just a little ways. We finally find the mohrgs trail and follow it. DM says there are signs of a big battle and now there’s a bigger trail to follow. We go further, another battle, bigger trail. And again. Then we see the horde. It’s pretty big.\n\nWe start the battle with Hope, the idiot she (I) is, runs right into the middle of the horde of zombies and then channel positive energy’s the lot of them. She deals a little damage to all the undead creatures. Then they smack her a lot. Everybody else does something insignificant,then Hope heals herself a little, and channels positive energy against everything bad in the world. Einkel shows up. Then the zombie horde smacks Hope to death just after the morhg paralyzes her for 4 minutes. Einkel blasts everything with a laser explosion. Other players go and do minor things. Einkel gets paralyzed. Everybody decides to teleport out. Darentien teleports Einkel (sans mech) out. Morrigan teleports out with a thinaun manacle containing Hope’s soul, one of Hope’s magic items, and one of Hope’s thumbs she had bit off.\n\nThen we ordered pizza and there was a snacks run. We discussed what to do next, what we wanted to play. Still DnD. What I should play. I had a backup character. His name was Tor Grey Evestrom. DM’s trying to remember anything about this character I had brought up. This is the description of his world (it takes up the next paragraph if you want to skip it).\n\nTor Grey Evestrom, otherwise known as Edgy McEdgeface. Comes from a world where fantasy races live in a gritty capitalist monarchical sci-fi setting and dinosaurs roam the land. Lizardfolk use magic and dinos to terrorize the mammalian races. The majority of races live in a futuristic society and use technology and science for their purposes, and see magic as crude and barbaric. Tor's parents were minor nobles in a border kingdom that was invaded by lizardfolk, and his parents, 13 siblings, and favorite goth metal band all died in the invasion in life altering cinematic moments. Afterwards he became the foster child to a cruel family purely for the purpose of bettering their publicity. When he grew up, he took work as a soldier, trying to get revenge on the lizardman, Qroatztoxyix, who killed his father. In his first encounter with the man, 6 years later, he was left without any legs or arms. He used the vast majority of his family's fortune in order to create mechanical ones. Since then he's used his skills at war working as a mercenary and a hitman, learning the skills of an assassin from the greatest one anyone has ever known (until he \"died\" in Tor's latest attempt at revenge). Basically Edgy McEdgeface, the elven rogue gunslinger hybrid.\n\nSo the surviving players decide to try and get Tor to join the party right away. They decide to randomly teleport to a dimension they’ve never been to. They arrive in the starwars universe, buy some deathsticks and an alcoholic drink, then teleport away into another random dimension. Which just so happened to be the dimension that my character lives in, and they happen to just pop into existence. How did that happen? How should I know? I don’t know. Don’t ask me how. Anyway, they teleport in right next to Tor. Tor’s asks: “What was that? Was that magic?”\nOther players lie. They say it wasn’t magic. My Sense Motive, Bluff and Perception centric character rolls Sense Motive and figures out that it’s magic. “Why are a human and a crow person using magic? I mean the lizardfolk use magic, not crow people, and certainly not humans! Where did you come from?”\nOther players lie. They say they’re from around. Tor rolls Sense Motive and figures out that they’re not from around. “So you’re not from around here? You’re from what, another world?”\nOther players lie. They say they’re from another world. Tor …. You know what? You get the gist. “So you’re not from another world? What are you from another plane?”\nAnd then “So you’re from another, what? Existence?”\nOther players dance around the issue. I say okay, just let’s get you out of the open. I take them to a bar. All of a sudden one of the other players is like “I teleport them (Me and the other player) to another dimension.”\n\nNow this is a reeeeally bad thing for my character. Essentially he experiences incomprehensible agony of both mental and physical kind. Time stretches out for him. In the instant it takes for all of them to teleport to another dimension, I experience a year of nothing but absolute insanity and personal destruction. When the teleport ends, Tor comes out of it yelling at the top of his lungs “...UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCK”\nI loudly complain at my companions and take a look around. There’s a castle in the distance and we’re next to this arch thing with a desiccated human looking thing circling it. We talk about where to go for an unnecessary amount of time. Then we approach the guy that’s circling the archway and he starts attacking us. We back up a bit and try to talk to him, but he’s not having it. So we smush him good.\n\nSomething about how the battle worked felt a little weird though and when the DM said to the person that killed it “You feel the number 2200. You got 2200 something.” We (the players, and also the bird person, who had heard of darksouls from the modern world that she lived in for a long time) immediately associated it with Dark Souls. We walked through the arch and all of a sudden we’re in a broken down cathedral and there’s a big dude in the centre of it. What’s more, a fog door closes behind us. Tor tries to figure out if the guy is hostile, and gets a vague sense of hostility from him, so he shoots him. Boom roll initiative. This was actually a really fun battle. The baddy had a sword and a big backswing that lasted a round. We rolled out of the way with acrobatics, and it struck air. We keep hitting it, and it finally falls over and dissipates. We all get 9000 something souls and a bonfire appears in front of the altar in the centre back of the church. We struggle to light it for a little while before someone just touches the sword thing sticking out of the pile of ashen bones and it immediately lights up. We spend our souls and get a bonus to our Ability Scores. Then they decide to go back and my character goes “Nooooooooooo!!....” And experiences another year of ultimate agony before appearing at the party’s base of operations.\n\nLucas is there and asks who my character is. He say his name is Tor. Tor is not happy. Tor explains what happened and Lucas asks why I wasn’t given a badge, which would have prevented Tor having to endure indescribable and unending agony. Twice. Morrigan and Darentien apologize and ask me to join them. At this point, out of character, I tell the other players and the DM that I don’t think Tor would join this group. Everybody gets a chuckle and agrees. Tor asks what’s in it for him to join the group. He gets a few promises of letting him protect the universe, which doesn’t phase him. Then they promise money, and his ears perk up a little. He says he’ll join them, temporarily at least. And they give him a badge so that he won’t experience an existence of pure annihilation again.\n\nAt this point, another (new) player comes in and says that she wants to play a teenager that believes he’s a vampire. So we do the whole pretending to randomly teleport to their existence thing that they did for Tor, and arrive in an earth like world right in the middle of Los Angeles. First thing Morrigan (the crow person) does is try to steal a car without disable device trained. Car blares a few times. I pull out my thieves tools and disable the sounds, cause tech ain’t no big thing. She tries to hotwire the car and she succeeds, but the car blares again. Tor sighs and pulls out his thieves tools again. The next thing we do is go and try to buy gas at a gas station. Morrigan tells Darentien to fill up the gas tank and the first thing that he does is pull the trigger and spray gasoline everywhere. You know. He’s not from around here. When Tor notices this, he just says “Fucktard!” (Even I was astounded that I said it. I don’t like retard used as a slur, and I don’t swear.) And teleports back home. I (out of character) just say that Tor’s done. He’s not up to getting killed with these two nitwits.\n\nSo that’s the end of my participation that night. But the story must go on. We still need to introduce this vampire person. We still need to know what the “Interdimensional Drugs and Crime Spree” part of the title is all about. So, to begin, we start where we left off. Gasoline spilling out a gas pump and a crow person trying to pay for gas. So, nothing actually catches fire, despite the pure hatred that the multi-multiverse has for us. The real problem is that the cashier doesn’t want a crow person thing inside the store, and that that crow person thing is trying to buy gasoline and a cell phone with what looks suspiciously like ¼ ounce gold coins. So Morrigan asks to exchange some cash for her gold coins. The cashier doesn’t have enough money in his till to pay that and refuses to go to the safe in the back and leave the store unattended with a suspicious crow person in it. Eventually, Morrigan just puts the guy to sleep and grabs some change from the till.\n\nAs they leave the gas station they hear car sirens. The police are quickly evaded, but Darentien asks why Morrigan attacked somebody, not knowing what the police are. Morrigan dismisses the police as bandits. Shortly thereafter something happens (at the point of writing this part of the story it’s been about two weeks since the recorded incidents, so I can’t recall everything perfectly.) and the car needs to be ditched. Morrigan and Darentien decide to duck into an alleyway. They happen to run into the aforementioned wannabe vampire named “Vassago” I think? For some unknown reason they come to the conclusion that the weird pale oddball espousing the values of darkness and blood is a trustworthy and valuable companion, and decide to go on a road trip with him and his thirteen useless followers to fucking New Orleans, cause, you know, someone rolled on a table and it happens to almost be Mardi Gras. So they go down the alley and find a big white panelled van to pour everybody into. They don’t even need to break into it, it’s unlocked. There’s already a screwdriver instead of a key in the ignition, so you know that’s legitimate. They peel out of the alley and drive up to a grocery store for food and drinks on the long trip ahead of them. Darentien buys seven pounds of beef jerky. The stoner wannabe vampire army goes around breaking shit and generally causing unease and discomfort. Morrigan buys the kind of jug of water that water coolers use. I can’t remember if they pay, but I do remember that as they leave more cops show up and Morrigan has to sleep them.\n\nSo they start on the path to New Orleans and decide that at some point, they’re going to need to exchange gold for cash. They travel for a few hours and drop in on a pawn shop in some city that I can’t remember. They ask straight up for money for gold. The pawn shop owner offers not nearly enough money for the gold. The pawnshop owner gets sleeped. The pawnshop gets looted for a bunch of terrible katanas, one good katana, a bunch of cash (for a reasonable amount of gold) and Darentien gets dominated by the new player into stealing some meth or coke or something. A silent alarm apparently had gone off, and Morrigan, while in the back noticed so. Darentien notices that there’s a cctv system recording them, but nobody cares. Morrigan hears sirens in the distance and tries to corral the gang of teenage stoner vampire followers out of the store, but faced against their absolute indifference her words find no purchase. That is, she isn’t listened to until she offers up “Star Wars drugs” to anyone that got into the van. Everyone piled in and they started driving off. They had to fight off the police for a bit, but managed to get away without too much effort.\n\nThey get a little further until the teenagers demanded their promised sci-fi drugs. Deathsticks were procured from a pocket somewhere, and ignited. Now, for those of you that don’t know, the name “Deathsticks” isn’t an exaggeration. About 4 teenagers drop dead right there. Morrigan, who’s been driving this whole time gets a good second hand dose, loses contact with reality and flips the car. Now, you’ll have to remember that not only is the van jam packed with bodies alive and dead, but there’s about 6 or 7 craptanas in the back. So the car flip ends with a lot of dead teenagers. Morrigan, Darentien, and Vassago, whose near death experiences have snapped them back to reality scramble out of the car. They open a door and sort through the dead and dying teenagers. They pull anything out that’s still breathing and tend to them a little. As they’re still in the city, they attract some passersby who initially want to lend aide. The first person that stops is an old man with a truck with a bed filled with various plants. Vassago kills him to form a spawn and initially we think that he becomes a new vampire almost instantly until I point out that vampires don’t spawn until 1d4 days after death. Well, the other bystanders start clearing out at this point. I think Morrigan sleeps a few of them. Eventually, they pile all the not yet dead teenagers into the old man’s truck and drive off.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for a police escort to appear and they start a short chase fight scene where Darentien stabs tires out with a floating sword. All of a sudden, the wheels on the truck go flat and Morrigan can’t steer anymore. Apparently the police placed a spike strip down at some point. The second car crashes and police start closing in. Morrigan tells Vassago that she can get him out of there, but they’re going to have to leave the few remaining teenagers behind. Vassago doesn’t care and Morrigan, still dominated Darentien, and Vassago teleport to a random point somewhere on this planet. They teleport many many times, and I can’t remember half of them. These are the ones I remember. London, Latin america somewhere, one of the polar caps, just over a point in the middle of the ocean, thousands of feet in the air, some place where the air pressure is uncomfortably high. As they teleported more, they arrived at worse destinations. When they got to the place where the air pressure was weirdly high they decided to teleport instead back to Los Angeles, which they could reliably teleport back to. Everybody laughs at the fact that they went all the way back to where they started the trip in Los Angeles. Then, after catching wind of some news of several teenagers having been arrested in connection to a violent drug cult, they randomly decided to teleport to the party’s demi-plane headquarters and induct the vampire intot the party. And we called it a session.\n\nI have never been party to such a sidetracked series of chaos and destruction inducing events. Honestly that was probably the most insane a game of DnD will ever be for me.",

My character is a Tal-Vashoth pirate captain, meaning he's a really tall, muscular, horned motherfucker who wrecks shit. His \"piracy\" is really mostly him fighting and killing bad dudes though. He doesn't fuck around with merchants, he mostly disrupts the slave trade and harasses the militant society he used to belong to, the Qunari. Aside from that, he's basically muscle/transport-for-hire.  \n  \nOur party's main quest has been dealing with a cabal of evil wizards who are raiding ancient elven tombs to try and discover the secret to immortality. In stopping them, we've actually discovered a few ancient elves trapped in magical sleep, and we've had to bring them with us to keep the Vints (our enemies) away from them.  \n  \nNot too long ago, our group discovered that some nobles in the city that we're headquartered in were funding the Vints' expeditions. We went to interrogate the noble providing the most cash, and found one of the Magisters (very powerful commander wizards among the Vints) in a meeting with him. I wind up scaling the wall of the mansion and busting in through the second story window to assault the Magister. He gets away by doing some crazy magic where he melts through the floor like the fuckin' Secret Life of Alex Mack or some shit, so we wind up interrogating the noble, kidnapping him, bringing him back to our ship, interrogating and torturing him some more, then cutting him up into pieces and throwing them into the sea (I swear we're the good guys in this).  \n  \nWe go on another adventure to an elven ruin, fight more Vints, kill another giant monster, and return to our Inn at the city, a place called \"The Royal Cheese Wheel\" run by a dwarf named \"Jethro\". There are some city guards waiting for us when we get back. They tell us that the Magister has accused us of kidnapping and killing the noble. Which, you know, we did.  \n  \n&gt; Me: It ain't true, mate.  \n&gt; Guard: Well he's been missing for some time.  \n&gt; Me: I been out at sea. Just got back. Why would I kill a noble? I'm a pirate.  \n&gt; Guard: And you freely admit that?  \n&gt; Me: Aye. I don't do any piracy within the borders of your city. The thing about bein' a pirate is, you commit crimes at sea. I don't do land crimes, so I didn't kill yer noble.  \n&gt; Guard: Well his body was found chopped up into pieces-\n&gt; Me: Oh, what a terrible fate! 'Tis a shame when such befalls a man!  \n&gt; Guard: The pieces were found washed up on the shore.  \n&gt; Me: Well, why didn't ya say so!? I can see why, the body bein' found by the sea, an' me bein' the type who commits crimes at sea, ye'd think it's one o' my sea crimes! It makes perfect sense!  \n&gt; Guard: Exactly. So-  \n&gt; Me: Be that as it may, I didn't do it. I mean, look at me. Broken horn, peg leg. Big an' hobbled as I am, do ye really think I could kidnap a man from Hightown and run through the streets without drawin' attention?  \n  \nAnd this point the guard captain is exasperated and just doesn't want to deal with this anymore. He asks me to just come down to the guard station so he can record my statement. I agree to this and my party members trail me from behind. When we get there, the Magister's waiting for me. When he realizes that I'm not being arrested, he gets in a big fuss about it. My character remains cordial and respectful to all the guards, so he gets all huffy and leaves. As he passes, he whispers some smug remark to me about how as long as I'm here, that's good enough for him.  \n  \nMy party trails him back to the inn, where he uses blood magic to attack Jethro and try to kidnap the ancient elves we've got with us. Knowing he's up to something, my character finishes making his statement and then, to \"thank ye all for yer hard work and kindness towards a fella what wouldn't usually be receivin' such fair treatment\", invites them to the inn to be treated for a round of drinks.  \n  \nThe guards and I walk in on this dude using blood magic, which is illegal, and I leap over the bar, tackle him, and the guards arrest him. So the bad guy tries to get me thrown in jail for a murder I actually committed, and I get him arrested instead. A few sessions later, I get a letter of commendation from the city guard thanking me for my service. So my character is now an innocent pirate AND an honorable citizen.",

        "text": "Onget could have wept tears of joy when his pick finally broke into the caverns, he had been digging for months in search of them so it was an emotional moment when he felt the hard iron head strike through the wall and break into space, crumbling the gabbro wall inwards into the cave. Distantvault was two years old at this point, and the nobles had begun to put a lot of pressure on the miners to get into the caves, eager to get their soft hands on new jewels and precious metals. And they found all that and more. The cavern walls were pockmarked with every jewel imaginable: emerald, chrysoprase, zircon, quartzes of all sizes and hues; the floor was covered in a dense moss, harbouring edible plants and useful shrubs such that they would never have to risk eking out a living on the sparse clay above ground; and the animals were plentiful and meek, dralthas many times larger than the tallest among the dwarves roamed placidly and smaller elk birds danced and darted around their feet. It was truly all they had held out hope for.\n\nBut that was not all they found.\n\nOnget first noticed something was wrong a few months later when he went down into the caverns to collect some plump helmets for the brewery, but something made him pause once he had taken a few steps onto the soft fungus coating the cave's floor. He just felt like something was... different. He strained his ears to hear any sign that something was amiss, any indicator that something wasn't right in this underground paradise when he realised that he was actually *trying* to hear something. It was so unnatural to not be hearing the elk birds squawking in the distance; the dralthas grunting as they were led around the pastures; or the constant hubbub of noise from dwarves mining, farming and chopping. In place of all that there was an alien silence that hung heavy in air like a poison, dense and smothering, so much so that Onget cleared his throat just to make some noise and break the spell, but winced as the sound echoed across the myriad of walls and tunnels, seeming to rise to an abnormal crescendo before being lost the shadows deeper into the earth.\n\nOnget took a deep breath to clear his head and carry on when he heard an answer to his awkward siren: a plaintive squeak emanating weakly from a tunnel off to the left of the large chamber he was in. Now thoroughly unnerved, he drew his axe and proceeded to investigate. Upon turning the corner, the miner stumbled upon an injured elk bird - or what was left of one. The creature wasn't long for this world; it had had its belly ripped out and was bleating hopelessly into the void as guts seeped into the floor around it. The gash on its underside was long and looked more like a tear, as if something had pulled it apart and dumped it rather than hunted it. It was still cawing feebly and it felt too... exposed to have this noise in the eerie silence, so Onget slit its throat then stood to consider the situation he was in. On the one hand he did feel very much like something was wrong and he should alert the rest of the fort; but on the other hand it was just a feeling, he had no real evidence anything was amiss. He then thought that whatever had done this to the elk bird clearly hadn't done it long ago and could still be around, so he slung the carcass over his shoulder and headed for the exit.\n\nAnd it watched him leave.\n\n-----\n\n\"Alath's cavern party are still down there?\" asked the administrator Vabok.\n\n\"Aye, and I didn't see them on my trip down for some fungiwood either\" replied Ducim, the fort's foremost pioneer, a grizzled veteran of Distantvault and as deadly with his steely gaze as he was with his newly-named steel spear, 'Spinebolt'.\n\nThe administrator grunted, \"Fucking layabouts, knew they weren't going to get anything done, they just want to eat, drink and sleep all day. It wouldn't surprise me if the pricks were in the corner of The Sweet Loaf right now, getting wasted on all our rum and wine\".\n\nDucim said nothing but turned on the spot and walked out the of clerk's office.\n\n-----\n\nIt had been a week since Alath's party were last seen heading down to the caverns to collect plants, and now a search party was being put together to send down there and find them. Onget watched them leave, the concern obvious in his face when he went to see Vabok later to talk about his misgivings and his experience a few days ago.\n\n\"But the caverns have had nothing but harmless creatures in there since we found them, and we know what Alath and his ilk are like, don't worry about it\", came the reply, dismissing the miner's feelings of dread with a wave of his hand.\n\nSo with that Onget left unfulfilled, walking down the main tunnel with a cloud of uncertainty over his head, lost in thought until a curious sound roused him from his reflection. It rose from the shaft leading to the caverns and rebounded across the walls, over and over again. It was wordless, bloodcurdling scream; a shriek agonisingly ripped from the lungs of its creator. It echoed over and over and over, then abruptly ceased. Onget felt as if his blood was frozen and was almost entirely paralysed in terror, and when he finally managed to come to his senses and look around, he saw the ashen faces of the other citizens in the tunnel; faces of muted horror and fear.\n\nBut before anyone could process the proper actions, there came another noise from the shaft: a wet, flapping noise; a gurgling, hissing roar that was only getting louder until it seemed to have raised to such an intensity that it was coming from inside the listener. Which obviously wasn't true.\n\nNot yet anyway.\n\n-----\n\nIt emerged from the stairwell maybe 50 feet in front of Onget and he felt his insides turn to liquid just looking at it. It was a titanic leech, its sleek black body covered in scales and oozing a noxious slime, but it wasn't slithering around, it hauled itself up and out of the cramped mineshaft with a horde of spiny, bulbous legs that erupted out of the underside of its body, and it was aided by a set of wings on its top, skinless and bloody, constantly spreading and clawing at the ceiling, screeching as they scraped the rough stone. And its mouth, Onget thought, Oh gods its mouth! It was eyeless, and the front of its body just seemed to end, shorn off and ragged, forming a horrifying, tooth-filled maw that was several times bigger than any of the dwarves. It finally heaved itself up onto the tunnel flooring and stood for a moment, taking in the situation. Then it charged straight down the tunnel at Onget.\n\nHe stood for an eternal second, unable to do anything except watch as the abomination closed in on him. It picked up the weaver Dumat in its jaws and ripped him in half, letting his torso drop to the floor; it cleaved an entire swathe of farmers running out of the field rooms in one sweep of a wing, half-scything, half-crushing them against the outer walls of their workshop. Onget turned and ran. He ran as fast as he could directly away from the beast, which happened to be towards the main entryway, taking him past the temple and tavern, with the latter ejecting all its drunken, disorientated patrons out into the path of the monster.\n\nThe creature slowed slightly when confronted with so many victims, and took a few seconds to shoot a disgusting tendril from its mouth 10 feet downwards, latching onto the nearest dwarf by the back. It shuddered for a moment with apparent effort, and with a terrifying sucking noise it drained the hapless dwarf of blood completely in three seconds, turning her to a husk in as short a timespan. But by this time the militia had arrived, and 16 dwarves bristling with weapons formed up in two ranks and marched quickly down the corridor, breaking rank slightly when they hit the mass of civilians coming the opposite way. \n\nThe beast saw this however, and became enraged, loosing a low, rumbling roar so mighty Onget felt like his ears would burst. It drew its disgusting body up to the height of the tunnel, still stooped, and jerked its toothy maw forwards, spewing out a thick white substance which quickly coated everything; the walls, the floor and all the occupants of the hallway. From where Onget was standing, towards the back, the substance reached his legs, covering them from the thigh down and quickly solidifying into a thick gunk that was impossible to get free from. Onget watched as the monster carved a path towards him, devouring his friends and family in mere seconds, lurching its way inexorably to him. He struggled to free his legs from the substance as the beast impaled a stonecrafter with a long leg, now only 10 feet from him, he could smell its stench: an odour of rotting flesh mixed with bile and excrement, sickly-sweet and vile. He gagged and fell over, his back to the floor as the titan loomed over him now, stretching its mouth even wider as it bore down upon him. Onget braced himself for his final moments.\n\nBut they never came.\n\nInstead he heard a soft grunt and wet sounding strike. Onget opened his eyes and to his astonishment he looked upon Ducim the ranger, gouging Spinebolt through the beast's lower jaw. He didn't wait for a reaction however, and quickly ripped out the spear and leapt back, just in time to dodge the leech's front legs sweeping out into the space where he had just been. The stoic dwarf shifted his grip to an overhand hold and pushed off his feet surprisingly fast, sliding his weapon roughly into the joint above his enemy's front right leg, making it go limp and useless instantly. This didn't seem to slow down the beast however, as - now in a greater rage - it swung its entire front body at the small assailant, knocking him to the ground heavily. The monstrosity wasted no time in covering the dwarf in more of the viscous webbing, leaving him bound tightly to the floor on his back, only his face and torso uncovered.\n\nOnget could see Ducim struggle against his organic bindings, looking up at the creature as it approached at a leisurely pace, knowing it had its prey under control. The beast paused above the ranger and, opening its maw, extended its horrifying tendril towards the immobile dwarf. When the slimy, quivering tentacle was inches from Ducim's face, Onget noticed something strange: the ranger was *smiling*.\n\nThen with a primal roar ten times louder than the ancient animal, Ducim ripped his entire right arm out of the webbing and in one motion gripped the tendril with a leather-bound fist. The beast recoiled slightly but the dwarf was possessed; he had transformed from a quiet hunter into the embodiment of dwarven rage; powered by Armok and an ancient vigour, he yanked the serpentine appendage hard, pulling the entire beast downwards to him. Onget couldn't believe his eyes, he was seeing this unspeakable horror helpless in the unwavering grasp of his former prey. Gritting his teeth, Ducim started to wrap the tongue around his fist, winching the monster relentlessly towards him. The beast struggled in vain to break his grip, but it was terrified of the dwarf, and rightly so. When the humongous leech was but inches from Ducim's face - and it was bracing its entire body against him, heaving and straining to no avail - he filled the cavernous hallway with a roar, \"BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!\" and drew out Spinebolt from its hidden recess underneath him, driving the tip with unrivalled ferocity through roof of the creature's mouth and straight out the top of its head.\n\nThe beast let out a piercing, pitiful wail, shaking and trembling all over in its death throes, and fell over slowly to the side, coming to rest leaning against the wall of the tunnel. It shuddered once and lay still. Slain.\n\nDucim stood up, wiped the last of the filthy web from his tunic and strapped his weapon to his upper body. He turned over to look at Onget, and seeing he was still trapped he strode over to assist him. Onget was stupefied, rendered unable to speak, just watching as Ducim cut him loose with a dagger and walked around helping people up and recovering the wounded.\n\nThey buried 80 citizens that day.\n\n-----\n\nThere was once an ancient, unspeakable horror, an abomination so aged and abhorred its very name was lost to the march of time. It had remained in wait, seeking only to destroy and inflict suffering on everything it encountered.\n\nBut it was no match for one slave to Armok.",

        "text": "Our actors for this evening:  \n***Jimmy DeWitt***, the mercenary. A British veteran of the Great War, DeWitt has used his knack for killing to become a hired gun that takes jobs across the world. Played by DJ.  \n***Vincent Yorke***, the artist. A bohemian by choice, Yorke made his first great art portraying the battered and broken veterans returning from the Western Front after the Great War. Played by Riley.  \n***J.G. Wilder***, the anthropologist. With a face that has plastered National Geographic and extensive trophies from global expeditions and hunts, J.G. now faces his most dangerous quarry.  \n***Sally Sutterfield***, the fiance. Bethrothed to J.G. Wilder after a rather long period of courtship, Sally has put up with her beloved’s burning desire for adventure and tags along when she can.  \n***Harris Hale***, the loner. Living alone in the abandoned abbey for nearly two decades. The isolation is starting to numb the senses and distance him from reality.  \n***Sewn-Eyed-Man***, the outcast. A rather grotesque tribal savage from the darkest corners of the African jungles, this is the only man who has gone against the White Lion and lived.  \n***The Ship’s Crew***, background. The dozen or so that run J.G. riverboat for this expedition deep into the African interior. Superstitious but paid well.  \n***The White Lion***, the abomination. An albino terror that stalks the tall grass, said to be a demon with the power to kill men with a gaze. Many have tried to kill it. All have failed.\n***\nThe year is 1919. Jimmy DeWitt of London received the summons from a courier boy. His step-brother J.G. Wilder was mounting an expedition into the African interior and extended his hand as a sign of good faith to DeWitt, whose mother had married J.G.’s father. The two had rarely spent time together, divided by the Atlantic ocean, and J.G. wished to change that. Vincent Yorke painted from a small flophouse in Providence Rhode Island, and was invited personally by Wilder. The anthropologist had already purchased many works from the starving artist, and hoped that he could be brought along to paint the aftermath of his successful hunt. Yorke also saw the valid chance to paint a magnum opus of the African wilderness with its dark secrets and hidden beauties.\n\nAfter travelling by various means, the group came together in South Africa. Wilder’s personal riverboat, Sally’s Delight, was being loaded up be the stevedores and other crewmembers. Vincent brought with him a stylish wardrobe from the latest Parisian fashions, and his bicycle. DeWitt brought his rugged Ford truck, a hunting rifle, a modified pistol, and a few ‘special’ bullets for a rainy day. The stern of the ship was loaded with supplies all stacked in and around the mercenary’s truck, with the bicycle perched perfectly up top. After everything was ensured to be properly restrained the cruise was on its way. That first night J.G. called them all to the dining room for a meeting and discussion. He thanked the two for joining him and explained his reasoning. The mythical White Lion, the terror of the region, had become an obsession for him. This last great obstacle to overcome before proving his dominance over nature. It was a massive beast with a fiendish intelligence about it, and nobody had yet bested it. But J.G. had an ace up his sleeve, and let his brother and friend in on it. He had discovered, through various contacts and previous trips into the area, that there was a local man who had fought the White Lion. He survived and was shunned by the tribe, tortured and kicked out from the village. For witnessing the demon and living his eyes were sewn shut. But he was wise beyond his years, and a rich resource to track this monster. The boat was to travel up the river three days and dock, J.G. would travel into the interior to make deals with the locals and have the Sewn Eyed Man turned over to him as an indentured guide. From there they’d head to the base camp.\n\nDuring those first three days the crew was amiable, going about their business and not bothering the expedition guests. Vincent managed to win a rather tidy sum from the crew, DeWitt, and Wilder in a late-night card game. A ferocious rainstorm battered the ship, and the gang helped the crew batten down the hatches. Much sight-seeing was also done as well, Vincent had a field day sketching the astounding degree of flora and fauna to be found in the wilds. The two brothers made some time to bond, sitting around during dinner and discussing their lives before. DeWitt shared stories of gas attacks in the Great War with his travelling companions, and Vincent talked about his best pieces of art.\n\nVincent and DeWitt agreed to travel with J.G. and Sally to meet with the village elders. DeWitt wanted to bring his truck, but the anthropologist wanted to keep the technological marvelling to a minimum as it might distract the important ‘business’ meeting. The gang headed in on foot, though DeWitt took his pistol with him just in case. The people of the village were in a sorry state, currently dealing with a malignant illness that had spread like wildfire. J.G. slipped away into the headman’s tent as Sally met with some children she had taught on a previous trip. DeWitt sat down and started to clean out his rifle as a show of force, and VIncent sketched some of the locals for his journal. But one of them, an elderly woman that seemed centuries old, was enamored with the portrait he sketched of her. In more action than words she demanded to keep it, tugging at the page and getting rather heated. Her dry wrinkled skin seemed to grind and shed apart as she shouted and struggled with the artist. This commotion drew in DeWitt and Wilder, who both diffused the situation by giving the woman the picture. Vincent was not happy.\n\nJ.G. took the two men to collect the Sewn Eyed Man. The name did not disappoint. Living alone in a decrepit hut outside of the village, the bald and wrinkled man seemed to be a lump of dried leather. His eyes were restrained by very poor work and he muttered about to the men, in a rather esoteric dialect only J.G. seemed to understand. They collected him and all marched back to the ship. The anthropologist gave the ancient man a wicker rocking chair, and that’s where he stayed for the rest of the river cruise.\n\nAnother day of travelling brought on more tension with the crew. It was here the river became more narrow. Fronds and vines brushed up against the hull and there seemed to be eyes everywhere. There were no other stops set by European companies that traded goods, ivory, and the like. The natives here were restless and unforgiving of the European invaders. Paranoia and tensions ran high as the day went on, but they reached the small sheltered beach without any delay or complication. The crew set out boarding planks and began offsetting the expedition’s supplies. DeWitt mounted his truck and Vincent hopped inside as well. J.G. and the crew members set about on the jungle with their machetes, carving the path wider as they headed towards the strange leaning structure that loomed above the river. The Sewn Eyed Man remained in his rocking chair until the way was clear and the camp was near.\nAs they neared the ruins of Three Maries Abbey a shrill cry went out. DeWitt stopped his truck and expected some sort of tribal attack. But they were instead met by a small leaping man dressed in extremely stained and well-worn khaki. Frizzled gray hair, wild and crazy eyes, somewhat rotting teeth. This was their host, Harris Hale. The man was happy to greet some newcomers to the area, and seemed a big fan of J.G. Wilder. DeWitt and Vincent spent some time talking to him as the boat’s crew assembled the tents, eating area, and waste facilities. When all was said and done the crew returned to Sally’s Delight, where they’d stay for the week. DeWitt started a fire and the gang cooked up meat that had been hunted during the river trek up here.\n\nThe gang spent the first day running around and getting stock of the terrain around the old abbey. It had been constructed over a hundred years ago by missionaries attemping to help convert the area. Harris had moved here about twenty years ago and had become the self-entitled groundskeeper. He wasn’t doing a very good job of it, the whole sight covered in overgrowth. He had spent his time keeping the three stained-glass windows in good shape, as well as all the statuary around the courtyard. VIncent sketched these as well, and wandered into the brush to find something worth drawing. DeWitt and J.G. broke out the maps. A ten mile radius around the abbey marked the frequently used hunting spots and sightings of the White Lion. The two brothers started marking their chosen ambush sites as Vincent stumbled upon a grotesque little icon. He wasn’t even sure how it came about into his hands, but the charm and mystery of it was more than enough for him to keep it. The Sewn Eyed Man continued rocking in his chair. \n\nThe next day rolled around. Vincent managed to wake feeling extremely well-rested even though he had never been forced into an environment such as this. The gang loaded up into DeWitt’s truck and headed out to the first of the sites they wanted to look at. It was near the edge of the radius, after the thick brush had given way to the shifting tall grass of the plains. The man started to scatter about and examine the terrain for a good place to lay a trap. Vincent wandered away again, following the sound of birds and the rising across the horizon. As he stumbled across the hills and dips he came to rest at a large shady tree. DeWitt circled around the watering hole and started to poke around inside a large cave that made up the mouth of hole. Triggering his flashlight, he splashed through the shallow water. Meanwhile Vincent got closer and realized that a large section of the tree’s trunk was dedicated to strange carvings all across the bark that were sinisterly accurate to the one on the small token he held.\n\nInside the moist cave DeWitt found dead grass and signs of feces. He shouted back to his brother to come check things out when Vincent stumbled back around as well, disoriented from the tall grass and the strange faces that had peered at him from the tree. Both heard DeWitt’s shouts and rain in to help. Vincent slipped on the wet stone and bruised his knees badly, struggling to get up with J.G.’s help. All present could now examine the den now, and J.G. agreed that this had to be the lion’s den. With the area found they began to set out the traps. The two brothers agreed to set it away from the den, as a beast cornered inside the cave would be an insurmountable threat. DeWitt placed a bear trap to help entrap the creature and placed some of the leftover meat. Vincent trudged off to start painting the landscape for J.G.’s victory portrait. J.G. and DeWitt waited in the brush and made small talk. Some birds chirped. A stick cracked. The sun lazily trawled across the cloudless sky. DeWitt found a lion’s tooth in the grass and started fashioning a necklace from it.\n\nThen death.\n\nVincent was thrown back against a hard rock, a hard crack against the unyielding surface as his world exploded. DeWitt had a round chambered before the White Lion cleaved his step-brother in two, a spray of gore dousing the mercenary. The gun barked and the Lion was hit. But it toppled DeWitt over. A second of time had seemed to pass as Vincent rolled free from the ground, blood caked across his face. He screamed to DeWitt to get him’ J.G.’s gun, but the mercenary was absolutely paralyzed by recent events.\n\nVincent slid against the wet grass, grasping for the fallen anthropologist’s gun. Caked in blood and gore he rolled against the corpse and fired upwards into the beast as it pounced again. Both men were screaming as it dug its teeth into the Sewn Eyed Man. Blood exploded as the White Lion slammed the grizzled native into the ground again and again, and then vanished.\n\nSilence fell across the watering hole. DeWitt and Vincent were covered blood, mud, and tears. Terror. Screaming. They ran away, as fast as they could. Panicked flight drove them far and away from the cave and safety. They ended as the strange eldritch tree that Vincent had found earlier. In his haste Vincent tore his clothes and stole DeWitt’s lighter to make a torch, setting the surrounding grass ablaze to make a fiery security wall.\n\nThey awoke hours later. It was dark now, stars filling the skies. And lights were heading their way. Both men panicked, rushing about and trying to hide somewhere. But the vast open plains offered little camouflage. They cowered as the lights came closer, flashlights carried by Harris and the crew of the Sally’s Delight. They had come to find the hunters after they never came back to the abbey. DeWitt delivered the grim news, with a furious determination to weapon up and kill the creature. Vincent was more eager to join the crew and return to the safety of the abbey camp. There was much argument.\n\nDeWitt took off into the grass, screaming for revenge. Two crewman chased after him desperately. Vincent urged the others to fall back to camp immediately, that DeWitt was too far gone. The rescue party reached the ship after a tense and slow crawl through an eternal night. There was no time to pack up. They boarded the boat and shipped out fast. DeWitt and the two crewman never returned. The White Lion had struck again, claimed more lives. The crew hated to leave their boss, but Vincent implored them to abandon this quest. They agreed, but made the artist accept that he would need to look after the Widow Sutterfield.\n\nVincent locked himself into his cabin, still clutching the totem and J.G.’s rifle. The totem felt warm and friendly in his hand. His easel lay against the wall, and he started to paint. It was not J.G. Wilder and his triumphant fight with the White Lion. It was a haunting portrait of a dead man, Jimmy DeWitt.",

        "text": "Let me tell you a tale. A tale of heros, villains, and assholes; mostly assholes. A tale of incompetence, and victory. Of tragedies and Glories. And most of all, a tale of 4 idiots in Space.\n\nEven though I do play one of the characters, I will be writing this in the 3rd person. I hope this won't be too biased towards my character in terms of information, but if so, I'm sorry. This was over a year ago, and my memory is not perfect.\n\nLet us begin.\n\nNow, I'll be telling this in parts, each part a different session (there will be one exception to this rule however).\n\nFirst the basics. We were running a form of Dungeons and Dragons similar to 3.5 called D20 Modern, along with some additions that made it an intergalactic adventure with lasers and space battles.\n\nWe had a party of 4 people.\nRoscoe: Our pilot, and by far the most average character in the group. He was a pilot in one of the two Human Factions back in what was called \"the Hess War\" and was left for dead in the middle of space. He was found and made a cyborg by the mysterious Wendigo (Dislcarmer, Wendigo is not a Wendigo, he's just some rich guy in space)\n\nElliot: Our ship's captain, and a noodle of a man. He was the only real charismatic member of the party, and was some kid with rich scientist parents who just wanted to be a Space Ship Captain. He was the flimsiest character by far. We were 90% sure he wouldn't survive more than 3 sessions.\n\nWukong: The Ape Man with a shot Gun and the ship's Gunner. He is just an Humanoid Ape with a Shot Gun, genetically engineered by Wendigo. He was for some reason, very attractive to Women. He also had a son somewhere that we would have to find. No one hated Wukong.\n\nAnd my character Emyr: A Ranger from 5e D&amp;D and a raging alchoholic. Also the ship Engineer and Medic. If you read the Story of Nogy then you'd remember him. Honestly neither I or Emyr know how he suddenly went from a fantasy world to 6000 years in the future. Theories range from some ancient curse, or just bad luck. Anyways now he's in the future and ready to murder. The DM basicly allowed to me to have freedom for my inventory, what ever medieval stuff I wanted (within reason) I could have. I also had a log (a wooden log); this log will become important. No one liked Emyr.\n\nThere was also a French computer AI for our space ship played by our DM. So K0ATL is a character.\n\nNow with all that over with, let's get into the session.\n\nThe four characters were gathered on a space station, in a secret part of space probably. It was their first meeting with each other, and their employer, the mysterious Wendigo. The Mystery Man arrived in the form of a hologram and gave them their first Job. It was simple: get a small data chip. The Chip was held on a small mining base on a cold desolate planet named Erethin.\n\nWe were given our ship the K0ATL and to prepare ourselves we did a simulation. The simulation for the most part, pretty well, the only hiccup being Elliot becoming panicked by the situation. The panic was subdued by a simple nat 20 smack to Elliot's face by Emyr's Log, which would be known as the Medical Log.\n\nBut after the simulation the party was off!\nEveryone set up shot somewhere in the ship, Elliot got the Captain's Quarters, Roscoe would sleep in the Pilot's Chair, Wukong sat in the Gunner's Chair, and Emyr made himself a little cot in the Engine Room.\nHowever, we soon found our first \n\nThe flight goes by, back stories were told, fun time.\n\nEventually though, the team arrives at Erithen to find the station under manned. We dock up and leave the ship. After leaving the ship, the team is greeted by someone who can only be described as a: \"complete fucking nerd.\" No one knows the Nerds beginnings, his life, his loves, but they do know how it ended...\n\nAt first, the party acts as if their supposed to be there. He does lead us around for a bit, but once the Nerd realizes that a party with a 7 ft tall Monkey Man, and a Game of Thrones extra was not right, the situation turned to what any good D&amp;D NPC encounter should turn to: Kidnapping and Interrogation.\n\nBy this point, the party is in a room with some mining lasers. Elliot and Roscoe work their intimidation, the nerd panicking, tells us the basics, just because he works there, doesn't mean he knows the good stuff. He snitches on his Boss, saying she has the chip, and that she has the ship, and that she's an absolute bitch. Not content for what the Nerd has to say, Emyr in an attempt to get more information out of him, stabbed the Nerd in the Knee with his dagger. The Dagger would come to be known as Nerdsbane\n\nThe Party was not pleased.\nAs the Nerd screamed, security came to his rescue.\n\n\"Drop the Nerd\"\nwas the first thing Security said. Soon enough it escalated, a shot was fired. One of the Security guards attempted to fire his stun gun at the party.\n\nNat 1\n\nInstead of hitting who it was intending to hit, probably Emyr or Wukong, instead, old Nerd Boy was hit rendering him unconscious.\n\nRoll Initiative\n\nEveryone rolled pretty well. 15, 12, 10. What about Wukong?\nWukong got a Natural 1.\nWukong dropped his shotgun.\nThe shotgun went off\nright into the unconscious nerd.\nA moment of Silence for the Nerd.\n\n\n\nThe battle was on. Emyr after firing a shot with his bow, went in with his sword. Wukong picked up his shot gun and went into a sort of gunplay with the enemy. Roscoe gave supporting fire to Wukong. But what was Elliot doing? After a few turns, Elliot, being the smartest character in the group, had a plan.\n\nYou see, Elliot had some radioactive isotopes in his pocket, as one does. His plan was to throw them into the mining reactor, start an alarm, and get the enemy to flee in an evacuation.\nElliot executes the plan, the isotopes fly in perfectly.\nThe alarm does go off. But it's because the isotopes are causing a dangerous reaction, which is going to destroy the base, because fun fact, throwing unstable radioactive items into a mining reactor doesn't cause good things.\nTo recap, in an attempt ease the mission, Elliot gave us a time limit.\n\nThe party wins the skirmish. Wukong disarmed an enemy by removing his arms with his shotgun. Emyr soon stabs the man in the neck, in what he claimed was putting him out of his misery. Emyr then took his broken gun and dumped the body in one of the mining lasers. Emyr now has a Gun and a reputation I felt I had to keep up. Looking back on it now, I don't know why anyone let this happen.\n\nThe party moves on, only to find the doors in front of him. Emyr attempted to use the Medical log to unlock the key pad (it had worked before on other things, why not this). That door was then broken. To this day, I don't know what was behind it. Eventually someone gets a card off the dead security guards and unlocks the right door. They were met with sniper fire.\n\nThe Boss was making her stand in her office, ready with a sniper rifle. Emyr was shot and in a move of self preservation, fled; running back to the ship, getting in the captains chair, activated K0ATL mode 420 smoked some \"anesthesia\" and began to preform some medical care on his self.\n\nBack at the skirmish, it resolved its self.\nThe super battle with Queen Bitch, in attempt to get to the Boss, Roscoe found a metal sheet somewhere and was holding it up as cover so that he and Elliot could advance without getting obliterated. Because they were up against a laser sniper, the sheet was heating up, so I had to use my cybernetic arm to hold it.  We got there, got the chip, and offered her a deal. Be left on the planet to die, or come with us as our prisoner\nAfter taking her prisioner they take a block of highly valued metal and the boss bitch back to the ship.\n\nThe party met up with each other on the ship and set off quickly. The base is after all, about to blow up. And as the ship leaves the atmosphere, a large explosion can be seen from space, emanating from the mine. Remember that place, it becomes important again later.\n\nMission successful, now it's time to get the pay.\n\nBut first a taste of danger! From space!\n\nOut from the depths of space came another ship, attacking us. Wukong manned the guns and Roscoe took evasive maneuvers. As the combat continued damage was sustained was to the wings of the ship, and Emyr, while being the one with the least experience with Technology, was responsible for ship repairs. Equipping an envirosuit he climbed out of the airlock to make repairs. Meanwhile Roscoe flew almost flawlessly, and Wukong was wracking up the damage. After a good dog fight, Elliot came up with a daring maneuver, to make a u turn flying above the enemy ship and venting the engines. You see, do to the nature of the engines, you have to vent the radiation once a day or else bad things happen. I'm not sure what, its never happened yet. Anyways, Roscoe makes the U Turn, the Engines get vented and for the brief moment where each crew could see each other, Elliot gave them the middle finger. The enemy ship went up in flames and the day was won.\n\nAfter getting back to Wendigo's station, not tursting Wendigo, Elliot and Roscoe arranged what basically came down to a hostage situation, to make sure we got our pay.\n\nLucky for us it worked, and the team got their pay. We even got our new mission, to go to New New Deli and get information on some terrorist group or something, that doesn't really matter yet. But for now, the party celebrated by spending money. We went to New New Deli, sold that hunk of metal, bought some upgrades to the ship, K0ATL got a Laser that the French AI got to operate himself.\n\nOur first mission was a success, a mess, but a success.\n\nTune in next week for Session 2 of Charlemange Company",

        "text": "Hello people! I give you the tale of Nogrith Alagar, my first PC, who still haunts me to this day.\n\nAbout a year ago, I finally got into tabletop gaming with a game of Dungeons and Dragons. Because I didn't own any of the handbooks yet, and had to share at the game, I asked one of my friends to help me out.\n\nSo my friend sends me to some random website that is supposed to make character creation super easy for newcomers. Through the simple steps and my friend walking me through it, I create a rock gnome wizard, named Nogrith Alagar.\n\nFrom here, the problems only get worse. Nogrith was slower than anyone else that he would work with, none of his stats had a +2 modifier, and all his spells were offensive. With no bonus to Constitution, at first level his HP was 6.\n\nThen came the part to write his personality. I chose for Nogrith to have a crippling flaw, which went well with his low Charisma: Split-Personality Disorder. Everything else about him was fairly generic newbie stuff, but the most critical part of this story lies within his choice of weapons: A quarterstaff.\n\nNogrith's (Or Nogi for short, my party has argued it's spelt Noggy) introduction to the group was having drunk too much the previous night, only to have been screwed over by his soon-to-be tiefling bard friend casting Thaumaturgy on him repeatedly as he drunkenly stumbled out of the tarvern and fell asleep in a ditch. The next member, a human ranger, declared that Gnomes are a delicacy and that he had taken me in order to make Gnome Bacon the following morning. This intro served as the start of the trash fire that is Nogi (and the start of annoying and picking on every single character of mine).\n\nAs Nogi came to, tied to a goat, he tried putting on his best Scottish accent. Charisma roll, and he fails, only mustering a squeak. Soon the bard, Lucius, comes out and saves Nogi from certain death in the stomach of Emyr, the ranger. Nogi tries to get all three members to work together and travel the road side by side.\n\nArriving at a town, with wind blowing heavily over their head, Nogi directs the new party to go to a tavern (when I say direct, I mean I agree because Nogi is getting picked on. Upon entering, Nogi tries to be as rough-sounding as possible, only to fail, causing him to squeak again.\n\n\"This will come in handy later,\" I think to myself, \"somehow, I'll make something awesome happen with this squeak.\"\n\nAfter eavesdropping on some scholars from a university, Lucius discovers a nearby cave with some ruins has been overrun by kobolds. Naturally, as any Good-aligned party will do, we agree to go out and defeat them. The ruins, including a shell-shaped building in town, are places of former worship to a dragon called Akoda.\n\nAfter examining the front, hiding in a tree, almost being killed with one shot, and killing those responsible, Nogi and team enter the caves, preparing to eliminate all of the kobolds, but what they didn't plan for was the Split-Personality Disorder taking over. In a bid to get through the kobolds faster, Nogi decides to seduce one of the kobolds in a room filled with three of them. By some stroke of luck, he rolls high enough to get the kobold to put down his weapons and allow Nogi to caress his inner thigh. The DM decides at that point that after caressing him, the kobold becomes too embarrassed and quickly rushes past us. We kill the others, since they didn't seem to take on Nogi's pleas for peace. \n\nAs we navigate further, Emyr remembers he left his goat outside the cave, and swears to beat the shit out of Nogi if the kobold took it. After making it outside, a quick puzzle occurs, then we fight the leader of the kobolds, a shaman. After we defeat them with steady ease, we loot the altar, picking up a weird metal claw. After that, we all see a massive shadow overhead. What was it? None of us knew, cause we all rolled fucking abysmally for Perception.\n\nMaking our way back, we find a part of the wall that fits the claws of the claw thing we found. A bit of jumping, and losing his backpack, and Nogi now has a kitestaff, turning him essentially into Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender, due to all the wind and his small size.\n\nUpon exiting the cave, a rock with carvings on it is found next to our goat. Nogi is more relieved than Emyr, and we are all confused as to what the rock might be. Lucius is the only one who could read it, thanks to a spell of his, and proceeds to read aloud for all to hear a love letter, written by Grenja, the kobold whom Nogi romanced ealier, bidding Nogi to join him.\n\nBefore we continue, it's imperative to know that throughout the whole cave trek, Nogi only cast 1 spell, and around 3 cantrips. This was the tactic he had planned, believing he could take on fools easily.\nBefore he can reunite with his love, Nogi goes back into town. Destroyed by the shadow we all saw earlier, we soon discover that it was a dragon, the shell building is destroyed, and we put two and two together. Akoda is back! Shit, we gotta kill him! But we're still good guys, we gotta look for survivors. We approach the tavern from earlier, and discover survivors are in the cellar. Due to what I assume was several barricades and a trapdoor between us, the barkeep can't remember it's us, the weird fellows from earlier, thinking we were bandits who destroyed the town. \"This is my time to shine\" I say, as I attempt to put on a gruff voice. Roll Persuasion.\n\nNat 1.\n\nNogi lets out a gigantic squeak, built up from the cave spelunking. Instantly, the barkeep remembers who we are, and the survivors all climb out of the cellar. After some puzzle solving in the ruins of the shell building, the party (along with a new monk friend, who joined us at the tavern) sets out to the college the scholars came from, hoping to gleam info on killing Akoda.\n\nAlong the way, the party hears lovely singing on the road. Clearly it's a trap, but the party all goes to check it out. It's two harpies and a peryton! What's a peryton? Well, it's basically a bird that fucks over second level wizards who have 8 HP and think they can charge with a quarterstaff. As you can assume, the fight went horribly for Nogi, who, at the start, could not shake the influence of the harpies. As such, he can only attack the peryton, except he also can't, because it's flying and Nogi forgot he has spells.\n\nAfter getting dive-bombed, failing two saving throws, and stabilized (note the words chosen) by Lucius, Nogi proceeds to actually use his spells in the fight. When the battle is over, he takes a piece out of Lucius' handbook and carves words into the peryton's body (Lucius had previously done this with music notes on a kobold, then kicked it down a rapid). When the party goes to sleep, Nogi still hasn't healed himself. He dies in his sleep peacefully, after two sessions of existance.\nAnd so another PC is claimed. \n\n[However, the story doesn't end there.](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/a7/a78ae76da19c1a0f9e0e9b2f7e6229e70bd36cf7bc5b2f29b5f8900face50234.jpg)\n\nIn the aftermath of Nogi's death, my group has created a new term, which I hope will soon take off and be immortalized in the dictionary: Noggying.\n\nNoggying, verb\n\n[Nog-ee-ing]\n\n1: When a low level spellcaster attempts to tank, forgetting they have low health and spells that have range. See also stupidity, idiocy, idiot.\n\nApart from that, Nogi has also become a mainstay in the worlds I DM for. He takes on the role of a painter, and knows of his previous life as a failed adventurer. As an art student, a friend of mine made a small reference to him in a script that he wrote for a fantasy production. Only five people got the joke. And last but certainly not least, Nogi is forever immortalized as a gnome keychain the DM of that game gave as a gift on my birthday this year. It was even wrapped in the map upon which he died on. And I'm sure that down the line, Nogi will show up in other places, for he is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nI wish I could say that I imagine Nogi somewhere, running free with Grenja, wearing Akoda's bones as armor, but we all know that he died in field on the side of a road, because he was too stupid to heal himself. As such, he died as he lived; a complete fucking moron.",

        "text": "Fair warning this story comes from Crusader Kings II, and Crusader Kings II does make you a monster.\n\nAlright, so I'm a fan of Ck2. Enough of a fan to have played over 700 hours in the last few years; but looking at other people's play times, a modest number.\nAnyways, so my friend had previously linked me a comedy Ck2 Video, one where the person plays as the Count of Cornwall in 1066 and conquers the world. This isn't a world conquest story. So when I was trying to decide what to play next my friend suggested playing Cornwall. So I did, and it was going pretty well, through war and intriuge I had made myself Duke of Cornwall, and Spymaster for the King of England. \nBut I wanted more.\n\nLong had I envied the power of the house of Godwinson, with their family controlling most if not all of the Duchies in Southern England, not to mention the Throne of England. Now of course, I had to play my cards right, and cards I had.\nThe first move would come in securing the Duchy of East Anglia, the duchy that should traditionally be held by the King, since London sits within the Duchy, but through the complicated mess that is inheritance, it would not stay in the Kings hands. I married my Eldest Son off to the Princess of England, hoping to maybe snatch up the title of King. The King later turned up dead, under suspicious circumstances (funny how that happens) and the young Prince, who was less than 6 years old at the time, was crowned King, and promptly overthrown by his Uncle. Now, I was caught, everyone knew it was the spymaster behind the late King's death, and this probably 5 year old boy declared himself my rival. That poor 5 year old, messing with the Tywin Lanister of Cornwall. Due to him being my rival I declared war on him to remove him from his position of Duke of Essex, which, due to the previous Coup'deta was now all the young prince held. The war wasn't long, I won some key battles, executed one of the boys uncles who happened to lead the army of the Boy duke of Essex. After the war, with the Boy Duke of Essex now in my dungeon, I as the good Duke of Cornwall, and Spymater to the King of England, in my wisdom, and mercy, I hung that six year old boy. Not my proudest moment, but hey, the Duchy if Essex was safe and in my control.\nIn summary:\nI hung a six year old kid who's father I murdered, and who's uncle I executed. All to attain more power, this gives me more power because I betrothed my eldest son to his sister while his dad (who I murdered) was still king. So that means I'll get the duchy of Essex because of this.\n\nThat was phase one of my plans to gain power. Phase 2 would be messier, and hopefully involve less Child murder. \n\nBy phase 2 years had gone by, Kings came and went (mostly under suspicious circumstances) and the new King had been embroiled in what would become a 20 year long civil war in the North of his realm. This didn't really affect anything, it's just another reason for England's coming Anarchy. But when does my meddling come in? Well I'll tell you. The Duchy of Essex had long stood as a bastion of Godwinson control in England, I (this is still the same character by the way) the Tywin Lanister of Cornwall, declared war, supporting my Second Eldest's claim to the Duchy. My second Eldest was very much like his father, and I hoped for him to succeed him, but son number one was still around and I couldn't lose my control over Essex. The war was looking to go A-okay, it would be easy, but then my nephew decided to try and overthrow me, declaring himself the Duke of Cornwall. So now I have to fight East Anglia, and put down a revolt. Alright, so I made an Alliance with the Duke of Kent (the only Godwinson Duchy to escape my wrath) and called him into the war. Things were turning around, but this English Cluster fuck only got bigger. Enter a new player, the Duchess of Mercia, neither Godwinson or Cornish, but just as power hungry. She Declared war on me in an attempt to claim the Duchy of Cornwall. I honestly don't remember how she got that claim, but she had it, and I was now at war with 3 different factions. But all was not lost, a savior came in the form of another opportunistic Duke, the Duke of Hwicce, declared war on Mercia in hopes to reclaim territory from Mercia. Now with Mercia occupied and Kent at my back, I pushed on East Anglia. I won the war with East Anglia, my son was made Duke of East Anglia, and like the Italy of this World war 1 (if world war 1 were just in southern England) changed sides. My nephew was soon defeated, and his title revoked (I didn't execute him, he is family after all), I was then able to make peace with the duchess of Mercia. \nOn a side note: during the Anarchy, the Mad king at the time declared that Turnips the state currency.\n\nEngland was fucked up.\n\nBut I was on my way to becoming King, all I needed was to start phase 3... But my badass character was then murdered by his own son....\n\nAnd I never touched Cornwall again.",

My character was a halfling cleric with the character trait that she would go to great lengths to help others.\n\nAt one point, we fought a swarm of goblins that had been magically shrunk to the size of mice. During the encounter, one of our fighters took one, broke its limbs and put it in his pocket. My cleric felt sorry for the little goblin because it was so small and helpless.\n\nAfter the encounter, I asked Igor if I could hold on to the goblin for him and rolled a 4 on my persuasion check. The barbarian also took pity on the tiny goblin and helped me, which granted me advantage and I rolled a 10 on my second roll. Igor rolled an 8 against it, so he gave to goblin to me.\n\n\"How much of it do you want?\"\n\n\"All of it. Alive.\"\n\nOnce I had the tiny goblin, I made it little splints out of whatever I could find and put it in my pocket. Throughout the rest of the game, I kept a bit of distance and cast Sacred Flame instead of running up and using melee attacks, so as not to endanger the tiny goblin in my pocket, who I started calling Pip, short for Pipsqueak. At the end of the game, I still had a few spell slots left, so I cast Cure Wounds on him to mend his broken bones.\n\nNow Pip rides on my character's shoulder and in her pocket. If I get this cleric with them again, I'm going to start trying to teach him Common in the downtime. Also, she'll probably be on the lookout for doll furniture and other miniature items for his use.",

        "text": "Day 1: \n\nI spawned on the edge of the desert and immediately heard voices in the distance. Cautiously approaching, I can see 3 clothed men armed with bows yelling \"Friendly! Friendly!\" The nearest one to me is named Kr0n KiNg. They all begin to open fire on me, launching arrows of betrayal in my direction. Realizing I have no weapon, I flee to the rocky hills barely escaping with my life. \n\nHiding in the darkness, I spot a sputtering flame in the distance. My now freezing body demands that I seek out the warmth of the light. As I approach, still unarmed, I see the outline of a figure performing some sort of dance ritual. I approach the flame and salute, the man grabs his spear and offers his greetings. We both pretend I didn't just witness him dry humping the air. As I warm myself by the fire, he tells a tale of being hunted by three bowmen in the wilderness. In the distance we can hear the angry pleading of a player begging for mercy. I can almost hear the innocence dying with him. \n\nDay 2:\n\nI leave the strange man with his fire and head further inland. I happen across a man by the name of lolsgan who proves to be a valiant deer slayer and a loyal friend. We quickly team up and fashion some clothes and crude weapons for ourselves. We happen across a fellow survivor who invites us to his home. It's probably only a 5 minute jog down the road so we agree. As we round the bend of the road, we can see an abandoned town full of mutant pigs. The third man says to be careful as there are lots of things that will try to kill us out here. He seems to be quite experienced and can quickly answer questions we have like what happens to our gear when we die or which monsters shoot poison. As we make our way through the old town, I notice some movement in the far hills--what appeared to be a man with a bow. Recalling my last run-in with a bow-wielding player, I advise caution to our group of 3. We keep following our guide down the road toward a fire. When I spot a second bowman, I call out \"It's an ambush, find cover!\" I am suddenly aware of the fact that our third man has been silent. Squatting behind a rock just past the fire, and brandishing my spear, I prepare for the worst. lolsgan is almost to the safety of my rock when a volley of three arrows is released into his back. He falls, lifeless at my feet. I didn't even get a chance to add him on Steam. I charge around the corner at my assailants and stab wildly in all directions wounding two of the three bowmen. As I fall, I get one good look at my attackers and recognize Kr0n KiNg and Mr3nigma from our previous encounter.\n\nDay 3: \n\nI head back to the town where we were betrayed and hope to find my buddy or my attackers. The only thing I discover is a wrecked vehicle. As I enter the husk of a car, the world soars away from me, skyward, and I realize that I am [falling infinitely](http://i.imgur.com/nbnHkaZ.jpg) to my death. As I awake, I decide to head back to our old deerslaying grounds in the hopes that I might run into lolsgan again. As if summoned, lolsgan emerges from the bushes brandishing an axe. \n\n\"Whoa hey buddy it's me!\" I exclaim.\n\n\"Oh hey man, I was just looking for you!\" he replies.\n\n\"Man, I can't believe that guy led us on for that long just to kill some fresh spawns. Some people play this game like it's EVE Online or something.\" \n\n\"I know right? Let's build a fort!\" lolsgan suggests. \"Once we have the walls up we'll be safe.\"\n\nI agree to the plan and we scout out a cool location next to a stone arch. We discover a few abandoned player houses nearby, all of them stripped bare. My daughter wants to watch Ant Man, so I tell lolsgan I'll be on in an hour or two.\n\nDay 4:\n\nI message lolsgan and we continue work on the house. He's got a 4x4 foundation set up with about half of the walls up. We need a lot more wood. As I eat an orange I hear the familiar sound of a bow being drawn and an arrow being loosed. Something whizzes over my head. Turning to lolsgan, expecting to see him messing with his new bow, I instead see two bowmen climbing the hill and launching arrows at me. Scrambling for cover, I go to warn lols, but he is already on the defense. He manages to hit one of the attackers, but it's not a fatal blow and they press forward. Scrambling for a weapon, I whip out my spear and try to circle around the enemy. As soon as I step off the rocks, lolsgan takes an arrow to the face and dies. The assailants are going through his inventory and now is my time to strike. I stab the one pointing his bow at me and get one good hit in before I'm downed by an arrow. \n\n    hey man I think I'm done for the night. --lolsgan\n\nDay 5:\n\nI set off to craft a bow. After gathering all the supplies, and crafting a bow and set of arrows, I set out into the wild to hunt. A naked man runs out of the bushes swinging his spear at me. I unleash my arrows into his body and he falls. 15 minutes of infamy. Near the end of the 15 minutes, I notice a duo of bowmen approaching, I don't believe they have seen me yet, and I position myself behind some trees until they are right on top of me. We all aim our bows at each other, and they ask if I'm friendly. I do not reply. Eventually they say I can tag along if I want to. It is at this moment I notice their names: Kr0N KiNg and Mr3nigma! They explain to me that they are meeting up with their third teammate so they can all head across the desert to their secret lair. I never get a good look at the third player because by the time we find him he is doing battle against a poisonous raptor. As we arrive to finish off the beast, the third man dies and Kr0n and Mr3nigma divide up his loot between the two of them. They decide we should all press on, and the third man will meet us at base. Trudging through the desert, all three of us begin to slowly perish from heatstroke. Mr3nigma has about 40seconds left, I have 30seconds, and Kr0n has 0seconds and is actively taking damage from heatstroke. I stay behind to watch Kr0n expire. I grab 50 smelted iron, 100 leather/wood, and 40 string from his inventory and 3 stacks of arrows. Catching up to Mr3nigma down by the road I tell him his friend didn't make it. The night is cold by the road at the far end of the desert and there are strange noises all around us. Mr3nigma plants a row of orange seeds and puts together a fire to keep us warm. We are both starving. \n\n\"Maybe the plants will ripen before we starve,\" he says.\n\n\"Yeah, maybe.\" I reply, noncommittally. \"I'm going to go look for some rabbits to hunt so we don't starve.\"\n\nI take a few potshots at some rabbits. I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to kill Mr3nigma now or wait until he gets me into their base. I'm also wondering why the third guy respawned back at the newbie area instead of at his base. Maybe they don't have a totem yet. As I head back to the campfire emptyhanded, I notice pools of acid over everything and a raptor going to town on Mr3nigma. I fire one arrow into the raptor's neck and it goes down. Mr3nigma looks at me and says \n\n\"It doesn't look good man, I think this is it.\" \n\n\"Is there an antidote or something?\" I ask.\n\n\"What? No, I don't know. Everything's all weird and black and hard to see.\"\n\n\"Where's your base?\" \n\nSilence.\n\n\"Hey man, where's your base at so I can meet you guys there?\"\n\nNo response. He's dead.\n\n*So it was that on the sixth day, the third bowman died at the hands of nature. The lone wanderer gathered up what remained of value and set off into the rad-zone never to be seen again.*\n\ntl;dr: A Story Of Betrayal And Vengeance",

        "text": "**This story comes from my most recent session GMing for a weekly group. Let it be noted that I do not mind what a character does in my games as long as it sticks to their character.**\n\nSo the story begins with the crew of the *Typhoon*, a YT-2400 freighter which was provided for their use from their employers the mercenary company the Wailing Winds. The crew consists of a protocol droid technician with a god complex named E-3PO, an assassin droid turned medic named IG-66, and a male Trandoshan mercenary soldier affectionately named Tard from E-3. The crew operates (well operated) out of a \"retired\" Clone Wars era *Venator*-class star destroyer named the *Whirlwind* getting higher paying jobs from The Broker the defacto captain of the ship.\n\nWe join our so called heroes in hyperspace coming back from a deep space research station basically out of the Dead Space universe as far as the atmosphere felt. E-3 was on the last of his remaining circuits from the encounter with the creatures on the station and was going to give the Broker a piece of his processor once back to the *Whirlwind*. While the rest of the crew were dealing with a remaining creature on a ship they brought back with them E-3 went to talk with the Broker.\n\nReaching the main bridge of the *Whirlwind* E-3 found the Broker standing in his normal spot looking over reports on the holotable. Prattling up towards him, E-3 let loose with a scathing tirade of insults and complaints about putting him and his ship in danger and that the pay they had been getting was not enough to cover the danger. During this rant, E-3 let slip a statement that essentially was a \"Fuck you I quit\" phrase. The Broker calmly looked at E-3 and said \"Very well, you are free to leave. Go back to *your* ship and leave the system, don't come to us for work again.\"\n\nAt this point, E-3 clanked back towards the *Typhoon* to meet the rest of the crew after they finished off the rest of the creatures. I took a quick restroom break and allowed the crew to decide what they wanted to do next. In hindsight, this might have been a mistake/the best thing for the moment.\n\nReturning from the restroom there were multiple glances being exchanged with the last portions of a plan being discussed. Jumping back into the game E-3 asked what ship was bigger, the returned YT-2000 from the station or a shuttle that the *Whirlwind* sent to help deal with the creatures. Curious to where this would lead I said the YT was the bigger of the two. Tard and IG disconnected the shuttle and let it drift while E-3 docked the *Typhoon* with the YT. E-3 went and took control of the YT while the rest of the crew transferred to the *Typhoon*. It was at this point the plan became clear as E-3 said and I quote \"I point the ship at the bridge of the *Whirlwind* and punch it to full speed.\" \n\nObviously surprised by this and as the FFG system is a \"Yes, but\" type I agreed to this with multiple checks required. The initial check was a simple one to point the ship at the bridge but I required an Athletics check to make it to the loading ramp to escape. E-3 was able to make it to the ramp and jump out but the momentum still carried him towards the *Whirlwind*. I rolled a d100 to see if E-3 would collide with a part of the ship but rolled a 96 (I ruled higher was better). I rolled a couple of times for the point defense cannons but the fire was not enough to destroy the ship. I play background Star Wars music during my sessions but felt a different song was needed for this moment, I changed the song to the Mercenaries 2 \"Oh no you didn't\" (see the end of the story for a link). As a narrative E-3 flew past the bridge doing a rude gesture just before the impact with the bridge.\n\nNow *Venators* have two bridges, one for main operations the other for fire control and starfighter deployment. The main operations were the one hit so the crew was not out of danger yet. IG flew the *Typhoon* in front of E-3 and lowered the loading ramp to catch E-3. Once caught, E-3 made his way to the cockpit to take over for IG and started to make their way to jump to hyperspace. Making the calculations the *Whirlwind* opens fire onto the *Typhoon* with their heavy turbo lasers and ion cannons only connecting with the ion cannons causing some strain to their ship but overloading the cannons to do so. Tractor beams reached out and halted the flight of the *Typhoon* while a pair of starfighters lanced forth from a hanger.\n\nFeeling a slight weakening with the tractor beam from previous experience E-3 decides to jump to hyperspace while still ensnared by the beam. A note for the reader, ships have strain within this system and they were currently at 13/17 SS (System Strain) having 4 remaining and if the strain exceeds the capacity the ship will shut down with a difficult time to start it back up again. The crew had done a similar trick with a newer Imperial tractor beam but had to sacrifice their escape pod to aid in their escape, but still took 8 strain escaping. Feeling the risk was worth it E-3 punched it, the stars lengthening for a brief moment and then returned to normal. The ship took 3 SS (I rolled a d6) and essentially did a micro jump to get within an extreme range from the *Whirlwind*. A hail mary shot from Tard at the starfighters did not hit them but did succeed in disabling the hanger preventing more starfighters from being deployed until repaired (rolled a Triumph but failed to hit). Shots from the *Whirlwind* did not connect flying through space as the *Typhoon* escaped into hyperspace to find more misadventures to get into.\n\nHope you enjoyed this little look into my game, I am sure there will be plenty more where this comes from with this crew. Sure it derailed what other missions I had planned for them but I can reskin those for different delivery. Plus now they have angered a mercenary group powerful enough to have a *Venator* be a ***branch*** of their forces so that should be interesting.\n \n[The song referenced within the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbE3fGfF-o)",

        "text": "Continued from Part 2a...\n\n\nJethro suddenly caught everyone off guard when he announced that he wanted to ride out with the chest of money and deliver it to the approaching Knights and Tax Men. \n\nHe said he wanted to see the look on their faces when he delivered it – and as a final ‘fuck you’ to the tax men he planned to play ignorance of their impending visit and claim that he had said he would deliver it to the tax men in a few days time anyway, what were all these knight's doing riding towards town? Just in the hope of making the tax men look incompetent in front of the Knights and perhaps (if he was lucky) get them into some bother for wasting the time of the King's Knights. \n\nHe had already negotiated for use of the logging man's heavy wagon for a few days. Silky would drive it and Jethro and His Little Friend would ride along as guards for the money. \n\nAnd so, with final preparations made, the three men quickly set off in a wagon full of the towns money to intercept the tax men and pay the entire towns annual tithe in one lump sum. What could possibly go wrong?\n\r\n\r\nThe money lender could barely believe his luck - apart from being furious after finding out about Rambola Logging Company taking over the logging rights and how Jethro was now in possession of the deeds to the land he had hoped to claim for himself (Jethro had unwittingly informed the lender of his recent acquisition when he had gone and asked the lender for yet another loan – this one a personal loan against his logging company and land deeds. He needed the money for start-up costs. The lender almost choked on his tea when Jethro brought it up). \n\nThe money lender, scheming like an angry cat, sent a messenger raven that very afternoon, telling his career-mercenaries down the road (who were meant to kill the logger-man and the dwarf) to ambush the wagon as it drove down towards the next town. Hurry, in a few days there will be Knights around. Make it look like bandits. Try not to kill the idiots – it will be useful to have someone to blame for losing the money – besides... I have a plan for Rambola. And he owes me a lot of money. \n\n\nThe lender had granted the loan to Jethro – against his logging company. But he had no intention of letting Jethro ever get his logging camp off the ground. And soon, when Jethro was unable to keep up repayments on the loan, ownership of the logging camp would defer to the lender. \n\n\nThis was all falling into place perfectly.\r\n\n\r\nAnd so the Rambola-wagon rolled out of town and the passengers sipped their celebratory brandy. \n\nLittle did they know that several miles south along the winding dusty road the trap was set – and they were obliviously riding into it.\r\n\n\r\nOne day and several miles of dusty dirt-road later (7 Days to Doomsday)...\n\n\r\nIt is the afternoon and the three men are travelling down the road with their wagon. \n\n\nSilky, who is driving hears a galloping horse to the right of him. Someone is riding hard through the woods that line the roadside. And then he sees three more people on horseback burst from the trees and onto the road several metres ahead. The people are all well armoured in chainmail and leather and carry swords. \n\nHe sees two men crouched in the trees on the left with crossbows. \n\nLooking around in panic and letting the horses begin to slow, he spots two more armoured, mounted and well armed men coming out of the trees and onto the road behind them. \r\n\r\nHe screams for the others to wake up. \n\n\r\nYes... the brave guards were valiantly sleeping in the back of the wagon.\r\n\n\r\nOne of the three men in front – the one with the finest armour, black hat and the long dark blue cloak – drew a flintlock and fired at Silky. \n\nThe shot missed. \n\nThe cart horses reared up. \n\nThe wagon came to a halt. \n\nSilky leapt off of the wagon and, howling, began charging at the three men up front. \r\n\n\r\nJethro leapt out of the back of the wagon, axe in hand and swung it at the galloping horseman who had just emerged from the trees next to him. The blow hit home and the horseman was flung from his saddle, a gaping wound in his side – even splitting the chainmail - and several broken ribs, perhaps even a punctured lung.\r\n\n\r\nJethro's Little Friend leapt from the wagon and, holding a large sack of oats out in front of his chest like a shield, ran towards the crossbowmen, loudly insinuating that if their shooting was as bad as their body odour then he had nothing to fear. \r\n\n\r\nThe crossbowmen fired. Two abysmal rolls later and one managed to fumble (99 on a d100), jamming up his crossbow and rendering it useless, the other missed (98 on a d100... what the fuck dice!). A trained mercenary firing a crossbow point blank at a man holding a sack of oats and he fucking missed. \n\nMust have been the insults winding him up and making him shake with rage. \n\n\r\nThe leader of this band of mercenaries (the guy with the cloak and flintlock pistol) decided right there that those two clowns would be stripped of crossbow privileges and demoted to front-liners just as soon as they returned from this mission.\n\r\n\r\nThe other two riders up front (not the leader-guy with the cloak) charge towards Silky, who dives into the trees as he realises his little foraging knife isn't really going to cut it against those swords.\r\n\n\r\nAt this point, I made all players roll intelligence. Not one of them passed so none of them happened to recognise two of the mercenaries as the ‘bodyguards’ who had escorted the new money lender into town upon his arrival.\n \r\n\r\nJethro calls the attackers cowards and sets about charging the men with the crossbows who are looking shamefaced and pissed off. He ignores the two mounted and armoured men charging him down from the rear. \n\n\r\nJethro's Little Friend unbelievably makes it to the crossbowmen only to realise that in a true stroke of genius, he picked up a sack of oats to shield himself and yet forgot to pick up his knife or club, so he does the only thing he can and throws the sack of oats at one of the men before tackling him to the ground and punching him repeatedly in the head. \n\r\n\r\nJethro leaps in and tries to behead the other crossbowman, not quite managing it, but doing a good job of caving the guys skull in with his hefty axe instead. Though not quite dead (yet), that was another would-be robber who was certainly a long way from ‘fighting-fit'. Laying on the ground unconscious and bleeding to death (and most likely with brain haemorrhaging) does not constitute a defensible fighting position. \n\r\n\r\nThe mercenary leader sighs deeply as those same two crossbow-clowns can't even hold their own against two young lads – despite them being armed with only one axe and a sack of oats between them.\r\n\n\r\nSilky, who is quite good at hiding, is in the woods waiting for the two men that were charging him down to venture into the woods after him.\n\r\nHaving lost sight of their clearly slippery prey, the two men were cautious about running into the woods to look for him. Besides, they were here for the money. Not to chase some ugly little snivelling brat into the woods and wind up getting eaten by a fucking bear.\n\n\r\nAs it was, they had come to a halt beside the patch of trees and undergrowth where Silky disappeared and were both peering into the trees from horseback trying to spot where the scraggly little fuck was hiding.\r\n\n\r\nJethro and His Little Friend were engaged from the flank by the two men who had galloped up the road from behind the wagon. JLF was struck a hard blow to the chest and sadly didn't have a bag of oats to protect him. He did have his dads old leather jerkin however and this very much saved his life. As it was he was sprawled out by the roadside, winded, bleeding quite heavily and in no small measure of pain, unable even to voice his displeasure effectively due to several broken ribs rendering it difficult for him to draw breath. In his head he was no doubt making witty condemnations of men who possess such a lack of fighting skill and courage that they have to attack with swords, from horseback, from the flank, against an unarmed man. All anyone else could hear was his low, pained moaning and the occasional half-choked expletive.\r\n\n\r\nJethro managed to throw himself out of the way of the attack and rounded on his attacker. However he was now facing two against one. He swung his axe but one man parried it aside as the other man swung his sword towards Jethro's face. Liking his face the way it was, again Jethro threw himself backwards away from the blow but he was now backing up against the trees.\r\n\n\r\nBy now the mercenary captain had reloaded his pistol and was riding over towards Jethro.\r\n\n\r\nThe two men looking for Silky had edged slightly closer to the trees. Like an enraged badger, Silky pounced from the undergrowth, stabbing his knife deep into one of the men's thighs. \n\nThe man howled in pain and his companion spurred his horse forwards trying to trample Silky. Silky avoided the horse but not the sword the man was swinging and it caught him firmly across the chest, carving his flesh and drawing a fair amount of blood. Silky staggered back towards the trees, as the man he had stabbed in the leg fought to overcome the pain in his thigh. Silky flailed his knife, hitting naught but air and then the man that had just carved Silky's chest reared his horse and it kicked out, this time it caught Silky right in the face, smashing his nose, knocking out several teeth and sending Silky hurling back into the trees, knocked out cold by the side of the road. \r\n\n\r\nJethro squared off with his two attackers and was about to leap into them swinging his axe with wild abandon when the Mercenary Captain, now just a few feet away and pointing a loaded pistol at Jethro, asked Jethro if he could be persuaded to lay down his axe. \n\nJethro looked around and surveyed the scene. \n\nSilky was unconscious and missing several teeth. \n\nJethro's Little Friend was wheezing heavily and lolling around on the floor in a dusty puddle of his own blood like a choking fish.\n\n\r\nJethro himself was rapidly becoming surrounded by armoured and mounted men with swords. Victory was not in the air.\r\n\n\r\n“Alright boy”, began the mercenary leader. Playing up the ‘pretend to be bandits’ order, he continued... “These here are our roads my lad. You can't use our roads unless you pay a toll now can you? Wouldn't be proper that. And I like things to be proper. Otherwise I can lose my temper. That's when I do things I regret. Nobody likes regrets my boy. We'll just take the valuables you've got in yer wagon lad. No need for any heroics. I wouldn't want to have to kill a child now. Not on a lovely day like today.”\n\n\r\nAnd so Jethro Rambola clutched his axe and stood there with gritted teeth as the bandits set to looting his wagon. Which really didn't take long.\n\r\n\r\nThere wasn't much in the wagon. Some food, a few clothes, oh... and the small wooden chest filled with the towns money.\r\n\n\r\nSeeing the chest being removed from the wagon, Jethro was just about angry enough to simply say ‘fuck it’ and run screaming at the nearest person when he was rendered unconscious by a swift blow with something heavy to the back of his head.\r\n\n\r\nAs the mercenaries-pretending-to-be-bandits robbed the wagon, all that could be heard from the party was the sound of JLF, coughing and wheezing and doing his very best to hurl insults at the men. That was until one of them gave him a swift kick and told him to hold his tongue... or lose it.\r\n\n\r\nThankfully, he decided to hold it. \r\n\n\r\nAnd so it was that the three lads found themselves at the business end of a daylight robbery. \r\n\n\r\nAnd once Jethro regained consciousness, much cursing was to be heard. \r\n\n\r\nUntil then it had mostly been the muffled, pained moans of his Wounded Little Friend and the occasional grunt as said Little Friend tried, and failed, to sit up.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Jethro came to he set about tending the wounds of his companions. He cut canvas from the wagon and made impromptu bandages, helped his Little Friend to his feet, and supported him over to the wagon to sit down. \r\n\n\nOnce JLF was ~~comfy~~ in less pain, Jethro headed over to Silky. Silky was also in a fairly bad way and – due to abysmal toughness rolls – still utterly unconscious. Jethro carried him to the wagon and set him down beside JLF before checking the cart-horses. \n\n\r\nIn their haste to get away, the bandit/career mercenaries/hirelings of the money lender, had forgotten to kill or at least lame their horses. (Despite thinking of it, I had completely forgotten to say that they did it – which was a shame. If I had then what occurred next would never have taken place and the final terrible chapter [the imminent part 3] in the tale of Silky the Ratboy, may never have occurred. But I did forget. And so the horses were fine).\r\n\n\r\nSatisfied that the horses were not dead, although at this point I tend to think Jethro would have tried to ride it anyway even if it were, he uncoupled one from the cart, leapt upon its back and set to following the trail back up the road that had been left by their attackers.\n\n\r\nWell he tried to. But being abysmal at tracking he quickly realised he needed his Little Friend. \n\nSo he set about fixing him up as best as he could – which basically comprised of Jethro cursing very loudly whilst making His Little Friend rapidly drink a bottle of stout ale and smoke a fat pipe, coupled with absolutely zero medical attention. \n\n\nWith JLF wincing at every movement, the two of them managed to mount him onto the other cart horse (this was a heavy wagon remember... with 2 horses). \r\n\n\r\nJethro promptly tied JLF into the saddle with a safety line, in case he should succumb to unconsciousness during the journey, and with JLF up front doing his absolute best to not cough up blood and/or die – oh, and point out the trail every now and then – the two of them set off after the bandits. \n\nThe pair were determined to not only reclaim the town’s money, but also to make those “smug-bastard bandit pricks pay in blood for being such utterly irredeemable fuck-nuggets”. \n\r\n\r\nI mentioned to them that they had been unconscious for several hours. With the bandits already ahead by that time, they were in for a long ride if they intended to catch them up and I would need several endurance rolls from both riders and horses in that time. Especially JLF, who was not exactly in prime ‘saddle-time' condition. \r\n\n\r\nWith sheer determination on their side, over the next 10 minutes of game time the players made a flurry of successful rolls, laughing in the face of my description of how tough a ride this would be. \n\nJLF rolled so damn well on his toughness tests (multiple) that I had to determine that his adrenalin and righteous fury had surged enough to grant him a second wind. I mentioned that he still had broken ribs, so he would pay the price for any exertion tomorrow, and the player was good with that. \n\r\n\r\nThey had chased the bandit trail almost all the way back to Oakridge – just a few miles of dusty road short of town – when JLF spotted a smaller trail, one horse, that broke off from the others and headed into the woods. \n\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to them, the bandit leader had broken from his party to go and stash the money (for later delivery to the money lender) at his hidden base camp in the dense woods a few miles outside of town. The rest of the mercenaries were heading to a run down and empty farm house far on the outskirts of the opposite side of town, where they would hole-up and provide what medical treatment they could to their wounded – and soon to be demoted – comrades. And bury those who had been killed. The two men Jethro took down with his axe had succumbed to their injuries and died during the ride back. Only the I-can't-hit-shit crossbowman who had been punched by JLF and the man with Silky’s knife wound in his thigh survived. The mercenary leader didn't care. Short of the inconvenience. He would simply have to get the lender to hire him some more soldiers. Maybe if he paid a premium he could avail himself of archers who could hit the side of a barn. At point blank range. When it is defended only by a bag of oats. \r\n\n\n\r\nAfter some moments of deliberation, Jethro and His Little Friend decided that their horses couldn't take much more. Both ridden near to death in the recent endurance-chase. With this in mind, they slowed pace and followed the single track that lead into the woods. The GM noted the adventuring intuition of these pair of relentless bastards and inwardly congratulated them for their choice. \r\n\r\n\n\nThe two of them had been riding perhaps two miles into the woods when they spotted the horse weaving through the trees about 25 metres away. \n\r\n\r\nIt was the mercenary leaders horse.\n\r\n\r\nHaving not made it to his camp yet (quite honestly these mercs had been taking a quite leisurely pace back. It hadn't occurred to them that they had forgotten to kill the horses back at the scene of the robbery and so they hadn't even been thinking about the possibility of being pursued and, not wanting to ride their horses to death, they had been taking a sensible amount of breaks), the mercenary leader was still sat on said horse. \r\n\n\r\nAnd so it was that by the wee hours of the following morning, under the pallid moonlight of the just-before-dawn sky, Jethro and JLF had caught up with their quarry. \r\n\n\r\nThey spotted the bandit leader atop the horse. As they hadn't expected to come across him so quickly, neither of them were employing the slightest bit of caution nor merest concept of stealth to their approach, and so, the leader also noticed them. Jethro screaming, “Oi you fucking wank-smear” (or words to that effect) may also have helped alert him to their presence. Just in time for their horses to both fail toughness rolls, whinny their last and both collapse to the floor never to trot or canter (or breathe) ever again. \r\n\n\r\nJethro was bucked from the saddle.\n\n\r\nHis little friend would have been, were it not for the safety line that had been tied to him and so, as fell the horse, so fell the man. \r\n\n\r\nFinding himself pinned betwixt floor and beast, though fortunately having suffered no broken bones,  JLF spent the next several rounds trying to squirm out before realising he was in far too much pain for such exertion and simply giving up – opting instead to simply spectate and to put his faith in Jethro ~~winning~~ surviving the encounter and being able to help him free shortly. \r\nIf he hadn't asphyxiated by then as he was finding it slightly difficult to breathe. Crushed as he was beneath a large cart horse.\r\n\n\r\nThe bandit leader smiled to himself and turned his horse around.\n\n\r\n“Well fuck me with seven sacred bells. You're a persistent little brat aint'cha boy? What's a matter, you just don't know when you're beat do’ya lad?”\r\n\n\r\nJethro exchanged a few cutting words before declaring his intention to murder the man and reclaim his box full of money. A task he proceeded to set himself to with frivolous abandon – once he had quickly confirmed that yes, the man was still carrying the chest of silver.\r\n\n\r\nAs Jethro charged forwards (which was pretty much the beginning, middle and end of his planning) the mercenary leader drew and aimed his flintlock pistol. He spent a casual few seconds aiming. A grin spread across his face. \n\n\nThis was too easy. \n\n\r\nAmused to see the desperate futility of Jethro's charge the mercenary leader let the cursing, axe-spinning and mouth frothing Jethro-maniac approach to within just a few metres of him before, smiling a bemused smile, he pulled the trigger.\r\n\n\r\nThe d100 clattered on the table as all eyes bore nervous witness. Even a semi-decent hit here would almost inevitably spell the death – or at least severe maiming – of young Jethro Rambola. And it would certainly end any hope of recovering the chest of silver coins. What with JLF still being pinned under a horse and Silky having been left unconscious, many hours ago, atop a now horseless wagon many miles down the road. \n\n\r\nI rolled a 100. It is met with much laughter from players and GM alike.\n\n\r\nSeriously though, fuck these dice! \n\r\n\r\nIt appeared Jethro would live. (100 = critical-fumble). A quick check on the fumble table and the action continued.\r\n\n\r\nFucking damp shitty climate of these fucking forest roads. \n\nDamp had leached into his pouch of powder rendering the entire fucking lot utterly fucking ruined. \n\r\n\r\nThe mercenary leader’s smile quickly faded to a sardonic frown as his damp powder failed to spark. \n\r\n\r\nHis brain just about had time to process that, yes, he must in fact be cursed, before it was split in twain by a heavy woodsman’s axe arcing gracefully through the air in the hands of a leaping, snarling, screaming, cursing, vengeful and pissed off lunatic.\n\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that Jethro found himself stood in the forest, panting heavily (in between more loud ebullient cursing) covered in another man’s blood and grinning ear to ear, happy to be reunited with his chest full of silver. It was also the story of how Jethro came to be in possession of a fine blue cloak, nice hat, a chainmail shirt, leather greaves, a fine sword and scabbard (given to His Little Friend), good quality knife, flintlock pistol (with shot and pouch of damp and useless powder) and a fully saddled (and well trained) horse. \n\nA veritable treasure trove of corpse-looted goodness. \n\r\n\r\nHe didn't stop smiling all the way back to Oakridge.  \n\r\n\r\nBut he soon would. \r\n\n\r\nSilky had been working on something of his own.\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Session 2",

        "text": "So far the group have established themselves in the town of Oakridge.\n\n\r\nMost recently, Jethro had fallen out with and subsequently threatened the kings tax men (backed by a small rabble) as they tried to tithe the townsfolk and the tax men had left town, vowing to return with the King's Knights in one month to claim all that is owed. \n\nOr else consequences.\r\n\n\r\nAs we join the party again it is the evening of that same day. They have spent the afternoon in the tavern, debating the tithe that both JR and JLF (as property owners) owe, discussing options and formulating plans. Silky's mother owes a small tithe on her hovel but Silky is dispassionate towards her plight. \n\r\n\r\nAs the evening draws in over the quiet town of Oakridge, they have all decided on a course of action. They will all move into Jethro's run down farm. \r\nThe reasons for this were threefold:\r\n\n\r\nOne: So JLF didn't have to pay his tax. He would avoid the tax men upon their return and Jethro would tell the them that JLF had left town - the crown could take his run down little country shack as forfeit and good fucking luck to them - may particularly large crabs forever enrage their genital regions - all hail the gracious king. Without work, the place would probably fall down in a year or two and as he had lived their alone and had no other family/children to worry about, what the fuck did JLF care. Besides, there was fuck all there of value. Not once they had moved what little furniture and personal property JLF owned to Jethro Rambola's farm.\r\n\n\r\nTwo: Silky had nowhere really to live and in all likelihood it looked like his mother would lose her home and relocate to a place in the ~~country~~ dungeon. On top of that, his home life was pretty shitty and the farm availed him the opportunity to look for small dead animals to collect without having to stray too far from 'home'. He could also cause a bit more trouble and generally be creepier around town and didn't have to worry so much about anyone coming to his house to 'politely ask' him to leave them/their house/wife/daughter/horse/livestock/relatives bones alone. And if anyone found out he lived on Jethro's farm and visited there to 'have a friendly little chat', chances were that Jethro (or at least Jethro's Little Friend) would be there to protect him. \r\n\r\n\nThree: Jethro could keep a closer eye on the other two - but mostly Silky. \r\n\r\n\nAnd so the plan was set in motion and the three of them began squabbling over who would sleep where and who was responsible for the cooking. \n\n\r\nSilky volunteered but knowing of his little box of dead delights and his fondness for general weirdness, the other two were reluctant to allow him to prepare their food. \n\n\r\nAnd with good reason to be fair.\n\n\r\nSilky had spent an ongoing proportion of his time out in the countryside gathering a few herbs... well... poisonous plants (the only knowledge his mother had ever really imparted to him was a country-wisdom of edible herbs and flowers - many of his childhood meals were foraged from hedges/the woods/farmers fields). \r\n\r\n\nSilky had been vaguely unsuccessful so far, due to the season, and not being particularly skilled, but had gathered a small amount of some mildly toxic and/or hallucinogenic fungi. We agreed that his character had been doing this sort of thing for a while now (pre-game) and so had a small collection of herbs on top of the handful of poisonous mushrooms he had found since the game began. He specified that he was only really interested in the poisonous stuff his mother had always told him to stay away from when gathering food and so had actually learnt little from his mothers lessons but had instead reversed her lessons in a sort of inverted learning to suit his more nefarious desires.\r\n\r\n\nGiving that crazy bastard access to your food was an inevitable path to becoming his none-consenting test subject for whatever herb/flower/root/leaf/dead animal and/or insect he had recently 'foraged'.\r\n\r\n\nFinally the squabbling died down and it was decided that they would simply cook for themselves over a communal stove, making Silky promise not to use cooking pans to store or mix herbs ever and making it painfully clear that should he ever be caught tampering with their food they would strip him, tie him to the back of a horse and drag him around town and through the surrounding countryside like a human plough until his skin hung from his body in worse shreds than the tattered and raggedy-ass clothes he wore. Silky sullenly promised. \n\r\n\r\nEverybody knew it meant nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, with the tithe looming and the town in a spot of bother, young Jethro was sat in the tavern thinking deeply, mulling over his options over a stout ale and a pipe full of the finest. \r\n\n\r\nWe had agreed that given his friendly and helpful attitude towards his fellow townsfolk since the game began, it was fair to assume that he had always interacted pleasantly with them and as such he was probably on good terms with many of them since the pregame (before the game began). \n\n\r\nAs it was, because of his ongoing actions (which we will get to shortly) and undying concern for the welfare of his fellow townsfolk, as time progressed over the coming month, Jethro started garnering a bit of a reputation as the towns resident ~~good samaritan~~ folk-hero. \r\n\n\r\nSo, back to the tax problem. \n\r\nJethro had no steady income. Whatsoever. And he grew only a personal supply of food on his farm, having left most of his land to fall to ruin alongside the broken down farmhouse and barns. He knew there was little chance over the next month of getting all the money together that he owed - by itself it was a fair, but not insurmountable, sum - however, the thing was, Jethro was not only concerned for his own debt. \n\r\nJethro, feeling overly confident and friendly, had emphatically promised to help any and all the other poverty-stricken Oakridge occupants who were struggling to pay. \r\n\r\nAnd so young Jethro Rambola and His Little Friend concocted, and then enacted, a plan. \n\r\nOperation ‘Goodwill Hunting’ was set in motion.\r\n \r\nOver the next few weeks, Jethro and his Little Friend set about assisting every single person they could with absolutely any task they had. For free. All they wanted was the goodwill and support of their neighbours.\n\r\n\r\nNeed the roof fixing on that old barn Mrs. Pig-Farmers wife? Jethro Rambola can do it. What's that? No, no charge - why yes of course you can at least cook us dinner tonight to say thank you. Of course my little friend knows how to use that roofing hammer. No don't worry, we promise not to leave Silky unattended near your property at any time. \r\n\n\r\nWhat Mr. General Store owner, you haven't been able to get your new stock back from the city because high winds have blown over a tree a few miles west and said tree is now blocking the road so your wagon can't get past. No need to worry. I've got  a nice axe and My Little Friend can help me, we'll get down there and clear that road for you, just you wait and see. No don't worry. We promise we won't be letting Silky anywhere near your wagon full of goods. What's this... no we weren't expecting any money for our trouble. You keep that money and put it towards old Farmer Giles' tab. I know he still owes you for that last order of cattle feed and the poor old codger is struggling to raise his tithe as it is.\r\n\n\r\nWhat's that Mr farmer from session 1? The wolves are back (because we did a really shoddy job of chasing them away the first time). Fear not. I, the mighty Jethro Rambola, and my trusty sidekick Jethro's Little Friend shall drive these furry demons back to the gates of lupine hell. Yes Silky, actually we really would appreciate your help with this one - just try not to offer yourself as a sacrifice this time and we'll be fine. \r\n\n\r\nAnd so it was. Over a few weeks they fixed properties, cleared roads, ejected drunks from the tavern, solved neighbourly disputes, found a lost dog (despite Silky's best efforts), got drunk, broke noses - defending Silky from yet more (well deserved) consequences of his creepiness, helped plant crops, cleared fields, tended orchards and collected apples, looked for (but never found) a missing sheep from the shepherds flock (Silky was responsible for that one. He had killed the sheep in secret the night before... because obviously he wanted to take the eyeballs, tongue and heart out and put them in his box)...\r\n\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that his box was really starting to smell foul by this point and to avoid having it confiscated by Jethro - not least because it was fucking creepy, attracting flies, and a bloody health hazard - he had taken to burying it around the farm - and then later, the surrounding countryside).\r\n\n\r\n...They rode as 'bodyguards' for the old money lender when he (and we will learn why shortly) was leaving town. They escorted him as far as the next town, where he took a stagecoach further into the kingdom. Despite having not spoken too much during the journey (they were doing their best impressions of battle hardened veteran warriors) they found out why the old lender was happy to be leaving (you will too in a moment) and at the end he gave his escorts a very generous wage – which this time they did actually accept. \n\n\r\nAnd yes, they killed wolves - once again having to protect Silky as he nearly got pounced on from behind having chosen, for some logic-defying reason, to stop mid-combat and start to skin one of the slain wolves...\n\n\r\nThere was lots of other small stuff they took care of, but I won't list everything. Just picture them, busy as demented bees at a honey riot, doing all they could for anyone they could coerce/beg/hassle/pester into giving them a task. \r\n\n\r\nThey were making friends rapidly and quickly gaining the trust of most the townsfolk (save for the young lads with broken noses - thankfully most of whom were from the same family group - and the occasional 'Silky-really-pissed-that-guy-off' social casualty) and they were starting to be seen as the 'go-to' guys if you had any problem at all. As I mentioned earlier, Jethro was playing the good Samaritan and, though he didn't know it, he was on his way becoming a folk hero. \n\r\n\r\nAll was going well. \n\r\n\r\nExcept of course for Silky the Ratboy, who was nothing but a detrimental influence on their efforts to make friends and gain trust and continued to creep around town like the deranged lunatic he was growing up to be. As the weeks wore on and he spent more time away from the group, he had taken to sleeping much of the day and going out at night on his own to continue his one man rampage of creeping, angst and horror movie psycho-drama. But I will tell you of Silky's exploits at a later date. For now, let us focus on the tireless efforts of Jethro and His Little Friend.\r\n\n\r\nJust to be clear... I wasn't meaning to give them so many fairly mundane tasks (although we were actually having quite a lot of fun with them - except for the creepiness, group disruptiveness and general doing his own thing-ness from Silky). I mean yes, I had definitely planned several things around town as I did intend for them to engage with the town and grow attached to the people there, but I hadn't expected them to be quite so enthusiastically pestering people looking for things to do. I thought they might have had a few activities or goals of their own choosing that they wanted to pursue but Jethro and His Little Friend just kept visiting people and chatting with them and building a rapport. \r\n\r\nThe player of the 'Jethro's Little Friend' character is a witty guy and good at cracking jokes in character, so between his infectious humour and Jethro's general good will and positive attitude, there was no way I could justify that the various townsfolk could be anything but friendly and enjoy the company of these two. \r\n\r\nOnce they had built a rapport with whoever was the object of their attention at the time, they would start asking if there was anything at all they could help them with. If I tried to have NPC's say that really everything was fine then the pair would happily reassure them that absolutely any task was good, no matter how small or tedious. I found it hard to say no so I just had to keep coming up with random things on the spot for them to do. I didn't mind at all... that's one of my roles as gm... but as the weeks wore on (many, many hours of gaming time) I had reverted to pulling whatever crap I could think of out of the air. \r\n\r\nHowever...that isn't to say I didn't have stuff going on. \r\n\n\r\nBut we will need to skip back a bit. \r\n\r\n\nOne of the slowly growing plot threads weaving its way into the game had begun being spun just a few (in game) days after we started playing. \n\n\r\nAn unknown, very well dressed and clearly wealthy man (fine carriage, couple of bodyguards) had arrived at the town and had been spending a lot of time at the money lenders. He had stayed for a few nights at the tavern (in their best room - which wasn't to his taste) and the players had met him there. They found him cold and aloof so had generally ignored him. I believe Silky began being very offensive, clearly irritating the guy, which spurred Silky on to further offensiveness, so the guy ended up generally avoiding them until he bought and moved in to his new business/residence in the heart of the town.\r\n\r\nFrom town gossip and a little investigation they found out that he was from “Down South” and was in Oakridge because he was buying and taking over the money lending business/bank in the town. \r\n\r\nHe had basically bought the business outright - making the previous owner a very generous offer which he had accepted straight away and - not having been a local to the town in the first place – the old lender promptly left to start his business anew in one of the larger more prosperous towns down river, thinking he had got a very good deal out of the exchange and that this uppity city fool was about to find out how little business there was lending paltry sums to the folk of Oakridge. Hence the whole escorting the old money lender out of town job earlier.\n\r\n\r\nWhat the players didn't know (they had shown little interest in this rich fellow at the moment as they were far too busy helping other people) was that the man was a representative of a wealthy group of entrepreneurs and schemers and he had big plans for the town - being nestled close (ish) to a range of rocky hills, valleys, gulley’s and ravines as it was. \r\n\r\nThe wealthy man knew that there was a large silver vein in a currently unmined gulley nestled towards the foot of the mountain range, and he planned to set up a mining operation of his own. To enable him to exploit the silver vein to its maximum potential, he planned to arrange and finance construction of a series of bridges over the ravines and valleys that would allow for a road link to the as yet unmined gulley.\n\r\n\r\nHe also intended to try to purchase as much of the property in and around the town as he could so that he could, amongst other things,\r\n\n\r\na: Rent the houses to the various people he would employ to process the silver ore coming out of his mine, as well as to the miners he would employ to mine his silver  so that their families could live close by (and he could ensure he got his rent by levying it directly out of the wages of the people he employed). The miners themselves would spend much of their time in temporary shelters he would build closer to the gulley itself.\r\n\n\r\nb: Make a fortune owning the various businesses allowing him a monopoly on selling goods and services to the population of the mining town he intended to create. \r\n\r\nc: Buy up most of the local farms and then employ the locals to work on them - allowing him to control the production of food which he could then sell to the townsfolk.\n\r\n\r\nd: Set up a logging operation in the local woods and use the wood to build his mining apparatus/fuel his forges and furnaces. Also renting out yet more houses to the lumberjacks and carpenters/engineers he would employ.\r\n\n\r\ne: Buy up as much land as possible from the various families so he could build workshops, smelters and other infrastructure for his mining venture.\n\r\n\r\nSo yeah... this guy wasn't a particularly pleasant guy - he was a scheming profit driven fuckwit who was utterly absorbed with the pursuit of money who planned to turn Oakridge into a worker camp of which he would be landlord and overlord as he sought to exploit as much wealth as he could from the local - as yet undiscovered – natural resources. \n\n(I had vague imaginations that as a possible end game to this short campaign, the players might get smart to his plans, wait for him to build his bridges then find a way to either dispose of him in a tragic 'accident' and/or think up some scheme to take his mining operation and set themselves up as wealthy benefactors of the town. This had the added bonus of leaving the guy’s as yet ‘in-the-wings' shadowy business partners as potential villains seeking answers/revenge for the failure of their scheme should we ever return to a Chapter 2 of this campaign. However, as it turned out, such things were to remain wholly in the realm of my imagination, as his eventual fate was rather unpleasant and in no way lead to any sort of victory-high-five type scenario for the players. But I am getting ahead of myslef).\r\n\n\r\nBack To The Story...\n\n\r\nMany days had passed. Jethro and JLF had been busy. They were now on very good terms with about 90% of the townsfolk. \n\nThen one day, a heavy wagon rolled into town – coming down from the mountains. It was being driven by a wounded man and carried, amongst other things, his badly wounded Dwarven companion.\n\nThey had apparently been attacked by bandits on the roads to the North and had barely managed to escape with their lives. Their horses were exhausted and they were looking to seek refuge in the town for a week or two whilst they healed up and rested before continuing their journey.\r\n\n\r\nContrary to the first stranger to visit (back in part 1), this one appeared to capture the attention of the players. Well, Jethro and JLF. Silky was off somewhere doing something.  (Whatever he was doing it was undoubtedly nefarious, decidedly self-serving and most certainly creepy to some degree).\n\n\r\nIt turned out the wounded man was the owner of a logging camp in the northern woods that stretched towards the mountains and had just recently encountered some problems. \n\nHe was clearly in shock, but with some coaxing and liberal application of beverages the players learnt that he believed there was a monster loose in the woods to the North attacking his logging camp and the tree-fellers he employed. He thought that his camp must be unfortunately situated in the beasts territory and they must have recently disturbed the damn thing. They had only been logging there for the last few months but after suffering three deaths just recently (one of his workers bodies found mauled – the wounds appear to had been made by some enormous beast – two more, their bodies never found. Just large bloody smears on the trees and ground near where there were last seen working) he was deeply concerned about the safety of the site. He had employed two hunters to track and kill the beast - whatever it was - but after venturing deep into the woods neither one of the hunters was ever seen or heard from again. Bodies never found. \n\nBy this point nobody at the camp was willing to venture deep enough into the woods to even bother looking for any blood trails. \n\nHaving been quite traumatised by the whole affair – the worker that they found mauled was his younger brother – the man had decided to give up logging and head down to the larger towns or to the capital city to sell his stake in the woods. (He had a logging permit to work in the area and the deeds to a sizeable section of woodland up North).\n\r\n\r\nJethro was sympathetic, but also couldn't hide his keen interest in the logging camp and inquired as to how much the licence and deeds were worth. \n\n\r\nIt turned out they were much more than he could afford, and the man was confused as to why Jethro would want the camp anyway after hearing about the monster and string of grizzly deaths. This tale was not something the man planned to recount to potential buyers.\n\r\n\r\nStill, thought Jethro, the man was going nowhere for a week or two. He had about ten days before the tax men arrived with the King's Knights and was about to move into the end-phase of operation ‘Hearts and Minds'. \n\nHe decided to let the man rest. Jethro knew that the man and his dwarven companion would be boarding at the church and the priest there would be looking after them. The tavern owner was also helping out by preparing some of her ‘family-recipe' homebrew herbal medicines and salves for the men (well man and dwarf) which Jethro and his little friend delivered to the church for her every morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo where was I? Ah yes... the new money lender had big plans, and a fair part of his plans relied on buying up property in the town itself. The players weren't aware of this and up until the part I am about to get to, I had been unaware of Jethro and His Little Friend's overall plan (as much of their actual planning for the whole ‘goodwill mission' had taken place between game sessions privately between the players). I had no idea our plans would collide as they did. When I realised what they were up to I had to stifle a sinister chuckle.\n\r\n\r\nSo... rich bad guy wants the town. \n\n\r\nMeanwhile Jethro and His Little Friend have made friends with almost everyone and are pretty well respected and thought of as hard working, keen, trustworthy and enterprising young men with a contagious rural charm and a knack for getting things done. \n\n\r\nAnd so phase 2 of Operation ‘We Hate The Tax Man’ was set in motion.\n\n\r\nSo (I will finally get to something resembling the point – I swear), with 10 days to go before the tax men arrived and with many of the townsfolk having scraped together only a portion of the money or goods they needed, there was a sense of sombre urgency descending on the town. Only Jethro and His Little Friend remained upbeat and optimistic, with Jethro confidently reassuring the people that he had a plan and not to worry because everything would be worked out soon enough. \n\nAnd so, early one morning Jethro (with His Little Friend in tow) began his rounds...\r\n\r\n\nAfter heading to the town scribe to get the paperwork he would require, and then borrowing the scribe's quill and ink to make any amendments needed on the fly (few people could read or write in Oakridge but Jethro was fortunately one of those who could – lucky starting skill. It seemed Jethro's father had been keen to provide his son with a good education), Jethro went from house to house, farm to farm, place of business to place of business. He toured the town and outlying farms visiting every family he had worked for over the last few weeks (and even some he hadn't) and told each of them renditions of the same basic story. The basic gist was...\n\n\r\n“Everyone else has agreed to this plan and we would love it if you did too”\n\n\r\nAnd to back up his story he had fake copies of each of his important bits of paper... complete with forged signatures (or name marks - as signatures implies a level of calligraphy that simply was not present) as evidence that yes... everyone else was already on board with this plan.\r\n\n\nFor the sake of the story I will skip ahead.\n\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the next day (9 days until Doomsday), a weary Jethro and His Little Friend entered the money-lenders shop. They had been busy all day yesterday and had been up all night checking contracts and tallying amounts. \r\n\r\n\nJethro set about the crowning act of his devilishly brilliant plan. \r\n\r\n\nHe presented the paperwork to the money lender and set about outlining a proposition.\r\n\r\n\nJethro had managed, through crafty manipulation and deviously playing on his reputation of being a good, reliable, hard working and impeccably honest citizen, to get the different townsfolk to agree to his brilliant scheme of banding together and putting up the collateral for a huge loan.\n\n \r\nAnd he had done so by lying through his teeth to many of them. \n\n\r\nJethro had been telling them all, from the first to the last person visited, that everyone else was on-board and that ‘they’ were one of the last people Jethro had to come and talk to. He had used all his gathered goodwill, played on his reputation, utilised his well-nurtured friendships, lied, cunningly yet politely guilt tripped, tricked and deceived - and when required - he even showed them the collection of forged contracts and documents to prove that everyone else had already signed up and that they would be one of the few people in the community who didn't join in if they refused to sign up.\n\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't want to have to look my neighbour in the eye knowing they were bravely looking out for the livelihood of the town whilst I myself had turned my back...” etc...etc...\n\n\r\n(He chose his order of approach well, starting primarily with those he was sure could not read so as to maintain maximum plausible deniability should anyone in the future ever question the order of recruitment). \n\n\r\nHe had rallied a great many people. Even some of those who were able to pay their tithe and therefore weren't so desperate had agreed to join in – so persuasive was his performance. \n\nAnd all these people had agreed to put up many of their most valuable assets (in many cases – pretty much everything they had) as collateral on a huge loan. Yes, people had promised to back Jethro with flocks of sheep, herds of cattle and livestock, fields, orchards, barns, farms, houses, tools, wagons, horses, in some cases whole business (such as the tavern landlady, who could by now barely refuse any request from her favourite ‘son' Jethro). \r\n \n\r\nJethro had secured letters of recommendation from the various business owners in town, all written by the scribe and legitimate, stating what an honest and hard working individual Jethro Rambola was and how he was as good as his word and would be a reliable debtor. He had scribed letters of good character from various prominent townsfolk... including - in a flash of inspiration as they had escorted him out of town - the old money lender. He had a letter from the priest stating how the priest had never known a single more trustworthy and honest man, how Jethro was a credit to the town of Oakridge and stating that the priest would gladly recommend Jethro as a worthy debtor. \r\n\n\r\nAs Jethro spoke, the new money lender (the evil guy with the silver-mine plan) could barely contain his enthusiasm as all at once, the majority of property and assets in the town fell into his lap, so close and within his reach - ripe for the taking. But with a good coolness roll made he quickly regained his composure and concocted a plan of his own.\r\n\n\r\nHe listened as Jethro spoke of the peoples plight, at first remaining careful to appear aloof and dispassionate. He showed growing sympathy as Jethro laboured various stories about the hardships the good, honest, hard working folk of Oakridge have had to deal with these last few years. He allowed his face to soften as Jethro spoke about all that had been done to get people to agree to this. He nodded appreciatively as Jethro explained in tragic detail what would happen if the townsfolk could not raise their tithe in time. He almost laughed openly when Jethro all but begged the money lender to consider the collateral and honour it for a very large loan. It could be on Jethro’s head alone or, if the lender preferred (which he did), spread between the townsfolk with each having agreed to be responsible for a portion of the loan.\n\nJethro showed the lender the scribed letters he had secured. \n\nHe piled document after document on the lenders large desk.\n\n\r\nJethro, having wanted to ‘go all out' and believing it was better to offer the lender too much, rather than too little, had amassed a great deal of collateral from the various townsfolk. More than enough to cover the debt. \r\n\n\r\nThe money lender could barely contain himself as the offer was made. But he did. And playing it calmly, so that the players truly thought they had broken through the mans aloofness and reached his long buried humanity with their tales of woe and heroic efforts, rather than that they were playing directly into his hands, he accepted the deal. He spoke of how he understood that times could be hard – especially in a town recovering from the hardships of war (and bad winters) and how, although this was frankly quite unconventional, he would - in this instance - accept all the various collateral and would loan Jethro and the other townsfolk enough fresh minted and shining silver coins to pay their tithe. But he reminded them that this was at great financial risk to himself and that he would, through sheer necessity, have to enforce a strict repayment schedule that the townsfolk would need to adhere to. Much though he would like to be lenient... he simply couldn't afford to. \n\n(spoiler alert... he could).\n\r\n\r\nThe lender proposed the terms.\r\n\n\r\nThe players accepted.\r\n\r\n\nThe lender was inwardly smug – outwardly however he was a placid lake of calmness and humble tranquillity. He hadn't even mentioned the tavern incident. \n\n\r\nJethro and his little friend were exuberant. \n\n\r\nMuch drinking and celebrating was had by all as Jethro announced the success of his plan to the assembled townsfolk who – all now being in on the plan - had been packing out the tavern and surrounding fields awaiting his return from the money lenders. \n\r\n\r\nThe money lender got to play kind hearted financial saviour of the town – garnering much trust and gratitude – and Jethro got to be the brilliant genius, almost-but-not-quite-yet folk hero who had brought it all together. \n\r\n\r\nThe townsfolk were happy and the celebratory drinks and dancing and congratulatory rounds of applause and cheering for Jethro and His Little Friend lasted well into the night.\r\n\n\r\nJethro had secured a loan big enough to cover approximately Three-Quarters of the whole towns tithe. The rest could be covered by the townsfolk if they each chipped in what they had raised so far (or what they had planned to pay already in the rare instances of those who could afford to pay anyway)... but with all that, every single person in town would be covered for payment in full. \r\n\r\nThe terms were that Jethro (and the townsfolk) would spend the next year repaying this debt in full, giving them plenty of time to spread the repayments affordably as well as saving towards next years tithe. That is of course, if the harvests were significantly better this year. Which Jethro was counting on – in fact, if they weren't, he would be in some serious trouble, as would the people who had collateral listed to back the loan – but in his heart he was confident that the coming summer would be a good one.\r\nHe could feel it in his bones.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Schemer Mc Nasty Plan the two-faced money lender, began plotting and scheming like a champion scheme artist vying for gold in the first annual schemer Olympics. \n\r\n\r\nHad half the town really just offered him all their prime assets as collateral on a loan because of this country-bumpkin? All he had to do now was play it nice, create and coordinate some circumstances that would limit the townsfolks ability to pay back the loan and slowly but surely foreclose on the debts and acquire the town. \n\r\n\r\nYou may, or may not have suspected, Mr Scheme the money lender is also responsible for the ‘beast' attacking the nearby logging camp – amazing what you can do with some well paid cut-throats, some animal handlers and a couple of imported black bears (all discoverable had the players spent any time to go and look). \n\nThe logging camp represented competition to the lender's plans and he was determined to shut down the rival operation before he started his own local logging venture. If he had to, he would try to buy the loggers land straight out from under him, but he would prefer not having to pay so much. \n\nSadly his attempts to have the man killed had failed miserably so far. \n\nThe cut-throats had mistakenly killed his brother, believing it to be him - they did look similar - then disguised it as a beast attack and lead a few more real beast attacks of their own with the trained bears and animal handlers. You know, to make it look authentic. \n\r\n\r\nAll had gone to plan except they got the wrong target. \n\r\n\r\nAnd then, upon learning of the mistaken identity, the ~~bandits~~ hired-mercenaries the lender had paid to kill the man and his dwarf companion on the road as he fled the logging camp had only done half a job. \n\r\nStill, he could only assume that at least that particular group of mercs wouldn't be returning to collect the rest of their payment. \n\nBut now the man wanted to sell the logging camp. \n\nThat would only begin the lender’s problem again with a whole different group as new workers moved onto the site. And yet, he didn't want to brazenly have the men (well, man and dwarf) killed in town as any investigation may uncover his association with the deed. And he didn't want to appear too eager to buy the damn logging rights or the land because he didn't want anyone to suspect him of any foul play when the man met his eventual grizzly death. \r\n\n\r\nThe lender was a cautious schemer. \n\nHe would still get the man killed. He had an ace up his sleeve yet. A second team of well paid career-mercenaries who were waiting on the road south of town. They would ambush and finally kill the man and the dwarf once they had healed and were heading south. It wasn't likely that the man would be able to sell his logging property to anyone in the destitute town of Oakridge. \n\nThe money lender had plenty of time. He just needed to be patient and an opportunity would present itself. Or so he thought. \r\n\r\nHe hadn't counted on Jethro, who, despite being utterly oblivious to the money lenders plans or general scheme-iness - instead believing him to be a quite reserved, but deep down fairly ok chap - was by sheer coincidence destined to keep getting in the way of the money lenders plans. \n\r\n\r\nAs this game went on it was amusing for me to watch a player foil the bad guy's plans without even knowing they were doing it.\r\n\r\nBut again, I am getting ahead of myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the next day (8 Days to Doomsday)...\n\n\r\nAfter a night of celebration Jethro and His Little Friend set about their business for the day. The plan wasn't quite finished yet. \r\n\r\nThey walked to the money lenders and actually signed the loan agreement and gave the lender all the deeds and contracts to hold on to until the debt was repaid – and in return they availed themselves of a small chest full of silver pieces. They had never seen so much money in one place. It was more than enough to pay the tithe. \r\n\r\nNo, really it was.\r\n\r\nThrough some clever adjustments of peoples agreed collateral, repayments and level of debt taken on, and some general outright forgery during the night in between getting people to agree to the plan and approaching the money lender, Jethro had managed to up the loan amount a little. Just enough for him to have a small fund left over after paying the town's tithe. Not a lot. Jethro wasn't greedy or trying to ruin the townsfolk. He just saw an opportunity and took it. \n\nThe extra money was only a small extra levy on each of the colluding townsfolks debts (and Jethro had done so much for people for free). \n\nThe money lender, in his greed and eagerness to make the loan had assumed the higher-than-what-was-needed loan was simply down to Jethro being shitty at maths and he didn't mind, so he didn't question it. As far as he was concerned it just meant the monthly repayments were that little bit higher for everyone. \n\nBut it wasn't an accident. Jethro had thought it all through.\r\n\r\n\nThe small fund left over was just enough to allow Jethro to make a viable offer to the wounded man for his logging rights and land. Which he did that morning – right after leaving the lenders shop - as he delivered the medicine to the church from the tavern owner. \r\n\n\r\nThe amount of money was indeed a small portion short of the value of the land. This was done deliberately so as not to give anyone cause to suspect what he was up to... but Jethro had a plan for that too.\r\n\n\r\nThe wounded lumberjack/logging camp man, still confused as to why Jethro would want the place, obviously this simple minded but good natured country lad didn't understand the concept of ‘oh dear we have strayed into the hunting grounds of some large man eating beast', happily sold it to him for a slightly discounted value. To validate the discounted rate, Jethro had promised to avenge the man’s fallen brother by slaying the man eating beast and mounting its head above the logging camp entrance. Right below the sign that would read... \n\n\nRambola Logging Company. \r\n\n\r\nJethro's player still believed it was an actual beast killing lumberjacks in the woods and had no idea as yet that it was the scheming machinations of the money lender. He was quite looking forward to hunting whatever it was. His little friend had some good tracking skills – learnt in childhood before his dad headed off to war and never returned – and Jethro had a good axe and boundless optimism. Between the two of them (and Silky if he joined them) they were confident they could handle whatever the man-eater was. \n\r\n\r\nSo they had their chest of silver and Jethro was the proud owner of the newly created – but as yet non-functioning – Rambola Logging Company. He was one step closer to his childhood dream of being a lumberjack. \n\r\n\r\nBut the money lender wasn't done with his scheming.\n\r\n\r\nHe wanted to solidify his grip on the town. Ideally he wanted his money back too. \n\nIn a perfect world he would steal back the money before it got to the tax men – but in a way that made Jethro look incompetent (and/or to blame for its loss) in the process – leaving Master Jethro, and the town, unable to pay. The lender would then – under a pretence of heavy moral obligation – step in and pay the tithe, then declare that unfortunately the townsfolk now owed him double. Which of course, none of them would be able to afford to repay in the time allowed. The lender could give them a couple of months of futile struggle, pretending to be sympathetic, and then – obviously terribly regrettably, he would be forced to – foreclose on all debts, claiming all assets and properties. If he pulled it off right then everyone would blame Jethro and nobody would suspect it had been his plan all along – which would in turn arouse no curiosity – and so there was little chance of anyone discovering, and thus interfering with, his silver-mining plans. \r\n\n\r\nIt would be the perfect takeover. \r\n\n\r\nBut how to steal the money back whilst at the same time making Jethro look responsible for losing it? That was a tough question. And so the lender pondered upon this problem. Rigorously.\r\n\r\n\nAt one point he was toying with the idea of dressing some men up to look like tax men to come and get the payment... but it was a ludicrous idea and he knew it. He just had to wait. An opportunity would present itself. \n\nContinued in Part 2b...",

        "text": "Selben was the commander of this mission, his goal had been to establish a base of communication - then await orders from high command, at least that was what he had come up with so far. His second in command right hand man Snickers was among his crew, along with Bax and Yams both equally qualified engineers in their own ways.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA large asteroid shaped a bit like a donut comes into view, smashed into the side is a large blue ship - most of the right side appears to have been damaged in the crash, small bits of debris are spinning off into the distance. Hovering nearby surveying the damage four figures - three of them are lined up as they are given their orders from the single figure - Captain Selben.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n'Star-date… Uh Saturday… The crew and I have been stranded on this cursed rock, it looks like only four of us have managed to survive the crash. I have begun to order out the survivors into different assignments so we can attempt to rebuild our…'\n\n**Belch!**\n\n‘WTF Snickers?! I’m trying to create a captains-log here!’ - Mocked Selben trying to stay in character.\n\n*Giggles can be heard over the voice-chat*\n\n‘He said he was creating a “Captains-LOG”’… Snickers and Bax both giggled madly, even Selben laughed at their terrible joke.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter things settled down a bit Selben made another attempt at their role-playing scenario in Space Engineers. They had finally managed to all relatively stay connected to the multi-player server, the game was still fairly new - and very much in alpha. Getting back into character Selben turned back to his group, one of them was now upside down - but still in line.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‘As I was saying… We need to salvage together what we can and get our ship operational!’\n\nBax spoke - ‘Um, where are we going?’\n\nSelben paused - he had not actually made a plan… ‘The Moon!’\n\nThe other spoke in unison ‘THE MOOOOON!’\n\n‘That was creepy guys, now make me a moon lander!’ Selben said with authority!\n\nThey all scrambled off in different directions, the sounds of grinders and bits being pieced back together could be heard for the next few minutes.\n\n‘Hey Selben?’ - Bax’s voice could be heard.\n\n‘Yes?’ - he replied\n\n‘We have a slight issue… I we don’t have all the components to build the ship.’\n\nSelben thought for a moment - ‘Then mine them, you and Yams work on building a small mining ship - Snickers and I will continue dismantling the unnecessary parts of the big ship.’\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings appeared to be going well, the majority of the ship had been stripped leaving only a platform with the bare items needed, Yams had created a docking port on the platform so they could unload the mining vessel. Next to it was the base shell for the new lander - Snickers continued building but it was a slow process without a welding ship, so Selben began working on that himself. The hum of the refinery and the sight of the Moon, their goal in the distance getting closer and closer with every piece put together pulling them closer to the final goal felt productive until Bax came in to dock up with the main ship and disaster struck…\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWithout warning the small miner with Bax inside began to twitch and rubber-band madly - making the terrifying cries of ‘Lord Klang’ Bax shouted for help, everyone came zipping over with their jet-packs but all they could do was watch in horror. Bax ejected himself and tried to fly away but the ship shook violently like a possessed Chihuahua and it smacked him, he died instantly - the others backed up, but the jittering ship wasn’t done yet - it began to move towards the large reactor on the platform, it was their main source of power and had to be stopped. Snickers jumped into the pilot seat of the crazed mining ship but to no avail, and when he jumped out he was also killed. Selben having no choice jumped into the cockpit of his half built welding ship and flew it straight into the demonic mining ship - as it impacted the miner shot off into the distance like an angry rocket.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLuckily the medical station had a clone facility and both Snickers and Bax were back, seemingly unharmed - except for the mental damage, especially in Bax. The welding ship needed a few repairs but otherwise did fairly well considering. They ended up building another two miners - and completing the welding ship - progress was moving quickly but again disaster struck. As Bax was pulling in to unload his cargo, he had too much mass and smashed into the connector - all the contents of his connector exploded out, massive chunks of precious metals and rock spewed all over the small station, one of the rocks smashed into Selben, killing him instantly. The crew was so devastated they all had to take a moment to laugh for at least two minutes - before rebuilding the medical bay which had also been destroyed by the debris.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter several more hours, they finally had produced a large lander - they made a few attempts to attach the smaller ships but that seemed to be causing some major issues, so they were abandoned. They all climbed into the ship and set off towards their goal… The moon! The ship reached its top speed of apparently 100 and they turned off the dampeners to save fuel, the vessel majestically moved through space - gliding silently along. Unfortunately boredom quickly overtook the crew…\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Farting noises could be heard over the intercoms, followed by giggles*\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBax spoke ‘How long will this take?’\n\nSelben responded ‘I’m not too sure, never went to the moon before… They just put in planets, none of us have been there yet!’\n\nBax spoke again ‘I’m gonna stretch my legs - AFK... Er I mean - Entering Cryosleep!’\n\nAs soon as Bax left, the ship entered the gravitational pull of the moon!\n\nSelben jumped back into character - ‘Snickers, keep an eye on the horizon - prepare to use afterburners to slow our decent! Yams - can you confirm all gear is stowed?’\n\nSnickers replied in character ‘Affirmative, preparing to level her out!’\n\n‘Confirmed we are set for decent!’ Answered Yams.\n\nThe ship got closer and closer but something was wrong… It wasn’t slowing down…\n\n‘This doesn’t look good’ warned Snickers.\n\n‘Prepare for impact!’ Shouted Selben!\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe ship smashed into the planets surface, thanks to the amazing strength of steel plates or coding? The ship bounced… Then hit another side and started spinning, then another and slowly broke apart. Everyone survived the crash, but Bax was not replying - they searched around the wreckage but he was nowhere to be seen. They were now missing a crew member and trapped on the surface of the moon without means to escape.",

        "text": "So I made a mistake. My first time DMing and I did it for a goblin campaign with my dumb friends. Being equally dumb, Im the one who came up with the idea for a goblin campaign. \n\nWe had the Mighty Takk, the strong goblin who liked to bite and who was the village idiot. The village idiot amongst a bunch of goblins mind you. There was the paranoid Klek, who rode a large chameleon before I had it disintegrated and replaced it with a wereboar. Urgh the man-queen of the goblins who found an oversized gun. And then there was Terknup, the charismatic bard (Whose player actually made up many different goblin songs on his own, kudos) who was the first of the group to realize that people would pay them for doing nice things. \n\nThere were a lot of ^^^Mis Adventures. Im new at Dming, so I played really loose and made up my own story half the time. If it was funny then I usually tried going for that. For instance, they ended up killing a kid playing in cardboard armor, because they thought he was a knight in golden armor. They didnt feel guilty, just hungry after. The time I just ended up giving Takk an Idiot Savant trait, because he got so many nat 20s on untrained knowledge checks. And the time Klek was actually right about the cause of the trouble being a murder cult. He still hasnt let us forget.\n\nAnyway, we finished our current campaign so we're taking a little break. This being our last adventure in a while, I made a nice little epilogue that was somewhat ruined by Terknup announcing something to their main quest giver, The Fool. You see, Terknup had made the joke months back that he collected trophies from every enemy they slew. What would a goblin take as a trophy? The balls, of course it was the balls. No matter the enemy. Daemon? Balls. Harpy? Balls? Tree monster? Acorns. \n\nI thought it was a throw away gag. I was proven ever so wrong. After \"finishing\" their main quest (The hostages they were supposed to save were melted by an exploding alchemical golem), Terknup presented to the Fool a large bag. My friend playing Terknup happily exclaimed that he knew the rest of us probably forgot, but he remembered the entire time. Even when he went on vacation to Iceland, he was thinking of this. He proceeded to name every single creature we had fought up to this point and how many testicles they dropped. He had a google doc that he showed us, he did the work. They were level 7 at this point, so imagine the amount of things I threw at them. \n\nAfter giving up his bag, he quickly asked for it back. I dont know what this Bard is going to do with a sack of dozens of pairs of balls, but I'm terrified for the next time I have to DM for their goblin campaign.",

        "text": "This is the tale of my first session with an old group, earlier this evening. The group are all old friends - I GM'd for them at one point, and dropped out after personal life got in the way. Came back as they returned from intermission on another campaign.\n\nSetting the stage, with renaming for convenience (I don't remember the other names, mostly).\n\nFreshman: a male 14-year old force sensitive zabrak (horns in head/Darth Maul) played by a boisterous friend who's greatest joy in life is breaking games. Mostly jumps around a bunch and breaks the force powers. Pretty obnoxious and acts like he's older than he is (as part of the character).\n\nSquidward: a 15-year-old Nautilan (Kit Fisto/tentacle-headed guys) with a big sword and lots of body armor. Our tank. As elegant and effective as a brick wall.\n\nEdgelord: Our 17 year old male mirialan (green skin humanoid), who wears a rebreather mask and enjoys sniping, but doesn't have much in the way of a personality. Reminds me of what I'd imagine a 17-year-old Boba Fett would be like.\n\nVirgin: 16 year old human boy, quiet, without much to show so far in the campaign due to awkward skill placement. Played by the meeker member of our group.\n\nAnd myself, as Cassie: an 18-year-old female Zabrak. Scavenger. Thrill-seeker. Sarcastic teenager. \n\nNon-combatant, puckish rogue, and thief with agility/freerunning experience. Based on a character I've played in other RP games, which is based on a character written by someone I used to play with. Never with this group though. I have more experience playing this character than most of these guys have RPing. Nobody else has any idea.\n\nI joined the campaign late, as everyone else was just coming back from a one-month hiatus (school finals, etc.) but forgot to allocate the extra experience that would help me compensate for everyone else being about 4 sessions up on me. Oops.\n\nI also joined thinking I would be the *youngest* character of the group. Nope. For reference: we're all grown-ass men, now pretending to be teenagers. Uh, yeah. This will end well.\n\nAs soon as play starts, I spot the problem. Freshman, played by the player that he is, has already broken the game. If you're unaware, force powers in force and destiny don't really have a resource pool once unlocked - if there is, we're unaware of it. It comes down to dice rolls, and there's really only \"success\" and \"better success.\"\n\nHaving rushed the ability to force jump, the combat scenarioes come down to our sniper forcing the target to cover, and Freshman flushing him out by literally crossing 60-80 feet every set of turns (with a turn cycle being about 10-15 seconds of in game time). Yeah. Problem. Nobody gets to showboat but me.\n\nI join the group as they're training in a Jedi temple, having recovered two of the three holocrons to restore it. The third holocron was stolen by a local crime syndicate - and sold to the corruptish mayor of the nearby town, who has it stored in a private section of the museum (I'd rather not share how long it took us to figure that tidbit out).\n\nAlthough we're presented with the option of enlisting the help of the local crime lord to steal it back (so he can then resell it again), none of us are too enthused about the idea. And it's weird. The guy is quite pleasant to speak to and hasn't made threats. His men are even well behaved. Go figure.\n\nInstead, we try virtually *everything* else. We visit the museum (attached to the university). Guards ask for imperial papers. We try to force our way around under the pretense of being studying students. Guards ask for imperial papers. We try to visit the mayor. Appointment only. Or imperial papers. We return to the gang-lord to try and purchase some imperial papers. No dice - but his offer to just, y'know, help us get into the museum (in exchange for picking up some extra treasure for him) is still open!\n\nAnd, interestingly, there's also another option... a cell within the organization. Rebel sympathizers. They want to talk to us about doing it \"for the cause\" or whatever-the-hell.\n\nWorth noting that nobody's really talked about *why* we didn't take that guy's offer. He'd never given us a reason to distrust him, like, at all, and was offering an open hand. But nah. My group decides to go for the rebels instead. For... some reason. Whatever. I wouldn't have recommended it, but I was never a part of the conversations - I was chasing down my own leads (stories of their own) and ended up with nothing for it. Got a few good quips from the character though. She's lovably sarcastic.\n\nAnyways, a full day of chasing down different leads (no dice) and Freshman continuing to dictate the course of play (not his fault - he and I were the only ones driving plot progression), and it's clear that the GM is really gunning for us to take one of his two pre-planned options.\n\nIn his defense, I think this was a pre-planned campaign - like a book or something. In either case, he'd clearly spent a lot of time on it. Still, stories need to be flexible. Out of character, I'd never been a part of the conversations, so I kept my mouth shut about, y'know, just trusting the gang-lord.\n\nIn-character, Cassie would never have cut a deal with him in the first place - and so the shenanigans begin.\n\nThat evening, I formulate my plan. I need to out-showboat Freshman at this point. It's a matter of personal honor, and asserting my place in the game. Or something. Mostly I just thought it was a fun idea.\n\nMy shopping list:\n\n* 4 cloaks, sewn together - henceforth known as parachute\n* 2 large batteries - for overloading security later\n* A length of rope - for attaching the parachute\n* A tool kit (which I completely forgot)\n* And the ability to convince our pilot (GM's NPC) that we were not completely insane.\n\nAfter all, when I cased the building, it might've been grappling-hook friendly...\n\nBut why just go buy a grappling hook, when you can skydive, instead?\n\nThe meeting with the rebel sympathizer finally comes (we've been playing for 4 hours with virtually no plot development otherwise) and he reveals that he would *like* to trust us... but we've gotta run errands for him, first.\n\nI shit you not, after four hours of us exploring every possible lead into the museum, instead of just taking us there, this guy produces 3 small dead-drops to be taken around the city.\n\nABSOLUTELY NOT.\n\nCassie wasn't super thrilled about the idea regardless. A bunch of force-sensitive kids, literally just escaping from a jedi academy that'd been massacred by Vader himself, suddenly making themselves enemies of the empire?\n\nWell, Cassie's known these guys for like, two days. She ain't about to become public enemy number 1 for them.\n\nEdgelord, Freshman and Virgin each take a box, and they're on their way. I've turned and left before the encounter is even finished - I did not sit here for four hours to do a fetchquest for some NPC.\n\nSquidward joins me, being the odd man out for the campaign. And then I ask him: want to do something *really* fun?\n\nCobbling together a last-minute harness, we check our supplies (forgetting the tools), Squidward removes his heavy armor at my insistence (I'd be surprised if this cobbled-together parachute supports *my* weight, nevermind his AND the armor's) and the pilot, asking for our last words, drops us.\n\nImmediately, things go wrong. Saved from certain doom only by a triumph in my pool of failed rolls, one of the two straps holding Squidward to Cassie snaps, throwing us off-kilter and towards certain doom. Luckily, a quick strength check allowed him to grab on, and a few coordination rolls and we're back on track.\n\nThe parachute deploys above us. So far, so good. Mostly. With a high vigilance/whatever the stat is for resolution, Squidward is utterly unaffected by his near-death experience, Cassie screaming to the sky as we descend:\n\n\"WE WILL BE LEGENDS FOR THIS!\"\n\n(yes it was actually shouted, what do you take me for?)\n\nWe land on the roof with little trouble - Cassie being specced for high coordination and athletics, Squidward never even needs to roll. The landing is light as a feather.\n\nUnfortunately, our luck runs out. Some pathetically failed perception checks later, we're only able to find a pair of human-sized vents, rather than the rooftop access we were hoping for.\n\nAnd, detaching ourselves from the parachute, we investigate the covers.\n\nBolted.\n\nNo screwdriver.\n\n(Fortunately, we had a light-side point left from our pool earlier in the game - a very limited resource pool for the players to spend, to remember things they forgot - like tools - and other deus ex machina. Unfortunately, it's now a completely dark-side pool. Meaning that the GM is about to make myself and Squidward's respective lives hell.)\n\nWith a few more COMPLETELY FAILED checks in the vents (I used up all my luck by surviving the parachute, I guess), now we're frozen to silence, Cassie swearing like a sailor after bumping her knee on something.\n\nBehind her is the biggest tank of a man in the party.\n\nWith no stealth stats. Or coordination. Or perception. Or his armor.\n\nThat's where we ended tonight's session, as the others finished their fetchquest. A rousing success for my first play with this character... but for our next session, I think [the actions of Jason Momoa say it best.](http://i.imgur.com/ugloFTE.mp4)",

        "text": "Kane: If Groot fell to Khorne you'd get this guy. The only thing he says is 'I kill'. It's also the thing he likes to do most. Kinda insane. Part of my mercenary group.\n\nHorus: Playing a regular mercenary.\n\nOne fine afternoon my mercenary group was just hanging around in camp. Since the last battle had been early in the morning and there really wasn't anything else to do Kane was getting a bit antsy. The problem with him is, that he's pretty crazy and really doesn't care much who he kills. Since we didn't feel like chaining him up and we had heard that one of our allied factions would go into battle soon lots were drawn and I ended up going with him to see if we could find him some stuff to kill.\n\nWe left any parts of our armors that could show people our actual allegiance in our camp and just ended up mixing in with our ally's army. Both of us were in pretty shitty basic armor, so no one noticed us when we marched with them.\n\nThe battle turned pretty chaotic pretty fast and I ended up loosing sight of Kane pretty quickly. Since the whole thing wasn't looking good for our side and I really didn't feel like dying I decided to get out when I couldn't find him. I managed to make it out and to a medic with no incident, but when I got back to our camp without Kane, the rest of the group started to get nervous.\n\nKane showed up an hour or so later and started telling – well, with lots of pointing, gesturing and voicework – us a funny little tale of trolling. \n\nAfter we got separated he had kept on fighting until someone shot him. He went down close to the gate of the camp our allies were attacking and since he had nothing on his armor that indicated his allegiance, the other guys' medics pulled him out. And for some reason they forgot to take his sword away.\n\nNormally the healers stay in the back of the battle with a bunch of fighters who make sure no one attacks them. If you end up with the healers during a battle it's also normal protocol for these guys to disarm you. Killing healers is normally frowned upon, so sometimes these things aren't taken very seriously.\n\nKane didn't care about all this. When the healers asked him about his wounds he told them 'I Kill', pointed a bit and managed to convey that he had been shot twice. He got patched up and was told to rest a bit. Kane did just that.\n\nThen he got up and started murdering the medics. From what we could understand he got quite a few guys before the guards could react and take him down.\n\nThe commander of our allies caught quite a bit of crap for this, since pretty much anyone who isn't Chaos or Orks keeps his hands off of enemy medics. Some of the crap came from the commander of our own army.\n\nThe funniest thing about all of this?\n\nWe are with the Paladin-y lawful-good fraction. No one will ever suspect it was one of our guys who went full murder hobo.",

        "text": "Sorry it has taken so long to get this part up, Life has been rather busy/interesting lately so Ive been stuck on other things. \n\nso the ongoing adventures of Salad the Necromancer\nPart 6: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/66e4dy/pathfinder_salad_the_necromancer_and_unsupervised/\n\nPart 1 (with character intros): https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5m7ymg/salad_the_necromancer_and_the_paladin_of_the_rcmp/\n\n\nSo! we left off as the party had just finished the China arc! and we had a stretch of a month of unsupervised downtime.... so Salad began earnestly working on his big project- he wanted to start by using the bones of the void-yai, and to acquire that I needed to diplomance with the King of Hell himself.... and I couldnt exactly go \"hey paladin I want the bones of the void yai can you talk to Yama for me?\" sooooo I got to roll...  Thankfully I have a decent cha stat and a couple points into it and rolled a 19 and a 20 on the 2 checks, so I got what I needed, The Dm and I worked out I needed only 11 days or so to finish the project so I was able the spend the rest of the time enhancing his project... and the other party members did stuff with their downtime too (mostly magical crafting) I was able to earn a single boon of the immortals... a scroll of permanent telepathic bond....\n_________________________________________________________\n\nAfter the month passes we all meet up and prepare to leave, we exit Beijing with a procession of China's great and powerful following us we say our goodbye's and prepare to depart, when a strong gust of wind blows in our direction... and the faint scent of.... Lavender? yup! a month means lots of things a Necro... I mean wizard... can do! a huge Dragonlike form, 32' long, made predominantly of bones so dark they seem to eat light, accented with more traditional bone colourings, glowing crystal eyes, runes carves across its body, swoops down and lands in front of the party, paws at the ground and leans down, almost bowing before Salad/me, who then hops up into the finely crafted saddle on its back.\n\nThis whole time the Paladin has been sword out ready to stab but I convince him to hold off on that... I mean who could hate Fluffy! \nat this the dragon kinda bounces around a bit like a dog. You see I still had a big supply of that Yao grass, and I mean multiple bales of the stuff- I had talked to the DM and he allowed me to use almost all of it (I had just enough left over to upgrade my headband a bit) to use in all the stitching and bindings on the Dragon (which is actually a Huge size necrocraft with upgrades like Fly, Extra move, cannibal  and mostly skeleton if I remember right and some magic items built right into it to upgrade movement, and power) and probably a small portion of my soul to grant it intelligence akin to that of a really smart dog or wolf  (Int 3) which happens to be the threshold for... you got it! Permanent telepathic bond!\n\n We discussed our options and decided that flying above Mongolia to get to Russia was definitely a better option than trying to trek across it, so we set out... though the paladin refused to ride on fluffy, as did the Valkyrie- they used the Valk/Summoner's Eidolon to carry them- well the paladin wore it then just carried the valkyrie... they slowed us down a lot, and it was probably a lot less comfortable than on the finely crafted leather seats on Fluffy, fine wine was poured, snacks were had. but we did cross Mongolia without incident eventually finding a space near the black forest to land, I reduce Fluffy with carry companion and we set off towards the sleepy little Russian village where our contact is supposed to meet us\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWe arrive at the Village early into the evening and are greeted with suspicious looks, a couple men approach us, with who appears to be the Village Earldoman asking what we want, we told them we were here to see Maxim (our contact's name) and he told us Maxim has been missing near on 6 months now (about the time the party spent in China... well damn) and whats worse, more and more people went missing over the months, something, most likely wolves were taking them- people would board themselves up in their houses at night, yet that didnt always save them, Children especially were being taken.. what's more they were expecting another visit tonight.\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWe did like any good heroes would do and planned, we got everyone to town hall and began fortifying it, The elemental and inquisitor would stay inside to protect the people, the Valk would stay on the roof with Left and Right (my last two skeletons) the Paladin would Patrol outside with his Axe handle hounds and I would ride Fluffy into battle!\n\n\ninside the church we were discussing the plan with the Earldoman  and the paladin decides to release his hounds from carry companion, this unnerves the Villagers a tiny bit, but the friendliness of the big hounds and the Paladin's aura of courage keeps them from freaking out, at this point I decides that hey.... maybe I should warn them about fluffy, as he is a bit more.... striking, than the hounds, although just as friendly! \nso I ask the Earldoman to come outside, and probably the Paladin too with his fear reducing aura, so out we go into the village's main open area, and I place Fluffy down and dispel the Carry companion, He expands out to his full huge size, rears back, stretches his wings, the area around him and Salad seems to darken as if a curtain has been placed around it, and the Earldoman makes a will save... he stands his ground, we are pretty sure his pants are a bit damper but he stays, lets us know he is very thankful we are on their side and promises to keep the villagers inside and that a lot of the strange noises will be on our side.\n_________________________________________________________\n\nPatrolling the area is boring but I keep fluffy's head low so its not seen from outiside the village as easily, we are in the main plaza area when the hounds get the sent of something and shoot off to behind the town hall, with the paladin flying behind (glowing like daylight as he goes) he finds the hounds pinning down a man, shirtless and struggling, he says that there are many more of them and that he cant stop them from taking the people of the village, and begins to change, lifting the hounds up a bit, The paladin sees this and weighs killing this man vs the lives of the villagers, when he hears something\n\n_________________________________________________________\nSalad was reading on the back of fluffy who was keeping an eye out for things (due to his crystal eyes, he has at least as good a perception check as Salad himself, I think a few points better) when Fluffy hear something, He snakes his head around a building and comes face to face with another shirtless man, who looks a bit scared and says \"oh... we were not expecting dragon....\" to which Fluffy roars at full volume in his face, and goes to bite him, ROLL INITIATIVE!\n_________________________________________________________\n\nIt's this that the Paladin hears, and seeing the man begin to shake off his hounds he decides the right thing to do is to kill him before innocents can be harmed. So he coup de grace's him, and runs back towards the fight, where The valkyrie, left and right are firing arrows everywhere into the oncoming werewolves, there was at least a dozen of them, many swarming around Fluffy and Salad as they laid about them with Claw and Fire, causing werewolves to double over in pain from howling agony, capturing them in webs, biting them into pieces, the Paladin charges in and smites evil, absolutely wrecking one of the larger more intimidating werewolves, causing the remainders to try and flee, only to find themselves blocked in by a towering wall of ice cast by the Valkyrie. so we capture them, keep them separated to the side chained up as we interrogate them one by one, asking the same/similar questions who sent you? why? whats the history of the werewolves in the area? who's your leaders? I let Fluffy happily munch on some corpses to recover health while we interrogate, which between that, Interrogate spells, Howling agony and the fact we kicked their buts they all eventually spill the beans, we find that there is a werewolf village deep in the forest, This whole thing happened ~8 months ago starting with one hunter, who unintentionally infected others, the original hunter saw it as a curse but many of the werewolves now see it as a gift and they wish to a) come get their families and make them werewolves and b) carve out a werewolf nation and forcibly turn others into werewolves\nthis werewolf curse is a bit different because they have control over the change (for the most part) and can exist in 3 forms, Human, Werewolf and full wolf. They have a couple leaders back at the village, split along the lines of Pacifist (led by Maxim) and Aggressive (led by Sergei i think?) we tie up our friends and Fluffy carries them as we set off towards their village after a short rest. \n_________________________________________________________\n\nWe reach the location of the village and dump the raiders right in the middle of it, maybe it was a bit much swagger but we just beat up a dozen of them, how many more could there be? *hint we didnt think to ask how many of them were there*\n\nSo about a hundred werewolves surrounding us later we are talking with Sergei and Maxim, Maxim manages to keep it from reaching bloodshed and he invites us to stay with him at his house, one of the few houses not built high in the trees. while there we discuss Baba Yaga's influence, the nature of the curse (a magical disease, not sure the origin) how many villages have been empty and strange happenings wiping our villages/towns to the north, we decide that is where we will set out, but first we have an idea... we ask Maxim if there is anyone who would want the curse lifted, he brings us a wolf pup, apparently the babies have a hard time controlling the change and usually are in wolf form till they are 6 or 7\n\nIn an unusual display of light and dark, Salad the Necromancer and Micheal the Paladin work together to try a lift the curse, Salad using dispel magic to try and suppress the magical half Micheal using lay on hands to remove the disease, we managed to not remove the curse entirely but stop it from working for a time (we dont know how long) This truly gave Maxim hope... we ate and in the morning we would set out Northward.",

        "text": "This is Part one of a Call of Cthulhu adventure written from the perspective of my character, Dimitri Yezhov, agent of the NKVD (Narodnyi Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del, the agency for internal affairs of the USSR). Dimitri was ordered to aid the Infantry Squad 36 of the Red Army, during a special mission to retrieve a T-34, to whom the higher ups had lost contact.\n\nThe Squad is also tasked with finding and retrieving an unknown artifact, which the Germans are looking for in the area, as well as eliminating any German forces they might encounter.\n\n****\n\n**Day 0:**\n\nWe left the Winter camp on an armored troop transport, Kapitan Michael Popov, our new superior ordered us to dismount roughly 20km outside of Burnash. The weather is awful, it's seems like this blizzard will never end.\n\nThe Kapitan just stopped, we're moving up...\n\nHe is dead. When we reached him he was already cold, killed by an elk trap. There was nothing we could do. After contemplating the rank of each member we settled on me as the new leader, I'll keep my disguise up for now thought. I took relevant mission data and the radio from Popov and buried him in the snow. Wildlife is the last thing we want to attract during this weather.\n\nWe dispersed the weapons and ammunition under each other and continued towards Burnash. Wassilli was particularly skilled at navigating and I trust him to find the right way.\n\nThe Weather is getting worse, we took shelter under an overhang for the moment. We'll proceed in the morning.\n\n**Day 1:**\n\nIt feels like it's only getting colder, at least the blizzard stopped and it's only lightly snowing now. At this pace we'll reach Burnash in the night.\n\nWe've stopped again, seems like a pack of wolves followed us. Let's see if they will retreat. I've advised the men to conserve ammunition.\n\nThey attacked. A total of 5 wolves, one being unmistakably the alpha. I shot him before he had a chance to attack and the others took care of the rest. One wolf limped away, but it will surely not bother us again. Mortusk mentioned that we could cut up the dead wolves for food. He got shut down quickly, but I must admit, the rations are already running low.\n\nI radioed in to base camp and told them about the death of Popov, now that the storm is over. They were not amused, obviously, and told me to continue the mission without further losses. Primary target is the the T-34, I tried establishing radio contact but only received static...\n\n**Day: 3**\n\nWe entered Burnash. Well what's left of it anyways... Seems like the Nazi's came here first and shot everyone. Bodies were littering the streets and all the buildings were burned down. After searching the area we found a hidden basement with some potatoes. they should last us two more days... Afterwards we buried the dead.\n\nI decided to set up camp in the basement for now as we wont reach the tanks last known position within a day and the weather is getting worse again. Everyone agreed.\n\n**Day 4:**\n\nWhen we woke up, Mortusk hat a spot of blood on his lips, but had no wound from which it could have come, and no other source of blood could be found. Keeping this was in my mind for now...\n\nWe moved out towards the Tank. I radioed in to base camp again. All they want to hear about is the Tank... that's the military for you, no empathy for fallen Russians whatsoever.\n\nWe've reached the Tank, it's looking bad there is a gigantic hole in the side armor and I can see two bodies lying in the snow. I ordered Wassilli to set up the MG and cover our approach. Nikolai and Mortusk pushed forward with me while Alexej stayed behind with Wassilli.\n\nThe Tank crew got slaughtered... The commander looked crushed like he got run over with his own tank and the driver was lying everywhere in pieces. I have never seen such gruesome death in all my life. Nikolai informed me that a third soldier could be found inside of the tank, pistol missing and with a hole in his chest similar to the one in the tank armor.\nHis uniform identified him as the gunner.\n\nWassilli and Alexej moved up and we started repairing what was left of the tank. It seems like all but the armor was mostly intact and soon we had it up and running again. Base camp was glad we could recover it but advised us to continue towards secondary goal: Recover the Artifact.\n\nWassilli mentioned that there was no trace of the fourth crewman. I assume he ran off.\n\nWe drove towards Ushatusk next. The small village should provide enough shelter for us. Hopefully the Nazi's hadn't found it yet.\n\nWe reached Ushatusk at dusk, when the villager saw us arriving they fled into their houses. We decided to play the national anthem from the tanks speakers and attached our flag onto the main barrel. It was of no use regarding the villagers, but at least it heightened morale in the Squad!\n\nNo one opened their doors, when we asked to stay for one night. Most didn't even answer so we helped ourselves inside. After some interrogation we were informed that people went missing from the village during the last weeks. People seem scared.\n\nI broke down the door to the house of on particular resistant individual. Turns out he is the local huntsman and has plenty of food stored in his basement. I informed him of the Army's thankfulness and made a mental note to send him a letter from our great leader as soon as I'm back in Moscow. That's when I realized he had a particular accent that sounded awfully close to German.\n\nI let Nikolai interrogate him, but got nothing new out of him other than the usual gist we already knew through the villagers.\n\nI took him back inside, and started conversion with him in German. At first he was shocked and suspicious, but when I showed him my agency ID and made clear that I would reward cooperation accordingly he started talking. Seems like a fellow villager, Yuri, has been acting quite suspicious for the last few weeks, leaving the village at night towards the north and generally keeping to himself. We will investigate it in them morning.\n\nAfter interrogating the Villager I was suddenly attacked by Mortusk. He must have eavesdropped and got suspicious of my impeccable German. I decided to reveal my identity and not kill him due to my orders to keep everyone alive. He will, no doubt, face charges for betraying a higher up after we finished the mission. Till then I'll keep an eye out for him...\n\n****\n\nIf People are interested I will upload the continuation of this Story as soon as possible, this was all we managed to achieve in session one last Weekend :)",

        "text": "After GM-ing for a long, long time, I finally have the chance to play in a campaign (D&amp;D 5e)--which means I get to trot out a character concept I've been sitting on for a long, long time: basically, my entire personality is secretly a long con against my fellow players. Phase 1 is working perfectly so far, and I'm having a *ton* of fun doing it, so I thought I'd write out the story here.\n\nTwo sessions in, and my character has already picked up the nickname \"Princess,\" hence, that's what I'll be calling her. *All according to keikaku...*\n\nBut first, we need to lay some groundwork...\n\n-------------------------\n\n*The Con:* \n\nPrincess is a youngish Healing Cleric of the setting-specific Sun Goddess. She's pretty, but also stuck-up, prissy, self-righteous, and a *bit* of a drama queen. She fights, if you call it that, with a delicate, ceremonial staff, but is content to buff the party and stay on the back lines. Finally, she is *exceptionally* charming, and loves to talk circles around others when she can.\n\nHowever: Princess has a secret. You see, this entire shtick is an act. Despite her purposely frail, delicate image, she has a sharp mind, an iron will, and a steel spine. But, more importantly, she is actually a heretic: she believes, honestly and completely, in doctrine her temple has decreed blasphemous. Thus, though she appears to be a pacifistic Healing Cleric of the Sun Goddess, she is *actually* a War Cleric, skilled in the arts of combat. She's adopted the delicate, whiny \"Princess\" persona to try and hide the fact that, if she ever let her true feelings be known, she would instantly make some *very* dangerous enemies. \n\nThe nature of Princess's heresy is somewhat setting-specific, but here's the gist: Princess believes with all her heart that the benevolent Sun Goddess is the same person as the evil War Goddess, a belief declared high blasphemy by the Sun Goddess's temple. Thus, though she appears to be a dedicated, fervent supporter of the Sun Goddess, she is actually devoted to both the Sun Goddess and her worst enemy in equal measure (Something like if she worshipped both Athena [wisdom, fertility, strategic warfare] and Ares [brutal, bloody, senseless warfare], but saw no contradiction in doing so). This deception works fairly well in-game, as certain abilities of the Healing and War Clerics overlap (especially their ability to both wear heavy armor).\n\n[](/raritea-r \"If you've been following some of my previous threads closely, you may have already guessed that we're playing Ponyfinder. Princess is actually named Radiance, and she is a white, Gem Pony (=Crystal) unicorn--basically Rarity in armor, for both good and bad. She serves both the Sun Queen (~=Celestia) and Blaze (~=Daybreaker) equally.\")\n[](/sp)\n\n---------------------------------\n\n*The Switch:*\n\n\nPrincess can only keep up the charade for so long. Though little bits of her spine show through every so often, she's eventually going to out herself to the group. \n\nThe (GM-approved) plan is as follows:\n\nIn another level or two, the party is going to get into *serious* trouble in the middle of combat. Princess will initially be(/act?) frightened, but, as her friends start to drop, she's going to light a fire in her eyes, set her jaw, and step right into the middle of things. \n\nIf the dice cooperate, Princess is going to open up an industrial-strength can of *whoopass*. She's going to tap into all her combat-oriented abilities she's hoping no one will notice, slinging War God's Blessings at everyone and using the extra attack from War Cleric to smash anyone who comes near. Most importantly--her delicate ceremonial staff is actually solid steel, and, when she swings it, she *breaks bones.*\n\nAfterwards, Princess is going to spill her guts: yes, she's actually a War Cleric. Yes, she worships not only the good Sun Goddess, but also the evil War Goddess--but she's not that bad, really! And yes, that *technically* makes her a heretic.\n\n\"And oh, by the way,\" she'll add, \"this means that we're probably going to have to deal with some Inquisitors before we're done. And they're, uh... not kind to heretics like myself.\"\n\n------------------------------\n\nI've already had a *ton* of fun playing as Princess, and I hope to keep doing so *at least* until I reveal her secret. I'm going to keep posting her story here, starting soon. I hope you guys enjoy Princess as much as I have so far!\n\n*Next up: Princess Bamboozles The Cops, or, \"You're doing really good at being obnoxious.\"*\n",

It's a 6 player game and we all had mission cards relating to conquering two continents, except for one guy, who'll be referred to as Wilfred, who drew a blank card but didn't declare that.\n\nAnyway, after a couple hours we'd descended into the realm of \"hang the rules\" and basically let treaties allow almost anything (military alliances and such) and the price of breaking these treaties was losing 5 countries to the person you'd betrayed, and at this point in the game it would win the person the game. \n\nWilfred made treaties with everyone and then left forces in all border countries, thus causing an effective stalemate, at which point I joke \"shame there's no world peace mission card!\" And Wilfred takes a pen, his blank card, and a shit eating grin and writes \"achieve world peace\" on his card, winning the game.

        "author": "Jolom",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6hx54l/the_misadventures_of_trith_part_4_or_trith_is/",
        "text": "So when we last left off, Trith had just suplexed a mercenary who wanted to hire him to help massacre a bunch of civilians so other people could sneak into a church.  While getting the drop on the merc made the start of the fight go well for him, Trith had failed to notice that the mercenary was not without backup, and soon Trith found himself fighting off two large men who, quite frankly, were better at CQC than Trith (Trith had abysmal Dex, and was out of his armor making it so he had a sub-10 AC, while his opponents were in studded leather.)  After getting the shit kicked out of him the two mercenaries left him alive out of professional courtesy but also warned Trith that if he interfered with the attack they would have no problems killing him. \n\nNow having to decide what to do, Trith weighed his options.  He could continue to live and just book it, leaving his comrades to possibly die at the hands of these vile men but living to find and kill his arch nemesis, or he could warn the party and the church, try to raise some sort of secret resistance to fight off the attack and possibly die in the fighting.  Seeing as how option number one would make for a really unfun session Trith decided to go with door number 2 and ran off to find his friends so they could prepare something.\n\nAfter warning the church, who said it was far too late to cancel the festival, and trying to get in touch with the city guard, whose stronger members were currently guarding the governor at his summer home, the party turned to one last possible source of help: the Church of Kord.\n\nSee, Trith was a paladin of Kord, and in this world Kordlings or whatever worshiped one of two aspects:  Some worshiped Kord as the Thunder God, who brought the rains that made the crops grow, while others worshiped Kord as the God of Battle, with whose blessing one can land a right good one on the face of his foe.  Trith happened to worship the second aspect and was in touch with the local chapter of the church in the city, who were glad to help protect the innocent (and punch evil right in the face).  Trith was also surprised to find that there were two other congregations of this aspect in the city, although these men and women were more of a fight club, less of a monastic order.  Still, beggars can't be choosers and seeing as how Trith himself had been a beggar for large parts of his life he wouldn't start choosing now!  \n\nTrith came before the three congregations and gave an impassioned speech about how there was a risk to the innocent in the city, how evil planned to harm those who had done no more wrong than be poor, yada yada yada and managed to recruit himself about a dozen volunteers to help.  Sadly, because Trith had such a low perception check he likely couldn't find the broad side of a barn if said broad side was the only actual part of the barn still standing Trith did not notice that one of the mercenaries was in the first congregation, allowing the man to go off and warn his side that there would be a lot more resistance then previously expected, making most of the work that Trith had done be moot.\n\nSo it was the night before the festival and through some nice sneakery that was honestly several levels of competency above where the group usually operated, the rogue had managed to find the hideout of the mercenaries who were to pull off the attack.  The group and the Kordlings burst through the doors and started fighting their way through the slightly surprised sellswords, while Trith ran off into the upper levels of the building to confront the leader of the mercs, as Trith was now properly armed and armored and thought himself more than a match for the man.  They met on the roof of the building, the leader planning on leaping off to escape but caught by Trith, who prepared to finish off the man and end the diabolical scheme.  It was at this point that the trap door that Trith had come through was latched and sealed shut, and the other merc from before stoop up that Trith realized that, once again, it was two against one and things didn't look good for him.\n\nAfter being treated like a ping-pong ball for a while, being smacked back and forth between the two burly men Trith decided to gamble it all on one last maneuver and try to bullrush the leader off the top of the building along with Trith, with the reasoning being that if Trith landed on top of the man, Trith would be beat and hurt, but the leader would be a pancake.  Sadly, Trith missed and plunged off into the night alone, where he quickly landed and began bleeding out.\n\nWhile all this was happening, the rest of the party and the Kordlings had managed to clear the building of the other conspirators.  The rogue, wondering where the big dumb (arguably) loveable paladin had gone investigated upstairs and heard the kurfluffle on the roof that was Trith's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Night and managed to slip out a window and up onto the roof just in time to miss Trith hurling himself out into the void, but was still able to catch the two men he was \"fighting\" before fleeing.  The two men, seeing as how they were tired from trying to beat Trith to death, decided to jump off the roof themselves.  Now, these two men had advantages Trith did not.\n\n1. They were much more graceful and dexterous than Trith, and thus could fall with something approaching grace.\n\nB: They were not wearing big heavy armor, and were choosing when/where to jump instead of flinging themselves off, so they could land much more softly.\n\nAnd &amp;#8710;: There was already a nice soft Paladin to land on, to cushion thier falls.  So as Trith lay there, wondering where he had gone wrong in his life, two large angry men fell form the sky and landed directly on his wounded Everything, further causing pain and unhappyness.  And just when things could not get any worse, next round a half-elf landed on him and gave chase after the other two.  Trith was not a happy man.\n\nTrith's contribution to the night ended here. The parties rogue chased after the two mercs but with no proof that they were up to any wrong doing they managed to reach the relative safety of the city watch, and the rogue was forced to give them up.  The rest of the party managed to eventually find Trith laying in the mud, mostly dead and hating his very existence, and bring him back into the land of the positive HP.  Trith never forgot or forgave those two but hey, at least he stopped the massacre, right? \n\nTune in next time for the time that Trith gets punched in the face by a pirate, buys then loses a horse, deep throats a giant scorpion stinger, while said stinger was still attached to the scorpion, and then almost drowns!\n",

        "text": "I have been defacto ~~cat herder~~ gm for my gaming group for over 20 years.\n\nIn between epic quests, legendary adventures, galaxy spanning multi-year campaigns and other assorted tales of wild daring, I thought it might be fun to run a low key fantasy tale. \n\nThis was set in a homebrew low-fantasy world - if you imagine a very loose approximation of the Warhammer world with less religion and divine influence and a much more subdued, rarer, ritualistic/occult style of magic then you will have the general theme I was going for. A kind of pseudo-historical, mildly-mythical land. With orks.\n\nBefore our tale begins...\n\nNormally when gaming I will give the players total free reign with character choice (sometimes we go partially or even totally random, sometimes they just have total choice - all the best character creation happens as the game unfolds anyway), but for this particular game I asked the players to come up with some normal people, reasonably young, suited to life in a quiet rural community. I emphasised that this was going to be a short campaign about normal people - not powerful heroes (or psycho murder hobos) - and asked them to think of appropriate characters they would like to play.\n\nThis is what they (independently) came up with.\n\n\nThe characters:\n\nJethro Rambola.\n\n18 years old. The orphaned son of the Rambola family. Father Rambola had been a hard working farmer and Mother Rambola had been a mean cook. They had died last winter and left Jethro their dilapidated and barely functional farm. But Jethro was not content with the farmers lot. Jethro, since his early childhood, had his heart set on being a lumberjack. He planned to fix up the farm, sell it and move to the woods to begin his own logging camp and lumbermill. Jethro had a solid woodsmans axe and a strong moral compass. He was compassionate for his fellow man but since coming of age had developed a fond liking for drinking and wenching.\n\n\n\nSilky.\n\n15 years old. AKA Ratboy. (He had a pet rat which he kept in a box. He had trained it to do tricks. Apart from Jethro, who's good nature and kind heart forced him to take the abandoned Silky under his wing, the rat was Silky's only friend). Silky was the outcast bastard of the old town whore. His mother was once a harlot, now long past her prime. She had a few offspring. Raised each of them with her own trademarked blend of apathy and cursing. Silky was the latest in her long line of unloved progeny. She sometimes forgot his name. At other times she would forget he existed at all. \n\n\n\nSome other guy. (Jethro's Little Friend)\n\n17 year old chap. I can't remember his name. A combination of this game happening years ago and the fact that throughout the entire game he was constantly referred to by all the players (including himself) and pretty much all npcs as \"Jethro's little friend\".  Eg... \"here Jethro, where's your little friend?\"\n\nJLF was an orphaned child of Mr and Mrs parents (damn this village had a lot of orphans... last winter must have been a harsh and unforgiving ordeal). I think his father had been a hunter who had been recruited by the kings army as a scout/tracker for the war a few years back. \nJLF's father marched off to war and never returned. He was presumed dead. Maybe he had just found a more pleasant home elsewhere \nJLF's mother (obviously) died last winter, heartbroken, penniless and alone, cursing the king for taking away her husband. \n\n\n\nSo there we had it. Three characters made and barely one single mother between them. And she was a disinterested wench who saw her child as an unfortunate hazard of her job.\n\n\n\nSo... the game then.\n\nSession 1.\n\nWe introduce the characters and determime that they have all been friends for some years. JR and JLF, being of similar ages, had grown up together and as Silky grew older and spent more time away from home - roaming the countryside and generally causing trouble - he came to the attention of Jethro. Jethro, being kind-hearted and feeling an intrinsic desire to better the lot of his fellow man (particularly the downtrodden) had shown Silky some kindness and general compassion. Ever since then Silky had just generally hung around, and slowly had become friends of sorts with them both. Or at least, they were the only two people in town who vaguely tolerated his weirdness (more on that later) and so he naturally gravitated towards their company.\n\n\nSilky, Jethro and his little friend were all young men in the town of Oakridge.\nOakridge was a sleepy township nestled on the edge of a large woodland - comprised very heavily of Oak trees (hence the name).\n\nThere was a fairly sizeable river than ran past the town and it often carried barges from the mining camps up in the mountains - past the sleepy little town of Oakridge and on to the bigger, more active and prosperous towns further down river.\n\nOakridge was quiet. Perhaps 30-40 families spread over a few square miles of rural pastures. It was comprised of a central 'town' (a few houses, a church, a tavern, a general store and couple of other commercial ventures, a couriers, a scribe and a very small bank/lending house and some other stores) and a few outlying farms. A sedentary way of life was had by all. The biggest thing that had happened in recent years was the war the ruling kingdom was involved in several years ago and the resulting recruitment drive which had taken all the able bodied men. \n\nOnly a few of the men had returned and those that did were ruined by the horrors they had witnessed in the course of that particularly bloody conflict.\n\n\nOh that, and last winter, which, if character back stories are anything to go on, appears to have killed half the child-rearing inhabitants of Oakridge.\n\n\nSo...(finally)\nThe tale begins. They spend the\nfirst session generally getting to know the people in Oakridge. The owner of the town pub pretty much becomes their surrogate mother and generally looks after them all. The three of them help the citizens with small tasks... amongst other things they helped a farmer chase off some wolves (Jethro was bitten but thankfully his heavy boots took most of the damage and Silky narrowly avoided having his throat torn out after slipping and falling over right in front of the pack alpha), they helped tidy and fix up an old barn for another guy (mostly to make amends for Silky's rude comments/vague threats) and they ejected a couple of rowdy patrons from the pub (again I think Silky had some responsibility as he had quietly goaded the drunkards)... getting an on off arrangement of cheap beer for Jethro and His Little Friend as long as they look after the place when they are around and always eject anyone unruly. No cheap beer for Silky though. And we will soon get to why that was.\n\nA stranger comes to town. Is pretty much ignored by everyone. It seems they are mistrusting of strangers in the little town of Oakridge. The stranger gets drunk and sits on his own in the pub - Jethro and his little friend take this as their cue to eject him from the pub because apparently  stranger = rowdy. After some drunken scuffling the stranger leaves, swearing never to return to this sleepy little shithole. (The gm waves goodbye to that questline - players remain blissfully ignorant of the rumours down south about goblin raiding parties crossing the border and the stranger hopes one day those green skinned bastards finally make it this far north and murder all these anti-social bastard country-bumpkins in their straw filled beds).\n\n\nThe days pass by and Jethro gets involved when some local tax collectors come to town and start tithing the populace. Many of the townsfolk have fallen on hard times, last seasons crops were pitiful and few of them have the money or resources spare for the tithe. Jethro makes enemies of the tax men fairly quickly by speaking out for everyone and protesting the injustice of it all - gathering a small mob to his side in the process. Once they find out who he is they tell him that as the master of the Rambola Farm, he now owes a years tithe. Jethro realises he has no money to speak of and tells the tax men to fuck off. They don't, so he offers to beat them with a stick until they change their mind. (He was backed up by a few of his farm-boy friends - one of whom had a scythe - I think another had a rake. The two tax men had leather jerkins and stout clubs, but that scythe looked pretty mean). \n\nPeople who had made friends with Jethro intervened - hoping to avoid a massacre in the town square - and explained to the tax men that Jethro is just a lad, struggling with the death of his parents and doing his best to raise these other two (pretty much) orphans. (Jethro had established himself as the father figure for the group through his desire to lead and nurturing habits). The tax men give zero fucks about poor Jethro and his plight, but do enjoy having teeth so they ~~flee~~ depart from the town but tell everyone they will be back in one month once they have returned to the king and gathered reinforcements. They will return with the King's Knights and when they return everyone must pay their due. Anyone who leaves town to avoid payment will forfeit their property to the crown and anyone who remains but still refuses to pay will not only forfeit their property but also be treated to an all inclusive stay at the King's Dungeon. \n\nEnd of session 1.\n\nExcept not quite.\nAll of this was the normal stuff that was going on.\n\nDuring all of this, Silky (Ratboy) was doing all he could to win the apparently coveted 'creepiest motherfucker in town' award.\n\nHe followed people - brazenly. He 'cased' their homes - quite obviously and without any apparent concern for stealth - such as, crossing a farmers field and stopping at the window to his house, cupping his hands to the glass and staring at the farmers wife whilst his breath mists up the glass. When noticed by the farmers son or some witness or other he would (as described by the player), \"look guilty and awkward and quickly shuffle away\". \nHe spoke inappropriately and/or aggressively to everyone. Even people who tried being nice to him. He threatened people much stronger than himself  (little scrawny 15 year old that he was) and fairly regularly Jethro had to step in and either calm things down or break some noses until everyone agreed that nobody had been offended and Silky probably hadn't meant all those insults he shouted.\n\nOh, and through all of this, he carried around his rat. In a little wooden box.\n\nWhich was totally fine. I like rats. Except it didn't stop there.\n\nHe found a dead bird one day. \nHe got a new wooden box and put the dead bird in it. \n\nHe found a piece of ribbon in a hedge one day, clearly snagged off of some ladies dress or hair. \nIn the box it went.\n\nJLF lost a little finger through some ill concieved drunken shenanigans with Jethro's wood cutting axe.\nIn the box it went.\n\nSome teeth were knocked from a drunks head by Jethro as he ejected the drunkard from the pub.\nIn the box they went.\n\nA sheep skull found in a farmers field. \nIn the box you go.\n\nA dead mouse.\nGet in the box. \n\nBones stolen from a local graveyard... well no. But he was toying with the idea and kept visiting the place to 'scope it out'. Frequently being politely invited to leave by the priest.\n\nSilky was a kleptomaniac with a penchant for dead things and body parts.\n\nOh... and he spent a lot if time alone at home, talking to his rat. Not generally engaging with the party or really doing anything except 'be creepy'.\n\n\nIt seems that when I asked for normal people suited to life in a rural community, this was somehow misunderstood to mean, 'can you recreate the childhood of a murderous psychopath please?'\n\nI should have known... I had gm'd for this fairly dedicated murder hobo for a number of years. This was going to be interesting.  Little did I know what delights we had to come. \n\nEnd of Session 1.",

Gimme a minute, I need to handle this.\n\nthis is all happening the moment we step in sight.\n\n&gt; DM: what are you guys doing.\n\n&gt; Aitry: **REWBY, WATTERYE DEWING!** \n\n&gt;Brokkr: BAD DRAGON, NO SNACKS FOR YUUH. \n\nAnd I say: Brokkr stacks up behind Aitry (who is hiding behind his shield) as we carefully approach the dragon.\n\nSo as we creep over, the Cleric and Sorcerer are also walking towards the commotion, and do nothing.\n\nAs we come near Morgan asks us if we can help restrain the dragon.\n\n&gt; A: if I'm volunteering, its my dragon.\n\n&gt; CGM: I'll give you guys a cask of ale.\n\n&gt; B: Both a cask of ale. Alright, lets go.\n\n&gt; A: No, Ruby, this isn't how we do things here! NO. Don't you breath fire at us!\n\n&gt; B: Ruby! I need you to calm down!\n\nNow, Imagine 3 toddlers wrestling a angry swan. With a tail. That can breath fire. That's about how well this went\nOne went for the head, and 2 went for the wings, trying to inhibit its mobility.\n\n&gt; E: KILL THE DRAGON.\n\n&gt; A: NO, Ruby is a part of the family, and Family will work things out. And now that she's calm (he means restraint), everything will be fine!\n\nAnd thats the anticlimactic end of this part.\n\nNext time we are gonna go to a kobold invested mine, where we are are gonna have issues with the management.\n\n\n",

        "text": "This is from the same campaign as [Field Surgery](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/62qimp/field_surgery/) and [Doc's Misadventures](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6anhqp/the_misadventures_of_doc_the_cyborg_surgeon/)- to recap, it's an Alternity campaign set in a homebrew setting where the 'alien' races are actually just from alternate Earths, and the world in embroiled in more or less constant conflict. The party works as a scout squad in the army of the well-rounded and not terribly interesting faction, but our capital city is currently a warzone being fought over by 4-5 other forces.\n\nPost-Field Surgery, we're creeping though the recently shot up and bombed out wreck of downtown after slogging through sewers, fighting off the flesh-eating bioweapon and are just trying to get back to base. As we sneak through a bombed out storefront, the GM describes the location with a few quick strokes.\n\nGM: \"It's a bakery - the front windows have bullet holes in them, and cash register is upended and emptied. The store is largely barren and full of debris and concrete dust, but nestled in the corner of a display case are a couple of eclairs.\"\n\nDonut, our resident gun nut perks up. \"Eclairs? I draw my gun.\"\n\nThe GM kind of stalls out. \"Okay....?\"\n\n\"Well are they doing anything? The eclairs?\" Donut is deadly serious.\n\nThe GM doesn't believe that this is happening.  Nope, just continue as normal. \"No. They're sitting in the corner of the display case.\"\n\n\"They're not moving or anything?\"\n\n\"They're *eclairs*, Donut.\"\n\n\"I fire a round at one.\"\n\nA player at his table can't actually doing this. They just can't. Is Donut really pulling a gazebo? The GM gives Donut an incredulous look that the player immediately misinterprets. \"NO! Wait. That might bring attention to us,\" he backpedals.\n\nThe GM looks halfway between annoyed and relieved and starts to open his mouth to resolve this with a more general description when Donut interrupts him. \"I walk up and bayonet one.\" \n\nDice clatter, and Donut's player declares a Good success, and that the eclair on the right will take 4 wounds.\n\nThe GM facepalms with both hands, and gives up. \"You've irritated the eclairs. They lash out at you with their enormous fangs.\" The GM reaches for dice and rolls the first handful there - 3d6. \"Take 9 wounds.\"\n\n\"Oh damn!\" Donut looks aghast, but starts rolling armor. The rest of us can't hold back any longer and just start cracking up.\n\nWe all have a giggle about it and then explain that an eclair is just a pastry. Donut, not having that particular piece of vocabulary, had assumed that our GM wouldn't describe something that wasn't important, and figured it had to be a danger of some sort. Given that it was in the display case, he thought it was some kind of snake huddled there for warmth. An image which was only reinforced when the GM described it attacking him with fangs.\n\nAt the next session we bought an eclair for him, and put it on his seat before he arrived.",

        "text": "Last Sunday morning our dm woke us all with a text: \"I feel like dungeoning\" \n\nI, not one to let an opportunity slip, ask:\n\n\"what time?\" not really carring for his sudden urges, but more focused on setting it in stone before the moment passes.\n\nLong back and forth conversation between all the players; warlock cant come, so we can't continue with the Friday night campaign. \n\nDm: \"we can play a flashback session for the druid\" \n\nthe druid comes from a different world , his homebrew world, that has just had a terrible war between his old character and his evil brother and is now rebuilding. The druid's home world had no dragon's, until they destroyed his home, that's all he remembers. So we are all like, \"FUCK YES! \"\n\nQueue the start of the session where we all make level 1 characters, the Friday night rogue brings his brother and so we are short 1 character sheet. I can already hear you say: \"just print another.\" but you would be underestimating my laziness. \n\nThe solution, my twin brother and I do something original and new, we play twins! (so we can both use the same sheet, come on, keep up)\n\nMe: \"I don't care what class, but we are going to be dwarfs named Aitry and Brokkr.\"\nBro: \"barbarians then?\"\nMe: \"sure and we are volunteer town guards and builders\" \n\nWhile we are doing this the dm is frantically trying to get a session together and is laying down dungeons and sorting his mini's.\n\nSo our greatest creation is born (I'm still laughing as I type this) \n\nThe party = \n\n+ 1 pre ptsd halfling druid, Finnen \n+ 1 half elf storm sorcerer who is constantly trying to light trees on fire with his lighting lure (not really, but you know that thing normal people do when you hand them a machete? They start hacking at everything.) this is a first time player and Lil brother to the Friday rogue) \n+ His cousin, a wood elf cleric ( Friday night rogue) \n+ 1 wood elf ranger and bounty hunter from fearun, who is making the best he can because he cant get back to fearun. (Friday night paladin) \n+ And 2 dwarf barbarians standing guard at the gates of town. Played by my brother and me, I play Aitry (A for the eldest brother) he plays Brokkr (the dm has a preconceived notion that we are power players, dont know if that matters)\n\nThis is where we start, the set up is done\n\n___\n\nWe start at the outskirts of town, 2 dwarfs are standing guard, bored out of there minds\n\n&gt;B: \"so, who aver throows the farthest wins, lusers has to get the axes\" (he says, wielding hand axes)\n\n&gt;A: \"but yar's is wey smoller, mine is narly's big 's me\" \n\n(we did the Highland accent all session long, we did it poorly, but we commited, I'm not gonna keep typing it like that) \n\n&gt;B: \"just throw, you pansy\"\n\n**I physically get up from the table, take a few steps back and act out a overhead throw** \n\nWe both roll, I win\n\n&gt;B: \"what did you take a running start for? We never do that\" \n\nI lose it at this point \n\nSo in-between laughs I say that I get the axes.\n\nQueue the ranger (E), a haughty, dainty wood elf: \n&gt;E: \"good day, I'm looking for a Bugbear\" \n\n&gt;A: \"what kind of people do you think live in this town?\"\n\n&gt;E: \"I don't care much about who lives here, but I've got a contract and I'm here to interrogate a prisoner of your's\" \n\n&gt;B: \"we don't keep any prisoners personally, but you can try the stockade\"\n\n&gt;A: \" just follow the road, straight through town\" (wrong direction) \n\n*The focus stays with the ranger as he goes to a tavern to ask for better directions, it happens to be the inn from the parents of Finnen and he's outside feeding the chickens and asking them about there day. He overhears the ranger and decides that the chickens have been feed, so his job is done and that leaves time to follow the ranger!*\n\nthe dm is scrambling to come up with npc's, he's got the combat ready but forgot to flesh out some of the npc's\n\nBack to the dwarfs\n\n&gt;A: \"where's Dave? Isn't he supposed to be here by now?\n\n&gt;B: \"I think so\"\n\n&gt;A: \"so you haven't seen Dave?\"\n\n&gt;B: \" I've been with you for the last 6 hours! When did Dave come by?! Fuck Dave!\"\n\n&gt;A: \"how about you go look?\" \n\n&gt;B: \"why do I have to go?\"\n\n&gt;A: \"fine, I'll go\"\n\n&gt;B: \"let's throw for it\"\n\n&gt;A: \"ok, but I want 1 of your little axes\"\n\nWe roll, I lose\n\nB: \"you go check out where Dave is\"\n\n*I go to the barracks, looking for Dave.*\n\nThe dm is relieved that he only has to act, for he only just found out that Dave was infact a townguard\n\n*I see a fellow guard and I ask if he'd seen Dave.*\n\n&gt;guard: \"not sure, but I saw him walking away with 1 of the cobbler's daughter's\" \n\n&gt;A: \"the cobbler has daughter and wasn't he seeing that goat herder's daughter?\" \n\n&gt;guard: \"I wouldn't let my dog get on her either, but you know Dave and the Sally hasn't been in town for a ten-day\" \n\n&gt;A: \"Did Dave upset her? Fucking Dave, where did he go?\"\n\n&gt;guard: \"stabbles and before you ask, Steve is drunk on a bunk\"\n\n*to the stables!*\n\n&gt;A: \"Dave, let's go, my shift is done and stop messing with the heads of all the sweet girls in town\" \n\n*We get Steve, drunk off his socks. O well, not like you have to be sober to stand at a gate anyway.*\n\nEnd of part one, not sure how funny it is for you guys, but this was my first time really getting into the roleplaying and collaborative storytelling, not to toet my own horn, but I came up with halve the npc's in town and had a blast.\n\nIf you guys want I can make another post about the dragon that's lockef up at the stockade, but that depends on the demand, this took quite some time on a phone. And I'm not sure how it's going to look.",
