        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI spend a lot of time on reddit, and I consider it to be the best social aggregation site on the web. However, it feels like as reddit grows, its voting mechanism becomes less effective in showing me the content that I'm actually interested in. The majority opinion tends to drown out the rest (aka the hivemind effect), and unpopular subjects get drowned out.\n\nI think the solution to these problems is personalization: Showing each user a feed that matches their interests.\n\nSo, I decided to take matters into my own hands, and I created [Filterbot.news](https://filterbot.news)\n\nIt works by figuring out the topics for every article you vote on, and adding them as weights to your interest-profile (positive weights for upvote, negative for downvotes). The algorithm then applies that profile to every submission, assigns each one of them a score, and finally compiles a feed that is uniquely suited for each user. There are also other cute features, like backlinks into discussions at reddit and hackernews.\n\nIt's still at an early stage, but it's ready for real use, and I'm proud to show it to you. I will be adding a lot of features in the coming weeks, and I hope to get some input from this excellent community.\n\nI would really appreciate any insight, feedback or whatever I can get :)\n\nThanks,\nErez\n\n*P.S. sorry for the shameless plug, I hope you'll forgive me, after all it's for a good purpose*",
