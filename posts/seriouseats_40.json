        "text": "Has anyone tried saving their pasta water for future cooking? Kenji talks a lot about using as little water as possible to increase the concentration of starch, and how professional restaurants use the same water the whole night (making the sauces at the end of the night better than when they first open).\n\nWould it be possible to reserve your pasta water after cooking and reuse it to mimick that effect? Obviously the main concern is food safety, but if you're boiling it every time you use it I imagine you'd get a decent shelf life in the fridge before it spoils?",

        "text": "I did a traditional roast dinner for 13 friends and family. I didn't get any photos as I was so busy in the kitchen, and then just making sure everyone was served promptly. And then very busy eating, of course! In addition to what's listed here, I served some simply roasted broccoli and cauliflower, some vichy glazed carrots, an herbed bone marrow butter, some basic homemade dinner rolls (in case I messed up the Yorkshire puddings), and creamed spinach. Below are the Serious Eats recipes that really highlighted the meal.\n\n--------------\n\n[Prime Rib w/ Red Wine Jus](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/12/perfect-prime-rib-with-red-wine-jus-recipe.html): I splurged on a 15lb bone-in, prime rib roast, USDA Prime Grade, dry aged. I used Kenji's method for reverse sear and the red wine jus. I have to say while the jus was incredible, the meat came out so perfectly I didn't even think to use it until near the end of the meal. Truly consistent med-rare edge-to-edge. I salted it, and let it stand in the fridge, air-drying and dry-brining for 4 nights, and it really did help to season it well pretty much all the way through. I was really impressed by how deeply and consistently seasoned it was. And everyone else seemed to be impressed triply with all of it, with a couple people saying it was the best beef they could recall having. A lot of that had to do with the seriously excellent quality of the meat to start with, but Kenji is owed thanks for helping me not fucking it up, and really hitting the sweet-spot with it. \n\n[The Best Roast Potatoes Ever](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe.html): And they really were. It probably didn't hurt that I used duck fat for these. One note: I either didn't keep enough of my potato chunks large enough, and/or boiled them a little too long, because the breakdown from the alkaline water caused me to lose about a 3rd of my potatoes. Some of them just turned into straight-up mash right away when tossing with the infused fat, presumably, the smaller chunks. So do not take lightly the instructions to keep the chunks large! The surviving 2 thirds that remained still came out great and really amazed my diners. This is my go-to method for roast potatoes from now on for sure. Though I'll likely just be using olive oil on most nights instead of the duck fat!\n\n[The Best Yorkshire Puddings](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/12/the-best-yorkshire-pudding-popover-recipe.html): Yummy! I haven't had these in years and had never attempted them myself. I did 2 nights in the fridge to better develop flavor. I used muffin tins. I doubled the recipe given the number of guests and eye-balled the amount of pork lard I was putting in each one for my fat. This might have been a mistake. Some of them had enough fat that it floated on top of the batter after adding it, and then they rose fast enough to push the hot fat out and over the edge and onto the bottom of my very hot oven producing a ton of smoke as I was trying to finish up dinner. Measure precisely, or err on the side of caution. The puddings themselves still came out wonderfully. Golden brown, fluffy, eggy, \n\n[Double-Chocolate Cream Pie](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/11/chocolate-cream-pie-meringue-recipe.html): It's not just that I'm not much of a baker or pastry guy, I'm not even much of dessert or sweet eater in general. On rare occasion I like a little bit of really good ice cream, some dark chocolate mousse with an espresso on the side, or maybe a really good blueberry pie. I just don't eat dessert often and when I do I want it small and bit less sweet than what most people go for. So this was for everyone BUT myself, though the very dark, rich chocolate filling appealed. I'm good with making my own pie crusts, but everything else in this recipe was new to me. Stella's recipes give me confidence though. I made it to the letter, with the vanilla meringue on top too, and it came out beautifully, if still a bit sweet for my personal tastes. However! I had doubled a couple of these recipes due to the number of guests including this one, and for the second chocolate pie I topped it with this [thick raspberry whipped cream](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/08/super-thick-fruity-whipped-cream-recipe.html), which while very rich was far less sweet than the elegant meringue, and with some tartness from the berries it was the perfect pie for a dark chocolate-loving, less-sweet inclined guy like myself. A+! Thank you Stella. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nPutting together a celebratory family-style meal like this, with so much time and money invested, could have been very daunting, but these recipes made so much of it so much easier. Kenji, Dan, Stella, and the whole team continue to have my confidence in their testing, methods, and recipe writing skills. Thank you all and Happy Holidays!\n\n",

I followed the recipe exactly; butter was at the right temperature, eggs were fresh, I used freshly squeezed lemon juice, etc.. I tried twice and both times the sauce didn't emulsify enough and the sauce was runny, more akin to slightly thick melted butter than a real sauce. \n\nI then had a thought. Watching the video Kenji put up, his immersion blender has very little clearance. In comparison, my [Cuisinart blender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARQVM5O/) has a pretty significant space between the blade and the bottom of the rim. As I was slowly drizzling the butter in, I think a quarter of the butter was in the cup before any real blending happened. I don't even think the blender could reach the egg yolk until around then. \n\nThankfully I was able to make the hollandaise the old fashioned way, three sticks of butter later.\n\nCould this be the source of the problem some people have with the foolproof hollandaise?",

I salt 3 days or so prior to roasting. \n\nDo you use convection or regular heat? Part of me thinks regular heat so it doesn’t dry out as much.\n\nSecondly, I like to apply some fresh/herbs to my rib roast to add additional flavors. I can’t remember when I added them. I fear if I add them at heat blast step the flavor will be null, and doing it too early could burn them. I plan to add rosemary, thyme, parsley, garlic, and fresh ground pepper. When would you suggest adding these in the cook?\n\nI couldn't find detail of this in the posted recipes/instructions. Thanks for your time. \n\nedit: It's interesting when you read multiple recipes from SE there are slight variations. In one Kenji mentions he likes to heavily salt his meat at least 4 days before roasting while in another one he states salt at least the day before, and up to four days ahead of roasting. \n",

I understand with books this large, that there will be mistakes that get past the authors/editors, just I'd like to see them corrected when possible. I made the baked mac and cheese the other day, and while it was delicious (how can you go wrong with 2 pounds of cheese), it turned out a little more souffle like than I expected, or honestly would have liked, and I had trouble melting all the cheese in the roux. Seeing this issue being brought up a year+ ago with no effort at correcting it, is slightly disappointing, kind of like when you open a fun sized package of starburst and get 2 banana ones.",

I have a few questions regarding the process and burgers in general. \n\nWhat is the reason for using no oil? Does it ever stick or does the higher fat content (assuming its 80/20) of the patty prevent this? \n\nIf I grind my own mix should the brisket portion be from trimmed or untrimmed cuts?\n\nAfter the flip I know it says to let patty and the pan \"kiss\" but is this long enough to develop a crust on the second side?\n\nAnd silly question but is there anyway to add a smoky/wood flavor without using liquid smoke? I prefer the smash style but I miss that added smoky flavor.\n\nAlso I'd appreciate any personal tips/recommendations on burgers. They have always been my weakest \"staple\"  and I'm trying to step it up. I'm trying to bake my own buns next.",

Once the water is cooked and the rice is hot I'll crack my eggs and add the soy sauce etc. It never seems to whip properly though, and I always end up with rice with whipped eggs but a little puddle of liquid at the bottom. At first I thought this was soy sauce that didn't get bonded, but now I'm not sure.\n\nAny ideas?",

        "text": "Usually, I'm pretty good in the kitchen. I don't screw things up in stupid and easily avoidable ways. I don't make obvious mistakes, and I stick to timings pretty well.\n\nYesterday this was not the case.\n\nAt nearly every step of the way I did something stupid.\n\nLet's take the fat, for example. I collect fat from roasts and store them in the fridge and freezer until I use them or my wife questions why I'm storing so much animal fat. I had a couple of tablespoons of duck fat in a small jar in the fridge, and I had some beef fat in the freezer somewhere . I couldn't find the beef fat, but I did find ... more duck fat. I set the fat jars by the vent on the range to let the pre-heated oven melt the fat to measure it out. The potatoes were threatening to be ready before the fat had melted so I cleaned the jars and dipped them in the potato water. One of the jars broke in a neat circle around the bottom, dumping all of the still-cold duck fat into the potato water. I scooped that out and into the small pan with the herbs and garlic, set that doing its thing while i fished out the clear transparent possibly sharp thing from the clear, transparent and bubbling stuff. During this time the potatoes were boiled for far too long. On straining them a large proportion turned straight to mush - probably 80% of them. I proceeded anyway, reasoning that at worst, I'll have some tasty potato patties. I shaped mush into flattened-sided balls as best I could, and the few potatoes that held some shape were left to their own devices.\n\nThe initial browning wasn't as good as I hoped. The second 20 minutes did nearly nothing. Then around 15 minutes later I had the best roast potatoes I've ever had - dark brown and crispy on the oustide with garlic and rosemary flavour, and the creamiest softest inside I've ever had.\n\nSee how I spell \"flavour\". With a u. I'm British. I've had a lot of roast potatoes in my life. I can only imagine that if I don't screw it up at every step of the way then they'll be even better.",

The anchovies really add a lot of depth to the flavor and I don't recommend leaving them out.  Not sure if my soup was any different in color than Kenji's but mine came out a somewhat radioactive green...this may have been a combo of using slightly more broccoli than was in the recipe and also cooking it about 30 min rather than 20.\n\nIf you need a nice warm soup to make this winter, hop on this one!",
