I imagine that would have been an easier fight than the USSR.\n\nPerhaps they were hyperfocused on the USSR due to ideological genocidal rage? Or because the supply lines going from Germany to Russia are more tenable than those going from Germany to Iran?\n\nThanks in advance for any insight on this question.",

        "text": "Afghanistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia. The country is very mountainous which is a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it means it protects the country from foreign invaders. A curse because it isolates Afghanistan. It is a country that is slightly bigger than France, yet its history has been tarnished by more recent events like the rise of the Taliban. The new constitution in 2004 established a presidential system. The future looked bright and Afghanistan could have headed toward democracy. Sadly, however, the Taliban rose again and it now rules Afghanistan. For 2 millennia the lands around the mountain range of the Hindu Kush were part of different empires until the modern period of history. It has been at the crossroads of four distinct cultures, Southwestern Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia.\n\nThe knowledge of early human settlement and civilization in Afghanistan relies on archaeology. Not much is known about early Afghanistan. However, what we do know is that archaeology has suggested that humans have inhabited the modern lands now known as Afghanistan since the neolithic era. There is even evidence to suggest that the people of Afghanistan have been practising agriculture for 10,000 years. There is early evidence to suggest that the early people in Afghanistan might have had a belief in the afterlife. Archaeological finds prove that the early civilizations in Afghanistan had lapis lazuli a precious material and, in the sixth millennium BC there were exports of lapis lazuli to the Indus valley civilization from tribes and early civilizations in Afghanistan. The tribes of Afghanistan even exported their lapis lazuli all the way to the lands now known as Greece in the area of the Aegean Sea by the second millennium BC. Even in the early days, the lands of Afghanistan had commercial links to the known world from India in the east all the way to Greece in the west. Afghanistan in the early ages of humanity had close trade connections with its neighbours. Because of its unique position between modern-day India, the Middle East, and Central Asia, it has been described as a “highway of conquest” because of the many empires that have conquered the land over the years. Even though today many calls it the “graveyard of empires'' because of the failed attempts at the Soviet and British invasion of the land. Cyrus the Great conquered Iran, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia, and soon, in the sixth-century bc Cyrus the Great leading the Achaemenid Empire conquered Afghanistan. Darius the successor to Cyrus the Great created many provinces in modern-day Afghanistan. The conquerors of Afghanistan, the Achaemenid Empire even adopted the religion of Afghanistan, Zoroastrianism. The Achameds created many satraps(provinces) in Afghanistan, the most important being Bactria. The reason Bactria was important was because of the lapis lazuli, agricultural lands, and gold in the satrap(province). Cyrus was killed in 530 BC. A few years later with the backing of Bactria and Archosia Darius the 1st came onto the throne. He started his reign by putting down many rebellions in his vast land. Soon a new person in history came who you might have heard of named Alexander the Great. Alexander was born in 356 BC while his father king Phillip was at war. He had received 3 important messages on that day, one about a horse race, one about a general winning a battle, and the other about Alexander's birth. Some say he was descended from the gods as a shrine of Artemis was burned the same day he was born, which some say means that Artemis stayed with Alexander instead of protecting the shrine. Alexander entered school at age 7 and quickly understood and mastered the art of warfare. In 334 BC Alexander had an army of 45,000 with him. He also brought scholars and doctors with him and his ship landed in Phrygia. Alexander wanted revenge for the burning of Athens in 480 BC and promised to liberate the many Greeks who had settled in the area. In the same year, he arrived at the river Granicus (in modern-day Turkey). The Achamed’s had gotten 25,000 troops from the local satrap (province). Since Alexander stood out from other soldiers because of the white plumes on Alexander's helmet two Persians tried to kill the king of Macedonia and split his helmet open, but one Greek soldier saved him by stabbing the Persians with a spear. He soon won the battle. He had controlled all of Anatolia by 333 BC. In January 332 BC Alexander reached Tyre. He wanted to take the city as it belonged to the Phonecians who supplied the great army of the Achameds. The Cypriots who had rebelled against the Persians had joined Alexander. After seven months he defeated the people of Tyre and conquered some parts of the levant. He then marched toward Egypt. Egyptians welcomed Alexander as the Egyptians had been heavily taxed by the Persians. He was then offered the title of Egyptian pharaoh Which he accepted. In Egypt, he also founded Alexandria. Darius had heard of Alexander conquering Egypt, so he went to Bactria to get troops as the Bactrian troops were good. Soon 100,000 Persian soldiers gathered in Babylon. In October 331 BC the battle had begun. At first, the Persians had encircled the Greeks, but Alexander took advantage of a gap in the lines and defeated the Persians. Alexander soon conquered much of the Achaemenid and by 330 BC the Achaemenid disappeared from history books. The Greek Macedonians In the same year in 330 BC the Greek Alexander the Great entered Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he wasted no time to name several cities after himself like Alexander Adriana and Alexander-Ad-Caucasum. When Alexander died his great empire was split up between several generals. The successor of Alexander in Afghanistan was defeated by Chandragupta and forced to give up a lot of lands in modern-day Afghanistan. This was the Mauryan empire one of the first empires in India. Buddhism became the religion of both modern-day India and Afghanistan under king Asoka of the Mauryan empire. The Mauryan Empire started to decline after the passing of king Asoka. Many Greek colonists moved to Bactria and in the middle of the 3rd century bc a Greco-Bactrian kingdom gained independence. In 184 BC they took over regions of Afghanistan like Aria and Arachosia and got as far as the Mauryan capital. Under the reign of Menender they stationed their capital at modern-day Sialkot In Pakistan. These Greco-Bactrians would soon be outshone by a new empire when there was a great migration of Central Asian people which was perhaps caused by a change in climate that dried up the region. One of these groups known as the Yueh Chin in 130 BC conquered Bactria, a region of modern-day Afghanistan. A few of them attacked the Scythians. Over a few years the Yueh Chin who later became known as the Kushans, conquered much of the Indian subcontinent including modern-day Afghanistan, Punjab, Sakastan, and Aria. Their empire went all the way from the Caspian Sea to the Aral Sea in the second century. The Kushans traded with both the Romans and the Han. The Silk Road was revived. Trade with the Middle East was also revived. Greek culture remained in the region from the times of the Macedonian Empire and so did Buddhism which traveled through Central Asia and all the way to China. This combination of Greek and Buddhist cultures created a unique new architectural style of building called Gandharan. The Kushans remained for many years and in the third century AD they gave up some of their territories to the Persian Sassanid dynasty which had succeeded the Parthians.\n\nThe defeat of the Sassanids by the Muslim Arabs in 637 and 642 was caused by internal dissension and a few years later in 650 AD they occupied the regions of Herat and Balkh. In the early eighth century AD the Arabs conquered the region of Sind which is where modern-day Karachi is located. In the ninth century AD, the religion of Islam reached Kabul and Ghanzi. Muhmud then ruled and kicked out the Hindus of the area and conquered lands as far as the great Caspian Sea all the way to Varanasi in modern-day India. He encouraged his people to convert to Islam. After Muhmuds death the power of his empire was weakened by a Seljuk invasion. Then the Mongol invasions happened. The Mongol invasions left ruins of villages wherever they went which can still be seen today. Even today parts of Iran which were once cultural centres during the Islamic golden age were now progressed back in culture and science and were behind Europe. It is the same with Afghanistan. Some historians say that the force that the Mongols invaded Afghanistan with was the “atom bomb of its day”(Tanner 81). However, unlike Hiroshima or Nagasaki which were mostly able to rebuild their cities Afghanistan was never able to rebuild itself and its cities to their former glory. The only place that rebuilt itself was Herat. The Mongols conquered Balkh and Massacred its population and razed the city. At first Herat in Afghanistan was spared due to them surrendering to the Mongol horde but when there was a rebellion and all of its citizens were executed. When the Mongols reached the city of Bamian they also razed the city and killed much of its population leaving behind nothing but hilltop ruins. Genghis Khan could have kept conquering past Punjab but did not want to as he was worried about the effect the heat of that region would have on his army. When A Moroccan traveller visited modern-day Afghanistan he found Kabul was just a small village and that Ghanzi was devastated and also found that Balkh was in ruins. After Genghis Khan's death his grandsons would rule for a bit but from 1364 onward Tamerlane ruled Afghanistan. In 1370 Tamerlane claimed that he was emperor of Balkh. His extensive empire would go on to include northern India and Afghanistan. When he conquered Delhi in 1398 he killed much of its population. He destroyed irrigation systems in Sistan which caused a region which once had rich soil to slowly turn into a desert. Although barbaric, Tamerlane was a man of culture and helped to build colleges and mosques, under his reign there were advancements in culture, music, calligraphy, architecture and literary advancements. These advancements were part of a greater Timurid renaissance that lasted a century. Husain-i-Baiqara gave Afghanistan 40 years of peace. At the turn of the sixteenth century Babur, a descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan got in power in Kabul and Ghanzi.\n\nIn 1497 Babur conquered Samarkand, but his supporters abandoned him, after his supporters abandoned him he would also conquer Ferghana in modern-day Uzbekistan. However, He was forced to leave Samarkand. He took Samarkand but again was forced to leave. In 1504 Babur would become master of Kabul. In 1511 Babur would try to retake Samarkand but was again forced to leave so after this he abandoned his desire to conquer the area, instead moving his focus to India. In 1525, he defeated the lodi kings, an Afghan dynasty. In 1527 He founded the great Moguls which would last two centuries. He would go on to live until 1530 when he died, and was buried in Kabul. The long rule of many empires over Afghanistan did not disappear until the eighteenth century. One of the tribes of Afghanistan in 1709 named the Ghilzai tribe under their leader Mir Wais Hotaki, revolted against the rule of the Safavids. The tribe conquered Kandahar. However, in 1715 the leader of the tribe Mir Wais Hotaki, died which means that the succession of Mir Wais was contested. In 1722 Mir Mahmud went on a campaign and made it as far as the Persian capital. He massacred the city which ensured that it would never recover. Mir Mahmud took the throne of the Safavids. In 1725, he died and was replaced by his cousin Ashraf. The Ghilzai drove the Persians back to Herat which would later be captured in 1732. He took the Persian throne and later in 1738 would go on to take Kabul and Kandahar. He then marched to India and took Delhi. In 1747 the Durrani Empire was founded by Ahmad Durrani. Most nationalists in Afghanistan consider him their founding father like people in the USA would consider George Washington to be their founding father. From 1747 onward Afghanistan for one of the first times was its own country. Ahmad started off his reign by attacking Ghanzi and Kabul and then took Peshawar. He met a Mogul army at Sirhind. He was overcoming the other army, but then a train exploded which killed hundreds of his own men, but he managed to retreat. Then Ahmed made a peace deal with the Mogul emperor ceding the province of Sind as well as some other parts of Afghanistan. Ahmed marched on Herat in 1750 and proceeded to surrender. He went to Meshed and Nishapur who both surrendered the following year. Ahmed moved his focus back to India in the winter of 1751 capturing Lahore. He took over the region of Kashmir in the same year. The tribesmen enjoyed the riches and fruits of their many outings to far-out lands in the old world along with Ahmed who also enjoyed the same riches as the tribesmen. He returned to India in 1756 in winter and went to Delhi to sack the city. Chinese expansion from the late 1750s into Central Asia was a threat to the Muslims who lived there. Some of the people of Central Asia even asked for Ahmad's protection from the Chinese. He also asked the merchants of the area to stop trading with the Chinese. In 1761 Maratha armies met at Panipat. The battle that ensued was massive as there were 80,000 soldiers on each side. The Marathan armies were initially winning, but Ahmed led a counterattack that collapsed the Maratha army. This battle is one of the most significant in Afghan history as if the other side had won, the emergence of the power of the Sikhs would have been prevented. Ahmad left for the hills which left a power vacuum that would soon be filled by the Sikhs. Some Indian historians say that this battle lessened the effectiveness that Indians could resist the British. Ahmad returned to India and defeated the Sikhs, in the process wrecking their holy sight but each time he attacked the Sikhs, they recovered. In 1772 Ahmad died at the age of 50. The reason Ahmad could so easily conquer his neighbours is that virtually no one stood in his way. The second son of Ahmad was to succeed him, Timur Shah. Timur Shah was the person who moved the capital to Kabul in 1775. However, Kabul was just the summer capital, but Peshawar was the winter capital. Timur had 12,000 bodyguards. Timur compared to many rulers of Afghanistan had a reign of peace and tolerance. There were a lot of revolts he had to deal with in his vast realm. Luckily he had his 12,000 bodyguards to deal with the rebels. The revolts got so bad that two regions became independent, Sind and Amu Darya. Even by 1793 most of the land conquered by Ahmad was still part of the realm of Timur. However, in the same year, 1793 Timur died. Since Timur had 20 sons, and he did not nominate any of his sons as the next leader, this was a succession disaster. Luckily Zaman Mirza was in the capital and took the throne and got the support of an important Durranni official. Zaman Mirza had an unexceptional military skill. In 1797 after many attacks against the Sikhs, he for a brief period of time took the city of Lahore. However, he was forced to leave and, he left the Sikhs to have the lands to the east of the Indus River. The British feared the Durranis as they thought that they would cause a revolt in their Indian colony to occur. The Silk Road had been replaced by maritime trade in India at this time. Firearms had also gone worldwide through trade as at this time the world was more connected through trade than it had ever been before. The use of firearms also stopped the age of nomads like the Mongols from conquering far-off lands.\n\nIn 1800 Zaman was exiled. However, Zamans successors did not succeed in fixing the internal rebellions of the land. In 1809 the Durrani Empire allied with the British in case of a Franco-Persian invasion of the Durrani empire. The Islamic golden age was now over because the Europeans had all the riches of the new world while the Islamic powers were stuck with the riches of the old world. Over the years the Islamic powers had gone down in the global rankings of great powers. This caused the once prosperous Islamic powers in the days of the Islamic golden age, to almost in a way progress back. Take as an example the Ottomans who once ruled parts of Africa to Asia and even some places in Europe and threatened the Austrians at one point. By the 19th century, they were but a dying man, the sick man of Europe who in a hundred short years would collapse and their Middle Eastern lands would be colonized by European powers. By 1818 Britain had extended its reach to parts of India in the hopes of growing opium to sell to the Chinese. As the East Asian opium market had begun in 1773. By the same year in 1818 Britain had got control over western India. Since Britain, Russia, and Afghanistan all had ambitions over this area it was only a matter of time, before the 3 would go to war. In the book Invisible History: Afghanistan's Untold Story, it describes the throne at Kabul as ¨a see-saw battle between family members”. This description helps to describe the political climate at the time. It helps give us a lens into what it was like to live at that time in Afghanistan. This ¨see-saw¨ battle between the families would last for most of a century. Russian and British entry into the region complicated the competition for Afghanistan. This would last until the end of the 20th century. Dost Mohammad in 1818 marched from Kashmir and took Ghanzi. By 1826 he took Kabul. In 1835, he sent a letter to the Russian tsar in an attempt to establish friendly relations with Russia. In 1836 in an attempt to take a city from the Sikhs, he tried to take Peshawar. However since he did not have much support he failed. When Dost Mohammad was in Kandahar he stopped to make a diplomatic agreement with the Persians to form an alliance against the Sadozi dynasty. The British sent an officer Alexander Burnes to recruit Dost Mohammad. In October 1838 Britain with 12,000 Indian and British troops invaded Afghanistan. The British wanted to remove Dost Mohammad and place Shoja on the throne. However, there was other reason the British invaded them for imperial reasons like controlling the north-west frontier to secure the British possessions in India. Kandahar was guarded by 12,559 calvaries. The British also wanted to establish a buffer state. The British wanted Shah Shoja to give them a modern equivalent of 20,000 pounds annually to give up all claims in Peshawar which was a payment that was used to maintain the 5,000 British troops in Peshawar. The British had evolved its reason for the war to gain more influence in Afghanistan. There was no national Afghan army at the time instead the emir got tribal armies all across the land. This war was one of the first times when a European power trained a Afghan force. The British army entered Afghanistan in 1839. Kabul was taken by the army of the Indus in April 1839 and their plan was to eventually take over Kabul. Ghanzi fell to British too. On May 3rd Shah Shoja was restored to the throne as a puppet of the British. Some of the Indian troops in the British Afghan force returned to their home in India as there was a short time of peace. They then built a barrack south of Kabul. A barrack is just a building usually meant to store military personnel. However, the supplies for the army were not in the same location as the army which made it not a defensible position. Shah Shoja was merely a figurehead of Afghanistan and did not have much power. After Dost Mohammad escaped prison he went to Parwan with an army in November 1840 and almost defeated the British who at the time were considered one of the most professional and well-trained armies of the world. He however would soon surrender. In January 1841 a rebellion was put down in Afghanistan. In November a riot led to the murder of Alexander Burnes. Continued attacks had reduced British morale. By 1842 the British were forced to leave Afghanistan. In 1863 Dost Mohammad died. In 1865 Tashkent was annexed. Samarkand was also annexed a short three years later. The succession was disputed, but Afzal’s son helped him to raise an army, and he was placed on the throne in 1866 and died in 1867. After, Azam, Afzal’s brother was placed on the throne. In January 1869 Sher Ali retook Kabul and Kandahar. Sher Ali’s ten years of rule would be very impactful to Afghanistan’s future. The Afghans were caught between two major powers Britain and Russia. In 1874 the British government tried to implement a new policy on Afghanistan a “forward policy”. The leader of Afghanistan did not want a British mission saying the Russians might also demand a mission in Afghanistan. After nearly 40 years after the disastrous campaign in Afghanistan, the British would try again. After 2 years of warfare, the British won, and the Afghans were forced to give up lands to British India. The treaty that was signed said that the Afghans would accept a British mission. Abdur Rahman the new leader of Afghanistan would go on to appoint people into his government not based on skill or talent but based on how loyal the politicians of Afghanistan were loyal to him. Afghanistan at this time had also developed into a modern nation-state. A nation-state is where a group of people have their country, where a state and a nation are one and the same. After Abdur, Habibullah began to rule Afghanistan in 1901. Habibullah did not really help that much to modernize Afghanistan to the technological or cultural advancements of the Americas or Europe. He had four wives and 50 children. His father had tried to introduce with some limit technology of the west like hydroelectric. He had an interest in modern western technologies and tried to build a hydroelectric plant in Kabul. He also had an interest in cars. He accepted the fact of the treaty of the second Anglo-Afghan war that said that Afghanistan would let Britain control their foreign relations. The treaty made Afghanistan a protectorate of the British which means the Afghans were under protection by the British. He did not know whether to participate in the great war(ww1) or not. In 1919 in February Habibullah was assassinated. His successor Amanullah would rule for the next few years. He wanted his father to side with the Germans during ww1. Amanullah would try to modernize Afghanistan during his reign. He would also try to reform the country. In 1919 the third Anglo-Afghan war was declared by Amanullah. After a few months of warfare, the British would recognize Afghanistan as independent and would allow Afghanistan to handle its own foreign relations. During the great depression, Nadir Shah ruled. His first act as king was to handle the rebellious Tajiks. In his territory In 1931, he made a constitution that had some human rights to satisfy the liberal and pro-democratic factions in Afghanistan. In 1933, he was assassinated by a student at a high school. He was then replaced by Zahir Shah. Under his reign, he sold weapons to Germany for 27 million DM in 1936. Afghanistan proclaimed neutrality during ww2. Afghanistan joined the League of Nations in 1934 a predecessor to the UN. Over the years of Afghanistan, it went under several monarchs, but then there was a democratic experiment. In 1964 a new constitution was adopted that was made by seven experts in politics. After 1965 the country began to decline mainly, because of the unemployment rate among young people like high school and university students. Powerful clan leaders in Afghanistan would begin to take power in democratic elections by using money to gain power. In 1979 the Soviet Union would invade Afghanistan and 80,000 Soviet troops and 1800 tanks invaded. There were many military advisors for the Soviets and the number went from 700 in the middle of the year to 2000 near the end of the year. Karmal was placed as president of the communist party of Afghanistan. However, the Soviets began to realize that Karmal was unpopular and unreliable, so they tried to indoctrinate children and teach them a biased view of history. Many students were forced to learn the politics of Marxist-Leninism. Many Afghan students were sent to the Soviet Union to study so much so that 4000 students a year were coming to the Soviet Union a year. The UN (United Nations) did not like the Soviet Union's invasion and condemned the Soviet invasion. Within the first year of the Soviet invasion the forces had gone down to 30,000. Soviet officials supported the invasion of Afghanistan at the end of the year in 1979. There were many improvements such as 34 new mosques being built in Kabul. The education system was changed to include courses in Russian language and political science courses. It was impossible in the time of the invasion, to avoid the sovietization of Afghanistan as now students were forced to learn Russian language courses and learn about communism. The press and media were all state owned instead of privately owned, so the youth were indoctrinated with the theories of communism and the theories of Marx. Different provinces in Afghanistan had the local languages spoken in school in the provinces for the first time. The Soviets tried to take advantage of the resources in the north of Afghanistan mainly, deposits of gas. The US would help to supply the opposing side to the Soviets. After years of war the Soviets lost. The peace treaty between them which were signed at the UN's headquarters. In 1994 an extremist group known as the Taliban was founded and after years of civil war the Taliban ruled 75% of the country from the years 1996-2001. The name Taliban roughly translates to students. The leader of the Taliban declared himself emir of Afghanistan which had not been held since Dost Mohammed in 1834. In 2001 the USA invaded Afghanistan and the Taliban almost went away, but then it rose again and in 2021 the American forces left Afghanistan. Today many afghan women do not have access to education because of the laws that the Taliban put in place. Although Afghanistan has had a turbulent history, in the years of the Democratic elections in Afghanistan the future looked hopeful but sadly many things have ruined the chance of democracy. The soviets invaded and after Afghanistan devolved into civil war and the Taliban rose and the US's attempts to stop the Taliban were futile, so now millions of Afghans live in a society that is not completely free.",

        "text": "I was recently reading a book about the late Roman Empire and I was struck by how polarizing this issue was to early Christians. The Bible says that Jesus was both the divine son of God as well as a man. Now this seems a little odd and certainly raises questions I suppose but, to me at least, not much more so than many other issues raised by the (often conflicting) descriptions of the nature of divinity in the Bible. However, it appears that the issue of defining the exact admixture of divinity and mortality in Jesus drove early Christians absolutely off the wall. \n\nThere were a bewildering array of differing schools of thought (Nestorianism, Arianism, monophysites, Chalcedonian, etc.), and what appear to a modern reader to be very minute differences such as whether Jesus the Son was the same in essence (homoousios) as God the father or merely very similar (homoiousios), were apparently serious enough to early Christians to result in sustained attempts at suppression and even violent persecution. Why was it that out of all the potential points of conflict this one seems to have particularly seized the imagination (and intolerance) of Christians of the late antiquity?",

One friend believes it would take him many years, as he would be horrified by the prospect of modern technology, try to burn it all and escape. Others have said that it would only take him a few months - he was a military genius, after all.\n\nSo my overarching question is - how long would it take for somebody of his calibre to adapt to the new technology, and complete a very difficult videogame? Would it really be that difficult for somebody from another time period? \n\nThanks for any responses ahead of time!",

Was there any realistic prospect of such a peace etc happening or was it simply pie in the sky thinking?",

It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents, or chance outcomes, that are there in addition.\n\nTo what extent would the discussion on \"general laws\" of historical development (formation of states, for instance) correspond to this outlook. While I'm not into dialectical materialism, I certainly don't subscribe to the \"big man\" perspective on history either. I found the quote quite poignant, and if you apply it to some random historical events, it becomes illuminating. \n\nOne example (stolen from *The Rest Is History* podcast) is WW1, which was probably always going to happen (fundamental laws), but specifically started because a certain individual got lucky and managed to kill the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire. \n\nHow is this issue framed when historians discuss the course of history these days?",

They noted that this has been a requirement for any jurisdiction. Can anyone provide more insight and documented history on this? I'd like to understand when stormwater runoff reduction requirements first appeared and if there were any federal regulations that guided this. It looks like the rational method was first documented in 1851 and the SCS was published in 1954… were we doing anything like that before? And when did it become a requirement that you needed to detain it. \n\nToday, stormwater quantity requirements have been included in the same permits that require water quality, but it sounds like before that existed, there was still a requirement. Who enforced it if so? I can find a lot of info online about water quality and the Clean Water Act, but have come up short on finding out more about the water quantity. Thanks in advance!\n\nOriginally posted to r/civilengineering",
