        "text": "\"Sure,\" I said.\n\nMy friend pulled out a deck of cards, shuffled it thoroughly, then gave it to me.\n\n\"Pick a card, any card. Look at it, then put it back,\" he said.\n\nI was suspicious, so I asked him if I could shuffle the deck, too. He agreed, so I shuffled it five times, cut the deck, then shuffled it again.\n\n\"Satisfied? Now, like I said, pick a card, then put it back.\"\n\nI wear glasses, and I wasn't about to let him see the reflection of the card. I asked him to turn around, and he begrudgingly agreed.\n\nI quickly looked at a random card from the middle, the five of diamonds. I put it back, and before he could turn around, shuffled the deck again.\n\nAfter he turned back around, I returned the deck to him. \"What's so funny?\" he asked. I must have had a smirk on my face, but said, \"Nothing. Please, continue.\"\n\nHe shuffled the deck again, then asked me to cut the deck. I did so, and he split the deck into thirteen piles of four cards each, rearranging the piles in what seemed to be a random order, then stacked them back up. He shuffled the deck again.\n\nHe looked at me, and said, \"Do you remember your card?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Did you want me to tell you what it is?\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary, just keep it in mind. Now, I will perform two tricks at the same time. First, I will bring your card to the top of the deck.\"\n\nHe put the deck on the table, face down, and grasping the sides of the deck, he pulled his hand up, as if picking up my card and bringing it to the top.\n\n\"And...\"\n\nHe flipped the top card over. The Jack of Spades.\n\n\".... and transform it into the Jack of Spades!\"",
