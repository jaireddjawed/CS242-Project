So, which book of his lies most unjustly in the shadow of his magnum opus? I have personally read Gatsby, This Side of Paradise, and part of Tender Is the Night (cannot give it an assessment). \n\nThis Side of Paradise certainly has good parts, such as the humor of the characters of Princeton (the discussion of the ghost is hilarious), and how personal it is (Fitzgerald writing of what Amory read), but it has its hollowness. Amory's development is underwhelming. The poetry is trudge-worthy at times The ending with his conversation with the industrialist seems so artificial, and his views toward capitalism are childish in it. Perhaps I don't understand it well.\n\nHere's how I would tentatively rank his novels, based on what little I have heard and the little that I've read:\n\n1. The Great Gatsby\n2. Tender Is the Night\n3. This Side of Paradise\n4. The Beautiful and Damned\n5. The Last Tycoon\n",

        "author": "WhenIntegralsAttack",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/7vheeu/discussion_of_ts_elliots_the_wasteland/",
        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI just finished reading T.S. Elliot's *The Wasteland*, and I wanted to start a discussion. \n\nMy own thoughts are that this poem is largely an apocalyptic tale of Western Civilization. In a certain sense, we have run our course. We have said all that we need to say, and now we are fragmented and disparate. The lack of any one narrator in the poem is emblematic of the lack of cohesive identity/ideology in Western thought. It is difficult to see the ferocious fighting between different cultural and political sides in the West and not agree on some level with this. \n\nA big portion of this poem evokes the passing of time and the rise and fall of past great civilizations (Falling towers/ Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London 374-376). All of these cities are former Great Cities emblematic of their cultures with the exception of London, which is a current Great City. However, this list forces us to realize the London is merely next on the list of cities to diminish in glory. Thus, all of the events of the poem take place against the backdrop of this apocalyptic setting. Elliot repeatedly references the \"violet hour\", which can be taken to mean twilight- the end of day for Western Culture. \n\nThe last two parts- IV. Death By Water and V. What the Thunder Said- are interesting to me, because they overlook the ruin of our decaying culture and then look beyond it.\n\nIn Death by Water, we have the image of a drowned Phoenician sailor Phlebas. He set out into the sea only to be drowned. The metaphorical resonance should be clear, he left his home- the ideas and culture he inherited from his ancestors- to search for truth on his own in the great void of the unknown (here, the sea). Of course, the void swallows him up and drowns him. Recall in part I. the clairvoyant Madame Sosostris- who presents the card of the drowned sailor with pearls over his eyes. She is described as \"the wisest woman in Europe.\" The reason, I believe, is that she understands that the search for Truth inevitably ends in our demise, and that all cultures which rise on the prominence of some insight or way of thinking will eventually decline as well. \nGoing back to book IV., Elliot writes \"O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, / Consider Phlebas, who once handsome and / tall as you.\" (320-322) This is a warning to never think that somehow we're the ones who have found Truth, or that we're the ones who have everything figured out. Phlebas was just as tall and handsome as we are. \n\nI read part V. as the aftermath of Western Civilization's decline. There is a lack of water (meaning, the source of life or a lack of what gives life purpose). There are hellish red sweaty faces. No place or time is specified, meaning that this could be anywhere in the world and at any time after the present. Then, rain comes out of the sky saving humanity. Somewhere, and at some time, humanity gets some new inspiration, allowing them to rise and dictate the thinking for a time. \n\nAfter all of this, the opening line makes more sense\n\"April is the cruelest month, breeding / \nlilacs out of the dead land, mixing /\nMemory and desire, stirring / \nDull roots with spring rain...\"\n\nApril is cruel, in that the new inspiration will eventually fade. We are born into the world only to die. Any new civilization will go out to sea and eventually drown like Phlebas. The arrival at Truth seems to ever elude us. \n\nWhat do you think of the poem? Do you read it like I do?",

Forgiveness and The Marrow Thieves sound really dark and intriguing too. Precious Cargo is probably going to be the underdog as it's more of a feel good novel, due to the description, but it could have something more to it since I haven't read it yet.
