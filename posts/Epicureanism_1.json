If one should rule one should not become a Tyrant as this would create unwanted anxieties and thus upset their tranquility. There are no laws sins except to not harm and be harmed in an agreed upon social compact by that particular society. Seek pleasures with prudence weighing in on the pros and cons of a pleasure and a pain which to pursue and what to avoid. As not all pleasures should be pursued and not all pains avoided when a greater pleasure can be obtained later and vice versa.  \nOne should also pursue with prudence the obtainment of Aponia.   \n\n\nStudy nature, philosophy and the mind to get rid of fears and anxieties so one can reach Ataraxia.  \nSex is okay if it brings one pleasure and should be pursued but if it brings more pain than pleasure one should avoid it.  \nOne can be celibate if they choose so to be such as I believe Epicurus was from what we know of him. But that doesn't mean he didn't do sexual acts they knew wouldn't cause a baby to be born. Because we know he had no children himself at least nothing was recovered to indicate such.  \n\n\nHow am I coming along in my understanding of Epicureanism?

        "text": "Lately I've been ruminating on the idea of having low standards, a quality typically looked down upon in the West.\n\nTo be simple in the past was seen as a good thing, and \"sophistication\" was not a desirable trait (I read about this in a rhetorical context though ie Sophistry as a means of deception. It may have applied to how they lived as well, not sure).\n\nNowadays it would seem one has a happiness advantage by desiring foods that are easy to make, cheap to buy. And this falls in line with the Epicurean idea of not pursuing luxuries when easy pleasures do just as well.\n\nOne place where low standards may hurt is mate selection. There I see the problem being that a sufficiently low standard allows a partner to be net harmful over the long term.\n\nBut the dividing line may be in the length of timeframe. One would be foolish to select a mate who actively tore down his self esteem. That's a low standard on a critical dimension for achieving happiness. But looks? There I'm not as sure. If one can still enjoy sex with her, then a low standard may help. Contending with less competition over the long term would be a nice bonus.\n\nSimilarly, foods are short term consumables when measured on taste, long term consequences measured on nutrition.\n\nIn my family, I have low standards in my career choice. My cousin is a doctor, I'm a web developer. If we measure on joy during work hours, I think I actually actually achieved a higher standard (not by conscious decision though).\n\nSo my working theory is that low standards are great for qualities that impact the short term. Over the long term, one should have high standards. Would appreciate any counterpoints or counterexamples anyone has to offer!",

I suppose another argument he could say based on the quote from principle doctrines that all pleasures are good but some pleasures entail annoyances many times greater than the pleasures themselves. Like for example the pain of a break up between a lover or the lost of one jealousy...etc.\n\nDid any epicureans have a say on how great the pleasure of love between romantic relationships was compared to the other pleasures? Like did they believe it lasted longer than bodily pleasures? I mean when one is in love with another person. The feeling you get from Oxycontin and I think also cocaine.

        "text": "As a 32 year old, I still have no commitment on the topic of settling and raising a family vs singlehood. But I lean towards the single life. Some of my reasons \\(I think\\) will broadly apply to others, others are personal to myself and my individual nature. In the interest of discussion I'd like to share them with you to see where others stand, especially in the Epicurean context:\n\n* Social / Family: Very important for all people and family life is at the core of this. There are downsides to the nuclear arrangement though, namely lock\\-in, and less ability to be with others \\(a common complaint I hear\\). Although of course the family unit does have greater social opportunities with other units and family oriented events. But on balance I think staying single allows greater flexibility overall.\n\n* Flexibility for other pursuits as well. I notice I don't have issues exercising, riding my bike, etc nearly as much as my married friends do. The positive social enforcements of a family are also constraints. Family constrains one's time, his most valuable resource. Family may also constrain financial resources and one's ability to engage in meaningful, enjoyable hobbies. A person in a family has less capacity to customize his life to his personal desires. Of course the trade is the much tighter family bond that is quite powerful and possibly moreso than other pursuits \\(obviously unnatural ones and maybe even some well reasoned ones too\\). \n\n* Risks. If married, you have a big risk of divorce. Everyone thinks this risk applies to others, but divorce statistics suggest the risk is present for near everyone. On the other hand, singletons who are strong introverts like myself risk isolation if they don't expend more time consciously reaching out.\n\n* Pleasure. Is it easier or harder to maintain ataraxia from child rearing? My gut says harder. But after they leave the nest then you have a major socio\\-familial achievement that is likely to benefit you in old age. As an aside, I realize this sounds bluntly narcissistic, as these points often due under the lens of focused consideration.\n\nThose are my thoughts. How do you guys feel about the issue of having a family vs staying single?",

If so, how do you ensure you're not excessively diluting your present pleasure?\n\nI personally accept a physical discomfort only when using mental visualization / mindfulness is not an option. For example, I'll do a run or workout to benefit my future self, same with studying something difficult to benefit my career skills.\n\nBut I don't sleep on the floor or practice poverty; a Sunday journal is sufficient and maybe 70&amp;#37; as instructive as a whole night on the tile, which may affect my physical ability into the next day.\n\nCurious if anyone takes a different approach \\(stricter or even more easy going\\) and if so, what your thought process is.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Epicureanism/comments/8houuu/contentment_as_the_modern_usage_of_epicurean/",
        "text": "Over time pleasure has evolved as a word and now is generally understood to be focused on physical, sensory enjoyment (before one clarifies a broader meaning). In thinking about what Epicurus really means when he speaks about the pursuit of pleasure, I find this to be well suited:\n\n&gt;Contentment\n\n&gt;A state of happiness and satisfaction.\n\"he found contentment in living a simple life in the country\"\nsynonyms:\tcontentedness, content, satisfaction, gratification, fulfillment, happiness, pleasure, cheerfulness\n\nDefinition taken from Google.\n\nTo me, a sense of contentment means a person is more generally satisfied with life. It has a deeper, longer term connotion. At some level this implies that one's days are also going well to be able to build up to such general sense of life satisfaction.\n\nWhen I think of a generically content person, I assume he has good friends and a stable profession that he at least somewhat enjoys. I assume family life is going well, if he has a family. If a content person has troubles, they are either small or his personality is very good at minimizing them. He is content after all. I believe this captures the essence of Epicurean ideals very well.\n\nWhere the idea of contentment may fall short is in the domain of small, daily activities. Contentment to me implies that the person is passively satisfied. The lack of pursuit does fit with Epicurean ideals, but the lack of implication of action may not. As a counterpoint to this potential drawback, one word can only be expected to do so much. This is even more true under the unguided course of evolution that words and language in general takes. I feel contentment has come out of the cauldron in a good, clear state for us.\n\nFinally, I believe contentment is closer in definition to satisfaction and particularly ataraxia, satisfaction with one's current life state, than pleasure.\n\n\nDo you agree or disagree with me? Did the ancients ever specifically express disagreement of contentment as an ideal? Or if you believe pleasure, as the term is used today, is still the better suited goal, what have I missed?\n\n",

I have a lot of friends but I don't see them regularly outside of my normal life however I have friends at work and at my gym that I see regularly.\n\nI am at this inflection point and I am considering what makes me happy and I'm not sure it is just really the absence of pain. I am wondering if there is more required than just this. I think I have enough friends and social support plus I am close to being financially independent and therefore not a slave. I have a beautiful wife and 3 kids as well so I don't think I'm missing out on any big bricks when it comes to living a good life.\n\nI just wonder how I am going to live my life going forward. So the absence of pain is critically important but do I need more goals or things to do to give my life more meaning or excitement. What are your thoughts ?",

        "text": "I identify as an Epicurean, I note that the question of if an Epicurean should avoid politics is controversial and unresolved.\n\nI have yet to resolve the conflict in my mind of if I should pull away from politics.  I have compromised in that I will refuse to vote in the elections in UK in May 2018.  I however still deliver election leaflets for some candidates as part of my business.\n\nIt is a correct observation that the ruler is corrupt and the ruled are ignorant.  The idealistic are destroyed, and the corrupt prosper in politics in a dog eat dog reality.  The Trump election (USA) and the Brexit referendum (UK) were settled by clever manipulation of voters using personal information, artificial intelligence and foreign interventions in domestic election processes.  The notions that the ruler is corrupt and the ruled ignorant is true today as it was two thousand years ago.\n\nPolitics is tribal, it sets neighbours and brothers against each other.  Politics brings to mind agitiation, conflict, anger, anxiety and discomfort, it is a subject considered best avoided at the dinner table.\n\nThe individual makes no significant difference in the world, their vote is meaningless.  The vocal protester are persecuted, avoided or killed.  Politics brings trouble to the table.\n\nIf the goal of the Epicurean is ataraxia, a calm and contented mind, then I argue politics is to be avoided.  Regardless of how corrupt or bad a political system is, the Epicurean who does not threaten the system, but blends in, will continue to enjoy ataraxia; but those that oppose and become involved in politics encounter pain and suffering for their troubles.  \n\nI argue that all things find their natural level.  What is bad vanishes, and what is good prevails, without intervention, for this is the way of things.  \n\nI also observe that what is agitated creates ripples of agitation around them, and what is calm begets calm.  I note situations where if I am calm or angry amongst cats or dogs, I create a similar impact in those animals.  \n\nEven though the many of this world cry out to us to join their crusades, it is better in my opinion to ignore them all, and find ataraxia in our own gardens and friendships divorced from the pain and suffering others brought upon their own heads because of their non-Epicurean deeds and choices.

The other factor of how much they help you should not be taken into consideration because that defers from person to person.Isn't that why Epicurus said friendship is important, because when we talk with friends or share experiences it bring us great joy.\n\nSo to bring it all together, should I only include people who I can share anything on my mind with and not be judged as friends or people who I know that will be there for me in troubled times as friends. I know friends can do both those things but I have personally found that rare and saw that most of the times only one of these two factors are present.\n\nI would also like to know how you guys define your friendship?\n",

Live simply, don't worry about death, avoid pain, desire causes unhappiness.  Chill with friends.  Don't chase gold, fame, status etc....  Very simple, very useful.  However, his is a philosophy of the civilized man, whose physical well being is ensured by the standing army of the kingdom in which he lived.  His rejection of war and of the violence inherent in the human soul is disingenuous.  That is why his followers were destroyed by the more warlike Christians and Stoics.  He has been accused of weakening the moral and militant fiber of the Romans, and I suspect there was some truth to that.  He offers a very easy to follow formula for happiness, but there is so much more to life than happiness.  His is the philosophy of a zoo animal.  The civilized world is a zoo of sorts, it creates a weaker animal.  Epicurus.......shut the fuck up.  He was also so smug about the spiritual world, as if logic alone was all man needed for a full and happy life.  Smug bastard made a god of himself.  He was a dangerous con man.

        "text": "I am no scholar and I have only a slight familiarity with this subject; I'm not really asserting this point, just wondering what you might think of it.\n\nMy understanding of how the term 'hedonism' is used here seems to refer less to an actual embrace of pleasure, than to an embrace of a healthy sort of satisfaction as a measure of the correctness of human choices. Correctness is not measured by pleasing the gods or abandoning all desire or achieving a virtue like excellence; it's measured in terms of our own feelings, and the feelings that best reflect it are satisfaction, contentment, gratitude, and enjoyment of the simple, healthy, day-to-day things.\n\nIn a phrase, it seems a lot like \"man is the measure of all things\", which sounds a lot, to me, like humanism.\n\nThe common confusion of hedonism with bacchanalia has caused no end of grief, and I wonder how much might have been averted if the early translators had made a different decision here. When I substitute humanism for hedonism in my mind as I read on the subject, everything makes more sense to me, and the results become more clear.\n\nTo live correctly, live honestly and fearlessly,  cultivate the simple healthy desires, and enjoy them. If you feel good in your day to day life, you're doing it right. One needn't worry about dying, or the afterlife, or the gods above. Don't get drawn in to conflict or to unnatural desires that defy healthy satisfaction.\n\nIs there anything not humanistic about that? To the extent that they overlap (and I appreciate that this may be a fairly small overlap) do humanism and epicureanism differ significantly from one another?\n\n---\n\nAfter writing all this out, I realize that I might really be asking a different, and much simpler question. Consider these two statements:\n\n* Pleasure is the thing you should seek.\n\n* Pleasure is the only reliable sign that you are seeking the right things in the right way.\n\nFrom one point of view, these two statements are essentially the same, but from another, they are quite different. If you embrace the second view, pleasure is a guide, and not itself the goal. Of course, you always want to be aligned with your guide, so it's very easy to mash these two together.\n\nThe idea of pleasure-as-a-moral-guide seems very humanist to me (and perhaps I misunderstand what humanism is). Pleasure itself as a goal seems, in a subtle but important way, like something else.",
