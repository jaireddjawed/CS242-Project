[In 2022 The Dank Charity Alliance raised **$12,047**](http:\/\/events.stjude.org\/DankCharityAlliance2022) for St. Jude and we\u00a0hope to exceed that number in 2023.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n**Why we are fundraising for St. Jude?**\n\nSt. Jude\u00a0Children's Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer,\u00a0sickle cell disease,\u00a0and other life-threatening\u00a0disorders.\u00a0It is the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments developed at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to 80% since the hospital opened more than 60 years ago. St. Jude freely shares the breakthroughs it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children.\n\n*Join The Dank Charity Alliance*: make a post or a donation for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and together we can help St. Jude change the world.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nIf you feel like helping (No pressure!):  [http:\/\/events.stjude.org\/DankCharityAlliance](http:\/\/events.stjude.org\/DankCharityAlliance)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677070872.0},{"title":"My most recent oil painting for a reddit user, I'm particularly please with this one - I hope you enjoy!","author":"Hara-Kiri","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/hpeqb3m46jna1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678723833.0},{"title":"Her first time hearing this song.
