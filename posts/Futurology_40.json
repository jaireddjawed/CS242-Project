It lives free and happily until one day or it's ambushed and it's done versus being locked in the farm it's entire life.\n\nHowever unlike farming, We couldn't all go hunting animals regularly they're simply isn't enough for the majority of modern populations to go out and hunt.\n\nHowever, I had a random Idea come to my head, breeding and seeding. We artificially assist in animal husbandry for animals that are hunted for food like deer and hog, Then release them into the wild to increase the population to a level where hunting is sustainable.\n\nPeople can still eat meat, if we do it well they'll be a surplus of animals even after everyone hunted, and the meat we eat is much healthier.\nThe skills of animal husbandry would be spent on something that simultaneously more humane to the animal and more in synergy with nature.",

An algorithm could readily accomplish this?\n\nGuess not.\n\nNext I asked for it to tell me the penance if I were to confess adultery, lying, taking the Lord's name in vain.\n\nNope.\n\nSo, I do have feedback here. I think the Catholic church SHOULD look into AI such as ChatGPT to listen and respond to penitents. There are so few priests and they are stretched so thin, I could see a service wherein the penitent came to church, offered their confession and received a penance, and then the priest absolved those penitents as a group.",

We have a robot for that. Faeries? We have waterdroplet holograms for that - just kidding also robots. Dopplegangers? Deepfakes. Magic spells? Well, let GPT-20 talk to you for a couple of minutes and see what it CAN'T convince you to do.  \n\n\nNot only that, but what you're willing to believe is completely intellectually unmanageable, because clearly reality isn't as restrained as you thought.  \n\n\nYeah I know, old news. However!  \n\n\nIf we're to assume that we'll live in a sane world in the future, and that maybe in sheer philosophical terms our sense of our existence is existentially tougher then we believe, what's required?  \n\n\nSome unknown would have to take commonplace robots off the table. That's 50% of the problem right there. The other half is something that puts bounds of some kind on the world. There has to be a reason not to believe in most gods and monsters.  \n\n\nThis is something of a challenge: we've got  \n\n\n* Gene edited humans\n* AI\n* Cybernetically enhanced humans\n* Gene edited animals\n* Digital ghosts\n* [Actual military UFO reports](https://www.christophermellon.net/post/setting-the-record-straight) (Source: former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence in the Clinton administration - 3rd from the top)\n* Technologies which are, technically, nothing spooky, but are fucking magical, like commonplace AR goggles\n* The prospect of fucking brain-chip telepathy and hiveminds all adding up to some sixth sense bullshit.\n* The refinement of the sixth-sense bullshit the brain does have\n\nFight the urge to let your sense of reality slip away. This is clearly a bit much, is my point.  \n\n\nThe problem with this stuff as far as our sense of reality goes, is the lack of definition. If we expect to live in a world that is sane, something has to arise that will impose limits. If it doesn't actually prevent these things, something has to cancel it out.  \n\n\nFor example, it could:  \n\n\n* Eat the gene-modified humans\n* Choke the AI\n* Freeze our technology out of making cybernetically enhanced humans cheap\n* Cull gene edited animals\n* Short-circuit Digital ghosts\n* Fuck knows about UFO's\n* Restrain the proliferation of AR\n* Ban the brain-chip\n* Clarify the 6th sense\n\nSo we're either looking at a lot of convenient coincidences, or some kind of Overpowered dudeling that takes an interest.\n\nSo either our worldview becomes some degree more complicated, or we accept that There Are Forces At Work^(TM).",

Use Neuralink to make a digital clone of a colony builder‚Äôs mind, by uploading a lifetime of data into the cloud and making a digital clone of the person using the latest in deep learning neural network AI. \n2. Put it in the body of a humanoid robot. \n3. Send it with frozen human embryos and seeds on a seedship to an exoplanet hundreds (or thousands) of light years away. \n4. Land on an earth-like exoplanet and build a new civilization with the human minded robot serving as caretaker to get the first round of people born and raised until they can take over. \n\nI found this idea interesting enough to write a sci-fi book about it.  Do you think the concept is possible or would it just be science fiction?",
