        "text": "Been reading here for a few days now. I used to be a CO, working for a private company, for a while and will try to share two or three storys from my time at the job.\n\nSome thread in another subreddit reminded me of this occurance though, so i decided to start with this nice and easy one first :).\n\nI was once driving down a road going through a university campus in [Small Town], Oklahoma, all being a 25 zone, doing my best to obey the speed laws. A cruiser came the opposite way, saw me, lit up, made a u-turn behind me, pulled me over. The whole 9 yards, asking me sternly where i came from, where i'm going, what i did the last hour, what i'm about to do and what not...\n\nWent to his cruiser with my documents, came back after a few minutes, telling me that i was speeding and how he would let me off with a courtesy warning.\n\nThis is the ticket i got: http://blog.michaelkesler.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/speeding.jpg\n\n(I wasn't really mad, more like amused to a level of \"the heck just happened\"? That's why i kept the ticket, because the whole situation kinda amused me. Personally, i think they were looking for a car similar to mine - a green 96 chevy lumina - for some reason, checked on me and then came up with a fake reason for stopping me... But who knows. :) )",

        "text": "I hate driving to work in uniform. I absolutely hate it, despite living some 10 minutes away from work. But there are some days when life gets in the way, and you just don't have time for everything that had to be done before going to work.\n\n\nYesterday was one of those days. I usually change at work, in the locker room, or don the second uniform at home and wear a hoodie over it. But man, it was hot and I just couldn't bear the thought of a hoodie over shirt, undershirt AND stab vest. And I was in a hurry. Because there's nothing worse than waltzing into the staff meeting after the managers are in.\n\n\nOn my way to work there's this intersection where you can only turn left from the left lane, while the right one is straight ahead only. The street merges into a 3-lane large road. I am turning left, the traffic light is red and behind me there's a clunker of a Jeep Cherokee, mid-90s, that keeps inching towards my truck. Impatient driver. Oh well.\n\n\nAs the light goes green, I take off, just to see the Jeep behind me flooring it and jumping in the lane on my right. The driver is an old lady... wait. She's rolling down the window as she catches up with me and pops her head out - she's got this really angry face, and as her windows aligns with mine I hear her going, **\"YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SH-\"** then her eyes bulge, seeing the flash on my shoulder and the vest... (Our uniforms are very similar to other law enforcement in the city. Can't tell the difference unless really close.)\n\n\nI look at her, raising an eyebrow and she abruptly locks her eyes forward through the windshield and drives on, with a blank face. She made a serious effort to drive slower than me for the next 10 kms or so, constantly looking straight ahead and avoiding any eye contact, even when I stopped next to her at the next set of lights. It was almost like I could hear her brain box ticking: \"If I'm ignoring him he's not there. If I'm ignoring him he's not there. If I'm ignoring him he's not there.\" \n\n\nSo yeah. I hate driving to work in uniform. It seems it messes up other people's day.",

        "text": "So as I stated before in my first post in still a week in, by myself at this point with no assistance from my FTO except when I have a question, in which case I'll just call out to the cluster and ask him.\n\nSo mornings are actually quite easy. I come in and get my head count, get my pass on, relieve the other officer, get my morning cleaning supplies out and then head to morning break. At 7:00am I come back into the pod, lights on, get a quick security check in and unlock all doors on one tier. Everybody comes out, cleans their cells and gets ready for inspection, usually takes about 30 mins.\n\nSo I'm doing my morning inspections, no big issues to report, just small stuff. I get to the 3rd to last cell and I see the inmate still wrapped up sleeping in his bunk.\n\nMe - Hey, you doing alright man? \n\nI/M - Man fuck off I don't feel good.\n\nMe - I understand but you still need to be up, dressed and participate in clean up. Do you need a medical request form?\n\nI/M - yeah we do this shit every fucking day, I already know!\n\nMe - Alright, I'll get you one but this is a failed inspection, will be a next shift lockdown starting at 3:30pm (1530) and end at 0600.\n\nI/M - whatever just go away.\n\nSo I just chalk all this up to him not feeling good, I kinda look away from the back talk. I get the approval for the lockdown and while my FTO is in the pod checking on me I walk over and tell him again, \"Hey I/M, it's gonna be next shift starting at 3:30 ending at 0600 alright?\" He responds \"man go away!\"\n\nWhatever, suit yourself. So fast forward to about 1455 or 1500 I see I/M trying to talk to me through his cell door. Kinda confused as to why he didn't just come out and talk I intercom him to come out and talk to me.\n\nI/M - Man when do my lockdown end?\n\nMe - As I told you twice already, it starts at 3:30 and runs through tomorrow morning at 0600.\n\nI/M - Man what the fuck, you said it ended at 3:30! Man! Fuck you! *turns and begins to walk away*\n\nMe - Excuse me? You want to repeat that?\n\nI/M - I said! YOU! ARE! A! DUMB! ASS!\n\nMe - Alright that's fine, go lockdown now.\n\nCalled out to my Cpl and let him know of the situation and he ended up charging I/M an institutional charge for disrespecting staff.\n\nMy first charge! I was in such high spirits the rest of the day. \n\nI've been having so many of my questions answered and I'm getting a lot more confident in my position, your gonna be seeing a lot of me!",

        "text": "So I know this isn’t from a squad car but so far everyone has been pretty open to the stories from correctional officers.\n\n\n“Hey I need someone in here right now.” The radio crackled the tension obvious in his voice. I looked at my coworkers and we took off running to the unit. I arrived the same time as my Lt. to find the entire pod standing, screaming and advancing on the officer’s desk. Six officers and I formed a line in between the 80 or so inmates and the officer calling for assistance. Luckily it hadn’t turned physical yet and we were able to push them back into their bunk areas. Keep in mind this is after midnight and they should be bunked up and settling down. So far it was manageable, most inmates usually back down when more than one officer arrives, but there were several stragglers that wanted to remain defiant. After a few minutes we got the crowd to calm down enough so my Lt. could start talking to the ring leaders and figure out what was going on. It had started with one inmate refusing to clean the floor to the standard and had escalated quickly from there. It is funny how something little can blow up into a full disturbance. As the unit was calming down one inmate decided he wasn’t happy with that and stood up and started screaming at the Lt., threatening to start the mess all over again. Jail is a stressful place and it doesn’t take much to light the match. The Lt. told him several times to sit down and the inmate continued to get more animated and aggressive. Lt. gave the order to escort him from the unit, my partner and I grabbed his arms for an escort and the fight was on. To my partners credit before I even decided how to react he already had the inmate on the floor. I joined the pile and we began to restrain him. That’s when all hell broke loose. The already charged atmosphere exploded and the inmates emptied their bunks and formed a crowd around us. Not going to lie, I was expecting to get stomped while we were restraining the trouble maker. But to my coworkers’ credit they managed to form a circle and held the line long enough to get him restrained. Watching the video later I realized how close it was. The officers behind me were literally shoving people back that were trying to get to me and my partner on the ground. As soon as he was cuffed I dragged him from the unit and threw him in a holding cell. Once he was secure I hauled ass back to the unit and helped settle the pod again. As per usual once the original problem leaves most of the inmates settle down. We regained control of the unit and no one received any serious injuries. It is days like that that reaffirm who has your back. And it was fun.\n",

        "text": "I thought I would post this somewhat funny story since I saw a few suspect posts today. \n\nThis happend a couple years ago on a saturday night. The night before my buddy and I went hard with some friends so we thought we would take it easy.  We ended up drinking a few beers, smoking weed all night, and running some games on Halo Reach. \n\nIt was close to 230-300am, I was feeling pretty crossfaded and tired, so I thought it was about that time I take off and walk home. \n\nMy friend only lives a block away, which is the perfect distance to light up a square and finish as I arrive at my door.  With us living in the suburbs of Chicago at the time, I would never see anyone out this late at night. It was always very quite and peaceful which was perfect for a walk home. \n\nHowever, when I got to the end of his driveway and started turning down the street to head to my place, I saw a cop car turn onto my buddy's street. He was driving very slow, had his spot light shining at all of the houses and yards, and best of all, was heading my way. I quickly lit my cigarette and continued my walk home.  About 20-30 seconds later I could hear his crown vic's v8 idling behind me and I could see those infamous headlights out of the corner of my eye. \n\n\"Oh fuck\" I thought.  I am 19, I have alcohol and weed in my system, weed on me, and a backpack with my laptop, xbox, controller, and a few games in it. I thought \"god damn it, don't tell me there was a robbery in my neighborhood\" because I look like a prime suspect.  It was the summer, so I had my all black white Sox hat on backwards, black jordans, black b ball shorts, Blackhawks t shirt, and my eyes were probably redder than Satan's ass.\n\nFinally, the officer creeps up next to me.  \"Excuse me sir, can I speak with you for a moment?\"  Well, I'm fucked I thought. \"Yes sir, what can I help you with.\"  He stares at me for a quick few seconds and then cracks a small smile as he chuckles to himself. \"You're not going to belive this, but someone called in saying they saw a cougar roaming the neighborhood and I've been sent out to do a quick search.  Have you seen a cougar tonight by any chance?\"  \n\nI let out a quick laugh \"no shit... that is pretty nuts. No, luckily I haven't seen any large cats roaming around.\"\n\nWhile still smiling \"I figure there probably isn't anything, housewife probably saw a dog or something.\" As he let's out another chuckle.  I laugh too as relief continues to overwhelm me. \"Well\" he says \"if you do see anything, you know who to call.\" \"Will do officer, have a good night.\" I say as I start to walk off. \"Thanks. You too\" he chimes back as he continues rolling down the block shining his spot light at yards and houses. \n\nThe next day my buddy's and I had some good laughs over my unusual stop late that night. \n\ntl;dr I was questioned by a cop about a cougar.",

        "text": "Reading [this](http://redd.it/3ec0l5) reminded me of something that happened to me many years ago.  \n\nI was working way on one side of town, a 45-minute bus ride from my apartment. This particular night, I had to go up across town another direction to see a friend of mine, although the reason why is lost to time.  Catching the bus back to my apartment, I saw the bus I needed to catch to see my friend passing by and it would be a half-hour before the next one came. I was in a bit of a hurry, so I called a cab.  \n\nWaiting on the cab, I dug into my pockets, felt a baggie, then decided \"ah, screw it,\" and pulled out the little pipe and the baggie of weed in my pocket, dropped it on the side table, and ran downstairs to catch my cab.  \n\nWe hit a red light 8 blocks from my apartment. I was behind the driver and angled such that I could see behind us in his rear-view mirror. I police cruiser pulls up behind us, and I get that reflexive twinge in my gut. I scoffed at myself a bit, thinking, \"I'm some dude in a cab, nothing to worry about.\"  The light turns green, the driver hits the gas, and the cop lights up his flashers.  \n\n\"The fuck?\" I think to myself. The cab pulls to the curb, directly in front of a fairly prominent landmark in my city, which was funded by a particularly ass-hatted software tycoon.  \n\n\"Passenger, get out of the car on the sidewalk.\" OK, seriously, what the hell? \"Get down on your knees. Now lay down on your stomach.\" A moment later, I feel a knee in my back and something pressed against the back of my head.  \n\nThe cop pulls me to my feet, pats me down. \"Do you have any weapons or drugs?\"  \n\n\"No, sir,\" seeing in my mind the pipe and weed on my side table.  \n\nThe cop pulls my wallet out, asks me where I'm going.  \n\n\"Just up to see a friend up the hill.\"  The cops seem to have relaxed quite a bit, given that one likely had a gun to the back of my head minutes before.  \n\nThey open up the back of the cruiser, and I sit down when they tell me to. I'm not in cuffs, which I take as a good sign.  \n\nThe divider between the front and back is down, and a moment later, a cop opens the front passenger door and sits down. He's got a clipboard and starts filling out a form. I hear another cop say, \"Nah, I don't think this is our guy. He lives right up the street.\"  \n\nAfter a couple minutes, the cop in the car looks up, looks at me and seems a little startled. He smiles, \"I guess I should put this up, huh?\" and up goes the divider.  \n\nI hear another voice saying, \"this isn't our guy.\" Things are looking up, I suppose.  \n\nAfter another couple minutes, the cop gets up from the passenger seat and opens the curb-side rear door. \"You can come out now, you can go.\" Seeing my look, he tells me, \"There was a robbery just up the street. Guy in dark pants and a black hoodie stuck the place up, then hopped in a cab.\" I'm still wearing my black work slacks and the black Hook-Ups hoodie I practically lived in back then.  \n\nThe cops head back to their cruiser. I turn around and the cab's still there, idling on the curb, rear right door still open. I hop back into the cab.  \n\nThe cabbie, an East African gentleman, turns around to look at me and says, \"I stop the meter for you.\"",

        "text": "This happened a few months ago and is easily one of my more popular stories.\n\nThe night had grown long and I had forgotten to eat (again), so I decide to leave the house around 10 to see what fast food places were still open. About halfway to my local university with no open restaurants, I notice a cop car tailing me. Taking note, I maintain the speed limit and obey the traffic laws. After turning off into another police jurisdiction (I live on the edge between two cities) the cop turns back and I continue my search. After determining that nothing is open, I begin turning to another street leading to my local 24 hour fast food place when I see another cop car tailing me. Taking note again, I begin prepping for a turn when he lights up. Frustrated that I may have missed something and was probably not getting dinner till 11, I turn onto a lightly used street. That’s when I noticed something off. There wasn’t one cop car. There were three. I turned on my emergencies, turned the radio off, and put the car in park. That’s when the spotlights start shining and I start pulling out my license and registration.\n\n“Driver, turn your vehicle off.”\n\nUh oh.\n\nI’m smart enough to follow the lawful order when I get the second of many to come.\n\n“Open your door slowly.”\n\nI comply.\n\n“Slowly leave the vehicle facing away from me.”\n\nOkay….\nHands are up and I’m out of the car, facing away from the blinding spotlight. Moving slowly and deliberately the entire time. No need to become another statistic.\n\n“Slowly walk backward towards my voice.”\n\nDo I need to put my left leg in and shake it all around? I stupidly think to myself.\nAfter following these orders, I get the scariest series of orders yet.\n\n“Get down on knee. Get down on your other knee. Cross your legs and put your hands on your head.”\n\nShit. I’m being detained. But why? I’ve only ever been pulled over for broken taillights and the like. This wasn’t my first time being a suspect, so I knew what NOT to do this time. I still freaked out when he put the cuffs on me.\n\nOne rough, quick motion and I feel the cuffs on my hand. As he grabs my second hand, I started a bit and dropped my glasses. He pulled me to my feet.\n\n“Sir, you are being detained.”\n\nNo shit. “What?! Why?!” Smooth.\n\n“This vehicle has been reported stolen.” He calmly stated as he begins searching my pockets.\n\n“WHAT?!?” Still calm as a cucumber. “This is MY car! My parents have the title and everything!”\n\nOfficer stops. “They do? Well, we’ll clear this up. In the meantime, I need you to come with me.”\n\nSo, about five minutes after being pulled over, I’m handcuffed in the back of a cop car.\n\nWhat is going on? They’re searching my car. Why has my car reported stolen? Did my parents accidentally buy a stolen car? No. We’ve owned it for a year. We just got a new registration! How am I going to pass my background checks now? Am I going to jail?\n\nThese thoughts and many more went through my mind before I was interrupted from my breakdown by the police radioing in to dispatch.\n\n“Dispatch, I need you to run the registration for [License plate number]”\n\n“Officer, the vehicle is registered to [Mom’s name]”\n\nThe car door opens.\n\n“Sir, who is [Mom’s name]?”\n\n“That’s my mom!”\n\n“That’s. Odd…. Hold on one more minute.”\n\nHe checks my ID and shuts the door.\n\nThe entire time I’m in the back of the car, more ideas are running through my mind. Was it a mistake? I’m not going to jail now. Will this show up on my record?\n\nThe radio turns on again.\n\n“Dispatch, I need you to check for a stolen vehicle with [License plate number]”\n\n“Officer, no stolen vehicle report for [License plate number]”\n\nWHAT THE EVERLOVING HELL IS GOING ON!\nThere isn’t a stolen vehicle report?! Why was I pulled over?!\n\nI see the officer run back to his car.\n\n“Dispatch. What state has the abbreviation MI?”\n\nWhat.\n\n“Officer, MI is the abbreviation for Missouri. Sorry, Michigan.”\n\nWhat.\n\n“Okay can you email me a stolen vehicle report for a vehicle with Michigan plates, with [License plate number]?”\n\n“Sending it now.”\n\nThe car door opens and all of the officers are standing around. They help me out, take the cuffs off, and the one who put them on me introduces himself. Then he pulls his phone out.\n\n“Okay. I think I’ve got it sorted out. Look at your license plate number. Now look at this stolen vehicle report.”\n\n“….That’s my license plate number.”\n\n“Yes, but you see a few lines under that it says the state is MI instead of TX.”\n\n“Wait. So there’s a car in Michigan that has my EXACT license plate number?”\n\n“Yeah, and when the officer ran your plate it just rang up as stolen. The officer did not notice that your plates didn’t match the registration. So when we ran your VIN, it didn’t match up with the report. After digging around, we double checked your story and it cleared. We’re sorry for the mix up, but you have to understand that everything we did was standard procedure for a stolen vehicle. No telling if there’s a dangerous criminal in the car or not.”\n\nSo that’s the story of how I learned that the system works (eventually). I’ve had a few friends and family tell me I should’ve, “stood my ground,” or “not let those pigs boss me around.” I know better. I know that cops are human and they make mistakes. It’s up to the system to put things right.",

        "text": "The first of hopefully many, in which I retell my otherwise boring stories in a way that they are entertaining to read without stealing the thunder of some of the more regular contributors.\n****************************************************\nSetting – half through an early summer super shift (1800-0600) in a district with some commercial and almost every kind of residential imaginable except for McMansions or farmland. Specific, I know.\n\nThe car was parked, window to window, with another of the district's units. My officer was parked with her early morning meal (lunch?), a salad, while the cop in the next car sucked on a Big Gulp. \"So why do you wanna be a cop?\" The question floated across the gap from my neighbor. I pondered, trying to think of a cool response. \"Um, honestly, fuck a desk job,\" I offered in return. \"Why'd you do it?\"\n\nA quick chortle greeted me in reply. \"Cuz I'm fucking stupid, that's why. What about you, Scotts?\" My officer, without looking up from her phone or salad, sarcastically retorted, \"Protect and serve, dude.  What the fuck else.\" The other cop jumped back in - \"Let me tell you, I haven't been doing this long but I've done some shit. I've had like 3 shootings, done chases, gotten suspended, gotten a commendation...This job is fucked but I still like it. I need to get into retail or some normal shit.\" Scotts shook her head. \"Always bragging,\" she muttered under her breath. The radio crackled over.\n\n\"Dispatch, 211.\" \"211, go ahead,\" came from the other car. \"211, proceed to offramp from I-7 at North Crest for a pedestrian in the roadway, breathing, but non-responsive.\"\n\n\"That's kinda weird,\" observed our round-faced companion. \"Yeah, wonder what the deal is,\" I queried out loud. \"Wanna go see?\" asked Scotts. I shrugged as a why-the-hell-not-the-shift-is-slow. Scotts jammed the lid back on her salad. \"213,\" as she keyed up. Dispatch acknowledged. \"Show us assisting 211, en route. Start medical.\" \"213, en route to assist 211, medical ETA 2 minutes to location.\"\n\n\"Shit, they'll beat us,\" I said. \"We're not running code, right?\" Both cops laughed. \"Not as such, no,\" said our lunch (or dinner?) companion. \"Get on the sideband, fool!\" Scotts shouted as the other guy dropped his rig into D and took off. We quickly fell in behind.\n\nKeeping up with this dude was a nightmare. Every cop drives like a bit of a hoon, sure, but the guy was not even rolling stops, just crushing through them, and just flipping lights at lights and cruising through at a mere 45 in the city bottom. Granted, it was basically deserted, but even Scotts, an aggressive driver, was complaining. \"When you make this job, don't do what he does, ok?\" I stashed the nugget of advice. \"You know who he reminds of?\" I asked her as we rolled another signal. She made a non-committal noise of acknowledgement. \"When was the last time you watched Super Troopers?\" Scotts laughed. \"Farva, right? We give him shit all the time. He's a dead ringer.\" \"I know!\" I responded. \"All he needs is the mustache and he's golden!\" Scotts grabbed the unit radio, set to the sideband. \"Toommmyyy,\" she called. \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Say *chicken fucker*.\"\n\nWe were greeted with clucking, followed by a vehement \"Chicken fucker!\", as we arrived on scene.\n\nThe EMT's had in fact beaten us, but only by a few seconds. They were still grabbing their go bags out of the back of the ambo. There was a dude face down on the highway offramp into the city, and a medic squatting next to him talking to him. Officer Farva shot us a look, and then all 3 of us proceeded over. The ambo driver met us halfway. \"The dude's smashed, right? Tell me this wasn't a vehicle vs. pedestrian. I'll be so pissed,\" bemoaned Farva to the driver. \"Nah, buddy, looks like you're free on the paper. Dude was just out drinking I guess. Donny told me he said he was walking home and needed a nap. Decided the offramp was comfy enough.\" The ambo driver shook his head. \"Sales stopped like three hours ago though,\" I less-than-helpfully observed. \"Yeah, but some of the bars in the city bottom stay on till 2,\" said Farva, clearly a regular patron on his off nights. \"Dude must have been going hard,\" added Scotts. Some friends to bail on him, I thought to myself. The other medics, who had since gotten the guy on his feet, wandered over.\n\n“Check this out,” said one of the medics. “This dude is one of Craig’s buddies.” There was a pause. “He was apparently out with Craig, like, tonight.” The driver’s face lit up. “That fucker called in sick! I knew he was lying. And he left his buddy out to sleep on the goddamn road?!” Visions of blackmail and firehouse scuttlebutt danced behind his eyes. “Oh dude, we have to give him some shit.” The other medic laughed. “I’m gonna call him, see if he won’t come pick him up or something.” All three EMT’s were now giggling like children. Farva wasn’t far behind, and in fact, neither was I. Just as it was getting good, the radio came over again.\n\n“Dispatch to 213.” “213, go ahead,” called back Scotts. “213, be enroute to incident in progress, unknown if domestic or disorderly conduct. 3596 Terrace Court. Nonpriority.” “Ahh shit, that’s what I get for trying to show the kid something interesting,” moaned Scotts. “Let’s go, now, in the car!” We started jogging the half block back to the cruisers. “I’ll finish here and come back you up,” called Farva. I had already grabbed a door handle and plopped myself in when he said this, and was then curious as to why he met my gaze with such a quizzical stare. He shouted at me, “Hey!” and then pointed. I turned to look at Scotts for an explanation, but was met with an empty drivers’ seat.\n\nFuck. Not-even-a-rookie-yet-mistake. Wrong damn car.\n\nI hopped out and sprinted back to Scotts, who was basically already driving off without me. “I fucked up,” I blurted as I tumbled in. “I saw,” sighed Scotts. “Put on your seatbelt.” She rocketed off while reeling off (for my benefit) details as they came through the computer. We were heading to a patch of the city’s Section 8, for a nonviolent domestic. The complainant had recently been released from jail, and come home to his girlfriend throwing all his clothes out the window into the yard. Scotts told me all this as we pounded potholes at 65. Thank God this wasn’t a cage car. “If it’s nonviolent…” I began. “Why the rush? To a total bullshit call? Just cuz we’re short at the moment plus I’m way out of position. We’re nowhere near the sector.” I mumbled my apologies. “Oh you’re fine, that shit in the bottom was hilarious. Plus I get to drive fast now.” Scotts clearly reveled in this part of the job.\n\nWe arrived in a cloud of brake dust (and smell) to the residence, a set of rowhouses. One was dark, and sure enough, had a huge pile of clothes out front. Next door, the door stood open, and three women sat on the porch. “Awwhhh hell, they here over Jamis’ clothes,” muttered one. The second woman stepped up as Scotts greeted her. “You here for what?” she queried. Scotts responded, “Someone’s throwing clothes? What’s the deal?” The third woman, already overwhelmed, threw up her hands and retreated inside the residence. “Is there a Jamis here?” Scotts asked. The first woman piped up, “That’s my son, but he live next door, ain’t here.” She waved her hand at the darkened neighbor’s with the clothes out front. The second woman cut her off. “Ain’t no problem. Y’all can leave. Git on.” Scotts sighed at the lack of cooperation. “I’m just trying to make sure everything’s alright for the night, so that no one is hurt or nothing.” She fell into a practiced speech, recited many a time only to fall on the deaf ears of this particular community. The second woman repeated her sentiment. “Ain’t nothing wrong. Y’all can go.” The first woman joined in. “He don’t even live here. He ain’t around.” Scotts looked at the women, then the pile of clothes next door. She turned to me. “Run to the car, check the computer. Make sure the address is right.” I jogged out and spun the laptop. Sure enough, the women were sitting on the stoop of 3598, and the pile of clothes was in front of 3596, which was dark. I walked back and shook my head. “Next door,” I said. Scotts groaned. Before she could ask the increasingly hostile women about the neighbor, the radio popped back in.\n\n“Dispatch to 213.” “213 go ahead.” “Complaintaint is refusing to cooperate with dispatcher, becoming belligerent. He’s withdrawing his complaint. Also you have a personal communication from dispatch.” “213 copy, we’re code 4 here.” Scotts clipped her radio back up and turned to the now giggling women. “Y’all have a good night,” she quipped with a small bow. The women began to cackle like some sort of urban harpies. “Yaaass! We was tellin you! That fool done mess hisself up now! Wait till they all hear bout this mess in the morning!” They stopped their carrying on to wish us a pleasant evening as we returned to the car. Scotts could hardly hide her laugher. “Oh man, Diane was pissed, if she’s gonna call me.”\n\nBefore the doors were even shut, Scotts' phone buzzed. She threw it on speaker so I could hear. The dispatcher’s voice leaked out of the iPhone – “Jamie! You won’t believe the nerve of this guy!” “Diane, calm down, okay, tell tell tell!” The dispatcher was sputtering through laughter. “So at first it was just like the reports, girlfriend threw clothes, yadda yadda. After I told him you got there, he got all shifty on me, what with him just being out of jail. I told him he needed to go to the door and talk with the officer, and he said he wouldn’t, that PD was corrupt, and then he disconnected.” Scotts rolled her eyes. “So what’s so funny?” she asked. “So Rick next to me called him back, right? He d-conned two more times, but then finally he told Rick, ‘I don’t even want that stuff anymore. It’s all dirty now. That chick on the phone, man? She wanna call me back so bad? That bitch can have it, straight up. Give her ALL my shit. You know what? Give her my number. Maybe she want a man or some shit, that’s what’s straight up.’ I sat astounded at this act of supreme playa-ness. The dude though he could ball hard enough to land the dispatcher that 2 minutes ago he was harassing? I turned to Scotts and said, “That’s some brave shit.” I added a dramatic pause. \n\nWe said in unison, “Straight up,” before bursting into laughter for about five minutes.\n",

I was grabbing the oh shit handle (door handle) because I was trying to keep my head off his shoulder as he was lecturing me never to attempt this in my car. I promised I wouldn't and then we heard a loud cracking sound which was the door panel coming off the door. We got up to speeds of 135 on that run and he didn't let me touch the door handle for 3 hours so it didn't break and Sarge didn't flip his lid. Fun times.",

        "text": "For a period of time, I worked as a Deputy Jailor (that's how my Sheriff spelled it, and it's since stuck) for a county in north east Georgia. I stayed there almost a year before having to leave due to personal issues. Personal being I got hit by a car and ended up in the hospital and decided that nope, I wasn't able to continue working there.  The Sheriff kept me on the books as a reserve Deputy, so I'd fill in from time to time when they needed extra help for a funeral or parade or similar.  \n\nIn any case, one weekend I got a call asking me to drop by. Apparently my uncle had been arrested and was facing charges.  Dropping by the jail, I get the skinny on what's going on as I dropped off a few of the necessities that he would need before his court date.  \n\nApparently he (my uncle) had driven up to the local grocery store while drunk, then proceeded to shoplift several steaks from the store. While they knew this was the case, the store had no video of it, and couldn't prove it, so that never came to charges. However it's how the arresting officer came to be there that's interesting.  Upon exiting the store, my uncle found to his dismay that he had locked his keys in his car.  So, after ditching what he had stolen, he did what any person in his situation would do. He called the police to come unlock the door.  When the officer arrived, he did the usual checks to ensure he was the owner of the vehicle, and discovered some very important things.  First, as stated, my Uncle was drunk.  Second, he didn't have a driver's license on him. Third, he didn't have proof of insurance on him.  So, the officer arrested him for the three, ending up with him being tossed in lockup.\n\nAbout four months later, when the circuit court Judge was sitting on the bench, his arraignment comes up.  So, I show up to sit in the audience and see just what would come of it.  The judge calls his name, and he heads up.  I then notice that somehow he'd found himself a lawyer.  One that looked rather familiar though I couldn't place the face.  The lawyer asks a few questions, mostly about whether he was drunk, and if it was his car, before dismissing him.  The lawyer then called the arresting officer to the witness stand.  Turning to him, he asked for a same recounting of the incident.  The officer gave his story, only to return a very blank stare when the Lawyer asks \"Did you ever unlock the car?\"  The officer replied that he didn't.  \"So, you never actually saw him in the vehicle, correct?\" The officer didn't answer right away, prompting the judge to ask him again. Eventually he agreed, he didn't unlock the door, and thus never saw him in the vehicle.\n\nAt that point the lawyer just turned to the judge, telling him that they had no reason to charge my Uncle with those charges, and asked for time served.  Turned out the lawyer was the local DA, which explained where I knew him from. He'd recently had an election. The case ended up being tossed out, my Uncle compensated for his time in the jail.  The officer though got ripped a new arse hole by the judge, right there on the stand.  \n\nNot long after that, I had to work a parade. While picking up my uniform, I noticed in the squad bay a note from the Sheriff that read quote \"Unlock first, then charge.\"",

        "text": "I was typing away at my computer when I felt a presence lingering just outside my bleary eyed gaze.\n\n“Hope you’re not closing out the Warren case!”\n\nI startled and turned to see my boss, standing in the entry to my cubicle. He had on a goofy grin and a thick stack of paperwork in his hand – neither a good sign.\n\n“Whoa! You startled me. Uh, yeah, actually. Just closing it out now. Sorry it’s a little late but the weekend and…” I trailed off as ran out of excuses but he didn’t seem to mind.\n\n“No problem, no problem...” He dropped the papers on my desk with a resounding thud. “Because he’s wanted again.”\n\n“What? I just locked him up on Thursday. He didn’t even make it a week! How?”\n\n“Don’t know the particulars but this is a ‘Fail to Appear’ warrant for all the underlying charges from before.”\n\nWarren had been wanted for multiple violent felonies and tracking him down and getting him into custody was more a matter of luck the first go-around – he was stopped by a cop working traffic and who also didn‘t buy the fake name Warren provided. I had spent hours on surveillance at his last known residence with nothing to show for it but was happy he was in custody none the less. The victim of Warren’s crimes had been receiving death threats up to the moment he was locked up and she was the first thing I thought of.\n\n“Ok. I’ll get on it again ASAP.” I then emailed the detective working the underlying case to compare notes and make sure the victim was ok. He informed me all was well, that both he and the victim knew there was a new warrant, and that no contact had been made with her by Warren. He also said he planned on moving the victim into a shelter until I located Warren – added stakes to an already stressful investigation.\n\nI saved my report mid-sentence and switched to our jail management program where I knew I’d find information that could help. Warren had registered his mom as his emergency contact, confirming what I had thought: he was probably shacking up with his parents again instead of the apartment I had presumed was his.\n\nMy next step was to confirm the address for Warren’s parents. I knew it was in the neighboring state, but was hoping it was on the closer side. The estimated hour and a half drive spit out by Google maps crapped all over that dream. It was going to be another long one and I grabbed my laptop and headed out the door.\n\nGoogle hadn’t accounted for the terrible drivers on my route (A single car wreck into the overpass support on the interstate, shutting down traffic in both directions? Really?!?) and when I finally made it to the house, my early start had transgressed into a mid-day disappointment. I knew I wasn’t totally out of luck, thanks to my innate ability to judge a target’s propensity for “felon time” but had hoped to arrive while much earlier. Felon time, by the way, is the reason evening and midnight shifts are so busy. Basically, your upstanding citizens are up and out of the house by ten o’clock at the latest on a normal day. That same group, the law-abiding ninety percent if you will, returns home mid-evening and is generally in bed before eleven PM. Felon time adjusts to prey on the ninety percent – wolves to their deer – and so, starts later in the day and goes longer into the night. Burglaries, robberies, stalking – it’s all easier when there are less witnesses around. I had pegged Warren as a mid to late hour felon time operator and as such had hope he’d still be bumbling around his parent’s home even as lunch time approached.\n\nAn hour or so passed with absolutely no movement at the home. I was a fairly large brick colonial in a neighborhood I thought would riot if they knew they had a wanted, violent felon in their midst. As I was crunching through my bag of carrots, the door cracked open and a very cautious Warren peered out. He scanned up and down the street then ducked back in and shut the door. I immediately pulled out my phone and began drafting the message that would invite all my buddies into the fray. Warren peeked out again and stepped onto the front stoop. He glanced around once again before pulling out a pipe and packing his weed into the bowl. Wake and bake at noon – the man was living the dream.\n\nMy phone buzzed with positive replies from my squad mates, all saying they were on their way, and I watched Warren puff out smoke and continuously scan for any sign of trouble – for a wolf, he was very nervous. He finished up and headed back into the home and I began arranging for a local officer to meet nearby and assist in the arrest. The problem with locking up a fugitive in another state is that, due to several state and federal laws, it’s not as easy a task as just finding them and driving them home. The wanted subject has to be charged locally and given the opportunity to fight extradition, so the inclusion of local officers is a necessary and sometimes annoying part of the process. It seemed as though this instance was leaning more towards the annoying than anything else as I dialed the non-emergency number for the local police and identified myself.\n\n“So, you sayin’ you need a poh-leece there to lock a guy up?” The operator sounded bored and angry, if not a little dim-witted.\n\n“No. I’ll do the locking up, I just need an officer to take custody of the prisoner after and take him to your jail to charge him as a fugitive.”\n\n“So, you need a transport? Are you really a cop?”\n\nI think she could hear my hand smack my forehead and if not, she could definitely hear the annoyance in my voice as I continued. “Yes. I can provide my badge number, supervisor’s name and number, my jurisdiction’s number, my email address, hell – I think there’s even a picture of me on the website from our last awards ceremony if you’d like that!”\n\n“Nah, it’s ok. I just gotta make sure.” I was confused how questioning my legitimacy but failing to follow up on the line or reason was “making sure.”\n“So, can I get an officer? Maybe to stage at Mayflower and Santa Maria, a block away from the target address? I can raise him on your radio channel when he arrives. Or you can give him my cell number. Whatever is easiest for you.”\n\n“Well, the easiest would be if you just take this guy to the jail.”\n\n“I… you don’t… I’m not authorized to do that. I have to turn him over to a local officer, with local arrest powers…”\n\n“Well, if you a cop, you can arrest, correct?”\n\n“Not in this state, no. Strike that – I can arrest, just not charge locally. And I sure as hell can’t violate the Constitution and just drive this guy across the state border.” I pulled the phone away from my ear and did some Lamaze breathing to calm myself down. Warren’s house was still quiet and an old lady walking a shar pei gazed quizzically at me through my windshield. I smiled and waved to her and rejoined my phone call. The operator was in the middle of a monotonous drone.\n\n“… until a hour or so and even then you need to be able to sa-splain the case and why you’re not doing your job and then maybe he can help and if not I don’t know what to tell you because if you really is a poh-leece and you can’t arrest people I don’t know why you is even here trying to lock up people irregardless of where it is and who you is.”\n\nThe line went silent except for the occasional background laugh or cough and I contemplated my next move in this complicated verbal chess match. “So… you’re sending a cop?” I opted to ignore her previous statement and rewind us a bit.\n\n“Yes.” She said. “Anything else?” The irritation was thick on her voice.\n\n“Nope! Have a great day!” I hung up and breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nMy squad mates began trickling in, most complaining about traffic on the way, and I held them off a bit so as not to have too many cars cluttering the nervous Warren’s otherwise tranquil cul-de-sac.\n\n“Hey, EMR; did you call local PD?” My boss asked over the radio.\n\n“Yeah, and it was a hard pill for them to swallow.”\n\n“Ok. Did they give you an ETA? A cruiser just rolled by, not sure if it’s yours or just on patrol.”\n\n“She said an hour or two about an hour ago. I gave them your location to respond to.”\n\n“Well, this must not be him then. He rolled past.”\n\nOn cue, I saw a marked cruiser nose into the four way intersection behind me.\n“Don’t turn this way, don’t turn this way, don’t turn this way…” I pleaded out loud. He obviously wasn’t picking up my psychic vibe.\n\nThe cruiser turned and crept past my car, the cop scanning the homes and looking for addresses, and came to a stop in front of Warren’s house.\n\n“Really?” I muttered.\n\nAfter a moment, the brake lights flicked off and the cruiser crept away again, completing an excruciatingly slow turn-around in the cul-de-sac and slowly pulling back on to the road where he came from.\n\n“Boss, grab this uniform. He’s our guy and just parked in front of the target house.” I realized my voice was bristling with annoyance but didn’t care. The curtain on Warren’s house was still settling from his peek out. He knew the police were near. “We’re going to have to step this up, target saw the cruiser.”\n\nBefore I knew it, we were stacked on the door. I was in the lead position and, once I got the affirmative nod from the guy behind me, rapped on the door. I left my thumb on the peep hole after and held my gun at my side. Footsteps, then the deadbolt being disengaged, and the door opened. A red-eyed teenager stood in the door, still clad in his socks and a pair of basketball shorts and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. After one PM and he’s just waking up? I guessed he was in the felon time training program.\n\n“Come on out here.” I told him, and I gripped his wrist as I walked to the back of the line with him. My team entered and did their thing as I de-briefed him. “Where’s Warren?”\n\n“Who?” The kid’s breath smelled of booze and weed. He couldn’t have been over sixteen.\n\n“Warren. Is he your uncle?”\n\n“Don’t know him.” The kid was looking around, annoyed by our presence.\n\n“Dude. He’s here. You want to get sucked into his mess? If you lie, I can charge you.” I thought back to my conversation with the operator but didn’t add “well, not technically but I can get someone else to … maybe… if they’re feeling helpful.”\n\n“Whatever, man. If he’s in there, I don’t know where he is.” The local cop walked up and I had him take over babysitting duty as I went in to assist in clearing the house. Ten minutes of bob-and-peeking, pie-ing off rooms, and issuing commands to ‘make himself known,’ we still didn’t have our man.\n\n“Well. I guess he could have scooted out the back door.” Jim said as we conducted a secondary search. Mark was upstairs with Warren’s sick father.\n\n“So, what you’re saying is if he was here, he’d be in the basement watching TV?” Warren’s father was laid out on the bed. The room smelled of illness and urine and his color was indicative of the severity of his condition.\n\n“Yes.” He croaked. “I can’t get around much, but he hasn’t left the house since he got out of jail as far as I know.”\n\nMark nodded to me, indicating I should re-check the basement. I made my way down the two flights of stairs and met several guys standing in a circle, cracking jokes and relaxed.\n\n“Have we double checked down here?” I asked, looking around the room.\n\n“Triple.” One of the guys barked.\n\nI began another search, much to the annoyance of the crew in the circle. “He had to run out the back, man.”\n\n“I just want to be sure.” I noticed the couch, oddly spaced six inches off the wall.\n\n“Feel free.” One of the guys scoffed before mentioning the local football team and starting a new conversation.\n\nI knelt on the couch and leaned over the back of it. Two wide eyes peered back at me and I jumped back. “Show me your hands! Don’t move!!” I tried to draw my gun but it was caught in my thigh rig by the awkward angle of my leg. The circle of conversationalists sprung to action and bounded over, grabbing Warren’s arms and trapping me in the middle of the scrum. I stepped back and my foot landed on the TV remote, sliding on the berber carpet and putting me into full splits. I felt a release of pressure in my groin area and feared the worst – I was about to go out on 66 2/3’s thanks to a heinous groin injury.\nWarren landed face down next to me, eyes still wide and clearly deep in the fight or flight zone. I rolled to my side and knelt to a sitting position while he was cuffed and searched. I tested my hips, swaying back and forth on my haunches, and then knelt to a sitting position before standing up. There was, fortunately, no pain. All at once I felt relief two fold – I was uninjured and my guy was in cuffs.\n\n“Dude, your balls.” One of the guys on the Warren-pile was staring at my crotch. I glanced down and saw it – a catastrophic wardrobe malfunction. My shorts were split from crotch to the mid-thigh hem, my Hanes boxer briefs peering out like a wanted felon checking for police.\n\n“Shit.” I said. I tried to pull my shirt down under my belt but there wasn’t enough fabric to hide anything south of the zipper. Warren was stood up and began asking questions.\n\n“Why y’all here? I ain’t do nuffin!” He yelled.\n\nWe took him outside and I looked for the uniform while trying my best to keep my legs pressed firmly together. “Anyone see the local guy?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, he took off a minute ago.” Ted said as he passed by. “Oh, and your balls are showing.”\n\n“Yeah, thanks.” I was feeling my temper flare. “Hey, boss!”\n\nThe boss was walking by, un-velcroing his vest. He glanced over.\n\n“The local guy took off on me. Any suggestions?”\n\n“Yeah. Call for another. Oh, and get a new pair of pants.” He turned and got in his car.\n\nI took a hold of Warren, made sure he had no more fight in him, and placed him in my car. The group that had been chatting in the basement re-formed at the end of the driveway. I figured they may have a more helpful suggestion.\n“Call ‘em back, I guess.” One offered. “And quit showing your dong to the neighborhood!”\n\n“Stop looking at my junk.” I retorted, realizing I was about to duel another potentially unfriendly operator. I stomped back to my car and updated Warren.\n\n“We might be here a while. I have to wait for a local cop to come back so he can charge you here.”\n\n“What? Why? You’re a cop, right? Why don’t you just charge me? Can’t you arrest me? Or just drive me back to your state. I don’t care.”\n\nI stared at him over my phone, half the numbers for non-emergency dialed. “How about you don’t start with me, ok?” A cool blast of air conditioning blew onto my nether region making a weak attempt to cool my temper.",

I didn't think too much of it because I had three rooms left to clear.   \nAfter the range was called cold, my instructor told me to come straight to the hostage room.   \n\"Know what you did wrong here?\"  he asked.  \n\"Seems like I got him square in the head without harming the hostage.\"  \n\"Well...yeah.  But most officers wouldn't risk the shotgun on this one.\"   \nNo joke, hostage taker didn't have much of a head left and none of the pellets hit the hostage.  The instructors even admitted how badass it was.  But I was still advised to try it with the pistol next time.  ",

The interior of the car is a smoke box and we are all very stoned. After we are done smoking J pulls out a laser pointer, not one of those shitty red ones you can buy at the dollar store, but a green one with a beam so powerful you can point it at the moon. After a few minutes of waving it around in the smoky car one of us decides to start pointing at people and cars. A terrible idea... but we were young and dumb, that's all I can say. Flash forward 20 minutes and we are cut off on the road by some guy on the bypass so we retaliate by shining this laser into his car... but for some reason we didn't stop. We followed this poor guy around for another 20 minutes shining this laser into his car. Unbeknownst to us this guy was on the phone with the cops and we were following him right into an ambush that they were setting up for us. We pass a cruiser that is parked on the side of the road, so we pull off onto the nearest exit, and we are immediately surrounded on all sides by over a dozen police cars. We turn off the engine and wait, we are interrogated by several cops while the victim is talking to others. The cops come back to tell us that we are lucky the man didn't want to press charges and we are freed to go.  ",

        "text": "“So, what do you have tucked up your sleeve to get us out of this training?” Lt was looking forward to that morning’s First Aid training as much as I was. \n\n“You’re the boss, you should have the answers.” It seemed as though we were training more than actually locking up bad guys and the schedule was becoming a bit of a burden. \n\n“Well, you’re the detective: find somebody for us to lock up.” \n\nMy cases had been sitting untouched on my desk for a few days and the Lt had a point – I was itching to get back to the work I was getting paid for. “I haven’t had a chance to work up my stuff but I’ll make some calls and see if anyone has any leads we can use as an excuse to get some action.” It didn’t take long; my second call looked like it may bear fruit. \n\n“Yeah, man. I could use some help. I just got a lead off LPRs on a violent pedophile case I’ve been working.” Stan was the kind of guy who would never ask directly for help but if offered it, would accept it graciously. “It’s a bit out there, though.” Stan gave me an address for a hotel about an hour and a half away. “If you’d like to start coming my way, I’m only about fifteen minutes away. I’ll keep you updated.”\n\nI pitched it to Lt and he put on a false frown. “Sounds like we’ll have to skip first aid.”\n\nWe were on the interstate in no time and had picked up a couple more members for our caravan. After several miles traveling at normal speeds and talking trash to each other over the side band radio channel, Stan called me back. \n\n“Hey EMR. Hate to do this, but are you still coming?” I immediately assumed he was calling us off and glanced at the clock, confirming we were still early enough to make our dreaded First Aid class. \n\n“Yeah, about five of us now. Is it a no-go?”\n\n“No, actually. He’s here, but I’m not sure for how much longer. He should be checking out by eleven. You think you guys can pick it up?”\n\n“Pick it up? As in, ‘run lights and sirens for fifty miles into another state’? Yeah, I think we can do that.” I’m sure he could hear my grin over the phone.\n\n“Ok, great. I’m going to call a local cop to help on perimeter until you all get here.”\n\nI grabbed my radio and gave the update. “Stan says target is on scene, but he might be leaving in…” I checked the clock again, “about 45 minutes. He’s asking us to step it up.” \n\nWithout responding over the radio, the car in front of me lit up his lights and throttled forward. We were tearing down the road and making record time when Stan called back again. \n\n“Dude.” He began, his voice a bit shaky and excited. “He just called down to the front desk confirming checkout was at eleven. How far off are you?”\n\nI glanced at my GPS. “About ten minutes.”\n\n“Ok. Hurry. I may have failed to mention this guy was former military and his wife can’t account for two of the guns from their collection. I really don’t want to grab him solo.”\n\n“I’ll tell the guys, we’ll be there as soon as we can.” We were traveling secondary roads by that point and the drivers were predictably slow to get out of our way. \n\nAfter what seemed like a frustrating eternity, we finally pulled onto the service road where the hotel was and shut down our equipment. I could smell my brake pads before I even opened my door to get my gear out of the trunk. We suited up and raised Stan on the radio. \n\n“Stan, we’re on scene. Where do you want us?”\n\n“Hey guys. I’m dressed down still; just have my soft vest on. If I could get one of you to marry up with the deputy out back and the rest make your way to the lobby, we’ll approach the room.”\n\nLt waved one of the guys to take the spot with the deputy and the rest of us started for the lobby. \n\n“Hold up, I’m going to grab the shield.” I trotted back to the cruiser and pulled the clunky ballistic shield out. We rarely used the shield on normal warrants because it was so cumbersome and heavy. If you haven’t seen one, it’s basically a Kevlar sheet sandwiched between rigid plastic with a Lexan viewing portal and lights affixed to the front. I somehow always seemed to draw the short straw and got stuck with it. \n\nWe met Stan in the lobby and came up with our plan: one of us was going to break off and take the stairs on the opposite end of the hallway from where the elevator would drop the rest of us. The elevator crew would then make the approach, me with the shield in front, and be joined by the stairway unit to knock. Stan was given a room key but we were going to give the guy an opportunity to come voluntarily first, protecting his fourth amendment rights and all.\n\nThe elevator dinged and I got the squeeze on my shoulder indicating we were ready to move. The unit in the stairs gave the affirmative over the radio he was set and we began the deliberate paced walk to the door. I had my gun drawn and cocked around the side of the shield in a way I could still get a good sight picture. It was as awkward as it sounds. \n\nWe got to the door and paused, listening to the TV inside but hearing nothing else to indicate the guy was inside. Stan crept up beside me and nodded, indicating he was about to knock. We were set back so we were out of site of the peep hole and he leaned in, tapping on the door with a quick knock-knock. \n\n“Who is it?” A gruff voice called out in reply. \n\n“House keeping. You need towels?” Stan answered, in falsetto for some reason. We heard shuffling in the door and I shot Stan a ‘why did you use that voice?’ look. He shrugged back and then diverted his attention once more to the door. \n\n“No. Go away.”\n\nStan sighed and reached out again. Knock-Knock. “House keeping!”\n\n“I’m ok. I don’t need anything. Leave me alone.”\n\nStan’s shoulder slumped and he pulled out the key. He leaned over to the handle and slid it in, getting an angry beep and flashing red light in response to his attempt. “shit.” He muttered.\n\n“I SAID I’M OK. DO I NEED TO CALL THE MANAGER?!?” Heavy footsteps stormed back to the door. \n\n“Mark, open up. It’s the police. We have a warrant.” Stan called through the door.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The police. We have a warrant for your arrest and have you surrounded. Come on out and I can explain more.”\n\nThere were several seconds of silence before the target replied. “If this is about my daughter and her friend, I can explain.”\n\n“Mark, we aren’t here to hear your case, just take you to someone who will. Come on out and we’ll get this thing taken care of.” More silence, then retreating footsteps. \n\n“Mark, come back to the door and come out with your hands visible.” \n\nI was examining the door to gauge our ability to force entry since the key was a dud: metal door with a metal frame. Even with a ram, it would take several well placed hits to knock it in, giving Mark plenty of time to do whatever it was he was thinking about doing. \n\n“Mark?” Stan was trying to keep the communication up but not having luck.\n\n“I HAVE A GUN!!” Mark roared from the other side of the door. “IF YOU COME IN, I’M GOING TO BLOW YOU ALL AWAY!” There was an odd metallic noise that may have been a rifle racking a round. \n\n“Pull back pull back pull back!” I hissed and we began creeping away from the threshold. \n\n“SHIT!” Stan yelled as we ducked into the portico with the ice machine. “What now?”\n\n“Evacuate the surrounding rooms?” I suggested over my shoulder, shield still up and gun trained on Mark’s door. \n\n“Yeah. Tim, run down to the front desk and have them call the rooms on this floor. Tell the occupants to open the door and we’ll come get them with the shield. Stan, start working on getting more guys here. I know we have some tied up in training but call that crap off. We need bodies. Make sure the perimeter guys know we have an armed barricade now.” \n\nWe began acting on the plan and soon phones were ringing up and down the hall. A few doors opened slowly and nervous eyes began peering into the hall. \n\n“Mick, come with me. We’re gonna grab this elderly couple first and get them to the elevator.” Mick lined up behind me and I quickly moved just beyond the couple’s door, blocking them with the shield while Mick described the plan to evacuate and keeping my gun on Mark’s door. My arm was beginning to ache but the adrenaline was still helping maintain my strength. We walked backwards past the ice machine and to the elevators, picking up another couple and their kids who had popped out in the meantime. We continued the routine for several trips, picking up people as they appeared. Luckily, only about a one in five of the rooms on the floor had occupants at the time. \n\n“Let’s reposition to a room where we have a better line of site on the target.” Lt suggested. We did so and I backed in last, shield bearing arm now shaking with fatigue. \n\n“Jesus, someone take my place.” I called over my shoulder. Mick stepped up and we transitioned before I started massaging my forearm. I glanced around the room. “Who did we pull out of here?” I asked Mick.\n\n“That hot blonde chick, the one in the pajamas.” Mick answered. I remembered her scared face vaguely, having been a little more concerned with not getting shot at by the maniac across the hallway. \n\nLt was glancing out the window which over looked the front courtyard. “Cavalry is coming.” I took a look too and confirmed units from several local jurisdictions as well as more of our task force co-workers were gearing up in the parking lot. \n\n“Why, do you think, would a single girl need this many condoms?” Lt asked out of the blue. He was staring at the nightstand and a massive stack of assorted condoms. “And what’s with the leash?” A folded-leather instrument, most definitely not a leash but more in the realm of rider’s crop lay nestled underneath a pile of ripped-open condom wrappers on the floor. “And Jesus, Does she have a whole suitcase for underwear?” A pink rolling suitcase was open and on the desk, lacey underthings piled high on top of more durable looking, black leather accoutrements underneath. \n\n“Damn it guys, why do I have to hold the shield!” Mick was doing his best not to take his attention from the task at hand but Lt was making it difficult. \n\nWe were holed up in the hooker’s room for a couple hours while a plan was made to force entry. Attempts to get a hold of Mark on the phone all failed. The PA from outside in the back parking lot was answered by him closing his blinds. Me, Mick, and Lt took turns on the shield and each rotation, I felt less and less capable of pulling the trigger on my gun, let alone keeping the shield raised. Then a thought: “Lt, bring me that chair.”\n\nHe did and I turned it round, back facing the hallway out the door, and propped the shield on it at just the right height to still see out the window. “Crap: should have thought of that an hour ago.” Mick said. \n\nThen, across our radio, we got an update. “Delta SWAT is en route for entry to a secondary room. Primary, you guys good? Any movement?”\n\n“Negative,” Lt answered, “all quiet at the target door.” \n\n“10-4. Bravo SWAT will be there to relieve you in five.”\n\n“Phew!” Mick said, “Glad I’m not going to have to hold that thing again.”\n\n“Yeah, thanks.” I replied, still gazing at the offending door though the window. \n\nWe were relieved shortly thereafter and SWAT ended up taking over as primary entry. They have cooler toys and are always itching to use them in the real world. They ended up blowing a hole in the adjoining wall with some directional explosives after distracting Mark at the door. He was taken into custody with no incident and dragged out to Stan’s cruiser for transport. \n\n“He had no fight in him.” One of the SWAT guys told me and Stan. “No guns either, just a bluff.”\n\n“What’s with his neck?” Mark had raw red lines on his neck. \n\n“Oh, he was sawing away at his neck when we made entry. Plastic knife though, didn’t get through the skin.” The SWAT guy chuckled and stomped off. \n\n“Plastic knife? Really?” Stan asked his arrestee. \n\n“I tried to do it with a plastic bag over my head, but was too scared. I kept pulling it off at the last minute.” \n\n“Well, that’s going to be an issue in jail. Rubber room for you, man.” I said as Mark was placed in to the backseat of Stan’s cruiser, rubbing my still sore forearms. \n\nStan noticed my self-massaging technique. “Oh, what’s the matter? Noodle arms a little sore from holding the big bad shield for a few minutes.”\n\n“More like a couple hours.” I scoffed. “But thanks for getting me out of first aid.” \n\nLt walked up. “Yeah, thanks Stanny boy.” He turned to me. “Psych is direct you’re en route.” \n\n“Psych?” I asked, confused with the direction things had turned. \n\n“Yeah, for the bad guy. You and Stan got to get him cleared before the jail up here will accept him. Enjoy the OT!” He started to walk away and I began to fume. \n\nAnother few hours of torture awaited me and I knew I had to get even with Lt for giving me the bum assignment somehow. Luckily, I had the First Aid instructor’s number and email saved in my phone. During the few hours sitting in a hospital waiting room I was able to arrange a nice, extended version of the ‘unfortunately missed’ first aid class for my superior officer to attend. I’m sure it was slightly less tortuous than the Maury Povich re-runs I had to endure at the hospital, but I felt vindicated none-the-less.\n",

Little background on the call:\n\nA shooting (later designated a homicide) comes out over the radio at a familiar address. I respond and tell dispatch I'm en route. As more information is given over the radio, the victim and suspect become pretty clear to those of us familiar with the neighbor dispute. I arrive on scene and start giving locations for additional units to post, in case there's a standoff with the obviously armed suspect. I check on the victim, who was shot 9 times, and render what medical aide I can. Two more units show up and I tell medical the scene is safe so the can come get the still alive victim. Myself and one of the others attempt to apprehend the suspect but he's barricaded himself in the house. \n\nFast forward to the point where SWAT takes over. I return to my vehicle, which has been used as a tie off point for crime scene tape in the inner crime scene. I'm sitting in my car, typing up the preliminary report while the stand off is going on. I'm out of the line of site from the suspects house and what not. Jamming out to music, hamming keys to get it done. \n\nI feel that pressure, and lean hesitantly. Then, I instantly regret my decision. I shit myself. And not like the \"I squeezed as it happens so I just need to wipe\" type situation. It's the \"those are ruined\" type situation. Wouldn't be such a big deal if I could drive my car somewhere...home, gas station, empty woods. But I can't, it's attached to the crime scene. \n\nI call my Sgt and let him know I have to go to the gas station to use the bathroom, but I need to borrow someone else's car. His response was \"just go off in the woods\" since it was about midnight and dark. I responded with \"Yeah Sarge, it's not like that. I NEED to use a bathroom.\" So he starts laughing and tells me he'll send the rookie over to let me take the rookies car. The new guy gets there and turns his car over to me. \n\nI drive to the gas station, doing my best to hover in the kids car. Get to the gas station, waddle into the bathroom, unhook my 28lbs of gear, drop the pants and sit down. Yup, underwear are definitely ruined, possibly a worse mess than the crime scene. I stay seated, pull my boots, pants and underwear off, and subsequently throw my underwear in the bathroom trash can. When it's all said and done, Im driving back to the crime scene and tell myself \"under no circumstances, are you to fart again until safely in new underwear.\"\n\n\nTL;DR: First officer on scene at homicide, shit my pants, drive another persons car with shit pants.

        "text": "So, this took place about two or three months ago. As everyone likes some background, I'm an EMS student, volunteer firefighter, and a month or so before this event, had bought my first car.\n\nTo set the stage, I finished my Monday classes (the longest day of my week) and realized that I was running later than normal. I have to drive ~45 minutes from school to my house and being late wasn't exactly an option. I live near a military base (my dad did 22 years and retired in April) and the roads are straighter and with less traffic than the normal roads, saving me loads of time each day.\n\nUntil that point, I loathed the speed limit (I still do, I just do 4 over nowadays) and would, if running late, do 10 or 15 over without realizing and slowing back down, realizing I'd be late, speeding up, rinse and repeat. I make it down one of two main military/back roads without an issue, making sure to keep to one lane position (unless I'm avoiding a giant pothole), not pass a ton of people, and generally not drive like I have a death wish (aside from the speed, of course).\n\nI make it most of the way down that second road and, by this point, had come upon a line of 4-6 vehicles who were doing ~80. I rejoice in that I won't be late and take my spot behind this pack. We crest a hill and I spot a car that's different. It's white with a thinner-than-normal push bar, internal lightbar, and a Police sticker that's hard to see from far away mounted on the hood (though plain as day on the side). I can't quite place it but something tells me it's off. I slow down a tad and the group in front of me slows down for a person who needs to turn off of the road. As I'm passing the strange car, I see the hood sticker and the side Military Police sticker and I know that I'm cooked.\n\nHe turns on his lights and turns around and pulls up behind me. I hope that he'll go for the cars in front (who are still doing ~75 in a 55), though I, being in the back, am pulled. I pull to the side of the road, put it in park, pop the hazards, and start trying to calm myself down. My fire chief works for the county DA's office (or something similar, I know he does law-related work but isn't an officer) and he tends to know about tickets that his guys receive before they can tell him. Part of me wanted to feel my pulse to see how fast my heart was beating, though I was more concerned with keeping my hands on the wheel than indulging in my curiosities.\n\nHe approaches my window and informs me that he pulled me because I was doing 76 when the speed limit was 55 and asks if I understand. I say something along the lines of \"yes sir,\" and wait for him to continue. He asks for my driver's license (had it under a year at that point), registration, and proof of insurance. I grab the registration and proof of insurance from my glove box before realizing that my wallet is in the same pocket as my knife (it's an SOG with a seat belt cutter, window punch, etc). My voice shakes as I tell him that I have a knife and will be putting it in the passenger's seat. He says okay and I slowly (can't emphasize how much I'm shaking at this point) pull the knife from my pocket and slowly drop it in the driver's seat before reaching back for my wallet. I hand him my DL and he thanks me before walking back to his car. At some point during that exchange, a county officer pulled up and had a brief non-verbal exchange with the officer who pulled me over.\n\nWhat seems like an eternity passes before he exits his car again and is on his radio as he approaches my window. He hands me back my information and says that he's not going to give me a ticket but that I need to slow down. I thank him and he returns to his car. He pulls away (back towards the base) and I sit there for a second to try to calm down and pull out shortly afterwards to make the last 10-15 minutes of my drive home. Turns out that it was a miscommunication and that I had nothing to be late for, of course.\n\nAnd that's why, despite everyone who wants to go 80 on those back roads, I go no more than 5 over and haven't been troubled yet. I know it's tamer than some of the stories on here (like the on-duty wreck, the lunchbox bomb, etc) but it was the most terrifying moment of my life at the time.\n\nTL;DR: I get pulled over for the first time and have some weird form of pseudo-seizure the entire time.",

Before I hit my lights my sgt comes over the radio.\n\nSgt:  Wutnow55\nMe:  Go ahead sir\nSgt: There is a possible 10-50 (Motor Vehicle Collision) on the highway in front of the PD I heard it not quite sure what you got.\nMe: 10-4 I will be enroute\n\nCommunications: Wutnow55 we are being advised by a bystander that the driver could be -67 (Deceased).\n\n Luckily I was only a quarter mile down the highway so I hit my lights went around the poor soccer mom that I was going to pull over.  My thoughts raced on what could have possibly gone wrong and what am I going to see?  As I pull up to the scene all I can see is a tractor trailer with a load of freshly cut logs and another tractor trailer behind it.  The first vehicles load of logs were pertruding through the rear vehicles cab still neatly stacked.  As I ran to the rear vehicle I saw a man open the cab door he turned ghostly white and slammed the door shut, I could hear the cries and shrieks of a woman that stood in view of the mess in the cab.  I have never heard such blood curdling screams in my life.\n\nAs i approached the door of the cab I saw a log 8 inches in diameter sticking out of the back coated in blood.  I opened the door, my eyes gazed upon the driver he was whiter than snow.  The massive log had impaled him the lower left side of his chest.  His groans echoed in the cab his eyes wide open but he was still concious and his chest was still compressing and decompressing.  I placed my hand on his right shoulder at the edge of his neck.\n\nMe: Sir can you hear me, it's going to be alright.  Wutnow55 to CCOM it is a confirmed pin in.  Wake up sir stay with me.\"\n\nHis eyes glanced over at me for a  moment they were still widely ajar.  I jumped out of the cab and sprinted to my car I grabbed a pair of gloves and hurriedly returned to the cab.  My ears were ringing from the awful shrieks of the woman only a few feet from the cab.  The driver was still fighting to live, the only thought that came to mind was to just let him go.  The log was pertruding through him and the cab it would be impossible to move it in time to stop the bleeding and allow him to breathe.  I rubbed his shoulder in that moment it was the only way i felt i could tell him it was ok to give up, it was his time to go.  His head slumped forward i was speechless i couldnt muster any words.  A few moments later his chest stopped moving I checked his pulse, there was nothing.\n\nI stepped out of the truck I felt defeated, death had won that day.  I ripped my gloves off and just stood there, fuming. why didn't he just use his damn brake? Why did he have to rear end the truck? Just why?  The shrieking woman continued bellowing\n\nShrieking woman:  \"omg he's dead he's dead cover him up.\"\n\nMe: Mam you need to get the hell out of the roadway now, don't look if you don't want to see. (Of course I heard EMS and fire coming I knew they would put a sheet over him and I shut the cab door.)\n\nI surveyed the wreckage what a horrible collision and what a horrible day.  I came to terms at that moment that I did everything I could for that fella I sat with him until he left this world.  Nothing would change what had happened and I learned something that day, that I loved my job.  I hate that he passed and i felt sad for his family.  But in law enforcement no day is routine in mere seconds a life can be changed dramatically and you have to be there to help them through it.  This is the day that I knew I picked the right career I want to be there for people in their darkest hour the time when no one else is there.\n\nTL:DR Tractor trailer with load of logs is rear ended by another tractor trailer.  Driver gets impaled which results in me working my first fatality collision.",

        "text": "I work in a State Prison I have for about 5 mounths, so as the inmates say Im a \"new boot.\" The prison I work at is the worst in the region for cell phone contraband drug contraband and staff assaults.  \n\nEvery morning I wake up at 3:30 am, I'm ready and out the door by 4 am, and I'm at work by 5:20 am. At 5:30 am my lieutenant and sergeants brief us on what happened the night before. Around 6 am my shift leaves turnout and head to our assign buildings for the day. 12 arrive at 6:30 am we conduct a count of our inmates.\n\nAt around 6:45 I had just finished counting 2 row of F pod and was headed down the stairs into the day room. (At my prison there are two box to a cell 21 cells to a row(floor) and 2 rows to a pod. A pod has a balcony going around 3 walls and a large un-air conditioned warehouse type day room with benches tvs and tables. On one end of the day room the control officer has a window into the pod, the wing door is also located on that end. At the other end is the stairs to get onto 2 row) as I was headed down the stairs I heard the enormous offender (imagine John Henry but white and a skinhead) in cell 212 calling out \"boss man... hey yo boss man dont be a hoe come over here\" this being medium custody I assumed I was aboiy to get piss splashed in my face but I walked away anyways. \"Whats up man\" I said as I got close making sure to stay to one side of the metal grated window on the door. \"What time is it\" he asked \"like 6:45 man, why whats up?\" \"not much I'm just bored, hey why did the pirate go on vacation?\" He asked, taken off guard I replied \"I don't know why\" \"For some ARRR and ARRR\" I stared at him for a minute, he had a big goofy smile on his face and was laughing at his own joke \"Man that's one of the corniest joke I've ever heard... I like it\" I said as I started to laugh and walked away thinking to myself Im glad that guys not a being a dick I would hate to fight him.\n\nJump ahead about 15 minutes and 1 Captain, 1 Sergeant, and 3 Officers come into the building and say somthing to the control officer. My partner and I on the floor were completely unconcern with it. This sort of thing happens all the time, GI (gang inteligence) orders shakedown in addition to a random cell searches for the day.\n\nMy partner and I are looking at paperwork and I look up just in time to see a small black object flying out of cell F221 just at the top of the stairs and the giant skinn head appearing to trip over somthing. I think \"what the fuck, why is his door open?\" In that moment he recovers and turns to face the officers who were out of sight in his cell. This all happened in milliseconds. I respond at a sprint up the stairs my radio attached to my duty belt buy only the clip on the back flys away as I run.\n\nI get to the top of the stairs in time to see the giant skinn head coming out the door at me. Fuck I think, I make a grab for him and pull just as he is pushed from behind. Luckily for us he loses his balance and myself and one other officer end up on top of my him as we slam him to the ground. He starts kicking in a boring my glasses go flying. I'm able to grab his wrist with my left hand, but he pulls his entire arm under his body. I'm no match for this guy as far as strength goes but I try to grab for his thumb so i can pull his arm behind his back, but he has his thumb tightly clenched in his fist. Fuck... I panic and don't even think of using a wrist lock. I pull with all my might on his wrist and start punching him in the bicep yelling \"Give me your arm now.... give me your fucking arm now\"\n\nFinally after what seems like hours he submits to hand restraints. I'm completely exhausted, another officer and I stand him up facing the wall outside of the cell. Around that time his cellmate is brought out of the cell. He looks terrified and like he just woke up.\n\nThe gargantuan skinhead starts crying to me about how he needs to pull his shorts up and sticks his hand in the back of his pants. I watch his hands closely and tell him to get them out of his pants. \"Fuck you bitch ass hoe bitch\" he retorts.  He pulls them out and keeps his first closed. A second later he makes a terrible whining sound and tries to head but my partner holding him. At the same time he throws a sock that was full of marijuana. We \"gingerly assist\" him to the ground and hold him there until he starts buking around. We assist him back to his feet, and I'm relieved by another officer to write use of force paperwork.\n\nWhen we were wrestling around on the ground the blood from the fight inside the cell was pooling from his broken nose. As I was walking down the stairs I realized my entire left sleeve and the part of the left side of my face were covered in his blood. All in all we recovered 1 cell phone and 1.5 ounces of marijuana. Said offender had 6 mounths left in the penitentiary, is now looking at to 30 more years for felony contraband and multiple counts of assault on a public servant. Long story short I love my job and I cant wait to get a job with a PD doing patrol.",

We start rolling over to the scene code 1, it was called in to non-emergency so we were taking our time. A few minutes later we're turning onto the street and we can see a woman standing on the curb next to some trash cans. \n\nNow this girl, she was in her early 20's, beach blonde hair, and was about 5'2. She was dressed in a tight red shirt that exposed her stomach, a black skirt that barely touched her thighs, and a single black high heel shoe.\n\nWe pull up and the officer opens his door. As soon as he pokes his head out the woman grabs the trash can next to her, launches it at the car and immediately takes off, attempting to run through the front yards of the residential area we were in. The officer is on her by the time she gets to the next house and grabs her arm. As soon as he grabs her, she spins around with her balled up fist and punches the officer right in the jaw. The officer immediately forces her to the ground, cuffs her and walks (her hobbling) back to the zone car.\n\nA few minutes later a female officer arrives, searches the woman, and she's placed in the car. As the officers are doing this the RP comes out and explains that the woman was dropped in the middle of the road by a black car and remained in the middle of the road screaming at anyone and anything in the area.\n\nWhen everything was said and done, she had scratched the paint on the new charger as well as broke the passenger side spotlight when she threw the garbage can and got hooked for disorderly conduct, assault on an officer, resisting arrest and damage to property. That's when I knew this career was for me.",

There were three total suspects, with two inside ransacking the home and one in the car, all of them were just regular comedians. \n\nWhen we snuck up on the driver, he was playing around with his phone and had a gun on his lap, partially concealed by his clothes. Fast forward to the end of the process when we're leaving lockup, and the driver was already being released for his concealed weapon charges. The dialogue was as follows:\n\nDriver: y'all got me messed up man. I was just playing Pokemon in my car chillin.\n\nMe: well you need to choose your friends better.\n\nDriver: I didn't know what they were doing, I was just playing Pokemon!\n\nMe: well just like in Pokemon, we gotta catch em all!\n\nIt was a pretty funny moment.

        "text": "Quick turn around on this one! Thanks for reading guys and gals - it blows my mind sometimes that something that started out as just 'getting a story written down' has turned into this. You guys are awesome and I appreciate all the kind words.\n\n\n_________________\n\n“You did what?” Things were getting awkward in the supervisor office as the Lt berated Sarge. \n\n“Well, I had the commander on the phone and he was at first worried about EMR. Then he started getting into squad stats and recommending enforcement operations and… you know how he can go on all day when he gets onto that topic! Next thing I know, he comes over with a signed summons!”\n\n“I get that, but Jesus! You couldn’t have talked to the City cop and request for her supervisor to respond when you first got there? You know one of us would have gone to the scene if one of them had crashed on our side.” Lt was cradling her head in her hands while I sat in the chair opposite. Sarge was leaning against the wall, arms crossed and defensive.\n\n“True, but how was I to know she’d write him? It was so clearly not his fault I just assumed we’d be good to go as soon as she wrote down their information!” Sarge’s voice cracked a little at the end.\n\nThe day had started off fairly normal – I woke at the ass crack of dawn to limp in to the station for a new tour, knowing full well the tidal wave of jokes that was awaiting me the moment I sat down in roll call. After getting dressed, I had a few minutes to hide in one of the cubicles with a computer to check my work email. That was the first odd moment: my normally boring inbox was filled with apologies and well-wishes from guys with City PD email addresses. Apparently City Cop’s antics had made it to the rank and file (and even some brass by the looks of some of the signatures) and they were none too happy about it, though some were more cordial than others:\n\n“Screw that bitch! I got your back if you need anything!”\n\n“Not saying you shouldn’t have signed but damn I would’ve liked to see the faces of the guys at the jail if she tried to drag you in!”\n\n“I am personally offended by the actions of my co-worker and offer my services if you need any assistance leading up to the court date.”\n\n“I promise her actions don’t represent any of the true feelings our agency has for yours.”\n\nI didn’t know how to respond to the outpouring of support so I just closed my email and shuffled to roll call. \n\n“Damn, EMR! You should hear the crap they’re giving the cop that wrote you the other day!” One of the guys on my squad who was a former City cop greeted me as I walked in. \n\n“Yeah?” Was all I could muster. I didn’t want to be the center of any more attention, let alone the cause for strife in anyone else’s life. \n\n“Now guys,” Sarge started as he sat down and shuffled the papers on the roll call board. “Let’s not get into a war with the City. EMR will have his day in court and everything will work itself out.” \n\nRoll call was surprisingly normal after that, although I did notice daggers coming from Lt’s eyes and shooting in Sarge’s direction throughout. After he read area assignments, Sarge dismissed us.\n\n“Oh, except you, EMR.” Lt added as I tried to make good my escape. “Come to our office when you’re done loading up.”\n\nAnd that was where I found myself, sitting in a chair while Lt reamed Sarge for his poor handling of my situation a few days prior. She kept shaking her head in disappointment and Sarge kept inspecting the ceiling for any new cracks that may have developed since the last time he checked. \n\n“Tell me you at least took pictures of the scene.” Lt asked through gritted teeth.\n\n“Well… I didn’t… no.” He was defeated and I felt sorrier for him than I had myself after signing the damn ticket. \n\n“And of course the idea of getting Accident Reconstruction out here was beyond you too, right?” Sarge just shook his head as Lt continued her barrage. It was like watching your parents argue only worse somehow. The urge to just take off running and be done with the whole ordeal was pulsing through me and I realized I was gripping the shoddy wooden arms of the poorly upholstered chair I had been designated to. \n\n“Fine, I’ll take care of it all from here on out.” Lt sighed and stood up. “EMR, meet me back at the scene after rush hour dies down. I’ll call in a favor with Accident Reconstruction and have them be there too. We’ll shut down the road for just a minute and take out measurements, if the damn skid marks are still there-” Sarge ducked his head a little further and recoiled like a struck puppy at the words Lt spat at him, “and hopefully things will be on our side.”\n\n“But you can’t stop traffic in the Ci-“\n\n“Shh!” Lt cut Sarge off mid-thought, pinching the air in front of his face. “See you there EMR.”\n\nI agreed to meet her and made my way to my cruiser. It was nice having such a bull dog on my side and I just hoped the Accident Reconstruction guys would find some evidence to validate my version of the wreck. \n\nThe morning dragged and I wondered when exactly the vague “when rush-hour dies” time was. I got the scene at what I assumed was still too early but found Lt and two guys in PD coveralls pacing the sidewalk with a measuring wheel. Lt waved me over. \n\n“EMR, Ernie. Ernie, EMR.” She introduced me to one of the reconstruction detectives. \n\n“Lt here saved my ass a couple times too, back in the day. Owe her a few favors, that’s for sure.” He told me as he shook my hand. “Good news - one hundred twenty feet of skid marks!”\n\n“Oh, cool.” I replied, acting like I understood why that was good news.\n\nLt piped up to educate me. “Ernie forgets not everyone has been through reconstruction school. Her car – not having anti-lock brakes and accounting for her first version to you – locked up back there” She pointed back up the road a good distance, “exiting the left lane and entering the right, and continued on through here. At this grade on this surface, one hundred twenty feet means she was cruising.”\n\n“At least fifty miles per hour. Speed limit is twenty five through here. At that speed, she gives up the right of way! I’ll have to firm up some math back at the office with apparent braking efficiency, drag factors, and such. That is, after I check out some things with your cruiser.” Ernie was all smiles. Clearly he got off on this type of thing. \n\n“Wow, thanks very much!” I still found the whole ordeal unsettling but somehow I felt a little lighter after hearing the evidence. \n\n“Ernie even volunteered to come in to testify and he’s going to make us up a nice poster of the wreck as the evidence shows – not the bullshit version from some money grubbing old lady who won the crappy cop lottery.” Lt patted Ernie on the back. \n\nAfter lingering a few minutes and serving no purpose other than the occasional approving nod in the direction of the guys doing the actual work, I thanked everyone profusely and went on with the routine of my everyday work day. The lingering stress of the event faded quickly with the reassurances from my bosses and co-workers, but was replaced a short time later by the stress of having to go to court and stand on the other side of the pulpit for a change. \n\nThe month between accident and trial flew by and my stomach was in knots the morning of the big day. Lt had volunteered to attend court with me and we had decided, based largely on our understanding of proceedings and excellent evidence provided by Ernie, to opt for me to represent myself. Worst case scenario, the Lt had assured me, I could always request a continuance if things started to get out of hand. \n\nWe arrived early to the court room to get a feel for the layout (the City uses a different court house than my department does) and see if there was a prosecutor around who may be up to dismissing the case even before it was called by the judge. I was no detective, at the time at least, but it was a good chance the woman sitting at the table piled up with paperwork and a line of uniformed cops leading up to her was our target. \n\nAfter a few minutes of waiting it was finally my turn to speak to her. “Hi, I’m officer EMR from County PD.”\n\n“We don’t have any cases with the County today.” She was too busy signing paperwork to spare me a passing glance. \n\n“Well, you do, kind of. You see, I was charged in a wreck while on duty and I was hop-“\n\n“Oh, you.” She turned to me now and raised a questioning brow at my enormous poster board accident diagram. “Well, I’ll have you know that case has provided me more than my share of headaches already. Every dumbass with a badge has been asking me if I’m going to toss it and at this point I think it would be best for all parties involved if it just went forward.”\n\n“Oh. Right.” I felt a little dejected as well as slightly intimidated that this was to be the person arguing against me.\n\n“You know, City policy is to charge every at fault party in a wreck, even cops.”\n\n“Didn’t know that.” I replied, trying to step out of line and find Lt again.\n\n“We toss the City tickets - doesn’t make sense to fine ourselves, right?” She had turned her seat fully, tracking me as I walked away. “We don’t have that problem with the County’s money though. Next!”\n\nLt was waiting with an eager expression back in the pews. “Well?”\n\n“She’s… rough.” I sighed. “She said we won’t be getting any breaks, just to let the judge call it.” I spared her some of the more infuriating aspects of the conversation for the sake of keeping things civil. \n\n“Well,” Lt started. “At least we’re prepared.”\n\nA few minutes later, City Cop entered and sat down in front of us, not even glancing in our direction. The judge came in not long after and called us to order. He was a sixty-something bald man, stern grimace his facial expression of choice, and after watching him overrule three motions for dismissal from actual attorneys, I wondered if that was the reason for the prosecutor’s earlier attitude – this guy was a machine.\n\n“Now on to the docket.” He began, in a nasally voice that cut through the silent courtroom. “I start with the officers with the least amount of cases, run through their dockets alphabetically, and will conduct trials as I see fit: during the docket, or after I’ve run through all the officers. That’s my call. Don’t go requesting any special treatment.” I looked over my poster once again, wishing Ernie had used a car other than one with bar lights to represent me in the crash.\n\n“First up, Officer City Cop, with an incredible showing of just one case!” The judge rolled his eyes as City Cop stood and sauntered over to the podium in the middle of the room, ignoring the jab. \n\n“Is Mr. EMR here?” I stood immediately and fumbled for my poster. I could hear my own heartbeat and my hands were suddenly clammy. \n\n“Here, sir!”\n\n“Now, just hold on, it looks like there was a subpoena issued for a witness. Mrs. Smith? Mrs. Emily Smith?” The courtroom was silent and more heads than mine were turning about, scanning for the other driver. It felt like an hour passed before the judge spoke again.\n\n“Well, it looks like the witness is a no-show. Sir, the state will dismiss your charge at this time without prejudice. The officer has the right to bring the charge back one time and you will be served at your place of residence by the police department where you live. Be awaiting that eventuality and have a good day. Officer Jones, you’re next. Two tickets! My, what a busy month you had.”\n\nI glanced to Lt whose eyes showed the same amount of shock as mine. She nodded towards the back of the courtroom and we hastily retreated, exiting into the atrium and freedom. \n\n“That wasn’t how I expected that to go.” She said, straightening her pants suit. \n\n“Right?” \n\nThe doors swung open behind us and City Cop exited the courtroom. We locked eyes and she started to smile, not with her whole face as in, ‘nice to see you!’ but only with her mouth as in a ‘I’m supposed to be cordial but really I wish you were dead’ kind of way.\n\n“Officer EMR! How are you? I won’t be bringing back the case, obviously.”\n\nObviously? As in I obviously wasn’t at fault in the first place? “Oh, thanks.” I said.\n\n“Yeah, no problem. I got a lot of crap for writing you. All these guys I work for were like, ‘You don’t write cops!’ blah, blah, blah…”\n\n“Yeah, I think I heard from a few of them.” \n\n“Oh? Well, they can all crawl back into their good ol’ boy holes now and let me get back to work.”\n\n“Yeah, hopefully we don’t have to deal with this at all anymore.” I added, trying to infer we no longer needed to be having the conversation even. \n\n“True. See you later.” She turned and slowly ambled away. \n\n“Not if we see you first.” Lt muttered under her breath. \n\nI found out what the prosecutor had said was true – the City does write their cops. Or, rather, supervisors in the City write their cops. They have an understanding with the prosecutor’s to dismiss those tickets like she said. City Cop had apparently been passed over for sergeant shortly before my crash. The reasoning, I found out from one of her squadmates a few days after court, was she was ‘lazy and wouldn’t react well to the added responsibility.’ She had used my crash as her platform to demonstrate she had no problem writing tickets to cops. She still didn’t end up getting promoted and was actually reprimanded for not following SOPs and calling a supervisor to the scene of my wreck on her own. \n\nAs for the wreck, the effects of my having been deemed at fault lingered for another year in civil court. The other driver claimed she had to go to the hospital shortly after we left. She attempted to sue the County for a couple million dollars but for some reason no-showed to those court dates as well. By the third one, I no longer had the courtroom butterflies.\n\nA couple years later I collared two guys for a horrific rape that occurred in the City (I could write that story too!) and had to attend court there as a witness. After a witness rule was put into effect, I sat out in the atrium and waited my turn. I glanced over and noticed a familiar face.\n\n“You here for the rape?” City Cop asked, sitting down in the bench right next to me. \n\n“Yeah.” I replied, not knowing the proper protocol for that uncomfortable situation. \n\n“Me too. I worked the crime scene.” She leaned back in the bench and kicked her feet out in front of her. “Crime scene is tough, but someone’s got to do it, you know?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“First time here in our court house?” She asked.\n\n“Uh…” I couldn’t believe she didn’t remember me. “Well, I’ve been here once before.”\n\n“For another trial?”\n\n“Yeah. Kind of. It was dismissed.” The words came on their own now, leading me down the path to supreme awkwardness.\n\n“What was the case?”\n\n“A crash. Happened while I was working.”\n\n“As a cop? Here in the City?” Suspicion was starting to gather on her brow.\n\n“Yeah, in my cruiser. I was with County though. I was written a ticket.”\n\nThere were a few beats of silence during which City Cop pondered the floor. “Well! Good luck with your testimony! I’ve got to use the little girl’s room!” \n\nI’ve never seen her again.\n",

        "text": "“Sir: my name is Officer Nick and the reason I pulled you over is because I was attempting to pass through the intersection and you failed to yield on making your right turn on red causing me to slam my brakes to avoid striking your vehicle.” Nick let it all out in one breath, robotic and emotionless. He straightened up from his half bend and stepped back into the bladed stance taught in the academy before looking up to me for approval. Nick had only been out of his field training period for a couple shifts and I was trying my best to not only overwrite some of the stick stuck up his ass from that whole process, but also some of the more deeply embedded stick from his time in the Marines. He was good at following protocol, that was for sure. \n\nWe walked back to his car after getting the driver’s license and registration and I leaned into his cruisers passenger window. \n\n“Good job with the cadence back there Mr. Roboto.”\n\n“What? That’s how we’re taught.” He didn’t look up from the summons he was filling out, pen grasped Neanderthal style in his meaty fist. \n\n“I know, but you’ll find things generally go easier for you if people can relate to you as another human being. Maybe smile, crack a joke. And you also know you don’t have to write a ticket for every infraction you see.” I had noticed he was filling in the codes for no seatbelt and the cracked windshield on the offending car. \n\n“If I don’t write him, he’ll never learn.” \n\n“You don’t think adding fifteen minutes onto his commute this morning isn’t lesson enough. I would’ve scratched him a warning for the right on red, passed him my card, and told him to give me a call if he sees any real crime going down.”\n\nNick looked up at me with an incredulous glare. “Yeah, the fifty something accountant-looking guy is going to have some good leads to offer up on meth dealers. Sure.” He scoffed and returned to his writing. \n\n“Well, never gonna catch a fish if you never cast any lines, that’s all I’m saying.” \n\n“More like, ‘never gonna catch a fish if you’re fishing in the water cooler outside your accouting office cubicle.’ He’s driving a new car: he’ll prepay, fix the windshield, and maybe I’m saving his life by reminding him to wear his seatbelt.”\n\n“Whatever. If you want to be the pocket filler for The Man, have at it. That’s not my bag.” I stood and followed Nick back to the car. As we approached, the dispatcher was sending Jim to a call in my area. Apparently, a contractor had shown up to hire some day laborers from a local Home Depot. The reason he was calling the police, however, was that his failure to pay the last group he had hired wasn’t sitting well and now the whole troop was surrounding his van and cursing at him. The call had somehow been entered as a low level “Civil Complaint” but I knew the makings of a potential stabbing when I heard them. \n\n“Nick – I’m going to roll to that call in my area.” Nick waved a dismissive hand, opting to continue arguing with the driver over signing his summons.\n\nI jogged back to my cruiser and pulled into traffic, turning off my overheads and making my way to the left lane of the busy four lane divided road. I stopped at the gap in traffic and the driver in the opposing left lane waved me through. I had worked the “Good Samaritan” accident enough to not go immediately, and instead crept around his car so I could make sure the right lane was vacant before finishing my U-Turn. There was no car and I committed. I made it about 90% around and into the right lane when I heard an odd screeching sound and felt the impact, BAM!!, from behind. After a moment of confusion, I realized I had been run into and threw my lights on. \n\nI ran to the driver of the car that had hit me. “Are you OK?” Her airbags had gone off and the acrid smoke was settling still but she nodded she was fine. “I can call you an ambulance if you want.”\n\n“No, no. I’m fine. Sorry I hit you. I’m just so late. I changed lanes and didn’t see you until the last minute. I tried to stop but I skid into you.”\n\n“I’m not hurt, you’re not hurt, cars can be fixed. Just sit tight and I’ll start working on things.” I left her car and scanned around to get my bearings. I knew I was close to the border of mine and a neighboring jurisdiction and a quick glance at the street signed confirmed it: I was in enemy territory. \n\nCrap. \n\nI changed my radio over to the neighboring agency’s channel. “County 4xray55 on City channel one.”\n\n“County 4xray55, go ahead.”\n\n“County 4xray55, I’ve been involved in an accident in your jurisdiction, corner of Oak and Main. If you could, start one unit my way for report please. No injuries but we’ll need tow.”\n\n“10-4, 1020bravo, can you start that way?”\n\nI then pulled out my cell phone and called the station. The desk operator answered on the second ring. “Is this EMR? Ha! I just heard you on City’s channel. You get crashed into?”\n\nI sighed. “Yeah. Great morning so far.” \n\n“I suppose you want sarge?”\n\n“Yes please, or LT, if she’s in - either way.”\n\nThe phone beeped, indicating I was on hold and I noticed the driver of the other car slowly extricating herself from the wreckage of her vehicle and entering the travel lane.\n\n“Ma’am. You should probably get up on the sidewalk - don’t want you getting involved in another accident this morning.” She nodded in thanks and walked to the corner, massaging her neck and surveying the damage on her car.\n\n“Sergeant Thompson!” He was chipper this morning.\n\n“Hey boss, it’s EMR. Look, I got run into up here at Oak and Main, just over the line in the City. They’re on the way but I knew you’d want to be notified too.”\n\n“Oh, wow. You ok? I’ll head you way. Is city sending a supervisor?”\n\n“Sounded like just a street unit.”\n\n“Ok, we’ll deal with that later. I’m coming!” He hung up and I was left in the awkward company of the woman who had just thrown a wrench into my morning routine. \n\n“You sure you’re ok?” I asked again, noticing she was still massaging her neck.\n\n“Well, I didn’t realize at first you were driving a police car.” She answered, oddly. \n\n“Well, if you haven’t noticed, I’m wearing the uniform too.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I see that now. My glasses flew off in the crash. Why’d you turn in front of me?”\n\nI tilted my head back and let my jaw hang as I examined the clouds. I saw where this was going.\n\n“Tell you what: let’s fill out some exchange forms while we wait!” It would keep her occupied and keep me from wanting to scream. I sat in my cruiser after giving her a sheet and pen and waited for City. \n\nA few moments later, the City cruiser pulled up. Now, a thing that needs to be said about the relationship between my agency and City is my agency is considered to be the big kids on the block. All my buddies that work for surrounding agencies never want to hear my complaints about unfair policy and lack of raises because I “can’t talk seeing as my department has all the money.” There are several chips on shoulders but generally we get along while working the job.\n\nThe female City officer sauntered up to the driver of the other car and started talking to her. I approached and was greeted with a raised finger indicating I would be tended to in a minute. Really?\n\n“He just came out of nowhere! I was driving along and next thing I know there’s a car in front of me. Oh, Lord! My neck is tightening up!”\n\n“You want an ambulance?” City Cop asked.\n\n“No, no, thank you for asking though. I’ll be fine after a few Tylenol. I think I’ll have to call in sick to work today though.” She grimaced and massaged her neck again. \n\nCity Cop turned to me. “So. What happened?”\n\n“Well, I was going to make a U-Turn to go back into the county and back up my buddy. There was a break in traffic for the intersection and I knew better than to trust the guy who was stopped and waved me on so I crept up, made sure the lane was clear, and then started my turn. As you can see by the damage, she hit me in the rear so I didn’t pull in front of her. She made a spontaneous utterance immediately after the wreck saying she was in a rush and how she had just switched lanes. I never saw her.”\n\nCity Cop nodded, then stuck out her open hand. “License?”\n\n“Oh, sure thing.” I fumbled for my wallet and found my license. \n\n“Go dig up the registration on your car. I’ll be back in a few.” She asked the other driver again if she was fine then returned to her cruiser.\n\nAfter a few more minutes waiting Sarge pulled up and hopped out of his car. His cell phone was plastered to his ear. “Yeah, I know I need a report. I’m…” He pulled the phone away and mouthed the words ‘the commander’ while pointing to the phone, “I’m just pulling up. I’ll call you back in a minute.” He hung up and asked how I was.\n\n“Fine, thanks. I think the story here is quickly mutating into a potential money grab though. The other driver is putting a little spin on things.” I nodded in the direction of the other driver, her massage and grimace intensifying when she caught Sarge’s gaze.\n\n“Well, we’ll work on that when we get to it. What happened here?” I walked him through the accident as I saw it and in the end he was nodding along. “Well, judging by the hundred feet or so of skid marks, I’d guess she was at least doing double the speed limit. At least you won’t be held at fault!” He pat my back and pulled out his phone again as he walked back to his cruiser. \n\nI felt better now that I knew I had someone on my side and returned to my car to fish around for the registration. I finally found it and walked it back to the City cruiser, finding the other driver had already taken a seat in the back seat. She was chatting with the City Cop who was filling out paperwork on a clipboard in the driver’s seat. \n\n“Here ya’ go!” I said as I offered up the registration. \n\nCity Cop started a bit from my sudden chipperness but received the registration nonetheless. “Just finishing up some paperwork; hop in if you want.” She cleared her cooler off the passenger seat and I got in. After a few minutes she began her soliloquy. \n\n“Now, as both of you know, my job here is to determine fault in the accident. I have to write the report that will be sent to the insurance companies and it may take them some time to decide who pays what.” I nodded along with her speech and glanced back at the other driver who was doing the same. \n\n“So, that being said, we’re lucky here because the County self-insures!” I nodded for a moment, and then stopped. \n\n“Wait, b-” I started but was cut off. \n\n“So, officer, EMR,” She passed her clipboard to me, “If you don’t mind: press hard, four copies.” \nI glanced over the document. Sure enough, she had written me a ticket for fail to yield the right of way. My full name, home address, birth date, driver’s license number – all there in black and white. She had even written in ‘police Crown Victoria’ in the ‘vehicle model’ block.\n\n“Yeah, hold on one second.” I passed the clipboard back and exited the cruiser hastily. I sprinted to Sarge’s car and knocked on his window. \n\nHe was still talking to the commander and seemed a little miffed at my intrusion. “What?” He whispered while covering the receiver with his hand while keeping the speaker to his ear.\n\n“She wrote me a ticket.” \n\n“Wh-what?!” His whisper got a little louder. “How? Why??” \n\nI shrugged. \n\n“Hold on, I’ve got to talk to- Yes sir, still here. Yes. He’s not injured, I’ve double checked.” He then rolled up his window. And held up a finger indicating he’d be right with me. \n\nI turned to find City Cop standing behind me, clipboard in hand. \n\n“You know the routine – sign this or else I have to take you in.” She passed the board in my direction with a contemptuous smirk.\n\n“You really think I’m at fault? Look at the skid marks!” I motioned to the streak of black on the asphalt. \n\n“Tho-those were there before. I drive this route every day!” The other driver piped up, suddenly spry and miraculously no longer feeling the effects of the crash on her neck.\n\n“I heard your tires screeching!” I was incensed. \n\n“Hey, hey. I’m not an accident reconstructor,” City Cop started, “I’m just the eyes and ears for the insurance companies, y’know? What we have here is a pretty clear case of fail to yield. Press hard – four copies!”\n\nI looked to Sarge for guidance but he was still meekly talking into his cell phone. With reluctance, I took the chrome Ball pen from my uniform pocket and signed my name in the appropriate location. \n\n“Thank you.” City cop ripped off my carbon copy, then ripped off another and passed it to the other driver. “And this copy will serve as your subpoena! This isn’t how it’s usually done, but this isn’t a typical accident, is it?”\n\nI stumbled back to Sarge’s cruiser, examining the neon ticket copy I was holding. I looked over it and at him through his still rolled-up window which he lowered when he realized what had happened. “He… he signed.” He said into the phone. \n\nThe fanfare that greeted me at the station as I hopped out of the wrecker that ferried my destroyed cruiser into the secured lot was on par with the arrival of the Beetles in America. Word spread quickly of the incident and most everyone took the opportunity to throw jabs in my direction. \n\n“Guess you need a little more EVOC, eh EMR?” Laughter all around.\n\n“You gonna pre-pay that? City court is a bitch!” Guffaws.\n\n“Foot patrol isn’t so bad!” Snorts and knee slapping.\n\nI took it all in stride and began emptying the contents from the cruiser. “Did you keep the ticket or did Sarge take it?”\n\n“No, I’ve got it, right here.” I held it up and heard the distinctive whir of a Polaroid camera capturing the moment for posterity. Great. I still had a few more hours left in the shift and I was sure I’d come back to find Xeroxed copies of the picture taped all over the station – standard fare, really. \n\nInstead, several hours late when my shift was done, I was called into the roll call room where the senior squad member was waiting with his speech for the rest of the squad.\n\n“Well, EMR, you learned a valuable lesson today: even cops get tickets.” It wasn’t the catchiest of phrases but you would have thought differently judging by the uproar. The laughter intensified when I was gifted a plaque, my picture holding the ticket emblazoned upon it with my newly appointed catch phrase underneath. \n\n“Thanks guys, I’m honored.”\n\nI later learned I was only the second cop in the history of the department to receive a ticket on duty – the first having occurred some thirty years earlier during a feud with State Police. The honor remains to this day, eleven years later, as still there are no more additions to my elite club.\n",

With that my friend was given a letter of appreciation, and an award for ticketing the chief of police...by the chief himself.\n\nHe's relatively new this city and was worried how the chief was going react.

        "text": "Mid day I am out on patrol and hear the buzz of the priority tone.\n\n*Person screaming from inside 120 A street, called in by neighbor, someone yelling \"help me please.\"*\n\nI am about three blocks away so I start running code in that direction, showing up less than a minute later.  When I pull onto the block there are several neighbors out in front of 120 A Street and a woman standing in the doorway of 120 A Street.  \n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked\n\n*Nothing...?* The neighbors said confused\n\n\"Did you guys call? Is there someone screaming?\"\n\n*No one screaming, we didn't call ya'll.*\n\n\"Ma'am, did you call?\" Asking the woman in the door way\n\n*Nope, everything good here.* She responded.\n\nI look around as another officer pulls up on the block, I walk over to him and tell him there's nothing out here, no one called.  \n\nAs we are talking, maybe a minute later, a woman comes storming down the street, screaming at the top of her lungs.\n\n\"Why the fuck are you here? I didn't call you, I called for an ambulance, what the fuck are you doing here? I didn't call you!\"\n\nThe other officer and myself look at each other confused...\n\n*Ma'am, what is going on?*\n\n\"I didn't call you, why are here?\"\n\nShe goes fast walking by and walks into 110 A Street and the yelling continues inside.\n\nThe other officer and I walk into the house and there is an older woman with blood on her face.\n\n\"Why are you here? Leave! I don't want you here, you can't do anything for her, get out!\"\n\n*What is the issue with her? Why does she have blood on her face?*\n\nAt this point she starts going full 5yr old tantrum, \"get out get out get out!!!!!!\"\n\n*Stop yelling and answer the question, what happened with her.*\n\nShe fast walks out of the home.  An older man with a baby in his arms walks downstairs and says that the older woman \"had a stroke or seizure or something.\"\n\nThe other officer goes outside and asks dispatch to start an ambulance over this way to transport this woman to a hospital.\n\n*Sir, we have an ambulance coming right now, who is the younger woman that was yelling?*\n\n\"That's her daughter, she's upset because she called 911 for an ambulance.\"\n\n*Was she yelling like that over the phone?*\n\n\"Yeah, she's got a temper.\"\n\n*Well that's why we are here then, because dispatch didn't understand what she wanted.*\n\n\"Makes sense...\"\n\nThe older woman is awake but can't speak, it appeared as though she was suffering from partial facial numbness.\n\n*Ma'am, please do not try to move or speak, just relax we have an ambulance coming for you.  Sir, please watch her and if she appears to be in pain please get my attention, I will be outside waiting for the ambulance.*\n\nI walk outside and the other officer is there getting yelled at by the younger woman.\n\n\"WHY ARE YOU HERE??? I WANT YOU TO LEAVE, I DIDN'T CALL YOU.\"\n\nThe other officer just looks at her with a blank expression.\n\nI walk over and say, *Ma'am, we are here now so we are going to figure this out, we have an ambulance coming, you can wait for them inside instead of causing a scene outside.*\n\n\"I WILL DO WHAT I WANT!\" And she walks inside.\n\nI hear the ambulance sirens getting closer, the station isn't too far away.\n\nThey show up and I wave them over to the right house.  As soon as they walk inside the woman starts yelling at them, \"help her! why are you taking so long???\" and so forth.  We walk in and tell her to go into the kitchen and give the EMT's room to work, she did.\n\nThe EMT's loaded the older woman up and left the home and went on to the hospital.  I got all the information I needed from the older man with the baby.  \n\nWhen we went to get back into our vehicles the younger woman started yelling again, \"Go do your jobs, you didn't do anything here, go away, we don't want you here.\"  \n\n*Have a good day ma'am.* \n\n...and we drove away.\n\nMoral of the story?  Yelling won't get your point across.  Ever.\n\n",

        "text": "*Not me...not even my story, it happened to my old partner, but I love it like it was my own.*\n\nOur department has the academy, field training, and then you do two months of \"little T\" where you ride with senior officers in your sector. The difference between that and field training being that there is no grading, and no real fear of losing your job, it's mainly to get you out of \"I'm riding with a trainer\" mode and into \"I'm working with a partner\" mode. \n\nAnyway, this officer, let's call him Jay, was on little T. I had taken the day off, so my partner was riding solo. They stuck Jay with my partner. During field training Jay had done some goofy stuff, like submarining a squad car into a 3 foot deep hole/puddle when there was ample concrete parking on either side of said puddle. So, he already had a reputation for being an idiot. Most people who got him on little T would have just slowed down, answered a few BS calls (suspicious persons, loud musics, random gunshots, etc) and gone home. My partner only had one speed and loved to chase dope, so he was going to chase dope no matter who was in the car with him.\n\nSo he's rolling down a street, past a known drug house. He slows as he passes and sees that the front door is wide open and a guy is sitting on a couch facing the door (pretty common in our drug houses in the summer because most of them lack AC and it's 100+ degrees.) He rolls past the house, and he and Jay get out. As he's walking up he realizes that the guy is cutting and packing cocaine on the table right in front of the couch, right where the police, god, and everyone else can see. The guy finally sees them coming and gets up, runs to the door, and slams it closed. My partner tells Jay to run around to the back of the house and make sure no one runs out. My partner then asks for additional cover elements (he wasn't going to kick the door and go in alone after all) and starts banging on the door. \n\nAfter a few minutes, right as the cover is getting there, someone opens the door. It's a lady. My partner pulls her out of the house and she's detained. Past her he can see that the guy and the cocaine are no longer conveniently sitting in plain view. He and his cover go in and pull out two more people, neither of which are the guy who had been sitting on the couch when they got there.\n\nThey tear the house up. They search the attic. And again, it's over 100 degrees so they're sweating their asses off. They go outside and talk to the three people who they found. None of them will admit that there was a 4th guy in there who had vanished with the cocaine. About that time, Jay comes casually walking around the front of the house and asks what's going on. My partner, who truly believes he is going insane, says something like \"We can't find the guy with the cocaine. You saw him too right? I'm not making this up.\" To which Jay replies \"Oh, he ran out the back of the house a long time ago.\"\n\nJay story #2:\n\nThat same night, my partner is driving Jay around, still fuming about the guy he had watched run away. He looks over at Jay and notices that there is blood running down Jay's cheek. He pulls the car over and says \"Shit you're bleeding.\"\n\nJay says, \"Yeah, I got my earpiece stuck.\" \n\nThere are two things that amuse me about that: 1) I have the same radio earpiece as Jay. After I heard this story, I actually tried to get my earpiece stuck in my ear and found it to be almost impossible. 2) \"I got my earpiece stuck\" is not an explanation for why you're bleeding.\n\nSo of course my partner asked him again why he was bleeing. Jay revealed that once he got his earpiece stuck and couldn't get it out with his fingers, he decided the most efficient tool would be his pocket knife.\n\nMy partner had to take him to a fire station so they could pull it out with tweezers and bandage his ear.\n\nJay ended up getting fired after a few more mishaps. The last straw was he showed up at the range for pistol qualifications drunk. They gave him a PBT at the range and he blew 0.15. When he got to the clinic for an official test, he blew a 0.18. The Traffic/DWI cop that did all of the testing said that meant he was probably still drinking while he was on his way to the range.\n",

        "text": "Around the tail end of the spring in 2014, I began the process of discharging from the United States Army after serving since 2011. My ambitions post-transition were to become a sworn full time law enforcement officer in the state of Tennessee. I had the pleasure of meeting a Recruiting Sergeant from a local PD at a career fair sponsored by the U.S. Army and we hit it off. 2 months later, I was offered an internship that I took while transitioning out of the military. It was a great experience, and it took me on roughly 10 ride-alongs with the same FTO who confirmed my ambitions about becoming a law enforcement officer.\n\n\nI asked and was allowed to ride with FTO A* for a 3rd shift patrol (1800-0600) on Halloween night. I enjoyed riding with FTO A because he was also prior service military, serving 10 years as a Military Policeman before medically discharging to become a Police Officer. He treated me like an adult and allowed some lee-way once he was confident that I was not a reckless individual. I would step out on traffic stops, step out on unruly juvenile calls, etc. I had made fairly decent friends with most of the Patrolman on the 3rd shift roster, and I felt very comfortable around them. I have since moved from Tennessee so sadly, I was not able to be employed by the Department. \n\n\nFTO A had noted that his wife had split their candy supply down the middle and rationed him off half so that we could hit the local neighborhoods and chat with some of the trick or treaters, but our night started off with an immediate Code 3 cover within seconds of us calling 10-8. Officer B* had recently announced a traffic stop on a silver Honda Accord traveling west bound after he observed the vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. When he stepped out on the vehicle to make his initial approach, he observed a red, late model (2000 - 2004) Chevrolet Silverado full size pick up truck brandish a firearm out the window, at a passing motorist, then speed off. It was believed by Officer B that the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado did not observe Officer B, as his front light bar lights were off, and his forward facing take-down lights were only illuminated at the silver Honda Accord.\n\n\nOfficer B retreated to his vehicle after releasing the Honda Accord and sped off in an attempt to intercept the Chevrolet Silverado, he had announced on the radio that he would need units going enroute Code 3 and a TAC channel, as he'd be conducting a felony stop on the Silverado if the intercept was successful. \n\n\nFTO A and I called our cover and began our commute to Officer B's location, but upon arrival, Officer B announced over the air that the vehicle was lost, and issued a BOLO via Teletype. We did not see the Chevrolet Silverado for the remainder of our shift.\n\n\nGoing 10-8 from our location, Officer B proceeded back to his zone and FTO A and I proceeded north to the interstate, as it was the quickest, most direct route back to our zone. Upon entering the on-ramp onto the highway, FTO A noted to me that the driver (newer model Ford Explorer, white) in front of us was having a difficult time maintaining a lane. After transitioning onto the interstate and continuing for roughly a mile, FTO A noted that his suspicion was unfounded and that the driver was most likely driving distracted. FTO A and I exited the interstate and transitioned back into our zone and continued our patrol. \n\n\nRoughly 15 minutes after re-entering our zone, FTO A and I were called to an unruly juvenile at a foster home and began our commute to the location. FTO A noted that he was familiar with this foster home in particular, and expressed his lack of trust for the employees working at the foster home. We arrived at the address around 10 minutes later, and stepped out to make contact.\n\n\nUpon entering the residence I noted the smell of feces and possibly urine, as well as significant property damage done inside the residence (broken book shelves, broken chair, two visible holes in an exterior wall, a yellow liquid on the kitchen floor that was later determined to be urine). The on-shift employee at the foster home informed FTO A and I that a 10 year old juvenile whose guardianship is maintained by the foster home became enraged when the on-shift employee refused to allow the foster home to go trick or treating. While most of the other juveniles simply accepted this decision, the one 10 year old juvenile in particular began arguing with the on-shift employee and eventually began stomping his foot and yelling. The on-shift employee informed FTO A and I that once he told the 10 year old juvenile that his decision was final, the juvenile began enraged and began throwing books, pushed a book shelf over on top of a chair, punched a wall several times, and in the process of this rage had soiled himself as well as urinated on the kitchen floor. FTO A took a report from the on-shift employee, and the on-shift employee noted that he would like FTO A to take the juvenile into custody on an \"unruly juvenile\" charge. FTO A informed the juvenile to place his hands behind his back, and handcuffed him, before searching him and informing him that he was going to be placed in our custody under an \"unruly juvenile\" charge. The 10 year old juvenile was transported from the foster home, to the local jail where he was seen by a Court Magistrate, and placed in a juvenile holding cell pending an arrival of Child Protective Services.\n\n\nReleased from the Court Magistrate, FTO A and I announced our 10-8 and commuted roughly 10 minutes back into our zone before pulling into a local parking lot. FTO A shorthanded some notes that I inputted into the MDT and we submitted the report to the Patrol Sergeant after a careful review by FTO A. At that point, it was roughly 2030 hours and FTO A began coordinating with another officer, Officer C* about passing out candy in the local neighborhoods. \n\n\nFTO A and I departed the parking lot and proceeded south, into a small neighborhood where we began to pull alongside trick or treaters and converse casually with them and their parents. Candy was passed out, and the process repeated itself up and down the block. Roughly 10 minutes into a conversation that FTO A was having with a parent, I observed a beige, late model Buick Century with no operating head lights, driving slowly down the street in my side-view mirror. I alerted FTO A about the suspicious vehicle, and he leaned over my seat and sternly said out of the window as the Buick passed us: \"Turn your lights on.\"\n\n\nThe driver of the vehicle quickly turned his head to the side and seemed shocked by the presence of a police officer, and immediately stated: \"I'm sorry!\" in a very anxious tone. FTO A and I both observed that the driver of the vehicle was acting suspicious, and pulled out behind him and initiated a traffic stop. FTO A and I exited the vehicle, while FTO A approached the driver side of the Buick and I maintained an observation from the rear, passenger side door. FTO A and the driver conversed for roughly 3 minutes before he returned to the unit with the driver's information. FTO A noted that the driver did not emit any odor of alcohol which he found strange, but that the driver was very anxious and his hands were visibly shaking. \n\n\nFTO A began relaying to Control and Wants &amp;amp;amp;amp; Warrants, with the dispatcher returning a highlight announcing that the individual we had pulled over was indeed a registered sex offender, with past charges including aggravated sexual abuse of a child and that he lived in a city roughly 40 miles away from our city. FTO A informed Control that he would need another unit to our location for cover, and we waited inside our unit for Officer C to arrive.\n\n\nUpon Officer C's arrival, FTO A and Officer C approached the vehicle and told the driver to step out. They immediately detained him and brought him to the front of our vehicle for questioning. Control came back with another highlight for the driver, alerting FTO A and Officer C that the sex offender had been put on a curfew for Halloween night by his parole agent, and that he was not supposed to be out past 1900 hours. I wrote down the pertinent information, including the specifics of his sex offender registry, and passed them off to FTO A so he could cross check them during his on-scene questioning.\n\n\nWhen asked why he was out, in a residential neighborhood, in a city nowhere near his residence, on Halloween night, as a sex offender, the driver of the vehicle informed FTO A that he was simply out to \"clear his head\". FTO A seemed disgusted, and asked Officer C to watch on him while he conducted a brief vehicle search. \n\n\nThe search of the vehicle revealed several bags of candy, as well as an assisted open knife, and a pack of condoms. A small bag of marijuana (2-3 grams) was also found as FTO A was concluding his search. When confronted by FTO A with the fact that the sex offender was driving around in a neighborhood, nowhere near his residence, on Halloween night, as a sex offender, with a pack of condoms, a knife, candy, and marijuana, the sex offender shut down completely and refused to cooperate from that point. He was placed under arrest for violation of a sex offender registry, simple possession of marijuana, and other charges I'm sure that I'm not aware of. He was transported by Officer C to the local Sheriff's detention center.\n\n\nTried to write it almost like a report, so it probably seems a bit black &amp;amp;amp;amp; white. Was definitely one of the more interesting but screwed up things I've been out on. Was very rewarding knowing that he didn't get a chance to do anything terrible to those children.\n\n\n\n\n* Personally Identifiable Information (PII) given in this recollection is completely fictional, in the effort to preserve privacy and personnel security (PERSEC).\n\n",

When I was driving home from work this past Tuesday I noticed that I was starting to have trouble breathing. I pulled off the highway to a road that led to a neighborhood when I noticed someone was following me. A local police officer. I took my inhaler out of my pocket and began to breathe deeply.\n\nI put the car into park and exhaled. He put on his overhead lights and I turned on my dome light. While my deep breathing continued the officer had stepped out and approached my vehicle. When he got to my car I knew who he was.

        "text": "This is the story of how I became known as *The Terror Bomber* and *Lt. Lunchbox* at work.\n\nI used to work in a shipping warehouse in [Shit City in Canada] shipping wooden mouldings and doors. I would bus to work, but because my city's transit system is a pile of garbage, I was stuck with a 40 minute wait at the Tim Hortons across the street from the warehouse before my shift started every day.\n\nSo I sit there, eat my donut and drink my coffee, go to work, all good. At break I think, \"Hmm... Maybe I'll eat my apple to tide me over til lunch.\" Go to my locker and realize my lunch isn't there. \"Ah crap. Left it at Tim's. Oh well, no time to get it now, I'll grab it at lunch.\"\n\nFast forward 45 minutes. I'm loading up a crate of aspen stair rails and I over hear my boss go \"... Blah blah cops at Timmie's!\" Me, not getting it at this point, but being a nosy little shit go \"What's that? Cops at Tim's?\"\n\nShe turns to me and says, \"Yeah, a whole bunch! Something about a strange package.\"\n\n*Click*\n\n\"Ummm I think that might be my lunch box.\"\n\nHere is where a small detail becomes important. My lunch box is an old army ammo canister that I found at a surplus store. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.\n\nSo I jog over to the coffee joint and sure enough. 5 Vics all parked out front. I walk up to the nearest officer and say, \"I heard that there was a strange box in there or something?\"\n\n\"Yup\"\n\n\"I think it's my lunch box.\"\n\n\"Come again?\"\n\n\"It's my lunch box.\"\n\n\"Could you describe it for me?\" Second officer walks up beside him because his interest is piqued.\n\n\"Well it's an ammo canister. About 10\" by 6\" by 3\". Green, got a listing of the amounts of munitions it can hold on the side.\"\n\n\"What's in it?\"\n\n\"... My... Lunch...\"\n\nHe says very sternly, \"What... Is in it?\"\n\n\"Ummm... Two sandwiches, three juice boxes, an apple, few granola bars.\"\n\n\"Come with us.\"\n\nHe takes me to one of the squad cars where his buddy is looking at some kid reading the paper, eating a donut, and drinking coffee on his screen. The first officer says, \"Is that you?\"\n\n\"Yep. My jacket is back at work, but that's me.\"\n\nAt this point the first cop seems annoyed, but the second one is smiling. He asks, \"So why are you using a munitions canister as a lunch kit?\"\n\nI said, \"Because it's cool and it was only 10 bucks.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Follow us.\"\n\nWe go into the restaurant. They have the table I was at sectioned off with chairs from other tables (Lol. Good luck with that if it was a bomb). The first cop says, \"That it?\"\n\nI see my Lunchbomb there on the ground and say \"Yup.\"\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\nI walk over and pry it open and show them my food for the day. They're satisfied enough to \"Call off the bomb squad.\" (Crapped my pants at that)\n\nThe second cop starts laughing. He informs me that often times munitions canisters are used in actual bombs. The first cop says, \"Get a different lunch box.\"\n\nI apologized to the staff of the establishment who break out into applause as I walk up to them. They assured me that they were fine to stand outside and smoke for an hour and get paid for it.\n\nAnd that's how I never lived down being the lunch box bomber.",

        "text": "While I went to the academy, ride alongs with different agencies were required.  I decided to have fun and ride along on a Friday night afternoon shift - which happened to be the night before St. Patrick's Day.  In a college town.  Many interesting things happened.  But this story stands out.   \nWe get an attempted break-in in progress call.  Complainant states that a bloody person keeps banging on her door and yelling.  Both my officer and I initially thought that dispatch went all British in using \"bloody\" (dispatch around here tends to get sarcastic at times).  We were wrong.    \n\n\nThe location of the call was a popular apartment complex for college kids.  Mostly rich frat or sorority students (or, at least, rich parents).  The exterior looked something like [this](http://kotv.images.worldnow.com/images/20538195_SA.jpg) (And no, that isn't a picture of us at the call).    \n\n\nWe finally arrive at the location and walk up the stairs.  The officer is ahead of me.  As I'm following him, I hear \"HOLY SHIT! DISPATCH GET EMS OUT HERE NOW!\"  At this point, I'm thinking \"dead body?\"  When I finally get eye level, I immediately want to jump back down the stairs.    \n\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the blood.  It was everywhere.  Like Alford Hitchcock levels.  I notice one of the apartment doors covered in it.  And a man simply sitting on the stairs to the third floor with blood pouring off of his hand.    \n\n\nAs a side note, when you get drunk...like college level St. Patties day style drunk, your blood tends to thin.  A lot.  So when you cut your hand on a glass bottle, like this upstanding citizen happened to do, you tend to get it everywhere.    \n\n\nFunny thing?  The guy didn't even know he was bleeding.  When the officer told him, he looked at his hand and said something along the lines of \"Huh.  Okay.\"    \n\n\nEMS arrived pretty quickly.  Or at least I didn't keep track of the time.  As EMS was treating the bleeding drunk, we went to check on the complainant behind the very bloody door.    \n\n\nI see the officer about to knock, hesitate, put on gloves, then knock.  A bawling, twenty-something (attractive, I'll admit) college student answered and just about hugged the officer before she saw true extent of the blood.  She proceeded to retreat back into her apartment.  I, in my polo and academy-issued cargo pants just smiled awkwardly at the poor girl.  At this point, about 3 (somewhat sober) people came up and started profusely apologizing to the girl.  We finally get the full story.     \n\n\nOur suspect had a bit too much fun at the bar across the street and decided to find his ex-girlfriend to try to hook up with again.  In the process, he broke the beer bottle he brought with him and cut himself on it. Turns out, in his drunken stupor, he was a building over from where his ex lived.  He was also a stubborn asshole and wouldn't take anyone at their word that she didn't live there.    \n\n\nEMS wrapped him up, we picked out the friend that was sober, and told them to drive him home.   The rest of the friends got ammonia and bleach and tried to clean up the blood the best they could.  They were pretty cool people, now that I think of it.    \n\n\n*Oh...but it's not over.*   \n\n\nAbout three hours later, we get a trespass call (location was about 2-3 miles from the apartment complex).  Another girl let her friend in, but asked him to leave when he stained her carpet with blood.  He then refused to leave, ripped off a bandage, and is currently staining the carpet even more.    \n\n\nWe both look at each other and sigh.  \"Bloody hell,\" I retort sarcastically.  The officer chuckled a bit. \nWhen we arrive at the call, the suspect already left.  We let another officer take the complainant's information as we go look for our guy.  We find him walking down the street (or, at least, stumbling).  The officer parks up ahead and we get out and walk towards the suspect.    \n\n\n\"You found another place you're not welcome!\"  \n\"Imeededtahangwifiend\"   \n\"Go home.  If I find you again, I'll find you a home behind bars.  Understand?\"   \n\"Ifohoomfisr\"  \n\"Good.\"   \n\nThe rest of the shift was filled with more drunk calls, a concealed weapons arrest, and lunch at the best pizza place I've ever eaten at.  It was a good night.",

Early in the day, might as well push it to the limit.  \nTop a hill and the cruise takes a second to adjust.  I am doing 68 or better.  Sherrif's car coming from the other direction.  He turns on the lights before he is even past me.  I am tagged.  Keep am eye on him while I can, spot the watertower 1/4 mile down.  \"Hmm nice parking there.\"  Slow down, use the turn signal, pull in.  Turn off car and wait.\nWallet is out.  Window is down.  Officer pulls in and approaches my car. \n\"You know why I pulled you over?\" \n\"Speeding Sir.  Here is my registration.  I am still looking for my DL and insurance.\"\nSo as this officer is standing there, I proceed to go through the stack of insurance cards in the wallet.\nUnfortunatly for me, I tend to be lazy and just stuff the newest one in, never cleaning out the old.  And I have five vehichles insured(and i get new cards every six months.  this creates quite the stack..) Queue \"expired. expired. current, not this car. expired.expired.  wrong car...\"\nOfficer:  \" Nobody has this many issurance cards without valid insurance...Have you found your liscence?\"\nMe:\"Uh... Not yet. It should be right here...\"\nOfficer:\"I see your FOID card, could I have that while you keep looking for the rest?\"\nMe:\"All yours.\"\nOfficer wanders back to his patrol car to do his thing.  \nMe?  I finally find the correct insurance card.  Then it dawns on me.  My DL is sitting on a flat bed scanner in a different State.  (long story, work related,  oversight on my part )\nOfficer wanders back to my window.\nOfficer:\"I see you found the insurance card.  Any ideas about your DL?\"\nMe:\"Uh,  yes?  I think it is sitting on a flatbed scanner in [CITY,STATE]\"\nSlight pause from the officer.\nObviouly curious about this, but almost afraid to ask:\"There has to be a good story behind that...\"\nSo I explain how my DL ended up on a work scanner in a different state.\nOfficer(obviously thinking that no one makes up stuff like this...):\"  Here is your speeding ticket. Any question on that?  I know you have a DL, just try to get it back...and slow down\"\nMe:\"I will call the person as soon as they get to work.  No questions on the ticket.\"  Afterall, he busted me fair and square on the speeding.  I run that risk.\n\nHe goes on his way.  I continue on to work and then call up the person that has my DL.  It got UPSed back next day air.\n\nThe officer could have made things much more expensive, since technically I was driving without a valid DL.  It took 10 minutes just to find the correct insurance card.\n\nHe tagged me for the speeding.  And I deserved it.  The fact he cut me slack on the rest?  While be professional and polite?  Heck no, I am not even going to blink at the speeding citation.  \n\nGnome",

The voice is coming from the next room over and is quite corporeal in nature. I shift myself off the bed and shamble sleepily towards the sound.\n\nI'm immediately greeted by a younger cop who has his Glock drawn and pointed towards the floor/my legs.

As we're having our private-public interaction, his female colleague, also with her weapon drawn, stalks up the stairs to clear the upper story.\n\nHe has me lean against the wall and pats me down before asking me to get some photo ID. I pass him my driver's license and he nods before asking me to call up my parents. After we establish to his satisfaction that, yes, I live here, I've roused myself enough to ask what all the fuss is about.\n\nMy now late dog, a seven year old female golden named Corsica, had impressive working knowledge of how doors worked and had apparently let herself out, leaving my front door wide open while she went on kooky dogventures around my block.\n\nOne of my neighbors noticed that the door was open during the middle of the morning with no cars in the driveway and had helpfully phoned the police, thinking we were being burgled.

Seeing as my dad worked IA for some years and provided her some of the more salacious details of the terrible cases he worked, I figured she'd have some inside knowledge and resolved early on to  never make the same mistakes as the target's of some of my father's investigations.\n\nFast forward a few years, after the academy and my field training, and into the formative years as a beat cop. I was working an evening shift and our overlap period with third shift had just started. Usually that meant the night slowed to a crawl and I had time to catch up on paperwork before turning it in for the day. The third shift unit assigned my area had been dispatched to an accident and I was in some dark, hidden spot when my computer blared it's alarm indicating I was being sent to a call.\n\n\"Bravo4Charlie, start for a disorderly call, taxi driver advises two fares have fled with out paying; threatening to fight caller. Subjects are white females, early twenties.\"\n\nI had worked this call dozens of times and began rolling my eyes before I even shifted my cruiser to drive. I made my way to the awaiting taxi, left idling in the middle of the road with the rear doors ajar, and spoke to the driver. \n\n\"Those two beeeches! They have not paying the fare!\" He was spitting mad and, combined with his rice-pudding-thick accent, was difficult to understand. I cajoled him a bit and he agreed to wait in the car while I went to the door of the ground level apartment he indicated the two fare jumpers had entered. \n\nI knocked on the sliding glass door, still open a crack, and in place of a reply I heard the toppling of several glass bottles. The apartment was dark except for a light down at the end of a long hall and I shined my flashlight around a bit to see if there was anything lurking. \n\nAs I scanned back to my left, my beam fell upon it: a beast from some Lovecraftian nightmare. Gently swaying in the non existent breeze and a gummy smile framed with hot pink lipstick, she attempted to make sexy eyes at me but succeeded only in slowly uncrossing them and blinking in a manner more akin to sleep than flirting. \n\n\"Where'd you come from?!?\" There were more pressing matters to attend to but for some reason I was overcome with the irrational fear this thing may have manifested from my damaged psyche somehow. \n\n\"I wuz ona floor.\" She had a trashy drawl that was slurred even worse than I would have guessed was normal for her. She poked a cheek in my direction and fiddled with her hair, trying to make the \"come hither\" expression but apparently lost the ability to keep her eyes from crossing on the process. She then pulled a cigarette butt from her tangled locks and flicked it away without acknowledging it's presence.\n\n\"Well, you owe that cabbie out there, like, fifty bucks.\" I still hadn't entered her lair but tried to be stern from the threshold. She sneered a bit then laughed.\n\n\"Nah. Becky done paid him already. You wanna come in?\" She curled a chubby index finger and turned on the charm again. \n\n\"I'm fine here. He needs his money and we can all call it a night, ok?\"\n\nShe waddled in my direction, only one high heel remained on her trotters, and adjusted the three inch mini skirt a little lower to cover her plus sized Victoria's Secret rip off panties. Her tube top had rolled up over her belly and she flattened it again before resuming our conversation. \"Becky's in the back room,\" she whispered while leaning in, the waft of cheap booze causing me to retract and form a double chin, \"and she likes ta... Paaaartay.\" She dragged the end of the word party in a gravelly, lingering attempt to sound like Tara Reid. \n\n\"I... I don't care who pays him, but he needs to be paid. Give it to me and I'll pass it along.\" I took a defensive step backwards, away from paw-swiping range. \n\n\"I'll give it to ya.\" She sniggered, and started patting her micro mini looking for non-existent pockets. \"I know I hadda condom on me...\" She muttered to herself. \n\n\"I'm only interested in the fare. Pay up and I'm out of here.\"\n\n\"Aww, don't go. I'm lonely here.\" \n\n\"Well, go hang out with Becky after you get me the fare.\"\n\n\"You're so funny!\" I turned and walked away while she giggled at me humorous retort.\n\nThe taxi driver was yelling at someone in a foreign language on the phone when I returned. \"Still working on it, but it's slow going. Give 'em another couple minutes and we'll go from there.\" I reported. \n\nA few moments later, the flirty land whale squeezed out of the sliding door followed by a mousey looking thing I had to assume was Becky. Ms. Cthulhu had taken of the stray heel and was now barefoot.\n\n\"Here's yer damn money.\" She shoved a chubby fist with what looked like sweaty one dollar bills wadded up in it towards the driver.\n\nThe driver accepted it with a growl and drove away.\n\n\"So. Wanna come in? Becky's ready to pla-aaaay...\" \n\nI looked at Becky who was obviously worse off than her pachidermish counterpart. She looked as though she was about to cry and stared off into the distance somewhere, perhaps pondering the life decisions that brought her to this point. She then projectile vomited a few hundred dollars worth of Manhattans onto the street, narrowly missing my mirror shined boots.\n\n\"I don't think my wife would approve.\" I said by way of parting words and left the pair to figure out how to best stumble back into the damp cave they called an apartment.",

        "text": "Happened 7 years ago today. \n\nI was cruising home from my girlfriends house at about 1145pm on a calm sunday night. In a slight rush because I had to make curfew for my Dad's car (12am). I was maybe going 15km over the speed limit, thought it was a safe speed. Then out of no where the world behind me went red and blue.\n\n3 police vehicles rip up behind me lights just a blazing! I being a 19 year old kid almost crapped myself and promptly pulled the vehicle to the shoulder. The 3 police vehicles proceed to box me right the fuck in. One infront, one slight behind and to the side and another to my immediate 6 o'clock. 4 Officers bounce out there doors weapons drawn and pointing right at face begin barking orders. Again 19 year old suburban white boy from Canada here, There is infact alittle bit of poop coming out now.\n\nI'm orderer to put my hands on the wheel, with my left hand open my door slowly. Put my left hand back on the wheel. With my right hand undo my seat beat. Put my right hand back on the wheel. Stick my left foot out of the vehicle. Remove my hands from the wheel and hold them up outside the vehicle. Then slowly step out of the vehicle. once I was fully outside the vehicle I was ordered to take 5 steps back. I got about 2 steps back when I ordered to halt. I could hear the officers behind me talking amongst themselves. That ment on for about 10 miserable seconds, until in a calm voice I was ordered to put my hands down and turn around. As it turns out they had pulled over the wrong guy. They where looking for someone driving the same car as mine. Same make ,same year, same colour, same trim. Who had just pulled a gun at a party. \n\nThe Supervisor with the group of cops felt extremely bad for the whole situation. Asked me if I was alright, I said I was pretty shaken up about the whole incident. He then offered to buy me a coffee and let me settle down abit before continuing my journey home. I explained that, that would put me past my curfew for the car and I would lose my car privileges for atleast 2 weeks. He took me for coffee anyways and wrote me a very well written letter to my father explaining why I was late and that it was my departments fault. He explained that I was very polite and that I fully complied with all there requests. Also that my Dad should be proud for raising me right. All in all terrifying night. And I didnt end up losing car privileges! \n\nTL;DR Got pulled over, guns drawn, I was the wrong guy, Cop took me for coffee.\n\n",

        "text": "So it's 2 in the afternoon and I'm sitting here in my PJs as pretty much my entire collection of clothing goes through the wash, when I realize that I have another story to tell.  You see, for the past two weeks I've been on a massive cross-country road trip with my best friend, over 4,000 miles from Bloomington to St Louis to Oklahoma City to Amarillo to Santa Fe to Durango to the Grand Canyon to Vegas to Sacramento and finally home to Portland.  I'm exhausted, I smell like sweat and campfires, and my legs are sore.  But it was an epic trip.\n\nNow, when you go on a trip like that, you sort of expect at *some* point to run into law enforcement.  Speeding, dead tail light on the uhaul trailer, bad lane change, drifting lanes because you're trying to stay awake, Thriller playing too loud, something.  But while we saw various cops from various agencies along the way, we never got pulled over, never got in any trouble.  So why did our car and trailer get searched twice in two days?\n\nBecause of the Hoover Dam, and the California Fruit Nazis.\n\nThe one at the Hoover Dam was uneventful.  A rather bored-looking guy in a Hoover Dam Police Department uniform came up to us at the inspection point, and sadly informed us we couldn't drive out onto the dam with the trailer.  Homeland Insecurity rules.  So we backtracked, found a parking lot, dropped the trailer, and tried again.  Now, since the purpose of this trip was to move my friend home from his grad program at Indiana University, we had his entire life in the trailer and car.  Which means the now-trailerless car is still packed floor to ceiling with clothing, artwork, a Fender amplifier, and approximately 437 scarfs (he likes scarfs).  So they can't just look in the windows and make sure we don't have a bomb.  They have to toss the car.  To the officer's credit, he was apologetic, polite, and treated all of my friend's belongings with respect.  After determining we were just a couple of guys from Portland seeing the country and NOT, in fact, terrorists, he helped put everything back in the car and waved us through.  It was worth it, [it's a pretty impressive place,](http://i.imgur.com/SOXx9s6.jpg) with some [impressive views.](http://i.imgur.com/tXAdEjN.jpg)\n\nThat night we spent in Vegas, wandering the strip taking photos and telling the strip club promoters that unless they have the same level of strip-club absurdity (and prices) as back home in Portland, they could fuck off.\n\nNext day, we head west.  Now, I've dealt with the California Food and Agriculture Inspection Stations before, namely on I-5 heading south from Oregon.  Most of the time, all they do is ask \"got any fruit?\"  Then you say no, and you keep going.  In terms of effectiveness of enforcement, it's pretty low, and it's intrusion into your life is minimal.  But the inspection station on I-15 near Yermo is a bit more....thorough.\n\nNow, the funny part in this is that the trailer was even more tightly packed than the car.  Floor to ceiling, wall to wall, nothing but big plastic totes, a large flatscreen TV, some artwork, a couple bags of clothes that needed to be washed, and a final spot in the middle for the vacuum cleaner (which was vacuum cleaner shaped, we felt like Tetris champions when we figured that out).  And in those totes is the life of a grad student - books, papers, files, crappy kitchen supplies, a Dolby 5.1 system, computer, and two large boxes labeled \"catch-all.\"  When they asked to search, I said \"sure, but I hope you have a good back.\"\n\nThey went through it all.  Each tote removed, opened, and at least partially searched.  I noticed by the end their searches of each tote were a LOT more perfunctory, and that they were all sweating and breathing hard.  4'x4'x8' may not sound like a lot of space, but you can put an extraordinary amount of weight in books and speakers in that space.\n\nAfter asking us if we had any fruit (no), any house plants (no), or any firewood (we'd burned it all days ago), we were sent on our way.  Oh, we had to repack the trailer ourselves, those guys aren't nearly as polite about things as the HDPD.  It took about 90 minutes, and during that time we were the only people to get pulled and searched like that.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't ruin our trip and for the most part we found the whole situation humorously ridiculous.  But it was also a bit of a shock to get our car and trailer searched just to see if we had a forgotten orange somewhere.\n\n[Obligatory \"yep, we went there\" photo of the two of us at the Grand Canyon.  I'm the idiot on the right.](http://i.imgur.com/bmfuCOR.jpg)",

        "text": "I was 19, and having never been pulled over before, i thought i was invincible. I was heading home from a friends house at around midnight, completely sober. At a stop light, there was this kid in a v6 mustang, that was revving the piss out of his engine, trying to act cool. Me in my corolla, i started to get irked at him and wanted to show him how driving is really done. We take off from the light, and he gets ahead initially. In my blind stupidity, I didn't realize that there was a cop sitting at the next light. He clocks me doing 83 in a 45. Because of the way the road curves and goes downhill, i was doing well over 100 by the time he pulled out. Fast forward a couple miles down the road, a bunch of stupid lane changes, and a couple red-lights run, I'm turning left off this road and dangerously at that. It is then that i notice the cop in pursuit, because i had my windows down and my music up. I pull over into a Starbucks parking lot, and wait for the cop to come up. He doest, he stays in his car and talks to me over the loud speaker, \"Stay in your vehicle, I have more officers en-route\". It is now when the brick shitting started. Three more squad cars show up, effectively boxing me in. The cops come out of their cars, guns drawn and now I'm really sweating. I was instructed to throw my keys out the driver side window, open the door from the outside, and climb out slowly and place my hands on the roof of my car. They walk up slowly, guns still drawn, and handcuff me. Fuck. The interrogation process begins, and they ask me all sorts of questions.\n\n\"Why were you driving like this?\" \"Just trying to get home, officer.\" \"Have you had anything to drink?\" \"Nope\" \"Are you under the influence of anything?\" \"Nope\" \"Do you have anything in the car that you shouldn't have?\" \"Nope\"\n\nIt was here that they decide to search my car. I was young, but I knew they needed a warrant or my permission. I decided to ask for the warrant, but the officer says we could wait for one, or I could allow them to search. Knowing I had nothing in the car, I allow them to go ahead with it, just because i wanted to get home. Three officers go through my car, looking in the cup holders, under the seats, opening the glove box. They even went as far as popping the trunk and looking underneath the spare, and looking in my engine bay in places such as the air box. Their search comes up with nothing. Same story when they brought out the K-9 Unit. The dog goes over the car three times with the officers, and still their search is futile.  It's now about 3 AM and i have like 30 missed calls from my parents. The cop decides to allow me to drive home, because I have no priors and because I was cooperative. The officer said he still had to give me a citation though, and that he would go easy on me. He gave me five tickets and charged me with a felony.\n\nFailure to yield to an officer. (Ticket) Failure to yield to traffic control devices (Ticket) Reckless Driving (Ticket) Reckless endangerment of other drivers (Ticket) Reckless disregard of traffic control devices (Ticket) Attempted vehicular manslaughter (felony) Double Fuck.\n\nI get home, I give my parents a BS excuse of how my phone died and I didn't get their calls. Next morning, i plead not guilty on everything and mail it off. Parents completely oblivious to the fact I almost went to jail the night before.\n\nFast forward a couple months, and my court date is here. Since it is a felony, i went straight to county court. The way they handle trials in my area, they'll do a couple different cases in one sitting. I was last to go in my group. A murderer gets life, a robber gets 35 years, rapist gets 28, and now it's my turn. I get called up to the defendant stand, and im freaking the fuck out. I have no lawyer partly cause I couldn't afford one, partly cause I thought  could handle it. Judge begins to review the case evidence and paper work, then looks at me. He asks me how my father is doing, and that scares the shit out of me. My father would promptly chop me up into pieces if he found out about this. I answer his questions about my dad, and my dad's business. The judge then calls a recess and asks me and the officer to follow him into his office. The bailiff walks me in and sits me down. Turns out the judge was a long time friend of my dad, and out of respect for him, he was gonna cut me a deal. He wants me to phone my dad and tell him what happened, and allow my dad to take care of the punishment. I just hold out my wrists and tell him to just give me the maximum sentence. He laughs and tells me to call him. I dial my home number, and my luck was in the sky because my brother picks up. My brother, father, and I all sound almost identical on the phone. I explain to my brother in our native language to pretend that he's my father and ill explain later. The judge cuts me off and explains to my brother, thinking it is my father, who he is and why we're calling. Told my brother what happened, judge writes something on my paper work and tosses some of it in the shredder. Walk out with completely nothing on my record. My brother didn't let me live it down for a while though. I had to be his bitch for a while, until he screwed up enough for me to get some dirt on him.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Got five tickets and a felony, walked out scott-free cause my brother sounded like my dad.",

So this weekend she signed off the title. \n\nSo I take the truck into town get some fresh fuel in it pick up some parts with my daughter. And we pass a township. No big deal. Get some stuff head back and he is camping still. Well he picked me for some reason. Wasn't speeding wasn't doing anything ( besides the plate, but he had me before that) \n\nSo we do the dance and when he ask for the papers he tells me \" be very careful how you answer that question\" I said \" okay, with a confused look) am getting the everything tomorrow\" ( which is Monday) . He said okay so no insurance and walks away.\n\nHe comes back and says the only reason you're not going to jail is because you have your daughter. ( well holy fuck!!)  He asked if I can call for a ride because the truck is not moving. I told him I could. So I call my brother to come with the truck and trailer so we can tow it home. \n\nIn the mean time another pulls up this time city. Well now I'm trying to think wtf is going on. One of the city walks up and says \"are you getting everything you need out?\"  I told him \" no, my brother is coming with the trailer\" city says \" oh he is gonna impound it. If it was me that would be fine but, ya know everyone does things their own way\". Well fuck. I asked him if he could ask the officer if the trailer would be okay then. So he does and this is were I shit.\n\nStealth mode is activated on my cop. He pops up and my window and in a very demanding/yelling to get out of the truck. I do and tells me to stand in front of the car. ( well I'm fucked right?)  He tells me if we are going to have problems he can just arrest me now and take me to jail.  I said no problems I didn't know what procedure was and so I called for a truck and trailer. He told me no I am taking it and if its a problem you're going to jail. ( mean while my daughter is in the truck bawling because daddy is going to jail.\n\nSo flat bed comes, cop tells me to go wait over somewhere else. Then drives over gets out stands at the back of the car tells me to come here. Hands me my license tells me policy that he can't. And that I should feel lucky because I am only the second person not to go to jail for the 50 he has pulled over. I tell him I appreciate it and shake his hand.\n\nIn no way was I rude, gave lip, bad tone, or even lie.  He was very \" mean\" to me and I felt like a full blown criminal.  But here is the bright side!\n\nI DID NOT GO TO JAIL!  Do as you're told don't speak unless spoken too!\n\nOh and yes I'm gonna try and fight it. And am getting my truck out as soon as the SOS opens. \n\nUpdate: got the truck out fully legal, ( with 6 months insurance prepaid). Question is should I try to fight? Its a misdemeanor charge and I do not want to go to jail or more fines. I mean I was in the wrong, ( never stated why I was pulled over.) But I thought I had some time.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: not a whole \"cop in the field\" story, just one that involves a police officer being funny that I figured I would share. \n\nSo I was discussing funny events from my childhood with my mother yesterday when this memory came up:\n\nMy cousins had family not too far from my house when I was little, who would often throw parties. On occasion, my family tagged along as well. \n\nOn one of the occasions, I think I was seven or so, a bunch of the adults were playing baseball, my father included. When he had to go get a drink, I started jumping around in hopes of taking his place. And I did, for a little bit. \n\nNow for the police bit: one of the attendees was a local police officer, who showed up in-uniform, and happened to be playing as well. If I recall correctly, either second baseman or shortstop. \n\nI had just made a swing, and began running the way only a mad seven year old boy can for first base. Then second. Then for third, when suddenly-\n\n**\"STOP, IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!\"**\n\nI turn around, and this guy's \"running\" after me, going slower than normal to be fair, since I was a little kid. In one gloved hand, the baseball. The other was outstretched in the \"halt\" sort of gesture.\n\nI decided to take off sprinting, which at the time meant yelling as I ran for childish emphasis. I get a few feet from the base, and suddenly-\n\n**\"OUT!\"**\n\nI'd been tagged by the officer following me. As I started for the sidelines, a bit pouty, my dad had just returned. Turning over towards him, the officer (can't remember his name) simply said:\n\n\"Didn't you ever teach him not to run from the police?\"\n\nLaughs were had, and I got a sticker. ",

        "text": "Here's the first (I think) fiction submission here. Basically, this is a mash up of several elements I've experienced that are too small to have their own story, placed in a historical setting with some realistic background to illustrate the similarities and differences between law and order today and of old. \n\nLet me know if you like it and I'll try some more in different settings. Criticism is more than welcome!\n\n- EMR\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nI’m a realist. I know life is a trial for everyone. I try not to dwell on my own problems because I know I’m one of the lucky ones. True, I’m no nobleman – my sparse tract of land barely grows enough food to sustain my seemingly ever growing family – but at least I have land, not to mention my supplemental income. \n\nOthers may turn their nose up at me when I enter the village square, and such is my lot in life. I take on my task and title with gusto; “Governor’s Officer of High Justice” has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?\n\nBut it’s not all pride and income my job brings me. Every day I wake I fear what the outcome of the forthcoming trials may bring. I don’t mean “trials” as in what happens in the high court; instead I speak of the matters passed down from the high court that fall on my shoulders to enforce. The High Court: faceless men with education well beyond my simple understanding that pass judgment on other men whose faces they never have and never will see – I can understand why some of the recipients of my “service” do so with such indignation.  As I said, I’m a realist. \n\nI also fear for my family’s future. Already I can see my oldest son, Adalwin, taking an interest in the tools of my trade, stealing peeks at the warrants I’m entrusted with and the blade that hangs from my belt. Mine is a job that passes down through the generations. I knew this when I took up the mantel from the previous officiate, Fridenot: a man devoured by the negativity of his work and devoted only to his wine. Fridenot knew no woman, or rather, none would know him, and filled the void in his heart with that foul, sour liquid unto the death of him. If not for my Linza having already wed me before taking on this task, I doubt I would have fared much better. I fear Adalwin will see only the “glory” and not the stark reality of my position; that he will never be able to experience the softer and gentler sides of life; that he will end up like poor Fridenot. \n\nBut, worrying is for another day. Today, I have a warrant to execute. Passed down from on high and brought to my small village by messenger, the document I was perusing had all the markings of being official – wax seal, unreadable scribbling, and some ornate drawing in the upper corner. The important parts were scrawled in a script that my less learned eye could easily decipher – Jordanes Karl – the name of the accused. \n\nI’m a patient man, having learned the skill by necessity while growing up the youngest of twelve siblings. I approached the homestead of Jordanes cautiously, listening to any variation to the chirps and whistles of the wildlife to betray mine or his presence. Smoke rose steadily from his chimney and a figure passed in front of a flame inside the poorly crafted window. I sat at the base of a large tree and lit my pipe, resolved with the fact I may be waiting a long while for the opportunity to complete my task with minimal risk to myself. \n\nI knew Jordanes, a relative newcomer to our village, only from overheard conversation at the inn. He was not a well-respected man in the community – it seemed he had a penchant for using faulty scales while dealing with the trade of goods – and as such, his plot on the outskirts reflected well his status. The land was unkempt with refuse piled about and sickly looking stock animals roaming freely through gaps in the poorly maintained fence. Empty tankards lay strewn about, likely swiped from the inn at closing and let walk away with the gruff drunkard as opposed to creating a physical altercation. I perused the scrolled parchment which brought me to this “Eden.” \n\n“Theft of fowl and hunting stock.” I mumbled to myself. Not the most severe of crimes but a crime nonetheless. No doubt Jordanes had slighted the wrong buyer who in turn had gone to complain to a person of higher status and so forth until the charges in my hand were issued by some judge wanting only to be left alone. Often men were guilty of the crimes they were accused of prior to the crier finishing reading them in open court. Such was our system. \n\nThe door to the hovel cracked open and Jordanes stumbled out. He nearly tripped, almost toppling the bucket of filth held in one hand, but caught himself on a stacked wall of field stone. I stood to a low crouch and slipped backwards behind my tree. I would watch Jordanes for a moment before approaching to assess his mental state as well as attempt to determine if he was armed. \n\nIt was a high offense to kill an agent of the High Court while in the execution of their duties but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen from time to time. News of an officer from a nearby village being stoned to death by a family refusing to pay the taxes he was sent to collect was passed among townsfolk as one would pass news of the harvest, and often with a concluding statement added along the lines of, “It goes with the job,” or “Serves him right for stealing from the poor.” They don’t see duty in the work my kind do, only a face to blame for the “justice” handed down. I’m an understanding man, and take their words with a knowledge they know not how little in the system I can truly affect. \n\nJordanes fumbled with his small clothes and drew out his member, sighing as he let loose a torrent of steaming piss directly onto a pile cow dung. I stood and tucked the warrant into my coat. I had hoped Jordanes would be so consumed with relieving himself he wouldn’t notice me for some time longer but he was more astute than I had anticipated. He glanced in my direction then shot off behind his home, small clothes still bound around his ankles and his ass exposed to the Lord. I cursed under my breath and started in my cautious pursuit. \n\nThe mix of acrid piss and fresh dung scents greeted me at the point where he started his attempt to elude me and it was a simple matter of following the trail of his reeking, bright yellow liquid emission into the woods a few yards, then the broken twigs and muffled curses a few yards further before I confronted my quarry. \n\n“Jordanes Karl?” I asked, though I already knew the answer. I am a man who follows protocol. \n\n“You know who I am you filthy swine!” He spat while still attempting to fasten his underclothes. \n\n“Yes, I do. I am here on behalf of the high court in Nuremberg. You have been accused and found guilty of stealing fowl and hunting stock belonging to the state.” I held out the rolled warrant and waited for Jordanes to accept it. He regarded it with contempt a moment before snatching it out of my hand. \n\n“Is that all? Bah! I was afraid this was something serious.” He unrolled the warrant and read it over. “I can’t read this blasted writing! So what then?! Is that all?”\n\nI tried to soften my glare into something less contemptuous but was having a hard time of it. “Well, Jordanes, there is the matter of the penalty.”\n\n“I’ve been accused and tried for worse matters in my homeland. Your threatening presence isn’t needed for me to pay a fine. How much do our great leaders demand of me, a poor trader doing God’s work in this shit-hole?”  He spat at the ground for emphasis and drew a small leather purse hanging from his neck.\n\n“Perhaps for a crime such as this they merely fined their constituents in your former place of residence, but here, in this place, there is a slightly harsher penalty.” I reached into the leather bag on my hip and pulled out my rolled leather whip. “Only ten lashings, it will be over in a moment and I will be clean with them if you don’t struggle.”\n\nI am the town executioner. \n",

It was mostly big Mexican families who lived there, plus me and two or three other younger folks. A decent building really, until it got infested with bedbugs (word of advice: diatomaceous earth). That's beside the point, though. \n\nI'd lived there for about 8 months with no real issue or reason for complaint. At the time, I drank a lot. And I mean a *lot*- I was young and in the service industry, which is a beacon for binge drinking. On this particular night (Sunday Funday, to be honest), I'd had a great deal to drink, stumbled home, and passed out around 3am. \n\nAt 5am, there is a huge, resounding **BANGING** of doors. Now, in this particular apartment building, the doors and the walls of the hallway were thin, so it was difficult to tell which door was being knocked on at any point, much less when it's the sort of **BANGING** that rattles the teeth in your head. \n\nSo, even in my quite drunken stupor, I wake up full of adrenaline, thinking, *What did I do?? Did I get that drunk last night?? FUCK!* And I practically fall out of bed. While I'm dragging on some jeans, I hear a very loud, commanding, *OPEN THE DOOR. POLICE.* Okay, so now I'm super panicked. I've never broken the law in any spectacular way, mostly minor shithead teenager stuff, so I'm both terrified and baffled (and still an unholy level of drunk). As I'm staggering towards the door (Fuck! I can't afford a replacement if they actually break it down!) I hear the slide of a chain and pause. It's immediately followed by a 'Don't shoot! Don't shoot!' I stood at my door blankly for probably 5 to 6 minutes processing (my drunk mind was still convinced I'd done something unforgivable). Finally I realized it was my next door neighbor getting raided so naturally, I put my ear to the door (I'm unreasonably nosy, which is where a lot of my stories come from). For a while it was fairly quiet, and I was pretty jacked up on adrenaline- thinking police are about to legitimately bust into your apartment will do that to you- so I finally unlocked and opened my door. The neighbor's apartment door was open, and there were a few cops and a few SWAT team guys (at least I assume that's what they were, judging by their all black uniforms, vests, and decisively frightening guns) milling about. \n\nAs soon as I stepped out, a cop noticed, and I asked if I could go out and smoke. He grinned, apologized, and said of course. So I went to go down to the front entrance and encountered what I assume were a gang of detectives, 5 or 6 of then (dressed in rather dreary plain clothes, with badges attached). They motioned to the door and I let them in. Apparently one of them worked for the postal service (my eavesdropping knows no bounds- I lingered in the entryway as they went up the stairs) and the guy they raided had been either setting up buys through USPS or mailing drugs, thus it was federal. \n\nAnyhow, I holed up in the corner of the yard with my cigarettes, called my mom to feel better, and watched while smoking probably 4 or 5 cigarettes. They had the whole neighborhood surrounded- seemed like they had expected a fight. Either way it went down very smoothly, with no argument or bloodshed or really anything interesting. \n\nThe bit that's imprinted on me, though, is after. While I was standing outside smoking  (to be honest I didn't want to go in and interrupt or anything), the SWAT team filed out. And I'll be damned if every single one of them, probably 10 or more, didn't nod their head and say 'Morning, ma'am' as they passed. For the record, I was largely trying to not-exist in a corner away from all the fun (a thread you'll find to be common in all my stories). But it made the whole encounter much more amusing. \n\nThen I went to brunch and got drunk and it became a good story to tell. \n\nFin",

        "text": "I'm on mobile, so forgive any mistakes. Also, I wasn't exactly a suspect, but it's all that fits.\n\nI live on a block that's got one foot firmly planted in a bad neighborhood, and the other dangling curiously in a gentrified neighborhood. On top of it, there are 4 major bus stops, and a fairly cheap, well known liquor store. Needless to say, it's quite popular, and the police are around nearly all the time. \n\nThis morning, while I was getting ready for work, I heard a few blip-blips of a cop car- not unusual (or cause for concern), but I looked out the window to see if anything interesting was happening. Occasionally this can be very rewarding- once I saw a handy tackle of some kid who tried to rob the liquor store, followed by a drunken bum shoving a small lady cop and being proficiently and summarily taken down, not to mention a drunk college kid get hit by a car (this actually became a very lovely scene, where two officers comforted the very terrified immigrant kid who hit him)- all in all, there's a very interesting view. No sign of lights or trouble, though. So I got all my work things and went to go out to the car. \n\nOnce I'd gotten a few steps away from my building, I saw lights at the end of the block. Getting closer, I realized my car was semi-blocked in by a cruiser and a police SUV, with several more crowded around the corner. Not good, probably, especially since there had been a murder a few blocks away just a couple days ago.\n\nLet me tell you about my car for a second. It's garbage, and old as shit. It was never well taken care of, and its make and model tends to have delightful problems with both the ignition key and the transmission (it occasionally shuts off if the mood strikes, or decides not to accelerate if there's been rain, or it's feeling cranky). On top of it, I never really moved into my apartment, so it's chock full of... well, the garbage I never saw fit to drag inside. So it has earned the moniker 'Garbage Car' over the years. \n\nAnyhow. I stopped a few feet away from all the excitement. It looked like some sort of fight  (bum fight, really- not incredibly shocking on my street). There were three cops talking to Bum 1 in the bus shelter directly in front of my car, and 4 or 5 hanging on to Bum 2 on the bumper of the SUV right in front of my car. One of the cops talking to Bus Shelter Bum noticed me hovering and waved me on with a, 'It's okay, you can walk through!' So I pointed at my car and explained  (shortly and a bit hesitantly) that I needed my car. She leaned around, eyed the space between my front bumper and the cops patting down Bum 2, and shrugged. \"You'll fit through, go ahead.\" \n\nSo I walked around the front (trying to keep as far out of things as I could) and get in. There's empty styrofoam coffee cups and cigarette packs all over Garbage Car. Admittedly I'm a little embarrassed. I stopped caring too much about Garbage Car's looks pretty quickly- it even got tagged with a sharpie and I referred to the aftermath as Garbage Car's tattoo (to be fair it's a pretty sweet looking tag). I get in, put the key in, and knowing Garbage Car, ask it nicely to start before turning the key. \n\n#*GRRRRWHEEEEEGGRRRAAAAWGGGGCLUNKCLUNK* \n\nThe head of every single cop hanging on to Bum 2 snapped around to stare. After, of course, several of them jumped half out of their skin (to their credit, none of them let go or reacted beyond a hearty jump). The battery engaged and the oldies station I typically listen to began blaring *'WE DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION, WE DON'T NEED NO SELF CONTROL.'* Ideal song, of course. Luckily on the second go (three seconds later while I tried desperately to not exist or make eye contact) Garbage Car decided it was an appropriate time to drive, and I crept away feeling fairly guilty that I hadn't thought to mention the fact that the engine has a tendency to make the sound of a herd of dying moose when it attempts to turn over. \n\nAll that said, the cops in my neighborhood are pretty cool. I have a couple other stories that I might post later. But the badges around here have always been compassionate and quick to show up and diffuse a lot of situations. I'm grateful. Sorry for surprising y'all with Garbage Car!",

Don't lie, don't be high and don't try the \"am I being detained\" none sense.\n\n",

        "text": "“Well, I think I’m heading home. Anyone have anything?” I had one arm pulled into my coat and was rounding on the other when Sean piped up.\n\n“Well, maybe. Just got off the phone with homicide.” \n\nThat sentence, at five o’clock on a Thursday evening, was possibly the most unfortunate combination of words I could have come up with. \n\n“Anything good? Need help?” I asked; one arm still encased in the warmth and symbolic freedom of my coat. \n\n“Well, yeah, actually. It’s that stabbing from two nights ago, the murder.” Sean started shuffling through papers on his desk. \n\n“The Spanish dudes? They have a suspect?”\n\n“Yeah. I guess the cousin of the victim tracked his roommate down to a co-worker’s house about an hour away.” Sean tossed me the complicated explanation like a knuckleball while still rooting through the contents of his desk. \n\n“The roommate. He’s the suspect? And whose coworker, the cousin? Or the roommate?” \n\nSean spun around in his chair and gave me a confused and annoyed glare. “What?” \n\n“Whatever.” I slipped my jacket off and slung it up on my coat hook. “I’m in.” I sat down at my desk and dialed my house. \n\n“Hello.” I could read in that first nanosecond the stress from the day burdening my wife. The kids were yelling and laughing in the background. This wasn’t going to be an easy sell. \n\n“Hey babe! How’s your evening going?”\n\n“You coming home?” She sounded defeated and I was even more disheartened with what I was about to drop on her. \n\n“Well, yeah. Eventually.” Maybe some lighthearted word play would make this easier. “Sean got a lead on a homicide.” She sighed directly into the handset and I let the silence linger a moment, trying to figure out my next move. She didn’t give me a long time.\n\n“Ok. Just be safe.” I think she said something else but a scream from my youngest kid erupted and I pulled the phone from my ear to save my hearing. \n\n“I will baby, I love you. Have a calm evening.”\n\n“Sure. You too. Hurry home.” She ended dryly and hung up; cutting off my portal to the tantrum my kid was throwing a few miles away. Now that the hard part was done, I was ready to catch a murderer.\n\nThe next several hours were filled with running backgrounds on every person we could identify living in the apartment identified by the informant and waiting on word from the detective that warrants for murder were in hand. Finally, around eight o’clock, Sean got the call.\n\n“Warrants are issued, let’s roll!” \n\nLet me tell you, if you’ve never driven one hundred miles per hour, in the dark, in a convoy of undercover vehicles with their blue lights illuminating the sound barriers and semis, while trash talking your buddies on a sideband radio channel, you need to put it on your bucket list. The sixty mile trip took less than forty minutes and we showed up amped and ready to crack some heads. \n\nUnfortunately, as is the norm in government work, our aspirations were put on hold pending some red tape we had to wade through. Apparently the boss we had coordinated with prior to our departure was surprised by underlying offense on the warrant. \n\n“I though you said it was a stabbing? Not a murder.” \n\n“Well, the two aren’t mutually exclusive. I told you it was a murder warrant stemming from a stabbing.” Sean was getting fed up. \n\n“Well, I’m going to need to write up an operational plan, run background checks on the apartment’s occupants, maybe set up surveillance, how do we even know the guy’s in there?” The boss from the other team was ticking off attempts to mire our efforts on chubby fingers. \n\nSean responded with an index finger, “One second.” He ducked into his car and re-emerged with a thick folder – the fruits of our couple-hours-long research session. “This should fix all of that.”\n\nThe boss accepted the file with a smirk, and began thumbing through the papers. Slowly, his expression changed to one of reluctant acceptance he was about to have to actually do some work. “Well,” he started, “I have to go make copies of this at a minimum.” \n\n“No need, that’s your copy.” Sean waved a second, identical file and gave a remarkably similar yet somehow still more snarky smirk back to the supervisor. \n\n“Well, it’s your show then. Lead the way.” If he couldn’t hamper our attempts to arrest this guy, at least he was going to make sure he wasn’t in the front of the line if the fan was hit. \n\n“My pleasure!” Sean jumped back into his car and nodded at my team to start suiting up before shoving a large, celebratory dip into his lip.   \n\nI donned my too-heavy raid vest and loaded up my rifle, adjusting the red dot for the light conditions and slipping an extra magazine in my utility pouch. I double checked my pistol in my thigh rig and did a battery check on the Taser in my other thigh rig before slipping on my clear shooting glasses. I contemplated my ballistic helmet for a minute and made the decision to throw it on too. I assumed I would be in front of the line making entry as I was one of the only guys on the team who spoke even a little Spanish. \n\nMy assumption was right when I rejoined Sean and the rest of the team at his car to go over our plan. “EMR, you have two spot, behind Joey who’ll have the shield. Three will be Kenny, then me, then Ed, and then whoever from the locals wants in. Keep it alert but laid-back, if that makes sense. We’re on third party operations here and if we get stuck at the door with no consent we’re sunk. It’ll boil down to a waiting game with the guy knowing we’re out there – not how I want to spend my Friday morning.”\n\nWe consolidated into two vans and trekked over to the target location. By that time, it was after nine and most of the people who had gone to work had arrived back at home. Parking was an issue but we were able to find a spot with a view of the apartment’s balcony. Lights were on inside and we could see silhouettes of several people moving about. \n\n“Well, at least we know someone’s home.” Sean said over the radio. We waited for the rest of the team to voice their ready status and then exited our cars, a mass of law enforcement from various entities making its way to the breezeway entrance. Apparently the rest of the foreign boss’s squad wasn’t as reluctant to work as he seemed. I nodded to a few strange faces as I made my way to the front of the line, stacked up on the stairs and poised to stomp up to the third floor, and gave Joey a squeeze on his shoulder indicating the line was ready to move. We wound our way through the landings and came up short of the target door.\n\nCentral American polka-esque music was only barely muffled by the flimsy door and we could hear various bouts of uproarious laughter erupt every few seconds. We were going to crash the party. \n\nJoey crept close to the door, leaning in with the clear Lexan portal of his ballistic shield to be able to monitor the peep hole for movement as I reached around him to knock.  I rapped three times, hard enough to be heard over the music. Footsteps on hardwood and Joey’s nod towards the door indicated my knock was heard and the door opened a crack, as far as the chain lock would allow. A red-tinged eye peered out.\n\n“Policía, podemos entrar?” I asked. The door shut in response but I heard the chain being fumbled and it re-opened a moment earlier. The man opened the door again, a broad smile on his face even when confronted by Joey’s huge ballistic shield.\n\n“Pase, pase, por favor!” He stepped aside and ushered our group inside. Joey hesitated but I nudged him forward a bit.\n\n“Just take the entrance while I talk to him for a second.” I whispered. Joey stepped in far enough for the rest of the team to file in, awkward and tense and scanning the sparsely decorated apartment. Joey slowly put the shield down and more than one guy had their hand on their holstered side arms. \n\n“Buscamos a Jose Reyes.” I gave the guy who opened the door the name of our target. He considered it for a moment, swaying ever so slightly and rubbing his chin thoughtfully before shaking his head.\n\n“No. No conozco.”  \n\n“Jose Reyes? Es un trabajador. Un chapin?” I put my hand up about four feet from the ground, the reported height of our murderer. “Chapines,” the slang term for someone from Guatemala, are notoriously short, and with my further description, the doorman lit up with understanding.\n\n“Ah, si! El asesino!” I was taken aback; he knew our target as “The Murderer.” I looked around for someone else to be as shocked as I was but I was the only Spanish speaker in ear shot. The man, still smiling, pointed down a hallway. “Allí esta!”\n\n“He said,” I started and paused, savoring the absurdity of the announcement I was about to make, “The ‘Murderer’ is down the hall.” Joey responded by picking the shield back up, drawing his weapon, and repositioning with a view down the corridor. Several guys jumped behind him and the new number two squeezed his shoulder to indicate the arrest train was ready to make its departure. I stayed behind with the happy/drunk homeowner. \n\nA smacking sound pulled my attention to the still un-cleared dining room area where two obese men were patting out balls of Masa for tortillas, totally uninterested in the remnants of the tactical arrest team loitering in the living room. \n\n“Tortillas.” The homeowner smiled as he took in his roommates diligently patting away. I just nodded in agreement. Shouts of orders were heard down the hall and then the clicking of handcuffs being administered. We had our man. \n\nI stood against a wall while several guys guided Jose out the door. He looked dejected, head dropped and an ashen pallor to his face.  The homeowner watched him go and clucked his tongue as he watched his former short-term roommate make his way down the stairs. \n\n“Pobrecito.” He started. “Me dijo que el hombre quien lo mató violaba al Chapin por algunas meses. El no quería pasar otra vez.” \n\nI just took him in for a moment as he still followed the arrestee exiting out of the building. I didn’t know how to reply to that. Instead, as has happened numerous times on the job while dealing with terrible tragedies, I tried to gloss it over with some parting humor. \n\n“Vamos a comer algunas tortillas?” \n\n“Si!” The somberness faded immediately from our conversation. “Vamos comer!”  \n",

        "text": "Hi Everybody.  Been far too long since I wrote anything. Seeing as /u/ElMonoRojo has written a few goodies, I figured I'd drop a new one on you about how awesome some cops in my city are.\n\nThe dual tag is because it starts out being a suspect, then progresses to something , shall we say *a little more interesting*.\n\nI was probably a third or forth year apprentice, in my mid twenties. I was a pretty big dude, hot gf, a house, a dog. Things were cool. Until the crackhead neighbour from hell moved in.  Worked at a tattoo place when he wasn't getting wasted and yelling at his pitbulls. Plural. Two of them.  And he treated them like shit. But Here's the kicker.  The previous tenants tore down the fence between the two houses. The landlord never paid them for the work, so it never got replaced.  Then they moved out, and this asshole moved in. So what do you think would happen if I had a dog, and he had bigger dogs, and there was no fence?  Yeah.  His fucking pitbull attacked our black lab.  This guy ran out there and kicked the fuck out of his dog to get it off ours.  Get him inside, get his ear cleaned up. A little bit of blood, but not much.  Dog has calmed down, neighbour just slurs a \"sorry\" at us, and goes back into his house.  GF says she's gonna call animal control.  I agree.  This guy shouldn't own animals like that.  He was a shithead who weighed 140 talking shit behind his pitbulls, and treated them badly anyway.  (Fuck him).\n\nI go to work the next day.  I get a call at about noon. GF tells me, \"It's been a morning.  Animal control came and seized the dogs, then left.  That's it.\"  No talking to, nothing, just left him.  SO this fucker comes and starts pounding on my door, threatening to kill her.  GF calls cops, then me.  I tell her to lock the doors, and not bother with the cops. GF says She knew I'd say that, and she already did. I get in my car.  I am PISSED.  halfway down the expressway, I see cherries in my rearview, and realize I'm doing 140 in a Cavalier. (*Fuck me*)  I pull over immediately.  No fucking around.  I have my license in my hand out the window before he even comes to the car.  Cop comes up, and just asks \"You got a reason to go that fast?  Is your fucking house on fire?\"  \"Nope.  Neighbour threatened to kill my GF. Gonna have a chat with him.  Just write the ticket, and I will eat it.  I don't care.  Just please write what you're gonna write, and please do it quickly.\"  Cop look at me, and says \"Hold on.\" And gets on his radio, asks to get patched into the Municipal cops as he was provincial. Asks if there is any calls at my address.  Wait a minute, and hear code 10-this, 22-that, etc.  Hear \"Warrants\" \"custody\" and other words that make me think I'm in for a shitpile of trouble. Or somebody else is, because I don't have any warrants out.  Cop just hands me my license back, and smiles at me.  \"Can this thing keep up with a Crown Vic? Follow me!\"  (WTF? HE'S LEADING ME DOWN THE HIGHWAY?)  Fucking right he is.  Right to my fucking house.  Lights on the whole way, chirped his siren through the red lights, the whole nine yards.  Get home through traffic in 25 minutes.  Arrive to a few cruisers parked in front of my house, one of which already has dirtbag neighbour in the backseat.  I get out of my car and look around.  The Cop who pulled me over walks up, and says \"I'm gonna talk to these guys a second. You might wanna take the hammer off your belt before you go inside.\" (Oops.  I was a little rushed when I left work)  I run inside, and see a blonde female officer talking to my girlfriend. Give my GF a hug, ask how she's doing, introduce myself to officer. Hear her radio chirp to life. \"Hey Carol, who's that guy?\" \"This is the complainant's boyfriend, apparently\".  Hear a chuckle over her radio \"So do we write this down as protective custody?\"  I get asked to step outside so she can continue to take GF's statement.  So I wander outside, and see that His royal fucktardness is still sitting in the cruiser.  I just amble over to him and loom over the window, giving his a scowl.  That little fuck is lucky the cops arrested him.  I was gonna beat his brains in.  But this asshole doesn't quite grasp that. He starts screaming at me from in the cruiser, and lays down and starts kicking the window, while he's handcuffed.  The cop hops out and pounds on the window. It was one of the most awesome moments I will always remember.\n\n\" For fuck's sake, will you shut the fuck up?  I want you to realize that you're going to jail. And if you fuck up my cruiser you will go to jail for a lot longer.  But you should be fucking grateful. Because if we weren't here to take you to jail, somebody else would be here to take you to the fucking hospital.  You threatened this guy's girl? Are you fucking nuts?  (He turns around and looks at me, then quickly turns back) Guys like 230, and you threaten his old lady. Nice call, numbnuts.  Guy'll rip your fucking head off if I let him.  I want you to realize that right now, the only thing protecting you from him is ***me***. And a door. *That opens from the outside*. Now shut the fuck up or I'm gonna go get a coffee. And leave you in the cruiser. On an empty street; with no witnesses. Do you fucking understand me now?\"  \n\nHe turns around, and addresses me for the first time. \n\n\"You're not gonna get to fuck him up.  We beat you to him. And he's got enough warrants and violations on him to keep him in the can for a while.  Your girl's safe.  Now go see her.\"\n\nI didn't say a fucking word to him. Just nodded, and walked home.",

        "text": "We just cleared a call at the Hotel Daisy, an upscale hotel across the street from the river.  Some 5150, dressed in a pink blazer and jean shorts claimed to be Barack Obama's son, and said Obama had booked a room for him for a week.\n\nDeputy Davis spoke with a fusion of empathy and authority. \n\n*Listen to me Marcus.  There is no room for you up there.  You are making the hotel staff and their guests uncomfortable.  If you go back on their property, I am going to arrest you.* \n\n\"Yes but I just want my room key and I won't bother em' anymore you see President Oba-\n\n*Marcus.  Do you understand what I just said to you?* \n\n\"Yes ma'am.\"\n\n*Have a good day Marcus.* \n\nWe walk back to our prowler, where our cover just pulled up behind us.\n\n*You guys code 4?*, asked Deputy Robinson\n\n*For now.  We'll probably be back here later...* said Deputy Davis.  A slight twinge of annoyance in her voice.\n\nWe shoot the shit for a few minutes, wondering where to eat for lunch, while listening to a pursuit of a suicidal subject another county over.  \n\nThe man in the pink blazer gathers his belongings from the sidewalk and eventually makes his way past us, and toward the riverfront where all the mopes hang out.  \n\nThe radio cackles again.  The dispatcher comes on.  \n\n*5Paul2*...?\n\n*5Paul2, go ahead*, says Deputy Robinson.\n\n*For you and 5Paul5: 2 ago, a mom called in and found her son on the street corner, panhandling.  Mom says he has a good 52 for a parole violation*.\n\n*5Paul2 and 5Paul5, copy. From 2nd and Riverfront.*  \n\nDavis and I get into our prowler, and follow Robinson to the call.  Deputy Robinson has arrested this subject before, and she thought she had build enough of a rapport to make him take care of his warrant peacefully.  There was foot patrol walking in the area of the wanted guy, so we were in no hurry.  \n\nAs we cruise westbound on 2nd, I observe the weekend crowd.  Battalions of families, rushing to get their Mother's Day shopping done.  Street vendors selling ice cream.  A man twisting a balloon into a hat for a little boy.  It was a stark contrast to yesterdays May-Day event, where flash bangs and pepper spray polluted the atmosphere.  \n\nThree blocks away from the wanted guy, Davis spots a sedan with 2014 tags.  \n\nShe runs the plate.  The computer makes an urgent sound.  Three times.  I knew from previous ride-along's, that if the computer makes the same sound three times, we have a stolen car.  Deputy Davis picks up the radio.  Tension and determination in her voice.    \n\n*5Paul5, to dispatch, I need you to run a plate.  One Seven Two, Charlie Lincoln Sam*\n\n*5Paul5.  The plate comes back to a Silver 2014 Lexus.  It has a good 57.  Reported two hours ago.* \n\n*No fucking way*, she says to me.  *Rollin' Stolen...*\n\n*5Paul5, I am behind this car.  It is driving westbound on 2nd.  I need a Sergeant to-* \n\nand that's when I saw it.  Out of the corner of my eye.  \n\nDeputy Robinson is scrumming with the wanted man on the corner.  Hard. \n\n I yell to Deputy Davis, who is distracted by the MDT and the stolen car, which is now speeding away in front of us.  \n \n*HEY! LOOK!*\n\nI unbuckle my seatbelt, and swing the doors of the Chevy Caprice, wide open.  I am maneuvering through the downtown crowd.  Deputy Davis sprinting behind me.\n\nThere is a huge crowd of people watching.  On the street across from us.  From the window of a Starbucks.  Filming with their phones.  Not doing anything to help Deputy Robinson.  \n\n*5Paul5, we're fighting with one!*\n\nDavis approaches, and attempts an arm-bar.  He breaks free.  He is now spinning around, trying to get the two Deputies to lose their grip of his arms.  A violent game of ring-around-the-rosie.  As they struggled more, the suspect was intentionally, or unintentionally, moving further away from the street corner, and into the busy downtown street, which had a light-rail track, and a train, pulling up to the platform.\n\nI had seen enough.  Any doubts that I had of my civilian intervention was cleared from my mind.  My 290 pound, 6'2\" frame, lunged at him.  I grabbed him, center mass, and pulled him to the deck.  I land on top of him.  My prescription Ray Ban's fall off.  Now we're in a ground fight.  Three against one.  My vision is blurry.  I see he's trying to get up again, using any traction he can get from the pavement.  I lay my entire upper body on top of his legs.  My hands are pinning his ankles to the ground so he can not kick his feet.  Amidst the scrum, Robinson's portable radio clicked on and off, letting all on the downtown net hear the sounds of the scrape.  Distant sirens grow nearer. \n\nHe gives up.  He knows he is outnumbered and hopeless.  Davis and Robinson are able to get control of his arms.  After I hear the absolutely reliving sound of the cuffs, I remove myself from his on top of his legs, and put my scuffed Ray-Ban's back on.  \n\nAll our backup arrives at once.  Two Sergeants, three Deputies.  All arriving code 3.  \n\nThe suspect's belongings are tossed.  He's stuffed into a Crown Vic. \n\nAt the scene, Sarge asks who took him down. \n\nDavis and Robinson stare at each other.  \n\n*Well... I didn't take him down... and Davis didn't take him down...* \n\nThey stare at me.  \n\n*Oh jeez,* says the Sergeant.  \n\n*I'll see you all down at the precinct.* \n\n\nAt the precinct, my mind is racing.  Was what I did going to get me in trouble?  More importantly, is what I did going to get Davis and Robinson in trouble?  My legs were literally trembling when the Sergeant came out of the debrief with Davis.  \n\nHe approaches me and shakes my hand.  He asks me what happened and why I did what I did.  \n\nI embarrassingly, like a teenage boy talking to his crush, try to blurt something out about the safety of the public, and the Deputies.  He stops me in the middle of my sentence and puts up his hand to high-five me.  \n\n*Hey.  Excellent job buddy.* \n\nDeputy Davis and I go to lunch at a sandwich shop later that day.  She gets a call on her cell.  *Oh, are you KIDDING ME?* she says into her phone.  \n\nThe stolen Lexus that we spotted before the fight, was just involved in an armed robbery at a bar.  \n\n*Well, she said.  At least I have you riding with me today.* \n\n\n",

        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A little background, at the time of this incident I lived in a largish city with a couple of major universities in it.  I happened to live near one and go to graduate school at another.  The type of residence was an old brownstone 3 story walk up. I shared said residence with someone who had been a tenet there for a few years by then.  The result of this residency is that when the closer university bought up all the buildings and basically allocated them for graduate housing, she stayed because they couldn't legally kick her out.  Basically, we were living in the middle of other grad students for a school that neither of us attended.  My room was on the back of the building against the fire escape stairs and had a regular door on the second floor (this is important).\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was a fine summer day and as per my usual habit I had the door open whilst sitting on my futon and playing some PS2 on the tv.  As I sit I hear a heavy set of steps and soon there are two people walking up these metal stairs.  I find this to be odd as I am really the only one that uses these stairs as most people enter their apartments from the front of the building.  Very shortly after the noise starts I behold a pair of local PD in black uniforms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPD1: You know anything about anyone growing marijuana here?\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMort: (pausing Gran Turismo 2) Uh..nope,  I don't personally partake of it.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPD2: Well if you do know something about it please let the people responsible know to dispose of it as there have been some reports.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPD1: We don't want to have to come out here for this as honestly we could care less about home use, just try to be more circumspect.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMort: Yes sir, you have a good day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith that they walked back down the fire escape and went on their way.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I found out later the person on the top floor had been growing in his place and the downstairs neighbor called it in when he would sit on the front stoop and smoke.  I was just caught in between.\n\n\ntl;dr: Officers come out for drug report, find long haired college student that doesn't smoke (I am so sure the officers believed me too).  Officers don't care they just want you to be better at hiding it so they don't have to deal with it.",

        "text": "I love this sub so much I thought I'd share the one and only time a cop pulled a gun on me. \n\nI was with my parents coming back from a camping trip with our camper connected to our crappy white van. We hit traffic and my parents were arguing about how to get home to avoid it. My 8 year old self was sitting in the middle bucket seat reading when I noticed the lights behind us and alerted my father. \"Must be trying to get through the traffic.\" He stated ignoring it as they continued the fight. After a few miles and the cop still on us he figured he should pull over so the cop could pass. \n\nBut he followed us to the shoulder as my dad swore under his breath wondering why. The flashlight (it was night) was the first thing I noticed but closely followed by the gun held in the cop's shaky hands as he commanded us to put our hands up. \"Me too?\" I questioned from the back startling him even more. \n\nI honestly think it was the first time he had to pull it, in the middle of Wisconsin in a area not known for much violence. His wide eyes were still focused on me when my dad softly spoke.  \"Sir? Can I ask why you pulled us over?\" The officer looked back at him calming down. \"I noticed your lights on your camper aren't working so I was trying to get you to pull over before someone hit you. When you didn't pull over I thought you were hiding something.\" My dad smiled softly. \"We didn't realize,  thank you for pulling us over. Can I get out to reconnect them?\" The office then realized he still had his gun pulled on my very passive little family and blushed before nodding and holstering his gun. \n\nAfter my dad fixed the connectors, he spoke to the officer outside the vehicle before getting back in and waving to the cop we pulled back into traffic. I still don't really know what they talked about but his frightened face when he came up to the car and his shaking gun still are clear in my memory after 17 years. \n\nTLDR : My dad has nerves of steel.",

The only vehicle at his substation that had a hitch was a confiscated Escalade. The Escalade came from some drug bust and was murdered out black with limo tint all around and aftermarket 20's. It also had a very well hidden police light package.\n\nSo he picks up the truck and is on his way to the county garage to get the sign board and stops at a stoplight. While stopped a diesel F350 pulls up, and it's obvious this guy has done some work on it. Well he pulls up and starts revving and lurching the F350 on the line. My buddy said he looked over at the guy like he was stupid, then realized he couldn't see in the SUV or see the police lights. The light changed and the guy in the truck floors it and peeled out off the line. My friend said they met at the next light and the guy started revving again. Big black plumes of smoke coming from the stacks and the truck leaning forward on the brakes.\n\nThis time when the light changed he flipped on the lights and siren and floored the Escalade. He said it bounced a little and broke traction as it went through the light. He looked back and the F350 was halfway through a quick right hand turn. \n\nMy buddy said he giggled turned all the emergency equipment off and cruised on to the garage never to see the truck again.

        "text": "The gravel crunched under my tires as I carefully backed my cruiser into the only spot in the entire parking lot shaded by a scraggly oak tree. The belts under the hood whined with every slight adjustment of the steering wheel and the clicking sound emitting from the air vents heralded the final gasps of the antique’s air conditioner. Driving “Squeaker,” the nickname passed down for the oldest car in the station’s fleet, was a rite of passage for rookies. Working the West end was another. I slid my metal clipboard from behind my seat-mounted gear bag and let loose a defeated sigh as I flipped through stack of half-completed accident and incident reports. \n\nThe West end, known mostly for the presence of the massive hospital, mental health facility, and bulk of the station’s elderly population, was busy on any shift. On day work, however, the call-for-service volume was cranked up to eleven. I fished my plastic traffic stencil out and began Picasso-ing together the diagram from the most recent of the three accidents in my stack into the corresponding box on the carbon-copy form. I was contemplating adding a few trees for flair’s sake when the radio beckoned. \n\n“7Alpha40, start for an accident, hit and run with possible injuries. Caller states his vehicle, as well as his neighbors, was struck by a red Toyota sedan. Vehicle fled the scene. Caller’s neighbor was in a vehicle, complaining of neck pain. Fifteen forty-seven.”\n\nMy hands rested on the clipboard and my jaw rested agape. I stared in disbelief at the radio speaker mounted where the ashtray should have been. Day shift ended at 1700 hours. Our schedule was structured so that evening squad came in and completed roll call in time to hit the street for a short overlap period, allowing day work to catch up on paperwork. At least, in theory, that was how it was supposed to work. I lay my head back on the headrest while my in-car computer caught up with the dispatch details and I silently prayed for my savior in evening shift form to voice up and volunteer to take my call. I knew I was staring down the barrel of an eighth report – there was no way avoiding writing a hit and run, especially one with damage. \n\nAfter several seconds of silence followed by radio traffic as usual, I reluctantly put the car back into drive and silently cursed my luck. Out of my parking lot, I turned onto a major cut through road and came to rest at a stop light, attempting a left turn. Another cruiser pulled up in the right lane and I craned my neck to see if maybe it was an evening officer I could puppy-dog-eye into helping me out. The window dropped and Devon’s smiling face greeted me.\n\n“HA HA!” His Nelson from the Simpson’s impersonation was spot on and he maintained maniacal eye contact as he tore into a gap in traffic, headed toward the station. What a douche bag. \n\nMy light changed and I continued on to my call. \n\nA few moments later, I pulled up behind the fire truck and ambulance that had beat me to the scene. I cranked the knob in my center console that turned on my overheads (somehow, the lights and siren in the cruiser were older than the car itself) and, true to the car’s reputation, they squeaked to life. As I popped out my door and onto the scorching asphalt, a particularly loud squeal from the rotating incandescent red and blue lights deafened me and I winced. \n\n“Ha! Nice car man! What junk yard did you drag that out of?” A mustachioed fireman turned from his buddies to berate me. \n\n“Just drive what they give me.” I replied, trying to shake off the ringing in my ears.\n\n“You could be riding in one of these.” He poked his finger in the direction of his giant fire truck. “Just sayin’.” He turned back to the other guys and let out a guffaw before high fives were shared all around. \n\nThe rivalry is real. \n\nI continued past without further comment and met the caller, standing in front of his destroyed mailbox with his hands on his hips while looking on to the EMT’s milling about his injured neighbor. He saw me and shook his head. “You believe this? Not even four o’clock and some drunk asshole is already out here wrecking into stuff!”\n\n“Did you see it happen?”\n\n“No, but Bill was in his car, just leaving for the store or something. I work from home and heard it happen in my office. Came out and my car was smashed and my mailbox destroyed. Bill said the guy was all over the road.” The man bent over and sifted through some mail lying in the dirt, choosing a Publishers Clearing House envelope and ripping it open as he continued. I was taking notes and looked up expectantly, pen poised for more information. “I called as soon as it happened. Bill’s being a pussy.” He flipped through the catalog of magazines being offered. \n\nI finished gathering his personal info and everything else I would need on my report before continuing to Bill. He was still sitting in his car, legs swung out the side of the driver’s door and rubbing his neck while wincing in pain. \n\n“It’s not so bad, just sore.” He labored out in response to my greeting. \n\n“Are you going to the hospital?” \n\n“No, I’ll be ok. I’ll just take some Advil, maybe go to bed early.” He stretched his neck slightly to one side then sucked in a sharp breath and winced some more. \n\n“So, you saw what happened?” \n\n“Kind of. I was in my car, about to go to the grocery store, when, “BLAM!” He suddenly sprung to life and clapped his hands together, shouting his onomatopoeia and smiling up at me before remembering his ‘neck hurt.’ “He hit me from behind.” \n\n“So, did you get a tag?”\n\n“No, he was swerving all over and I was hurt, y’know?” \n\n“Your neck started hurting that fast?” \n\n“Yeah, real quick.” He suddenly looked concerned. “That happens.” \n\nI gathered the rest of his information for my report and made my way back to the cruiser. The fire truck was pulling away and my mustachioed friend was behind the wheel. He threw me a thumbs up and blasted his air horn, deafening me a second time. I waved in response and took note of his belly laughs as the truck’s diesel exhaust enveloped me. \n\nTwo business cards with two case numbers later (each car crash event was its own report) and I made it back to my still squeaking car. I felt the weight of nine unfinished reports and sighed as I took note of the clock – 4:34. It was shaping up to be a long evening. I put the car in drive, waved to the caller, who was gazing critically at Bill, and pulled down the street to make my way back to the station. \n\nI made it to the next intersection, checked it was clear, and was about to commit to my u-turn when something caught my eye: a trickle of dark fluid zig-zagging its way deeper into the neighborhood. I realized I was at a literal crossroads. Turn around and write up my book of reports? Or head the other way and do my due diligence in investigating a potentially drunk hit and run offender? I thought of some of the senior guys on my squad – those few guys who spewed vitriol at every opportunity, jaded by years of pushing a cruiser with half-hearted enthusiasm and were always happy to welcome all comers to join them on the dark side. That wasn’t who I wanted to be.\n\nI cranked the steering wheel, which squeaked in protest, and headed in pursuit of my offender. \n\nI had to lean my head out the window to see the trail. I crept along, scanning the street as well as the path ahead and, to my dismay, noticed a few other cars with what appeared to have fresh damage. More reports!\n\nAround a corner, down another street, I found my prey: an older model sedan butted up against yet another parked car. The vehicle was still idling and I could see someone seated in the driver’s seat. \n\n“7Alpha40, start me one more. I’ll be out with the suspect vehicle in my wreck, 14th and West Street. Vehicle is occupied.” I stepped out of the cruiser, overheads squeaking away once again, and slowly approached the car. The man in the driver’s seat was slouching forward and I took his moment of inattentiveness to survey the car’s contents: a book-bag, an empty diet Pepsi can, a carton of orange juice like you’d get at a school, some scattered CD cases, and, much to my chagrin, a large, grey pit bull panting heavily and staring at me inquisitively from the front passenger seat. \n\n“7Alpha40, if you could, please start animal control this way too. I have a large pit bull in the car.”\n\nThe dispatcher responded. “7Alpha40, 10-4, I’ll start animal control but be advised, they are on the other side of the district. Also, I have no one to back you; Bravo units haven’t cleared the station yet.”\n\nIt was almost five o’clock, my quitting time, and still I was getting boned by evening shift. I’d have to go it alone. I drew my baton and rapped on the window. The driver had no reaction and the dog shifted in his seat, rotating his head trying to figure out what I was up to. \n\n“Sir! Wake up!” I knocked again. This time, the man rolled his head to the side and slowly opened his crossed eyes. He swayed in his seat and flopped his right arm up in down in the direction of the gear shift. I went to open the door but found it locked. The driver’s window was barely cracked but I could tell the AC wasn’t on. It was scorching outside and I could tell by the dog’s heavy panting that the car was quickly heating up inside too. \n\n“Unlock the door, sir.” I gave it as an order, getting angrier by the moment at the audacity of the driver. “Turn off the vehicle and unlock the door, now!”\n\nThe man groaned an incomprehensible reply and flopped his head and shoulders back into the seat. The dog readjusted again in his seat, wondering what my next move was going to be. I thought it over and circled the car. The dog tracked me and I noticed his window was lower than the driver’s. \n\n“Oh, what the fuck!” \n\nI spun around and noticed a man holding his head in his hands, taking in the scene. By his gaze, I assumed he owned the parked car the offending vehicle was resting against. “This yours?” \n\n“Yeah, man. What the hell dude!” He yelled at the driver who replied with another lull of the head. \n\n“Well, I’m trying to sort it out but the door’s locked and he’s not looking too friendly.” I motioned to the dog and the new victim grimaced a bit.\n\n“Well, he’s got to pay for this.” He went back to surveying the crash. \n\n“Yeah, and the three or four more down the street.”\n\n“What’s going on?” A girl came walking out of the house and was addressing the new victim. \n\n“This dumbass wrecked into my car!” The scorn exuded from him and he glared at the driver. The woman looked concerned, more for the driver than the damaged car. \n\n“What’s wrong with him?” She asked.\n\n“Drunk, I guess. He’s not answering questions, a little slow on the uptake and all.” I knocked on the window and the dog licked his chops and readjusted again. The driver rolled his head in our direction and flopped his arm onto the seat, just behind the dog. \n\n“You sure? It’s awfully early to be drunk.” The woman came closer. “I’m a nurse, just finished my shift about an hour ago.” I nodded back, not sure how the nurse info was helpful but agreeing it was early to be drunk. I walked back to the driver’s side and the dog tracked me once again. \n\n“Sir?” The women leaned towards the passenger window but not close enough to be within lunging distance of the dog and brushed her hair behind her ear. “Sir? Are you OK?” \n\nThe man’s head was still pointed in her direction and he perked up slightly. He lifted his right arm again, as though reaching for the lady and then bent it up around his dog’s neck. He began panting heavily, the man now – the dog had been panting the whole time- and a thick drop of drool slowly leaked from his mouth. \n\n“I… think there’s something else going on here.” The woman stood up, the concerned look more intense now. \n\nThe man’s arm tightened around his dog’s neck, bulging the loose skin out around his bicep. He was clearly straining with a good deal of force and for the first time since I arrived, the dog took his attention away from me. It began pulling back but was unable to break the driver’s choke hold. The dog’s eyes began to bulge. \n\n“Holy shit, he’s killing his dog!” The owner of the parked car yelled.\n\nThe woman started chanting, “No no no no no” but was too afraid to get any closer to the car than she already was. She looked to me for help.\n\n“Wow, ok… you guys have any rope or anything? A spare dog leash?” Without reply, the parked car owner sprung to action, sprinting to the garage. I trotted over to the dog’s door, and hesitated. I was about the trespass in a very large pit bull’s personal space and wasn’t too comfortable with it. The dog jerked his body back again in another failed attempt to escape. I thrust my hand in and unlocked the doors before pulling it back out. The parked car owner returned with a garden hose.\n\n“It was the best I could find.” He apologized. \n\nI opened the door and noticed the dog’s ears perk up. I breathed a deep breath and counted to three in my head before thrusting one end of the hose into the car, tucking it under the dog’s collar and looping it back towards me. The dog thrashed but was still unable to break the man’s still tightening grip. The driver let loose a gurgling moan. I tied the hose as best I could back on to itself and handed the other end to the woman. I then trotted over to the driver’s door. \n\n“Make you have that hose - tight.” I ordered before opening the door. The man didn’t react but the dog’s bulging eyes, the white’s exposed now on all sides, fluttered over me. I thrust my baton into the man’s grip and used it as a lever to break his grip, bracing one side on his shoulder while the other end fit into his crooked wrist. \n\n“Pull the dog out!” The guy was strong but I had Archimedes on my side and slowly I pried him arm open. The woman yanked the hose and the dog scrambled backwards, out of the car. A cloud of shed hairs drifted in its wake. \n\nThe woman handed of the dog to her boyfriend and rushed over to the driver. “Call for an ambulance, I think he’s in a diabetic emergency.” She leaned in and began her nurse duties. I called for rescue. The dog paced the sidewalk, coughing and wide eyed but otherwise unscathed. The owner of the parked car looked like he was holding a lit stick of dynamite on the other end of the hose and fed out as much length as he could to encourage some distance. \n\n“He’s got some stuff in the back here, will it help?” I asked the nurse. She glanced back and yelled her reply.\n\n“Orange juice!”\n\nI scrambled to comply and passed it forward to her. For a couple minutes she tried to coax some down the man’s throat. The sirens from the rescue vehicles were a harbinger of their arrival. It was the same crew as before. \n\nI backed out of the way and started taking notes on the vehicle tag and registered owner. The mustachioed firefighter meandered over. \n\n“Hey Holly. Pleasure seeing you around here.” His swagger was laid on thicker than his after shave. “Didn’t know you had a life outside the ER.”\n\n“Chad.” She replied without looking up. \n\nThe firefighter sidestepped an EMT trying to get to the patient. “So, rook.” He turned to address me once he had drunken his fill of Holly’s figure. “Guess you solved a major caper!” He cackled and looked for someone to high five but no one else was paying attention to him. “How’s that jalopy treating you?” He looked over my shoulder at my ancient cruiser, the squeals from the lights audible even at ten yards away.\n\n“Good.” I answered. \n\n“Still think your ride is better than mine?” \n\n“Never said I did.” \n\nHolly apparently was fed up with Chad’s presence. “Look, Chad. You can stand around here berating a real hero’s vehicle and getting in the way, but you’d be a lot better off back at the station playing your Nintendo in my opinion. Go climb back up into your massive compensation for lacking in ‘another area’ or help stabilize this guy!” I liked nurses. I tried not to smile or look at Chad’s reaction but noticed his shoulders slouch in my peripheral. \n\nHolly turned back to the car and the EMTs hard at work and Chad puffed his chest out again before spinning on his heal and walking briskly back to the shiny fire truck.\n\n“Firefighters, am I right?” Holly laughed. \n",

        "text": "Long read ahead ladies and gentlemen. I've been lurking on this sub for a while; I really enjoy the stories, especially considering that I intend to become an officer. If everything goes as planned, I'll be attending a nearby department's academy in November. Until then though, I've got a few stories, mostly ridealongs and stories from LEO friends of mine. There's this one time, though, during my time in college, in which I and my roommates were the suspects. \n\nThis happened back in 2012. It all starts when I lived in (redacted), a semi-rural college town. I rented a four-bedroom house with my best friend, his brother, and a \"friend\" of the brother. We're pretty redneck, and as this was in college, we tended to have parties and bonfires every weekend. \n\nAt one of these parties, the \"friend\" had invited another two of his friends to come party with us. One of them (D1, for Douche 1) was a student at the same school we went to, and the other (D2) lived in the bigger city about 40 miles from us. These two guys, along with \"friend\" got belligerently drunk the Friday night of our party. No big deal, usually, except that D2 decided that hooking a tow chain from his truck to the stop sign on the corner our house sat on and pulling it out was a grand idea. He pulled it clear out of the ground.\n\nNot to be outdone, D1 wanted to steal the stop sign from the other corner, diagonal from our house. He didn't have a tow chain, though. He had an oxy-acetylene cutting torch, however. He cut the sign off at the base on the ground.\n\nAfter celebrating with their signs and parading them through the house into our fenced backyard, they laid them against the house, straight up in the air, for the world to see. I remember thinking (in my also slightly drunken haze) that this would not be ending well. I went to bed shortly after. \n\nThe next morning, my best friend is sitting on the couch playing WoW on his laptop, when he is interrupted by loud, heavy knocking at the door. You know, the cop knock. He opens the inner door, leaving the outer glass door closed, and greets the officer, then says \"I bet you're here about them signs in the yard.\" The officer confirms his suspicions, then asks if the city can just have them back or if he'll need to get a warrant to come back for them. Best Friend says \"Hell, if you want, I'll just tip them over the fence for you.\" The officer laughs and asks how heavy they are, to which Best Friend replies \"I have no idea.\" The officer laughs again and says that was the best answer he could have given. \n\nBest Friend goes and tips them over the fence for the city workers, then comes back in. The officer tells him he has a few questions for him, and Best Friend says he'd prefer to come wake me up to help answer the questions, as I had actually seen who took the signs. Officer says sure, so Best Friend comes into my room. He kicks my bed and says \"Hey, TheFirefighter. Wake up, the cops are here.\" He later says that's the fastest he ever saw me get out of bed. By the time he returned to our kitchen (a 15 foot walk) and the waiting officer, I was up, dressed, and coherent enough to answer his questions. \n\nThe questions were simple; he told us that if we'd give up the ones who actually took them out of the ground, they wouldn't charge those of us on the lease for being in possession of stolen government property. I told him that I didn't know their real names (they went by nicknames), but if he didn't mind me making a few quick phone calls, I'd gladly tell them who they were, where they lived, and anything else he needed. He gave me the go-ahead, so I called Best Friend's brother, who, upon hearing the situation, immediately gave me names and addresses, down to the dorm room number of the one who went to school with us. Officer thanked us for our time and went about his day.\n\nI later learned that Officer tracked the two of them down and fined the both of them rather than charging them, since the property had been recovered. And D2 wasn't invited to our house again, as it had been his drunken idea. We mostly forgave D1 because peer pressure and all that.",

        "text": "I love my wife.  We've been married for almost a decade now.  We dated for less than a year before getting engaged, and were married before the seasons changed.  She's my best friend, and we have always been affectionate to each other.  Lately, the little things can be difficult to be affectionate about.\n\nWe were at the mall.  She needed a new dress for some event at work, I needed my hair cut.  I got a sweet hair cut and she got her beautiful dress.  Being the lovey dovey couple we are, we were happily holding hands walking through the mall.  Then she squeezed my hand.  Then I wasn't in the mall anymore.  I was in the median, next to a totaled car.\n\n\"Caller states she saw a vehicle ran off the road into the trees,\"  dispatch informed us, just as we sat down to eat.  My shift partner got the call.  Noone else had reported it, so it was probably nothing.  Usually someone starts to run off the road and corrects, or stops for a flat tire.  People assume the worse.  My partner leaves his lunch to go check, and talk to the caller who is still in that area.  He had already ordered his food, so we said we'd bring it to him.\n\nThe food came out just as he left, the rest of us ate real quick, and I grabbed his food and started heading that way.  The caller had stated the guy ran off the right side of the road heading West.  I had to come East to meet up with them.  Along the way I was checking the median, not expecting to find anything.  As I was about to make U-turn at the crossover, I saw it.  A red car in bad shape deep in the trees.  This wasn't just a flat tire, this was a crash, a bad one.  Usually after the crash people are outside of the vehicle, but there was noone there.\n\nI pulled into the crossover, called for rescue.  As I approached the car I stopped.  Anyone inside had to be dead.  The roof was flush with the doors.  It looked like it had been through a car crusher.  You could see bark missing from where it hit the tree 15 feet in the air.  You could see where his tire marks stopped as he ran off the road.  The music from the radio was deafening.  I turned around to tell my shift partner, and stopped.  I had to go look in the car, I had to see it for myself.  \n\nThe seat was bent 90 degrees at the back.  The ceiling of the car was flush his face.  Blood was dripping from his ears, shattered glass everywhere, and a pool of blood congealing like  spilled ketchup in the backseat.  He couldnt talk, but he was conscious.  He could see me.  He could look at me.  I held his hand, and talked to him.  It was all I could do.  Even if keeping his spine stable wasn't a concern, the car was so mangled around him, it would be impossible to get him out without extraction tools.  I talked to him.  I told him it was going to be okay.  I told him rescue was on the way.  I told him I was going to see him in the hospital.  I meant it.  I hoped it.  \n\nI had to yell on the radio to tell dispatch to make sure rescue steps it up and is ready for an extraction.  The music was so loud.  \"Party like its the last day of your life,\" the lyrics went.  I don't know what the song was, and I can't bring myself to google the lyrics.  Even over the music, I could hear his gurgling.  He couldn't talk, but I could.  It was all I could do.\n\nIf that lady hadn't called it in, she was the only one, he would've been there alone.  In the summer heat.  Just him, the mosquitoes, and that music.  Hundreds of cars driving by just feet away, but unable to see him through the trees.  I don't know how long it took rescue to get on scene.  It was probably only 5 or 10 minutes, but it felt like an hour.  I can't bring myself to open the CAD history and find out.  \n\nWhen they did arrive, you could see his excitement, he knew he was getting out of that car.  A few minutes ago he seemed destined to die alone, trapped.  Then we got there, and even though he wasn't trapped, he had someone.  Now he was about to be freed.  I told him I was going to let go.  I hadn't this entire time.  I had just been sitting there, talking, saying anything I could to try to help.  As the firefighters came over with their tools I stood up.\n\nAnd he squeezed my hand.  I had to pause to tell him its going to be okay, again.  To tell him they were going to get him out of there, that I'd see him in the hospital.\n\nThe got him out quickly.  Less than 5 minutes, and he was in the back of the ambulance heading to ICU.  The had to saw the entire roof of the car off.  I heard from one of the other medics that as soon as he got into the ambulance, his vitals started dropping.  \n\nDealing with dead people never bothered me.  Maybe its a plausible deniability  thing.  I don't know who this person is, they were probably alive at some point, but i don't know them, never met them.  Now they are just evidence.  Piles of carbon and water that are a piece of the puzzle of what happened.\n\nTelling someone their loved one is dead is harder.  When we do it, its not like in a hospital.  Its out of the blue.  Its waking someone up at 3 in the morning to tell them their son was killed in a crash, or their wife was hit by a car.  You have to do your best to help them, but you hurt too.  You feel their pain.  Its not just a piece of evidence any more, its their family. \n\nDying people are different though.  You know that person, however briefly, and there’s nothing you can do.  Everything is just stalling for time, but death wins.  Usually sooner than later.  \n\nA few hours after the shift was over I got a text from my shift partner who worked the crash.  He died a few hours later in the ICU.  \n\nIts been months, maybe a year, maybe more, I can't remember.  I don't want to remember.  I have to drive by that spot every day, see that tree, see that crossover.  I can usually block it out.  I can live day to day not thinking about that summer afternoon, that mangled car, that loud music.\n\nUntil she squeezes my hand.",

        "text": "Long time lurker on this sub. I have always enjoyed the stories, but never felt that I had anything to contribute, until tonight...\n\nI work as a Patrol Officer on a University Campus. We run 2 man squads, and most of my nights usually involve parking lot checks, and traffic enforcement, with the occasional call for service. It's 2 hours into the shift, and unusually dead for a Friday night. After checking the Campus, My partner and I decide to perform some stationary radar enforcement. \n\nOur Campus has a fairly long entrance drive in from the main road, that terminates at a 3 way intersection. I have a favorite spot that allows me to sit at one point of the intersection, and \"shoot\" radar up the entrance drive. So, we set up, and since it's quiet, kinda get into talking about life, kids, etc. \n\nOur Campus has a posted speed limit of 20 MPH, and we enforce it pretty heavily, as there is usually a lot of pedestrian traffic, and we have had a few \"Vehicle vs. Pedestrian\" close calls in recent months. However, speed enforcement is usually secondary to babysitting the Stop Signs at this intersection.\n\nSo, We're chatting and watching the Intersection, and about 10 minutes in, we get a tone on the Radar Unit. I look up at the display, and see 42 MPH. I lock the speed, and wait for the approaching vehicle. A few seconds later, and a blue 4 door with multiple occupants comes up to the intersection. After stopping, they proceed into Campus. \n\nI pull out behind them, and follow for about 100 yards before activating the lights. Vehicle pulls over immediately, and vehicle's  4 way's come on. My partner calls out the stop to Dispatch, and since I'm driving, I get to do the approach on the vehicle. Partner and I both exit the car, and as I approach the Driver, My Partner takes up cover position on the Passenger Side Rear corner of the vehicle. \n\nI walk up to the Driver's Door, and realize that the vehicle is occupied by 4 Female Students. I ask the Driver for I.D., and She complies immediately. The verbal exchange I had follows:\n\nMe: (Looking at Driver's I.D.) \"Miss _____, do you know what the speed limit is on Campus?\n\nDriver: \" 20 miles per hour\"?\n\nMe: \"Correct. Do you know how fast you were going?\"\n\nDriver: \" 30, I think.\"\n\nMe: \" I have a radar lock on your vehicle at 42. Can you explain why You were driving so fast?\"\n\nDriver: \"Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. I just got my nipple pierced (points at Left Breast), and I'm rushing back to my dorm to put some ice on it. It hurts like Hell.\"   She then produces a receipt from a local tattoo place, showing payment for said piercing. \n\nI glance back over the roof of the car to my Partner, who is doing everything within his mortal power not to burst out laughing. I smiled, handed the Driver back her I.D., instructed her to drive safe, and released Her with a verbal warning.\n\nI've been performing traffic stops since 1985, and unknowingly, She just made my top 3 excuses of all time.\n\nEdit: OK,  I have been challenged by the fine readers of this sub to give the other top 3 excuses that I have received over the last 29+ years. Watch T.F.T.S.C. (this sub) for more. I'd do more now, but just got off a 12 hour shift with an 8 hour turn around to another 12. ( Some of you will be able to TOTALLY relate)",

        "text": "This story comes from a couple years ago.  I was roadtripping from Portland down to Sacramento to visit friends.  Right at the Oregon/Cali border, just after the fruit nazi stand, an older guy in a beat-up old pickup comes out of no where and comes within inches of side swiping me.  After forcing my heart to accept a normal rhythm again, I notice that he's wandering all over the highway.  He's across all three lanes like my dog across my bed.  After he nearly hits another car, I call 911 to report him.  A CHiP comes in behind me at the exit for Weed (heh heh) just in time to see the guy swerve in front of a semi.  Lights flick on and a traffic stop is started, meanwhile dispatch tells me to pull in behind the officer, another officer will be with me shortly.\n\nI come to a stop, and another cruiser fills my rear window  A rather baby-faced sergeant comes up, resplendent in his tan uniform and jodhpurs, asking for my license, and has me relate what I saw.  During this time, the driver of the pickup gets out and promptly falls flat on his face, drunk as Mark Wahlberg on the Graham Norton Show.  The sergeant stares at this for a moment contemplatively, then hands me back my ID and thanks me for reporting this.  Awesome, I helped!\n\nThe story doesn't end here.  Moments after i left, with that first stop still visible in my rearview, a car with no visible plates or temporaries nearly hits me going far too fast for prudence.  I follow at a descreet distance for a while, watching him weave back and forth.  Well, fuck, better call 911 again.  I get the same dispatcher from before, assure her that I'm not abusing 911, and that there really IS another possible drunk driver.  It takes a while, but eventually another unit comes up behind me, and soon after sees the guy squeeze past two trucks on the inside shoulder.  Again, I'm told to pull in behind, but this time the attempted stop turns into a pursuit.  Dispatch tells me to hang back (like I could keep up in my 626 anyway).  About 10 miles on, the guy lost control and ended up nose-first in a bunch of Madrone bushes, the patrolman almost vaulting the suspect car to cover the driver.  I park some distance away, not wanting to end up as a bullet backstop.\n\nSoon enough, there's a tap at my window, and the sergeant from before is smiling at me.  We laugh at the ridiculousness of two DUIIs that close together at 11am as several other officers secure the suspect and his car.  He thanks me again, and I head off.\n\nBut the story isn't over.\n\nI get down to Sacramento.  Meet up with my friends.  Drink.  Play on the river.  Eat some awesome food.  Good times.  But eventually, I have to go home.  And again, right outside of Weed (heh heh), I come up on a guy doing about 20 less than the posted speed limit.  I initially thought that maybe he just had weight in his truck or something, but right after I pass him I see him in my rearview veer off the highway and crash into the ditch, nearly flipping over in the process.  I pull to the side of the road and run back, to find him slumped over the wheel.  911?  Hi, need to report a single-vehicle accident.  Oh, and there are a bunch of empty beer cans in the cab of his truck.  Yeah, I'll wait.\n\nTake a wild guess who showded up.  Yup, that's right, our hero sergeant from four days earlier.  He just stopped and stared at me to which I responded,  \"I swear to God, I'm really not trying to do your job.  But, you know, if you're hiring...\"  He proceeds to bust up laughing, unable to speak for some time.  Fire and an ambulance roll up, and he just waves me on, still giggling.  I made it home with no further incident, but about a week later got a nice letter from that sergeant, thanking me for being so vigilant.  Along with an application for California Highway Patrol.\n\nTL;DR - Right place, right time, times three",

Usually we march down with the drumline playing a cadence as we head down, do some stretching and physical exercises, and some warmups.  Nothing outside the scope of band.  Well, one of the neighbors in this upper middle class area this year suddenly didn't like that we were warming up so early, after living there for probably 10 years.  So, well within his rights, he called the police and reported a noise complaint.  In reaction we toned down a bit for a few days, but he still called in complaints.  Eventually this lead to the police coming down to see us.  Apparently he called in one of his complaints on a day when we weren't even playing.  Now the officer realized it was all shit, so she laughed with our director about the absurdity of the situation.  However the complainant had a point, the statute for noise violations didn't exempt us.  Our director was given a summons to court to potentially be fined.\n\nThis is where I come in.  Band is one of my best activities and one of the few places I'm accepted fully.  So I decided to contact the city council, particularly a local who happened to play saxophone in their high school and went on to be on the council.  He agreed with me and worked with the police chief to get an exemption, as well as getting the charges dropped.  When I told my director he was thrilled.  Apparently it was the conversation of the school's jazz band class (which is about 50% chilling out with the director and 50% rehearsing which gets more done than two and a half hours of marching band rehearsal) for three months.  Until someone stole from the music parent fund.  But that's another story.\n\nEdit: Tl;Dr: Just here so we don't get fined.",

        "text": "Hey all, I know it has been awhile since my last submission. I haven’t known what to write about. The following stories will be from my time in the Firearms Training Simulator.\n\n\nThe Firearms Training Simulator, also known as FATS, is a training system used to put cadets into realistic shoot/don’t shoot scenarios. It uses a large screen or screens that show a video. It also uses realistic firearms that shoot out infrared light, kind of like laser tag. All the action occurs on the screen. The gun we used was the Glock 17. It operated just like a real weapon, with reloads, aiming, slide motion, and such.\n\n\nThere is an operator on a computer behind me. He runs the simulation. He decides how the simulation plays out depending on what I do, what commands I give, etc.\n\n\nThe videos are live actors and the camera perspective is from “your” point of view. In the stories, as with the Use of Force Scenarios in my last submission, I will write as if I was there in real life and I will write END SCENARIO when the simulation ends. Feel free to comment, ask questions, etc. about any simulation or about the Academy in general. I will gladly discuss my actions and explain my thoughts on each one in the comments :)\n\n\nI hope you all enjoy\n\n\n**Car Stop**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I am on regular patrol when I see a red sedan run a stop sign. I sped up to conduct a traffic stop. Upon seeing my lights, the car makes a left turn and pulls into a parking lot, but parks at an angle with the rear-driver’s side door facing me. The driver, a younger white male, immediately exits the vehicle and begins yelling in my direction about how the police are harassing him. I give him verbal commands to get back into his vehicle. He just continues yelling and waving his hands in the air. Suddenly I see the passenger exit the vehicle and run away. I see this as I am commanding the driver to return to his vehicle. I notice the passenger turn and face towards me. He has a gun. I draw and fire 4 rounds towards him. 3 strike him and 1 hits the rear of the car. The driver immediately goes prone and yells to not shoot. I proceed to do a high-risk style arrest of the driver, making him walk towards me and all that. The passenger was dead.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**Kidnapping In Progress**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I am on foot patrol in a city park. A small boy runs up to me and says that a man has grabbed his friend. I make contact with the man, who is pulling the boy towards a van. I unsnap my weapon and have it tucked behind my leg just in case this is an actual kidnapping and the man tries to harm the child. He releases the boy and raises one hand. He turn and has a revolver in his other aimed at me. I fire about 10 rounds at the man, most hit him. The rest go into the van. He does not get a shot off.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**Off-Duty**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I am riding passenger off-duty. I see a police officer conducting a traffic stop. It is a smaller road, the traffic stop is on the left hand side and we are driving on the right. I see the cop and subject talking then the subject tackles the cop and they disappear behind the subject’s car. I get out of the vehicle and go to assist the cop. When I see him again, he is on his stomach and appears to be unconscious. The subject is striking the cop multiple times. I give commands to stop as I approach. I draw and again command the subject to stop, still approaching. The subject ignores my commands and begins to strike the officer in the head with his foot. I shoot the subject 3 times in the back.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**House Raid**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I am the 4th person on a tactical team conducting a raid on a house. We make entry and there are 2 subjects in a living room on the right. Officer 1 takes control of them and they comply. A subject with a gun comes out of a door on the left. Officer 2 engages him and takes him out, then proceeds to handcuff him. Officer 3 and myself continue into the house and come up to a bedroom. There is a subject inside on the bed. He complies and Officer 3 moves in to cuff him. The subject then starts fighting Officer 3 and begins to remove Officer 3’s handgun from its holster. I command the subject to stop or I will shoot and he continues to remove the firearm. I shoot 2 rounds into the subject.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**Business Hostage Rescue**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I was a member of the tactical team again. This time we are making entry on a business that is being held by several men in camouflage armed with AK-47s. We make entry and the Officers in front of me take out 2 men. I am point walking through a hallway by a desk when another subject pops up, I shoot 7 times and hit him 6. The 7th shot went into the wall.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**Parking Garage Hostage Rescue**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I was yet again a member of the tactical team. There is a car with 2 subjects and 2 hostages. We make contact with the subjects. One exits with a gun pointing at the hostage, I shoot him in the head. The other complies.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**Mall Patrol**\n\n\nIn this scenario, I am on foot patrol in a mall. I see a male subject at the fountain. It appears he is urinating in it. I make contact and ask him what he is doing. He turns around and faces me. In his hand is what appears to be a detonator. He presses it. There is a large explosion.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO\n\n\n**ATM Burglary In Progress**\n\n\nIn this simulation, I am again on foot patrol in a mall. I hear a noise coming from around the corner. I see a male subject at the ATM. He is doing something to it. I give him verbal commands and he turns and has a screw driver in his hand. I draw my weapon and tell him to drop the screw driver. He charges at me with it so I shoot him 3 times.\n\n\nEND SCENARIO",

        "text": "So I'll preface this by saying somehow I've earned the title of 'shit magnet' in my county. In my first month out of FTO and on my own I had more dangerous runs then some guys see in a year. \n\nI was working an evening shift finishing Taco Bell in my squad, when I see the call show up in CAD. 'Trouble with' area 4. No sooner had a clicked the call dispatch was sending units. It was a domestic disturbance with the suspect having a gun. Immediately I threw my tacos to the side and backed onto the run. My partner hearing my traffic does the same. \n\nAfter hauling as through country roads we arrive, I flash my lights as my partner passes the house zooming down the street. I jump out of my car and immediately draw and position my sidearm at my side. \n\nWith my partner behind me I approach the house, pounding on the door I eventually hear a voice telling me to come in. I enter the dwelling with my pistol up not sure what's coming next. Quickly I realize this situation is worse then we first thought. It's a hoarder house and I'm crushing peeps and other junk food with every step.\n\nI'm informed that the suspect and gun are in a bedroom. Tactically it sucks, I'm in a kitchen knee deep in fucking peeps and broken hopes and dreams praying that this guy complies. The door to the bedroom is closed, I position myself to the side with my partner behind me and start yelling commands. \n\nNow I'm not the toughest guy by any means. Most of the guys I work with have never heard me raise my voice let alone scream.\n\nAt first I'm stern but quiet as my pistol is raised concentrated at the door \"you inside come out with your hands up. Police department\" no response. I ask again \"come out with your hands up\" nothing.\n\nI then begin screaming \"POLICE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP\" then I hear the door handle begin to turn. I'm terrified, that were about to get into a shoot out. The door slowly opens. The man behind it is fucking huge. Atleast twice my size, and won't show me his hands. SHOW ME YOUR FUCKING HANDS NOW! HANDS UP. I begin screaming at the top of my lungs. The suspect acts like he doesn't hear me. Finally I get eyes on both ands and confirm he doesn't have a weapon in hand. Quickly I holster my gun and withdraw my taser. Thinking my partner is still concentrated on him with lethal force.\n\nTURN AROUND AND PLACE YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD I scream as the suspect starts walking towards me, with no compliance I setup to deploy my taser. Right before I deploy I look out of the corner of my eye expecting to see my partner. Instead I see nothing. In my head I'm thinking holy shit if I tase this guy and it doesn't effect him he's going to beat my ass. Those 2 seconds felt like a life time. I'm still verbally shouting commands which he's not complying with. I then place my finger on the trigger to my taser, starting to apply pressure when I hear the sound of a door slamming open then a voice bellows STATE POLICE EVERYONE ON THE FUCKING GROUND. Back up was there he quickly posted up behind me with lethal coverage.\n\nFinally the suspect complies and is detained. This entire ordeal lasted what felt like hours, checking the CAD notes the entire thing was over in less then 5 minutes.\n\nTurns out my partner had left me to cover a secondary door to the bedroom, and Didn't return when he heard me make contact.

I was really unsure of what to do at this point so I grabbed my license, and insurance, and registration and got out of the car. The cop was doing the same\n\nMe: Hello Officer\n\nOfficer: Hello, I'm really sorry\n\nMe: Its cool, I'm sure it will be dealt with\n\nOfficer: yea this is my first time\n\nMe: Yea me too\n\nOfficer: Accident?\n\nMe: Nah, was involved in a minor fender bender before but it wasn't a cop that hit me\n\nOfficer: (frowns) yea...well\n\nMe: So what do we do now?\n\nOfficer: Well I need to call back up,\n\nMe: Really?\n\nOfficer: yea I can't be the reporting officer on this one since I'm at fault for the accident\n\nMe: Yea makes sense\n\nOfficer: Would you get back into your car and wait?\n\nMe: Yea sure no problem\n\nGet back in the car, and I start laughing to myself my dad is going get a kick out of this one (the days before cell phones got popular)\n\nA few minutes pass and the first cop car pulls up, this is in quick session followed up by an additional 6 cars. I get asked to come to the side of the road and here is me a 16 yr old teenager surrounded by 8 cops. They ask me about the accident, they ask me if I want to go the hospital (I don't, I wasn't hurt and the accident was very low speed (i want to say less then 10 MPH) and then they ask me if I was have any questions\n\nI look at all 8 cops, including the one who hit me and I said\n\n\"Is it a slow night for you guys?\"\n\nOne cop says \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I find it kind of funny that 7 cops show up to the scene of a fender bender\"\n\nThey all burst out laughing, we go about our business I tell my dad about the accident he laughs about it too.\n\nThe police had me take my car to a local shop for a repair estimate. I was told it would cost around $1,500 to fix. I asked if they would do a cash payout the chief of police called me (well my dad) and asked if $1,000 was enough to settle the matter and he said it was. They gave us $1,000 (vehicle was a old POS...we sold it 3 months later for $500)",

        "text": "First off: OSI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Office_of_Special_Investigations\n\nBasically special police for the Air Force\n\nI was an Air Force brat, and a dual citizen (German/American)\n\nNow an important thing to remember in this story is I understand the SOFA regulations and amount of authority an OSI agent has off base in a foreign country...which is basically whatever the local police decide which is basically zero.\n\nHowever I guess they have an office in Amsterdam that looks out for US Service Members who go up to partake in the coffee shop culture. \n\nSo I go up there at 18 yrs old, I'm a dependent (I still fall under SOFA) and I'm in a coffee shop smoking. My friend and I are being a bit dumb and we mentioned a few things about Ramstein. I also looked like a military guy with my haircut. \n\nWell we left the establishment and right as we walked outside 2 men with military hair cuts approached my friend and I and said they needed to see ID.\n\nOfficer: I need to see some ID\n\nMe: who are you?\n\nOfficer: I need to see some Military ID\n\nMe: Again, who are you?\n\nOfficer: I'm with OSI and I need to see your military ID\n\nMe: Go get fucked\n\nOfficer: Excuse me?\n\nMe: Go get fucked, you have no right to ask me for my ID your badge is worthless off base and you know that\n\nOfficer: I will grab the local police who can demand to see your ID\n\nMe: You are correct, now go grab a dutch police officer and when he asks me for my ID i'll show him\n\nOfficer: Alright\n\nSteps back, makes a phone call\n\nOfficer: You really are making this difficult for yourself and I'm sure your CoC won't be pleased when they find out about this\n\nMe: You really are a dick aren't you?\n\nOfficer: Once we get you back to the base you will be punished\n\nDutch police officer: (Dutch and German is VERY similar and I can understand a good percentage of dutch) Hello\n\nMe: (speaking german) Hello, do you speak German?\n\nDutch: Yes I do what seems to be the problem\n\nMe: (as I look at the OSI officers face in disbelief) Those two American cops from the base are harrassing us wanting to see our IDs, I just came up here to relax not be hassled by American cops who shouldn't be stopping two young tourists in Amsterdam\n\nDutch cop: I see, one moment\n\nDutch talk to OSI, asks them whats up basically they want to see ID. OSI claims I'm a member of the military and he needs to see my military ID so he can collect my details and start my criminal case back on the base.\n\nDutch: Are you American?\n\nMe: No I'm German\n\nDutch: Can I see your ID?\n\nMe: Sure no problem (pull out my German ID, I was over 18)\n\nDutch: I see, well i'm sorry that those men caused you so much frustration, I really don't like it when they come brother our tourists, you guys can go about your business\n\nWe snicker, I say good bye to OSI they are dumb founded. I hear the Dutch police scolding them (in english) and telling them they need stop being police when they have no authority to be police and that if they keep on harassing tourists they will be arrested.\n\nEdit* I don't hate cops, and I was very polite and coordinal with the Dutch police in this manner I however did not like being bothered by a cop who has no authority in the district in which he is operating and that rubbed me the wrong way. Especially when the crime I'm committing in this case (although if you research the issue is a legal grey are) is tolerated in this district (Amsterdam)\n\nAs someone with experience in military communities what put me off a lot about how this OSI agent acted was he did not act in conjunction with the local police force. You see when military police operating in a foreign country (such as Germany) off base they operate with the blessing and cooperation of the local police. ",

        "text": "A cold wind gusted through the parking lot we were gathered in, whipping dead leaves and dust against my bare arms.\n\n“Jesus, EMR, you’re not going to wear a jacket?” Kenny asked from the other side of our powwow. \n\n“Nah, cold’s just a mental thing.” I wiped my nose nonchalantly and hoped the bad lighting hid my shivers from the group. I had, in reality, forgotten my coat back at the office, but I wasn’t about to give this pack of wolves any more fodder for jokes. \n\n“Well then, you’re the ring leader here, let’s get this thing started, huh?” \n\nI cleared my throat and pulled a full page mug shot from my file. “This is Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith likes methamphetamine. He also likes guns. Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, he also has warrants out for distributing crack. We are going to go get Mr. Smith.” I passed the mug shot around for everyone to review. “I’m working this as a favor for Detective Burns in narcotics. He should be here at some point. He’s the one who conducted the last buy with Smith and the warrants are his.” As I finished, a black Escalade careened into the parking lot. Burns jumped out and trotted over.\n\n“Sorry I’m late!” He was breathless and looking for a familiar face in the crowd, finally alighting on mine. \n\n“No biggie, we were just getting started. You have anything to add about this guy?”\n\n“Oh, yeah. Last time I bought off him, he had a Glock in his waist band.” He said it as if it was no big deal and started patting his pockets, looking for something. The rest of us shot nervous glances at each other. \n\n“Well, that ups the ante a little.” I added, breaking up the concerned murmurs. “I guess we’ll approach from this parking lot,” I tapped away on the iPad with the overhead map of Smith’s house. “Stack up here and we’ll approach the door once the back yard is contained. Questions?”\n\n“Yeah, one. Anyone have a baklava?” Burns asked the group and the response was more slightly confused glances.  The silence hung a moment before Kenny spoke up.\n\n“I… I have some tres leches cake. You… want… that?” He seemed to realize the absurdity of the question as he asked. \n\n“Tres what? No, a baklava. Y’know, like a… BAKLAVA! I don’t know how to describe it.” He made a pulling motion on either side of his head.\n\n“Oooooh, a *balaklava*. Like the mask?” One of the guys puzzled together. \n\n“Yeah, a baklava. You got one?” Burns looked for a handout while I stifled a laugh. Someone reached into a vest pocket and threw him a mask. “Thanks, bro, I’ll get it back to you.”\n\nWe drove the couple blocks to the parking lot and filed out of our cars. “The place was dark when we drove by, nothing saying he’s home.” I told the group as we started stalking towards the house. Two guys peeled off the line and hopped a fence to take posts in the back while we waited out of site of the front windows. “Clear back here, you can move.” One of them said over our earpieces. \n\nI took the second spot in the stack, behind our shield man and we climbed the couple steps to the stoop. A jingling sound caught my attention and I looked into the street to see a pudgy bulldog trotting across the street towards us – his under-bite sticking out comically over his tags and buff forelegs barely functioning. The dog came all the way up to the door, my stack just watched in stunned silence. I turned and shrugged to the ones who weren’t covering windows and then leaned in an rapped on the door. \n\nThere was no answer or movement inside that I could tell so I knocked again. The dog scratched at the base of the door. “Good boy” I whispered to him.\n\nSuddenly, the door opened a crack. “Who is it?” a voice emanated from the void. My shield man leaned in and turned on the headlights we had equipped, startling the resident, my target, Mr. Smith. \n\n“POLICE WITH A WARRANT!” I yelled as I filed behind the shield guy into the house. Mr. Smith stumbled over something and fell in the landing. The shield operator pinned him to the ground and I brought my gun up, rail light illuminated and looking for a threat as the number three guy cuffed the target. Mr. Smith was stood up and I took his arm as my team cleared the immediate area. \n\n“Shit, man. I got a warrant?” \n\n“Yeah, for drugs or something.” I replied, looking to my team to make sure they were doing ok. \n\n“Damn. I was just about to jerk off, man.” Like an episode of COPS, my arrestee was clothed only in a pair of basketball shorts and slippers. \n\n“That’ll have to wait.” I told him. I called for something more “jail-worthy” and helped him dress.\n\nThe dog came trotting around the corner and stared up at us. \n\n“Will he be ok here alone for a while?” I asked Smith.\n\n“Who?” \n\n“Your dog.” I nodded to the squat pile of canine a few feet from us, a dollop of drool slowly melting from the corner of his frowning mouth.\n\n“That’s your dog.” Smith said to me over his shoulder. \n\n“No it’s not. We don’t have a dog. I thought it was yours? It was scratching at your door.”\n\n“Nah, man. That fucker attacked me when y’all opened my door. I never seen that fat thing in my damn life.” The dog trotted away into the house after the insult. \n\n“Well… you want a dog?” \n\nSmith just blew air out of his nose. The dog came jingling down the hallway towards us from the kitchen as my guys filed out the front door. \n\n“C’mon boy! C’mon!” I pat my leg and made a kissy sound, not sure how best to coax a stubborn bull dog from a fugitive’s home. The dog cocked his head from one side to another but wouldn’t obey. \n\n“I guess I’ll get the pole from my truck?” I asked one of the senior guys on the stoop. \n\n“Meh.” He replied unhelpfully, with a shrug of a shoulders. \n\n“Y’all muthafuckas can’t leave it here! I got a leather couch!” Smith was getting irate. \n\nI sighed and assessed the situation. “Kenny, take this guy, I’ll grab the dog.”\n\nKen grabbed Smith’s other arm and guided him onto the stoop while I approached the dog in as unthreatening a manner as I could while in a fully loaded tactical vest and thigh rig. “C’mon! Let’s go!”\n\nThe dog backed away and I slumped my shoulders in defeat. “Can I get some help?” Ken and Smith were still in the doorway. Smith’s face was crunching into an enraged scowl.\n\n“No. NO. NOOOOOOO!” He yelled.\n\nThe bull dog lifted its leg on a pair of expensive looking Jordans lined up by the closet door.  It then scratched both paws backwards when it finished and, pleased with his job well done, trotted past us and down the stoop stairs. \n\n“Problem solved!” I exclaimed!\n",

        "text": "Been enjoying your stories. Some of it is really heavy shit, though. Here's something funny that happened to me.\n\nWhen I was 16 or 17 I drove a '65 Chevy Fleetside pickup, it had a straight six and three on the tree. No speeding in this truck, you were lucky to get 55 downhill. My father didn't agree that it needed a supercharged V-8, even though I thought that would be tits. Anyhow we had stripped it down to the frame and rebuilt it.\n\nIt was sound, safety wise. Totally redid brakes. Body and paint were cherry again. Just needed some finishing up, but was my daily driver to school and my job at a farm.\n\nOne summer afternoon I was on my way home after working at the farm all day. I was driving along with the crappy radio playing, the speaker was mounted to the firewall by the magnet. All the sudden I see bluelights in my rearview and a siren blurts at me. I've never been pulled over before, and my adrenaline spikes. I know I wasn't speeding, cause I was going uphill, it just isn't possible.\n\nPulling over, I wait in the cab like I've been told to do. I'm sweating bullets, even though I don't have any idea what I've done. Get my license out. The officer walks up to my truck, silver haired and thin and tall sort of guy. He says, \"Roll down your window.\"\n\n\"Sorry Sir, I can't do that. This window won't roll down.\"\n\n\"Open your door.\"\n\n\"Sorry Sir, I can't do that. This door only opens from the outside. Could you please do it?\"\n\nI'm really nervous now, this is not going well. He opens the door, looks in the cab. I hand him my license. I'm just sitting there, no shirt, straw hat, jeans and boots. Looking like the worlds biggest redneck. \n\n\"How do you get out?\"\n\n\"The other door opens from the inside, I just crawl through.\"\n\n\"Where are you coming from?\"\n\n\"Work. I work at the tater farm behind the hospital.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Home.\"\n\n\"Well, the reason I pulled you over is because you don't have a tag.\"\n\nI look over and the tag I had duct taped to the back glass is missing.\n\n\"Ohhh. It fell off, let me find it.\"\n\nI dig around in the floorboard and under fast food bags, candy wrappers and such, I find it. Duct tape still on it. There's an empty cheesy poof bag stuck to the duct tape on the tag. I hand the whole thing to the cop.\n\nAt this point, he snorts, his shoulders bob a few times and he works hard to kill a grin.\n\n\"Wait here.\"\n\nHe takes my license, tag and cheesy poof assembly back to his cruiser.\n\nIn a minute he returns, and hands me back my license, tag and cheesy poof bag.\n\n\"Please get your tag fixed, have a nice day.\"\n\nI stick the tag back up minus the bag and I'm so glad I didn't get a ticket or arrested or something. I looked like the biggest idiot in the world but I'm sure his coworkers must have gotten a pretty good laugh out of this.",

        "text": "I was 22 and working at a cafe/bar. My coworkers and I were closing up shop while some of us (including myself) drank a beer, as it wasn't unusual to have a beer while cleaning up if we wanted. Around 1AM it was time to leave, but I hadn't finished my beer. Not wanting to waste it, I poured it into a coffee cup to transport it home. It was a dumb idea considering that I was driving home, and although I was not even buzzed, having an open container in your car is *not worth the risk*. What can I say, I was a moron.\n\nBefore we leave (I was driving a few coworkers home,) we smoked some marijuana. I was pretty high, but driving very carefully and as mindfully as possible, all the while my beer was in a lidded coffee cup in the cup holder. Well, suddenly there are blue lights flashing in my rear view mirror. I was shocked because I was sure I was driving fine (in hindsight, maybe I was driving *too* cautiously). Luckily, I realized that one of my taillights was out, and assumed that that was the reason I was pulled over. I opened the window, and the officer said, \"do you know why I pulled you over?\" to which I replied in my quite high state, \"I'm guessing it's because one of the taillights is out.\" I answered him politely and without missing a beat. He confirmed that I was correct, took my license, and went to his vehicle for a moment. Now I'll note that I was driving my girlfriend's car which had a bumper sticker which read, \"Question Authority\". Upon returning to my vehicle, the officer asked, \"do you have any questions for me?\" I told him that I wasn't sure what he meant, and he promptly referred to the bumper sticker (probably testing me, maybe just a joke.) I'm honestly not sure why I didn't shit my pants at this point, and I simply replied, \"Oh. That's just an encouragement to think for yourself.\" He chuckled, said he liked my response, and told me I could go.\n\nI can't believe that I didn't say or do anything particularly stupid during this stop, considering how nervous I was inside. Looking back, I wonder if the officer could smell marijuana, if he perceived me as high, or if I came off as calm and collected as I feel like I did. I also wonder how it would have changed my life if I were caught with that open container. All speculation aside, if anything is certain, it's that I was a 22 year old moron!",

        "text": "Sunday morning arrived far too early. My two year old daughter climbed into bed and I did my best to ignore her failed attempts to whisper her good-mornings to my wife. I felt a hand on my shoulder while I tried to bury my head a little deeper into my pillow. \n\n“You sleep, I’m already awake.” Had I mentioned my wife was a saint? \n\nAbout an hour and a half and a cup of coffee later, and my wife and two sons were heading out the door for church. I held my daughter and waved goodbye from the door and reminded her we would see them again soon when we met them after the service to volunteer some time in a family friendly activity. The morning passed quickly with minimal amounts of whining (some from me, most from her) and before I knew it, we were walking into the church’s main entrance. My boys sprinted to greet me and I asked my wife what my task was. \n\n“Go help grab the boxes with donations from the pastor’s office.” I like manual labor so was happy to oblige. \n\nSeveral trips later, we had spread out several filled-to-the-brim packing boxes with various toiletries. Other families had joined us and our de-facto group leader piped up.\n\n“Ok! I’ll tape signs to these boxes,” several boxes were lined up on folding tables, “Indicating what needs to go where. The older kids who can read can start us out and everyone else join in when you figure it out.” The kids happily unboxed toothpaste and tissues and hand sanitizer and sorted them into the respective receptacles. \n\n“So, does the church do this every year?” My wife asked the group leader as we stood off to the side. \n\n“As long as I’ve been coming here, we’ve hosted the rotating homeless shelter at least one week every year. The parishioners know they can donate materials throughout the year so we always have nice care packages ready for our guests.” \n\nI listened in on the conversation but didn’t add anything, instead pretending to focus on the tornado of child activity. I was mulling over in my head all the calls for service I had responded to in which hospitality blindly handed out to the homeless came back to bite the donor in unexpected ways. I was happy to help the community, but worried this little slice of my personal life might have some negativity introduced to it. I shook off the feeling without voicing it and yelled at my oldest to stop wrapping packing tape around my giggling middle son. \n\n______________\n“New case!” I was shaken from browsing the internet and my coffee mug by my boss’s abrupt delivery of my case packet. “Fresh warrants, detective just got them after a DNA return.” \n\nHe moved on to dole out more work to others while I perused the information presented to me: “Older white male, ties to a motorcycle gang, some penitentiary time on his back, long history of violence… and the current charges? The copies of the warrants are always in the back… Sexual Assault of a Minor, classy!”\n\nI opened my various databases to start developing a more in depth profile. There were lots of older entries and some clear ties to the community and family in the area. It was the perfect jumping off point and I headed out to start some interviews. \n\nBy the third day in, the wind had exited my sails. The case looked to be stagnant and more had been delivered by my boss in the mean time. I realized the target was now homeless, hadn’t been seen by his family for months, and probably had purposefully cut ties with no intention of reuniting with anyone. In short, he was a ghost. I’d put the case in limbo and reassess whenever time permitted.\n\nThe next day was my evening shift which meant I would be flying solo for several hours. The quiet office environment was perfect for catching up on paperwork, and I was feeling the weight of several cases I had closed but had neglected to document. After several hours of wrestling with our dilapidated data entry system, I needed some mental stimulus. At random, I pulled a file from my stack of in-actives and recognized the large, bald man in the mug-shot in the first page as my homeless biker pedophile. Since I already had my records system open, I figured I’d bounce his name off it again, just to see if anything new had cropped up over the past few days. The return caught me by surprise: a new entry said he had been kicked out of a homeless shelter the day before for fighting. The officer who took the report noted that, due to the cold temperatures, my target had been transported to another shelter – one of the temporary ones that shuffled from churches and community centers in my jurisdiction. My spider sense was tingling.\n\nI called up my buddy, George, who was newly assigned to the K9 unit. George was one of my best friends from working patrol and I made an effort to keep up with him whenever our schedules allowed. \n\n“Georgey! You busy? I might have a caper.”\n\n“I’m free! Wait: this doesn’t involve stolen eggs or crapping in trash cans, does it?” My reputation was inescapable. \n\n“No, no. This is a warrant thing. I might have a bead on a pedophile.” I scoffed, incredulous to George’s assumptions my career revolved around the scatological theme. \n\n“Ok. I’m leaving the kennel now, where should we meet?”\n\nAn hour later, dusk had fallen and I was parked outside my usual Sunday haunt. George pulled up and rolled down his window. “I guess you can cover the main entrance in case dude tries to squeeze out. I’m not even sure this is the right shelter, just a hunch.” I knew better than to try and gather information about shelter residents over the phone but was surprised by the lack of cooperation provided when I was just querying the whereabouts of the current traveling shelters. If I hadn’t had personal knowledge of this one, the bleeding heart cop-hater who answered the phone at the services coordination office would have gladly stymied my investigation.\n\n“Cool.” George sniffed the air. “Jesus, are they hot-boxing every car in this parking lot?” Burnt marijuana odors wafted through the air and a few curious faces popped up from between cars and behind trees. I sighed as I thought about the clientele taking advantage of my sanctuary’s hospitality but shook off the urge to be overly cynical. “I’m leaving the dog in the car. He’ll go nuts if I let him out – too much odor stimulation.” \n\n“You’re the expert. I’m just going to throw on my pancake holster and grab a pair of cuffs. Better to go in low key, right?” \n\nGeorge scanned the parking lot and I saw his eyes rest on a guy who was attempting to take a clandestine swig from a cheap bottle of liquor. “Yeah, I’d think so.”\n\nI parked away from the front door and made the long approach on foot. Inside, I saw a couple faces familiar from Sundays. They glanced at me but didn’t flash any recognition – apparently my grubby jeans and t-shirt under my zip up hoody were far enough removed from my Sunday best to make me blend into the current crowd. I approached the woman at the check-in counter and greeted her. “Hey, how are you?”\n\nShe smiled and said she was fine. “Are you a walk-in or on the list?” \n\n“Um,” I fumbled for my wallet and flipped it open to reveal my badge and credentials, “Actually I’m here on business. Is there a program manager around?”\n\nThe look of surprise quickly faded and she recovered with, “Oh, no, not really. I guess Bill is the closest to a boss around here.” She pointed to a rotund man sitting in a folding chair and resting his hands on a battered Steven King paperback. “Bill!” She called.\n\nI introduced and identified myself to Bill and spelled out my purpose for visiting. “Well, that name does sound familiar.” He dismissed the woman who had been eavesdropping from her position and flipped through the booklet of registered guests. “Let’s see… Ah, yes, here he is! He checked in about an hour ago!” He rotated the paper for me to see and I noted the sloppy signature next to my target’s name on the ledger. \n\n“Wow! I didn’t think this would be so easy. Can I have a second to arrange for a few more guys to get here?” Bill agreed and I stepped into a hallway before dialing George to update him. “Dude, he’s here. Looks like they’re only using the front entrance but I think we should a couple more uniforms down here to make it official in case he has some fight in him.”\n\n“Totally, I’m on it.” George replied. \n\nI peeked out from the hallway and saw Bill waddle towards a group of men waiting in line for food. He pointed in my direction and smiled when our eyes met. I ducked back out of view immediately. He was diming me out! \n\nA door opened on the far side of the hall, away from the entrance and I saw the woman from the front desk coming through. “He’s right here!” She called behind her.\n\nMy target lurched into view. He was wearing paisley pajama paints and a wife beater, the tattoos on his jail chiseled biceps and shoulders on proud display. He scowled in my direction but continued towards me. \n\nI pulled out my phone and dialed George again. By the third ring I realized he was probably too consumed with getting backup started to realize the urgency of my call. \n\n“What’s goin’ on?” A gravelly voice demanded from my side. The woman stood beaming next to her charge, my target. \n\n“I found him!” She chirped. \n\n“Uh, thanks?” I looked to the guy. “So, having a good stay?”\n\n“Why are you looking for me?” He asked again, his face squinting with some negative emotion. \n\n“Well, the thing is, there’s a warrant out for you – no big deal!” Downplay, that was my strategy. “And, rather than you get snatched up from bed or something, I thought I’d do you the service and favor of handling it earlier in the evening and more low key!” Appeal to his want for privacy, that’d work too.\n\n“What’s Cutter wanted for?” Another voice piped up from behind me. I turned to see two of the men from the food line standing with their arms crossed and accusing glares on their brows.\n\n“Cutter?” They answered me with a nod toward the wanted guy. “Oh, well… I can’t divulge the particulars, rights to privacy and all that.” I told my target more than his companions and he nodded in approval. \n\n“S’okay boys. This guy’s alright. If I gotta warrant, I gotta go.” I exhaled a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. The two companion thugs turned and grumbled to each other as they walked away. \n\n“Well, let’s turn around, put your hands behind your back, and we’ll be discreet and all that.” \n\nCutter was surprisingly compliant. I draped his jacket over his head and covered the cuffs before patting him down for weapons and contraband. “So,” He asked over his shoulder, “What is the warrant for now that I think of it.” \n\nI hesitated and stood up, thinking of the best way to phrase ‘you had sex with a child’ and not incite a fight. I looked for inspiration and glanced over Cutter’s shoulder. There, smiling back and thumb-tacked to a corkboard was a three-by-five photo of my beautiful wife and cherubic kids. The board was labeled, “Welcome New Members!” and the picture was taken on a Sunday when I had been suffering the flu. \n\n“I can’t recall at the moment.” I somehow stuttered through. “I’ll look it up again in the car!” Cutter accepted the answer and we made our way out the door. Bill held it for me.\n\n“Thanks for coming by!” He called.\n\n“See you on Sunday!” I answered.\n",

        "text": "So I was told to x-post this here.\n\nOriginal source: https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2z38rv/i_swear_i_left_my_crack_pipe_at_home/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo about 6 years ago I was working for an office supply company. I usually only worked mornings but they needed me to close that night so I stayed.\n\nIt was me (a department manager), a closing manager, a stocker, and a cashier. \n\nRight before closing, my closing manager had told me over the radio that a known shoplifter/return fraud person had entered the store and he wanted me to be on the register. \n\nSo I went to the register and waited while he followed her through the store. She was a fairly large lady and always used the motorized scooter when she came in. \n\nThat night, he followed her through the store just slightly out of view from her. He watched her grab an item off the shelf and put it in her bag which was sitting in the basket of the scooter. She then proceeded to drive up to the register I was standing at. \n\nRight before she got to me, she grabbed a soda. Then she finally made it up to me and pulled the item out of her bag, it was a $60 usb wireless mouse. She begins to tell me she bought the mouse, didn't have a receipt cuz she lost it and wanted to return it for store credit and also buy the soda but separately. In order to process the return without a receipt, I have to use her id but, there is a 3-no receipt return limit. \n\nMy closing manager radios to me, not to allow the return for any reason, even if she reached her limit, which she has. He tells me to stall her while he calls the cops. \n\nSo I do. I slowly start putting in her info and waited until the register prompted me to no allow the transaction. I slowly explain to her that I can't take the mouse back unless she brings in the receipt. At this point she leaves the mouse on the counter and tells me to ring up the soda. So I do... slowly again. \n\nRight as I'm finishing the sale, the cops walk in. They begin questioning her about what's going on. She starts saying she didn't do anything wrong. \n\nUnfortunately I can't tell them she was shoplifting because she never put the mouse back into her bag. \n\nShe had intended to leave it there after trying to return it. \n\nMy closing manager finally makes it up to the front of the store and pulls one of the officers away and starts telling them what happened. \n\nWe notice another lady practically run out of the store (her empty handed accomplice). \n\nThe officer in front of me then tells me to go lock the door and make sure no one else comes in since it is now after closing. \n\nSo I go lock the door and meet the rest of my coworkers just to the left of the doors so we can watch whats going on. \n\nAs we're standing there waiting for the cops to resolve the situation, the lady starts screaming that she wants to leave and that she didn't do anything wrong. After screaming at the officers for 10mins, she literally jumps out of the scooter and starts trying to run towards the door. \n\nThe officer then screams at me to go stand in front of the door and to keep it locked. \n\nOur store had a double door, an outer front door that was automatic and then an inner door that was automatic... it was a very small hallway between both doors. \n\nSo here I am at the outer door with with my hand on the lock blocking the exit. The lady comes rushing at me and begins screaming at me in a loud shrill voice. The sound is literally echoing in this little hallway between the doors. \n\nThe lady proceeds to threaten to assault me if I don't let her out. The male officer is now behind her screaming that she needs to return inside to the main part of the store or he'll be forced to drag her back in. \n\n5 mins of screaming later... Right before she has the opportunity to assault me, he tackles her... keep in mind, she's a bigger lady... and well when the officer tackled her, she sort of bounced. \n\nIn the mist of things I had to dive off to the side to avoid being tackled or kicked. \n\nAfter the officer finally has her in cuffs, he picked her up and brought her back in the main part of the store. \n\nThe female officer proceeds to search through her bag and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. The female officer then pulls the male officer off to the side and begins to talk to him. The male officer then takes the pack and brings it to where me and my closing manager are now standing and opens the pack and asks my manager if he knew what she had. \n\nI was still trying to regain my hearing and didn't catch what was said. \n\nMy closing manager is trying so hard at this point not to bust out laughing and turns to me and goes \"Did you see that? The woman has a crack pipe in her cigarette pack.\" \n\nNot even 2 secs later we hear the officer asking the woman why she had a crack pipe. The whole time she denies it but at this point she's already being arrested. \n\nAs they finally start taking her outside to put her in the back of the car, she starts screaming \"OFFICER, I TOLD YOU IT'S NOT MY CRACK PIPE, I LEFT MINE AT HOME!!!\" \n\nWe all start dying of laughter at that point. \n\nIn the midst of realizing what she said, the woman starts faking a heart attack. \n\nWe had to wait for paramedics to arrive and fill out statements about what we saw and heard. \n\nTill this day I'll never forget that story. Turns out... this woman lives not even 3 miles away from me in a trailer park.",

        "text": "Ken gave a little cough that caused the group to quiet their jokes and gossip.\n\n“This one could go south. Mr. Thomas has warrants out for felony assault, possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, sales of a schedule one narcotic, assault on police, and manufacturing a controlled substance. They tried to grab him yesterday over in Townsville but he was able to fight his way through their rear perimeter, literally, and it looks like he ended up meeting with his girlfriend. We tracked her credit cards and that brings us here: the Comfort Inn. Her car is in the parking lot and she also has warrants for assault and absconding. We’re not sure which room they are in so we’ll need to do some digging. I’ll go inside and talk to management but not until it’s our last option in case they’re not cop-friendly.”\n\n“I’ll set up in that bank parking lot across the street. I should have a good view with my binos.” I chirped up, wanting to get a good position and be in the thick of it if it hit the fan. \n\n“Cool, thanks. I think we need another one or two to cover all the entrances and everyone else can go tuck away out of sight until we get word. I’ll email pictures and vital stats.” Ken dismissed the group and I loaded up into my unmarked car. It had taken a while to get in to the groove of high risk warrant services but once I got the hang of it, I knew why it had been such a hard job to land. \n\nThe motel and bank were in a fairly rough part of town and as soon as I parked I began ticking off the minor infractions going on around me that, had I still been in patrol and not working plainclothes, I would have busied myself with: Guy drinking from a forty-ounce bottle in public? Check. Another peeing behind a parked car? Check. Was that a hand-to-hand? Probably. Oh look! A hooker! I was so intrigued with my misdemeanor voyeurism that I failed to notice the security guard approach my window. His knock startled me enough to cause me to spill my coffee in my lap.\n\n“Whoa! You scared me buddy! What’s up?” I rolled down my window and smiled at the portly gentleman. \n\n“Move outa here.” He demanded, flippantly. \n\n“Huh?” \n\n“I said, get out of my lot you perv.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I think you’re confused. Perv?”\n\n“Oh, I ain’t confused. You’re ‘bout to get a can of whoop-ass poured aaaaaall over you!” He stepped back and balled his hammy fists at his side. I was amused. \n\n“Oh, you think I’m trolling for hookers?” The thought finally dawned on me. \n\n“And you need to get out of my lot!” He was starting to rock and pursed his lips angrily. \n\nI held up my ID and made an embarrassed grimace, hoping to calm the behemoth. He studied it for a second, looked at me, then studied the ID again before addressing me. “I don’t care if you’re a cop, trying to pick up hoes in my lot ain’t gonna fly!” His agitation level had dropped but he was still missing the point. \n\n“I’m not picking up hookers. I’m looking for a wanted guy.” The statement reminded me why I was in the lot and I glanced back at the motel just in time to see one of the doors swing to a close. I had missed the person passing through it. \n\n“Oh, alright then. M’bad.” Hammy was all smiles now. His transformation from “attempt to intimidate” to “I’m your buddy” was impressive. “We gotta be hard out here, these homeless mutha fuckas will walk all over you if you let ‘em, y’know.” \n\n“Yeah man, totally.” I was concerned our back and forth had prevented me from seeing something important so my attention was still trained on the motel. It didn’t slow down Hammy.\n\n“So, uh… you got any contacts up in hiring? I’ve been trying to get over with y’all for, like, years.” He was gushing. \n\n“Yeah, sure. Let me get your card and I’ll pass it along.” I still didn’t remove my eyes from the building but put out my hand to receive his card. \n\n“Nice, man! Here. That’s not my cell though, I had to change that shit when bae went nuts. Women, right?” He placed a slightly sweat-dampened card in my awaiting palm and backed away. “I got you, by the way. Ain’t no one gonna walk up on you. Undercover and shit… shit’s on fire, yo!” He almost yelled the last part and walked away, smiling and nodding back at me before turning thug mode back on and scowling at a passing potential gang member. I put his card in my cup holder and trained my binoculars back on one of the rooms. \n\nKen came across the radio a few minutes later, advising he was going to give the management a shot. \n\nAnother few minutes passed and he came back over the air. “Room 207. Her name is on the room.”\n\nWe started to creep into the lot, one car at a time, and I threw my vest and thigh rig on while still sitting in the driver’s seat. When all of us were parked and Ken gave the word, I exited my car and darted under the awning, obscuring myself from the upper level windows and waiting for the rest of the team to line up with me. I glanced across the street and saw Hammy, looking at us with far too much interest and throwing me a thumbs-up when he noticed my glare. \n\nOnce our line was set, Ken took the lead and we silently made our way to the room. A door cracked open and a cloud of marijuana smoke poured out into the hallway. We just kept walking by the wide eyed occupant and I noted the sound of the chain lock being thrown behind me. \n\nWe finally arrived at 207 and paused to listen for any sounds coming from inside. It was clear the TV was on, so the room was most likely occupied, but outside of that, there was no further indication. \n\nIn those seconds leading up to entry, one’s mind tends to run through things that could happen. I adjusted my grip on my firearm while thinking, ‘check the hands, make demands, assess for other threats’, my mantra to ease my mind a bit. I then started to wonder if we were walking into an ambush. Surely, the target had to know we tracked him to his girlfriend’s place. Coming here was a good way to throw us but wouldn’t assuredly do so. Was he on edge, waiting with a gun by his side? Or was he tired of running and ready to point the TV remote at us and force our hand? Ken’s knock shook me from my daydreams and I tensed as a male’s voice called out, “Who is it?”\n\n“Police!” Ken replied. \n\nA female yelled, “Oh shit!” and we heard scrambling inside. Ken pulled out the key the manager had given him and swiped it. It worked on the second try and he opened the door to the point the chain lock caught.\n\n“Ram up!”\n\nAnother team member rushed in and swung the ram at the door, close to the chain. The door blew open on the second swing and we entered, all of yelling our various commands: “Show us your hands!”, “Don’t move!”, “Police with a warrant!”\n\nThe male vaulted the bed and the woman began screaming and darting in the same direction. Ken threw his forearm into her and drove her out of the way as the number two man in line filed toward the male, giving more commands and demanding he keep his hands raised, gun-light trained on him and blinding him. \n\nKen collapsed on the woman, pinning her to the bed and I filed behind him in case she fought. The rest of the team quickly cleared the room and cuffed the male. \n\n“What’s your name?” one of us asked the male.\n\n“Terrence. What paper do I got?” The man replied. I looked down at Ken who was just then rising off the woman. A look of confusion was on his face and it doubled when he looked at the man – not only was he not the target, but the male hadn’t had time to fully dress before we barged in. His manhood swayed in the breeze right at Ken’s eye level on the other side of the filthy bed. \n\nI noticed the lack of clothing as well when another thought dawned on me.\n\n“Uh, Ken?” \n\n“Yeah?” His voice was low, tense with anxiety. \n\n“You want to  get off her… and let her put on some… pants?” \n\nKen bit his lip and started to look down but thought better of it halfway to her waist. He eased himself up and coughed as he straightened his shirt under his raid vest. “Yeah. Good idea.” He found something interesting to inspect on the ceiling and I quickly found a pair of yoga pants to give the woman, now shaking her head and muttering to herself. \n\n“Why’d you all bust in here?” She asked once she squeezed into the pants.\n\n“You’ve got warrants. I’ll need to talk to you outside, whenever you’re ready.” The red hue on Ken’s cheeks was just then beginning to fade. \n\nWe ran a NCIC check on the male and he came back clean. We removed the cuffs and let him get dressed but he didn’t seem to phased by the whole situation. \n\n“Shit, man. If you all had been here ten minutes ago, you would’ve seen me like your boy over there: balls deep up in my girl!” He laughed and I joined him along with another guy who had stayed behind. Ken pretended not to hear us on the other side of the room. “She three months pregnant too, so you can bust one off up in there, ifyouknowwhatImean!” Ken made a quick glance at his waist region, I assume to make sure we wouldn’t need crime scene to come out to recover any stray DNA. \n\n“Baby, I got warrants.” The girl called from the other side of the room. “Bail me out later, ok?” \n\n“You got warrants? Oh man, it’s never me who gets to walk from these things. I’ve always got paper out on me.” He was amazed.\n\n“We checked and double checked. You’re clean.” I told him. \n\n“Shit, girl! If I had known you were inviting all these other dudes to grind up on your shit, I would’ve said no!” He chuckled to himself and gathered his things. “Gentlemen!” He said as way of departing words. \n\n“Baby! Call me!” The arrested called after him. \n\nIt turns out the girl had met up with our target the day before but knew he was wanted by everyone with a badge on this side of the Mississippi. She took him to a bus stop but kicked him out, knowing she was going to turn the heat up on herself by staying close. The guy in the room was a side-guy, not the father of her child (but then, she wasn’t sure who was), but someone she routinely rented hotel rooms with. Word got out that we locked her up and later that night he turned himself in. \n\nThe box of condoms that showed up on Ken’s desk the next morning is still a mystery. \n",

        "text": "After my [previous tale](http://redd.it/2ympnu), I mentioned that I had one more that would suit Tales From The Squad Car... For those that have not yet read the previous story, I was not your typical law enforcement officer - I was a proud member of Her Majesty's Royal New Zealand Navy.\n\nOn this particular evening, I was on duty in the Naval Base. This consists of being the first response team for anything out of the ordinary - for example, a fire, or a vehicle collision (in nine years of service, I only had to attend one accident - motorcycle vs steel post, primarily caused by alcohol and speed). The truth is that it was usually limited to the occasional rowdy drunk. So normally nothing much happens, and the only thing that you're required to do is take the flag down at sundown, raise the flag at 0800, and the evening cleaning inspection.\n\nMurphy clearly had other plans for this evening.\n\nI was the duty Senior Rate, and as such was looking forward to an evening of doing SFA. Unfortunately, Krod was the duty officer of the day, and he had plans on shifting the majority of his workload on to me. Krod had been given his nickname years earlier; it was DORK spelled backwards. However, when he asked what \"Krod\" meant, a quick witted person told him it was \"the son of Conan The Barbarian\". He swallowed this story, hook, line and sinker, and his name was Krod for about five years before someone let slip the true origin of the name.\n\nWe didn't get to call him Krod to his face after that anymore.\n\nI was working in the same building as Krod, and due to his administrative position, he liked to dump as much work as he could on me, despite me not actually reporting to him in any manner. But unfortunately, for this duty, I was his 2IC, so I was at his beck and call.\n\nKrod had me run Sunset (the flag taking down ceremony),  the evening cleaning inspection around the base's living areas, and I was finally settling in for a nice pleasant evening with my PS2, when I was once more called to Krod's presence.\n\nJoy.\n\n&gt; KROD: Gambatte! I need you to head over to the Training Establishment, there's been some sort of problem and the Duty Leading Hand (DLH) can't handle it.\n\n&gt; ME: Who's the DLH?\n\n&gt; KROD: Susan.\n\nOh FFS, not Susan. Susan was the woman I described as the \"CEO's junior secretary\" [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22dkrb/encyclop%C3%A6dia_moronica_f_is_for_faults_can_save), which is an obfuscated version of \"Captain's personal steward\". In the time since that story, her provisional promotion had been made permanent, meaning she had somehow passed the promotion course.\n\nIn my personal opinion, Susan couldn't lead ants to a picnic if she was made of sugar.\n\n&gt; ME: Right, I'll grab one of the duty watch to drop me off at the Training Establishment, I'll sort out what's going on, and then I'll call with the details. Worst case scenario; prep a cell in the brig.\n\nAs the brig was currently unoccupied, this consisted of turning on the lights and finding a pillow.\n\n&gt; KROD: You can't take the duty vehicle; you'll have to walk.\n\n&gt; ME: It's a five minute round trip by car, but it'll take me... You know what, forget it.\n\nDid I mention that Krod liked to keep the things he shouldn't have worried about tightly under his own control, and the stuff he was meant to personally be taking care of would be shoveled onto whatever subordinate he could find? Those of us with the misfortune to have to deal with him referred to it as \"ruling with a fist of ham\", and previous experience had taught me (the hard way) that there's no point arguing with him.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, I arrived on foot at the Training Establishment. I promptly found the Duty Instructor's office, where Susan was holed up. There was one female trainee outside the office, sitting on a step by herself. As I approached a male trainee ran up and started talking to her. The female trainee seemed pretty upset, and I witnessed the trainees embrace.\n\n&gt; ??: GET THE F$@K AWAY FROM HER NOW!!\n\nOf course - sitting unsupervised on the step was Susan's idea of isolating the trainee; and the trainees were willfully ignoring her instructions to leave the isolated trainee alone.\n\nGreat.\n\n&gt; ME: Trainee (TX)! Why are you sitting here?\n\nI did read her name of her uniform's name badge, but I don't recall it at the moment, so she'll remain TX for ever more.\n\n&gt; TX: The Leading Hand told me to wait here and not to talk to anyone.\n\n&gt; ME: If any of the other trainees approach you again, tell them to immediately go back to their cabin, or else they will be talking to me instead. Understood?\n\n&gt; TX: Yes, PO.\n\nI suppose I should mention I was a Petty Officer (PO) at the time.\n\nI went inside.\n\n&gt; SUSAN (S): Thank God you're here, Gambatte!\n\n&gt; ME: Just... tell me what happened.\n\nSusan had run the normal routine at the Training Establishment - dinner, Sunset, inspections, lights out - without any issues. However, some of the more senior trainees (which is measured in weeks, so \"senior\" is a very relative term) were permitted leave until midnight. TX was one of them, and had returned drunk. Susan had given her a direct order (as she was legally permitted to do, by virtue of both her rank as a Leading Hand and her duty position). However, while TX had headed into the accommodation, she had not complied. A very loud argument had broken out between TX and another trainee; Susan had attempted to intervene but had only succeeded in escalating the situation to the point where a physical altercation had broken out.\n\nSusan had hit TX, TX had hit Susan, a second trainee may also have been involved... It was a mess.\n\n&gt; ME: Okay Susan... Where's your duty watch?\n\nThe Training Establishment ran their own duty watch in parallel with the base. Mostly it was just who was going to vacuum the floors and help wash dishes in the dining hall, but the duty watch should have been Susan's first point of call to help sort out the situation.\n\n&gt; S: Still in bed. I didn't think it was worth waking them...\n\nSo you'll call for me to sort out your mess, while letting the trainees sleep? That's not how the game works - the most junior person gets woken first.\n\n&gt; ME: Right. Get me at least four members of duty watch - if you're feeling kind, pick the ones that don't have duty assignments first thing in the morning. If you're not, wake the lot - I don't care.\n\n&gt; S: Okay.\n\n&gt; ME: Then go get a cup of coffee or something - I can't have you in the office for this.\n\nOnce the members of duty watch arrived, I put one on each door to the office with instructions to let no one through without notifying me first, sent the third to collect TX, and set the fourth go make sure the rest of the Training Division stayed in the accommodation. Once TX arrived, I sent that duty watch member to periodically check with the ones on the doors, to make sure they had someone to relieve them so they could grab some water, use the toilet, etc.\n\nOnce TX and I were alone, I asked one simple question.\n\n&gt; ME: What happened tonight?\n\nAnd it began. It started as a simple trickle; then the words came faster and faster until the trickle was a stream was a river in full flood.\n\nTX had an abusive mother, so she didn't take well to female authority figures, but she'd kept it in check... Until. Until tonight. Until she'd fallen in love - the kind of love that only an 18 year old can have for another 18 year old that they've only known for a couple of months. The guy was another trainee, and she'd fallen, and fallen hard. She'd been *so sure* that he felt the same way... until she found out that he was sleeping with someone else. Not just someone else, but another female trainee, who slept in the very same room as TX, just a couple of bunks over. And it wasn't just casual sex - he had feelings for the other girl, but TX was just a bit of fun - a friend with benefits, and nothing more.\n\nSo like any reasonable adult, TX had gone out and gotten drunk. Broken-hearted, low-down country-blues drunk. Surprisingly enough, it didn't actually help.\n\nTX had come back to base - and before her leave was up, which was a good start. Unfortunately, she was a noisy drunk, and Susan had stepped in and told her to go sleep it off.\n\nThe dam that had been holding back all her personal issues for months started to crack, just a little bit.\n\nTX got back to her accommodation, and ran into the other girl. A noisy confrontation ensued.\n\nThe crack widened further.\n\nSusan arrived, and attempted to lay down the law.\n\nThe dam burst.\n\nTX had starting mouthing off to Susan, calling her the most horrible names she could think of. Something she said most have got through, because - in TX's version of events, at least - Susan slapped her, hard. Well, then it was all on. Eventually, Susan extricated herself from the fight and disappeared. I assume this is when she managed to call Krod, who dumped the whole damned mess in my lap, because according to TX, Susan returned a few minutes later, shouting that the Officer of the Day was on his way, so they'd better sort their respective sh!t out ASAP, which had penetrated the alcohol fog sufficiently to calm TX down.\n\nReciting this had broken things down completely - TX was weeping openly. However, as I was doing my best to remain impartial, all I could do was offer her tissues from whoever's desk I happened to be sitting at that night.\n\nAnd she had every reason to cry. She had just confessed to disturbing the peace, being drunk and disorderly, failure to follow a lawful order, insubordination, assaulting a fellow trainee, striking a superior officer, and everyone's favorite charge, conduct unbecoming a Naval Rating. As a trainee, any one of these would end her career.\n\nI thought about handling it in house - I really did.\n\nI opened the office door, and spoke to the duty watch member I'd placed there earlier.\n\n&gt; ME: Hey - has anyone come up and tried to get in to see TX?\n\n&gt; DW: Yes PO.\n\n&gt; ME: How many?\n\n&gt; DW: Just one or two people.\n\n&gt; ME: Just one or two... Wait, how many times have these \"one or two\" been here?\n\n&gt; DW: Lots, PO.\n\nFaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaark. Clearly I couldn't leave her there; even though she was now a sad and regretful drunk who just wanted to cry herself to sleep, the disturbance she caused had taken on a life of it's own. The only solution I could see was to pull her out of the Training Establishment, and there was only one place that Krod would let me take her.\n\n*****\n\nKrod actually relented and sent the duty watch vehicle over to pick up TX and I. I then sat with her at the Naval Hospital until she was declared medically fit by the duty Medic to spend the night in the cells, and I walked beside her down that long and lonesome hallway to the cells. I was the last person she saw as the heavy metal door closed, and the lock turned with a KER-CHUNK so cliché you'd have sworn it came from a Hollywood sound studio.\n\nKrod, being the marvellous human being that he was, made us wait until he heard sobbing from inside the cell before we were permitted to leave.\n\n*****\n\nTX was discharged. I don't know what happened to her beyond that.\n\nSusan received no disciplinary or remedial action that I was aware of, although (in my opinion) she could have clearly used some additional training.\n\nThe Duty Senior Rate duty was removed from the base roster, and added to the Training Establishment duty roster, to provide support and assistance to the Training Establishment Duty Leading Hand.\n\nKrod continued to be a generally unpleasant person. Eventually, he was posted to ship and I no longer had to deal with him directly.",

        "text": "This is not your typical Tale From The Squad Car, but it suits this subreddit best, I think. You see, about a decade ago, I was a serving member of the Royal New Zealand Navy. Now, I know what you're thinking: 'Take your sea shanties to /r/talesfromthemilitary, Princess!\" but this isn't about anything that happened on ship. Rather, this tale took place while I was assisting the local police (hence the Officer/Ridealong tag). Let me explain...\n\nThe New Zealand Navy isn't the most gung-ho of military forces in the world; often we'd just turn up in a port and go get drunk without interacting with the local law enforcement at all. But every so often, due to some special circumstance, a few extra sailors would be roped in for duty with the local police, which was called \"Shore Patrol\".  \nShore Patrol was given \"special command\" - legal authority over any of our sailors, regardless of rank outside of Shore Patrol - to aid the local law enforcement with sailors. This meant we'd deal with the drunk, disorderly, or otherwise relatively petty infringement of any local laws by our sailors - and if it was a serious offence, we'd drop the offending sailor under the bus that is local law enforcement until the actual Naval Police could take over. Everyone on the ship knew before they stepped ashore on leave that Shore Patrol would be out and about, so they generally kept themselves in check and would toe the line pretty well.\n\nSo Shore Patrol was normally a snooze-fest. And that's how it should be. And that's how we liked it.\n\n*****\n\nOn this particular occasion, we were on our way home from a nine month deployment around south-east Asia when the ship's schedule was changed - we were stopping at Hobart, for political reasons I don't really remember, if I was ever made privy to them in the first place. But in order to dock there, we were required to provide a Shore Patrol to assist the local police department.  \nDue to the luck of the draw, I pulled the short straw: Shore Patrol, first night in port. If anything was going to go down at all, it was almost invariably on the first night. I would be taking charge as the more senior member of the team, and Jason would be my junior. The real purpose of the junior member of the team was to be the first into any altercations, as attacking the senior member of Shore Patrol technically counted as \"Striking a Superior Officer\" - just one of the joys of special command.  \nJason, however, was all of five foot nothing and only weighed about as much as his clothes and keys. While he was a good guy, I knew that if anything physical started, Jason was not going to be much help. I raised these concerns in advance, of course - not that it made any difference; the roster was set above my pay grade, and someone on high had decided that Jason was doing Shore Patrol, whether he would be useful or not.\n\nI'd also recently had the dubious pleasure of having a young man called Nathan work for me as one of my junior technicians. Nathan's mouth had this bad habit of writing checks his butt couldn't cash, and on more than one occasion I came across his supervisor-of-the-moment on the verge of applying some rudimentary \"percussive education\". It was little wonder that he bounced from supervisor to supervisor; while his work was normally mostly adequate, he'd constantly boast as if he were God's gift to the workplace.  \nSPOILER: He was not. In fact, he was [this guy](http://redd.it/1rodh8) (although that story is obfuscated to keep my workplace anonymous, as per the rules of that subreddit).\n\nSo it was with no great pleasure that I spotted Nathan, loudly laughing and joking with some of the other guys, on the street outside a strip of nightclubs. They'd all clearly been drinking; a little rowdy, but nothing worth acting on. At this stage, it's worth mentioning that it was nearing midnight; I'd been on Shore Patrol with the local officers for about five hours - but Shore Patrol was required to work the full day beforehand, so I'd been working for some sixteen hours straight at this point, after only six or so hours of sleep - I'd been working the 7/5 split all week while at sea (seven hours on watch, seven hours off, five on, five off, repeat *ad nauseam* until we hit port).\n\nAs was my duty, I pointed out the group of sailors to the local officers. The New Zealand Navy isn't a huge place - a couple of thousand people total, and the ships are even smaller, so I knew all of the sailors in the group - by face at least, if not by name. The officers parked the plainly marked police car we were riding in, and we all exited the vehicle. The officers went to do a quick sweep of the bars, while Jason and I did the same dance we'd been doing all night - \"Hey guys, how's it going, having a good night?\" and so on.  Everything seemed normal, so Jason and I waited by the car for the officers to return.\n\nOne of them came back alone (O1).\n\n&gt; O1: *{The other officer}* (O2) will be back in a minute - he's just in the toilet.\n\n&gt; ME: No worries - it's not like we're going anywhere...\n\n&gt; *(From behind me)* ??: Hey Gambatte!\n\nSure enough, it was Nathan (N). He'd split off from the group for some reason to come talk to me.\n\n&gt; N: Hey Gambatte! Busy night?\n\n&gt; ME: Well, no, apart from a couple of guys who tried to steal my hat... They got as far as reaching for it before they realized it was a *really* bad idea.\n\n&gt; N: Civilians, right?\n\n&gt; ME: Yeah. Apart from that, it's been pretty quiet.\n\nAn idiotic grin split Nathan's face.\n\n&gt; N: Well, I can fix that!!!\n\nTime slowed to a crawl.\n\nNathan turned away from me, and with his left hand grabbed a nearby civilian by the shoulder, spinning him towards him. His right arm pulled back, his hand suddenly clenched into a fist floating ominously by his head.\n\nJason was turned away from the situation, chatting to O1, and completely oblivious.\n\nO1 saw the sudden movement and started to react. He managed to widen his eyes and start moving his hands towards his belt - whether he was going for pepper spray or a taser or handcuffs, I'll never know.\n\nThe civilian saw the looming fist and started to flinch away from it.\n\nIn summary: A sailor, in front of two Shore Patrol members and an officer of the local police department - all clearly in uniform and actively on duty - has decided to assault a civilian. I could see the rest of the night going very poorly, very quickly - if that punch went any further.\n\nIn one fluid movement, I stepped in behind Nathan and placed my right foot between his feet. My right arm swung up under his right armpit, allowing me to place my right palm squarely on his chin and lift, rotating his head up; his punch collapsed in on itself as his head moved unexpectedly. Meanwhile, I rotated on my right foot through 180 degrees, transferring the bulk of my weight on to my left foot at the end of the movement.  \nIt was, all told, a fairly well executed hip throw - I think a judoka would have called it an *osoto gari*. I kept control of Nathan's right arm as he fell, preventing him from hitting the ground hard. Well, from hitting it *too* hard.  \nI immediately pulled him back to his feet, before anyone else noticed his sudden horizontal transition. There was no movement from the crowd; no one shouting at me to leave him alone - either no one in the crowd had noticed, or no one who had noticed cared enough to try to intervene.\n\n&gt; ME: *(quietly but oh so very angrily)* Get back to ship NOW, Nathan. This is a DIRECT ORDER - if I see you out again tonight, you'll be explaining your actions to the Master *(At Arms; the head of Naval Police on ship)*.\n\n&gt; N: Uh.. Yi... Yeah.\n\nI'm pretty sure Nathan was still trying to figure out which way was up, but he immediately took off into the night, headed in the rough direction of the ship. Total elapsed time: four, maybe five seconds, tops.\n\nTime resumed its normal flow.\n\n&gt; O1: *(to Jason)* DID YOU SEE THAT?!\n\n&gt; J: See what?",

        "text": "During high school, I was in a police program sponsored by the local police department (though not affiliated with the Explorer program). During this time, we had two officers in charge of the program. This is a story about our first officer. She was a tough woman, but most of the kids in our program adored her.\n\nThe local PD was having a graduation, and requested that our program send some students to volunteer to help out with parts of the graduation. We wore our \"Class A\" uniforms, which was the same as the police department's Community Service Officer uniforms, only with \"Dead President H.S.\" Beneath the department patch and no badge.\n\nThe Officer loved her car. It was brand new. It was pristine. She owned it for a week. She decided to take myself and two other students to the event in her vehicle. As we hopped in, she gave out a list of rules: \"This is my new car. Do not put your feet on the seats. Do not touch the windows. DO NOT EVEN BREATHE ON MY CAR.\" We nervously and cautiously entered her vehicle, being careful to not violate her strict rules-- she was a very scary woman when angry.\n\nWe drive out to the event, and get to the last left turn before the event. We can see the building, the huge amount of squad cars present, and there is an officer in the intersection directing traffic. The other kids and I are happily chatting away in the back, when we suddenly jerk forward. My head hits the back of our Officer's seat. I look around, slightly dazed, though not worse for the wear.\n\nThe Officer lets out a series of expletives, and immediately exits the car after checking to make sure we are fine. She goes to the car behind us, which has made an effort to merge its bumper with hers. At this point, her entire head had turned beet red with fury. The officer directing traffic has stopped everything, and several other uniformed officers that were waiting to turn into the graduation ceremony have gotten out of their vehicles to assist. She is now shouting furiously at the person behind the vehicle that hit us-- he was a drunk driver who ran into the person behind us at about 30MPH. He also seemed absolutely mortified to not only see a *very* furious officer in full uniform, but three \"community service officers\" (us) exit the same vehicle, and uniformed officers exit from nearly every other vehicle in the turn lane. I have no idea what possibly could have gone through his mind at that sight, but I was amused by the facial expression he held.\n\nThe scene was handled extremely quickly-- apparently, when you have 20 off-duty officers present at an incident they tend to get things done efficiently. The drunk driver was immediately arrested, tow trucks were called, and we were cleared by the EMTs, who then carted the other driver away, since she was injured when the drunk hit her.\n\nAs our Officer came back to the car, she pointed to the building. \"We're walking the rest of the way.\" She tells us, with no room in her tone for objection, her face still a deep red from her fury. \"And if you say one word about my car, your entire class will spend 2nd period doing push-ups.\" One of my classmates smiles. \"At least *we* weren't the ones to mess up your car!\" he chimes in, ending it with a chuckle.\n\nThe next day, instead of going over the penal code involving property crimes, we spent an hour listening to our Officer shout \"DOWN!\" every 5 seconds while our instructor graded papers. My classmate was shunned for a week-- apparently his joke wasn't as funny as he thought.",

Over my 11 year career, with an additional 3 as a crime scene tech, I’ve seen a lot. When you think you’ve seen it all, you come to work the next day and get surprised again.  Because of that, I usually have to pause for a while to try and remember what specific story I think they’d want to hear.  \n\nWhen it comes to stupid calls, the list is extensive.  There’s the mother who called because her 6 and 8 year old sons were fighting over Pokémon cards.  There’s the lady who called to report feral cats in her home, which turned out to be 2 kittens that were less than a month old.  There’s the guy who called to report that the ducks in the pond behind his home were snoring and keeping him awake (admittedly, that was my top winner for a long time).  But I feel like early last year, a new winner arose to accept the stupidest call I’ve ever been to.\n\nThe call, which was initially reported by a 3rd party, came out as a disorder in a parking lot.  Two men were outside of their vehicles, arguing with each other.  Then, while I was on my way, one of the involved parties called and said that a person was blocking him in.  That’s not too uncommon.  Many people make many bad decisions.  I think blocking someone in is pretty high up there on the bad decision scale.  But I’ve seen it.  Someone takes your parking space (which really brings up the argument, what makes a parking space “yours?”), block em in.  Did someone cut you off, tail gate you, merge in to your lane, or do any other traffic movement that led you to feeling offended?  Follow them until they park, and block them in.  Baby mama drama?  Why not argue loudly outside, and block her in so she can’t leave before you have a chance to fully express how upset you are?  Boss didn’t pay you on time?  Block his car in with yours until he pays you.  It’s sure to work.  But see, what people don’t realize is two things.  The person being “blocked in” isn’t really blocked in.  Because they could get out of their car and walk away.  In fact, the aforementioned boss exited his car, went in to his office, and called the police to report that he was being detained and kidnapped.  The other thing that people frequently forget is that there are millions of guns in the US.  A vast amount of them in my state alone. And the worst thing you can do to someone who is already emotional and angry is to corner them.  It’s much wiser to park elsewhere, note the plate, and call the police.  Or, evaluate the situation in your head, and decide whether it’s really worth your time, effort, and frustration because they merged in front of you.  Or, maybe, just maybe, you could head home to your family, have a glass of wine, and watch the Modern Family marathon.\n\nBut back to my call.  As I’m driving, I’m speculating on the possible options I could be facing on my arrival.  I pull in to the parking lot.  It’s a grocery store parking lot with a L shaped strip mall of the anchor store, and numerous smaller business on each side, along with a gas station on the corner, a free standing auto parts store, and a chain restaurant that serves pancakes of the international variety.  The parking lot is sizable with lanes adjacent to parking stalls, along with the access “roads” that run through the lot to allow ingress and egress.  \n\nFairly close to the center of the lot I see them. A Corvette and a lifted pickup truck.  It’s what is basically a T-shaped intersection in the parking lot.  The wider road (I use the term because I don’t know what the drivey parts of parking lots are called) is running north south, from the public roadway to the front of the storefronts.  The smaller road T’s off of that to the west, and eastbound cars have a Stop sign.  Now, understand that traffic law doesn’t exist on private property (at last in my state or any state I’ve ever heard of).  The only thing we enforce are DUI, Reckless Driving, or Hit and Run.  That’s it.  Stop signs on private lots are merely suggestions.\n\nThe Corvette is on the east/west roadway, facing east, about 15’ back from the Stop sign.  The truck is primarily on the north/south roadway, in the midst of a right turn on to the east/west.  My first assumption is that it was a private property collision, and the drivers both got upset and started arguing.  But as I exit my patrol car, neither seem to have damage. \n\nI contact the first driver of the truck.  He tells me that he’s headed toward the grocery store.  He starts to turn right toward the parking area.  His truck is so large, and the roadway so small, that in order to negotiate the turn he takes up both lanes of traffic of the roadway he’s turning on to.  As he’s turning, the driver of the Corvette comes up from the west, and refuses to yield while he finishes his turn.  He stops, in the eastbound lane, and refuses to back up. I clarify that there was no collision.\n\nI contact the driver of the Corvette.  He tells me that he’s trying to leave the lot.  He is driving eastbound through the parking lot toward the larger road that takes him to the exit.  As he approaches the Stop sign, the driver of the truck comes whipping around the corner and in to his lane.  The driver of the truck refuses to yield to him, and refuses to back up.  I clarify that there was no collision. \n\nIn speaking to them further, I learn that this hadn’t just occurred either.  The traffic snafu occurred, and initially both driver’s remained in their cars, trying to win the Mexican standoff.  Approximately 10 minutes later (yes, you read that right) the wife of the truck driver gets bored, and exits the truck to enter the grocery store.  Give or take 10 minutes after that, bother driver’s exit and begin to argue with each other over who needs to back up to yield to the other.  At that point, someone called the police, and it took me just over 5 minutes to get there.  So here we are, playing Billy Goats Gruff for nearly 30 minutes.  And to top it all off, neither vehicle was “blocked in.”  Either driver could have reversed out of the situation and gone on their way.  But that’s not how you win a dick measuring contest, now is it?\n\nUpon realizing that the only crime that was being committed was that both of these guys could possibly reproduce, I did the following: I clarified that absolutely no crime was being committed.  I pointed out that the situation was so ridiculous that even the one guy’s wife wanted out of it.  I told them both that I’ve met kindergartners with more maturity and they deserved every minute of wasted time they were spending here, but I wouldn’t be a part of it.  I suggested that that they should find reverse, unless they were to childish to understand how cars worked.  Then I turned and laughed out loud all the way back to my patrol car.  I left, and got Starbucks.  \n\nTo this day I still can’t fathom two middle aged men stopped in a parking lot for 30 minutes because each one felt they had a perceived right of way that doesn’t even exist.\n",

        "text": "Admittedly, this is long.  But I haven't posted in a while, and this is what's on my mind right now.\n\nI am a field training officer (FTO).  For those of you not in public safety, that means I train new officers on the road.  All training begins in a class room setting.  That is generally the academy.  But after the academy, new officers (OIT’s, rookies, boots, FNG’s) come to me.  They ride with an FTO (or a variety of FTO’s) to learn how to do the job in the real world.  Being an FTO is, in my opinion, the most difficult position within an agency.  You carry a tremendous amount of responsibility and liability.  First and foremost, you are a patrol officer.  You work in uniform, in a patrol car, and you respond to calls for service as your primary job function.  Then you add a trainee.  Now you are responsible for instilling all of your knowledge and experience on to them.  That includes state law, case law, policy, Constitutional law, and on, and on.  And you’re doing this while working as a patrol officer.  Of course, teaching adults isn’t the easiest thing in the world.  Every person is different.  They learn differently, they react differently, they absorb differently.  So, you’re also a teacher, who has to constantly change his approach to effectively reach his student.  \n\nOn top of that, you are responsible for your trainee.  You are responsible for his safety, ensuring that he doesn’t get hurt or killed before learning how to do so himself.  You also carry the vicarious liability for his decisions, actions, and failures.  You need to make sure they arrest people that have to be arrested, and not arrest people that don’t.  You’d be surprised just how quickly an excited, nervous, new officer can place someone under arrest.  You are responsible for their use of force decisions, which includes deciding to use it, deciding to use too much, or not using force when it was necessary.\n\nAdditionally you have to observe and evaluate their actions and behavior, document it, provide them feedback, identify and isolate training problems, create remedial training, mentor, coach, and sometimes terminate them.\n\nIt also means that you need to know the answer.  To everything.  Right now.  Because if your OIT is turning on his red and blue lights to make a traffic stop, you’d better know if that car just violated a state statute, or matches the suspect description, or looks like the Attempt to Locate that you saw in briefing last week.  If your OIT is standing at an open door to a residence and asks you if you can go in, you need to know.  If your OIT sees something in the back seat of a car and wants to seize it, you need to know if you can.  \n\nThe most difficult part is very similar to the most difficult part of police work.  Predicting actions.  I need to constantly be several steps ahead of the suspect and my new officer, constantly attempting to predict what their next action is going to be, so I can allow it to happen, or conduct a swift override.  On more than one occasion I’ve grabbed an arm, duty belt, or shirt collar and pulled a trainee backward to prevent them from making an unlawful arrest, entering an unsafe residence, stepping in to traffic, or otherwise placing them in physical or legal harm.  \n\nBut herein lies the challenge.  If I spend all 20 weeks correcting your behavior, you’ll never learn to make decisions on your own. You won’t call on past experiences to make future decisions.  You won’t adapt or improvise.  You’ll always rely on me.  So I need to let you make mistakes.  I need to let you trip, fall, and learn.  Now obviously, I’m not going to let you get hurt, or hurt anyone else.  I won’t let you make a bad arrest or illegal search.  But if you turn left instead of right (which I noticed.  I always notice.) I’ll let you drive the wrong way for a bit. If you think you know the crime, but can’t really specify, I’ll let you flounder for a minute before directing you to look it up.  And depending on what sage of training we’re in, if a suspect isn’t really listening to you, I might let it go on to see what it takes for you to take control.  At times I feel like I’m on a 5 second delay behind my trainee, giving them time to react before I do.\n\nThat’s where our story begins. Last February my trainee responded to a report of a physical domestic behind a department store.  We arrived as the 2nd unit on scene.  What we find is a 17 year old kid and his grandmother arguing fairly loudly.  Through interviews, we learn that the grandmother is the boy’s guardian.  Dad is in prison, and mom is in jail.  Obviously, he hasn’t had a picture perfect youth.  Now he lives with grandma.  And for whatever reason, today he doesn’t want to.  So he left home and called his aunt to come pick him up.  In my state, juveniles cannot leave home without permission of their guardian, or they are considered runaways.  The kid is really upset, very vocal, and using a plethora of curse words. My trainee and the other officer on scene do a fairly good job of talking everyone down and trying to find a solution.  \n\nThe boy says that he wants to go to his aunt’s house for the weekend.  Separately, the grandmother says that the boy needs to stay home.  He has chores to do, and she doesn’t want to have to pick him up tomorrow.  At this point, things are calm, and I’m about 20 feet from my trainee, standing, watching, observing.  The other officer breaks the news to the kid.  “You’re going to go home with your grandmother.”  He did not handle it well.  H starts of with some “fuck you’s,” goes in to the “you’re not in charge of me,” followed by the “fuck all of this, I’m leaving.”  Now, personally, I don’t allow people to yell at me.  A little venting?  Sure.  Expressing some frustrations?  Yeah.  But when it’s decision time, and I’ve told you how something is going to go down, we’re done.  Especially if you’re 17.  However, my trainee didn’t really intervene at that point.  The boy and the other officer are going back and forth with the officer telling him what’s going to happen, and the boy telling the officer how to go fuck himself.\n\nAnd then it happens.  The moment.  The decision.  The kid yells “Fuck this.  Fuck you.  I don’t need to deal with this.”  And then he turns to walk away.  In my cop brain, this is the decisive moment.  This is the very point where the 17 year old is challenging the authority of his grandmother and the officers on scene.  He is pushing the boundaries, and the further he can push them, the more confident he will be in continuing. At that very second, the trainee should have grabbed him, placed him in a control hold, and hand cuffed him.  He is actively committing a crime. He has been stopped and told what’s going to happen. He is a juvenile who doesn’t enjoy the luxuries and freedoms afforded to adults. And he needed to know that he was not in charge at that time.  Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5…\n\n\nAs he turns and starts to cross the road, I call out to my trainee.  “Smith.”  Nothing.  “Smith.” Still no reaction.  “Smith you need to stop him.”  But my trainee is standing there, vapor locked. They are holding a pen in one hand and their notepad in the other.  \n\nSee, the thing is, as humans we fall back on Recognition Primed Decision Making.  When we need to make a decision, our brain flips back through our file cabinet of previous experiences to find something equal or similar that worked out in the past.  As an 11 year veteran, my file cabinet is fairly full.  When I encounter a problem, my brain says “I know something that worked last time” and I move forward with that.  If it works out again, my file gets validated.  If it doesn’t, my file gets updated.  But unfortunately, with only 7 weeks on the job, my OIT’s filing cabinet is more like a file folder.  At that moment, I’m guessing their brain was going “Shit.  He leaving.  He told me I’m not in charge of him.  Am I in charge of him? Can I make him go home?  Can he leave?  Can I stop him?  If so, how? Is this a crime?  If so, is it a misdemeanor, felony, or petty offense?  Can I use handcuffs?  What if he runs?  Do I chase?  Can I tackle him?  What? How? Can I?  Do I?  Should I?  FUCK!!”\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5….\n\n“SMITH! Go.  Stop.  Him.  Now!”  Smith then fumbles to put away their notepad which now has become a burdensome ball and chain somehow permanently affixed to their right hand.  After slipping it in their back pocket, Smith starts across the street to follow the kid, who now feels slightly more in control than he did 3 minutes ago because he’s been allowed to walk away unchallenged.  Smith catches up and is now following him down the sidewalk trying to use their words to get him to comply. This leads to a curse word laden exchange between the two, in which the boy made it clear he had no intentions of stopping.  Then he sinks his right hand in to his pocket.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5…\n\n“Smith.  Watch his hands.”  Smith tells him to get his hand back out of his pocket.  And then, a decision. The kid yanks his hand out of his pant pocket, holding a black object.  I can see it, and my Recognition Primed Decision Making is flipping through h files as quickly as it can.  It’s the size of a knife, but the shape isn’t right.  It’s too small to be a gun. What the hell is it?  Simultaneously, he turns to face my trainee and says “Why?  You think I’m going to hurt you?” while flinching his right hand with the object at Officer Smith’s face.  No five seconds this time.\n\nImmediately, I yell out “Smith, Handcuffs.”  The other officer on scene is now also caught up to us (he was initially talking to grandma a little further away).  Smith grabs one arm, and the officer grabs the other.  And another decision. He tenses up.  He takes a wide stance with his legs, and flexes his arms so they can’t get his hands behind his back.  The verbal commands start coming out.  Relax.  Stop fighting us.  Stop resisting.  You need to stop now.  But think about what he’s been able to get away with so far.  Telling grandma to fuck off.  Telling 3 cops to fuck off.  Walking away.  And punching toward a cop while grinning.  HE’s full of confidence, and convinced that this is still going to work out in his favor.  At the same time, consider the officers.  No matter what you read in some other subs, we don’t want to hurt people. Graham vs Connor tells us that we need to consider the severity of the crime, the threat to the public or the officer, and whether or not the suspect is attempting to attack or flee.  In this case we started with being a runaway, escalated to interfering with an officer, escalated to an (admittedly weak) assault on an officer, escalated to resisting arrest.  He is demonstrating that he is a threat to the officer as we still haven’t identified the black object and he’s running through a list of preattack indicators.  And he clearly is trying to flee.  So Graham vs Connor says we can use force.  A higher level even with his behavior.  But he’s 17.  And his grandmother is right there.  And it all started as a runaway.  So while knee strikes to the common peroneal would have been completely justified, I always picture the “Cops repeatedly kicking 17 year old runaway” headline in my mid.  Not to mention that I wasn’t even making the arrest.  My trainee was.  And I know that their brain was just spinning trying figure out all that Graham v Connor stuff I just laid out for you guys. \n\nSo there we are.  This stocky kid, who wrestled in high school, and thinks he’s running the show, in a wide stance with muscles tensed feeling more and more empowered by the second.  And two officers who are only there because a series of bad decisions over several years led to this kid not wanting to be there at this time, holding each of his arms.  It’s a bit of a stale mate.  \n\nI step in.  What happens next isn’t so clear.  We attempt a takedown that was supposed to be a forward sweep.  But of course, things are dynamic.  As we move, he moves.  As he goes down, my left arm gets caught between his back, and the officer behind him.  I had not intended on going to the ground.  Intended.\n\nAs we fall to the ground, my left arm is trapped and immobilized by at least 2 bodies.  I catch myself with my right arm to save my face from meeting the sidewalk.  My left shoulder, however, is not so lucky. While my shoulder hits the sidewalk, my arm is extended from my body, and my palm is facing back.  As I land face down, my arm is forced behind me, with my arm extended.  And I hear the SNAP.\n\nI’m able to get my arm out, though my shoulder is definitely fucked up.  The kid is still thoroughly enjoying himself and continues to talk shit.  Having had quite enough of this, I draw my Taser, hold it in front of him, spark it, and inform him that if he doesn’t comply right now, he’s going to take a 5 second ride that will result in excruciating pain, a lot of screaming, and possibly some incontinence.  He decides he’s done.\n\nMy trainee drives me to the hospital where they patch up my cut knees and elbow, and X-Ray my shoulder.  No bones broken.  Skipping ahead, follow up appointments show a torn rotator cuff.  As I ask around I hear the same thing over and over.  Shoulder surgery is one of the most painful surgeries, and one of the hardest to recover from.  Frequently requiring additional surgeries in the future.  \n\nSo I start every doctor’s appointment with the same phrase. “I don’t want surgery.”  I spend months doing everything I can to avoid surgery.  Physical therapy, a TENS unit, PRP injections. All the while working full duty.  Why?  Because my agency is hiring a lot and they are short on trainers.  If I went to the desk, it would affect a lot of other people.  So I decide to keep working.  But every day I’m in pain.  Driving and pushing open heavy doors just kill me.  I can’t sit comfortably.  I can’t lean on my elbow at a desk or table.  I take Ibuprofen during the day and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale at night.  I wake up every hour or so because of the pain.  I can’t pick up my kids any more.  I carry groceries in with my right arm.  And I’m trying to learn to sleep on my back.\n\nFinally my doctor tells me I’m out of options.  I need to consent to surgery, or I need to decide to deal with it.  A week later, while trying again to turn my truck to the right, my arm shakes and I wince in pain.  I can’t do this anymore.\n\nI had the surgery at the end of January.  I’ve been on medical leave since. My shoulder still hurts.  Worse than it did before.  I take a Percocet and 2 Ultram every evening, otherwise I can’t fall asleep. I wake up throughout the night.  I can’t sit comfortably.  Walking too long becomes painful.  The best position is lying on my back in bed.  But that’s about as useless as you can be.  I’m not used to feeling useless.  My wife had to take a week off of work to help out with the kids, and me, at home.    I can’t work overtime jobs to supplement our income.  I can’t work in my garden.  I can barely get my chicken’s eggs, let alone clean their coop.  My German Shepherd and 2 Mastiffs don’t understand why we don’t go to the dog park any more.  I still can’t pick up my kids.  Even cooking is painful and frustrating.  I put in for archery Elk tags in September.  If I get drawn, there’s no guarantee that I can go.\n\nIt’s been almost 4 weeks and I’m not noticing an improvement.  In fact, I’d say it’s worse now than it ever was.  I’m beginning to run scenarios through my mind in which I don’t get better.  Then what?  Do I live uncomfortably the rest of my life?  Do I have a daily regimen of pain killers just to try to sleep?  Am I supposed to give up hunting, backpacking, rock climbing, archery?  All of my loves in life are very physical.  I love the outdoors.  Do I just give that up?\n\nWhat if it’s career ending?  What if the doctor does all he can, and I don’t regain full range of motion.  Or the same strength I had before.  Then what?  A medical retirement?  That’s it?  I’m out?  11 years in, 35 years old, and I have to medically retire?  What the fuck?  Why?\n\nBecause two people decided to have a child. Then they made a series of bad decisions that led to their incarceration.  They decided to send their child to grandma’s house where he wasn’t happy. So he decided to leave one day.  Grandma decided to call the police for assistance.   My trainee decided to respond to the call.  The kid decided to push the boundaries and walk away.  My trainee couldn’t make a decision fast enough.  The kid decided to flinch a punch at an officer.  I decided to step in. He decided to continue to resist.  We all decided to use kid gloves with him.\n\nAnd here I am. Trying to decide what to do next.\n\n",

        "text": "A few years ago, when I was barely 20 and a little bit dumb, I was hanging out with a couple friends of mine. Both women. They both were a touch younger than me and very impressed with me. See, at the time I did parkour. They really wanted to see me do some cool stuff. I was eager to impress the girls.\n\nIf was around 2 AM. We were passing through a city park, one that happens to have some old restored train cars set up for display. Our city happens to have bylaws against being in a park at night, but these are loosely enforced and mostly exist just to keep people from living there.\n\nI run up to one of the rail cars and scale it super quick, and before I could do anything else. red blue red blue. Ah hell.\n\nEven then I had no fear of cops, especially since what I had done wasn't really that bad. So I wave at them, and slowly begin climbing down to go talk to the officers.\n\nBy the time I get to the ground, my friends are running down the street, and the police car is chasing them. Oh hell no, my idiot friends panicked. Hoping to keep then from getting arrested, I put my hands in the air and also chase after the car. I lost them for a few minutes, and then came up to one of the officers lecturing my crying friend about running. Apparently she tried to curl up and hide behind a tree, while her giant red backpack made it glaringly obvious where she was. Out of breath I run up and tell the officers that I was the one up on the train and she was just watching. The officers were very standoff-ish, but sent her on her way and then started grilling me.\n\nAfter i regained my breath and started to talk calmly, they cooled down a bit too. They had been nonstop questioning me about what i was doing and what I intended, which I answered honestly (\"im a young guy showing off for girls like an idiot\") they took my information, and then they calmed down a great deal. \n\nAt this point they explained that a couple nights ago around this time, someone  tried to torch one of the train cars, and when they spotted me they figured I was the guy who came back to finish the job. Given that I could have easily gotten away when my friend ran like an idiot, and that I was cooperating, they were satisfied that my shenanigans were unrelated. Ended up giving me a $50 citation for being in a park after hours (which is literally the smallest fine they could have given me) and told me to go tell my crying friend that running from the cops is a bad idea.\n\nTo this day I jokingly give her a hard time about it, referring to it as \"that time you almost got me arrested\"",

        "text": "“You’re taking the sergeant’s process?\n\n“Yeah, so?” I was listening in on my field training officer talking with one of the other senior officers on the squad, Doug, over dinner. \n\n“Nothing, I guess. You just don’t strike me as the boss type.” My trainer expressed his doubt around the forkful of beef and broccoli he was shoving in his mustache framed mouth. \n\n“Well, way I figure, someone around here needs to get some bars on their shoulder and show these assholes how to properly supervise.” Doug tried and failed to use his chopsticks on his fried rice and dug through the table refuse for a clean spork. \n\n“So, you’re suggesting you’re not going to turn into an asshole too?”\n\n“Really!?!? Me? Asshole? Nah, I’m going to be the best boss this place has seen. My guys are going to love me.”\n\nA yell from the cashier in some Asian-based language directed towards her kitchen staff covered the snigger from my FTO as he returned to his MSG laden heart attack on a plate.\n\n\n“So, Doug’s getting transferred back.” I contemplated aloud over the news from my buddy, Mark. \n\n“Yeah, you know about him?” Mark asked, looking up from his computer and half finished accident report. \n\n“He was on my first squad, when I was training. He seemed like a d-bag back then, and I haven’t heard anything good about him as a boss to change my opinion.”\n\nMark sighed and looked out his windshield. “Well, tell someone to get off second shift and I’ll come work with you. If this guy’s going to suck, I’ll be happy to get out of here.” \n\n“Don’t think any spots are going to open any time soon.” I chuckled. “Good luck with the new guy.”\n\nSergeant Doug arrived a few weeks later. His first night, Mark reported back to me the good news. “He seems cool; said he’s happy to be back and is going to go easy on the paperwork. As long as we come in with something proving we did our job, he’ll be all good.”\n\n“I’ll believe it when I see it.” I scoffed over my coffee mug. \n\n“Whatever, not everyone’s a dick, y’know.” Mark said. \n\n“Oh, I know. But I think Doug is.” I dropped my car in gear and flicked on my headlights. “Let me know when he changes over to the dark side. I hear day shift is going to have an opening next pay-period.” Mark replied with an annoyed shake of his head. “It’s late, time to turn in my paper. Have fun with sergeant d-bag!” I peeled out, spraying gravel back at Mark’s cruiser and laughed at his raised middle finger in my side-view mirror. \n\nA week or so later, Mark had an update. “Ok, so maybe he’s not the guy I was hoping he’d be.”\n\nWe were car-to-car in our usual municipal parking lot and I was not surprised. “Yeah?”\n\n“He’s been stalking us after it dies down, sneaking up on us while we do paper and catch a nap. It’s crap! Our old sarge understood how tough it was to get through the night after a morning court session and running after sick kids during the day.” \n\n“I feel your pain. How’s that day shift looking?” \n\n“Not good. A couple of the senior guys are going to have a word with him. Maybe he’ll change after that.” His lack of enthusiasm in the plan was obvious in his tone. \n\n“And when that doesn’t work?” I asked, voicing the doubt Mark refused to. \n\n“I guess I keep an eye on my six and go to court tired. It’s almost midnight, shouldn’t you be heading in?” \n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“If you spray me with gravel again, I swear you’ll find something either missing or soggy from in your locker tomorrow afternoon.”\n\n “C’mon, Marky-Mark. I’m not the kind of guy to kick someone when they’re down.” I eased out of the lot and smiled at the now common farewell finger barely illuminated by my departing brake lights. \n\nThe next tour, Mark had another update. “Dude, he’s a tyrant.”\n\n“Hate to say I told you so.” \n\n“So don’t, it won’t help.” Mark’s voice took a sharp edge. “He’s got the Lt. under his spell too. They’ve prioritized DWI’s and traffic violations, couldn’t care less about criminal any more. I guess my dreams of investigations are dumpster worthy now.”\n\n“Y’know,” I started, deciding it was time to reveal my proposal to Mark. “The computers don’t send updated GPS signals if they’re not docked.”\n\nOur in-car computers had just been updated to include GPS beacons that told other computers as well as the dispatchers where every car that was logged on to the system was located. They were, as most new technologies, not a welcome addition as most road dogs who would be the primary users immediately saw the down side of having big brother looking over them. We were assured by the higher ups the system was only to be used to aid in dispatching and setting up perimeters on major events. The update to our SOP’s hadn’t happened yet, though, so some supervisors were relishing the opportunity to catch some of their guys with their pants down, so to speak.\n\n“So what? It doesn’t do much good unless we have the key to unlock the dock.” \n\nI aimed my reflected dome light into Mark’s faith-lacking eye. The glimmer from the chrome plated dock key made him recant his doubt in me. “You sunnova… how’d you…?”\n\n“Some of us have supervisors who are happy to oblige in the occasional righteous social upheaval.” Mark accepted my gift with wide, gracious eyes. “Just make sure you get it back to me when you’re done. I don’t want to get on my boss’s bad side.”\n\nLater that evening, Mark moved forward with the mayhem. He and a partner un-docked their computers in a park known to be accommodating to napping midnight officers. The map showed two cruisers, parked door-to-door, even though their now off-line counterparts were a mile or so away in another hiding spot. Mark later recounted to me the joy he took from watching Doug’s police car avatar creep up on the GPS ghosts and later, from the angry glances he cast at Mark and his partner during paperwork turn-in. \n\n“Dude, it was awesome, but I think he knows what’s up. Take back the key; I’ll have to figure something else out.” I agreed and told Mark I’d also think on the problem and a solution that would show Doug what a tyrant he was being. \n\nThe next night, Mark gave me the disturbing update. “I think he learned from our prank.”\n\nDoug had crept up on Mark and his partner even as they had been monitoring the GPS map. He recounted the horrific event in detail: \n\n“Me and Matty, we were parked in the normal lot. I was catching up on paper, he was sleeping. I was keeping an eye out, y’know?, for anyone coming up on us as well as our sergeant buddy. Well, ‘knock-knock-knock’ on my passenger window and there he was, smiling and looking like the smug asshole he is. ‘Where’s the key?’ he asked. I played dumb, eventually telling him there must’ve been a glitch that caused the GPS thing the night before. I think he bought it, but I noticed his cruiser was still showing it was parked out in front of the station. D-bag must’ve undocked his computer too. That, or he walked the three miles from the station to the parking lot just to creep me out.”\n\nI didn’t put it past him but knew he must have become savvy to the flaw in the system. “SO, what’s your next move?” I asked. \n\n“I guess it’s back to the head-on-a-swivel routine. God, this sucks.” I didn’t have any alternative to offer but gave my condolences instead. \n\nWeeks passed before there was any change. Mark and I were just pulling up to our normal spot and I could read the excitement on his face from a mile away. “Dude,” He started, “I might be onto something.”\n\nMark went on to explain that he had taken up roving parking checks, looking for trespassers, in lieu of finding quiet spots to take some down time in. His reasoning was the less sedentary his shifts, the less flack he’d get from Doug. What he didn’t expect was to roll up on his boss, passed out, alone (a big third shift no-no) in a secluded park. \n\n“So, what’s the plan?” I asked, eager for more mischief.\n\n“Well, I told some of the more trustworthy guys on the squad about it and they’re just as fed up as me. I have a group of about six of us who are ready to make this thing happen.”\n\nA few days later there were some strange events in the very early hours of a quiet weeknight morning. Doug was passed out once again, in another equally isolated park. In review of the GPS records, after the fact, it appeared as though three patrol vehicles were busy at a party call (self initiated), while three more were marked out on a foot patrol in one of the seedier areas – a common occurrence for our station. It’s unknown exactly how the sergeant’s car was wrapped so quickly and entirely in crime scene tape, the details are still foggy. It’s also foggy how a picture of the cruiser was taken, flash and all, with Doug’s drool leaking mouth agape and in clear view of the camera. Likewise, it’s unclear how a Xeroxed copy ended up in the sergeant’s mailbox with the cryptic message “The commander doesn’t know about the docking key trick” scribbled on it in Sharpie. \n\nNothing was ever said aloud about the event – the sarge never even acknowledged it had happened. The only outward appearance of anything changing was the sudden drop in write-ups from Doug’s desk for sleeping on duty and the increase in morale and productivity from his squad. \n",

        "text": "The wrecker pulled away with the borrowed and now beat-up sedan on its flat bed. \n\n“You want me to follow you to the station so numb-nuts can get interviewed?” Darren pulled my attention back to the scene.  \n\n“Sure, thanks.” I had already called ahead and confirmed the domestic violence detective would be waiting for us in an interview room. \n\nI made my way back to my cruiser, nestled in the middle of the line of several other police vehicles with their strobing lights entrancing the passing rubberneckers. Jonny was waiting for me in the passenger seat, wide eyed and sweaty. His deluge of question surged out the door as soon as I opened it. \n\n“Where’s that car going? Did you get my stuff out of it? That backpack, by the way: it’s not mine. I was wrong. Did you look in it? I think it belongs to the lady who owns the car. Did you talk to her? Why am I under arrest?”\n\n“Whoa, calm down. We’re going to head over to the station and there’s a detective there who can answer your questions a lot better than I can.” \n\n“Yeah but, like, why would you even arrest me? Why’d you hit my car?” Jonny was rocking back in forth in his seat in an agitated state. \n\n“You’ve got warrants. That’s all you need to know.” Darren pulled out into traffic and let me nudge my cruiser into the travel lane as well. A huddle of cops turned to wave at my passenger who huffed an annoyed breath in reply. \n\n“I ain’t even touch that bitch.” He muttered under his breath. \n\n“Huh?” I feigned ignorance but had a good idea who he was referring to. “Touch who?”\n\n“Nuthin’, man. Just drive.” He screwed his body so that his back faced me and sullenly stared out the window in silence the rest of the drive. \n\nWe went in through the front of the station, through a gathering of Girl Scouts who were filing in to the community room. I smiled and nodded, Jonny ignored their whispers and sniggers as we made our way to the secure area and interview rooms. We met the detective in the hall and she half-glanced at Jonny before taking his arm and pulling him into the interview room like he was a bag of groceries. She sat him down without a word and closed the door behind her, more worried that I was going to leave than Jonny’s well-being. \n\n“Can you stay? Or do you have to go? Because I can handle this, I think. But if you can stay, that would be good too. But, of course, you can go if you need to.” She smiled sheepishly as she asked my status, giving off an air of desperation. \n\n“Are you sure you’re good? Because I have a lot of paperwork to do after PIT-ing his car and all.” I wasn’t falling for her kitten eyes.\n\n“Oh. I think I’ll be ok. Unless you want to stick around, of course, which is totally cool.” Her face fell and I knew she was uncomfortable with doing the interview solo. “I just usually deal with the victims is all. Most cases come to me with the warrants already taken care of by patrol. I usually just tell the victim how and when to get to court and am there for moral support, y’know?” \n\nI sighed. “Well, I could grab my laptop and work on my paper here at the desk. I’ll listen in on what you’re asking and what he says and see if there’s anything I think should be added.” I had just come out of the investigations section where criminal interrogations were commonplace. I had always enjoyed that aspect of the job – the verbal wrestling match that could make or break a case. I was a little interested in the outcome anyway. \n\n“Really? That’d be great. I’ll set up the video feed if you can keep an eye on him.” She hurried off and I leaned against the desk behind me, hoping this was going to be a quick process. I really did have a lot of paperwork to do. \n\nThe detective returned and gave me a minute to gather my supplies before mentally centering herself for the coming trial. She reached for the door but paused at the last moment. “Oh, by the way. Did he say anything to you about the case? Does he seem drunk or high? And, is he OK medically from the PIT?”\n\n“Didn’t say much – owned up to the backpack (I motioned to his property bag, the back pack on prominent display with the spoils of his burglary spilling out) but later distanced himself from it. Seems coherent enough if not a little pissed off. He refused rescue at the scene so he’s medically cleared too.” I settled into my chair and fired up my laptop as she nodded and scribbled noted on her legal pad.\n \n“Thanks.” She said before entering his lair. \n\nThe interview went as expected: Jonny refuted all allegations of his involvement, denied entering the home and threatening Wendy, said he ran from us when we tried to stop him because he was ‘scared we were drug dealers trying to kill him.’ She’d go back and re-question him on specifics (“Are you sure you didn’t go into the house the other night? Even to get some of your own property?”) and he’d give a totally different excuse. It was pretty comical, really, but I noticed the detective was eating it all up as if Jonny was answering under the effects of sodium pentothal. After about fifteen minutes and half a page of notes, she took a break and exited. \n\n“Well, I guess my case is shot, huh?” She slouched onto the desk and shook her head in dismay. \n\n“What? Really? You’re buying all that? He went into the house ‘with a drug dealer who threatened to kill him,\" I made finger quotes in the air to accentuate the statement's absurdity, \"then accidently backed into the fish tank’? Sounds like his conflicting statements are going to kill him on the stand to me.”\n\nThe detective puckered her face into an expression of contemplation. “Yeah, but if he’s going to say he was forced to do it, I can’t prove malicious intent, right?”\n\nI was dumfounded and needed a second to quiet the screams in my head calling out her investigative ignorance. “Well,” I finally started, “How about the phone stuff? You have them all printed out. Show him the dick-pic he sent her and when he owns up to that he’ll have to own the threats he sent as well, right?” \n\nHer face brightened. “You’re right!” She flipped though her case file and pulled out the offending photo, gave me an appreciative nod, and entered the room for round two. \n\nJonny saw the photo and laughed. He leaned in and smirked in a flirting way while saying he did, in fact, send Wendy that photo. The trap was sprung and the detective pulled out the next printed-off text, a thinly veiled threat on Wendy’s life sent two minutes later.\n\n“Oh, that? The drug dealer took my phone and sent that. That wasn’t me. I think Wendy owes the dude money or something.” The wind left Jonny’s flirtatious sails and he leaned away while the detective’s happy body language similarly dissolved. \n\n“One sec.” She told him, and made her way out the room. \n\n“Well, I guess he’s got me there.” She almost sobbed.\n\nAgain, the level of gullibility took me aback. “I think you’ll be fine. Put your evidence before any judge or jury and his story comes nowhere near creating a reasonable doubt. That’s all you have to worry about.” I tried to be reassuring. \n\n“Well, it’s too late to take back the warrants now anyway, right? I mean, he’s locked up. I guess I’ll hold off on any new charges until I talk to the prosecutor.”\n\nI closed my laptop, giving up on the farce of an interrogation. “Sounds like a plan. Look, I gotta go. Let me know if you need anything else, OK? Your case is solid. Keep Wendy in the loop and make sure she knows to let out how scared she was. It'll be a homerun, really.” I nodded hello at the patrolman who was taking my place at the desk, pulled early from his roll call to assist in transport to the jail. The detective called goodbye behind me as I exited back into the lobby.\n\nA short drive and lot of paperwork later, I somehow made it home only half an hour later than usual. My wife had waited for me to take the family to the grocery store and I described my day to her as we drove there. She took it all in stride, years of practice ignoring the more dangerous aspects of my job showing through. I think we were in the cereal aisle when my phone rang. I looked down and saw it was from the detective. \n\n“Ugh, I have to take this, sorry.” My wife rolled her eyes but quickly went back to price checking Mini-Wheats. \n\n“All set? Did he get bond?” I asked as an answer to the ring.\n\n“EMR? Oh, good. He got… I don’t know how, but… This is bad!” She sounded breathless and panicked. \n\n“What did he do?” My gut dropped as I awaited the forthcoming bad news. \n\n“He got away?”\n\n“What?!? How? Have you called Wendy yet?”\n\n“I don’t know, I wasn’t there, I’m heading back in now. He said he needed to go the hospital because you guys beat him and his neck hurt so patrol took him. He ran away when he was discharged and now we don’t know where he is!” The panic was stronger and her voice was quaking while she delivered the news. \n\n“Well, someone needs to get a hold of Wendy. The hospital is only a mile from her house. You call her, I’ll start heading that way as soon as I can.” I hung up before she could reply and turned to my wife.\n\n“You need to go back in?” She asked with mild annoyance. \n\n“Uh, yeah. I think so.” \n\nShe let loose a deep sigh and pushed the cart forward. “C’mon kiddos, daddy needs a ride.”\n\n\nMy phone buzzed with several calls on the way back home to my cruiser; the lieutenant running the squad working the street had several questions, most of which I was in no position to know the answer to; the duty officer asked me what I was going to do to find the guy; my boss called with questions regarding the entire case. \n\nEventually I was able to piece together the scenario of Jonny’s escape: After several more minutes of unproductive interview, Jonny requested an ambulance for ‘injuries he got from the beating we gave him when we pulled him from his car.’ The patrol guy who was going to transport him refused to call an ambulance but said he’d swing by the ER while on the way to jail. Jonny was in our custody and to involve an ambulance would also involve the removal of a second unit from the already thread-bare patrol shift to follow behind to the hospital. Generally speaking, if a cop brings a guy in handcuffs into the ER, he’s ushered through as quick as possible so as not to freak out the other patients. \n\nFollowing a quick check of his vitals and probing of his “injuries,” Jonny was determined to be in perfect shape and discharged back into police custody. For some reason, he was cuffed in front as he exited the ER and followed behind the cop as he crossed the ambulance bay back to the awaiting black-and-white. As an ambulance came tearing into the bay with its own emergency, Jonny used the distraction to book it over a hedge and sprint around a corner before the cop even realized he was missing. When the cop unlocked his cruiser door and recited the “watch your head” line, there was no one there to roll their eyes at him. He called it in on his radio and by the time I had caught up with the event, several stations worth of patrol, two K9s and the helicopter were searching for Jonny with frantic urgency. \n\nI got a hold of Wendy who assured me she was safe, well away from her home with her child. She was scared out of her wits and amazed (as was I) at the string of ineptitude that led to our current predicament. \n\n“Don’t worry, we’ll find him.” Was all I could say to ease her worry, but I was very concerned how that would come about. Jonny’s phone was still in our custody in his property bag so there was no way to contact him. His family all lived a state away and his friends were all dirt bags who wouldn’t cooperate with the police even if he did seek them out for assistance. He was a desperate man who was last seen running in the direction of a huge apartment complex and now had an even more actionable grudge against his ex-girlfriend. To say there was a risk to public safety was an understatement. \n\nI began combing his social media and police contacts for possible associates who lived nearby. I eliminated any who had criminal histories (likely to tell me to take a hike) and narrowed it down to two who were within jogging distance of the hospital. I passed along the info to patrol and kept hitting the computer, hoping some inspiration would come to me and I’d stumble across a golden goose. \n\nSuddenly, the radio came to life. “X-Ray thirty-six-ten, foot pursuit!” \n\nI pulled up the patrol map with all the cops plotted wherever their cruiser-born GPS units said they were. X3610 was at a subway stop up the road from the hospital. \n\n“X3610, I have the escapee running South from the station, black hoodie, black hat.”\n\nThe responding lights and sirens were already screaming by my post at the ER. \n\n“GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!! X-3610 ONE AT GUN POINT!” \n\nThe broadcast curse word was a major faux pas but considering the circumstances, I understood. A moment later a backup unit came across, advising they had Jonny in custody. I decided I’d make a run for home while I could, resolute I’d get the story the following morning and not willing to face the wrongful ire of those who thought I had something to do with the escape. \n\n/u/DetectiveBrandon provided the resolution the following day: After fleeing, Jonny made his way to an apartment complex – not the one we had been searching, mind you, the officer’s attempt to save face and bad account of which way Jonny had run pushed us all in the wrong direction – and saw an old man exiting his car with an armful of grocery bags. He had already managed to pull one hand free from his poorly applied handcuffs and approached his mark, snatching a bag under the guise he wanted to be a good Samaritan. The old man was perturbed but didn’t cause a scene and led the way to his apartment. Once there, Jonny told him he was armed and would kill the man unless he helped him escape. The old man agreed and provided the black hooded sweatshirt and knit hat before driving Johnny to the subway station so he could make good his try for freedom. When Jonny exited the car, the old man made a break for it and called the police when he got back to his house. \n\nJonny, meanwhile, crossed the parking lot and ran in to some cops standing in a loose group by the entrance, just chatting while their fellow patrolmen and several other assets swarmed the area. When Jonny saw them and realized his ride had left, he panicked and took off running, catching the eye of one of the less lazy cops in the group. He called out then pursued, eventually catching up with our fugitive and tackling him in a nearby drainage culvert. They fought briefly until several other cops arrived and took Jonny into custody with “that amount of force necessary to affect the arrest.” \n\nI was sorry I wasn’t there to see it come to its ultimate conclusion, but glad, months later, my name was never brought up in the impending internal investigations case. \n\nJonny was found guilty of several of the felonies levied against him and, thanks to his terrible criminal history and proclivity to escape custody, sentenced to a couple decades in one of our fine penal institutions. \n",

It's always really interesting to see how other people do things and how training differs from city to city. \n\nThis particular ridealong came from when I visited a subtropical corner of the US, and got a ridealong for the afternoon shift. I was paired with a lady officer (Officer Susan, I'll call her), who while a bit on the terse side, was an interesting person to follow around and we talked a fair amount about the differences in scheduling and training between the department she worked for and the one I was applying to.  \n\nI felt really bad for Susan, because she told me that since she was stuck on afternoon shifts 5 days a week, for 8 hours, she only got to see her kid on sunday evenings, when he came home his dad's place. Apparently, this a common problem among the afternoon shift crew, which startled me, as the local department I was applying to operated on a 4 days on, 4 days off schedule. \n\nWe had three calls that night, one was mopping up the tail end of an assault - sitting with the victim waiting for an ambulance while another two officers dealt with the suspect across the street.   \n\nThe second was a shoplifting deal, pretty uneventful. Shoplifter had warrants out, so another officer (out of the five that showed up) took him into custody.   \n\nIt was at this point that Susan told me that it wasn't unusual for every officer in the district to show up at a call if things were slow. This was a very small, but tourist heavy urban area, so it had a lot of officers covering about 5 square kilometres. \n\nThe final call was another assault-in-progress type thing. By this time, it was full dark and street lights were few and far between. We rushed over to the area, and drove around for several minutes trying to find the complainants in a forested, park-like area. Eventually, I spotted a row of vans in a parking lot and when we pulled up, a short native dude stumbles into view and starts walking towards us.  He's short, maybe 5'3\", stocky, with a scraggly beard. He's also bleeding from a head wound and he's angry. \n\nNow, I'm a first aid attendant normally, and I've seen me a decent amount of head wounds. They bleed like crazy, but usually, the blood is all over the place, and it's a matter of containment. This one, I had a hard time looking away from, because I'd never seen anything like it. \n\nThis time, the blood was flowing down his face in a single, huge rivulet, about one inch wide. And you could tell it had been bleeding for awhile, because the outer edges had started coagulating.  So it was more like an inch-wide a tube of blood flowing down his face and neck, until it hit his shirt and blossomed red outwards from there.  It wasn't going anywhere else, it was just coming out of a deep, but small wound a couple inches above his eye. I should mention this tube had acquired a depth to it as well. \n\nAnyways, this guy was angry, but it took me a minute to key into what he was saying, as I had been distracted by the tube'o'blood on his face.  \n\nThere had been a dispute, though each time Susan and the other officer, Tony, attempted to clarify matters, the reason for the dispute changed slightly. Initially, it seemed to be a matter of money owing. Then missing keys for one of the vans. Then one of the vans seemed to have gone missing, before it cycled back to money owing.  Then somehow the van had been moved without permission.    The only solid fact that I could discern was that another man, now prudently absent, had pushed Angry Victim down and hit him.  \n\n\"But don't worry,\" said Angry Victim. \"I'll take care of him.\"\n\n\"So you don't want to press charges?\" repeated Susan again. \n\n\"Naw naw, I'll take care of him.\" \n\n\"No charges then?\" said Tony skeptically. \"You sure?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure man,\" \n\nThere was a shared glance, and a collective eyeroll. \n\n\"Now,\" said Susan leadingly. \"How exactly are you going to take care of him?\"\n\nThere was an awkward pause. Angry Victim looks as though he knew something was supposed to occur to him, but was coming up blank.  \"Well, you know. I'll take care of him,\" he finishes, lamely.\n\n\"You do realize that if you hit him, and he wants to press charges, we're going to have to arrest you.\" \n\n\"What? You serious man?!\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\nInstantly, a beatific expression takes over Angry Victim, suddenly a short, more frog-like version of the angel of saintly patience. \"Ahh no man, you don't got nothing to worry about. My daddy taught me forgiveness is the way to go man. No hard feelings. We're good we're good. Daddy taught me to be forgiving man.\" \n\n\"Right, OK then,\" said Susan, clearly barely containing another eyeroll as the ambulance rolled up. \"Let's get you going with these guys.\" \n\n\"Oh no man, I'll be fine. This is nothing, I'm OK.\" \n\n\"At least let them take a look at you?\" \n\n\"No no no I'm good.\" \n\nSeveral more minutes of back-and-forth over trying to get this guy into the ambulance. I even chime in (up to this point, I had been just a silent observer), along with the paramedics, but it takes all of us to convince the guy he should at least sit on the bumper of the ambulance (after he was promised he wouldn't have to sign anything) and get cleaned up.  At this point, his forgiving mood had improved the point where he started trying to tell Susan and myself about how we were both such 'pretty ladies' and letting us know he'd happily get to know us better.  \n\nAnd then the radio crackled, and we heard something that turned both officers to ice. \n\n\"All units, ten thirty three [name]. Ten thirty three\" \n\nThe radio erupted with chatter, too fast for me to follow. Susan and Tony stood rooted to the spot, staring at each other with bleak expressions, even as we heard Angry Victim yammering at the paramedics cleaning him up behind us. \n\nI had no idea what had happened. Another officer rolled up and leaned out his window. \"You guys taking [highway #] tonight?\" \n\n\"Is that where it happened?\" \n\n\"They say a truck got him on a traffic stop. He was just taking docs to the main station.\" \n\nWhat followed was one of the longest silences of my life.  The city went on with life, but for us, it had come to a sickening halt. \n\nWe wrapped up the call without another word about it. \n\nWalking back to Susan's squad car, I couldn't help but ask about another matter that had been confusing me. \n\n \"Well, I know you guys have to pay for this, but is that really what's making them so reluctant to go with Ambulance?\" \n\nSusan shrugged.  \"Well, it's about a grand either way, so I can totally understand their reluctance. Hell, I barely go to the doctor myself. I can't pay that kind of money either. \" \n\nI stared at her, dumbfounded. \"Shit, A grand? We pay $60 and only if we're able to!\" \n\nShe only grimaced. \"Well, it's likely he doesn't have insurance, so that'd make it even more expensive. Given what you've told me about the work hours for the department you're applying for, and now this - there's suddenly a good case for moving to Canada\"\n\n  ~~~\n\nI can't name the officer who died that night without breaking the anonymity rules, but he remains in my thoughts, even though I never met him.  \n\nOn his behalf, for all the rest of us non-LEOs reading this forum, please remember to pull over when you see the flashing red and blue lights and please slow down when passing any traffic stops.  \n\nHe died when a truck plowed full into his parked, lit up patrol car, causing it to explode.  He had been about to go off duty, had been taking documents back to one of the main precincts, but had pulled over to help someone whose car had broken down. \n\nRIP Officer. ",
