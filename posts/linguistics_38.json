I find myself using:\n\n* Shorter vowels\n* Higher vowels\n* In some cases laxer vowels\n* Geminated consonants\n* Repeated consonant sounds\n* Vowels that are not normally part of my dialect, such as replacing /oʊ/ and /ɑ/ with [ɒ]\n\nDoes anyone have any information (or thoughts on their own baby talk)?",

        "text": "For one of my required classes a few semesters ago I took an African American Language course. It is still one of my favorite classes to date because I learned SO much about how I, and how 90% of those I know, speak. There are rules to how we talk. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is valid.I came across a few of the worksheets that I saved from the lectures in the course and decided to share:\n\nIn order to talk about the features of this language, I have to define a few key words that AAVE falls under, like lexicons, segmental phonology, and morphosyntax.\n\nLexicons are basically a mental dictionary of the vocabulary of a person/language. Some examples of lexicons include: \"casket-sharp\", \"grown\" (she acting grown), \"jawn\", \"mad\" (as an intensifier, like \"very\"), \"dead ass\", and \"hit-a-lick\".\n\nSegmental Phonology is the study of individual speech sounds. The phonological features found in AAVE are:\n\nrealization of  /ŋ/ (-ing sound) as [n]: examples -&gt; pronouncing something as somethin', length as lenth, running as runnin,  (This phenomenon is unlikely to happen with words that have just one syllable, like sing.)\n\nconsonant-cluster reduction (CCR):  this happens when two consonants that are next to each other in a word come together and are pronounced as one. This is most likely to happen when the two consonants are followed by a word beginning with a consonant, like, \"best practice\" would be \"bes practice\". Some other examples, mind as min (mine),and as an, desk as des. (Just earlier today I said, \"My hand hurts\", not even realizing that I didn't pronounce the d.)\n\nrealization of /θ/ (theta) as [f] or [t], in the middle of a word or at the end of one: examples -&gt; with pronounced as wif or wit, birthday as birfday.\n\nrealization of /ð/ (eth) as [d] (at the beginning of a word) or [v] (in the middle or end of a word): examples -&gt; [d] = them as dem, [v] = mother as muva.\n\n/r/ and /l/ vocalization/absence (never at the beginning of a word): examples -&gt; card as ca'd, cool as coo, and car as ca'.\n\n/aj/glide weakening -&gt; my as mah, ride as rahd (long \"a\").\n\npre /l/ merger of /ɪ/ and /ɛ/ -&gt; feel as fill, feelings as fillings.\n\nLast, but not least, we have morphosyntax, which is word, phrase, and sentence structure.\n\nabsence of plural suffix -s (this is a rare one) -&gt; The candy bar costs 75 cent, instead of cents.\n\nabsence of possessive -s suffix -&gt; She at her mom house, instead of she's at her mom's house.\n\nabsence of 3rd person singular present tense -&gt; she/he go, there go, it go... not goes. This also happens with, \"it seem like\" and \"she have\" instead of she has.\ndemonstrative them -&gt; Where you get them jeans, instead of those jeans.\n\nassociative plural -&gt; Theresa an 'em.\n\nexistential it -&gt; using it, where you could also use there is/are/were/was. \"its a bathroom down the hall\" or \"it ain't nothing you can do about it\".\n\nhabitual be, this is only used when something happens regularly -&gt; she be late, he be lying, I be chillin'. Habitual be can be negated with \"don't\" -&gt; He don't be late all the time. And can involve \"do\" for questions -&gt; Do he be late?\n\ncopula deletion -&gt; \"She doing alright\", instead of \"She is doing alright\",  \"they tired\", \"you crazy\", \"when you planning on going back?\" this cannot be used for the past tense -&gt; \"Back then, he tall\"\n\nleveling of the verb be -&gt; Present tense: what is these animals? Past tense: Someone called while you was out.\n\nmultiple negation -&gt; She ain't no fool, they don't know nothing about it, they ain't never been there.\n\nAAVE marks black identity as a symbol of culture and life-style, all while maintaining its identity as a valid way of speaking. It is not just slang.\n\nSuggested reading: Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English by John Russell &amp; Russell John Rickford.",

I thought that \"pretend\" was one of the definitions of the verb form of \"effect.\" How does one edit titles on this website?*\n\nI was watching *Queer Eye* the other day, and it was of course readily apparent that Tan had a non-American accent. But after a few minutes, I realized that Antoni didn't quite speak with a typical General American English accent, either. I noticed that his speech is almost entirely free from /æ/-tensing, which is present in much of GAE but absent from his speaking style. Listen to how he says the words \"pan,\" \"family,\" \"romantic,\" and \"Instagram,\" and you'll hear that the \"a\" in each is pronounced as the /æ/ in \"mat\" rather than as the \\[ɛə \\~ eə\\] in \"mare.\" Sure enough, Antoni grew up in Montreal.\n\nThis lack of /æ/-tensing always sticks out like a sore thumb to me; I can almost always tell when an actor on a US TV show or in a US film isn't originally from the US based on that sound alone. With the exception of some speakers from Hawaii or the world of theater, it only seems to me to be certain Australian, British, and Canadian actors and personalities who lack this tensing. Andrew Garfield shouting \"ambulance\" in *The Amazing Spider-Man*, the late Cory Monteith saying \"dancing\" and \"transfer\" on several episodes of *Glee* (ugh), Jacki Weaver repeating \"cancer\" in *The Disaster Artist,* half of the actors in *Iron Fist* pronouncing \"Danny Rand\" as /dæni rænd/ instead of \\[dɛəni rɛənd\\]—these were all moments that completely took me out of what I was watching.\n\nRant over! Now I'm going to turn the question to the community. **What's the most prominent sign, in your opinion, that an actor or personality in a US film/TV show doesn't have a native GAE accent—despite appearing on the show/in the film and/or playing a US American character? And who are the worst offenders?**\n\n*\\* Listen to how Neil Patrick Harris says \"naked man\" in the eponymous* How I Met Your Mother *episode or to how Lea Michele says \"plan\" in the* Glee *(ugh again) episode \"Vitamin D\" for prime examples of the \"theatrical\" accent.*",

One example is \"das Restaurant\", the restaurant.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/8xnte5/writing_a_book_about_meditation_i_have_a_section/",
        "text": "Hello Reddit. I am writing a book about meditation and one of the most important points that I need to explain to people is that meditation is about sensing the world through the 7 senses, but not with the analytical rational thinking mind. In order to explain how and why the modern human mind is constantly thinking (analysing, comparing, predicting, regretting, planning, worrying, etc) I have come up with a fictional story about the origin of language. It isn't supposed to be totally accurate, but it is supposed to show what language is, why we developed it, why it is useful, and ultimately why we have forgotten that the mind isn't reality as it actually is, why we have identified with the mind, and why we are so confused by concepts such as the ego. I need help though as I don't want to make any silly errors in my fictional little story. Can anyone here help with some constructive criticism? Thanks in advance :)\n\n  \nSo naturally, the next questions are:  \nIf I am not my thought, who or what am I?\n\nHow do I disidentify with my mind?\n\nBefore I answer those questions we need to understand what the mind is and how it works.\n\nImagine you are a pre-human hominid in a pristine jungle approximately 2 million years ago. You and your tribe are alive in a time before math and language. You communicate predominantly through emotions and body language. You can’t have a running commentary in your mind, as a running commentary requires language, which you do not possess or understand. You navigate the world through your senses, intuition and emotions. You feel, see, hear, smell and taste the world around you. Your mind works in images and not in words.\n\nNow, while you are reading this, try to analyse the world from that point of view. Take a moment to look around you and see if you can 30 seconds without a single word entering your mind. It’s difficult isn’t it? Now close your eyes and try again to just exist without thoughts for another 30 seconds. I am guessing that you found this exercise even more difficult with your eyes closed. Maybe you even found it frustrating or annoying or uncomfortable? This is the mind we humans have developed. It is almost always on - Barely controlled and compulsive thinking. The mind is judging, comparing, planning, regretting, imagining, jumping from thought to thought, never still. So why did we develop this mind and how did it become as dominant as it has become?\n\nReturn to the jungle in your mind. Imagine, while you are alone, you come across some fruit in the jungle and you can’t reach it or climb up to get it. You see a stick on the floor and you have the novel idea to use that stick to knock the fruit off the tree. It works! You return to the group and they are amazed. They wonder - How did you get that unreachable fruit? You have no words to explain how you got that fruit. You have no stick with you to show them what you did and you don’t have any word for stick. You can’t use body language as a stick is not part of your body and so it remains a mystery to the other members of your tribe. You can visualise what you did in your mind, but you can’t express anything verbally and so you can’t abstractly explain to others what to do if they also want to get the fruit, unless you bring them to the tree and show them through action. \n\nOur modern minds are tuned to see the world through symbols – letters, words, characters, and pictures. :) This emoji is an example of symbology. It is 2 dots and a curved arc which looks nothing like a real person, but yet we understand it instantly. It represents happiness or positive mood. The 2 dots represent human eyes and the curved arc represent a mouth with the corners turned up, indicating a smile. Through millennia of evolution and culture, our human brains are finely tuned to understand and process symbolic meaning. Abstract thinking is the ability to think about objects, principles, and ideas that are not physically present. It is related to symbolic thinking, which uses the substitution of a symbol for an object or idea. A variety of everyday behaviours constitute abstract thinking.\n\nBack to our homind friend. He is a very smart ape. He decides to create a sound that corresponds to the stick. He calles it – “Stick”. He gets a stick and brings it to the tribe. He points at it and says “Stick” over and over until some members of the group get the gist of what is going on. They also start correlating the sound “Stick” with the actual “Stick”. The smart ape tests them. He puts the stick a few meters away and says to the group, “Stick”. The other apes look confused as there is no stick in his hand this time. He continues, “stick, stick, stick”. Eventually one member of the group walks over to the stick and brings it back, holding it aloft. The smart ape gets very excited and the rest of the group seem to understand. He puts the stick a few meters away again and says “Stick”. This time, almost all of the group understand and they run over to the stick and bring it back. They have learned their first word. Now whenever someone in the tribe makes the sound “Stick”, even if there is no actual stick nearby, the sound will conjure an abstract conceptual image in their mind. They will be able to see a stick in their minds eye and understand the message another member of the group is trying to convey. This “stick” that they see in their mind, is an idea - It is not a stick in actuality. It is the concept of what the apes think a stick is. This ability to conceptualise bits of the world into abstract ideas is a huge advantage over other apes and species who are not capable of abstract thought. They can now draw a stick (Symbol), make the sound for a stick (Which is a linguistic symbol), and imagine a generic stick (Abstract conceptual thought) whenever they hear the sound “Stick” (Semiotics). Slowly the apes add other symbols and words to their vocabulary. They can now describe a few actions along with symbols too. The smart ape teaches the other apes the sound for “Hit”. They see that any time he performs a hitting action, he says “Hit”. Eventually the tribe can describe, with nothing other than linguistic symbols: Hitting the fruit in the tree with a stick so that it falls to the ground. Now that this tribe has created a language, any new knowledge can be conceptualised and the knowledge can then be passed along to the other members of the tribe very easily. All they have to do to understand and share the knowledge of the world is to create a conceptual symbol for every pattern they see in the world. Now, for example, if there is a snake in a tree nearby, instead of just emoting fear to alert the other members of the tribe through screeching and body language, an ape can inform the others more accurately, “There is a snake in that tall tree over there. Stay away from it”. \n\n  \nAs you can see symbols, ideas, concepts and language is very useful, and the knowledge it has unlocked has literally brought us from apes in the forest to the moon and back. But - and this is a big but - we have forgotten that this conceptual symbolic system we have developed, is not reality as it is in actuality. We have forgotten that the world is not what we \"think\" it is. We have forgotten that the world around us exists in an experiential non-conceptual form. We can see it. We can hear it. We can smell it. We can taste it. We can feel it. We can move about in it. We can do all of this without thinking about it. The symbols we have attached to the world around us have become more real to us than reality itself. Ideas, such as truth, fact, scientific, right, wrong, up, down are only concepts that exist in our individual and collective minds. They are useful concepts that share our knowledge and adjust our attitude and behaviour, but they do not exist outside of abstraction. This is the reality that has been lost. Mediation is about quietening the mind so that it can be once again recognised for what it is: A useful tool that we have developed. The majority of humanity now believes that they are the tool. They define themselves as the thoughts they have. They have forgotten that they exist even when they are not thinking. If I think I am my thoughts, then I have forgotten that the shared symbols that conceptualise the world are only shapes and sounds that describe observed patterns. A tree is an observed pattern. They look a certain way and they act in a certain way and so we can assign a conceptual idea to it. But what have we forgotten? We have forgotten almost everything. We have forgotten that the thing we call a tree is only a temporary pattern. We have forgotten that everything the tree is made of was in existence before there was a tree. We had to create the idea of time to assign continuity to the tree we see today and the tree we saw yesterday, even though it has changed slightly. Indeed, what we call a tree is in a constant state of change, as is everything else in existence. That tree is also inseparable from its environment. It cannot exist without the ground in which it grows its roots. It can't exist without the atmosphere. It can't exist without water present in the environment. Everything we label a tree as, creates an inaccurate concept in our minds that doesn't actually exist. We have forgotten all this. We are individuals. We are indivisible from everything else. Nothing is divisible from the whole in actuality because life is infinite change. \"You\" as you generally perceive yourself, are not who you were when you started reading this sentence. \"You\" have changed. You have new Oxygen molecules in your blood stream and you have food in your system that is being converted into \"You\". If your idea of you is constantly changing then how can your idea of yourself be accurate? You introduce another concept to explain it. Time. Time is only a concept as well. It is an arbitrary measure of speed over distance. It assumes a beginning and all it really measures is movement. How many ticks of a clock does it take for you to get to drive to the supermarket? Well, who decided the speed of which the clock ticks? Well that was decided by another pattern of moment: The speed at which the earth rotates and causes the night and day cycle and the yearly cycles. Again, all of this is a measurement of movement based on an assumed starting point: the concept of the big bang. This assumed starting point was created because we try to create new concepts to understand our other concepts. How can I be me if I look very different to how I looked when I was 5. If that 5 year old was me and I am still me now at 35, why do I look so different? Instead of understanding ourselves as life itself moving through ever-changing patterns, we created the concept of time to hold on to our mistaken identity as a mind encapsulated in a human body. This in turn created the question, \"What will happen to my mind when I die?\", and thus the mind also took on the mistaken identity of the everlasting soul. The soul (or life / existence / consciousness if you dislike spiritual language) was already there before the mind. It was witnessing through the senses. It was experiencing life phenomenologically. It didn't confuse ideas and concepts with reality. It simply witnessed itself through different perspectives. Our symbology has taken us to the moon and back. It has given us modern medicine. It has given me this computer that I am expressing myself on. It has given us incredible knowledge and power, but it has also hidden our true nature from ourselves. We ate from the tree of knowledge by dividing what is indivisible, and so we were cast out of the garden of Eden that was the world before conceptions. We observed impermanent patterns and lost ourselves by labelling them as permanent. A tree. A dog. Happiness. Hot. Big. Night. Not only did we lose touch with ourselves, we literally tore ourself apart, creating opposites out of implication. How can we label anything without also labelling everything else as not-that. If I call something a stick, then by extension everything that is not currently following that observed pattern is not a stick. It negates the possibility of change, when change is the only reality. Before there was symbolic language there was only existence - and even that word - \"existence\" captures the problem with language, because existence implies non-existence, which again creates division and separation where there is none. \n\n“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”   \n― **Heraclitus**",

        "text": "So, I speak Serbo-Croatian and you don't really need to know how to speak it to answer this question, I think. Anyways, in Serbo-Croatian, there is the past tense that is used most often, just like in other slavic languages. So, if I were to say that I loved, I would say \"volio sam\". Now, there are two archaic past tenses, the aorist which is exclusively for perfective verbs, and the imperfect which is exclusively for imperfective verbs. Now, the aorist is still used decently often, like people will still use it in everyday speech. The imperfect though is never used anymore, from what I've experienced. I personally think it's because the aorist rarely changes the stem ending while the imperfect usually does. Anyways, \"voljeti\" or to love is an imperfective verb, so the imperfect version of \"volio sam\" is \"voljah\". But I've seen a lot of people use \"voljeh\" which would be the aorist version, but that doesn't exist. I've seen people do it with \"ljubiti\"which also means to love or kiss and is imperfective. The correct past tense is \"ljubljah\" but a lot of people say \"ljubih\", which isn't the correct tense. I feel like people do this because it's easier to say ljubih instead of ljubljah, is this like an actual phenomenon in other languages? Thoughts?",

A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).\n\n**Commenting rules**\n\nThe rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics.

This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

        "text": "I moved from Massachusetts to Philadelphia for University and noticed a particularly interesting dialect feature that really stands out to me every time I hear it:\n\nInstead of saying, \"Are you done with the homework?\"\n\nSomeone might say, \"Are you done the homework?\"\n\nI find this so interesting because in my own dialect, if I wanted to remove the word 'with' in that sentence I would also have to replace 'Are' with 'Have' to make the sentence read, \"Have you done the homework?\" But here, they feel no such compulsion.\n\nTo my untrained ear, this feels like the mid-Atlantic (or maybe it's more localized to greater Philadelphia?) dialect is treating tense structure differently than I do or have heard in other varieties of American English.\n\nSo:\n\n1) What is actually happening here linguistically? \n\n2) Where historically might this feature have come from?\n\n3) Is this localized to Greater Philadelphia? The Mid-Atlantic? Are there other places this linguistic feature appears?\n\n4) Are there other languages that do similar things?\n\nThanks so much!",

Suppose you have American parents but you grow up in the UK, are you more likely to have some kind of American accent or British accent?  Would this change (would you start with an American accent until you start interacting with British children more often?).  Is there an age where your accent has pretty much settled and interaction with peers isn't likely to move it?",
