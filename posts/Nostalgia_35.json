It was a german (At least i think it was) browser gamer about a dragon and a few kids that were trying to stop him or something of sorts. I remember the levels being about math questions. I used to play it between 1st and 4th grade, so it should be at least 9+ years old.\nIf anyone remembers anything let me know, me and the boys are trying to find it so we can remember the \"\"good old days\"",
