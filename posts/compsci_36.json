The vertices are 2d points on the plane. Distance should use Manhattan metric. There's also a minimum edge distance. The title was also misleading - I'm interested in minimizing the longest edge rather than the total distance. Bottleneck TSP. \n\nGiven K sets vertices in R2  Pi = { x*_0_* , ... , x*_n_*} (for 0 &lt;= i &lt; k) I want a sequence of (a*_0_*, ... a*_n_*) such that \n\n   - for each j (0 &lt;= j &lt; n) across all Pi |x*_aj_*,x*_aj+1_*| &gt; A\n\n   - Let m*_i_* = max(|x*_a0_*,x*_a1_*|, ...  ,|x*_an-1_*,x*_an_*|) from Pi = { x*_0_* , ... , x*_n_*}. Minimize max (m*_0_*, ... m*_k-1_*)\n\nThe &gt; A constraint must be met. The maximum edge length could be minimized in a way that's approximate. Total edge length is also better lower than higher. \n\nMy first though was to do successive nearer neighbour searches of distance &gt; A from P on each graph. Until some candidate was found in every graphs candidate set of \"nearest n neighbours of distance &gt; A from P\" n would increase. Once a vertex was found to be shared in each graphs nearest neighbour candidate set P would be removed from the graphs and that shared candidate would become the new P. This would not work very well however and would make long paths once the nodes began to be exhausted. \n",

        "text": "Hi, I’m present a software engineer( computer science graduate). I feel I have quite some time left after work which I want to devote to learning some good new distributed systems.  Been looking at Kubernetes and memcached (other suggestions also welcomed) projects. I’ve never really worked on open source before. \nCould someone enlighten me about the process of participating in a project like how do we reach out to the moderators, are there any prerequisite projects you need to have in your profile to be able to pick up those projects, etc. How does this whole setup works? Who comes up with the problem definition? How can one target to present at certain good conferences or get to collaborate with other research folks? I missed out on this important opportunity in my graduate school but I feel it’s not too late(roughly two years of work experience). And I’m determined to do so. Just need some guidance to get started. Thanks in advance :)",
