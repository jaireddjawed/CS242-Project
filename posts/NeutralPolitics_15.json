        "text": "[Business Insider claims](http://www.businessinsider.com/felix-sater-confirms-trump-pursued-deal-with-sanctioned-russian-bank-2018-3) ([archive](https://archive.is/66x4F)):\n\n&gt; VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, was initially added to the US's Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN) in July 2014, which froze its assets in the country and restricted US citizens and companies from doing business with VTB and its subsidiaries. The US later imposed additional sanctions on VTB in December 2015.\n\n[This claim seems to be echoed by wikipedia also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTB_Bank#History) ([archive](https://archive.is/LKgeA)):\n\n&gt; 29 July 2014: the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) published that VTB Bank OAO, which is the second largest bank in Russia, together with its subsidiaries (“the VTB Group”) and the Bank of Moscow through its parent bank, VTB Bank OAO, and other entities have been added to the Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN). This freezes the assets in the United States of VTB, VTB Global, Bank of Moscow, and other entities; and blocks any United States citizen or entities from conducting business with VTB, VTB Global, Bank of Moscow, and other entities.\n\nThe two treasury.gov citations for this on wikipedia is:\n\n - [​Announcement of Additional Treasury Sanctions on Russian Financial Institutions and on a Defense Technology Entity](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2590.aspx) ([archive](https://archive.is/smTTo))\n - [Sectoral Sanctions Identifications; Kingpin Act Designations; Iran Designations Update; Ukraine-related Designation](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20140729.aspx) ([archive](https://archive.is/4OTvq))\n\nThe first does not say anything about SDN list - the second does include some entities under \"*The following entities have been added to OFAC's SDN List:*\" - but VTB is not one of them. VTB is listed under \"*The following entities have been added to OFAC's Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List:*\". AFAIU OFAC SSI is not the same as OFAC SDN.\n\nI have also looked at https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=6570 ([archive](https://archive.is/mQRLz)) - again here it is listed as ~~non-SSI~~ Non-SDN - and the sanctions that apply are:\n\n&gt; Executive Order 13662 Directive Determination Subject to Directive 1\n\nThis directive can be found here: [Directive 1 as Amended Under Executive Order 13662 (Issued September 12, 2014)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/eo13662_directive1.pdf) ([archive](https://archive.is/DQa01)) (note there is also a newer version of directive 1 from 2017 but that is not relevant I guess).\n\nThe gist of it seems to be (it is only one page total):\n\n&gt; the following activities by a U.S. person or within the United\nStates are prohibited, except to the extent provided by law or unless licensed or otherwise\nauthorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control: (1) all transactions in, provision of financing\nfor, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 30 days maturity or new equity of persons\ndetermined to be subject to this Directive, their property, or their interests in property; and (2) all\nactivities related to debt or equity issued before the date of this Directive 1 (as amended) that\nwould have been prohibited by the prior version of this Directive 1. All other activities with\nthese persons or involving their property or interests in property are permitted, provided such\nactivities are not otherwise prohibited pursuant to Executive Orders 13660, 13661, or 13662 or\nany other sanctions program implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nFurther, from wikipedia entry for \"additional sanctions on VTB in December 2015\":\n\n&gt; 22 December 2015: United States imposed additional sanctions on VTB Bank and its subsidiaries.\n\nCitations here are:\n\n - [Treasury Sanctions Individuals and Entities for Sanctions Evasion and Other Activities Related to Russia and Ukraine](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0314.aspx) ([archive](https://archive.is/XXtiy))\n\n  this one does not mention any new sactions for VTB bank - just mention sanctions for VTB linked entities.\n\n &gt; OFAC also identified a number of subsidiaries that are owned 50 percent or more by the previously-designated VTB Bank, Sberbank, and Rostec.\n &gt; ...\n &gt; Today, OFAC also identified a number of subsidiaries of VTB Bank, Sberbank, and Rostec as being owned 50 percent or more by their respective parent entities. [...] These identifications will help the public more effectively comply with the sanctions on VTB Bank, Sberbank, and Rostec.\n\n - [Russia/Ukraine-related Sanctions and Identifications](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20151222.aspx) ([archive](https://archive.is/4drmI))\n\n  This lists VTB linked entities under \"The following entities have been added to OFAC's Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List:\"\n\n  &gt; [multiple names] (Linked To: VTB BANK OAO).\n\n - [Executive Order -- Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine ~ March 20, 2014](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/20/executive-order-blocking-property-additional-persons-contributing-situat) ([archive](https://archive.is/3UIim))\n\n  This is EXECUTIVE ORDER 13662 is the EO under which VTB was sanctioned in the first place in 2014.\n\nSo AFAICT *DIRECTIVE 1 UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 13662* is only sanctions that was relevant to them and they were not on SDN list. But I am asking here to confirm if this is in fact the case. It seems like Business Insider just copied from Wikipedia without checking if Wikipedia is in fact correct.\n\nFurther, what exactly is being prohibited by directive 1? Is this prohibition of lending money to the bank or borrowing money from the bank?\n\nEDIT 1: Added something regarding claims of additional sanctions in 2015.\n\nEDIT 2: Added archive links for other things.\n\nEDIT 3: VTB is also not in the actual [OFAC SDN list](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or in any of the [changes from 2013 onwards](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/archive.aspx)\n\nEDIT 4: From the original announcement of sanctions [Announcement of Additional Treasury Sanctions on Russian Financial Institutions and on a Defense Technology Entity\n](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2590.aspx)\n\n&gt; As a practical matter, this step will severely limit these banks’ access to medium- and long-term U.S. dollar financing, and will impose additional significant costs on the Russian Government for its continued activities in Ukraine.\n\nTo me this seems to indicate the prohibited action is to lend money to the bank, and not to borrow money from the bank - but again - I'm very unclear about this.",

Both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.\n\n\n\n&gt;The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability.  As the OPR proposal stated, ‘all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand.’ \n\n\n&gt;Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department’s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.”\n\n\n[Here is McCabe's statement](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/mccabe-fired-statement-fbi-deputy-director/index.html) criticizing the decision:\n\n\n&gt;I have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time.\n\n\n&gt;For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The President's tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us.\n\n\n&gt;No more.\n\n\n&gt;The investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\n\n\n&gt;The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\n\n\n&gt;But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.\n\n\n&gt;Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday's comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.\n\n\n&gt;This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.\n\n\n&gt;I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was privileged to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.\n\n\n&gt;I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred.\n\n\n",

Some economists assert that today's crazed housing prices are caused by [misguided governmental interventions like rent control](https://sf.curbed.com/2017/11/3/16603900/rent-control-san-francisco-stanford-study-gentrification), [NIMBYism](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/ways-affordable-housing-developers-deal-with-nimbys) and unnecessarily draconian [land-use restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/opinion/housing-regulations-us-economy.html). \n\nHowever, scholars like Richard Ronald and Carolin DeWilde, while not affirmatively denying the above, point to an element more foundational. They assert that the increasing marketization of housing since the 1970s and 1980s has [greatly exacerbated problems associated with affordable housing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314474164_Why_Housing_Wealth_and_Welfare). They point to a broad trend of hands-off government approaches to housing, privatizing social housing throughout Europe (and [demolishing public housing in the U.S.](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35913577)), policies that push homeownership backed by financial instruments and underwritten by [speculative investors with weak community ties](https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/feb/28/un-report-lays-bare-the-waste-of-treating-homes-as-commodities) and the utilization of [increased housing wealth](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/homeownership-and-the-failures-of-asset-based-welfare/) as a justification for rolling back state welfare provision to the middle and working classes. \n\nThey state: \"The increased policy focus on, and use of, housing as an investment asset has compromised access to decent and affordable housing through processes such as privatization of the public housing stock; new urban strategies aimed at enabling the mobilization and circulation of global capital, such as institutional investment in private rental housing... welfare cuts and austerity measures... and greater spatial segregation and concentration of wealth.\" (pp 20-21)\n\nIs there counter-evidence to suggest that the increasing commodification of housing leads to a more equitable provision of affordable housing? Is the premise of increasing commodification even accurate? Is the solution to our present housing crisis simply [\"build, baby, build\"](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/06/15/why-more-housing-won-make-boston-much-cheaper/c2KkCWS38hCARymiaNvQyM/story.html) or are more fundamental reforms required?",

However the authoritarian control they have means they can be quite effective for such a large country in implementing any changes such as environmental based policies or clamping down on corruption. Censorship and constant control can stifle knowledge and new ideas, however also help keep from having to deal with large internal conflict over how to progress or going back and forth in policies or trying to cater to public for votes.\n\nIf we consider things from a more 'common/greater good' of humanity or the people in general as opposed to what we 'ideally should have' with freedoms and access.

For example, [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/country/NGA) ranks Nigeria 148/180 on its Corruption Perception Index with a score of 27/100 where a lower score indicates more corruption. 69% of surveyed Nigerians claim that \"most or all police officials are corrupt,\" according to [Afrobarometer](http://www.afrobarometer.org/countries/nigeria-0).\n\n[USNews](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2018-03-07/nigerias-parliament-passes-anti-money-laundering-law) (I am not sure of the validity of this source; they refer to Nigeria's National Assembly as a Parliament?) reports that Nigeria passed an anti money-laundering act today that gives its financial intelligence unit more autonomy.\n\nMy questions are: \n\n**What effects did this new law intend to have on the levels of corruption plaguing Nigeria?\nAdditionally, overall, what policies can the Nigerian government implement to help reduce the levels of corruption within their government? What role do supranational organizations such as the UN play in fighting these problems?**",
