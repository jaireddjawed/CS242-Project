I'm coming across contradictory information online, so I thought you might be able to help me find the right answer.\n\nBasically, I'm trying to discern what the correct balance (if there is such a thing) between carbohydrates and fats intake has to be. Common wisdom I've come across seems to suggest that an appropriate balance would have to be something like 50% carbos and 30% fats (exact proportions may vary, but generally sources seem to suggest more carbohydrates than fat). However, should that be certain, I am unaware as to whether that proportion refers to the quantity of food in grams, or to the calories, since 30% fat would represent more calories than 50% of carbohydrates.\n\nDon't know whether I got to make myself clear, but I am really puzzled and can't seem to find a solution. I mean, I wouldn't want to demonize fats either; if the source of calories does not matter all that much, I guess getting more fats would be okay.",

I'm really curious about this idea that the body has a preferred weight where it is comfortable, and that it will largely revert to that weight even after periods of weight gain or weight loss. \n\nAnecdotally, I'm sure we can all think of people we know who eat intuitively and basically maintain exactly the same bodyweight for years on end. Conversely, there are some people who go to huge efforts to diet to gain or lose weight and then end up going back to where they started. \n\nSome people also report signficant increases in hunger and appetite when in even a slight calorie deficit, and a strong fullness response when overeating.\n\nBut I've never seen any real scientific evidence about this. What are your thoughts? \n\nThanks!",

If I have a choice between pearled barley or white pasta, is pearled barley still a better option because of the nutrient profile OR does it not make much of a difference since at the end of the day neither are whole grains?",

We offer them as a normal vegetable e.g., steamed, roasted, grilled. Sometimes he eats them, but most of the time it's a no. \n\nThere are a lot of recipes for muffins and pancakes that use grated sweet potatoes, beets, zucchini, etc. and I'm wondering if vegetables this way count and are still a good source of nutrition. I'm making an effort to go with recipes that are lower in sugar if that makes a difference.",

I love cooking and am really curious to know more about what certain foods contain and how these substances affect the body. I know there is a lot to learn in the internet but for me books are the most effective way of acquiring knowledge( I am aware that this differs a lot for different people). Its also fine if the book is a bit thicker or hard to read I like to take my time. It just needs to be filled with useful information. Thank you very much in advance!",
