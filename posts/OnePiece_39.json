Think it would be wild if somehow Kid manages to back down and join the Red Hair empire. \n\nAs we approach endgame the emperor crews are getting absolutely stacked and everyone is allying up in ways that we have not expected before. \n\nObviously it seems out of Kid‚Äôs nature as he has the conquerors haki and has been portrayed along with Luffy and Law to be members of the Worst Generation who want to remain as captains. \n\nBut if we consider someone like Yamato being added to the Straw hat fleet, that is atleast 3 confirmed members who have conquerors haki. We also know that the Red Hair pirates members all gained prominence by themselves before joining Shanks crew, and they are said to have the most well balanced crew with the highest average bounty. \n\nOnce again, it seems unlikely given Kids personality type but just want to say that this doesn‚Äôt seem impossible considering that they are facing off. Kid is not about to defeat Shanks. Where is he gonna go afterwards that man is surrounded by other Red hair subordinates.",

Oda has always loved his number puns and I'm fairly certain this was even brought up in an SBS one time.  \n\n\nBut that got me wondering, The ships full name is the thousand sunny go, 1325. So I'm wondering if there's a way to read 1325 in Japanese that can mean something different than just the number, kind of the reverse of what people did with the fruits. I don't know enough about Japanese to know the different ways to say numbers so I'm curious if anyone else knows anything.",

        "text": "In the last chapter, we saw that Kidd was on his way to challenge Shanks. Now, Kidd is not always the sharpest tool in the shed, and he can definitely get cocky, but I don't think that he actually thinks that his crew can defeat Shanks' crew. Without getting too uch into powerscaling, Kidd and Law together just managed to defeat Big Mom by ringout when we last saw him fight, and Shanks alone is probably somewhere around her level. I don't think that he has gotten much stronger since then, and the only other somewhat strong fighter we have seen in Kidd's crew (strong in the context of challenging a yonkou crew) is Killer, while Shanks' crew has been said to contain a small group of powerhouses. Now, it may be possible that Kidd has some trick up his sleeve such as a special weapon, help from a third part we haven't seen yet, or maybe he knows some weakness of Shanks, but I don't think that Kidd is about to fight Shanks head on. I think that just maybe, Kidd will challenge Shanks to a Davy Back fight. I have absolutely no arguments to support this claim, but I do think that another Davy Back fight will take place again in the story some time. What do you think? Also, this may be break week getting the better of me.",

The defeat of both him and Kaido must've left a huge void on the black marked.\n\nMany weapon dealers lost their supplier and sea stone is also a very desirable material for many parties, especially the World Government, since it's one of the key materials for building Marine ships. The World Government probably has other sources for obtaining sea stone, but buying it from Orochi was probably a reliable way to obtain it in large quantities, since sea stone is so plentiful in Wano.\n\nI wonder if the manga will ever adress this.

We have seen so far that every single Yonko they needed at least that much to become one (exception Buggy and we don't know about Blackbeard). I am not saying having adv CoC you will be come the strongest but that put you on a list of elite fighters and if you combine this skill with DF or other Haki types or martial arts you reach a huge level of power...\n\n¬∑ On the other hand the Admirals( including also Aokiji in this discussion) from what we have seen so far, they rely too much in their DF. Probably this because everyone of them have a logia type (exception Fujitora)which I must say that gives them an incredible boost in their attacking power . But the real question is do they also need Advanced CoC to match a user of one??? Or the attacking power of a logia type is the same as one imbued with CoC ?? Also if they have Adv. CoC how do they use it in combination with their DF or they just using it only in close combat?? From these questions I have the felling that maybe Yonkos are a bit stronger if the Admiral rely only on their DF fruit but then again maybe I am wrong and a logia DF attacking power is same as one with CoC....Also if they truly only rely on their DF couldn't Law be also an Admiral level (if he also learns Future sight and Ryou , he will become unstoppable)",

When Sabo tells Luffy his dream I feel like Luffy did what most kids do when you're young you try to one up them to beat them. Sabo says \"I wanna see the world and write a book about it\" Luffy would try to one up him, and whats greater than exploring the world? Well Outer Space.\n\nAlso I cant find the quote, but I remember hearing Oda stating he couldn't draw any detail on the panels where Roger and his crew arrive on Laughtale or it would give it away and because of that I think Laughtale is in Space or on the moon. \n\nIf his dream is too explore space, its a kids fantasy because currently they don't have anywhere near the technology to even do that since One Piece is set in the Pirate level era.\n\nWhich explains everyone's reactions.\n\nUsopp continually says that its not possible and that Luffy can't be serious.\n\nFranky loves it because hes all about technology so he'd love to rise to the challenge to modify the Thousand Sunny to be able to space travel.\n\nEven the Thousand Sunny's reaction is like how the heck am i supposed to get to outer space/ other planets. lol\n\nEveryone else is caught off guard and laughs because who even thinks of something like that. If in our world someone during the 1500s said I wanna explore space, they would most likely be laughed at. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccqgm4qo9tka1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1119b217e77b684212477efe9ecf9a6db9bf618f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idzzjfmr9tka1.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f012edc9271acf598e64cc04bd6fda6a379a5998\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4tcdhxk9tka1.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb3c10a06d912683e80afe9342fb5fd469799605",

Nobody knows what happenned at god valley, either rocks found what he was looking for or didnt, and purposefully or was forced to disapear/fake his death by the arrival of gold roger helping the marines. god valley being a secret celestial dragon island, this is obviously where garp saw things that disgusted him from the people he was protecting. Xebec leaving his crewmates behind, to go on his quests of finding the best devil fruits for his plan, the first stone being finding the yami yami no mi. i think black beard live with rocks soul within him, thats why he seems to have more knowledge about devil fruits and souls and doesnt sleep, because when he was 16 and being an orphan he already knew everything and just lived his life waiting for the yami yami no mi to show up to him. (xebec's fruits, knows that the fruit is fatefully attracted to him). to me blackbeard was the product of xebec's experiment and his chalice after god valley incident. (an orphan kid with vegapunk level of knowledge and evil plan). i wouldnt be surprised if he moved to another body later (maybe a rocks clone or a preserved corpse) to have strongest body on top of his powers (and become the three skulls), probably why he is making a heist gang. what do you guys think about it ?",

        "text": "Hey dudes dudettes and non birarudes, more a discussion than a theory but let‚Äôs talk\n\nChapter 838 cover story had Shanks and his crew or rather at least a few of them at a ‚ÄúWedding on a certain ruined island‚Äù \n\nA popular thought at the time was that he was on Elbaf, considering the most eligible bachelor at the time was Loki \n\nNow, considering the most recent chapter Elbaf was titled ‚ÄúWarland‚Äù, and the theorised Adam tree was set to be around war and war like people \n\nAnd let‚Äôs face it the Giants are a bunch of war faring chads and chadettes\n\nCould this really be true?\n\nI‚Äôm thinking it is, but let me know if you‚Äôre opinion have changed or remained the same or  have a different idea \n\nThat being said , if it was Elbaf how long has Shanks had ties there?\n\n\nChapter 633 Cover story had Dorry and Brogy still fighting on Little Garden, that was during Fishman Island \n\nThe latest chapter they refer to Shanks as brother, did he meet them and let‚Äôs extend it to the rest Elbaf post this fight \n\nI mean they fought for a century, so either:\n\n‚Ä¢ he met them on LG ala straw hats, and went on his way \n\n‚Ä¢ or met them after \n\nEither way how Shanks has this tie and seemingly Elbaf with him has me thinking how long has he had this card under his belt\n\nWhat are your thouhh",

        "text": "This should be fun. One Piece is very obviously left-leaning politically. The enemy is a totalitarian dictatorship and a military-industrial complex, the revolutionary army are anarchists or at the very least socialists, and the monarchy is constantly questioned (yes, Dressrosa and Alabasta have kings again, but only after they prove they put the people first, which is very leftist). There's also slavery and blatant discrimination, which is constantly shown to be horribly negative and dehumanizing (defishmanizing), which are leftist ideals in case the current discourse about trans rights hasn't made that clear. Also, Luffy wants everyone to be free to pursue their dreams and literally wants everyone to have as much food as they can eat. People have made post after post and essay after essay describing the leftist politics of One Piece. I am a leftist, pretty damn far left, and these aspects make me love the series so much more. So I'm genuinely asking, not to be a dick or \"get\" anyone, but how do you watch or read a series that does not like your views?",
