I don't even know where to begin, but my goal is to compile a list of interesting codes used in biology, like how Stephen Wolfram catalogued the various rules for generating some cellular automata.

        "text": "This is not meant to be a hot topic or anything. After what I‚Äôve learned about biology and numerology(which at the end of the day is very rudimentary) I‚Äôve come to an understanding that humans are not really separated from animals. We may have technology and things or the sort, but I have many arguments as to why we are still just tech-savvy apes. For starters the humans biggest advantage isn‚Äôt language, intelligence, or tool use. It is the ability to write down the informal for later generations and the continuing of said knowledge. Many other animals are arguably more intelligent, dexterous, or even emotional. While I agree we have separated ourselves from the animal kingdom in a technological sense and that because of that we have, in a sense, guided our own evolution. Is there anything biologically speaking that has made us so unique from the animal kingdom, or hav we as a species just been incredibly lucky to have had so many genetic traits and line up in a way to make us such a dominant species. I‚Äôve always been a bit biased in the sense that I believe we were a lucky species, with a lucky evolutionary history in addition to a lucky cultural development, but I was wondering if there was a better explanation than a statistical anomaly, or if we are just a very specific niche that will eventually fade?",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI've been reading up on voltage-gated sodium channels for a paper I'm hoping to write for class. However, I'm just a bit confused in terms of its structure.\n\nA sodium channel has one alpha subunit and one or two beta channels. Yet, there are several genes that code for different alpha subunit and beta subunit proteins. Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but is there a mix-and-match situation going on? Do different genes code for different subunits meaning not all voltage-gated sodium channels are the same? Or are all vg sodium channels the same?\n\nFor instance, a sodium channel has one alpha and two beta subunits. This alpha subunit is encoded by geneSCN4A (protein Nav1.2). The two beta subunits are encoded by geneSCN2B (protein NavŒ≤2) and geneSCN4B (protein NavŒ≤4). Another sodium channel looks like SCN9A (Nav1.70), SCN1B (NavŒ≤1), and SCN4B (NavŒ≤4). Is this how this works or am I completely incorrect?\n\nAny help is greatly welcomed!\n\nThank you!",

So hypothetically, if someone who had Neanderthal DNA had a child with someone who ALSO had Neanderthal DNA, would the child have DOUBLE the amount of Neanderthal DNA than their parents? And if so, if the tradition were to continue where the offspring had a child with someone who had the same amount of Neanderthal DNA as them for a couple hundred thousand - million years nonstop, would that hypothetically be able to produce a child that is almost 100% Neanderthal and be able to bring them back?\n\n\nThis just randomly popped in my head because I love to watch documentaries about human evolution and other human species",

        "text": "I am confused about how the muscle cell prioritizes its energy resources. In a fasted state, I assume a muscle will first consume its local glycogen. Because we're in a fasted state, glucagon levels will be high which will trigger gluconeogenesis and the activation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. This will increase blood glucose and fatty acid (FA) levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, is it true that glycogen is the first energy source a myocyte turns to in the fasted state? Second, assuming the myocyte's local glycogen is used up, how does it prioritize to use FA or glucose (or is there no prioritization)? Does high HSL and low insulin (so less GLUT transporters in myocyte membranes) naturally favor FA uptake and metabolism? Or is there no prioritization of FA and glucose metabolism in the fasted state? (this would be surprising and interesting)  \n\n\nAre there any medications being developed/researched to potentiate FA metabolism while in a fasted state? Are there any obvious pitfalls in developing agonists for FA transporters or FA metabolic enzymes?",

        "text": "\nSo we know that because females are born with their eggs, over time these eggs undergo mutations. Unlike men who can always make fresh sperm. Hence it's why much more dangerous for women to give birth at old ages as there is a higher chance of their child getting a disease such as autism. The probability of a child having autism exponentially increases with the age of the mother.\n\nBut I recently learned from  Dr. Nathan that because sperm undergo more cell divisions this also increases their chances of mutations. Since more cell divisions = more chance of mutations.\n\nSo then is the mother or the father that has a higher chance of passing on mutations at an old age? Is the egg or the sperm?",
