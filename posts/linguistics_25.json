        "text": "Thanks for all of you who were helpful in answering my previous question. I love this community and might start asking questions regularly on here now.\n\nI was wondering why Latin verbs (infinitives in *-are*, *-ere*, *-ire*), when borrowed into English, often takes the suffixes (*-ate*, *-ete*, *-ite*), as in Eng. *locate* &lt; Lat. *locare*, Eng. *delete* &lt; Lat. *delere*, and Eng. *expedite* &lt; Lat. *expedire*. I thought that a sound change /r/ &gt; /t/ would be a bit strange (and also won't be a good explanation as such a sound change would only affect the verb endings, and nowhere else), so that won't be it. After looking into it, I realized that it's because English borrowed the past participle forms of the Latin verbs (*locatus*, *deletus*, *expeditus*).\n\nSo that answers one question but brings up another. Why would English take the Latin past participles as its own present tense? Why would English not take the Latin verb's present infinitive, or something else?\n\nIf any of you know the answer, please help me out; I greatly appreciate any responses. Thank you, everyone.",

So the other day I was in Latin class and someone translated a latin verb in the imperfect future to a present verb in Spanish; my teacher noticed the change, and said it wasn’t really wrong because apparently the future tense is disappearing in Spanish. Someone also pointed out how new learners are taught the construction “ir a+verb” (like “going to+verb”) instead of the future tenses. \n\nIs this an actual, recorded phenomenon? And if so, are there any papers you could recommend to read deeper into it? It doesn’t need to be about Spanish specifically, just certain tenses not being used anymore.",

        "text": "Recently I've been really interested in how English may change typologically. Us English speakers have a pretty conservative writing system, so modern linguistic innovations are not written down, nor does the way we write reflect how we speak in any capacity. This can inhibit the changes we have made in our speech from being recognized or recorded in the linguistic community. I'm wondering has English changed its analytic status, or is it in the midst of a change. From by personal observations, I have noted that many clitics are used, such as in \"won't\", \"you've\", and \"I'm\". Furthermore, many word pairs are shortened, such as \"going to\" to \"gonna\", \"give me\" to \"gimme\", and \"would of\" to \"woulda\". Third person  object pronouns have their first consonant removed when preceded by a word that ends in a consonant, such as \"love her\" to \"love er\", \"hate him\" to \"hate im\", and \"beat them\" to \"beat em\". Could any of this mean that English is slowly beginning its path to agglutination, or that it is overthrowing the older satellite framing system with a verb framing system? What are your thoughts?",

        "text": "Firstly, I want to emphasize, I am not going to regard feral children as good subjects to draw evidence from. Feral children are a complex issue, sociologically and psychologically; the unique trauma and effects of isolation on a social animal cannot be overlooked.\n\nOne of my main grievances with the CPH and certain ideas regarding L2 acquisition is the neurological component. Neurology in the last couple of decades has revealed iconoclastic rehabilitation in patients with traumatic head injuries and revolutionary developments regarding neuroplasticity and adult neurogenesis via neural stem cells.\n\nTwo variables that I think are often overlooked with regards to the CPH and its criticism are adult lifestyle and exposure to L1. Children start learning a language from an early age, spending nearly five years, listening and imitating in order to develop a basic understanding of a language. Adults on the other hand, spend a good portion of their time using their L1 while distracted by their life. I have yet to read a study about an adult who completely isolated themself from their L1 in an L2 speaking culture for half a decade, spending their time listening and imitating the L2 speaking natives.^(1)\n\nOne common argument against imitation is that it can't create distinctions between word boundaries. I don't think this should matter. If a child (or adult) has spent a long time listening, the string of sounds, /...zafəjuksilon.../, may become words (or syntactic or semantic segments of words in agglutinative languages) when /...polutjuksilab.../ and /...wanjuksilti.../ have also been previously heard in a similar context. /juksil/ may develop meaning when a all the contexts related to dogs in some way.^(2)\n\n**I want hear other people's opinion to my alternative hypothesis and its weak points.**\n\n1. When I speak of imitation, I mean real imitation, trying to match sounds right down to the volume, tonal quality, and pitch. I think many people develop accents as a result of treating L2 words like they would L1 words. Eg. An English speaker learning French might pronounce \\[i\\] the English way, without trying to match the sound qualities perfectly. They would need to clear their mind, stop any thoughts in L1 from going through their head and think in abstracted concepts while learning L2.\n2. The brain is remarkably good at extrapolation. Even if /juksil/ has only been used in the context of a non-specific dog around the listener, if the listener has heard /tazbil/ used to refer to a non-specific cat in the present tense and /tazbuk/ to refer to *the* cat, /juksuk/ would be a natural guess for a definite form of the indefinite /juksil/. It's the reason that children make the mistake \"meese\" when attempting to pluralize \"moose\".",

Unreal past can't have its own absolute tense (past subjunctive referring to the present or the future and past perfect subjunctive referring to the past just as present indicative refers to the present and past indicative refers to the past) because then\n\n1- She wished she were a butterfly at that time\n\nWould make as little sense as\n\n2- She thought she is a butterfly at that time\n\nSo, the referred time of unreal past is relative, but relative to what? Davtyan says if is relative to the predicate verb of the principal clause of the sentence, and so past subjunctive is such as to be at the same time as the predicate verb of the principal clause and past perfect subjunctive is such as to be at a time prior to it.\n\nBut this does not work in\n\n3- she was so upset that she could not be happy (at that time) if Charlie Chaplin were alive and came up to her to cheer her up.\n\nSo it requires type 3 conditional rather type 2 (she was so upset that she couldn't have been happy if Charlie Chaplin had been alive and had come up to her). So all this in view, what exactly is it that determines the referred time of unreal past in a sentence?",

I'm curious in the history of the early Germanic languages, and have tried to write a step-for-step phonological history of Dutch, going back to late Proto-Germanic, based on the [English phonological history page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English).  \nBut so far, I've only found a few resources.  \n  \n**For Frankish**, Wiktionary so far provides a resource and some lemmas of Frankish on their [About](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:About_Frankish) page, but there aren't really any cited sources, and the sound shifts might seem to be in conflict with the [German Wikipedia page on Frankish](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Altfränkische_Sprache&amp;oldid=179326992) at times. And the [English Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_language) doesn't offer much help besides lemmas. There also seems to be [an old book](https://archive.org/details/altfrnkischegram00fran/page/n3) about Frankish, but aside from these four resources, there is practically nothing written about the earliest phase of the Franconian dialects. Not much especially, about sound shifts. Are there more? Why is there so few information - shouldn't it be easier to reconstruct Frankish, because of the excellent reconstructions of Proto-Germanic and the attestations of Old Dutch, northwestern Old High German and Old French?  \n  \nRegarding **Proto-Norse**, there seem to be even less resources. [Wikipedia's page on Proto-Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Norse_language) provides a general overview, and [the page on the phonological history of *English*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English#Northwest_Germanic_period), regarding the Northwest Germanic period, provides a little more. Luckily, [Johan Schalin's Tcoimom Suntuubi site](http://tcoimom.suntuubi.com/?cat=4), provides actual paradigms with a few citations. But I'm still wondering why there isn't more. Are there any more resources on Proto-Norse, especially on the sound shifts and morphological/grammatical changes?  \n  \n**TL:DR;** I'm unable to find many resources for Frankish and Proto-Norse, but interested if there are any more.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/9jomxj/temporal_relativity_of_subjunctive_mood_in_english/",
        "text": "Good evening everyone. My understanding of linguistics is too limited to call myself a linguistic, so in case I use wrong technical terms, I apologise in advance. Also, as a non native English speaker, there might be some flaws of deficiencies in my understanding of English concerning subjunctive mood but independent of this particular question\n\nNow, since the use of past in subjunctive mood (were, could, had been, etc.) does not indicate pastness on the part of the tense of the sentence ( that if I had money, I would buy that car doesn't have to take place in the past), the tense of the subjuctive mood is dependent on the main verb. If it has a perfect element (by this I mean had been, could have been, would have done, and so on), the time of the subjunctive mood is prior to the main verb; and if it does not have a perfect element ( by this I mean, were, did, could, would, and so on), then the time of the subjunctive mood is the same as the main verb. So according to this, the following can be deciphered as shown below the examples\n\n1- I wish I were a kid\n\n2- I wished I were a kid\n\n3- I wish I had been a kid\n\n4- I wished I had been a kid\n\nIn 1, the unreal being a kid is at the same time as my wishing in the present; in 2, the unreal being a kid is at the same time as my wishing in the past; in 3, the unreal being a kid is at a time prior to my wishing at the present; and finally in 4, the unreal being a kid is at a time prior to my wishing in the past\n\nNow I am fairly sure I've got it right so far, and it is the same logic in unreal conditionals. For example we cannot say\n\n5- if she were ill two days ago, she would visit the nearby pharmacy\n\nBecause as it is, it being two days ago refers to the past but \"were\" refers to the present as not, as it were, modified by a past main verb. It would however be correct to say\n\n6- it was true two days ago that if she were ill, she would visit the nearby pharmacy\n\nIt is true, because its being true is in the past and since the main verb is in the past, the unreal conditional as tenseless in principle but dependent on the past main verb (was) refers to the past because connected to a past main verb. Now this is what I don't get\n\n7- she was so ill that she would have called a friend (if she could have reached the phone)\n\n8- she was so ill that she would call a friend (if she could reach the phone)\n\n7 is correct while 8 is wrong. My question is why? Why can we not apply the same logic of 2, or 6, to 8 and say even though the unreal calling a friend is in the past, since the main verb (was) refers to the past, the subjunctive mood in 8 should as in 2 and 6 also refer to the same past time as when she was ill; and accordingly 7 refers to a past time prior to the time when she was ill. But from my experience listening to natives, there is, as it were, a temporal disconnection between her being ill and her unreal calling a friend, and so for the subjunctive mood to refer to the past, a perfect element must be included as in 7. It is as if the speaker's mind focuses on the past when it is said that she was ill (because the tense is simple past) and when it gets to the subjunctive part of the sentence, the speakers mind goes to the present and to be dragged to the past, \"would have\" rather than \"would\" has to be used. I do not understand why.\n\nI feel stuck. Please address me any source, article, whatever you think might help me in this predicament. I've been mulling over it for the whole of the last week and couldn't come up with a plausible solution myself.",
