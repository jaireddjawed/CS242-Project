        "text": "For longer than I'd be willing to admit, I've been working on a project to index all NSFW subreddits, since I couldn't find anyone else who had done it in an easily accessible manner. The goal was to find something new, and original -- you ocasionally run into awesome isolated subreddits, so wouldn't it be nice to have a list?\n\nTherefore I created **redditcacher**:\n\n# https://redditcacher.herokuapp.com\n\nThe website is a preview of the entire app, which you can get and run yourself from [here](https://github.com/farid-fari/redditcacher). Most subreddits are sorted according to arbitrary criteria (inb4 *'y u sort that there?'* comments), but I'm willing to answer questions and resort if needed. There's also an arbitrary selection of SFW subreddits alongside, but they're marked as such.\n\nThe second interesting point here, and why I posted here, isn't so much the actual porn but rather the data: there's a [stats](https://redditcacher.herokuapp.com/stats) page which gives truly interesting insight into the most popular categories. You can also get the database for yourself, either in [postgreSQL](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/redditcacher/db_subbed.dump) or [sqlite](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/redditcacher/db_subbed.sqlite3) formats, if you want to go more in-depth with the analysis.\n\n### Cool things I ran into\n\nI have a fascination for niche things, and boy I've been served. The best ones are the ones that are small enough to not be overflown by 'common' posts (meaning it stays niche) but big enough to have some content. I'm not really going to list all that I've discovered, but I think the list really has the potential to make people discover new things next to /r/gonewild and /r/nsfw.\n\nOn a less cool note, I've noticed the demand for suggestive pictures of celebrities is immense. Even B-list celebs have their own subreddit with a good following and grabs from their snapchat or instagram with kind-of revealing pics. Not really my thing, and I think it even has a creepy vibe to it when you think of all the women willing to show their bodies.\n\nI also made a data visualization over on /r/dataisbeautiful -- check my comment below.\n\n### Uncool things I ran into\n\nThere's a lot of qurantined subs about depraved stuff, which I guess is pretty well known about. There was a sad moment when I came upon a dead pornstar's subreddit. I can't find it anymore, but there was a guy saying he had \"missed her birthday\" and was going to \"jerk off to you\" for it. :'(\n\n--\n\nI'm pretty sure the list is incomplete, but what I'd like to know is what you guys think of it all: why so many pornstar and celebrity subreddits? Why are users the least popular when amateurs are the most? Is my take on categories wrong?\n\nAlso, I'm open to any and all questions, as well as resorting suggestions (though I don't think it'll change the stats a lot).",

I would also like to collect some of this data and analyze it in order to eventually add an automated \"astroturfing prediction score\".\n\nThese are the metrics I've thought of so far that could be useful:\n\n* Account age\n* Post and comment frequency (incl. number of overall posts/comments and average posts/comments for a given time period)\n* Most commonly used words (incl. number of uses and frequency of occurance for the 5 most common words, excepting \"a\", \"I\", \"the\", etc)\n* Most commonly interacted-with subreddits\n* Most commonly linked-to websites\n\nAny thought, ideas, or concerns are welcome.

It’s from /r/arts, a community that I have, admittedly, never heard of. It seems like an odd idea to post a car insurance question in a subreddit about the arts, which made me look into it, but it only got stranger from there. \n\nWhen I opened the post there were 29 comments. All 29 were top level comments, no replies, and all with exactly one upvote. Also, 28 of the 29 comments follow the same format: One sentence that ends in a question mark followed by a series of sentences that explain the new question that the commenter proposed. None of the comments addressed the OP’s question about car insurance, but they did seem to all address insurance in some way. \n\nThis post is the all-time top rated post on /r/arts with 20 upvotes. The next highest post on there has 2. It seems like all the others posts on there are about embroidery and painting, the sorts of topics you would expect in a community called /r/arts. It doesn’t look like any other post in the community has ever had more than one comment, if any. \n\nOP of the post in question, /u/lezliesarkar, has been on Reddit for two years and only made two posts (no comments), the one above and [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthcarePricing/comments/6ekwt3/can_you_get_your_drivers_license_without_any/) from 4 months ago, also about car insurance, but this time in /r/HealthcarePricing, a slightly more reasonable place to ask about insurance, however still misguided. No comments on that one, though it does say there was one comment. I’m assuming that means it was deleted. No time for other mysteries right now. \n\nWhat is up with this post?

Possibly related to the announcement posted today to r/modnews?\n\n&gt;Hello All--\nWe want to let you know that we have made some updates to our site-wide rules regarding violent content. We did this to alleviate user and moderator confusion about allowable content on the site. We also are making this update so that Reddit’s content policy better reflects our values as a company.\nIn particular, we found that the policy regarding “inciting” violence was too vague, and so we have made an effort to adjust it to be more clear and comprehensive. Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. This applies to ALL content on Reddit, including memes, CSS/community styling, flair, subreddit names, and usernames.\nWe understand that enforcing this policy may often require subjective judgment, so all of the usual caveats apply with regard to content that is newsworthy, artistic, educational, satirical, etc, as mentioned in the policy. Context is key. The policy is posted in the help center here.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/78fqox/runcensorednews_uncensored_news_uncensorednews/",
        "text": "##Hello and Welcome to **A Report** regarding /r/uncensorednews, here I'll show and tell you the History and Controversy regarding the subreddit and it's sister subs (Subreddits that are closely related one way or another): \n\n/r/uncensorednews is one of the most Controversial Subreddits throughout the history of Reddit as a site, often being cited as one of the worst places on Reddit according to outside Articles ([1](https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/8xxymb/here-are-reddits-whiniest-most-low-key-toxic-subreddits) [2](https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2016/06/16/uncensorship/) [3](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/)). Whether or not you disagree with these articles and webpages doesn't matter since the subreddit is still referenced in each, which means that it's large enough (At 123,000 Subscribers) to gander Media attention. Disagree with the Authors of these Articles, not me, I couldn't care. \n\n---\n###History\n ---\nUncensorednews formed in 30 August 2013 (30/8/2013) but was inactive until 12 June 2016 (12/6/2016), consisting of Four Moderators; /u/RamblinRambo3, /u/CantStopWhitey (No longer a mod, but still active and unbanned), /u/AsshatVik (No longer a Moderator, and instead now mods /r/uncensorednewssucks) and /u/Ravelair (No longer a mod). The creator being /u/censorship_free (An account with no submissions and was only made to create uncensorednews). Very little is actually available earlier than 2016 due to inactivity. /r/uncensorednews became popular during 2016, becoming active due to [drama from /r/news.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4nqnrm/breaking_news_orlando_nightclub_massshooting/)\n\nDuring 2016, there was a lot of terrorist attacks. As such people from all over the internet searched for information regarding these attacks, most usually ending up on Reddit if they wanted to discuss it. Apparently due to a user-error, the /r/news team deleted a thread regarding the Orlando terrorist, but their excuse lacks credibility. /r/askreddit had to pick up the thread instead and it became one of their Top of All Time threads. A lot of users became enraged with the censorship from /r/news ([1](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4nqj95/rnews_mods_lock_and_delete_comments_on_any_thread/) [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4nr3nm/temporary_moratorium_on_drama_related_to_the/)) \n\nThis was when /r/uncensorednews became active again and took advantage of the outrage. Back then it looked [very plain and Grey](https://i.imgur.com/3Vh9NA6.png?1) (Worth noting that the timestamps are older than 2016) \n\nA day later, on the 13th they hit the frontpage of Reddit multiple times and became massive. Gaining new moderators, a sidebar, publicmodlog (More on that later), and flooded with brand new posts outraged with /r/news. [Now looking like this](https://i.imgur.com/XaclzgY.png?1) it quickly became popular and grew while /r/news lost their subscribers. [Metric Stats](http://redditmetrics.com/r/uncensorednews).\n\nThe stickied post in the archive above \"About the Modteam and a honest response to where we stand.\" is now deleted. Here it is, notable parts being their promises: \n\n*We will not ever entertain the idea of a safe space.\nIf a comment or submission does not break the rules it will not be removed no matter what.\nAll moderator removal actions will be followed by a comment by the “acting” moderator as to why a removal was made.\nWe will not pander to anyones feelings for any reason ever.*\n\nThe thread was removed due to them failing to keep these promises, scroll down to **Hypocrisy, Bias and Abuse** for more on those promises. \n\n[Now this is what their subreddit looks like \\(24/10/2017\\)](https://i.imgur.com/gUNgCcK.png). Note the Symbols, more of those later as well. Their more recent history, after 2016, will be featured in the following parts. \n\n---\n###Moderators, their History and Controversy\n---\n\nAs listed above, /r/uncensorednews has had a lot of Moderators come by and go. Typically creating drama when they leave. But there's a few which have been steadily active throughout the entire history of the subreddit. \n\nModerators are pretty much what make up a community, they control how it flows, how it works, everything. Reddit has very little protection for users dealing with power-hungry Moderators, but that's a piece for another time maybe. \n\n[Here is the current moderator team](http://archive.is/rl0Mv). We'll be discussing only a few of their mods, as well as publicmodlog... \n\n/u/RamblingRambo3 -- One of the more controversial Reddit users, even being featured in an article (Already listed above). Rambo has been around for a while, and is unfortunately a self-proclaimed nazi. Them and a few of their friends are the reason for the widespread nazism on /r/uncensorednews. I'll be showing you some examples of their nazism in the **Hatred, Racism and Nazism** parts. Alternatively, you may look for yourself. As for any active user in the meta-of-reddit, you'll probably already know about Rambo. /u/duckvimes_ did a piece on RamblingRambo **[here](https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/4nttzb/lets_talk_about_runcensorednews/)**, give it a read if you wish to learn more about him.\n\n/u/The_g0yim_know -- If the name didn't give it away, The_ is also a Nazi. The Goyin Know is a popular nazi catchphrase used for humour and as a dog whistle letting fellow Nazis know when the 'Jewish Elite' have caught on to their content, although they will usually tell you it's a joke. The_ actively posts \"The Siege Culture\", which is is a wordpress/entertainment channel for Nazis by Nazis. \n\n/u/Accipiter_hawk -- One of their newer Moderators, also happens to be a nazi. In a few of their comments they used [Triple Parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_parentheses), which is used by Nazis to point out those who are Jewish... Are you seeing a trend? \n\nI'm not going to go through literally every moderator they've had and have. That'd be a waste of characters, but I'm sure you can guess what the rest have in common with those listed above... \n\n/u/publicmodlog -- Public Modlog is a bot, it's exactly what it says, a Public Modlog. Which I feel as if every subreddit should have it, it'd make corruption easier to spot. Or in /r/uncensorednews, let us see the censorship inside of the sub. We'll be referring a lot to the bot and it's resources throughout the rest of this thread. I'll be linking images though, but you can view the modlogs for all subreddits with publicmodlog [here](https://snew.github.io/r/). Just put the subreddit name. To view what subs use publicmodlog, visit modlog's profile. \n**Unfortunately the abilities for modlog are somewhat limited, for example; you cannot view Mod Mail between Mods nor can you view Removed/Deleted content.** When I asked the Moderators to allow me to read the modmail, I got muted swiftly. It's not much of a big deal since it is a security risk bringing a stranger into the moderator team (Even with limited permissions). \n\nIt's also worth nothing that /r/uncensorednewsplus does not have Publicmodlog, but instead has all of the moderators. So most likely any corruption that they discuss happens in there. Obviously something private in there, or they forgot. Up to you to decide. \n\n---\n###Content, both Top and Hot\n---\n\nBefore I continue with **Hypocrisy, Bias and Abuse**, let's go through the content that's featured on /r/uncensorednews. I'm sure you already know what sort of content there is, so feel free to skip this part if you want. \n\nHere are /r/uncensorednews Top posts of all time: \n\n1: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/4nqw5e/50_dead_including_gunman_in_worst_us_mass/ -- A post spawned from the drama from /r/news, which we have already gone over. \n\n2: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5el4ve/uspez_ceo_of_reddit_claiming_he_changed_the/ -- A post regarding the drama caused by /u/spez (CEO) [editing comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5frl7p/spez_makes_an_announcement_on_the_editing_of/). \n\n3: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5btdrx/leaked_documents_reveal_billionaire_george_soros/ -- A post from PJMedia, [news that is typically false](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/), unfortunately the source they linked in the website doesn't lead anywhere. So I can't confirm if it's true or not, that's up to you to decide concerning their reputation. \n\nAnd here are their recent Hot posts: \n\n1: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/78bix8/this_instructor_calls_on_black_women_first_and/ -- A real Story.\n\n2: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/78auug/uncle_sam_poster_outrages_liberals_dont_apologize/ -- A story from infowars, which is [literally fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites). \n\n3: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/789d75/germany_antifa_accidentally_assault_leftists/ -- The Daily Stormer is an [official neo-nazi front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Stormer), hence the name. \n\nUncensorednews doesn't really feature a lot of real backed up and sourced news. Since the audience for these news sites (With the exception of the Daily Stormer) are quite broad, you'll most likely find some arguments down below in this original thread (First started and posted on /r/subredditcancer). So right now, it's moreso just uncensored instead of the news part now that we've went over that. How about we also remove the uncensored part...? \n\n---\n###Hypocrisy, Bias and Abuse\n---\nSo without news, at least we still have the uncensored part... Right? \n\n\nBias, Hypocrisy and Abuse: https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5qwr6g/user_criticizes_breitbart_on_runcensorednews_is/ -- The Moderators showed bias towards certain news and abused their power, becoming hypocrites. \n\nHypocrisy: https://np.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/6esxxa/the_hypocrisy_displayed_by_runcensorednews_theyre/\n\nBias, Hypocrisy and Abuse: https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5i78zo/think_its_fake_news_prove_it_or_youre_banned/ -- The Moderators show Bias towards certain news and abuse their power, becoming hypocrites. Again. \n\nLet's look at [all recently removed comments ](https://snew.github.io/r/uncensorednews/about/log?type=removecomment)(Due to Modlog's limited abilities, we cannot see what the comments featured. But you can probably guess what they said). Here's an [imgur in case they decide to remove the modlogs](https://i.imgur.com/Vg9XiAb.png?1). There's a lot more than that. \n\n[How about all recently banned users?](https://snew.github.io/r/uncensorednews/about/log?type=banuser) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/B8CgSV4.png?1) \n\n[Bias via approving comments.](https://snew.github.io/r/uncensorednews/about/log?type=approvecomment) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lqJvUbV.png?1)\n\nPointing out fake news and unreliable sources: \n\n1: https://imgur.com/a/oNQz9\n\n2: https://imgur.com/a/FnIyQ\n\nA post from a former /r/uncensorednews mod regarding the censorship: https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/4tm6p2/modcancer_in_an_unexpected_spot_uuncensorednews/\n\nRecent Users banned: \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/77zx9h/pittsburgh_is_648_percent_white_and_26_percent/doq6ej4/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/77p32k/london_now_more_dangerous_than_new_york_city/dormdmd/ (Statistics are statistics, racists cherry picking statistics to paint a specifically racist picture is racist.\nEdit: First off, I was just banned from this uncensored sub for 'disruption'. Your living a lie, boys.)\n\nSo there we have it. The Moderators tend to ban and remove any content that they dislike. So without the news part and uncensored part... What do we have? \n\n---\n###Hatred, Racism, Nazism and much more\n---\nAs often mentioned in the articles at the very start of this **Report**, /r/uncensorednews is an incredibly toxic place, featuring widespread Racism, Nazism, White Supremacy and just general Hatred towards everything and everyone (Except themselves). Let's begin this massive train. Props if you can read through every single one, probably wise to visit /r/eyebleach afterwards though.\n\nRacism from mods:

subreddit. It's usually approved and reports are ticked as ignored for content such as this, link above in the Publicmodlog. [Here's a good source to view even more](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/search?q=flair%3Auncensorednews&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) of this content coming from /r/uncensorednews. \n\n---\n###More Nazism\n---\nLet's go back to the image shown waaay in the **History** Section, you may need to scroll back up if you forgot about it. But I briefly mentioned the [Symbols in their Subreddit Style.](https://i.imgur.com/gUNgCcK.png) These are Nazi Symbols, if you couldn't already guess. \n\nThe Pyramid one is called [the Valknut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valknut). It's a rare symbol used by White Supremacists and Christian Extremists. \n\nThe Round one is called [the Black Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_\\(occult_symbol\\)). Used by the Nazis during WW2, mostly for Higher-Ups. \n\n---\n###Sister/Related Subs\n---\nUncensorednews, much like most of the subreddits from the \"[Moonman_Industries](https://np.reddit.com/r/Moonman_Industries/)\", there's a lot of different copies of Uncensorednews under different names. Aside from the name, they're basically identical in every single way, same mods, same everything. \n\nWe've already briefly covered one: \n\n/r/uncensorednewsplus -- From what I can gather, this is where the Private Inner-workings of /r/uncensorednews operates. Probably to hide away from publicmodlog and discuss their next plans. They've been around and doing this for a while. \n\n/r/Moon_Industries -- Seems to be a Joke Subreddit, but it features the same/similar moderators. It also features some Neo-Nazi content, nice. \n\n/r/redditcensors -- Redditcensors immediately after the [banning of /r/altright](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5ri97o/raltright_has_been_banned_discuss_this_here/), a very blatant Nazi-Subreddit that got booted off for doxxing different users. They had Nazi-Flags and swastikas as flairs. \n\n/r/europeannationalism -- Another Nazi Subreddit created by Rambo. It features the symbols above. It was extremely inactive until the [banning of /r/european](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4j2bts/reuropean_has_been_quarantined/), a Nazi-Alternative to /r/europe. It features the Symbols above. \n\n/r/thelyingpress -- Another Nazi Subreddit created by Rambo. It features more Nazi Symbols. The only remaining [poster is an automated bot](https://np.reddit.com/user/gabout/overview/), most likely from Stormfront.  \n\n/r/uncensoredopinions -- Basically made as a subreddit for the modteam to deal with the above comments. They gave up shortly afterwards, and it's only occasionally used. \n\n/r/traditionalwives/ -- A White Supremacy subreddit that also features sexism. It's populated entirely by men. No women. Odd that...\n\n/r/regroup_central -- A part of the network. No idea what it's used for, completely empty, only Rambo's in it. The Tab-Description is a bit ominous though. \n\n/r/AutismGoneWild -- A subreddit which Rambo and his friends acquired. Currently dead, and will most likely be revived when uncensorednews gets the ban. \n\n/r/NordicResistance -- Created again by Rambo, he's Finnish. However there's not many Finnish people on Reddit who are also Nazis like he is, so it's dead. \n\n/r/sjwhate -- Another Neo-Nazi subreddit, it once had Nazi Symbols, but that's since then been removed (Unfortunately no archives exist). Now it's a SJW-Hate circlejerk subreddit. They're no longer a part of the Network, but have been. Whether or not they still are is unknown, that's up to you to guess. \n\n/r/The_Real_Bonhomme -- Unknown purpose.\n\n/r/far_right -- Another Nazi Subreddit, featuring more Nazi Flags. \n\n/r/actualjournalism -- Unknown if it is a Nazi Sub. Certainly features deliberately misleading content, and the only active poster is a bot that got banned. \n\nI probably missed a lot, they have a tendancy to make as many as they can in hopes that they get lucky (Like with uncensorednews). If you know any, simply message me or comment. Just be sure to mention my username before you do, so I can see it. Moving on...  \n\nFor this section I'll be using 538's Subreddit Algebraic Algorithim (Basically finds things related to one another by searching for keywords, phrases and users. [Here's an article about it.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/)), it's an incredibly useful tool to determine if subreddits are suited to your tastes or contain some nasty content that you wish to avoid. Sometimes subreddits have odd names that seem completely unrelated to their content, and you don't want to be fooled by that, or maybe you do, I don't know. Let's see what Subreddits are similar to /r/uncensorednews!\n\n1) /r/HillaryForPrison -- A sister subreddit created by the same people who brought you /r/The_Donald, or at least worked with TD. The sub's pretty simple, post stuff about Hillary Clinton. Even though she lost ages ago and no longer holds any political power... But whatever helps them cope, I guess. \n\n2) /r/undelete -- This used to be one of my favourite subreddits, it shows what posts get deleted/removed from the frontpage. It's super useful to view what multiple different Moderators are up to. However it's been filled with members from TD, so now it's extremely biased, which isn't very good for what's meant to be an unbiased place for Meta-Reddit discussion. \n\n3) /r/conspiracy -- Lots of different opinions are around conspiracy. Some love it, like /r/topmindsofreddit, others hate it. It's lately been compromised and has been taken over (Another piece for another time, maybe), view the Mod List to see. Note the times. \n\n4) /r/The_Donald -- Without a doubt the largest controversial subreddit throughout the site's history. I've done a few pieces of these guys and just how nasty they can be. You'll find that TD infects itself into literally every subreddit that's dedicated to hate or has hateful content such as the comments featured way above in the train. My other pieces are linked at the very end of this post if you wish to view them. It's a bit concerning though that Trump's largest community has a 66 overlapping similarity score with Nazis... \n\n5) /r/WikiLeaks -- It's a subreddit for Wikileaks. \n\n6) /r/sjwhate -- Already featured above. The overlap leads me to believe that it's still a part of their network (Which is why I put it above)\n\n7) /r/nottheonion -- A default subreddit, and one of my personal favourites. It's everyone's favourite! So I can't fault the members of /r/uncensorednews from visiting it. \n\n8) /r/AskTrumpSupporters -- Ask Trump Supporters is more so 'Ask Trump Supporters questions that are decidedly suitable', that is to say that the Moderators there hold all questions that are criticising of Trump. Sort of defeats the purpose, but whatever. \n\n9) /r/DNCLeaks -- As featured above, the members of /r/uncensorednews loves Soros, he's like some sort of attractive flower for them if they were bees. It's a sister-sub of wikileaks. \n\n10) /r/worldpolitics -- A default subreddit. One that's constantly filled with anger, frustration and arguing. They're often featured here on /r/subredditcancer, even though the Moderators themselves are actually pretty alright. All 90 of them. \n\n---\n###Closing Goodbye and Admin Inaction against Hate Subs\n---\nWell that's all she wrote, or all I wrote in this case. I probably missed a ton of stuff regarding this Nazi-Network, but I think I got all of the important stuff out of the way. If you notice anything missing, simply pm me, comment in this thread or make your own. Go wild. \n\nAs for Admins Inaction, yes the Admins, no one likes the Admins. Not even the Admins like the Admins. But there's no real answer for their inaction against hatesubs such as these. They occasionally step in and fix things up and remove harmful communities. But let's try to be fair to them, they're a tiny team of a few hundred, and need to manage Millions of Users and Subreddits, manage the servers that are constantly straining, update the site and much more. That's a lot of work, and I don't really envy them. From what I've seen from Admin Responses, they prefer to just code and add more things to the site, and avoid site-wide drama. \n\nAnd now you've reached the end. Thanks for reading it all, if you did, I don't think you did. I hope you did, this was a pain to type, all 31268 characters. Well, it's more than that now. **BYE.** \n\n---\nPrevious works ([1](https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/6ape77/documentation_regarding_rthe_donald_using_bots_to/) [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/72c8yl/rthe_donald_rtd_td_t_d_is_quite_literally_a_cult/))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I have a couple of old GW profiles in mind that I would like to share ('cause nudes are a timeless classic, right?), but I would also like to not have my profile banned in case it's against the rules.\n\nFrom the [content rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-involuntary-pornography-and) (my emphasis):    \n\n\"Reddit prohibits the **posting of photographs**, videos, or digital images **of any person in a state of nudity** or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, taken or **posted without their permission.**\"\n\nNow this is where interpretations come into play: Have they given permission?\n\nNow, of course I have not received neither spoken nor written word from these girls whether I am allowed to post their nudes or not, and already there it could be argued that I should not post. Even if leaving GW posts up on both Reddit and Imgur can be seen as some form of implied permission, an implication should not be considered permission, as we have seen often in the whole media coverage of involuntary pornography.\n\nHowever, there are obviously some counter-arguments to make. First of all: What about all the porn that's posted here? There's no given permission that that should be posted either and I also recall that during The Fappening, Reddit defended itself saying that it was merely a content aggregation site in that it did not host any of the content other than thumbnails. The GW albums are still available on Imgur, but what I want to do is make an album of all their photos to collect in one post, therefore making it impossible to post all of the photos without making a new album, thus making me unable to link to a(n) album(s) under their administration (so that they could take down the album themselves if they did not want it on Reddit anymore)\n\nWhat is your take on this? I have not posted anything yet, don't worry. Also, keep in mind that I am more than willing to take the posts down at first notice and admins and moderators of Reddit are welcome to remove them if they see them unfit for the subreddits in which they would be posted.",

I’m using a throwaway account because I don’t want my main Reddit account to be harassed for sharing this secret. \n\nSo earlier this week I started to participate in a subreddit where I never really participated in. I did a lot of voting in that subreddit but almost never commented. I then downvoted a troll comment and accidentally logged out. This was when I discovered that my vote did not count. I tried it with another comment on the same subreddit. Guess what? The votes did not count once again. \n\nAt first I started to think I was shadowbanned but then I realized I was not as I went to test to see if upvotes counted yet it did indeed count. I went to a subreddit in which I normally would participated in on a day to day basis. So I came up with the theory that maybe users with little to no participation will not have their vote registered. I tested this theory by going on a subreddit that I participate on a daily basis and look what happened. The vote actually went in! I even did this to 10 different comments on 10 different threads to make sure yet same result.\n\nI then tested this on another random subreddit with none of those downvotes counting. With that being said, I have discovered that a lack of subreddit participation can result in votes not registering. I do not know how much “participation” is needed but all I know now is if there isn’t enough participation, it will not count.\n\nDon’t believe me? Try it yourself. Go to a random subreddit and downvote a random comment then wait 5 minutes and log out. It will not count towards the points. \n",

        "text": "Here is the specific use case motivating this question:\n\nLast week I was in an hour-long line at U.S. Customs when an airport employee casually announced that \"users of the Mobile Passport app\" could skip the line.  I pulled out my iPhone, installed the app, answered some questions and got to the final \"receipt\" screen, then waved the employee down and asked, \"Like this?\"  He said \"Yep\" and pulled me out of the line and took me to the front.\n\nSo, wishing to share this bit of wisdom, I got home and submitted a post on r/LifeProTips about the Mobile Passport app, flaired under \"travel\", telling everyone you can do this to skip the huge line at Customs.  The mods removed it saying (accurately) that it violated the rule \"No products or services for their intended use.\"\n\nThis is frustrating because spreading this information would have been a pure benefit to a lot of people, an economist's proverbial \"free lunch\", but the sub rules didn't allow it.  Generally, I would argue the most valuable \"life pro tip\" posts are the ones where (1) there is an obvious benefit and (2) the tip is not widely known already.  Now, the \"no intended use\" rule is probably to increase the chance of a post meeting criterion #2 -- most people are aware of the *intended* use of a product.  But in those cases where the intended use of a product is not already widely known, a tip about intended usage can be valuable.\n\nSo, imagine a perfect meritocracy where two subreddits exist side-by-side; both are for \"life pro tips\", but the first does not allow \"products or services for their intended use\", but the second one does allow those as long as the tip is something that is not widely known already and could benefit the readers.  In a perfect meritocracy, users would leave the first subreddit for the second one if they found value in those kinds of posts, unless the first subreddit modified their rules to allow those posts too.\n\nOf course that does not happen in real life, because the \"bandwagon effect\" means that people tend to go to whatever subreddits are already the most popular, so those subs don't get subject to normal market competition forces.  This is frustrating because it means they are not as good as they otherwise would be in a competitive market.\n\nBut what if there were a way to change that, so that subreddits were subject to more \"meritocratic\" competitive forces, which would lead them to make changes that would benefit the readers more?\n\nIn a post a few weeks ago, I mentioned something I'd posted in IdeasForTheAdmins about how to fix the \"bandwagon effect\" for posts *within* a subreddit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/6ye24r/have_post_visibility_determined_by_the_votes_of_a/\nBasically, have new posts displayed to a random sample of subscribers to that subreddit, and have those subscribers rate the post without seeing each other's ratings or seeing the author's name.  The average of those ratings would determine the post's visibility.  This avoids the \"bandwagon\" effect and makes the visibility much more meritocratic.\n\nSo here's the interesting question: Could a version of this algorithm work for the subreddits themselves?  Basically, if a poll of a random sample of a subreddit's subscribers indicates that they would strongly prefer proposed rule B over existing rule A, that a change from rule A to rule B just \"magically happens\"?\n\nI was brainstorming some ways this could be implemented:\n\n(1) You can have an automated process by which anybody can propose a rule change, and the rule change goes to a random sample of subreddit subscribers.  If a majority vote in favor, then (possibly after an intermediate step where everyone votes on it), the rule gets updated automatically.  (To discourage frivolous proposals, you can have a karma penalty if someone proposes a rule change that's so stupid it gets resoundingly rejected.) Now, if we're keeping the philosophy that mods get the final say on the rules of their subreddit, we don't want to force this automated process on subreddits that don't want it.  But it could be a flag that mods could turn on for their subreddit, where the flag advertises, \"This subreddit is subject to automated democratic rule changes.\"\n\n(2) Let people create a spinoff subreddit with the new rules, and let people choose between them.\n\nHey, you're saying, the site lets you do that already. The twist would be that the new subreddit mods could ask the system to poll a random sample of the existing subreddit's users and say, \"There's a new subreddit, almost like this one, but with X, Y and Z rule changes.  Would you prefer that?\"  If a majority of the random sample votes yes, then the link to the new subreddit gets displayed somewhere on the landing page for the existing one, with something to indicate, \"If you like this subreddit, you might also be interested in this one.\"\n\nOne problem with this is that it's still not very meritocratic, because even if users prefer the new subreddit's rules, it still starts out with far fewer subscribers, so users will tend to prefer to post in the old one.\n\n(3) Rather than removing a post for violating a given rule, give it some flair-like attribute that lets subreddit subscribers filter it out by default -- but, at the same time, give the subscribers the option not to filter out those kinds of posts.  If it becomes particularly popular for subscribers to *not* filter out certain types of posts, then the mods may be more likely to consider allowing them.  (Or if the mods still choose not to change the rules, then at least those subscribers can continue not to filter out those posts, creating a sort of \"pseudo-spinoff\" subreddit within the subreddit, with slightly different rules.)\n\nIt's frustrating any time you see a situation where most people would prefer A to B, but we're stuck with B because B is not subject to normal market competition.  But I think that in algorithm-driven environments like Reddit, there are often ways to change that.",

Microsoft just placed their bet with their Mixed Reality platform on Windows 10 and their recent aquisition of AltSpaceVR. Their Mixed Reality platform is already being diligently worked on by developers and slated to be unleashed to the mainstream this holiday season. \n\n Some may say its too early for Mixed Reality since HMDs lack resolution, cost efficiency, and computing efficiency, but that doesnt stop developers from experimenting with this new and emerging platform. Especially with corporations willing to throw money into innovative forms of experiencing their brand.\n\n But my question is, what are your thoughts on Reddit and its relationship with mixed reality? Do you think they should welcome spatial experiences early on, or wait a few years for the spatial platform to mature? Do you think they'll expand the \"Reddit Experience\" with multiplayer/social features? What are your thoughts?",

        "text": "I submitted a post today that has gotten &gt;16,500 upvotes at the time of writing. However, so far I have received roughly 6,000 post karma from it. That's less than half of the upvote total. While I haven't taken the time to directly compare this with other, lower score posts I have submitted, I am fairly positive that said lower score posts netted karma much closer to the upvote total.\n\nSo the question is, why does reddit deliver diminishing karma returns on high-upvote posts? I think there may be a few reasons for this.\n\nFor one, reddit has been playing around with the vote-balancing algorithms a lot in the last year due to trends in the way vote brigading has been happening on the site. Specifically around the US political sphere, there have been a concentrated efforts to control the front page by certain factions of users. I believe that as a response to this, reddit may be attempting to obscure true karma values as a way to hamper anyone trying to reverse engineer their voting algorithms.\n\nAnother reason may be to help control for monetized accounts. A lot of zombie accounts with high karma totals have been going up for sale on the web to the highest bidders, primarily spammers. Establishing a diminishing return on high upvote posts may be a security measure to make sure that accounts don't recieve an inordinate amount of karma from just one or two posts, which makes it more time consuming and thus less profitable to build up accounts to sell.",

        "text": "Something that I have noticed recently(specifically in some of the sports subreddits, but it happens everywhere) is that moderators are using megathreads to silence discussion around subjects they find unsavory. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's face it, megathreads are not ideal for promoting good discussions. There's way too many posts, the posts are sorted by new, and it is very hard to have any kind of discussion.\n\nBy creating megathreads around certain topics, it allows mods to remove discussion around a subject in the rest of the entire subreddit, and strictly enforce this silencing by pointing users to the clunky megathreads. I find this especially offensive because it allows people who want to stop discussion around a topic to not only stop those discussions, but to claim they are actually promoting discussions on the subject.\n\nI don't think megathreads should be used in place of actual moderation and they strike me as a very lazy way to remove discussion from 99.9% of the subreddit while leaving one place to talk about it so that they can claim that they are not silencing discussion. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI would much prefer for subreddits to periodically allow posts on a subject through, and allow those discussions to happen in the other threads organically as well, as opposed to shoving all discussion into a megathreads and removing any discussion around a topic from the rest of the subreddit.\n\nI think the best proof that megathreads are being used to silence discussions is that when subreddits have overwhelmingly popular discussions they want to promote, a thread is always chosen to survive(usually the first post, or in case of a tie the post with the most upvotes) and discussions around the topic are allowed and encouraged throughout the subreddit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think the format of megathreads has to change or subreddits need to stop using them to silence discussions or Reddit stops being Reddit and starts to become like Digg(the new curated Digg). Part of the appeal of Reddit(perhaps its biggest draw) is that the users have a real voice in mapping the plot of a subreddit but megathreads are being used by mods to take that voice away.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

This checklist was written mostly by [Michael Langone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Langone), a Psychologist who specialised with counseling cultist movements and cult-members in order to make them return to society. Found it interesting, and noticed that TD ticks every single box for a cult-movement. \n\nThere are 15 different Boxes to determine whether a movement is cult-like or not.

Criticising Trump is a permabannable offence (They prefer to keep that content at /r/AskTrumpSupporters or /r/AskThe_Donald). If you disagree, then post some comments in TD showing doubt and link them here. You'll get banned since it's against their rules. \n\n---\n\n&gt; * Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.\n\n---\n\nThis blends in with the top comment. \n\n---\n\n&gt; * Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, and debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).\n\n---\n\nTD only fit two examples of the practices. One of which are chanting (This goes for all Trump Supporters, MAGA, Lock Her Up, etc~), and the other is denunciation sessions.

So I'll be using one of their serious Sister-Subs as a more detailed example which you can browse through yourself; /r/TheRightBoycott (Which is moderated and created by TD regulars and is meant to be taken seriously.)\n\n---\n\n&gt; * The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example, members must get permission to date, change jobs, marry, or leaders prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, whether or not to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).\n\n---\n\nThis mostly goes towards the Trump Administration itself, which I won't do because it's been done to death.

Everyone should be able to get the picture here... \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5frrsz/ceo_of_reddit_just_called_us_toxic_users_and_a/\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5c9bt2/thats_fucking_it_i_nominate_soros_as_1_enemny_of/\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6h7tib/democrats_media_the_blood_is_on_your_hands/\n\n---\n\n&gt; * The leader is not accountable to any authorities (unlike, for example, teachers, military commanders or ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream religious denominations).\n\n---\n\nHe is the authority.\n\n---\n\n&gt; * The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members' participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group (for example, lying to family or friends, or collecting money for bogus charities).\n\n---\n\nIt's unethical to deport an entire religion and group of being from the actions of extremists inside of an active warzone: \nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3A%23NEVERISLAM\n\nChanging behaviour and being more vocal afterwards: https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a1xhc/the_positive_effects_of_supporting_trump_ive/\n\n(Note: I don't care about religion.)\n\n---\n\n&gt; *  The leadership induces feelings of shame and/or guilt iin order to influence and/or control members. Often, this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.\n\n---\n\nThis one is more about the Trump Administration. Which I won't be going into as I've stated before. \n\nAs for guilt, due to no criticism or doubts due to the first Box, there's very little posts about this: https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6tzn1g/voted_for_hillary_lifelong_democrat_but_today_i/\n\n---\n\n&gt; * Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group.\n\n---\n\nDrama with Family/Disowning them:\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/508ozy/when_you_just_want_to_maga_at_the_atl_rally_but/\n\nAgain, due to the tight rules regarding positivity, there's very little posts. \n\n---\n\n&gt; * The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.\n\n---\n\nTD mostly recruits new members after terrible terrorist attacks or geopolitical instability and misinformation. Since things are somewhat calm, there's no recruitment processes going on for TD itself. But there are a few other pieces of media that TD is conducting recruits:\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/72ab3v/fuck_the_nfl_and_fuck_you/\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/70rycg/there_appears_to_be_no_organized_group_for/\n\n(Both are recent as of making of this post; 25/09/2017)\n\n---\n\n&gt; *  The group is preoccupied with making money.\n\n---\n\nCurrently it's not known if the moderators of TD are attempting any scams. However, they have conducted one in the past which resulted in them getting removed from Reddit:\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/535rhv/milo_yiannopoulos_and_moderators_on_the_donald/\n\n---\n\n&gt; * Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities.\n\n---\n\nTD loves to spread out throughout Reddit and the internet (This subreddit is actually one of theirs, which is subredditcancer, so that's why there's a high downvote percentage.):\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6iizo7/post_your_best_liberal_tears_here/\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/702qqc/we_are_being_brigaded_post_things_to_make_them_go/\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/64sv0t/i_just_made_a_the_donald_account_on_tumblr_where/\n\nDue to these posts being old, I can't accurately find the posts which were made from these above threads. When TD decides to have another Post-Content Thread, there's a large post increase during that time period. \n\n---\n\n&gt; * Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.\n\n---\n\nThe majority of TD believe that Reddit is a singular entity that's too big to poke. So instead they prefer to spend their time in their safespace, you can see this for yourself by clicking on the Post History of a few TD-Regulars and seeing what subs they post to. \nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6qw6vl/lets_have_a_vote_how_many_of_you_would_not_be/\n\n---\n\n&gt; * The most loyal members (the ï¿½true believersï¿½) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave (or even consider leaving) the group.\n\n---\n\nThis relates to the box above. \n\n---\n\nSo there you have it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. This thread was first started on /r/subredditcancer (Which most likely has a high downvote percentage)\n\nHere is my previous thread regarding The_Donald and their voting habits (Low Quality): https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/6ape77/documentation_regarding_rthe_donald_using_bots_to/",
