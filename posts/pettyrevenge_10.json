Whenever they came to our house mom would notice things moved &amp; missing from her medicine cabinet. Fed up she brought it up and the dinner table. Believing it was Jade but not wanting to accuse, she asked was anyone in need of a Tylenol or something similar because someone keeps going in the medicine cabinet. Everyone looked confused and Jade said maybe it‚Äôs your daughter (me). She said maybe then dropped. Next get together my mother drilled a hole in the top of the cabinet &amp; filled it with marbles. 10 minutes into dinner Jade excused herself to use the bathroom. The we all hear the crash of many many marbles crashing into the sink. Jade assumed no one heard and tried putting them back. Came out of the bathroom like nothing happened. My mother said before u leave, u owe me about $250 for all the makeup &amp; skincare products u lifted. She acted appalled. Her boyfriend said shut up we heard u &amp; we‚Äôre leaving now. Mom got her money &amp; Jade became single again. Miss my mother &amp; her brilliant but petty mind! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüòäüòäüòä",

        "text": "So this happened around my last month in college. So I enrolled in nursing school, and from where I enrolled, we were fixed with a group where we would always be together during clinical rotations, etc.\n\nShort background: For us to graduate and take the local board exam, we needed to comply with the requirements of our regulatory board -- this included handling and assisting during births and surgeries. When the pandemic happened, we couldn‚Äôt finish our requirements, and we were stuck with online school for three semesters. So on our last semester of the entire program, the school could finally conduct face-to-face classes that included our clinical rotations/related learning experience in the hospital.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm the leader of my group -- They appointed me the leader because of my experience as a student leader. So I was the one who made a rotation for my group on who‚Äôd be handling the following case (assisting during birth). \n\nThroughout our exposure in the delivery room, there were only 3/4 of us left who lacked the requirements; this included me and Gary (Obviously not his real name), so I, alongside Anna (Not her real name, and also lacks one more delivery) had to make a new rotation so that we (the ones lacking) were the only ones to take new cases.\n\nGary saw the new rotation (We were sitting afar, but he was in our vision) and was angry because why he was last on the rotation; So he threw the rotation and didn‚Äôt talk to me for the rest of the day instead of communicating with me privately and what any other practicing professional would do.\n\nGary always comes in late. Luckily, on the last two days of our rotation, there were deliveries, and I could handle them because I always arrive early. Deliveries are spontaneous, so there‚Äôs no assurance when the next delivery will be. He was pissed, and he‚Äôd always sulk.\n\nCue the petty revenge:\n\nGary always entrusts me with his things since we‚Äôve become group mates -- because he always loses his stuff -- his logbook, his requirements for graduation (I help out my members, and because of how organized I can be). So on the day he was pissed, I gave him back everything that was with me.\n\nIn our last few weeks, our admin announced to compile all of our requirements; he was panicking because he couldn‚Äôt find his requirements and was asking the rest of my groupmates if they had seen them. Since he couldn‚Äôt find them, he had to redo many of the papers because he lost them after I gave them back.\n\nMy batchmates know how selfless I can be and do everything I can to help. Since I was already done with mine, he asked for my help; I stared and said, ‚ÄúI already did,‚Äù and went to the following table with my friends and did nothing",

The stench of his unwashed body and unlaundered clothes stunk up the whole unit and hallway beyond it. You‚Äôd have thought something crawled into the ceiling and died. It is surprisingly difficult to put into words just how bad this man smelled. Imagine the scent of spoiled milk combined with a dead skunk. To make things worse, if I was away for the weekend he‚Äôd invite over his drug addicted friend who‚Äôd sleep in my bed and leave the covers undone.\n\nDespite all my attempts to communicate my displeasure I knew there was no salvaging this shitstorm of a living situation. At one point he threw a coupon book at my head while I was sleeping. He claimed I was snoring and he didn‚Äôt want to walk across the room to wake me up.\n\nI talked to the RA (this was a college dorm) and was able to move to a different dorm across the campus. Without telling my roommate, I moved out one evening while he was away at classes. I didn‚Äôt tell him I was moving out. That man returned to his dorm room to find it devoid of everything except his foul odor, his messy stuff, and two windows glued open in -15¬∞F weather. \n\nLater I found out from a former neighbor that he‚Äôd been confused by my disappearance and told everyone ‚Äúwe were such good roommates, I don‚Äôt know why he left.‚Äù \n\nLiar.",

        "text": "So we took the challenge, loaded and fired.  It was joyous to behold.\n\nSome few (many) years ago there was a software team within an air force primarily aimed at making operational changes to an aircraft's software originally provided by industry.  Industry kept ownership and didn't like that the team could make any changes at all so getting anything cleared to be used in flight was, to say the least, like popping a huge pimple you know is going to hurt but you still go ahead.  Of course, this led to a lot of frustration in the team as 3 years down the line the biggest change was amending a constant value.  Any way, the team had full QA, oversight by flight authority and the aircrew liked they could make suggestions to people just over the Pan (the concrete servicing plinth).\n\nThe team had been griping for ages about not actually getting any software done but they have full documentation of all proposals.  However, it did take many reviews to get the docs right but they thought it was perfect every time.  One particularly outspoken guy on how good his docentation always was got a fright one day.  Now, peer reviews were done by 3 people plus a QA guy.  In the review every person declared they read the doc under review to cover all aspects like functionality and the security processes.  A Team Lead and one subordinate disbelieved it all as there was always a lot of changes needed from the review but all seemed to be in the first 20 to 50% of the doc. \n\nCorporal KIA one day left his doc open over lunch and a nursery somehow magically entered on the last but one page.  \n\nAn officer with little software experience always led the review meetings.  He was known by a certain nickname (make your own choice here) as always wanting things written his way.\n\nThe formal review meeting starts and the officer states he found a typo in one of the content entry listings and wanted the listing formatted differently.  The subordinate leaves the room.  The meeting goes on for another hour and at the end the Team Lead goes to be the end of the doc and suggests everyone reads para 2.  There were gasps all around.  The subordinate enters the room and gives the officer a blank sheet of paper.  Everyone is wondering wtf?  The statement from the subordinate was, \"You write it and I'll type it up.\"\n\nTeam Lead and subordinate were shortly to leave the service but I'm told the story got embellished over the years.",

A couple days into the new job, I find out that another teammember had recently transferred out because his fiance,, who he had gotten a job there, who he had a Child with, was sleeping with K. Obviously this made a horrible first impression on me, but I needed the job so I just minded my own business and did my work.\n\nI noticed K was extremely charasmatic. He made people feel important and listened to, but the second they turned their back, he'd shit on them. This applied to pretty much everyone on the team except for like, one older dude.\n\nK comes into work frequently still on a coke bender, and vapes weed so he can come back down. Him and I had a pretty close relationship, and since I had formerly been a cop (I swear people here this and think it's time to pretend were in a confession booth) he tells me all the drugs he likes to do and how often he does them, etc. \n\nFast forward maybe a year. I fucked up a job for someone very important- I admit I screwed up and I mitigate the problems it caused. K is cool to me to my face- ' Don't worry about it G_Man, shit happens.'   \n\nI find out from two other coworkers, the dude went off about me to them. ' Fuck G_man, I cant believe that dumbass dropped the ball, that mother fucker' Etc, etc. So I confronted him immediately. I asked if he had anything he wanted to say, and that I felt like we were tight enough that if he needed to be frank, I could handle it. The prick literally says ' Bro, you couldnt possibly be doing a better job'. \n\n\nSo I emailed HR about his drug use, they sent someone to perform a drug test on him, and he was fired.\n\n\nI know people will call me a snitch/rat etc. I don't care, watching him being walked out was great. The look he gave me- he was so horrified I turned on him.",

Somebody kept using it all and never replaced it. She even started putting a piece of masking tape on the bottle that said ‚ÄúNAME‚ÄôS CREAMER. DO NOT USE!‚Äù, but of course that didn‚Äôt deter them. \n\n\nShe had recently delivered my sister and returned from maternity leave and was hormonal, exhausted, and stressed, so when she found her bottle of creamer in the fridge (empty), she kinda lost it a bit and went off in the break room about whoever the inconsiderate jerk was that kept taking her stuff. Everybody relentlessly made fun of her for it; one guy even went as far as calling her ‚Äòthe creamer c**t‚Äô behind her back. \n\n\nSo the following week, she left her usual bottle of creamer in the same spot in the fridge, but this time with a note taped to the fridge door. ‚ÄòY‚Äôall can call me whatever names you want, but you should definitely stop taking my creamer!‚Äô No later than 9:30 AM the same day, ‚Äòcreamer c**t‚Äô guy was dry heaving into the break room sink. \n\n\n‚ÄúOh my GOSH! Are you okay?? Are you sick??‚Äù, my mom asks. ‚ÄúI know you put spoiled creamer in there on purpose, you petty b***h!!!‚Äù\n\n\nMy mom casually walks over to the fridge, pulls out the bottle of creamer with the masking tape on it and shows it to him, saying ‚ÄúWell, if you had bothered to read the label, you‚Äôd know that it‚Äôs not creamer. The storage bottle for my breast pump broke, so I had to find another container. Lookit, it‚Äôs clearly marked ‚ÄòNAME‚ÄôS BREAST MILK, NOT FOR COFFEE‚Äô. See? It‚Äôs right there.‚Äù\n\n\nHe was a known asshole around the office and was already on thin ice with management, so he knew better than to say anything. He never took anyone‚Äôs stuff from the fridge after that, though!\n\n\nShe has another petty revenge story that‚Äôs pretty great, I‚Äôll post it in the comments. My mom pulled NO punches back in the day!",

Even his they look.    \nHe isn't allergic, he just hates them.    \n    \nSo i started to hide coconuts everywhere in sometimes obscure and wierd places, sometimes in obvious places.    \n    \nAnd let me tell you something, coconuts are cheap, and my gf at the time worked at a store and would always take home ALOT of outdated coconuts to help me with my revenge.    \n    \nI his them in his clothes, inside his computer, in the shower, under his bed, under his mattress, in the kitchen fan, in his bag and so on...    \nHe knew it was me, but he didn't know it was also my gf, which didn't live with us at the time.    \n    \nOfc i denied it every time.\nAnd he really became paranoid when coconuts would just \"appear\" out of nowhere.    \nWhen him and me were at the university, i had given my key to my gf, which promptly went home to us, and filled the entire fridge, the entire freezer, his ENTIRE wardrobe.    \n    \nFor all he knew, she was \"out of town\" and she gave my keys back to me at university when i took a WC break.    \n    \nHe completely flipped out when we got home, he couldn't believe it!  We only had two keys and went to the same classes, so he had been with me the entire time, except for the WC break.    \nHe asked to see my key, which i ofc har at that point.    \nHe REALLY became paranoid...    \n    \nHe called the landlord and asked how many keys we had, and he said we only had two...    \n    \nHe started from then always search for coconuts, and he always found one or two.  Became pissed and went on with his day.    \nHe started complaining of how tedious it was too get rid of all the coconuts all the time.    \nHe even stopped suspecting ME!  because i had help ;)    \n    \nEven after we moved out, we planted coconuts for YEARS in his flat, he now actually believe he is cursed or something... Because only him and his gf lives there now.    \nWell, i actually recruited his gf to be in to all of this.    \n    \n    \nOnce, he became so frustrated when he cleaned the kitchen and found two coconuts whilst alone, and had been alone for two weeks while his gf was abroad.    \nOne behind the oven and one in a small closed off dodge behind the kitchen fan.  You know, the space where there isn't any cabinets because of the kitchen fan tube?    \n    \nI had actually planted it there one year prior when two workers did some maintenance and picked the kitchen fan apart and changed some things.    \nYou can't get to that space unless you literally pick the space apart.    \n    \nApparently, he thought \"damn that place must be really dusty, i should clean it\" and picked the place apart, just to find another coconut.    \n    \nTo this day, 5 years later, i av still don't know if he have found all the coconuts i have hidden.    \nPerhaps one day, he will find the coconut i stuffed in his bathroom ventilation... \nHe have always complained it had a bad effect after i planned it, well... I'll let you know if he does.",

        "text": "Several years ago I worked at a major pet retail store. I had a morning shift that entailed me arriving a couple hours prior to the store opening to clean critter cages and feed the fish and animals and what not. \nThere was another crew that arrived earlier than I did that was in charge of restocking on delivery days twice a week.\nWe had community break room with the usual fridge, microwave, table and small lockers. There was also a snack machine and a Coke machine.\nI would keep snacks in my locker, but I really enjoyed Reese‚Äôs peanut butter cups chilled, so I kept a couple those, along with 2 bottles of Coca-cola in a mini-storage container in the fridge. \nI was happy to share as long as permission was asked. I bought my snack needs at Costco, so it was no big deal to share, and my coworkers always reimbursed me a little. It was cheaper to buy from me than the snack machines.\nOne day, I noticed I was missing a soda and candy bar from my little box in the fridge. No big deal other than no one had asked. They also didn‚Äôt leave any reimbursement. I blew it off figuring they must have really needed a pick me up and forgot to bring something.  \nThen it happened a couple more times. I put a note in the box requesting that if they wanted something that they needed to ask and not just take, and if they were going to just take, they needed to leave a couple dollars behind.\nI happened two more times before I came up with my plan to wreck their tastebuds.\nIt wasn‚Äôt that they were taking just one Coke, they were taking both and all the Reese‚Äôs PB cups. \nSince this was a pet store, we carried the nasty stuff that keeps dogs from licking themselves. It came in an ointment and a spray. We also had vinegar on hand for wiping down the acrylic fish tank fronts. It was something safe to use around aquarium fish, and we used it for a couple other things too.\nI carefully opened a bottle of Coca-cola, poured about a 1/3 out and replaced most of it with vinegar and the remainder with the bitter liquid. I then took some of the bitter ointment and smeared a thin layer along the top and screwed the lid back on. \nI locked the Reese‚Äôs in my locker and put the special bottle of Coke back in my box in the fridge. The trap was set and I just had to wait for the thief to take it. I suspected it was one of the early morning guys since the missing stuff always seemed to coincide with that shift.\nThe next morning when I came in, the bottle of Coke was gone. I wish I could have seen the look on his face when he took a sip of the specially prepared drink. I guarantee he tasted the bitter stuff everytime he licked his lips for the next couple hours. \nI left a new note in my storage box the next day, warning them that it would happen again if they stole from me. I never had missing drinks/snacks again.\n\nTLDR; Someone was stealing my candy and drinks so I tainted the drink with vinegar and the bitter stuff that keeps dogs from licking themselves.",

I got my new room assignment and I'm moving out this weekend. As I'm planning my move, I'm realizing that almost ALL of the shared stuff in our room is MINE. The fridge is MINE, the trash can is MINE, the vacuum is MINE, the pots/pans/cooking stuff is MINE, the cleaning supplies are MINE. My roommate and I both had fridges and we decided I'd bring mine and they would leave their's at home so now they're stuck without a fridge.

        "text": "My brother and I were reminiscing about this the other day, thought i'd share\n\nWhen I was about 10 or 11 in elementary school there was this kid that was bothering my younger brother. At the time my brother was around 6 or 7 years old. \n\nMy brother has always been the type of person who doesn't take shit from anyone while i'm usually the shy timid one. For whatever reason though my brother wasn't standing up for himself to this kid.\n\nThis kid was a year or two older that my brother and was making racists remarks to him. We're mixed, dads black and moms white. I can't remember exactly what the remarks were, because it's been over 10 years, but they offended my brother and he came home telling my family about it. \n\nSo I was absolutely not about to let this slide. One day at recess I approached this kid with my two friends and asked him \"what's your issue with my brother?\", guess the kid felt intimidated because we were older and ran away and ended up telling his teacher.\n\nThe kids teacher, who is one of the whitest ladies i've ever met her last name was literally \"Whitebread\" I kid you not, comes to my class and pulls me out to ask why I upset her student?\n\nI explained to her that he was making racists comments to my younger brother and it was upsetting him, all I did was ask him what his problem is.\n\nShe told me it's not my job to do that, and to leave it to the teachers to solve.\n\nCouple day's later i'm playing football (or soccer) with a bunch of kids in my grade and I decided to be the goalkeeper. Ball rolls to be, I decided to pick it up and drop kick it down the field.\n\nNow this kick was ass, and I kid you not the ball goes flying onto the pavement and hits the kid that was giving my brother a hard time spot on in the face.\n\nI kind of stood there for a second processing what just happened and was like \"oh shit\", some of my classmates and I then ran over to check if the kid was ok. The kid was crying and his nose was bleeding, we took him to the office to get some ice.\n\nI apologized to the kid because I did partly feel bad, but safe to say that kid never bothered my brother again.",

It‚Äôs basically a maze of hallways, and there are so many floors that the elevators take forever to pick you up. \n         As I was leaving, I had to wait five minutes for the first elevator to arrive. Unfortunately, when it opened, there were two very large men standing there with their arms folded; just staring at me unmoving. I‚Äôve seen this episode of BuzzFeed Unsolved before, so I decided to wait for the next one. \n         Nearly 10 minutes go by before the next elevator arrives, and when it does; there are three women standing in it. One of them leaves, and I exclaim ‚Äúoh FINALLY!‚Äù Before trying to rush to get in before the doors start closing. The two remaining women watch as I rush forward, reaching to stop the doors. Usually, one would push the button to keep the doors open- you know, basic human decency; but they couldn‚Äôt be bothered. \n         They watched as my hand got stuck in the elevator. They watched as they saw me begin panicking, trying to wrench my hand out before the elevator started moving. All the while, the button to open the doors is *right there*. Eventually, I was able to free my hand, leaving a four inch space in the door. \n           I then got to listen as the doors struggled to close again, and the elevator seemed to give up. Then, I got to hear them A.) realize they were stuck B.)Try and fail to make the doors close and C.) have to press the call button to get help\n\n           They were still stuck as the next elevator pulled up and I boarded, and they were still stuck as I left. All of this could have been avoided with the press of a button!\nTL,DR- Karens watch me rush to catch an elevator, let the doors close on my hand, and then get trapped in the elevator",

She never, ever found out it was me. And no one could figure out who did it. She was bad at blaming people. Never was there proof to any one of her words except for the math problems. Soon I had to stop because the more I did it, the more she looked like she was gonna punch someone, but I will tell you guys what the shrewd, short, ten-year-old did next in my next post. See you!",

She hated my narive language abd would constantly call me racial slurs because according to her my english was too good for a person born and brought up in India.\n\nI collected them all, the chalks . I then took the bag of chalks to the principal's office snd just dropped all of them on her desk because she had demanded proof and I fucking delivered! That eventually got the teacher an 8 month suspension.\n\nThe school was forced to hire 2 new teachers at this time because that one teacher used to teach multiple subjects and they needed a substitute for all of them. \n\nFrom here on it was absolute chaos foe the school. They had hired some German professor who was looking to be a foreign teacher in India. This gentleman was so pissed at the school's administration that he filed 2 lawsuits against the school before going back to Germany . The school lost both. \n\nThe lawsuits alarmed the parents and a lot of kids were pulled out from multiple classes right after this. The students who left started a facebook page where they started sharing their abuse stories from the teachers and even the principal. The school suffered a major financial aetback and eventually has to sell of one of their buildings to keep it functional.\n\nAll the chaos brought other teachers under scrutiny too. A male teacher had molested me in 6th grade. This bloke went to jail for money laundering for a few months. \n\nThen they hired another teacher who was really nice tho. She and me left that school in the same year and went to another school in the city , she as a teacher and me a student. She eventually went on to teach me in high school too and it was one of the best years of my life so far.",

When I walk in I notice that there's already two people in line and there's a person standing right by the door against the wall on their phone. (Not trying be an AH but I couldn't tell if this person was a male or female so I will refer to them as they).\n\nMe being the nice person I am, I asked if the person by the wall if they're in line? They reply to me no I'm not, so I join the line. \n\nSo the two people in front of me order and move over to the pick up area. I'm about to walk up to order and the person standing by the door cuts in front of me and starts ordering a drink. I LITERALLY ASKED THEM IF THEY WERE IN LINE, THEY SAID NO, AND THEY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO CUT IN FRONT OF ME?!?!\n\nThe worker taking the orders saw the whole ordeal go down and did absolutely NOTHING. The girl who was standing in front of me gave me a look like \"wtf\" cause she heard me ask this person if they were in line too.\n\nSo what do I do? I remain calm because I already knew how I was going to get my revenge. I place my order, even though I'm embarrassed asf because everyone saw that happen and stand in the pick up area. \n\nThe person who cut in front of me ran out to their car to do god knows what, so I casually walk over to the door while i'm waiting and take a peak to see what car is theirs. As i'm doing this my order number is called, as well as the person who cut in front of me. The employee puts both orders on the counter and then turns his back and begins talking to his co-worker while their preparing more orders.\n\nSo I strut up to the counter, grab both drinks, say \"thank you so much\" and walk out. \n\nAs i'm leaving that AH who cut me off is walking back in, and doesn't notice the drinks.\n\nSo I walk to my car and purposely pass his, when I do so I poke a hole with the straw and leave the drink face down on the hood of his BMW.\n\nI sit in my car a few meters away to watch this all go down. Guy comes out with a new drink because I guess he complained to the workers his was missing. See's the drink on his car, goes to pick it up and Taro slush starts spilling all over his hood.\n\nI'm in my car dying of laughter. Safe to say I do not regret it. That's what you get when you take someone's kindness for granted",

        "text": "SIL is the kind of mom that always has to one up other kids. She constantly talks about how her kids are smarter, taller, faster etc than her friends' kids. She literally bragged about them peeing more than her friends' kids when they were babies lol.\n\nIt was worse when my husband and I had our twins. Suddenly everything was a competition (that her kids always won). One of my girls rolled over at 4 months, her son had rolled over when he was just a week old. The twins both took their first steps around 13 months, her daughter was RUNNING at 4 months. (She didn‚Äôt actually start walking until around 16 months). She even changed the weight of her kids‚Äô birth weights which makes them both heavier than the current heaviest newborn in America. It‚Äôs so weird that she feels the need to tell such obvious lies, especially to people who know she‚Äôs lying because they were there when her kids were small.\n\nI got annoyed when she went from lying about her own kids to telling me there is something wrong with mine. The girls are a few months shy of 2 and they‚Äôre both healthy, on track and hitting their milestones. SIL has become OBSESSED with the idea that there is something wrong with them because they‚Äôre not speaking in long sentences. Of course they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre not even two! They‚Äôre both developmentally on track but she insists that her children were speaking in 5-6 word phrases by 18 months. (Spoiler - they were not). Honestly, her son is almost 7 and I can still barely understand a word the kid says.\n\nMy husband and I ignored her but she took it too far when I got a call from her friend who works in Early Intervention who was under the impression I was very concerned about my children. We talked and her friend confirmed that yes, they are on track and no, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.\n\nI finally lost my patience. Hey, her kids are breaking almost every record there is and that should be celebrated!\n\nWe had dinner with my husband‚Äôs family on Saturday (kids were in another room) and I decided it was the perfect time to give her my gift - a booklet I had printed and laminated called the ‚ÄòWhite Claw Book of World Records‚Äô. I printed all the supposed milestones of her kids, complete with photos and info of the actual world record holders now that they had been pushed to second place. She flipped through the first couple of pages, went beet red and called me an asshole. Her husband took it from her and got through the first page before laughing hysterically and asking her why the hell she was still lying? Apparently it was not the first time they‚Äôd talked about her lying about their kids.\n\nShe stormed out but texted me later that night and asked why I‚Äôd humiliated her when all she‚Äôd ever tried to do was help me get my kids the help they needed, but if that was how I wanted to treat her then she‚Äôd stop.\n\nSo I guess it‚Äôs a win for me!",

Guy is a little odd but nice enough and foots the bill for a new battery and off we go. Now mind you I know very little about cars so being that it wasn‚Äôt on fire or leaking fluids it seemed fine enough. I had budgeted some money for repairs since my intent was to buy an older beater, seeing as I don‚Äôt have a commute and live close to the city. I knew I‚Äôd have to spend a little bit on a couple things with this car that I could see, not a deal breaker.\n\nFast forward a couple days, and multiple reputable mechanics that I brought it to quote me nearly 3 grand on pretty exhaustive work and tell me it‚Äôs not worth wasting money on. Fuck, okay. Lemon laws do exist, but the mileage on this car is well out of the terms of those laws in my state, so my only hope is to try and Hail Mary my way back out of this shitty deal. I reach out to the guy and tell him I want to bring the car back as he lied in the listing and in person about the driveability of the car. (insisted the car was in great shape and would only need some cosmetic work and minor stuff a high miles, older car typically does. I only have this dude‚Äôs word as far as some of the mechanical shit goes) he absolutely flips out, loses his fucking mind and gets super aggro about it. Before he hangs up he gives me his mechanic‚Äôs number and says that‚Äôs his best friend and he only trusts that guy‚Äôs word. I think to myself, why the fuck would I call your sketchy friend but leave him a message anyway because I have nothing to lose on this hunk of shit now.\n\nCouple days later the mechanic calls me, I start to shut it down by saying ‚Äúwell your shitty friend fucking fleeced me so I don‚Äôt think we have much to say to each other,‚Äù he stops me, wait don‚Äôt hang up. Turns out, they are most certainly not friends, he‚Äôs just a terrible customer who he continually passes lemon cars off to once he sells them and has people breathing down his neck about it. He‚Äôs sick of having this happen and tells me that he only agreed to continue working on cars for his dealership if the dude‚Äôs card stays on file, so here‚Äôs the deal. Bring the car to his shop, he‚Äôs gonna do everything, and I mean everything. All the work including the non essential stuff, take to it get inspected the works. Scumbag gets the bill and if he doesn‚Äôt like it, good fucking luck finding another mechanic willing to cut you deals and put up with your roided out psycho ass. The repairs total out to more than I even paid him for the car. I‚Äôm picking up it up in a couple days and the mechanic and I both get our revenge after a few weeks of torment. Who‚Äôs the sucker now you fucking dickhead",

Many comments here were useful.\nOk so acetone and brake fluid DON'T leave stain in the paint, I even tested it in my car and it did nothing, even when you leave the product sitting overnight it just does nothing.\nLast weekend my husband wanted to make a nice dinner for my sister in law and her daughter (11yo), so I went to their house to pick them, she saw the scratch and asked what happened (I told it was pretty noticeable) I told her and then we didn't mention the subject again and just enjoied the dinner my husband made for us.\nSo after some beers and etc my sister in law said that if kids can do whatever they want so can her daughter, so my niece (while we watched her trough the camera in my phone app) crossed the street and did the exactly same thing my neighbors kid did. IDK if it was the alcohol but it was pretty fun and satisfactory to watch her doing it. It was like 9pm so she came back we just laughed (she did loved it too, she wanted to go back and scratch it more but we didn't allow it ofc), ok so we took them back home and when I was back it was like 2am and I was sober but wasn't satisfied anymore, so I went inside and took my sewing kit and got many small needles.\nI went outside and did a lot of micro holes in his tires, so when he less expects his tires will be flat and the only solution will be to buy 4 new tires.\nHe saw the scratch and went to comfront me I said I didn't do it and he could check my footage or other neighbors footage to see, he said he didn't need that bc he knew it was me. I was like ok whatever, your kid did the same so why you complaining? I pay yours if you pay mine. He was mad but he didn't say nothing else because he knew he did me wrong too.\nOf course he didn't see the tires because it was very small holes, but now he will have to fill the tires more often and will be wondering why.",

It was not obstructing anyones drive or the pavement and I am not really familiar with any of the neighbours yet. The parking seems to be a bit of a free for all and I don‚Äôt think reasonably anyone could expect to be entitled to the spot right outside their house although I assume some some may feel they are.

I've been commuting over a year to my job via these roads and have only seen a cop car on two occasions, this being the second one.\n\nSo I'm driving at a very reasonable speed, the speed limit in this specific area we were in was 60km/h and I was going 70km/h. I'm passing by a bunch of houses in a subdivision, and i'm always careful in this area and reduce my speed because this is where I saw the cop car that once time.\n\nThe idiot behind me was RIDING MY ASS though. Like getting so close to my bumper, swerving over to see if he could pass, which he couldn't because there were cars driving on the other side of the road. It was starting to really piss me off.\n\nI'm driving irritated, guy behind me is still riding my ass and swerving. I start reducing my speed to drive exactly the speed limit, to be an AH and because I was in no rush.\n\nFinally the road brakes off into two lanes, and one of those lanes is a left turning lane.\n\nAll of a sudden the idiot behind me speeds up into that lane to pass my car. Which is illegal. The idiot speeds off like going 50-60kms over the speed limit and makes sure to look over at my and flip me off while he passes me.\n\nI kid you not all of a sudden a car in the opposite lane from us makes a complete U-turn and starts chasing after the idiot, it's a fucking cop car.\n\nEnds up pulling the guy over, I see this whole ordeal and start dying of laughter. As I'm driving by them I roll my window down and flip off the guy.",

        "text": "My family is pretty complex but I (46f) have always been the scapegoat child that my narcissistic mom blames all of her troubles on. My parents are divorced and remarried to others but in the past she had really been awful to me in private and acted like the best mom ever around others. Additionally, anytime we would fight she would preemptively tell my dads, stepmom and brothers about it from her perspective first making me sound emotional, unhinged and crazy so that no one would believe me if I tried to ask for understanding or help.   \nMy stepmom was the only one that believed me because she took the time to get to know me and knew that what my mom was saying didn't line up with my character. She was my light in the darkness through years and years of this, but she couldn't convince my dad otherwise.   \nThere were times my mom would scream at me and trash me to my face then call my brothers crying that I was being so mean to her so they would gang up on me and give me \"a talking to\" for how I treated mom.   \nI'm not one to cry easily or throw emotional fits because I've learned to just hide my feelings and stonewall my mother to avoid giving her anything to talk about, but one day my brothers called me and I said, \"You have no idea what I've been through. When our parents divorced when we were kids one of you went to live with dad and the other with grandma. I was stuck with her through divorce, remarriage, fighting with her new husband, her having more kids, postpartum depression - all of it I was stuck with her while you guys were off living your best lives.\" After that conversation my brothers stopped trying to bother me about fights with mom, but my mom's friends and my dad still often bothered me about it. \n\nFast forward to my first pregnancy with my son when I was 36. I had high blood pressure and she kept screaming at me for how I wanted to birth and raise my child. I finally told her I have high blood pressure and she's making it worse so I'm going to go no contact during the pregnancy and if she can get her s$%@ together, she can meet the baby when he's born.   \nShe deleted me on Facebook as her friend and told all of her friends and our family that I accused her of trying to kill my unborn child .(big eye roll) \n\nMy dad came over to talk to me about it and luckily my stepmom came with him. I explained about no contact and that I wasn't going to change my mind since the baby's health was more important. My dad eventually gave up and my stepmom urged him to just accept it that this was for the best. \n\nCloser to the birth, I had a baby shower that my sister-in-law threw. She asked if she should invite my mom. I said that it was ok since there would be so many people there, I wouldn't likely spend any one-on-one time with her. And it was a huge shower My mom's best friend even drove up for it and she lives four hours away. \n\nTowards the end of the shower, my mom cornered me with her best friend and they didn't know that my stepmom had been videoing a lot of the shower and when she saw this, she turned her phone camera on the three of us. \n\nMom started asking questions about the pregnancy and birth and her best friend goes, \"She's put all that on Facebook haven't you seen it?\"\n\nI said, \"she removed me as her Facebook friend.\"\n\nMy mom's face turned bright red. I said, \"I'll add you back if you want to read all the updates about the pregnancy.\"\n\nShe said, \"Okay.\"\n\nHer friend turned to her and asked why she deleted me. She said we got into a fight and she was trying to punish me for not listening. Her best friend knows her well and says, \"It sounds like you punished yourself instead.\"\n\nWhen my stepmom got home she played the video for my dad. He had never seen her that way before and he never accused me of mistreating my mom again - he mostly just stayed out of it. \n\nEven better - a couple of days before my son was born my mom called me begging to be a part of her grandchildren's lives. I said, \"let me think about it.\" I called her back the day I was going in to give birth to my son and said, \"I'm willing to allow you to see the kids when I'm around, but there will be rules.\" I sent her a list of 7 rules she had to follow including things like: never talk negatively about me or my husband around the kids, never bring up the past between us, no more trying to control my decisions, etc.. I told her I wouldn't hesitate to kick her out of our lives for good if she broke the rules. \n\nThe kids are now 7 &amp; 9 years old and she has never broken a single rule. She wanted grandchildren more than she wanted to use me as a scapegoat. They've never been left alone with her - me or my husband will continue to be present as they spend time with her - but she has been a decent grandma to them and has kept the agreement 100%.",

I didn't think much of it but I still felt something was a little off when I got back and he came to see me. After a few weeks of uncomfortable silence he finally admitted it to me this weekend. I immediately started crying and I went into a pit of dispare. So fast forward a few days forward after I calmed down a little, I sat and thought what would be the best form of revenge so he learns his lesson forever? I went to his best friend who runs a \"modeling\" agency and seduced him knowing he would cave in. The same day I asked him to help me set up my modeling account, I gave a free trail to him and all his friends. Did my revenge go too far? &gt;:)",

When the police got to the cabin they found that he nailed fishing hooks along the perimeter of the inside of the cabin windows. They told him that he couldn't set up traps to catch people like that and he could be charged with bodily harm.\n\nThe old guy said \"Officer, those are *my* fish hooks and I don't want them to rust. I will dry them where I damn well please.\"\n\nThe break-ins stopped after that.",
