They moved out of the apartment, and left all these ugly white boxes on the windows and doors. I need you to send someone to come remove them now. I'm tired of looking at them.\n\nM: I see. I'd be happy to walk you through removing the devices, but I wouldn't be able to send a technician to dismantle the system on an out of service account.\n\nC: What? You think I'm going to do it? \n\nM: I apologize for the inconvenience ma'am, but we can walk you through the steps. Or maybe if you have someone that can help you we can walk them through it. It should only take a few minutes of your time.\n\nC: (yelling at this point) Dont you apologize to me! You're not sorry and you're not the one who has to look at these ugly boxes the lazy (insert multiple expletives here) left here when they moved. You're going to send someone out by tomorrow to have this down.\n\nM: Maam, I understand your frustration, but again, I'm unable to send someone out. We are always here to help if you would like us to walk you through it. Or maybe you can reach out to your apartment manager since they allowed the system to be installed.\n\nC: What's your name again?\n\nM: My name is ....\n\nC: Good I am holding you personally responsible, and tonight I am going to blast you and your company. Everyone will know what you're doing to me. Your name will be everywhere. \n\nM: Okay, did you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nC: BLAST YOU!\n\nClick \n\nI didn't even get to thank her for calling, but I had to laugh at the end of that call. Keep in mind, the boxes she was talking about are very small and are all wireless. Nothing is nailed/screwed in. \n",

I've been working in customer service for a year and *hot damn* I already resonate with so many stories from this sub.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI'll be Me and she'll be Completely Confused (CC). \n\nMe: You've reached bjlmag, a SUP in the Car department, can I have your name &amp; member info please?\n\n*Several minutes of blind ranting pass before she finally gives her information*\n\nCC: I just picked up my car and it was terrible; they didn't even ask if my husband would drive!! I can't drive for 10 hours all by myself; he gonna drive whether they like it or not!\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, are you still close to the location? If you can go back, they can add him onto the contract. If he isn't added to the contract, though, he cannot drive the vehicle.\n\nCC: He's not here!\n\nMe: Was he with you when you arrived to pick up the car?\n\nCC: NO\n\nMe: Did you tell them that you wanted to add another driver?\n\nCC: NO! They should know! You need to do it now;I won't go back there. They wasted my time and the manager is just a bitch!\n\n*slams head into desk*\n\nMe: Unfortunately maam I don't work for the rental company so I cannot make such changes on my end. Furthermore, he will need to be present to sign the contract and provide his driver's license, which can't be done on the phone. If you aren't close to where you rented the car I could try finding another nearby location for you? \n\nCC: NO, you're WRONG! They told me on the phone he don't need no driver's license!\n\nMe: I'm sorry maam but that isn't correct, I apologize if you were misinformed but a driver's license is required to drive a rental car. \n\nCC: You're just no help! They told me he don't need no license! You just need his name and birthday, are you going to help me or not?\n\nMe: I'm sorry maam, but he will need to provide a driver's license and sign a contract in order to drive the vehicle. \n\nCC: NO NO NO THEY SAID THAT! THEY SAID ON THE PHONE THEY JUST NEED HIS NAME AND BIRTHDAY!\n\nMe: Maam, this is a matter of law. If somebody told you that a driver's license isn't required to drive a motor vehicle, they were not correct. I'd be happy to help you find a location where you can add your husband to your contract, but he will need to provide his driver's license before signing the contract. \n\nCC: Get me a supervisor NOW! \n\nMe: I am a supervisor, maam.\n\n*CC mutters profanity and hangs up*\n\nI wish I could say it's rare that people think they can drive rental cars without a license but we have to explain this pretty regularly. I've got plenty more outrageous stories; the travel  industry is rowdy. \n\n\n\n",

I told her I would be happy to wait with her as long as the hold didn’t become excessive and she was happy for the help because of her lack of understanding of the investing world. During our hold, as I’m sure you all are familiar with, a nice sounding lady would break through the hold music and say something like, “Your call is important to us, all of our representatives are assisting other callers. Please continue holding and a representative will be with you shortly.” The lady I’m working with then RESPONDS TO THE RECORDING saying “oh thank you, I’m ready to get this over with.” I keep my laughter from coming out the first time it happened, but the second time when she responded to THE EXACT SAME RECORDING with, “I’m not sure if I believe you, it’s starting to take a while” I could not hold it in and had to use the mute button for what God made the mute button for, laughing at people that don’t use the computer and have to call in the first place. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ",

        "text": "\n\nJust realised I have a story for here! Worked at a UK based debt recovery agency. Collecting council tax, mobile phone bills etc. Was a student at the time so I worked evenings from 5-8pm. We collected council tax arrears/set up payment plans for a local authority debts. There were only 2 of us on each evening so you can imagine we were swamped. People queueing for 15+ minutes on busy nights. Not acceptable but hey, not my fault. \n\nFull time staff got bonuses for debts recovered whereas part time staff did not. Anyway - no way I wanted to profit from someone else’s stress! I was honest with people - Scottish law stated that council tax isn’t a debt and therefore we can’t evict you or prosecute you. Most people didn’t know this. \n\nI would speak to wee old women with a part time cleaning jobs who had run into hard times and were trying to pay their arrears. Tears down the phone. I always tried to help. Said to make sure their rent was paid first to ensure they weren’t evicted. Asked what they could afford to pay (£50 a week? Are you sure? Wouldn’t you be more comfortable with £5-£10 per week? You know you can pay the arrears over 2 years, don’t you? ;-)).  Once I’d set the plan up online and they kept paying it, we stopped chasing them, even if it was just £5 a week.\n\nAnyway - one evening I took a call at around 7.55pm just before closing time (we were to sign off and the office closed at 8pm - didn’t matter who was queueing!). Received abuse - shouting, swearing down the phone from someone irate at holding for 15 minutes. Honestly, i didn’t blame them. I told them I was sorry for the wait, appreciated they were upset and hoped I could resolve their issues quickly and set up a reasonable payment plan to make sure the recovery agents left them alone and they could still afford to live. They kept cursing and swearing about the wait, said we knew we closed in 2 minutes and the queue was 15 minutes long so I wasn’t going anywhere until I listened to them. I stated I wanted to help but wouldn’t listen to any more abuse down the phone and would hang up if they continued. They said they would just call back again (15 minutes wait, we closed in 2 minutes), so I told them “Good Luck with that!) and hung up. \n\nBack of the queue for you, doll!",

This guy today just made me so heated I had to write about it. \n\nI work for a luxury car brand that offers connectivity services for a subscription, so we handle billing and technical support. Been here almost a year and a half and recently got promoted to another department (thank god!) so I’m only here a few more weeks. My tolerance level is so low at this point and I’m just over it. \n\nAnyways caller is rude guy or RG and I’ll be me. \n\nHe was warm transferred to me from general customer service so I had all his info already. He wanted to buy a subscription and then put in like a hold while his account was getting approved for goodwill time. Essentially he wanted to buy a subscription and then get a refund if he’s awarded credits. The plans are non refundable and we can’t do this for his type of car. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling company this i-(he cut me off and kept doing it)\n\nRG: Hello?! \n\nMe: Hi this is Chrissibreeee how ca-\n\nRG: Hello, yes hi Chrissibreee I need to ask you some questions. \n\nMe: yes sir I have your account all pulled up already and-\n\nRG: yeah I was wondering how I can buy services and then put it on a hold if they give me the extra time I’m supposed to get? \n\nMe: well sir unfortunately we won’t be able to do that there’s not a way we can suspend or hold the subscription. \n\nRG: You can. You’re just saying you won’t. \n\nMe: unfortunately no sir there isn’t a wa-\n\nRG: Hello??\n\nMe: Yes sir still here. \n\nRG: Ugh there’s such a delay you must be in India or something.

Are you going to tell me why I can’t suspend my subscription or not.?\n\n((Now I’m heated))\n\nMe: Its in our terms and conditions when you purchase a plan that it’s non refundable. There’s also no possible way we can suspend it after it’s been purchased. There is no option to do that. \n\nRG: I work in technology and I know it can be done. Sirius can do it I don’t believe you when you say you can’t. \n\nMe: sir I understand how frus-\n\nRG: Nope I’m just going believe that YOU are refusing to do this for me so have a great freaking day!

Friend or family member; neighborhood handyman can install one.  I’m not a magic fairy here— as much as I wish I could Mr. Sir, I can’t give you a credit for the jack, sorry.  \n\nContinues to go on and on about what he was “told” by my company, then he talks about his kids, his life etc. \n\nFinally towards the end of the call the customer starts talking about races and ethnicities and certain races owning businesses and having nice cars. Politely told the gentleman (as I was boiling inside) that this is “not a conversation for the phone company” \n\nHe didn’t like that. Lol he told me that I clearly didn’t want to help him. \n\nI’m the bad guy, because I won’t waive your $90 charge- but you deserve it, you’re a loyal customer who won’t do business with Asian people or Jewish people? \n\nI’m sorry but wth is wrong with people. \n",

As a chat company without the requirement to sign in before talking to someone, we got a LOT of prank chats. (Especially when Kanye released that jumped over jump man bullshit. Everyone thought they were SO original)\n\nOne dude, though, took the cake in my opinion. Enter Creepy Sock Guy, or CSG for the purposes of this story.\n\nNow CSG started the chats off normally, asking about products, talking about the activities he liked to do, asking what products would be good for him and then things took a for the wierd. The biggest reason we all knew him was because he chatted in, literally, every single goddamn day at all different hours. \n\nWe could tell something was up because people kept getting disconnected on immediately if they had a guy’s name at first. After a few months, he either stopped being picky or learned something about himself. We were all in the same room so we could tell others to look out for X customer.\n\nAnyhoodles! After the normal seeming foreplay he would start asking how the socks feel. “Do they hug your feet?” “Do you run a lot in them?” “Do they get too sweaty?”\n\nNever anything explicit, but DEFINITELY KINKY. Over time we collectivey found the one phrase that would make him disconnect immediately “Oh! I don’t wear socks.”\n\nAnd that worked... For a while. Then he started to get creative since everyone working at the checkmark company suddenly stopped wearing socks. He changed tack and asked about shoes you don’t need to wear socks with. Same questions, same kink, different subject matter. We worked around that by eventually resorting to “Exclusively wearing flip flops because of a medical condition so our feet are nasty please leave.”\n\nThis was a few years ago, so I’m not sure if he still does it, but wherever you are, CSG... I hope you found a different outlet for your fetish and know that if you weren’t harrassing people while they just tried to work, then you would be valid. As it stands fuck you, and the socks you walked in on... Wait shit no I take that back don’t fuck the socks you kinky sunuvabich.",

It's right next to one of my standard queues so I didn't notice. \n\nThe next 2 hours no one received any calls. They actually sent me home early as I wasn't needed due to the lack of calls. \n\nToday I showed up for work and it was pretty slow. Most people tend to think we're closed on Memorial Day.

        "text": "(So for informational purposes, I work for a health insurance company. I make outbound calls to members to let them know about different programs that are on their health plans that they aren't utilizing. In this situation I am calling about services the doctor ordered and cheaper places to get that service done. Sometimes the member I call for is an adult that is still on their parents plans. Like this one which happened earlier this week.)\n\nMe: Hello, my name is Torrey I'm calling with INSURANCE for *24 year old woman's name*?\n\nMother: This is her mother.\n\nMe: Is *daughter* available to speak with me?\n\nMother: No, she isn't, but it's my insurance. What's this about?\n\nMe: I was calling to give her some important information about some services ordered for her by her doctor. Can I leave a number for her to callback, or would there be a better time to callback later?\n\n(This is all we are allowed to say, this is what we can leave on voicemail, if the person who answers already knows which services I'm talking about and can verify 2 pieces of information then I can talk, otherwise I absolutely need the person we were calling for to give permission first. This is due to HIPAA.)\n\nMother: I am her MOTHER and it is MY PLAN. What exactly is this about?\n\nMe: *explains policy* Are you aware of which services I am calling about?\n\nMother: I shouldn't have to, I am her MOTHER and it is MY PLAN and you WILL tell me what this call is about.\n\nMe: *explians policy* Again this is to adhere to HIPAA guidelines. Since you don't know which services I am calling about would there be a better time to callback or a different number to reach *daughter* directly?\n\nMother: No, it is MY PLAN and I pay for it, it is through MY WORK, and I am *daughter's* MOTHER and I don't care about HIPPA, YOU WILL TELL ME WHY YOU ARE CALLING. She is ONLY 24, I know more about the plan, I can answer any questions better than she can, I am HER MOTHER, and she is ONLY 24 YEARS OLD.\n\nMe: I really do need to talk to-\n\nMother: No, let me ask you this. Would you have been able to answer questions about health insurance back when you were 24?SHE IS ONLY 24, SHE IS A CHILD. Would you?\n\nMe: Well, umm-\n\nMother: See you wouldn't would you, so you should just talk to me.\n\nMe: I really do need to speak to *daughter* as it is personal health information.\n\nMother: WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN YOU WERE 24? HMM?\n\n(Seriously like she made this really loud humming sound.)\n\nMe: Well I can let you know in a year and a half when I turn 24 if you like. However, in the mean time it is personal health information and I need to speak with *daughter*. Would there be a better time or number to call?\n\nMother: Well your age is beside the point, I don't need to know that, it's irrelevant, you can speak to me or you can speak to no one.\n\n(This is delivered in a smug way like I'll just have to violate the law for her now.)\n\nMe: Alright, thank you for your time. I'll go ahead and remove this case from our queue, you won't be getting any more calls.\n\nMother: Wait- \n\n*click* I hang up\n\n(Joke is on her I was calling to let the daughter know there was a place to get the service done across the street from the current place that is literally 1/5 the cost.)\n\nEdit: Normally I would callback at least once. However right now our queue of people to call is almost double what it usually is and our new trainees won't hit the floor for 2 weeks. So considering there are already people that we might not be able to get to before they have their own procedures, no I am not wasting time calling when she wouldn't give me a time or take a message or anything.

Just shopping around, looking for auto insurance that's cheaper than USAA. (Hint, he's never going to find it).\n\nWe're going over driving info and wants to add his new wife.\n\nMe = me; NOM = nice old man.\n\n&gt;Me: Ok, and what is your wife's date of birth?\n\n&gt;NOM: Hmm, well... I'm not quite sure. We're freshly married so we're not all that familiar yet! \n\nLike... you're married but you don't even know her birthday? Ok.\n\n&gt;NOM: Oh! But I know it's on Thanksgiving! It's on Thanksgiving every year! What day is Thanksgiving?\n\n&gt;Me: (not surprised he would say something like this with how the call was going so far) Well, Thanksgiving is on a different date each year, as it's on the last Thursday of every year.\n\n&gt;NOM: Last Thursday? Ok yeah what day is that?\n\nAt this point I'm just sitting there, head in my hands.\n\n&gt;NOM: (some shuffling sounds) Ok last Thursday... the 23rd! Her birthday is November 23rd. \n\n&gt;Me: (I give up at this point, as I know he's not gonna buy) Ok, and the year?\n\n&gt;NOM: Oh... Well now I don't rightly know that... I know she just turn 34 this year.\n\nWe are in May. No where near November yet. \n\n&gt;Me: Ok so about 1983?\n\n&gt;NOM: Yeah yeah that sound right!\n\nAnd the rest of the call goes on like this for 75% of his information. My head was about to explode when we were going over his coverages. \n\nNice guy, just is very clueless on things.",

How can I help you?\n\nStoner dude: Yeah, um hey, I’m good thank you. Yeah I was wondering if I could get a loan?\n\nMe: Okay, great. Could you give me some more information on what type of loan you’re after, such as the amount and what it’s for?\n\nST: Nah okay so I was thinking like, cause I saw your savings accounts were pretty good, that maybe I could borrow like $5000 and just put it straight into a savings account. I sort of want to buy a house soon so I guess this is where I need to start.\n\nMe: I’m sorry Stoner but the interest rate you pay to maintain the loan will always be higher than the interest rate we pay on savings accounts so you’ll be losing money. *this was explained among other things, like the fact that we don’t give out money for no reason*\n\nST: Nah there’s no way that could be legal. That’s just not fair. I was going to buy a house soon but there’s no way I’m using you guys anymore but that’s cool. I only need $5000 more until I have enough money anyway that’s why I was asking.\n\nMe: Oh okay, it might be possible to earn interest on the rest of the money you have?\n\nST: Nah man, people steal from me enough. I don’t need that bank stealing from me too and I’ve got like $467k. Your loss. Hope the CEO is listening.

Somehow, our customers do, and I tell you, there's no pleasing them, left or right.\n\nI get a call this morning from some guy who says he wants to close his account and I ask him, politely, why, so I could annotate it in the account closure.  He says he found out my company supports \"the administration.\"  \"As in the Trump administration?\"  \"Yes.\"  This was news to me.  But whatever, the guy wants to close his account, then that's his prerogative.\n\nA few hours go by and I get another phone call from someone on the opposite end of the political spectrum.  One of our cards is being sold to another banking company.  This card belongs to a store that's known for outdoors equipment and hunting stuff.  This guy's a bit angry (he's not yelling, but he's got a tone) because said bank has announced publicly that they won't fund the NRA or gun right's groups, and because this bank is taking over the credit card for the hunting store, he wants to cancel his account.\n\nI had a good laugh at that when I was done with him.  Seems like no matter what a company does in public, someone on both sides of the political spectrum is going to be offended.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP and all the fun stuff. English isn't my first language either so excuse any awkward phrasing. \n\n\nI've pretty much purged all my memory of my short stint in a certain call centre company (I'm in chat support now and infinitely less stressed) but this one stuck.\n\nBackground: Telco company, our job description is to handle billing and general inquiry. We were also front-liners, meaning we're the one who receives most of the calls then transfer them to the appropriate department. The thing is, we weren't allowed to transfer until we are sure that it is something that we cannot handle on our end and we've exhausted absolutely all resources that we have. Since we were (briefly) trained for all general product knowledge and we have are all able to access all the tools other department uses, we've somehow became tech support, retentions, collections, fraud prevention and therapist while the other departments do jack shit. But enough with that rant.\n\n\nIt was my last customer of the day. The call came in two seconds before I was allowed to hit \"away\" and close my system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cx: Hi there. For the past few days I haven't been able to receive calls. I've already missed some important business calls and it's very distressing. I hope you can help.\n\nShe was very polite, and in these cases, a quick reset of network settings usually do the trick. I thought I was actually going to get home early. Boy, I was wrong.\n\nWe went through the usual troubleshooting steps. Stuff like checking if other services like data was working (it was) and then tweaking the network settings, etc. It became immediately apparent that she was wasn't the most technologically literate, putting it gently. She didn't know how to use her phone much beyond making calls and emails. It took us minutes to help her navigate into Settings, and even longer to navigate to her to Network. She wasn't using a phone we sell, and I had to watch a Youtube video to help her navigate. I had to describe the icons to her (\"It's the blue icon with a picture of a gear on the top right of the screen that says Settings underneath\") and to tell her where to tap (\"Now, tap the third item on the screen, then on the top of the screen it should read XXX and you should see XXX\"), because technology apparently renders wealthy, intelligent businessmen illiterate. She would also mess up a few times and we had to start over (she didn't even know how to go to the home screen), and go through the whole process again because she couldn't remember anything. \n\nA call that usually takes 20 minutes max took us almost two hours, and we weren't even paid OT if we had a long call because it was always our fault somehow, and it was well past my shift. She was still very polite and patient and apologetic for her stupidity. When we've done all that I had the energy to do, I asked her if she has another phone she can use to call herself to check if it's working now. She said she doesn't. I just gave up, and told her to end the call and I'll ring her back. If she was able receive the call, then that means issue resolved. If not, then she can just call back to try more steps but she can be someone else's problem.\n\nI did my notes and called her back. She picked up after three rings. I almost cried.\n\n&gt; Me: This is white_lady from XXX Mobile. I'm glad to see you're able to receive calls now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cx: Wait, I'm still not receiving calls!\n\nMy soul pretty much left my body at that point. I told her that if she was able to hear her phone ring and accept the call, that means her issue if fixed.\n\n&gt; Cx: Well, you see, I was able to answer your call because I was looking at my screen. It only rang very faintly. I wouldn't be able to do that all the time. This has been my problem for the past days, I haven't been receiving calls and when I check my phone at the end of the day I already have several missed calls!\n\nI stared at the screen for 20 seconds straight without saying anything. I then quickly guided to adjusting the volume of incoming calls. I told her I would call her back, didn't even get her permission, just hung up and redialed. She answered after the fifth ring.\n\n&gt; Cx: It's working now! You're an absolute angel, thank you!\n\nOn hindsight, I should have probed more before getting into it. She didn't even leave a satisfied survey.",

How can I help?\n\n\n**Customer:** You can f****** explain why you have sent me a Type A product, when your website clearly states it is a Type B. Your website says Type B, but the packaging says Type A. How the f*** do I know which one to trust?\n\n\n**Me:** I would go by the information on the packaging as that has been printed by the manufacturer. I can only apologise if there has been a mistake on our website. If this is the case, I will see what we can do to get this sorted for you.\n\n\n*I go through the usual finding his order and security checks*\n\n\n**Me:** So just to confirm, you are looking at [product], yes?\n\n\n**Customer:** Yeah that one.\n\n\n**Me:** Ok, I am looking at the product on our website now, and it is stating that this is a Type A product, and we have not made any changes to this page for over 3 years.\n\n\n**Customer:** Don't f****** lie to me. I am looking at the website right now And it says Type B.\n\n\n*(By this point I am very confused, as this is one of our more popular products and someone else really would have complained by now if we had the incorrect information on our website)*\n\n\n**Me:** Ok... My screen is definitely stating Type A. Could you please confirm the exact address of the webpage you are looking at?\n\n\n**Customer:** www.OneOfOurMainCompetitors.com/therestoftheurl\n\n\n**Me:** Ok, thank you. I see what the problem is here. You were looking at the information on [competitors] site, which has the incorrect information on there. If you check our site, you will see that it states Type A. If the product is still in the original packaging, we would be happy for you to send it back and swap it for another type B product at the same price.\n\n\n**Customer:** What do you mean, YOUR site? I AM on your site.\n\n\n**Me:** No, you are looking at [competitor's] site. We are [company].\n\n\n**Customer:** Why the f*** did you send me stuff then?\n\n\n**Me:** Because you placed an order on our website and paid for it?\n\n\n**Customer:** No, I didn't.\n\n\n**Me:** Yes, you did. \n\n\n**Customer:** No I didn't!\n\n\n**Me:** You placed an order on our website at [lists the date, time, email address, and last 4 digits of his card number]. We would not have that information if you didn't place an order with us.\n\n\n**Customer:** But I placed the order with [competitor]. So how the hell would you have my details? Did you steal them? How are you connected to them? WHY DID YOU STEAL MY ORDER FROM THEM, I NEVER WANTED TO DEAL WITH YOUR COMPANY IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n\n\n**Me:** We have no connection to them whatsoever, and we have no way of stealing orders from any other company. You placed your order on our website. \n\n\n**Customer:** If I was ordering through [competitor] then how do you explain the fact that you now have my order?\n\n\n**Me:** Perhaps you had multiple tabs open at the same time on your browser and selected ours by accident?\n\n\n**Customer:** *Sweary rant about he still doesn't believe he placed the order with us, and we are scam artists and thieves, which is why he didn't want to order from us in the first place* You have my money. Send me a Type B for the same price as what I paid for in the post today.\n\n\n**Me:** As our website was correct and this is not an error on our part, you will need to place and pay for another order and I can fast track it to make sure it goes out in tomorrow's post for you, or send the Type A back to us so that we can exchange it for you.\n\n\n**Customer:** What the f****** f***! Send me a Type B today, for free. NOW.\n\n\n**Me:** If this was an error on our end, we would. However, as we have established that you were looking at the wrong website and ours has the correct information on, your 2 options are to either return the product to us for an exchange, or to place a new order with us for the correct item.\n\n\n**Customer:** *another delightfully sweary rant before hanging up*\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "So I just had to share this little gem from a few weeks ago. I work in a clinic helping patients with insurance issues. A co-worker sent me the information of a patient who was in a very tough spot. She was disabled and had Medicaid through her disability.\n\nShe had congestive heart failure and as well as a plethora of other health conditions and was in need of a large amount of follow-up appointments and referrals. Unfortunately, Medicaid obtained through disability in our state only pays for a maximum of 12 doctor's appointments per fiscal year. \n\nI called up the patient to get some more information about her income and assets to see if she might qualify for another Medicaid category that didn't have appointment limits. After speaking with her for a few minutes I determine that she could potentially qualify for another type of Medicaid without limits; however, it would have required her to give up her disability determination from Social Security as well as her disability income which she didn't want to do.\n\nShe starts to get hysterical and tearful and rant about how she’s a good citizen that doesn’t want go be a leech and she’s always falling through the cracks and I truly felt sad and sorry for her. All my sympathy went out the window when she came out with this line though:\n\n\"If I was a minority or an illegal I would get all those benefits no problem. But no! Because I'm a decent person who follows the law and happens to be white, I get nothing while all the benefits goes to those who don't deserve it.\"\n\nNever mind that illegal aliens cannot obtain any benefits in my state, but yeah whatever lady. You do you.  ",

Apologies for the post format, I’m typing this on my phone and it’s a bit late.\n\n{Me} = me\n{Guy} = customer\n\n{Guy} calls customer support line.\n\nMe: Thanks for calling {Shop}, this is {Me}. How may I help you?\n\nGuy: FINALLY. That took you forever. I’ve been on hold for THREE minutes. I demand you fix my problem now.\n\nI chuckle a bit inside. ‘Oh, one of those people’, I think. ‘I can handle those.’\n\nMe: Well, I’m glad you got through to someone after that long wait. Could you tell me more about this problem you mentioned?\n\nWell, the customer wasn’t wrong for being a little upset. He ordered a +/- $150 product 5 days ago, and it still hadn’t showed up even though it was in stock and we usually do next-day delivery.\n\nGuy: I’d like to cancel my order and get my money back. NOW.\n\nMe: *looks in order system* Well, sir, I totally understand. You’ve been waiting long. However, this product is in possession of the postal service, I can’t reimburse you for something we haven’t received back yet. I’m happy to contact the postal service to ask if they can send the product back to us, but I can’t pay you before it’s back.\n\nThe customer doesn’t quite explode, but sort of slowly melts like a broken lava lamp. In other words: it became a hot mess.\n\nGuy: I’ve been on the phone all week to get this sorted, and everybody’s been telling me the same story. I want to have my money. NOW.\n\nMe: I understand, sir, and I will do anything in my power to pay you as soon as we have the product back. But we are a company, not a charit—\n\nGuy: I don’t care about that. I want my MONEY. How about this: I’ll come visit {Local Store} tomorrow and make a mess of the place. HOW ABOUT THAT?\n\nMe: [short pause] Sir, you do know these conversations are being recorded, right?\n\nGuy: I will not have myself be THREATENED like that. How dare you! You’ve done NOTHING for me. GET ME MY MONEY.\n\nAfter making the necessary arrangements and information requests for this customer’s payout, I made sure to make a detailed log, save the incident number in my notepad and keep an eye on it. Sure enough: the customer showed up in our e-mail inbox no less than 5 minutes later accusing us of being threatened on the phone.\nTeam leader listened to the call, chuckled at the incident and marked it as ‘Closed’ without even looking at its status any further.\n\nJustice. 😎",

        "text": "Here’s another tale from the same university call-center (see previous tale for background). This tale did not fare well for the student. It's not that information was released when it shouldn't have been, but more so that the inevitable happened. This all happened in the past but some of this is written in present tense as it’s easier to write that way.\n\nThis call came in on the Registrar line. For those who don’t know, the Registrar department handles all things registration; class scheduling, transcripts, ID cards, diplomas, etc. A student’s mom (yep, another mom) called saying her son’s (the student) final semester grades aren’t posted. She was very nice, not pushy, and genuinely wanted help. I could hear the son in the background. He sounded annoyed she was calling: he’s a junior knows how to check his grades... none of his grades are posted yet.... just have to wait for them to be posted... he’ll handle it himself, etc. A lot of “God, Mom”, “just chill”, etc. Mom asks me if this is normal, to not have grades yet. *Now, it was 3-4 weeks after the semester ended so it was not normal to be missing grades (it was a rare occurrence to be missing one grade let alone ALL grades)* I tell her it was not normal and while I cannot release registration information, I can look into the son’s file to see if an issue exists. I ask for the son’s info, she tells her son to give his information, son gives his info all while insisting the grades aren’t posted and they just have to wait. I tell him that at the very least I can see where the issue is. \n\nHis file is not marked confidential so I can dig a bit. I put her on a brief hold. I click through to the grades section and what do I see but all his grades listed! Not only that, but the time/date stamp show we’ve had them for a while. He isn’t missing anything! Then I see the grades... he earned a B, 2 Ds, and an F and was put on academic probation. *Going into senior year on academic probation was going to be difficult, he'd have to pull a rabbit out of his ass to recover in time for graduation. No wonder he doesn’t want to show his mom* To give him the benefit of the doubt of not being able to see his grades, I logged-in to the Registrar portal using my own information and it was working fine. I also made a quick call to the actual Registrar’s office to ask about any issues with the portal and confirmed it was working and there were no issues. I was then positive he was lying to his mom. \n\nI go back to mom/son and inform them that I show all grades are available and they should also be available in the online portal. Mom thanks me and asks exactly how to view them online. I give her the Registrar portal address and tell her it requires the student to log-in with his specific username and password. Wanting to get off this call before the inevitable unveiling happens, I start to recite my closing lines but she won’t end the phone call. She calls her son over and asks him put in his credentials (she is in front of a computer). *Oh dear God, she is going to make me stay on the call until she sees the grades* He’s telling her he already checked and he’ll check again later but she tells him to log-in anyways. She wants to see it for herself. \n\nHe logs-in but I hear him say he has an error message. She tells him to try again. He tries again and gets the same error message. *I’m sure he’s doing something wrong but I’m just quietly sitting there* She asks me about the error message and I say it’s a user-entry error and that I personally checked the portal and verified that it is working when I placed her on hold earlier. *At this point, I’ve wasted a lot of time trying to solve a problem that didn’t actually exist... all because he can't man-up. I'm sure he is logging in wrong on purpose* I then went on to ask whether he can access his university email. He can and he does. I then say that each student is assigned a network username and password; if you can access university email, there is no reason why he can’t access the Registrar portal because they all run on the same network and use the same username and password.\n\nMom relays this back to him this and they squabble for a bit with him yelling that he is doing it right. Mom then uses that mom voice we all know to mean she isn’t fucking around anymore. She tells him to again log-in. He logs-in one more time and it miraculously works! I say I’m glad it worked and try to again end the call but she still isn’t ready to hang-up yet. *Sweet Jesus, what have I done to deserve this* She wants to see it for herself and wants her son and I to be there with her.  \n\nSo I sit quietly while son navigates through to his impending doom. They get to the final screen... she starts reading the course title... then silence. I know she sees the grades but I’m not sure what is happening and I’d really like to get off the phone so I politely ask the status. She confirms she can now see the grades. I say “Great!” and ask if there is anything else I can do. There isn’t and she thanks me. I then tell her to have a great day and finally end the call. \n\nTL;DR: Mom wants to see sons grades. Son says they aren’t available. Mom calls university asking for help. Grades are available, son was lying because he is flunking out. Mom sees grades. ???\n",

You go find her and tell her she needs to get back to her desk, RIGHT. NOW!!!\n\nMe: I’m sorry, I can’t do that, but I’d be happy to have her call you back.\n\nCYL: This is ridiculous! Give me her email address!\n\nMe: I don’t have that information.\n\nOf course I do, but I’m not giving out this poor girl’s email to this crazy bitch.\n\nCYL: Then give me her extension!\n\nMe: We don’t have extensions-\n\nCYL: THEN GIVE ME HER CELL PHONE NUMBER\n\nMe: Ma’am, I do not have that information.\n\nThis time, I really don’t have that information.\n\nCYL: Then go get her and make her get back to her desk, NOW!!!\n\nMe: I can’t-\n\nCYL: NOWWWWWW!!!!\n\nMe: Ma’am, I. can’t. do. that.\n\nCYL: You are completely USELESS! *hangs up*\n\nSo many things about this conversation were so bizarre. The agent was not at her desk, and even if I knew where she was, who the fuck is this woman demanding that I ask her to come off her break and get back on the phone, especially to be screamed at by a crazy bitch? The request for her personal contact info was the icing on the shit cake that this call was.\n\nAnyway, I emailed the agent about it and she called the woman back - turns out she was pissed because the agent had told her she’d email her her documents and she “didn’t” receive them. Except she did. She checked a different email inbox than the one she’d asked them to be sent to.",

We didn't get that many calls per day, but the few that we did get were...interesting, to say the least. Being an animal shelter, we of course had the adoptable animals on the main floor and then the intake/newly picked up animals or animals that were still being treated or evaluated in the back. For obvious reasons, these guys aren't yet adoptable, but try telling stupid people what they can and can't do.\n\nOne day, we had an old woman call us up asking if we had cats available. \n\nI'm Drej. Crazy old lady will be COL.\n\nCOL: Hello, I was wondering if you had any cats available.\n\nMe: Oh, yes, ma'am - we've always got a good number of cats available for adoption!

You see, I've been wanting to save a life and I was specifically looking for one of those.\n\nME: ....Ma'am, our ferals and any of the cats that are scheduled to be put down typically have untreatable medical or behavioral conditions.

I'M SAVING A LIFE, YOU SHOULD ACCOMMODATE ME. I'M FUCKING 87 YEARS OLD AND I CAN'T DRIVE ALL THE WAY UP THERE AND I DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TAKE ME.\n\nMe: Then I'm afraid there isn't anything I can do, unfortunately. \n\nCOL (doing her best Holden Caulfield impression): YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF PHONIES SAYING YOU'RE SAVIN' A LIFE AND YOU JUST KILL OFF THOSE POOR KITTIES. **hangs up**\n\nI just sighed and went to tell my manager to watch out for any insane old ladies who might be coming to steal all of our ferals.

This was a common bug, there would be a blue screen and you couldn’t do much to fix it. Hard resets sometimes would fix it, but 9 times out of 10 you had to put in a work order for the driver to get it fixed and ask the driver to keep 8 days of paper logs/find a different form of navigation.\n\nThis is an inconvenience, but it’s better than the driver getting penalized for a non delivered load. Anyway, I stated all of this information to the driver and he blew up on me. \n\n**SD:** - stupid driver \n\n\n** Me: **  (standard greeting), how may I help you today?\n\n**SD: **  my GPS has a blue screen and I need it fixed immediately. \n\n**Me:**  that’s a fairly common issue as of late.

Unfortunately, I will need to put in a work order to have your GPS/cables worked on.

Besides, he’s not David Copperfield either, how can he possibly help me get to my destination? Is he going to put me on a magic carpet and wave a magic wand to get me there?\n\nAt this point it was difficult to hold the laughter and not cry at the same time. He went on this rant for another 10 minutes. Said something about how Hillary Clinton was behind this, white people are lazy (he sounded Asian) and other personal issues that had nothing to do with the issue at hand.\n\nEventually my lead came over. She heard this entire call and heard that he was yelling at me. She has the ability to yell at drivers/associates so she tore him a new one.\n\n**Lead:** Okay, listen asshole: we have to put in a work order for you. This is a standard procedure and if you don’t like it, then tough crap.\n\n**SD ** f%*!@&amp;$ fine!

Not a call center, but we had 4 students at once calling for a few hours a day. \n\nI was processing the application for one lady and everything was going smoothly.

After the first crash, I reset router and modem. Second crash, I call in. \n\n\nThe lady I talked to wasn't a gamer and didn't really know what I was talking about, but listened to everything patiently. Described everything to her and told her why we really needed the phones (waiting on call from hospital about surgery appointment.) She asked that I wait a minute and went to talk to her boss/supervisor, who was a bit of a gamer. They took a look and she came back stating that someone was attacking my connection (DDoS or something) and causing it to crash. She was then able to get a tech sent out today. \n\n\nI just wanted to share this since it is a positive and happy story and give a shout out to her for being so helpful and not just some guy complaining about losing internet and phone service for some reason.

He is a repeat international customer and naturally his orders often get delayed at the airport as they have go through customs first. His newest order has just been posted, and he just has one request for his order.\n\nSS: I really need this order as soon as possible. Can you send it through a different airport this time to avoid the delay?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but we have no control over which airport it is sent through as it depends how Royal Mail sort it when they receive it. The delays are caused by customs, and going to a different airport wouldn't change that.\n\nSS: I want to try a different airport anyway. Can you ask them to send it somewhere else this time?\n\nMe: *explains how our packages to the US are probably less than 1% of what Royal Mail has to send there every day, and that we really have no influence over which airport it goes to. Especially as the airport his previous orders have gone to are based in the same state as him*\n\nSS: Can't you call Royal Mail and ask them to find my parcel and make sure it is sent elsewhere this time? It is a tracked delivery - they can just find it by the tracking number.\n\nMe: Again, SS, our packages are just a very small percentage of what they receive and have to sort through. They will not delay hundreds of packages and waste so many man hours just to find one package and to send it to another airport.\n\nSS: Hmm. *he takes a few seconds to think, and I am hoping that the message has sunk in and he will just accept it.* Can you call British Airways?\n\nMe: Sorry? What do you mean?\n\nSS: British Airways. Your plane company. Can you call them?\n\nMe: Um.. why?\n\nSS: To ask them to redirect the plane to New York or somewhere.\n\nMe: No.\n\nSS: Why not?\n\nMe: Because they will have hundreds of people on the plane expecting to go to a particular airport. The airport they are flying to is expecting them and has space for them to land. If they were to suddenly redirect to another airport, they may not be able to land, the people on the plane will be very annoyed at landing in a different part of the country, and their customs team will suddenly have several thousand more packages to sort through which they will be unprepared for. This will cause even more delays for both you and the other people whose packages are on the plane.\n\nSS: Are you sure? My packages are usually delayed for about a week. The delay wouldn't be that long, surely?\n\nMe: I am absolutely certain. Furthermore I can not, and will not, make any attempt to inconvenience what will literally be hundreds of people to try to save you an unavoidable delay. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n(Thankfully the answer was no.)",

How may I help you?\n\nAC : we just receive our order, a table and some chair, and the delivery man leave everything in the box and told us to build it ourselves! That's unacceptable!\n\nME : can you gave me your order number? I will see what happens and find a solution. \n\nAt this point, I thought that they order delivery + built in service, which we provide if people need it. \nBy looking at the order I couldn't see any built order linked to the delivery. I did some research with name and address to find an \"unlinked\" order, still nothing. \n\nME : I can't find any built order at your name, maybe it was an other name? Was it order at the same address? \n\nAC : What is a built order? I don't want that! I saw the furniture in store, not some pack. I want the same at my place! I don't want to do it myself! \n\nME : Well, our store only sell the package but you have to built the furniture yourself. We have several sign all around the shop to remembered it and propose an built service. \n\nAC : we are not stupid, we are doctors! don't you think we would know if that was true??!! We want our furniture as they were in the store and we don't want to pay anything for it! \n\nAt this point, I just knew what happened. They obviously, didn't knew (who don't?!) that they will have to do it themselves and their pride were too high to admit their own error. The call continues for a will until I made them admit their mistake by telling them that their options were \"built the furniture by themselves, it's very easy, especially if you are a doctor\", \"order a built service\" and \"oh, you want to cancel the order? Obviously, when should we pick up everything?\". (I was a sarcasm master when working their with the client who deserve it).\n\nI don't remember what options they pick, but all the service laugh about it for a while. It's okay to don't know everything, but it was just in front of their eyes the all time (we sell the service, so, you can imagine how many sign there is...) and the brand is famous mostly because of that... But you know, they are doctor! ",

        "text": "I've had these stories for a long while but never found the right place to share them... until I found you r/talesfromcallcenters\n\nObligatory this happened a few years ago when I worked in a call center. \n\nBackground: My college university was so large they couldn’t handle answering their own phone calls so they opened a student run call-center (everyone that worked there was a student, including me). All major departments sent their calls to the call center. The actual departments didn't need to answer bullshit questions like whether an admission decision had been made, if your grades were posted yet, if your roommates were yet assigned, or what your financial aid package was, etc, etc, so we were given access to every student file in order to answer calls for them. We could tell you anything you wanted to know by pulling up your file. Of course, there were very clear limits on what information we could provide and what we could not. There are a few federal laws in place, too, that prevented release of certain information. However, every once in a while someone thought the rules/laws didn’t apply to them. \n\nThere was one student we all knew about. None of us had met him but his mother would call at least once a week looking for his information. She'd switch up which department she was calling each time, too. One time it was Financial Aid, the next was Registrar, etc etc... she didn't realize that all calls were routed to the call center so she thought she was crafty and getting a different person every time. Whoever was lucky enough to answer her call would briefly mute the phone and yell out ‘Guys, I got so-and-so's mom!’ \n\nEvery time she would start off being pleasant... says she’s calling on behalf of her son. She’d give his full name, SSN, and student ID number to pull up his file and... Lo’ and Behold... his file is tagged as CONFIDENTIAL. When a student file is tagged as confidential, it means that no information is given out. Nada. Nothing. Do not pass go. Full stop. When a file is tagged as confidential, the standard response is “I’m sorry, but I have no record of this student attending this university.” We couldn’t tell the caller the file was confidential because that meant we were admitting the student attended the university. So as soon as she gave us the student name, we'd knowingly pull up the student file only to give her the standard response. I'll be Me, the mom will be... Mom.\n\nMom: What do you mean you have no record? I KNOW he attends there. Try it again! His name is xxx his SSN is xxx his student ID is xxx.\n\nMe: (pretend type) I’m sorry, but I have no record of this student attending this university. \n\nMom: You’re doing something wrong. I KNOW he attends, I have a letter from the university! I need to change his address, can you tell me what address he has on file? Is it XXX? Everything needs to come to me! \n\nMe: I’m sorry, but I told you that I have no record of this student attending this university. \n\nSometimes I’d troll a bit and ask if she was sure she had the right information or even if she was calling the right university all while staring at his file. She'd often ask for his on campus address to send him whatever or his dorm phone number to call him to make sure he was alright (he hadn't called her in a while). Nope and nope. When she realized she wasn’t getting anywhere, she’d start screeching. Once that happened:\n\nMe: I’m sorry but I will not be spoken to in that manner. I must ask that you call back after you’ve had a chance to calm down so that we may have a productive conversation. Alternatively, if you believe there is an issue you can submit a request in writing or come into the office, the information is available on our website. Thank you for calling and have a great day. CLICK. \n\nThis was a weekly occurrence which almost always ended up in a hang-up. She eventually found out her son had made his student file confidential so when she’d call she’d start off saying she knew he made his file confidential but she was allowed to speak on his behalf. Nope, that’s not how it works. &lt;Insert standard response&gt; Receive rage from her. CLICK. Repeat next week.\n\nOne summer day I answered a call and it was the son! He gave me his information and because his file is confidential, I gave him the standard response of “I’m sorry, but I have no record of this student attending this university”. He tried to beg/plead for information, he tired providing information that only the student would know to prove its him, basically tried everything to get information. After a while he became quiet and said in a calm tone that he knew his mom had been calling for his information and he was calling to test the system to make sure nothing was given out. Of course I could not confirm/deny any of this but I just listened. He said that once she found out what university he was attending, she tried to get his admission withdrawn. When that didn't work, she tried to mess-up his financial aid. All in order to prevent him from attending the university. At some point he removed her from all his information, ceased contact, and blocked all his records.\n\nRemember when I said we answered calls for a bunch of different departments? Well when she demanded to be transferred to another department, we transferred her without hesitation... but to a department that we also answered calls for. As soon as I'd transfer her and hang up, we'd all wait to see who's phone she would ring at. *Hot potato hot potato!* That person would then answer, knowing I had just shut down to the hell-beast, and they'd repeat the entire conversation. There was NO way she was getting any information she wasn't supposed to have.",

        "text": "While I was a B2B coach at a cell carrier, one of my agents involved me in her call because the shipping address didn't match any addresses on an account that was ordering 10 additional lines with smartphones, and she had a bad vibe. She stalled the caller while I called the primary to confirm. Predictably, they said they had no need of new phones. I told the rep to advise her caller that shipping was set up and ended the call.\n\nI called our other B2B location in another state and spoke with their supervisors about the situation. They confirmed that yes, they'd had to provide credit for phones that weren't ordered, and had been happening for over a month. They always involved long-established accounts with immpecible payment history. For example, a drug store that had 3 lines for several years suddenly increased by ten new lines, and so, ten new smart phones were shipped to a real, but unassociated address.\n\nI brought it to our operations manager's attention and was told I could look into it, but not to piss of customers making a large order. Oh OK, we'll just piss them off with a bogus $5000 charge instead.\n\nMy team began searching the shipping addresses and found them to be either abandoned houses or empty houses up for sale. Shipping was either via UPS or FedEx with no signature required. It took all of a day to determine what was happening. The caller always verified, and calls were from all over our coverage area. So it had to be someone in our company selecting the victims and providing the security information. Again, there were no questions because of their payment history. Sometimes the ship-to was in another state from the acount, yet until that point none of the other reps questioned it. No one was on commision, so there was no financial motive to take the order, other than our legendary \"great customer service\". The scammers probably just picked up the packages off the porch when the driver left.\n\nMost frustrating was the company's initial reaction, which mirrored my ops manager. We can't be the police, if they verify, ship it. So for a couple months, the company shipped many tens of thousands of dollars in Blackberry and Android devices that they had no chance of getting paid for. \n\nAll credit to my team of wonderful ladies. We went rouge, much to their delight. We started calling the primary on anything that seemed out of the ordinary, and I allowed them to use their instincts. BTW, this violated the policy at the time. Finally we aggregated all the data and I got to present it on one of our otherwise time-wasting conference calls between centers. Alarmingly, the other supervisors all admitted dealing with such credits and bogus orders, but just rolled with it, because, reasons. Finally it was agreed that it would be a good practice to make a confirmation call on large orders.\n\nThis was only about seven or eight years ago, and even then they still had no way of tracking what agent logged into a specific account unless they left a note or other action, and all queues had access to those accounts. As far as I know, there was no internal investigation and they just ate the losses and moved on. There is too much stupid to list, but since all such credits were above our pay grade as supervisors, only an operations manger could approve them. You know them; they're the smart ones.",

Most people are normal, just want to get their stuff done and get off the phone, but occasionally you get someone who, I’m certain, just needs someone to yell at. This was one such person.\n\nTo preface this: The guy called in because he had prepaid for a room and told me the front desk wouldn’t allow his guest to check in.  AFTER I spent some time figuring out what happened and getting them to check the guest in, the following happened.\n\n**Me**=Me, **DB**=Douche Bag\n\n**Me**: Thank you for your patience, Mr. DB, I was able to get the problem fixed and your guest has been checked into their room now. Was there anything else I could do for you today?\n\n**DB**: Yes, you can tell me WHY they weren’t allowed to check in.\n\n**Me**: Well, while you did prepay for the room and tax, you did not notate on the authorization form that you wanted incidentals covered too. As security protocol dictates, we were not allowed to use the same CC for the incidentals, which means your guests had to provide their own for incidentals. This caused a hold up, but they are in now, and everybody is settled.\n\n**DB**: WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THEM PAY FOR THEIR OWN INCIDENTALS? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!\n\n**Me**: As I said, you did not state incidentals on your authorization form and we can only use the CC on file for what you authorize.\n\n**DB**: THIS MAKES NO SENSE!!  WHY DO YOU CARE IF MY CC INFO GETS USED WRONG?\n\n**Me**: [eye rolling], We care because we want our guests to have the best experience they can. Also this is our protocol.\n\n**DB**:  [this is where it gets interesting] WHERE ARE YOU EVEN FROM? YOU DONT SOUND BRITISH!!\n\n**Me**: I’m not British sir, I’m American.  \n\n**DB**: WHY THE FUCK AM I TALKING TO AN AMERICAN!!!???\n\n**Me**: Because our luxury properties like to keep their front desk staff available to help guests in house, so if you pressed one for reservations (he did), your call goes to one of our agents in America.  \n\n**DB**: I DON’T WANT TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN! I WANT TO TALK TO THE HOTEL DIRECTLY!\n\n**Me**:  Well we have already gotten your problem fixed, so we really are done here, but I can certainly get you to the hotel directly if you’d like...\n\n**DB**:  DON’T YOU DARE TRANSFER ME!!! I’M SO SICK OF BEING TRANSFERRED WHEN I NEED TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE!!!  \n\n**Me**: I’m uncertain how to help you then sir.  If you’d like to speak to them, I MUST transfer the call, as I’m not IN England.  But we have fixed the problem already, so I’m not sure we even need them.\n\n**DB**:  I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU ARE UNWILLING TO HELP ME!  JUST GET THE FRONT DESK ON THE PHONE FOR ME!  \n\n**Me**: Of course sir, please hold while I connect you.\n\n**DB**: DON’T YOU DARE TRANSFER ME!!!!!  I REFUSE TO BE TRANSFERRED!!  \n\nAt this point, I was really just at a loss as to what to do. He went on for another full minute or so on how rude it was to make him speak to an American when he wanted someone in England. And how dare we transfer him when he needs to speak to someone else.  \n\nI’m convinced he just needed someone to yell at, and I was that lucky someone!  ",

I work as a mentor rep for tech support. \n\n\n Essentially, we have our own steps of escalations when we have an outage or lots of offices/centers go down. One of these steps is to send off a Critical Incident Ticket (CIT) which goes to just about everyone up to the VP to advise that there's a massive outage. This time was different.\n\nOne day, we had one customer with no service. We were getting a new office going and this customer was going to be the first one on this office. Now, that office went down because it was new and not yet activated. I advise my Manager (M) about this.\n\n\nMe: Hey, M.\n\nM: Hi u/devdevo1919. What's up?\n\n\nMe: So, we have an office down but--\n\n\nM: Create a CIT!\n\n\nMe: But, it's one customer and the office has not been activated.\n\n\nM: It's still an office down! Create a CIT!\n\n\nMe: But, M. It's only **ONE** customer on this office.\n\n\nM: The process is to create a CIT. Please create one.\n\n\nI return to my desk and create the ticket and send it off. I feel ridiculous because I know a lot of people way above me are going to be emailing me and asking why I created a CIT for an office that wasn't even activated yet.\n\n\nSure enough, about 15 minutes later, I have about a dozen emails from at least a half dozen different managers asking:\n\n\n&gt;Why is this for one customer?\n\n\n&gt;What is this for?\n\n\n&gt;Why is only one customer affected?\n\n\nAnd so on. Each of these emails had my boss CC'ed to it so I get hauled into his office to explain myself. I was honest and then M got hauled in. My boss wanted me to forward each email asking why to M so he could reply and explain why a ticket designated for massive outages was made for ONE person. \n\n\nNeedless to say, M was scheduled for training on when and how to use the CIT tool and I had a few extra cups of coffee. Each manager that originally replied apologized to me and since then I have not been asked to create a CIT again unless it's a legitimate outage.",

        "text": "So let me tell you about this call. It will probably be the highlight of my career. This happened a few days ago or so. She will be `Mrs. Smith` and I will be `ME` and `F`will be Fucker and `SA` will be Super Agent. Everything has been changed of course. \n\n---\n\n&gt; **ME**: Hi Mrs. Smith, my name is Peace. My colleague has told me that you have made some payments but they have not gone through and you would like to get them updated. Is that correct? \n\n&gt; **Mrs. Smith**: Well, it's not that. It's just that I recently got scammed and I think that's why they've been stopped. \n\nI could tell that she was just sick of it all and just wanted her payments to go through. And if a customer is in this type of situ where they're speaking to us after being scammed, we are to be all empathetic etc, which I understand. I somehow tried to be extremely empathetic and helpful. Even if the last call was quite difficult. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Ah, I do apologise. Let's just do some verification. (Verification ensues). \n\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just going to read out some payments. Please let me know if you recognise them. \n\nSo I go through the transactions for the past couple of days, and customer recognised. They all went through to the retailers with no issue. Then I came to the final one. This one was stopped by us. \n\n&gt; **ME**: ...And this final payment to ABC made today on your card ending in 1234 for £500. Do you recognise that?\n\n&gt; **Mrs. Smith**: Yes. I recently got scammed and hacked so the the technicians from MicroComputer is on the computer fixing it. I had to ring them. ABC are MicroComputer.\n\nAt this point I sit up and think; wait, what? I know this scam. You readers probably know of it too. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry, did you ring them or did they ring you? \n\n&gt; **Mrs. Smith**: I rang them. I went on to Google and found their number.\n\nHer (I assume) second line began to ring and that's when alarm bells started to ring. I immediately knew that it was probably MicroComputer ringing her to find out why the payment hadn't gone through. She wasn't answering them. Yet. \n\nI decided to stall the fuckers. I was not going to let her be done over twice. She just had a similar thing happen. Went into full throttle. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Ah okay Mrs. Smith. Do you know what number their number is? Just so I can fill it in to authenticate the payment. \n\nThat was to stall everything to allow me to read into the company. Whilst she went through her call log, that gave me enough time to find their website which gave me their \"registered address\", their toll-free number and of course their name. Took a note of it all. \n\n&gt; **Mrs. Smith**: Yeah it's 0101-555-987. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry to inform you Mrs. Smith but those people do not work for MicroComputer. MicroComputer will never ask for remote access to your computer. Please turn off your computer and disconnect at the plug socket. Sorry to repeat but they are not from MicroComputer. Not only do I stake my job on it, I stake my life on it. \n\nNow here is where things take an interesting turn. Somehow the customer managed to do a conference call between herself, myself, and this technician from MicroComputer. \n\n&gt; **F**: Hello, why are you stopping Mrs. Smith's payment? \n\nEh? Had no idea who this person was. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry, I'm unable to discuss anything. Who is this?\n\n&gt; **F**: My name is Fucker from MicroComputer. We are trying to fix her computer. Why are you stopping the payment we're due?\n\nNope. You ain't due shit. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry I am unable to discuss anything with you. Mrs. Smith?\n\n&gt; **Mrs. Smith/F**: ....abjscvfk....forget iabdjhkj....*click*.\n\nSo as there wasn't a customer on the line and I knew Mrs. Smith's account/card was going to be compromised I block every product she had with us. She would not be able to use our online website, her card, account etc. I understand there might be some of you who think that may have been overboard, but this customer had already been scammed previously. I just think that the previous agent(s) have not told her that emails and calls from big corporations/companies are in fact duds. \n\nAs I could tell she was at her wits end, I just felt compelled to ensure that not only process be followed but that the customer's money and account was protected. I left a massive and detailed note explaining everything that happened and what the next agent **MUST** do. I was just in edit mode of the note to eliminate any ambiguity, when I received an email from an agent (SA) in the dept that is way more tech savvy than I hope to be. It came in less than a minute after I posted the note. Email convo went something like:\n\n&gt; **SA**: Hey Peace. Are you in System X? Please exit so I can work the customer's payments. Thanks for the note. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Oh hey, SA. Yeah you should be able to access it. Please read the note again as it explains a tad more. She is not speaking to MicroComputer. Thanks.\n\nAnd that was that. I took a note of the customer's details so I can read the journey of the investigation. Whilst we don't do follow-ups I really want to know the outcome of this and what happened. Any updates will be posted if/when they're available. \n\nI really hope she didn't hand over her money, because I can super block everything, but if the customer says they want the payment to go through we have to let the customer spend their money. \n\nI still feel like I forgot to do something on the call. Will probably be pulled for it when I return but hopefully it's nothing. \n\n---\n\nTL;DR: Customer conferences me and a scammer who then tries to get me to allow the payments to go through. Told him nah, and blocked the customer's accounts and left a note so when she calls through again, my colleagues know what conversation to have with the customer. \n\n---\n\nI'm not too tech savvy to call them and syskey them, but if any of you guys and girls are and want to waste these people's damn time, PM me. I'll be more than happy to share. \n\n\n\n\n",

We're a giant medical university with a hospital, a lot of outpatient clinics (of all kinds, you  name it) on the hospital's main campus and about six satellite locations in the state. We have so many patients that no clinic actually answers their own phone calls - they're way too busy seeing patients and they just can't. \n\nEnter the call center and me, at my desk taking the calls. \n\nFrom time to time we get a patient that INSISTS they won't speak to the call center, it's none of our business, and they MUST SPEAK TO SOMEONE DIRECTLY IN THEIR DOCTOR'S OFFICE!!!111oneeleventy\n\nHowever, tough titty. By policy, we have to put a message in and have someone from their office call them back when they can, in between patients or at the end of their day (unless it's a medical emergency, we have a triage list). \n\nAnywho, I answer this dick's call and ask him how I can help. He refuses to speak to me and tells me he's going to use the number he \"always calls\" and get through to them. I tell him that's not possible, but I'd be more glad to help him with whatever he needs....and he insists he's talked directly to the office before and he will again. \n\nOkay, I'll just go fuck myself; I only work here, what do I know? \n\nSince he's totally wrong, I waited until his number popped up in the queue again and then ninja-requested the call. I answered in my most cheery tone of voice and emphasized my name so there'd be no question he was getting me again. \n\nHe hung up and called again. I request-yanked his call and answered again, same cherry voice full of sparkle and sugar. \n\nWe did this routine (call, hang up; call, hang up) SIX MORE TIMES before he finally gave up. \n\nMade me laugh and laugh.

I work in a telecoms provider, selling sims and handset contracts etc, we’re the escalates complaints team, one step down from the regulators team.

        "text": "Hello everyone. LTL, FTP, LMNOP, NKOTBSB, ETC.\n\nFinally felt compelled to share an amusing story from the roughly four years I spent as a work\\-at\\-home customer\\-service agent in a \"virtual call center\" for a small, independent online retailer, which you may have heard of.\n\nWorking at home definitely had its perks. My commute was merely to walk across my bedroom. I had a semi\\-private restroom, a great kitchen for a break room, and on the slower days I could goof off and, so long as I was doing my work when there was work to do, nobody would know. Hell, I once binge\\-watched the first season of Daredevil \\(muted, with captions\\) over the course of two days, on the clock, and then played through Borderlands.\n\nI've wasted enough of your time, so onto my story. It was a typical day. Not too busy, but steady, but you know customers, and especially retail customers, are entitled AF and want you to *literally* do the impossible.\n\nNow, this particular retailer had an optional membership plan that they pushed on every one of their customers which gave said members a few \"perks,\" one of which was faster\\-than\\-standard shipping. What many, many customers failed to understand is that their membership does **not** mean that \\(a\\) we had to treat them any better than a non\\-member, or \\(b\\) that we could break the laws of space, time, and physics to please them. The discrepancy in cognition often led to interactions such as below. Please keep in mind that I'm recalling this all from memory of a few years ago, and that *I m*ay be embellishing the d*etails jus*t a bit for comedic purposes.\n\nThe Players:\n\nYours Truly: Your Friendly Neighborhood timdub.\n\nDick Waffle: Entitled and loud AF customer.\n\n===\n\nYT: Thank you for calling Amazing, this is timdub, may I have your name or email address, please?\n\nDW: Dick Waffle. dickwaffle@dick.waffle, and I want to know why the @#$&amp;#37; my order from two days ago hasn't shipped yet when I am an Amazing Prick Member.\n\nYT: \\(thinking, great another one of these\\) I'll be happy to look that up for you, sir. \\*click click clack click clack clack click....\\* Okay... is that the order for the Tea Party bumper stickers, the No Step On Snek flag \\(Made in China\\) and the MAGA personal massage device with Turbo Handling\\(TM\\)?\n\nDW: Yeah, where the @#$&amp;#37; is my package?!\n\nYT: Well, going by my internal notes and also the blurb on the website that says in big orange letters \"Out of stock until \\[1 day from now\\],\" I'd say that it hasn't shipped yet.\n\nDW: But, it was Prick eligible!\n\nYT: This is true. Which means that once it's shipped, it should take two business days to arrive at your door. If you'd like to get this a little bit faster it appears that I have the option to upgrade your shipping to one\\-day for $3.99...\n\nDW: No, this is @#$&amp;#37;@#$&amp;#37;. I'm a Prick Member so it should get to me two days after I order it. That's your GUARANTEE!\n\nYT: Sir, I apologize for any misunderstanding, but again, the guarantee is only the shipment time once the order is shipped. Once it ships, it should arrive by the promised delivery date of \\[three days from now\\], which was the date displayed for you on the screen before you placed the order.\n\nDW: More @#$&amp;#37;$#&amp;#37;@! You changed the date on me!\n\nYT: Mr. Waffle, if the delivery date changed post\\-order then we would have notified you by email and given you the opportunity to cancel. By our records you were not sent such an email, and this item has been out of stock for a week now with a notice on the site that says \"Out of stock.\" To be blunt, sir, we cannot ship an item that we currently do not have.\n\nDW: @#$&amp;#37; this! I've got a talk radio show in LA, *tiiiimduuuuub*, and tomorrow I'm telling the whole country about how *you person*ally f##$ed me over. F@#&amp;#37; this company, and !@#&amp;#37; you. I hope that you enjoy being put on blast!\n\nYT: Have a great day, sir. Thanks for calling Amazing, and being a Prick Member!\n\n===\n\nFun guy, huh?\n\nSo, curious as I was, I Google'd his name to see if he was telling the truth. Turns out that yes, Dick Waffle up there hosts a radio show in LA alongside his partner, to whom I will refer as Ass Nugget. I had never been put \"on blast\" before, so I made a mental note to listen to the broadcast tomorrow, ready to report this Dick Waffle for personal and professional slander, \\(I had very thin skin then\\) because while I may goof off a lot, I take my job seriously. How did he get that job if he couldn't read, anyway?\n\nSo, wrapping up my story, I fired up TunedIn the next day and tried to listen into the broadcast, which was Waffle and Nugget going on and on about shit that I didn't even really care about at the time. I'm waiting patiently for Dick to start his rant about my employer and I finally hear....\n\n**Nothing.**\n\nDick Waffle pussed\\-out.\n\nI was simultaneously relieved and disappointed.\n\nNever heard from ol' Dick again. Which is a good thing.\n\nThanks for reading.",

We are a 3rd party in this situation.\n\n\n\nMe: Hello, this is sh605, how can I help you today?\n\n\n\nB: FINALLY. I need a supervisor.\n\n\n\n\nLovely. In hindsight, I wish I'd transferred, but I'm a sucker for punishment.\n\n\n\n\nMe: I can certainly do that, ma'am, but they are not available at the moment so you'd have to leave a voicemail. I know you've been waiting a while, we're pretty busy today, so if you'd like I can try to help you.\n\n\n\n\nB: Fine. *silence*\n\n\n\nMe: Hello?\n\n\n\nThe call dropped. I have no idea what happened, but my trainee vouched for me that I didn't even touch the phone. It just ended. I was confused but there's nothing I can really do but take the next call, which I do for a while. About an hour later, she got through again, of course she got me again because these phones were designed by *satan.*\n\n\n\nB: I called a while ago and spoke to sh605, and she hung up on me!!\n\n\n\nMe: No ma'am, we were disconnected. I'm not sure what happened.\n\n\n\nB: *Sure.* LIKE I WAS SAYING, your company cancelled our account but there are still payments that we are owed from February.  I sent it but someone up there clearly can't read because it was refused.\n\n\n\nMe: No need for insults, please tell me the name and I'll find out what happened.\n\n\n\nShe gives me the name, I ask for a moment, mute her and look some things up while explaining what I'm doing to my trainee. Maybe a minute and a half, and I will concede that's a while to wait in silence over the phone but she started slapping her desk or the wall or something and yelling HELLLOOOO!!!\n\n\n\nMe: Yes, I'm here, sorry about that. I was looking at your account and it appears you didn't provide the customer's card number that we need to look them up in our system. We tried to look it up and bill without it but we don't seem to have anyone under this name.\n\n\n\nB: BULLSHIT!\n\n\n\nMe: Excuse me? \n\n\n\nB: I WROTE THE NUMBER ON IT!\n\n\n\nMe: It's hard to understand when you shout, but I heard you say you wrote a number. I see a 6 digit number here, if this is what you mean, ours are a bit longer then that and don't usually begin with these numbers.\n\n\n\nB: Well that's what he emailed to me last week. I told him it looked weird but he said you would take it... I should have figured he lied, your company is always lying to me.\n\n\n\nMe: (rolling my eyes) Did it say (my company name) on it? \n\n\n\nB: OF COURSE IT DID. I'm not an idiot. It also said (sister company).\n\n\n\nMe: Oh! We do accept those, they do look a bit different then what ours look like. Their numbers are usually 12 digits, did you see that on the back?\n\n\n\nB: He only sent me the front.\n\n\n\nMe: Can you email him back and have him give it to you or tell him to call us if he's worried it's not secure?\n\n\n\nB: Well he's long gone by now, clearly that's why I'm wasting my time with YOU.\n\n\n\nDid I forget how emails work?\n\n\n\nMe: I... I see. It couldn't hurt to try though, I'm sure he'll still get it.\n\n\n\nB: What is wrong with you? Just give me the fucking number!!\n\n\n\nMe: The foul language is unnecessary. I am trying to help but I can't if you curse at me. The number is tied to banking information, and even if it wasn't, (my company) didn't issue the card, (sister company) did, I don't have access to their records. \n\n\n\nB: I don't understand why this is all falling on ME when YOUR SYSTEM messed up. I entered it and your system kicked it out!\n\n\n\nMe: Oh? If that's true I should be able to find some record of it. Please hold.\n\n\n\nDig further, find the guy. They entered his name completely wrong, wrong invoice number, room number, literally all of the info they typed in did not match the receipt from their system. Well there's your problem!\n\n\n\nMe: Good news! I found him, and we actually paid for it already with payment number 0987654321, a few days after you billed it to us. \n\n\n\nB: So why didn't I find it when I searched for it in your system???\n\n\n\nMe: Well, the name is spelled differently, and the invoice number is a little off, but-\n\n\n\nB: Why??\n\n\n\nMe: You guys are the ones who entered it, so I'm not sure. If you just try the dates-\n\n\n\nB: It wasn't there before. Why is it there now??\n\n\n\nMe: Something you used to search must not have matched. \n\n\n\nB: WHAT DIDN'T MATCH???\n\n\n\nMe: I couldn't say. I can't see what you typed, but it is there and you can verify it if-\n\n\n\nB: THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!! WHY DON'T YOU KNOW?? IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER ME YOU FIND ME SOMEONE WHO CAN!!\n\n\n\nMe: I don't know because I can't see your screen or what you've typed. All I can do is explain how I found it. On X date we paid $XXX for him-\n\n\n\nB: What?? That's not what he agreed to pay!!! He told me he had permission to pay $XXXX from your company!\n\n\n\nMe: Did he say who gave him permission? I'm not seeing any notes on this. Besides that, we will only pay the rate you agreed to in your contract that you had at the time. IF we agreed to that, we would send a credit card authorized for the higher amount, and you wouldn't have used his company card. \n\n\n\nB: Well then why would he even say that?? He lied!!\n\n\n\nY'all. I have HAD IT with this woman.\n\n\n\nMe: I doubt he just walked in the door and offered to pay twice the normal rate. Sounds to me like you didn't want to accommodate him because you wanted more money, in breach of your contract with us at the time, and he said what he thought would make you happy so he could stay. \n\n\n\nB: .... \n\n\n\nMe: He shouldn't have lied, but you were violating your terms and conditions. You could have requested a block on those dates beforehand and if he really had permission he could have called us and we would have arranged it. None of that happened so you were paid your contracted amount.\n\n\n\nB: Well SOMEONE has to pay for his room!!\n\n\n\nMe: The keyword there being HIS. Not OURS. HE stayed with you, WE did not. Also, he did pay. We charged him and then paid you. If there was some other agreement between you and this guest, that's between your property and him. Feel free to contact him and ask him about that but you will not be paid any more for this stay by our company.\n\n\n\nB: If he doesn't respond to my email in 48 hours, you'll be hearing from me again!!! *hangs up*\n\n\n\nSigh. I don't doubt it.",

        "text": "Ok so a few years ago I was working for a major telcom company.  Where I dealt with billing and tech issues.   90percent of my calls were good folks genuinely helped and thankful for said help as we had a lot of leeway in helping.\n  I had one gentleman that had dropped his phone, busting the screen just outside of his warranty period and he was still in contract.  So couldn't afford to replace it and was really stressing about what I could do.   I offered to send him not one but two of the top of the line Android phones. Brand new, not reforbs, not used in anyway.  He had broke iPhones but was amazed I could do so and I was happy to help.   And offered to follow up and call him when they arrived to help get them set up.\n  So three days later I called him and he answered but was more upset than I expected and I asked what was wrong.  His exact words...These are white.  What the fuck am I supposed to do with a white phone.    I said sir you can get a case for it if it an issue.  He said no I want two phones in such and such color.   I said you got these free of charge , he said so their useless to him.   I disconnected.  \nI couldn't believe the change in attitude.  The entitlement.",

        "text": "I apologize in advance if this story or the formatting sucks, this is the first actual story I've posted on reddit... constructive feedback is encouraged\n\nThis lady called in screaming her head off about how she'd spent *SEVEN WHOLE HOURS* on the phone today. To be fair, she had a legit tech issue with the pre-owned phone she had recently purchased, it probably did need to be replaced, and she was within the return period, so I was trying my bag-of-apples darndest to stay friendly and polite, but a pattern started to emerge...\n\nme: ok maam well lets see what we need to do to get you another ph-  lady: did you read my notes!?!? This phones not holding a charge for more than 10 hours, and if it doesn't get replaced I'll lose customers and **MY DAUGHTER MIGHT DIE!!!**  me: well that sounds really serious! Lets see how we can get you another phone right aw-  Lady: I make $45 an hour!!! I missed 15 meetings today dealing with this, I think I'm entitled to a brand new phone for free!!!   me: ok maam, I understand you're frustrated with the situation, I would be too! I can certainly look into what we can do about the amount of time you've had to spend dealing with this, but it sounds like the first thing we really need to do is get you a working pho-\n\n(a 10 minute rant having nothing to do with her getting that darn phone)\n\nso, this pattern continued on for a full goddamned hour, of which 45 minutes was her ranting about totally unrelated bullshit, and it ended up with me repeating ad-nauseam \"I can sell you another used phone, or I can sell you a new phone, you'll get refunded when you send back your current phone, or tech support can just send you a replacement for free\", and apparently her $45/hr wheeler-dealer big shot job doesn't pay enough to just do a damned upgrade, because she finally relented to having tech send her a free replacement at the end of this call that I'm pretty sure took a few years off the end of my life...\n\nI suppose the real message of this story is: This is why Daddy gets drunk and yells at the television...\n\nI'm a bag of apples",
