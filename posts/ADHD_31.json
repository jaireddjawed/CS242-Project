        "text": "I was diagnosed with ADHD in November of last year after bringing it up with my psychiatrist, and started taking medication soon after. I don’t know how to explain it, but there’s always this deep fear that I’m faking this even though I feel like the medication is helping in most ways. I can get out of bed, I’m going to classes much more, I don’t feel as anxious and can do tasks that I want to do that normally I wouldn’t have done, and my anger issues have gotten somewhat better. But I feel like I still struggle to start things like homework and my actual job work (I WFH.) Does anyone else ever feel like they’re “faking” their ADHD in a sense? Like maybe I’m just depressed or lazy? I’ve explained this poorly but I guess I just wanted to express my frustration and I think about it a lot. Sometimes I think I really do have it and other times I don’t know if this is how I should feel on the medication, like is this what I’m supposed to feel like or no. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it.",

It's not the writing itself, but they're TYPING them in class, not handwriting; except for the outline or a research worksheet. \n\nAs with many of us, her brain thinks faster than her hands. She does not have proficient typing skills to keep her thoughts together and type at the same time. I know I can't do this, so I can't expect her to magically be able to.  \n\nMy solution is to allow her to use the text-to-speech software I use to just get it all written out. Print, edit, revise, repeat. HOURS of mental torture saved. I'm all for it. I see no reason in withholding a tool that would relieve so much mental pressure from her. \n\nBUT she's only in 4th grade and I don't want to unintentionally set her up for future failure. I absolutely disagree with elementary kids having to type their work already, as they can barely write by hand, but if typing is already the norm, I see no reason she can't use tools I use to help with that. And to be clear, she NO idea what ChatGPT is lol.",

As a pre-text; I've been pretty depressed and apathetic for the past 2 months to the point I'm not really enjoying my normal leisures and I do absolutely 0 work. But today was an interesting day.\n\n01.00 - go to bed with the goal to wake up at 7.00 to go to the office to work on an assigment that has a deadline for tomorrow that I've been putting off for 3 weeks\n07.00 - shut the alarm off and decide I can do a WFH day, get more sleep and work on the assigment later.\n11.00 - finally feel guilty enough to get up, notice I have a missed phone call from a job application I was pursuing. Voice mail asked if I could call them back\n11.30 - after a shower I call back expecting bad news, which it was. My application was rejected. I decide I'm now not in the mood to work on my assignment and I'll start it later in the afternoon.\n15.00 - decide I still don't want to do the assignment and I can work on it in the evening.\n15.30 - apply for a different job opening so that I can at least tell myself I did something productive today. In the application I have to do a personality test and a logical thinking test in which I score surprisingly high, so that got my spirits up a bit.\n16.45 - get ready to leave for my appointment with my therapist at 17.00 (the pratice is right around the corner)\n16.50 - get stuck in the building elevator. Call the emergency number but they have no engineers in the neighbourhood that can help out on short notice, so they recommend I call the fire department. Call the fire department and wait. Also call my therapist to cancel the appointment as I'm literally stuck in the elavator\n17.30 - fire department comes and opens the elavator within a minute of arriving, good laughs were had. Decide to go for a walk and do grocery shopping\n18.30 - come home to a missed phone call from an unknown number. It was the job I applied for today. They liked my resume and my testing results. They're sending me coding challenge and ask if I can do it this evening as they're closing applications soon.\n19.30 - after having eaten dinner I dive into the coding challenge. It's pretty easy, but I'm quite rusty so I do some back and forth but figure it out in the end. Another big confidence booster for the day.\n21.00 - I'm in a good mood so I guess I can now work on my work assignment that is due tomorrow. Put in some effort; it's not great but it'll have to do - I'm fine with it.\n\nA day that started with my usual apathy, a big rejection and then a worse case lift scenario...actually turned out to be pretty good. Eventhough not everything went great, I got instant feedback on my actions which kept me motivated and made me able to do things I've not been able to do for a long time. It really highlighted to me once again that, no people with ADHD are not lazy, they just need the right motivation and interest.",

        "text": "I am a man with ADHD, I was diagnosed at 8 years old. Although this seems young to be diagnosed at I am definitely not unsure of the fact that I have ADHD.\n\nEver since I can remember my lack of impulse control has been the only reason why I end up in situations that can only be described as, “Sticky”. Both of my parents had/have ADHD so I was destined for failure, or for greatness? I will not use ADHD as an excuse for any addictions I have but I know it contributed to the fact. \n\nRecently I made a comment when I was threatening to leave the house that I live in with my parents after being locked out. I said verbatim; “I will be gone, dead or alive you will not see me again”. Which prompted my mother to call the police, I was taken to a psych ward because she told them I was threatening to, you get the point. I was placed on watch and for no reason. I am no longer prone to those thoughts and I learned to control them.\n\nWhat I have not learned to control is everything else that comes with ADHD, I can control my focus for the most part, but my impulse control is extremely low. My own mother said “Without your medication you will end up in jail”. I have thought on that and come to realize maybe she is right. I need to get my life on track and figure out how to control this before I ruin every other aspect of my life. I’ve already ruined social interaction, any school will not take me, my family resents me, but I will not let that burden me too much. I want to learn, but I don’t know where to start.\n\nMaybe someone on here can recommend me a study, a book or any advice at all in order to control myself. It is not as easy as “don’t do it” when my brain is set on something out of impulse I feel complied to fulfill the task given to me. Please help me, therapy and psychiatrist appointments only go so far, I need help from people who know the most. One of me.\n\nI’m glad to answer any questions given to me and I will elaborate if needed by editing the post. Have a great day reddit.",

I like to spend time alone, just sitting on a bench for hours me lost in my mind enjoying the soft breeze. I like to just go for a walk and feel like in a movie. In the past I had a very strong addiction to cigarettes (i overcame it) and now in different parts of life I tent to do things impulisively, I also do things either on 100% or 0%. I hate the way school system is set up and I strugle in school. \n\nEven though I’m very good at many things some things that are very easy for others just feels very difficult for me for example, I don’t have a driving licence yet but I can imagine having trouble driving. I feel like I had to make a stop after every wrong turn to get my thoughts in order and only then continue. Also if there is a task for 100 people 99 people would get it right and I would be the one who did it wrong. For example. If I buy a train ticket, I’m certain I bought the wrong one up until it gets checked by the train staff. What else hmmm\n\nI love when thungs are done different than the ordinary way hence my chaotic music library.\n\nI want to play polo, smoke cigars, talk about watches and tea and art even though I’m broke. If I told people they would call me cringe but I just don’t understand why others aren’t interested in said things.\n\nAnyways I’m having a hard time actually finishing this post and not deleting it an moving to something else.",

My brain just....does not register objects sometimes.  I'm more prone to injury, I forget I'm on the stairs, and tumble down.

The best way I've described this feeling to others is the horrors the characters experience in \"Doctor Who\" with the monster The Silence.  People immediately forget about the silence when not looking at then.  So they leave messages to themselves in the form of tally marks written on their skin.  Suddenly they are covered in tally marks after walking in a room. \n\nNo wonder my father developed these outburst and anger issues.

It's supposed to release dopamine from what I understand, and I've been told and learned in school that it's even supposed to help people be more focused, at least for the average person. But I've also seen many comments here about it not being so rewarding for ADHD people. Is it anecdotal or is it related?",

I paid about $140/month on my parents private insurance, so this sounds too good to be true. I didn't have much trouble with a prior auth before, but I'd like to hear if anyone has experience getting Medicaid in NY to cover Vyvanse.

Two weeks ago I tried to get my medication and it's literally nowhere, chased it for a week, ran around my insurance, etc. So after a week and a half, I get a notice from my doctor's office they sent a script for Strattera instead. I didn't do any research at the time and assumed it was more or less an analogue of Adderall like Ritalin to more or less substitute for the Adderall until it comes back or I switch to a like-perscription\n\nBut now that my insurance finally approved it I look into it and it's not that at all. It's a totally different thing that acts totally differently with different side effects and all. My doctor never consulted with me or let me know anything, he just sent the script to the pharmacy and their office told me to pick it up and take it and let them know if there any bad side effects or whatever.\n\nThe thing is though I kind of don't want to. My medication was working fine, I had slightly higher blood pressure he said we had to watch and make sure it didn't get higher, but it wasn't bad enough for him to make me stop taking it the last 2 months. The side effects for this other stuff don't seem worth it, I can't deal with MORE fatigue as I'm already fatigued without my meds.\n\nI'm upset because he changed the entire course of my treatment without as much as letting me know what was going on, or even what I should expect to feel or how long I should expect it to take to work, I had to GOOGLE this myself. And I actually cried, after 2 weeks of hell thinking I'd finally get relief today, I find out this medication isn't like what I was already taking, and takes MONTHS to take effect. O dont think i can wait 2 months, the last 2 have been BRUTAL. I'm pretty upset tbh, just wondering if I'm justified before I call them tomorrow to see why this happened to me...",

Am I lazy? Am I just dumb? Am I not capable? Are other people genuinely just better than me?\n\nTo be honest I started to hate myself, I went through several years of CBT, and fought back with everything I had. I would never give up, I would always fight, but it would always end in depression, my own definition of failure, and burn out. \n\nHow could I be a valuable member to society and those around me when I can't be a valuable member to myself even when I'm fighting EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. but end up defeated. \n\nThis went on for 20 years...\n\nIt wasn't until last year that I moved in with my lovely significant other who started making silly jokes about my ADHD. At first I thought she was purely kidding but one day her tone and demeanor made me think she was serious. I followed up on this instinct and asked: she was serious the whole time.\n\nA few days of research felt like I was reading my own autobiography as I read about ADHD. This led me to ask my Dr how I could go about being diagnosed and as of a few days ago. I am diagnosed.\n\nMy specialist said I'm on the severe end of ADHD and I've begun 15Mgs of slow release Adderall today. I feel like a feather! Tons and tons of weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I feel like I can DO THINGS. Small tasks aren't the size of mountains, interacting with my parents doesn't feel like a job, and best of all I'm not BEATING MYSELF UP! \n\n30 years of not knowing what was wrong. 30 years of being ignorant to what the symptoms of ADHD really were. 30 years of training myself to be the best me I can be even under a ton of weight and it's gone! \n\nI feel like Rock Lee from Naruto with my leg weights off: [https://youtu.be/rWKda4d9pKw?t=27](https://youtu.be/rWKda4d9pKw?t=27) (Should start at 27 seconds.)\n\nI just wanted to share, I'm in such a good mood, thanks for reading,\n\nBrandon\n\nTL;DR: I'm diagnosed, I'm on 15mg slow release Adderall, I feel AMAZING.

I’ve always had a bad relationship with food and it doesn’t really help that I’ve always been overweight throughout my life. I’m also of the current opinion that if I didn’t need food to survive, I wouldn’t eat cause it’s too much of a hassle. But I’d still end up getting “too much” food. \n\nThe place I’m living in right now doesn’t have a kitchen (dorm with no commune area), dining hall food kind of suck, and the hours are TERRIBLE. I’ve mostly resorted to buying food from campus restaurants, campus convenience stores, and DoorDash. \n\nMy problem is I am very impulsive when it comes to food-buying. Like I may be a bit hungry, try to talk myself out of buying something, but then I’d still end up buying the food. And the vast majority of the time, I immediately regret buying it as I’m no longer hungry or I just am no longer Vibing for the food I bought. Obviously I can’t do any returns on food or anything, so I’ve no choice to eat it. \n\nOf course, I can save the rest of the food in my mini fridge, but sometimes I just forget  about what’s in there and end up buying more. And then the next day I just don’t feel like eating that food anymore so it goes to waste. \n\nI’m kind of tired of wasting food, my bank account being low, and feeling like food’s a must buy whenever I get hungry. Like I can snack, but I don’t want to cause I know it’s not healthy and also cause I just inhale the whole thing the day I buy it. Used to buy apples and put them in the fridge but then I’d forget or not want to eat them. Same thing for overnight oats, but all the ingredients for it, made only one batch and ate 4.5/6 of them and the rest is in my fridge. Haven’t touched them since and it’s been a month.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

I bought two shares (my first investment ever) just because that is really all I have the power to do in my situation, though minuscule. \n\nFirst, I’m curious if people a large portion of people with ADHD bought a few shares of TEVA if it would possibly change the manufacturing issues as the portion of the company will be owned by people with ADHD? \nSecond, would this be something people who have been impacted by these shortages be willing to throw $20 at?",

I feel like they both start at the most inconvenient time—it’s so late and by the time i get home i’m too tired to do anything. My dad can’t take me to either class any earlier either.   \n\n\nmy parents signed me up for karate 4 years ago, and i haven’t taken a break outside of covid until now. I took a break starting in January or the beginning of February. They’re now denying they forced me to take it when I would have literally never asked to do that. I get so stressed out every time  I have to go. You’re basically doing an exhausting workout for an hour and a half, to give you the idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really love karate and am quite good at it, but my mental health has NEVER been in the place to commit to that type of thing. I’m severely depressed, have adhd as implied, and the last few months have been terrible because my abusive mom milked her injury to stay home from work longer. She only went back to work this week but is off today after two days. \n\nI’m burnt out and would rather try again when i’m medicated. There’s also a huge stigma about quitting karate and taking breaks in karate. My mom doesn’t believe I have adhd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also do art class now, and I actually love doing art. I draw every day and paint landscapes sometimes.\n\nIt’s a new, smaller place and since the owner made me start this self portrait I just really haven’t been feeling it. And again it ends so late. Karate ends at like 7:40-something, but is farther away. Art class actually ends t 8, but my parents usually have me get there at 6:20 since you are supposed to arrive between 6 and 6:30. I didn’t bring it last time because I thought I could just finish it at home, but she got upset and wants me to finish it there.\n\nI can’t ever commit to extracurriculars. No matter how much I like the idea they end up stressing me out sooner rather than later. I also hate that they put a wrench in my schedule. If I have to be somewhere at at 6:30 that means my five o‘clock block is pretty much taken up. \n\nI have to leave in 20 min or so. I said i’ve been working on my potrait but I really haven’t. It’s been two weeks and I‘ve either forgotten about it or just don’t ever feel like working on it.   \n\n\nWhat do I do about all this? I don’t really have the option to quit, nor can I go on medication or get treatment. Please do not comment on my abusive home situation. That’s not what this post is about and telling someone they should “just talk to a guidance counselor” or “call cps” is really just bad, ignorant advice.",

For years I've been feeling like descriptions of ADHD were exactly spot on me, but I figured oh well autism and ADHD do have some overlap so that must be it. I never thought my stupid fanfiction would make me doubt that.\n\nIn my fic, one of the characters needs to learn a large amount of information in about a week. They have all the study materials they need, and if they fail someone is going to die, but the info is boring so they just can't do it. They try and they try and they try, but they can't focus on what they most need to learn. \n\nI assumed this was a normal thing everyone went through, all the time. That's why school is so hard, right? Because studying boring stuff is basically impossible? Only for all my commenters to talk about how the character must have ADHD.\n\nMe thinking about how hard I relate to basically everything about ADHD like. Uhoh. I tried coffee for the first time recently only to find out that caffeine knocks me out HARD. No \"upper\" effect from it, just puts me to sleep. That's uh. Not normal.\n\nNow I'm wondering if it would be worth it to get tested. I just think it's sort of funny- One little plot point in my silly fanfiction that I thought was a completely normal thing has turned a lot of my life upside down. And now I'm wondering if there's more than just autism to my constant thinking and thinking and thinking, massive executive dysfunction (help, my apartment is a mess), inability to sit still, struggle to keep track of time, hyperfixations, and etc etc...",

Sometime after I got a prescription to an off brand Adderall and since then I have excelled. Within a a year of having my job I was made sous chef, though I would say that is all chalked up to skill and the organization that Adderall helps me to accomplish. Then we parted ways with our pastry chef and I got laterally moved to that position!! \nThis is all leading up to my thought: \nIs anyone else an adhd having manager or boss? I mostly just check on orders and talk to random folk, or handle problems with my very small morning crew, but I have a huge to do list and I notice I get put off track HARD.\nAnd sometimes I have to tell myself\nI need to go outside and take a break or else I can’t do anything else. It’s all very distracting and without my small break I just stall, but then a lot of the times I find myself at the end of my work day unfed and worried about the condition of my work for service. \n\nAny other pastry chefs out there with adhd who have a good plan? I make three lists per day and have a watch that chimes on the hour to keep me on check.",

I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to add Brintellix later, with breakfast, about 2-3 hours after Concerta.\n\n On websites about interactions between drugs, I found information that methylpheniate and vortioxetine can interact with each other, but both were prescribed to me by the same doctor, so I assume that he assessed it as a safe combination (?) 😉 If you have any other experiences, please let me know.\n\n If it's relevant, I also takr Pregabalin at night, but as far as I know the dose is low (75mg).",

I’m not 29 and honestly haven’t processed that I could have an auditory processing issue until recently. I just notice I ask others to repeat a lot, especially voice mail messages sometimes 3-4 times. People over the phone in general? Even worse than in person. The fuzziness over the phone makes it hard to understand what they are saying. I’ve also always been a musician so I never thought I had this but then I realized lyrics are tough for me. Like I’ll go years to learn I’ve been singing the wrong lyrics. I’m great with melodies, harmonies, and various sounds. I can guess an instrument quick. But repeat back a line I’ve been listening to for years? Good luck.\n\nAm I dealing with some auditory sensory issues as a result of ADHD?",

        "text": "Is something wrong with me?Just stress or ADHD? reddit help\n\n \n\nHi, I just don't know anymore if I'm making something up or if there is something more to it. I find it extremely hard to put into words, so that might be a bit too long (sorry:))).\n\nI've always been rather quiet and anxious with other people, especially when it came to people in school or university. I've heard many times that I am quiet and calm. I listen a lot but don't talk enough, which is obviously not very helpful. It rather made me even quieter. I'm 24 now. I was very good in school until I finished high school. All I actually cared about were math, English (as a foreign language), and physics. I had good grades in high school, but before high school, I had really good grades and took part in a physics and biology contests. Generally, I felt the teachers were more encouraging (especially my physics teacher). I often blamed myself for choosing the high school I went to because it seemed like no one cared as much, and generally speaking, it was fairly easy to get good grades without trying hard. I think now, though, that I could have done more, and it is nobody else's fault that I also sort of stopped caring. \n\nThe summer after high school and before university, I spent just thinking about how I wasted those years, how I could have gone somewhere else, learned more, etc. (side info: I could choose any high school without a recruitment process since I won a biology contest, but I went to the closest one to my home). And I wasn't sure about what I chose to study.\n\n I also had very high expectations that studying and living in a dorm will be great. But it wasn't. Because I'm so shy and kind of socially awkward, I didn't make any friends at my uni. My roommates weren't perfect, and what is the worst, I just couldn't study. I failed a few subjects. I had tears in my eyes when I didn't pass one mini-test in physics. I failed math. But I feel like I didn't try my best. I felt like I didn't really listen and didn't really understand what was going on. I cried. I felt just bad there. Next year, I went to a different city to study something else. I just wanted to get through the first semester. I wanted to pass math. And I did. And really well actually. But I felt like it's nothing because it was way easier than in the other university (it was basically the same material). \n\n\nEvery assignment I would put off to the very last moment. I was getting very nervous when we had practice classes(I was studying electronics and any practice stuff were new to me). I couldn't focus, couldn't come up with the solutions, I felt like an idiot a lot. And I hated it. Also, I wasn't used to getting any help because I always studied by myself, and I was fine. I always had big plans of learning everything about the topic. I would open many articles, look for books, YT videos, etc., and at the end, I barely did anything. But I was getting through each year. I even started writing my thesis, but I didn't do compulsory internship and didn't finish one course. And I just stopped writing. I decided I'm not finishing. I thought to myself, I know absolutely nothing. That it would be just pathetic to be an engineer with that sort of knowledge.\n\n\n Since then, I started thinking about therapy, and I went last week for the first time, actually. Ok, all that is above is not my actual problem; it is just the background. It has been a year. I've made plans for myself, what I can do, what I can learn. I always think it's a great idea because I seem to have so many, but I always fall short when trying to make them a reality. Sometimes, it's like I get nervous just sitting in front of my computer when I'm about to do something. I wanted to learn 3D graphics, so I watched one tutorial, but then I stopped for a few months. Then I started again, did a little bit every day, and then stopped. I thought I'm gonna watch CS50 now. I thought I should learn this, this, this, I have ideas of what I could do with 3D animation, and then I opened the program, and it's like my mind is just empty. I get nervous and frustrated. The only thing I could do pretty frequently was studying Spanish, at least for some time, but I had a few-day break, and since then, it's been like two weeks, and I can't get back on track.\n\nSometimes I'm making lists for myself of what I should do. I think to myself, don't put anything that you can't do in a day. I made a list for one day three days ago. What I did from that list is eating breakfast and doing one workout. The actually important stuff is still waiting. What I also do a lot is imagining myself being great at what I am trying to learn. I'm imagining a whole different life based on that skill. I'm talking to myself like I'm answering someone's question about how did that happen, how did you learn, etc. It's so stupid, but I just seem to love it lol. Like it makes me feel better, like I actually did something. I would also sometimes just stop what I'm doing and start having these imaginary conversations with myself.\n\nI find it hard to clean my room and keep stuff not everywhere. I have trash in my closet because I don't use it, and I don't see it, so it doesn't bother me. I rarely do laundry, and I can go without a shower for a few days, but it's also because I don't have any job now. When I had a job, I used to shower more. The thing is, I don't know if I'm stupid or not. I mean, I don't think I'm dumb or anything, but maybe I just always had that idea that I'm good at math and physics, and actually, I was just good at some basic stuff, and I'm not smart enough for more advanced stuff. Or is it just because of the stress that I get when I'm about to do some task, like write some code or come up with some idea for graphic design.\n\nAs I mentioned, I started watching CS50, which is an Introduction to Science course, and you get some exercises to do with it. They are relatively simple, but I struggle. It's like I know exactly what to do, but I can't get the actual answer in my head, and I get nervous. Its like solution is wriiten on a paper but someones is waving their hand before my eyes so I see just bits of it and I cant put it together. I also used to like to draw when I was younger. Now I put a blank paper in front of myself, I get a pencil, and it's like I'm stressing out. It's so stupid, and I know it. Why I can't do anything about it is beyond me. I also can't concentrate. I try to read really fast so I won't get distracted. I have a smiley face on my Google Chrome on my phone (which means over 100 tabs open). I have three windows and a lot of tabs with YouTube videos to watch.I have some papers on my desk with words to translate\n\n\nI know I could just do it one day and move on, but it is never just that. It seems like a problem with a simple solution: just do a little bit of something. What the hell am I doing? I'm just tired with myself. xd One last weird thing I keep doing is like stroking my hand with paper corners when I'm doing something on my laptop or when I'm reading a book. I just want to do that so much; I don't know why. XD I read somewhere that if you are doing something you think is weird, probably someone else has already done that. So I can't be the only one with that stupid thinking. Is this something to go to a psychiatrist with, or do I need to deal with stress first? I want to study again, I wanna be excited to learn again not stressed out. Thanks for reading. :)",

I forgot how alcohol affected me and fell for it again. Turns out i have trauma because my mother used to drink when I was young and then i fell for the same thing. Now I'm done with alcohol trying to quit the plant and also tried quitting cigarettes. Sadly they seem to be the thing I'm addicted to most even when I managed to cut down.

        "text": "Hey!\n\nSo a couple months ago I started on Elvanse 30mg and it was working really well for me but didn’t feel like enough. My doctor upped the dose just over a month ago to 50mg and I didn’t feel much difference from the 30mg. But, on Friday I started feeling weird, I was having chest/heart pain and heart palpitations, like stabbing pain, I was feeling very breathless and was dizzy. It was on and off throughout the day and then it got worse and my hands were going tingly and I was getting pain in my shoulder and left arm. \n\nThis carried on through Saturday so I decided to go to A&amp;E. they did bloods and an ECG, told me everything was normal with my heart and I was experiencing anxiety. I mentioned the medication I was on and concerns about the side effects and the doctor told me that if anything was going to happen in terms of heart problems caused by the medication, it would’ve happened as soon as I started taking it, not a few months down the line. So they’ve basically told me I’ve been having panic attacks since Friday that have continued into today. But it just doesn’t sit right with me, I’ve experienced anxiety before, but never to this extent. I woke up the other night in a panic, couldn’t breathe, my left arm was tingly and hurt, my heart was pounding and I felt like I was going to throw up. Anxiety does run in my family but this feels so much more serious. And it’s so frustrating because the symptoms of panic attacks and heart attacks are so similar. So now I’m anxious that there’s something wrong, when there might not be so it’s just exacerbating my anxiety and making things worse..!? Has anyone experienced this? Could it just be anxiety? If so, how do I stop myself from freaking out over these symptoms, heightening my anxiety even further??",

        "text": "My spouse is diagnosed with ADHD, and I am working on getting a potential diagnosis. We have been living together for 5+ years and it took me YEARS to figure out this trick. Now, this is still a work in progress, but I'll break it up best I can. My spouse leans more \"inattentive\" (in my opinion).  We are residing with my Father in Law currently, and no ADHD (assumed) for him, he has very similar brain/habits. \n\nIf my spouse can't see the food, it doesn't exist.  \nFor example:   \nLeftovers in a solid container? Doesn't register with his brain.  \nCans of food shoved into the back of the pantry? \"Oh, I didn't know we had that already\".\n\nHowever, things that are always in the fridge (his hot sauce, coffee creamer) he has 0 issues with.\n\nMy solution/what I have done so far with positive results:\n\n* **Clear containers for leftovers** \\- or better yet, Ziplocs. If it is in a solid container, his brain doesn't seem to register that it is there. Its like a void in the fridge.\n* **Turning labels toward you**, or if the labels are too busy (I find pasta sauce labels too busy) I turn them so you can clearly see into the jar. Organizing the fridge so you can see whats in there with one glance\n* Put things that are always in the fridge and you trust they are in there (coffee creamer, milk, not often used condiments, soda, beer) all the way to the back or on the door. **PUT PERISHABLES IN FRONT.** Even for me, if the peppers are shoved all the way in the back, we forget about it and they go bad.\n* **Pantry** \\- Different shelves for different items. Put snacks on one shelf, canned food on another, and again, **PUT PERISHABLES IN FRONT** (open cookies, open nuts)\n* **Beverages**: if cost/space allows - a separate fridge for beer, soda, etc. This has not only helped with freeing up room in the main fridge but allows us to see all beverages in one organized space. Plus, you can fill it up all at once instead of trying to remember to refill the few you have in the main fridge as you drink them.\n* **Use those Fruit/veggie drawers and put all sandwich (or whatever) fixings in there**. So when you go to the fridge and like \"I want to make a sandwich\" you can open the drawer and unload everything you need in one handy location. This way you won't forget the salami shoved into the back of the fridge, or that cheese you bought 3 months ago. **Put opened items in the top, unopened items in the back/bottom**. This prevents you from opening 2 kinds of the same lunch meat.\n* **FRUITS** \\- This was one of my biggest pet peeves. **TAKE THE FRUIT OUT OF THE BAG**. My spouse was blind to the apples but always wanted apples when we went shopping. It was SO frustrating.  I realized that if I took them out of the bag, put them in a bowl or plate on the dining room table or in an open space on the counter, he would actually eat them. Also works with oranges.\n* Also on fruits, he LOVES mangos. So, I kept buying him mangos, then he would forget about them because its always \"I'll get to it later\". So, I've started drying out the mangos with the **dehumidifier**. Its some prep work that I have to do, but if it means he will eat his fruits... plus the mangos won't go bad nearly as fast when they are dried. \n\nPlans for the future that I feel would work for me (and likely my spouse with habit-building):\n\n* When you open something or make something: **Masking tape + sharpie** (not pen, pen won't stand out) = write down when it was opened or when it expires - whichever is easier for you. I've got an Alexa in my kitchen so I can easily yell out to her \"When does opened pasta sauce expire?\"\n* **Clear containers** \\- for dried fruits, cookies, pasta, etc. I feel like if the items (not just the boxes) are visible, they will register with his brain better. Plus, it looks pretty :)\n\nThis ended up being longer than I intended, but I thought that by explaining my reasoning or why it worked, might be helpful.\n\nHappy to expand or answer questions where I can!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Extra info about me that you could likely skip***: I use the word \"spouse\" because 1. we are basically husband and wife just without the paper 2. helps normalize the word for LGBT+ people. \n\nThe items bolded are just to highlight the important items and make it (hopefully) easier to read for our special brains haha. I'm extremely happy I've discovered this sub. I've been active on Reddit for over a year and I can't believe I didn't even think to check for an ADHD sub! \\[face palm\\]\n\nSlight derailment: I feel like I've probably had ADHD my whole life but never got diagnosed because of reasons... however I have an official evaluation scheduled for 2 weeks from now. I've had to learn to live with it, so I mask by organizing and making a TON of lists. ***If y'all find this helpful, let me know and I'll be happy to share more as I think of them! :)***",

This definitely helps me be more time- efficient, since when I get stuck or don't understand a concept I can just ask for a quick explanation, instead of spending 20 minutes searching through the textbook and lecture slides and random youtube videos trying to understand it.\n- Getting a bag of candy and giving myself a chocolate after I finish each homework problem or figure out each topic. Helps motivate me slightly, and the calories are fine because i'm slightly underweight, I just forget to keep buying candy.",

If anything would go wrong, or if he had to wait for me for too long, he would become so angry at me, to the point of becoming almost violent sometimes. Even my low pitched voice would drive him nuts. When we were not together, he was forgetting I existed, he would never check on me, not even if I was sick.

        "text": "I know that some people have also told me they feel the same, but I always feel like it isn't normal? almost everyone I talk to about this find it weird. I know a lot of people with ADHD who absolutely INHALE energy drinks and coffee for energy, and I just feel like I'm missing something? I've been told this is a possible ADHD symptom (I'm already diagnosed with it, but the caffeine thing has been bugging me for a while now). Sugar, on the other hand, makes me feel energized. So I often find myself drinking a lot of sugary drinks to power through school, but I hate it because it feels (and is) unhealthy.",

I’m pretty sure it’s related to my adhd, but I am still getting an apnea test. \n\nThat being said, does anyone here take their stimulant meds at night to help with sleep? \n\nSometimes when I take one of my adderall during the day I get very sleepy. I’m really curious if it would help my sleep, but I’m reluctant to take one at bedtime because it is mostly energizing.",

I didn’t think it would be this bad being off of ADHD medication, but my ability to do a lot of what I used to just seems diminished. If anyone knows of anywhere in PBC that may have it in stock it would be so appreciated. I’ve called so many pharmacies the last 3 months and I just can’t keep doing this.",

I’m hearing that there is now a shortage of Ritalin as well, and my pharmacist recommended I switch medications, that’s how bad it is. Can anyone attest to the availability of other stimulants such as focalin, vyvanse, etc.   What are your doctors recommending?",
