I over heard the following exchange. I came into it part way through:\n\n\nBR: Bus company representative\n\nSOL: Shrill older lady, about 50yo (also shit out of luck)\n\nSOL: But I have to get (city 4 hours away) for Christmas!\n\nBR: I’m sorry ma’am, the bus is sold out. \n\nSOL: But I paid for a taxi and came all this way to the station! I need to get on this bus!\n\nBR: I understand, but the bus is sold out. We don’t have any more seats available until after Christmas. \n\nSOL: what am I supposed to do?\n\nBR: I don’t know ma’am \n\nSOL: I’m disabled! You have to let me on the bus! (She had a cane with her)\n\nBR: I’m sorry ma’am, there are no available seats, they are all full. \n\nSOL: can’t you just give me someone else’s seat?\n\nBR: no ma’am, I can’t. \n\nSOL: this is totally unacceptable! You should set seats aside just in case someone needs one! \n\nBR: ...\n\n\nThis went on for a long, long time. She kept bringing up how she’d paid for a taxi, she was disabled, how she really needed to get on the bus (as opposed to the rest of us, I guess), how they should set aside seats just in case, how they should give her someone else’s seat. I don’t know how the bus company would implement a merit-based seat system, but she was adamant that THEY were at fault for not saving a seat just in case, as opposed to her for not booking a seat on the busiest travel day of the year. It must have been 15 minutes. I don’t know how the bus guy kept it together. I would have felt bad for her, spending Christmas alone, if she hadn’t been demanding they kick someone else off the bus to spend their Christmas alone. \n\nTL;DR Entitled lady insists she be given someone else’s seat on Christmas Eve cause she couldn’t be arsed to book one in advance. \n\n",

        "text": "This happened when i was around 6 or 7. I grew up on an island so summers are hot and people like to go there for vacations. This happened one summer while I was on school holiday. I had to go to work with my mom and in her lunch break we went shopping and stopped at a bookshop to get some school supplies and a new book for me as I was an avid reader and i had finished the book i carried to keep me occupied. I also should mention that i also suffer from a chronic illness and need to keep hydrated. Obvious downside at such a young age I needed to go to the toilet alot. I told my mom and we were too far from her office to go back there so she asked a store clerk explain my child has popular xyz condition and she needs to toilet can we please use your. Clerk denied my mom saying it was staff only. My mom trying to be reasonable asked again saying there isn't a public one near by please can she just use it. Store clerk refused again. At this point in very much doing the i need to pee dance pacing looking at my mom. \n\n\nMy mom at this point is visibly upset and has what my cousin and i refer to as her scary face on. She looks at me put down her shopping basket filled of school supplies and school books, point to a corner where to 2 bookshelves meet and said to me \"pee over there \" . I look horrified the store clerk looks horrified. My mom still looking at me says \" what you need to pee go into that corner and pee \". I should also mention my mom was pretty strict and had a if i say something 3 times your gonna feel it ( it was well over 20 years ago and she never used to follow through. The treat was enough to make me comply) so i started walking over to the corner. Store clerk now realising my mom isnt joking stops me and let's me use to store bathroom. \nShe thanks the clerk after and buys our stuff. At the office she then wrote a letter to that branch of the store and to the head office naming the clerk and how they treated us ( she used a typewriter if that helps to put how long ago this was) . \n\n\nTLDR: store clerk refused to let small child with chronic illness(me) use to toilet. Mom order me to pee in store before clerk relented. Still complained to head office anyway. \n\n\n\nEdit: didnt think i had to say this but this happened in a 3rd world country. The options for a public toilet were non existent you either had to ask the store you were in or hold it till you could get home or the office or try find an empty alley way ( very hard to do in the town center) to pee in. Many walls had signs on them saying dont piss here. \n\n\nYes my mom bullied the store employee into letting me use the loo but i wouldn't have made it out the front door without leaving a trail of pee. I had very bad bladder control and not ashamed to mentioned i still wet the bed my early teens because of the amount of water i had to drink to stay hydrated. \n\nIt also wasnt a question if i was ill. I was small for my age i had a very yellow hue to my skin tone and the whites of my eyes were also yellow. This was all due to my medical condition causing jaundice. I never knew the whites of my eyes to be white till i moved to the uk. When i am really dehydrated they changed from yellow to sickly green. The green that puss is or when you have a really bad cold and the snot is that horrible sickly green colour. Back then I was drinking 2 litres of water a day minimum. As an adult when i go back to my home country  i go from drinking in the uk 4 liters of water minimum to keep the white of my eyes white ( people really freak out when they turn yellow) to drinking 3 gallons of water. I always have a water bottle on me because getting dehydrated means pain. And i dont mean oh I have a headache and my body hurts a bit.  it means im in the hospital screaming my head off after receiving the maximum dose of morphine i can have. Best way the describe it is that it feels like a truck just slamed into me. It hurts to move a finger. Google sickle cell anaemia \n\n\nThis store as well we were regular customers. Not much else a child that cant go outside to play to do other than read and watch tv and with a whole 2 tv channels i obviously read a lot...... we have a room where a wall and a half is just books and even more boxes of books under my bed. Other clerks had allowed us in the past and im guessing no one passed on the message. The store held childrens book club weekly meetings. What in the world do you do when those kids need to pee. Tell there parents take them to the back of the shop and squat behind the dumpster and do your business? No head office told them to let kids at least be able to use the store bathroom with adult supervision. ",

        "text": "First time posting so please bare with me :\\) tl;dr at bottom\n\nWas online shopping at a teenage Southern Cali themed store a couple years back and once I got my clothes in decided I wanted to take a couple items in for a return. I showed up over Memorial Day weekend to the store in the local mall and browsed around. Wound up finding a top I liked and went up to the counter. The woman starts to ring me up but then states she cannot do the return portion as she is not authorized. She calls over her manager who throws an absolute fit. He refuses to take my return even though they are unworn, tags on, and within the 30 day window. He tells me to go to a different store since he will not process returns and continues to be hostile. Completely confused and getting flustered I decide to leave and just do it on another day.\n\nA day passes and I decide I need to get these clothes back so I return. A different manager begins to process it and then out of no where the schmuck manager from before appears. He starts screaming about how he refuses to process my very valid return and that if I won't leave the store he will call mall security on me. Mind you I am 16 at the time and being quite pleasant. Customers in line start to stare, things get very awkward, and the manager just keeps yelling. I ask him why he won't take the return when it is completely valid and he just won't cooperate. He calls mall security on me, to which this poor mall cop just looks at the manager and goes \"really, you called me because you won't process her return\" and walks out with me. At this point I could not deal with the insanity of this man so leaving with mall security was best.\n\nI get on the phone with corporate customer service and tell my story. They are quite apologetic \\(although they only wound up compensating me with a 50&amp;#37; off coupon \\*insert eyeroll\\*\\) and explain they will talk to this store manager and that I am more than able to return my clothes to any corporate location so he should not have denied me. They say I can mail the clothes back for no charge and a full refund \\(normally a charge for shipping, hence why I was returning them in person\\), but I decide to be petty and a few days later walk back into the same store and stare at the dumbass manager the whole time the return is being processed. I don't know if he ever wound up facing any major backlash for it, but getting the satisfaction of finally returning the clothes to his direct store was worth it.\n\ntl;dr: crazy store manager calls mall security after refusing to take valid returns, gets crapped on by corporate and I pettily enjoy making all my returns on his next shift\n\nside note: to the best of my knowledge, the reason he did not want the clothes returned to his location was because it would deduct from his sales for the holiday weekend. That or he just loved abusing power. Needless to say, never shopped there again.",

Call me a child, but I love going to this rodeo-fair. I go every year. Last year, I went with one of my friends. She brought money to spend on the actual carnival, and I didn’t, because I didn’t feel like stopping in the convention or trying out carnival games. She, however, did.\n\nI enjoyed watching her play the games and win little prizes. It was fun for her, and neither of us really did anything with friends, so it was enjoyable to just be around her. Then we get to the ring toss game, you know, the standard one where you throw rings onto bottles. \n\nShe loved this game, and I recalled a time when my brother had won a giant Pikachu stuffed animal a while back in Vegas, so I told her she should try it. She put five bucks down, and the guy running it decided to give us both rings, for the price of one. I politely declined, but he answered with “Come on, it’s a carnival”, and gave me the rings. He kept doing this whenever she put down money, too. \n\nThis stuck with me, and I did have fun with it, even though we didn’t win anything. I wasn’t in the best place then, but it made me happy. This weekend’s rodeo weekend, and it’s with the same company, too. I hope to see him again, or at least pay the kindness forewords this year.\n\n",

My dad had made a reservation at a hotel several days prior, and when we arrived, the young Mexican girl at the from desk claimed to have no record of us having made a reservation, and wouldn't you know it, they were all booked up for the night. \n\nNow, my dad is a very pleasant man to converse and do business with, but dick him over and he'll quickly show you he's not the type to get pushed around. He is a scary looking, steely\\-gazed bald man with a well\\-practiced 'don't fuck with me' demeanor that he brings out on command when needed.\n\nThe conversation that follows is paraphrased from Spanish. The smug front desk girl will be FDG and my scary dad will be D.\n\nFDG: \"I'm sorry sir, it doesn't look like you have a reservation with us, and we are fully booked.\"\n\nD: \"There must be a mistake, I spoke to an employee here and was confirmed for a room for my family.\"\n\nFDG: \"But your name's not in the book. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.\" \\*Smug smile\\*\n\nMy dad then saw the hotel's scheduling notebook open on the counter and leaned over to get a look. FDG began to pull the book away from him with an alarmed expression, and, smelling a rat, dad pulled it out of her hands and checked the reservation log. Sure enough, there was a smudge and faint outline where our \\(very non\\-Hispanic\\) last name had been erased and a different name given our room instead. This was just about when all hell broke loose. \n\nD: \"What is going on, here?? You gave our room away!\"\n\nFDG, very nervous: \\*splutters and tries to deny it\\*\n\nD: \"You WILL fix this! Right now! My family drove all the way from \\(city 6 hours away\\) and we are going to stay in THIS hotel, TONIGHT.\"\n\nFDG: \"That won't be possible, sir there are no rooms available!\"\n\nWhen dad gets warmed up, he likes to bluff.\n\nD: \"Ok! Well, we'll just sleep out here in the lobby, if there are no more rooms available. KIDS! Get your suitcases, start making camp on these couches here, spread out!\" We gleefully obey.\n\nFDG: \\*visibly panicked\\* \"Oh no, sir! You can't do that!\" \n\nD: \"Well, we aren't going anywhere! If you are going to deny us a place to sleep, call the police!\"\n\nFDG: \"Well sir, that's not necessary! There's been no crime committed!\"\n\nD: \\*Rips out the edited reservation sheet that used to have our name on it\\*\n\n \"There! NOW a crime's been committed, I just damaged hotel property! Now call the cops, and when they get here I can explain to them how you committed fraud against us by selling our reserved hotel room out from under us!\"\n\nFDG: \\*guiltily bursts into tears\\*\n\nDad reams her a little more with a lot of finger\\-stabbing on the counter, and eventually FDG gets on the phone and cries into it for a few minutes. Twenty minutes later a simperingly apologetic and grovelling FDG  escorted us up to the hotel owner's private reserved penthouse suite \\(there were still some of his suits and shoes and personal items hanging in the closets\\) and we were comped our entire stay. \n\nTL;DR: Smug front desk girl tries to pull a fast one on my dad and double\\-book our hotel room. Dad doesn't play games, catches her in a lie, makes her cry, and gets us comped the owner's penthouse suite. ",

There’s a cafe I frequent on average once a week.\nToday I entered, spotted a table that was free and also has just the right amount of light to be useful for me but without glareTable A). I started heading towards it and a waitress who I’m familiar with stopped me and said “oh I need to sit you on this side of the restaurant” (the opposite side). I was a bit puzzled as to why but went with it. But the table she was leading me to (table B) has no light to it. “That table is too dark, shall I take this one instead?” (Table C), pointing to one nearer to a window.\n“But you always sit there!” , pointing to Table B. \nIt pissed me off because not only do I not normally sit there, I’m giving her the information she needs to meet my accessibility requirements and she’s treating me like I’m being a difficult customer. I’m not a difficult customer. I’m just trying to do my best living with a visual impairment (I was also with my mother who is ageing, and my young child, and my guide dog). I’m just trying to pick a table where I’ll be able to see my food. \nAs soon as I sat down at the third table, a couple walked in and walked over to Table A and sat at it! There’s no reservations in this place, they just obviously decided they liked that table.\nSo I’d like serving staff to know, please listen to what a person with a disability is saying. \nThey are not being difficult, they are just trying to meet their needs. What is difficult is living with a disability 24/7.\nI felt that when she said “ but you always sit there!”, she was doubting my visual impairment. Like many visual impairment, lighting is crucial and lighting and shadows change all the time so what might work one day, doesn’t work another day. I constantly have to adapt and be flexible, risk assess and manage my environment. It’s exhausting. \nAs a customer I’ve flagged her up as being rude and ignorant which is a shame for her, but I’m going to let it go now I’ve vented. ",

        "text": "This happened a little while ago, but I'm still holding the grudge and I’m baffled by what happened, so decided to share. \n\nI was meeting my Dad and Step-Mum for one last lunch in the city where I live before they moved out of the country. They'd heard about a new-ish restaurant serving food and wacky cocktails, and wanted to try it out. I'd been for drinks there but not food, so was happy to give it a go. They’d only decided they wanted to go there on the day of meeting, so we weren’t able to book in advance – I warned them that this might mean we couldn’t get in there and needed to pick somewhere else, as it was quite busy when I’d been in the past, but they were happy either way. Cool, easy for me. \n\nI arrived before my folks and asked the FOH team if they had any tables for dining that afternoon. Luckily for us, they had a table just leaving, it’d be ready in a sec – score. I said that that’d be great, thanks very much, and the FOH team asked if I wanted to sit down at the table straight away while waiting for the other two to join me. Now, my Dad and Step-Mum are unfamiliar with the city where I live and obviously the restaurant (which isn’t very easy to find if you don't know what you're looking for) so I said “If you don’t mind, I’ll wait out front in case I need to direct them”. They said fine, so I waited just outside the doors. I should add that this isn’t a standalone restaurant – it’s inside another building, so when I say I stood outside, I was the other side of a clear glass door, feet from where we’d just been chatting, and in view of the woman I’d talked to. \n\nIt was no more than five minutes before my folks arrived, and we immediately went into the restaurant. I went to the same woman I’d talked to before, and told her that everyone was here and we were ready to sit down please. She looked at me and said “Oh, we don’t have any tables now, it’ll be about an hour or so” – sorry, what? I was split between wanting to flip a table and trying not to be That Guy, so calmly said “I thought we could have the table that was free a mo ago?” and she replied that they gave it away because I left, and asked if we wanted to wait for the next free table. We were all hungry and I was fuming, so I lost my capability to question it any further, said no and left as politely as I could before ranting and raving to my folks as soon as we got outside. \n\nDid I miss something there?! I didn't realise that by not sitting down immediately, I'd forfeit the table? I didn’t put in a complaint at the time and it feels like there’s no point now as it was last year, but I still scowl in the restaurant’s direction every time I walk past. \n",

        "text": "There is a lot of backstory to this I don't feel like including, but suffice it to say, after trying and failing multiple times to reset our password for the account for my husband's pay\\-as\\-you\\-go phone, I decided that I needed to call today during regular business hours when I had a block of available time to try to get it fixed. It was a good time, baby was taking a nap and the kids were doing their screen time, so I called.\n\nThe first time I got through wasn't too bad. The first guy was a bit frustrating to deal with, English was obviously not his first language and so it took a little while to make it clear what my problem was, and after a trying a few things, he transferred me to his supervisor. That lady understood much better, but still couldn't fix the problem, so she transferred me again. The third lady tried a few things, and in the middle of the conversation we got disconnected. Not their fault, I got a call while we were on, and I think my phone somehow dropped both calls when the person calling gave up. We had been on the phone for 66 minutes, and they had sent me 4 different passwords in an attempt to get me logged on.\n\nAt this point the baby was awake, but still in a good mood, and I didn't want to start from scratch so I called back. I explained to the guy who answered what had happened, he laughed a bit, and asked if it was ok to put me on hold so he could get me to a supervisor who could help. I was fine with that, put the phone on speaker while I waited, and then got me to the next person.\n\nThis woman. Oh my goodness, this woman! I am not the swearing type, but she pushed me awfully close to the edge. She started out by assuming I am a total idiot, which ok, I get. Tech support people have a lot of idiots to deal with. She decided that I was just entering the password wrong. Cuz the people I spent an hour on the phone with didn't check that apparently. /s\n\nI explained to her that I had tried copying and pasting the new passwords as well as typing them in several times each just in case I did type them wrong, those types of passwords have random capital letters and stuff to be sure they are entered right. She decided to send another new password just to be sure. I was fine with that, if I could show her I knew what I was doing, maybe we could get this fixed.\n\nShe sends me the password. It doesn't work \\(surprise, surprise!\\). So she asks me to read the password to her so she can enter it in on her computer. Because I MUST be entering it wrong. Ok, whatever. I read it to her. Four times, before she gets it right, even with me using words to help her get the letters right. I don't know the proper system for it, but she didn't either. She enters it in. It doesn't work. She asks if I am sure I gave it to her right. I verify it AGAIN. Then she decides it isn't the right one. She says, \"Are you sure this is the right email? The one I sent you?\"\n\nMe, \"Yes, I'm sure\"\n\nHer, \"Check again please.\"\n\nMe, \"I have four emails from you guys, this one was sent 7 minutes ago.\"\n\nHer, \"Twenty minutes ago? I haven't been on the phone with you that long.\"\n\nMe, \"No, 7.\" After a minute, \"It was sent at 3:14 pm my time, it is now 3:21 my time. 7 minutes ago.\"\n\nUp to now I had been courteous with her, maybe a little curt when I was annoyed, but as nice as possible under the circumstances. But this is when I really started to get frustrated. She says, \"You need to create a new email account and then call us back and give it to us.\"\n\nI reply, still nicely, \"I have a different email we can use for a username if that is what you mean.\"\n\nHer, \"You need to create a new account.\"\n\nMe, \"Wait, a new account? If you mean on your website, it won't let me. Here, I will show you.\"\n\nI open up the page again, click on Create an account, and enter the phone number, telling her what I am doing as I go. After entering the phone number, it makes me verify who I am with the security question, and then tells me the email address to use to log in, which I already new. There is NO option to create a new account. I tell her this, and she just keeps repeating, \"You need to create a new email account and call us back.\"\n\nI got frustrated and yelled, because she was acting like she was about to hang up, \"I don't understand what you want! If you need a different email address, I have one, but it won't let me create a new account!\" I was yelling, but I was seriously about to start crying, and you could tell from my voice.\n\nThen she just ignored me. I could still hear background noise, but she didn't respond when I talked. We had been on the phone for less than 15 minutes, she didn't even try!\n\nI was so angry at this point I wanted to throw something. I finally hung up after a minute or so of, \"Hello? are you there?\", and called back AGAIN.\n\nWhen the last lady picked up, I was still so upset. I explained what had happened the last two calls, trying not to cry, and then apologized for being so frustrated, that it was not her fault and I was doing my best not to take it out on her. She apologized for what had happened, tried one last thing, and then said she had to escalate it to a different department. She typed up an explanation of the problem and what we had tried, then told me to try again after 24 hours, and if it didn't work to call back and give an incident number she gave me. \n\nI was fine with that. We have a few more days before we absolutely HAVE to add more minutes to the phone, which is why we need to access the account. I thanked her and hung up.\n\nKind of an embarrassing side note, my 7 year old came in while I was on the phone the third time and asked why I was still on the phone. I told him we were having issues getting things working, and he said, \"Maybe they are just stupid.\" Right next to me. Very loudly. I am sure she heard. I told him he shouldn't say that about people, and no, the lady I was talking to wasn't stupid, she was trying to get the problem figured out. Then I apologized to the lady I was talking to.\n\nLooking back on it, I think that the worker who ignored me just didn't even want to do her job, and I really hope that it was recorded and she gets in trouble. I don't generally want people to get in trouble, but she deserves it, I think she made up the \"Make a new account\" thing to just get me off her phone.",

I approached the counter and the pharmacy tech-who seemed to be having a bad day/just hated her job was the one to “help” me. \n\nI asked her if they had boric acid there and she twisted up her face and stared at me like I had grown a third eye. After not saying anything for a few seconds and just giving me a dirty look, she asked “you mean here...at the pharmacy?” As she was asking she was already shaking her head “no”. It was obvious she uneducated about boric acid and it’s use in medical preparations. \n\nBefore I gave her the chance to turn me away, I pointed to the pharmacist behind her and asked, “Can you ask her, please?”  \n\nThe pharmacist was very polite and said, “we don’t have any in stock and can’t order it like our stand-alone stores, but if you go to one, they’ll be able to help you.” I thanked her and walked away, saying nothing to the pharmacy tech because it was obvious I already “bothered her”.\n\nI was and still am annoyed. I’m generally a nice and understanding person and am not rude to people even when they act like a-holes, but I kind of regret not telling her she needed to change her attitude, or saying to her what I titled the post as. \n\nEdit: a word ",

        "text": "I'm on mobile so please forgive formatting and errors. \n\n\nLet me preface this by saying this happened almost a year ago. Also I worked in restaurants from the time I was little until I was about 23. I literally lived above the restaurant my grandparents owned when I was kid. Customer service is something I proudly excel at. I have been invited to weddings, have had customers wait 20 minutes just so I would be their server. I've made many friends from old crazy men to kids who loved it when I would do card tricks and juggle for them while their parents ate. I met one little boy who was blind from a tumor and his mom told me he would ask to go out to eat just to interact with me. I've always treated others how I've wanted to be treated and I've gone out of my way to take care of customers everywhere I worked. There's just something that makes me happy when i know I've taken good care of someone and they give me a genuine thank you. I'm now in US Army as a cavalry scout. And that's where our story begins.\n\n\nMy troop went out to eat to celebrate my graduation from bc and move into the ait portion of OSUT. We went to a local museum that had a restaurant in it. The waiter was an ass. He answered a phone call in the middle of me ordering. Never refilled my drink. Charged me twice for my meal. Was rude to all(6) of us at the table. This was our first social interaction in weeks and it sucked. I was over it. He came by with the check and said if we didn't leave a tip that he would take our names and tell our drill sergeants. I had overheard him threaten another table with the same thing and I couldn't believe it. I was like who tf does this guy think he is? I worked in food service and would never say that to anyone. I had already put $2 on the table when i jokingly asked, \"has it been that kind of night?\" i shit you not good guy says, \"yeah, I've been getting stiffed all night, and did you know that $2 is an unacceptable tip for a $24 tab? \" this motherfucker. I understand getting stiffed. I've been there before, but you can't treat every table shitty because you're having a bad night. That's probably why he was getting stiffed. I told him that I tip based on service and I had shitty service so he gets a shitty tip. He asked how and i explained answering your phone when someone is ordering would have gotten you fired at any restaurant i have ever worked at. Never refilled my drink. Double charged for my meal and wouldnt fix it until i asked someone else to. Overall you were rude and unprofessional. I picked my tip up, wrote (my last name) in big letters on a piece of paper and told him he was more than welcome to give my name to the Drill sergeants. Everyone else at my table agreed with me and picked up their tips. This guy was an ass. This was the worse service i had ever received anywhere. Saw something on FB that reminded me of this experience so I thought I would share.\n\n\nOnce again sorry for format/grammar errors.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago when I made the mistake of ordering from a popular sandwich delivery chain, one that prides itself on speedy delivery. \n\n\nWhat you need to know about me is that I'm pretty easy going when it comes to food service. The last thing I want to do is upset folks who are handling my food, largely because I don't want to give them any reason to tamper with it. \n\nI'm polite, I don't complain, I don't send food back or ask for compensation, and I always tip. Apparently, that's not always good enough, but I digress.\n\nI was feeling a bit under the weather and didn't feel like cooking so my wife and I decided to order a couple sandwiches for dinner. She ordered hers with extra peppers and a bag of chips. I got mine with a cookie and a drink. \n\nAnd then we waited.\n\nAn hour goes by, and I start to worry. We had ordered online, and delivery from this place usually doesn't take very long. (hence their tagline) Maybe something went wrong. Maybe they're busy. \n\n30 more minutes go by. Fuck.\n\nI call up the store, and am greeted by a friendly employee (FE)\n\n&gt; Me: \"Hi, sorry I was just calling to check on my order, we ordered about an hour and a half ago and haven't received it yet.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; FE: \"Oh, sorry about that\" *confirms order details* \"Yes, it should be out to you soon, I apologize for the long wait we only have one driver this evening and we're busier than usual.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: \"No worries, I just wanted to make sure it was still coming.\"\n\nApproximately 2 hours after we had originally ordered, the delivery driver shows up. Having been delivery drivers ourselves, we give him the benefit of the doubt, and tip him normally. No complaints.\nThen it hits me. \n\nHe forgot my drink. \n\nI rush outside hoping to catch him, but he's gone. \n\nNow, ordinarily I might have shrugged it off, but since I'd already waited 2 hours for my food I decided to call back and was once again greeted by FE. \n\nI explain the situation and he offers to have it sent out immediately, with a free cookie of my choice for the inconvenience. \n\nI ask if he can just take off the price of the drink from my order, and he refuses, so I accept his offer. \n\nAnother **45 minutes** go by before the delivery driver returns. \n\nI'm pretty annoyed at this point, but I thank him for the drink, and **apologize to him** since it is now just 10 minutes to closing time. \n\nNearly **3 hours** after I originally ordered my meal, I sit down to enjoy my long-awaited beverage. \n\nI open the bag that contained my consolation cookie, and surprise: It's the wrong cookie, but more importantly **there's no straw**. \n\nUp to this point, you might have been wondering why the title of this post is \"Thank goodness he forgot the straw.\" \n\nI had no reason to suspect that the delivery driver was angry with me. I had been polite. I didn't complain about the extremely late delivery, and I had tipped him generously. I hadn't wanted him to make an extra trip just to bring my drink. I just didn't want to pay for something I hadn't received. Fuck me, right?\n\nYou see, in the absence of a straw, I had to take off the lid to enjoy my soda. Upon doing so, I realized in a moment of rage and disgust that I had been saved by his incompetence. \n\nThere, on top of the ice was an unmistakable glob of translucent off-white slime; A big, fat, hate-infused lugie. \n\n\n\n\nFrom there, it went exactly as you might expect. I proceeded to call the store for a third time, and as calmly as possible, I asked to speak to the manager, who was cooperative. \n\nThis was the result:\n\n*  I received a full refund, obviously, and the assurance that the delivery driver would not be receiving the tip for that order, and that he would most likely be let go.\n\n* I was offered a generous store credit, which I declined since A) I would not be ordering from them any time soon, and B) I didn't want it to seem like I just wanted free food. \n\n* I was contacted by the regional manager, who was extremely apologetic and understanding, and tried again to compensate me with free food, which I again declined. He also confirmed that the delivery driver had been fired. \n\n* I was mailed an apology letter from the corporate office which included a gift card (which I gave away). \n\n\nI have since resumed ordering from there, but I no longer get drinks. Every time though, I still think about how I narrowly avoided becoming a victim of his poorly executed revenge. \n\nThank goodness he forgot the straw.\n\nTL;DR: Why say lot word when few word do trick? Me order sandwich. Take long time. Driver forget drink! Me say I no pay for drink. They say no, send drink anyway. No straw, me open lid. Spit in my drink! Anger! He fired. End.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold stranger! \nEdit: A word",

I have heard several rude comments about me well shopping or on the bus.( side note the bus system in the U.S. sucks) I know that I look like a redneck and don’t talk much, but I felt offended by these people’s comments. Especial because their opinions about me were based on the way I look. Sorry if I offended anyone I just wanted to get this out there",

        "text": "On my  Wishlist, Mario Tennis Aces showed \n\n\"Coupon: 47.99 Off At Checkout\".\n\nHoly shit, what is this? That's an insane discount. unfortunately, it did not apply. This is my first day of having their special discount program so I wasn't sure what was up. Was it a real discount? Why wasn't it applying?\n\nI got into a chat with a rep and showed him my screenshot. He thought it was a screenshot of an unaffiliated third party website, but I told him no, it's the website!\n\nSo I offered a photo of the app on my phone. He still thought it was a third party site, so I took a picture of the app open in the \"dashboard\" on my phone, showing the app's title bar. Then I took a picture on my computer of the full web page.\n\nHe was still skeptical. He said \"If our site showed this deal, we could honor it.\", still not believing it was really the site. He added that things like this can be edited very easily- so I offered a video!\n\nI recorded myself highlighting text in the chat, then opening the site, going to my wish list ,finding Mario Tennis, highlighting the discount, and clicking it to reveal the terms of \"Discount applied at checkout\".\n\nHe said he would look into it and after a long wait, he said that he thinks the discount was for someone else. As in, if someone else was viewing my wishlist, they'd get that discount to buy the game for me. Which sounds weird, but whatever!\n\nHe said as a one-time thing, they'd honor it!\n\nHe told me he was putting a note on the order, once I placed it, and when it ships out in a month, he will process the 47.99 refund. I also got a transcript of the chat in case that doesn't happen.\n\nThe total was 49.33. Subtract 47.99 from that, and you get 1.34.\n\nIn a month, I might have Mario Tennis Aces for a dollar and 34 cents. Absolutelty amazing! I thought it was likely a bug, but you never know- and the rep said it wasn't a bug, just a promo I shouldn't have seen. It never hurts to ask! \n\nAmazing service, absolutely incredible!!!\n\n",

        "text": "Long\n\nI moved to a new town 100 miles away from where I previously lived and found a dentist that came highly recommended. I felt like I was getting hugs when I walked into the dentist office, they acted so happy to have me there, like they’ve known me forever.  It turns out that both the dentist and assistant are friends of friends.  I hardly know anyone in this new area, so I have a connection and was thrilled to have found such a place. \n\nI had my cleaning and was told I need a crown, but I already knew that.  I went in and got Novocain and he drilled my old crown to the nub beneath it.  I was fitted for the permanent crown and a temporary crown which I got that day.  A couple of weeks later I was in for the installation of the new crown. He puts it in, says “bite down” and I hear a little crunch I figured was the glue from the temporary.  “Bite down again.”  The permanent crown disintegrated!  What!?  They’d never had that happen before!  It was like a sand castle that you pour water on.  On goes the temporary crown again and they ordered another permanent crown.  Oh, did I say the crown was made out of wonderful lifetime\\-guaranteed material?  Something new, I guess.  So much for that.\n\nI go in for my next permanent crown.  We’re joking around about the last one.  This one has just a 5\\-year warranty.   Definitely sub\\-par compared to the first one.  He puts it in…bite down…he takes it out and grinds it a bit, puts it in…bite down….it cracked!  No kidding.  It actually cracked!  Two down!  He decides that the crown was too thin on top and so he needed to grind down the nub some more.  More Novocain and another impression – for the new temporary and for the new permanent.  I go on my merry way drooling all over myself from the Novocain.\n\nThat night I was eating and I bit on that side and the temporary crown cracked and fell off into my mouth.  It had a big V\\-shaped chunk out of it.\n\nSo I called them and went in the next day.  The assistant had to make a new temporary crown because mine was no good anymore.  The thing she uses to make the mold was still there, but falling apart, so she had to hold it in my mouth while the gunk formed.  Once the temporary crown was ready she glued it back in and away I went.  \\(It is a 20 minute drive each way and I have to go during work\\-hours, so I’m missing some work, which is ok, but still.\\)\n\nI wasn’t home long when the temp crown fell out of my mouth.  Seriously.  So I called them and said “What time should I come in tomorrow to get that temporary glued back in?”  They couldn’t believe it fell out!  I heard the receptionist kind of yelling back to the dentist and he couldn’t believe it!  They are closed on Friday but the dentist was going to be there doing bills, so he said he’d glue it back on.   I went in, we laughed about my bad luck.  I told him that people are telling me to go to a different dentist but that I like it there….\n\nThat temporary crown stayed put. When I went in yesterday to get my 3rd permanent crown installed we were joking about my jaws of steel and the assistant said she said a little prayer that this would work.  The lab person came out and patted my arm \\(I love her\\) and we laughed a bit about my bad luck.  Dentist said not to tell anyone who my dentist is!  It was really fun.  So the dentist fits the new crown over the nub and asks me to bite down.  I had my mouth wide open and said “I ont hahnt hoo” and everyone laughed.  I bit down and it felt a bit high so I told him so.  He pries it out, and no kidding, it flips to the back of my throat and I SWALLOWED IT!  Yup.  I swallowed it.  The room burst out laughing and we were laughing so hard our cheeks hurt and tears were running down our faces.  So, the temporary crown went back on.\n\nOh, we’re not going to be using the tooth that is still on its way south.  Nope.  I am not going to go hunting for it and then have it put in my mouth.  Sure it can be cleaned, but just the thought of where it’s been…..\n\nTLDR: Needed a new crown.  Broke two versions of the new crown and swallowed one.",

        "text": "Tl;dr I got played today by a cosmetic store (which I can’t name bc of subreddit rules, unfortunately). I don’t know how they ended up in Canadian malls but man. I was lucky and only lost like $20, there are horror stories of people who’ve lost hundreds at the same location, and this company has stores worldwide. Rip.\n\nSo I was exploring a mall today with my boyfriend. We had just made a couple of purchases and was planning on heading back home when a sales person in front of a cosmetic store asked if we wanted to try a sample of their lotion. \n\nI go for the sample but the next thing I know the guy’s trying to get us into the store, saying he wants to show us something cool. I’m skeptical, but thought there’d be no harm in listening to what he had to say. Big mistake. \n\nHe uses this magical nail buffer on me and my nails shine like they’ve never shone before. I’m amazed. Being a person who never really took care of my hands, nail care was completely new to me (something  which I realized he exploited after my purchase).\n\nThe sales guy invited us to sit down, asked us for our names and addressed us like friends. He showed us a bunch of skin products, saying “Oh this is $200 but don’t worry. You’re students right? I just want to show you, you don’t need to buy it.” \n\nHe had me fooled, I genuinely was convinced then that he was passionate about what he was doing, and excited about the products he was selling. He offered the nail buffer at half price, with a bunch of extra strips, a second buffer, and a lifetime warrantee thrown in, all for the whopping price of $25. (I found out later you can get these at a drug store for like 5 bucks, and on amazon for cheaper).\n \nBut yeah. I was a dumbass and fell for it hook line and sinker. I had inklings of doubt, like “oh you should price check online” or “oh you should look at the reviews for this store” but I dismissed them since the sales guy was so nice. The signs were so obvious in hindsight. He was really pushy, despite how nice he was. The store suddenly went from being empty to having 4 employees on. He kept offering extra things for free every time I made an effort to leave the store. And if that wasn’t obvious enough, he informed me that all purchases were final and non exchangeable. Like a fool I just paid and told him to have a good day, and then it dawned on my how stupid I was. \n\nI looked around at the other employees as I left the store and they all gave me small glances with eyes that I could only describe as unfriendly and...sly? Unsympathetic? Smug almost? Which really just reaffirmed my original suspicions. \n\nI looked up the store right after and lo and behold, tons of other reviews and stories of people being scammed. (Edit: there were stories of sales reps putting products on customers without consent, overcharging, offering free facials but then having the customer pay for them, taking customer’s cards and swiping for them without clear knowledge of what they were paying for...not to mention some people found their products to contain ingredients that are nonorganic if not toxic). So yeah. I feel like a fool now but at least I only lost $20.",

        "text": "I placed a very important order (squirt guns for my kids) for online pickup at a major retailer that mostly sells clothes, but also housewares and toys (naturally). I go to pick up the order at customer service, and they have the typical black retractable nylon divider to keep all the folks standing in line off to the side so others can reach the back room or restrooms or whatever. \n\nExcept this store has you stand on either side of the divider; one side for returns, the other for online order pickups. I am the only person on “my side” of the line, and I end up getting major stink eye from a lady on the other side who has a return. After huffing a few times she barks at me “Well are you going to get in line or not?!” I said “I’m just following the sign,” gestured to it, and followed with “I’m really not sure how standing over here is any different.” The lady huffs again as if I’m ruining her day. \n\nA few seconds later a store associate walks up to me off the floor and processes my order pickup from a handheld device. As I was walking away, I said to the lady (who was still waiting for her turn) “I guess there IS a perk to standing on this side!” She didn’t seem to appreciate that. My son asked me when we left what her problem was. IDK kiddo, IDK.\n\nTL;DR: I followed store signage to wait in a certain place at customer service and got attitude from a cranky lady also standing in line.",

        "text": "Another move story on here reminded me of the last time I moved houses.\n\nThere was a delay with getting my first credit card (they shipped one with the wrong name on it so it took two additional weeks) which caused a delay in finding a vehicle to rent (need a credit card to book a vehicle).\n\nMove day was Sept 1, so going with the biggest truck rental company in my city was not an option (the rep practically laughed at me on Aug 15th when I asked). So I went with somewhat more upscale company that had trucks available in my area.\n\nI don't have a drivers license (It's not really necessary in my city for day-to-day shit), so I had a friend to actually do the driving part of the move, to be paid in pizza and beer.\n\nMoving day comes and it's going to be somewhat complicated - We have to go from the rental place to my current apartment, to my girlfriends house (we were moving in together for the first time), to a furniture place owned by a friend-of-a-friend who had some free shit for us, finally to the new apartment.\n\nI meet my friend at the rental office and oops! Turns out that my friend is actually too young for them to allow him to drive a truck. Fair enough, but now it looks like we're up shits creek (I had to be out of my apartment that day). Can't believe I didn't think of this.\n\nPanicking, we go outside and start looking up other places in the area. We find a few places but I suggest we try a particular one that has something like 1.5 star on google reviews. My hope was that they'd be sketchy enough to not care that my friend was ~only~ 23.\n\nTurns out I was correct! This place had a single box van that was in pretty rough shape. Seems that this particular company specialized in taking vehicles that were involved in accidents and fixing them up enough to be barely drivable. That meant that the vehicle had rented had some... quirks, such as not going above 50kph, constantly thinking the passenger-side door was open, and a couple spots in the box itself held together with duct tape.\n\nAny port in a storm, I suppose. We take the truck out and are about an hour behind schedule at this point, however, other than that, the move goes without a hitch. We actually never manage to gain or lose any time after that so we were just an hour behind the whole day, which was not too big of a deal.\n\nLeft a stellar review for that company for sure.\n",

        "text": "Sorry for formatting, on mobile. LTL/FTP. \nRecently I've been learning more about at home waxing and trying different products to achieve the desired results for my underarms and legs. I finally decided it would be more economical to purchase a \"semi\" professional waxing system for my house. My husband and I did a little bit of research and found a small starter kit that we seemed to think would be practical for us (he's a trooper who is gracious enough to help me wax my legs). We went to a chain beauty supply store that is \"open to the public\", so a valid cosmetologist certificate isn't required for purchases. When we first walked in, we were asked if we needed any help with anything and I asked to be pointed in the direction of the waxing supplies. The employee was extremely nice and walked us to the supplies that we needed. I let her know that we were going to look for a few moments but that I may need some help shortly; she agreed and went back to stocking a shelf. I guess I should mention now that there were two employees working and my husband and I were the only customers in the store at this point. \nI found the starter kit that I was looking for and made sure I didn't need to purchase anything else for immediate use. While looking I noticed a similar wax warmer on sale for $3.99. I went to the next aisle and asked the first employee who greeted us if I could borrow her for a moment because I had some questions. I showed her the clearance warmer and asked if they had the wax to go with it because if I could buy everything individually and spend less, I'd prefer to do that. To her credit, she did look at the box and TRY to help, but she ended up having to call over the second employee. This is where things fell apart. The second girl comes over, we explain our dilemma and she immediately has a horrible attitude. I'll be ME, Nice employee will be #1 and horrible employee will be #2. \nME: So, if I can get out cheaper by buying the clearance warmer separately, I'd like to. Can you tell me if you carry everything to go with it? \n#1: I should be more educated on this, but I'm not, im sorry. Let me get #2 and I'll ask her. \n(I agree and #1 for #2 to come answer some questions. #1 starts explaining the situation and instead of answering, #2 just shrugs her shoulders and says she doesn't know.) \nNOW- #2 already has a horrid attitude and I begin to get a little miffed because a simple, yet polite, I'm not sure would've sufficed. Instead she wants to be a smart ass and tell me I should just look harder and if I don't see it, it isn't there. #2 then walks off leaving myself and her co-worker bewildered at her attitude. Again, we were the only customers in the store so it's not like I was taking #1 away from helping #2 do anything extremely important. About 1 minute later #2 yells loudly through the store that she needs #1's help and to please come to the back. #1 apologizes to me and tells me if I need anything else to let her know. \nThe waxing supplies are set up in the back of the store directly to the right of the \"stock room\". The stock room door was open and both employees had walked back there and left my husband and I in the store alone. I was prepared to just google what I needed to know, make our purchase and leave, but #2 had different ideas. As soon as she and her co-worker were in the back I heard obnoxious laughter and #2 saying, \"Don't you just HATE terrible customers who don't know anything?\"  At this point, I flipped my lid. I walked to the stock room door and told #2 that if I was such a terrible customer that the least she could do was come out and tell me that to my face and not \"quietly\" talk shit about me while I was in the store. I left both wax warmers I was looking at on the shelf and my husband and I left. \nI'm not sure what to do from here. Do I call the store on Tuesday and complain? Or do I go higher up? Or am I overreacting and being irrational? Sorry for the novel length post but her attitude annoyed me to no end. I could understand being in a bad mood if they were extremely busy and I was asking stupid questions, but I feel like I had legitimate questions and really needed help. ",

Apologies for any mistakes.\n\nJust the other day,I had an \"interesting\" interaction with a driver\\(referred to as CD=Crooked driver\\) of this Uber\\-ish company. 😆\n\nI had some quick shopping to do and didn't feel like driving myself so I decide to book a ride.I'd go to the mart in the cab,ask the driver to wait as I got what wanted reallll quick and return home in the same car.Done this a few times,never had any problems.What could go wrong?\n\nFor some reason,CD had trouble finding my location.He stopped right outside my street,but instead of calling and guiding him towards my home,I walked to him.I asked him and he had no problems with my plan.We got to the market without a hitch.\n\nI went into the store,got what I needed and returned in under 5 minutes, just to see that CD wasn't in the car!\n\nI started looking around and spotted him exiting the store.He said that the battery of his\n\nphone had died,he had forgotten to bring his charger, and the store was didn't have any for sale....\n\nI had no prior experience of such a scenario, but he told me that when we got to our destination,I could call the app's helpline and they'll tell us the fare.So I got back into the car,and we were on our way.\n\nWhen we were about to reach my home,I called the helpline and told the representative\\(NR=Nice Rep\\) about the situation and asked him about fare.After a short pause,NR told me that my fare was XX, but as I already had almost the same amount in credit,I didn't need to pay anything to the CD.I had put the call on speaker so CD could hear what I was told.\n\nHe parked the car at the spot he picked me up from\\(outside the street\\).Before i could tell him to drive just a little further,he started saying what I guess he had been planing to say since the call ended.\n\nCD;My phone died when we were at the market.That means the app stopped calculating halfway.So you should pay me XX.\n\nNow I was sure this was BS.No way the fare would have been as high as 2XX,as XX included the ride's \"Starting Fees\"\\(almost 30&amp;#37; of the total\\).Most people dont know that,as you dont get to see the fare's break down anywhere in the app,They mail it to you if you sign up using an email address,but most people usually sign up using their phone numbers. \n\nSo the driver was obviously trying to cheat me.I decided to play along.😆\n\nMe;Sure\\(Pay's the driver XX\\).\n\nThe driver;Thanks alot\\(all smiles\\).\n\nI got out of the car and waited for the driver to drive away before I walked to my home.As soon as I got back,I called the helpline again and got connected to the same rep again.I explained the situation to him,and he confirmed that yes,the driver was BSing me.He apologized and said that they will look into it ASAP.\n\nA couple hours later,I received an email from the company which apologized for the incident.As a compensation,they added the amount deducted from my credit AND the amount I paid to the driver back in my credit. 😆\n\nIt gets better!\n\nThis mail was followed by another seemingly unrelated promotion\\-offer mail,which offered the next 10 rides for 50&amp;#37; off!  😂\n\nI asked around,and no else i know received this offer. So it wasn't really unrelated.😉 \n\nTLDR;I out\\-smarted a crooked driver 😆",

        "text": "Okay, I need to rant.\n\nMy mom and I went shoe shopping today. Since we were planning to buy 2 pairs each, we picked out 6 pairs of shoes and tried them on. While we were discussing which pairs to buy, we noticed employees glaring at us. At first, we thought we must have been mistaken and let it go. Then, one female employee pushed me while she walked past me (I almost fell over) and loudly snorted. Confused and shocked, I stared at her. Then, another female employee yelled at us and told us to put those shoes back on the shelf. My mom explained that we were just trying to figure which ones to buy. She, too, snorted loudly and walked away. At this point, I told mom that we need to leave. She refused, saying that she really needed to buy new shoes and that we were almost done shopping anyway. \n\nFew minutes later, a male employee came, stood less than a feet behind my mom, and just stared at us without uttering a word. I lost my temper and angrily asked this man wtf he is doing. When he pretended he didn't understand my question, my mom asked for the manager. We explained the situation, and the manager reluctantly apologized. I insisted that we leave without buying anything, but my mom still wanted to buy 2 pairs. I was so angry that I actually left and waited in the parking lot while my mom purchased the shoes. \n\nI am planning to call the customer service department of this brand on Monday and make a formal complaint. \n\nI've worked in retail during college. I know the job can be emotionally draining. That being said, I will never understand these idiots who are hostile/rude/aggressive to random customers who are minding their own business. Wtf do they hope to achieve here? Are they too stupid to understand that they are literally being paid to provide support and encouragement for somebody's shopping experiences?? Do they have the IQ of a penguin or something? I can't believe I wasted my precious time on this god-forsaken store and I will never get that time back.",

I've asked hotel staff for things as silly as sewing needles and thread, safety pins, sometimes odd calls late at night to find diet coke or a number for a food delivery service.

        "text": "This is a tale of a poor retail experience, with a belligerent and obnoxious store owner, who thought he was above the law.\n\nThese events took place some time ago, and started when I noticed a couple of ties I’d bought were faulty. The fabric was bunching, which made the ties unpresentable and they were only a couple of weeks old. At $50 each, these weren’t expensive ties, but getting more than a couple of weeks wear seemed reasonable. A friend with a background in the clothing industry looked at them, and advised this was poor worksmenship.\n\nNot expecting this to be a big deal, I headed to the clothing store to return them. Or rather, attempted to. I explained the issue to the store owner, showed him the state of the ties, and emphasised I was happy to swap them and wasn’t necessarily looking for a refund. In my experience exchanging goods is a straightforward process, particularly when the purchase was recent and he problem evident. But not here. For clarity, this was a small chain of clothing stores with what appeared to be a single owner \\(who I was dealing with\\).\n\nImmediately this man became belligerent. He looked over the ties carefully and claimed nothing was wrong with them. I pointed out the obvious defects, to which he announced that ironing would sort it out. Like a cheap showman, he flourished an iron and went to work on the ties. When he finished, they were exactly the same.\n\nBy now I’d had enough, and told him I wasn’t interested in wasting any more time, and I’ll take a refund thank you very much. At this point, he lost it, and started screaming and gesticulating, claiming I was there to rip him off etc... I took the worthless ties and left.\n\nNormally, I would have forgotten about it, as a  hundred bucks isn’t worth wasting a lot of time over. However my employer was imploding due to the owners infighting, and I had more time than usual on my hands. And given this guy’s over the top attitude, I decided to file a complaint with the government consumer board.\n\nShortly there was a hearing. The owner appeared to defend himself. I told my tale and showed the state of the ties to the arbitrator. Predictably the owner was pissed and carried on like he was the aggrieved party. The arbitrator saw right through him, ruled in my favour, and he was instructed to refund my money.\n\nThe following day I showed up to collect my cash, and unsurprisingly, he refused to pay and suggested I go and reproduce with myself. \n\nSo, I contacted the board who told me to take the ‘judgement’ \\(I can’t remember the exact term\\) to the Sheriff’s department who would collect the money on my behalf. \n\nWeeks went by and I forgot all about it, when I was contacted by the board to come in and meet with the owner.\n\nIn the meeting room was the arbitrator, the owner, and his wife. Now, as this guy \\(the owner\\) sat at the table he was a partial shade of red, and a vein pulsing in his forehead was threatening to burst. I imagined he was pissed at being dragged in to actually pay up, but it was more than that. As I sat down he started to rant. He owned a chain of stores, and the sheriff paid a visit to his most exclusive one, located next to a luxury hotel. Because of the address, this location sold more expensive goods than his other stores. \n\nI assumed the sheriff just rocked up and demanded payment. But no, in a case where the party hadn’t paid up, the sheriff will seize goods to be auctioned for the debt. This is the fun part \\(for me anyway\\). Because goods at auction fetch much lower than retail prices, the sheriff has discretion as to how much he takes. Consequently, he decided a fair amount of goods to seize was an entire rack of expensive suits. From the description, this might have been ten thousand dollars worth of merchandise.\n\nNot only was the obnoxious owner out a tonne of stock, but a sheriff had barged into his flagship store, and created a ruckus, which wasn’t exactly great for his brand.\n\nIn the meeting the owner was almost hyperventilating at the arbitrator, who calmly explained that he had chosen to ignore his obligation and this was the consequence. His goods had yet to be auctioned, so he was given the option of paying now, and his suits would be returned to him. However, he would also have to pay additional fees for the sheriff’s time and effort. \n\nSpluttering objections, he took out a hundred bucks and flung it across the table at me. I smiled graciously, took the money, and wished him well.\n\nTL; DR: obnoxious store owner ripped me off by refusing to refund faulty goods. After also refusing to pay up after a consumer judgement against him, sheriff seizes a tonne of stock and he is forced to pay up, or be out of pocket big time after his goods are auctioned for pennies on the dollar.",

        "text": "Some background: I've usually used [big moving equipment rental company] in the past for my occasional truck needs and more-frequent car/motorcycle trailer rentals. 9 times out of 10, I'll book equipment showing as available at a location near me, and then the day before I pick it up they text me and tell me I need to go an extra 45 minutes to an hour to get it. I've usually put up with it, but today was the last straw for me.\n\nI need to move out of my dorm and back to my home roughly three hours away. I booked a 10' truck in the town that my school is in on Tuesday, and it showed as plenty available in the immediate (5 mile) vicinity. Everything was fine until this morning, when they suddenly had the nerve to text me that I've been moved, without my consent, to a location almost an hour away. \n\nSeeing as I'm operating on a tight moveout schedule and needed the truck I booked in the location I booked when I booked it, which is supposedly guaranteed by them, I immediately called their customer service line. I had to wait 15 minutes after connecting just to talk to someone, who then transferred me to scheduling where a passive-aggressive agent essentially yelled at me for calmly, but firmly, stating that I was not happy with this and that it wouldn't work. Apparently, it's unreasonable to not be able to drop everything and go an hour away when you were planning on needing a five-minute ride to the location you picked. Screw them, whatever, I cancelled the reservation.\n\nContrast with this now. In need of a truck still to move myself out, I went and looked at other sites, namely [affordable other moving equipment and car rental company]. I found a similar (even slightly bigger) truck 25 minutes away, and immediately booked it. After booking, I saw they have a police/fire/EMS discount (I'm an EMT) so I called customer service to see if I could get it applied to my reservation (with the 18-24 driver fee, the price was initially much higher than first company's but I need the truck). Immediately got connected with an agent, who went in and applied the code for me, and now my reservation at [second, affordable moving equipment and car rental company] is cheaper than it even was at [first, evil, heartless moving company].\n\nTL;DR By not changing my location to an hour away at the last minute, and by being friendly and applying a discount code retroactively to my reservation, [second, affordable moving equipment and car rental company] put [first, evil, heartless moving company] to complete and utter shame.\n\nEdit: Went in just now and looked at my reservation, and they bumped me up to an even bigger truck. I love this company.",

We have a website where we can see all these restaurants and their menus so that we can order and then review them later on. I hate cooking so I order A LOT of food.\n\nA few days ago I was craving cookies and decided to order a dozen from my fav restaurant (I order from them almost every week but they're actually a normal restaurant that sells cookies on the side). It was late at night (22:00 or so) so I expected the delivery to take some time as they probably didn't have fresh cookies by then. 20 mins after ordering I was called by the restaurant, they apologized to me for being late but they wanted a fresh batch to deliver and told me that they would deliver the cookies to me in 7 mins max. I said thank you and hung up. I had to wait for another 20 mins after the call to actually receive my order but that wasn't a big deal so I just paid and got my food.\n\nWhen I opened the package, however, I saw that the cookies were too hot when they packed them together so they kinda just fused into each other, forming 3 big, fat cookie-tablet-things (consisting 4 cookies each) instead of 12 normal sized cookies.\n\nI finally found the time to review them today, writing a negative but fair review, recounting the events and how it could have been avoided. Less than an hour later I got a call from the restaurant: they were very sorry for my experience and wanted to compensate for it by sending me another dozen.\n\nSo I'm now eating my properly cooled off delicious cookies from my favorite restaurant and I could not be happier. I just wanted to share!\n\nUpdate: I contacted the website and told them about the restaurant. They were happy to help me get my review down, but told me that it'd take a while as it was weekend. Fingers crossed it happens soon!",

        "text": "This happened almost 30 years ago, but I got a flash back the other day when visiting my home town and walking past the former location of this candy store.\n\nThe store was owned and operated by a, at least from the perspective of an 8 year old, ancient lady. She was probably somewhere between 60 and 120. She sold stuff like candy, \"luxurious\" coffe and small edible gift things. I used to go to the store with my dad on saturdays, and old lady was always super friendly, offering free samples of new kinds of chocolate or fudge or whatever and smiling and laughing and being overall nice to us kids.\n\nAs we got a little older, me and my friends would no longer have to be escorted by our parents when going to spend our weekly allowance on candy. We quickly discovered that friendly old lady wasn't as friendly when our parents weren't around. In fact, she was a bit nasty. She never said hello to any of us and she never smiled, she once grabbed my wallet out of my hand to see if I had any bills when trying to pay with coins and all of a sudden she had zero patience with us when we were deciding what to buy, like:\n\n\nMe: 'I'll have one of those, one of those, two of those, and...-\"  \nHer: \"That's enough, that'll be X. Come back some other time!\"  \nEven if I was the only person in the store. She simply didn't like kids, but she really liked to suck up to the parents.\n\nOf course we were all too wimpy and well mannered to tell her to fuck off, but we did tell our parents about her behavior. At some point after that my dad told me to go inside and buy some candy while he was hanging around just outside the store. The store was very small, so he'd hear any conversation inside. As expected, on me asking to add a few things to my \"order\", old lady angrily tells me that she doesn't have time for my crap or something of that nature. Dad enters, and the conversation that follows is something like:  \n\n\nDad: \"What's the problem? My son wants to buy some additional candies.\"  \nHer: \"Errrr, of course, I'm just...\"  \nDad: \"So you're acting friendly when adults are around but you're really treating our kids like this? You don't think they tell us? There are plenty of nasty words for people like you, you know.\"  \nShe doesn't respond.\n\nI remember feeling mostly awkward at the time, but we just paid and left and I remember my dad taking me there a couple of times during the coming year or two just to make her uncomfortable.\n\nI have a few other childhood memories of being treated poorly as a customer, but this is the only one where some minor kind of justice was served.",

I'm 20 and have worked in retail and am currently working in a local fast food restaurant and therefore i know how annoying complaining customers can be, which also means that i rarely complain because i don't want to be that kind of customer.\n\nTL:DR at bottom\n\nThe story begins when i had to send my laptop to get repaired at the shop i bought it from. It was only 6 months old before the hard drive just died out of nowhere. \n\nThe repair was supposed to take 2-3 weeks, which in my opinion means 2 weeks is the goal and 3 weeks is worst case scenario, well.. I got a clear from the shop about 1 week in that it had arrived, and the day after that the hard drive had been replaced and it would be shipped back. \n\nI waited for 2 more weeks before i decided to call the costumer support since it still hadn't arrived and was told that they'd send a message to the main store and was told that they'd call me in the next 24 hours.\n\nWhen that doesn't happen i call again and get told that the message was read but discarded, which shouldn't happen unless they had fulfilled the request in the message.\n\nI was then told that they'd send a message both to the store and to the manager of the store and that i should be expecting a call that same day, but again nothing.\n\nI then decided to go to the store, which i admittedly should have done a long time ago, and ask where my laptop was. \n\nI told them how i'd been promised calls but no one called at all and at this point i had been waiting a month for any response, and that i would like some kind of compensation for it since i felt that i'd been treated very poorly by the store.\n\nThe dude checks up and sees that it had actually arrived at the store weeks earlier, and was written in as recieved by an employee, but wasn't in their system nor in their storage so i had to get the money back, on top of the money he wanted to give me about 20$ in compensation, which was money i had negotiated down with the employee i originally bought the laptop from, but if the laptop i found had better specs than the previous i wouldn't even get the money off.\n\nNow again i am very bad at complaining and i don't like to make a fuss, at this point my heart is already racing because of the original complaint so i just say alright and i find a salesman to help me find a new laptop.\n\nAfter looking at some, he found a couple that was about 200-400$ more expensive than the one i had, and i wasn't about to dump that much money on top. Lucky for me, the salesman was a little more understanding with what i had been through, and ended up offering me a trade, so i'd get the laptop that was 400$ more but for no additional cost which i was very happy about.\n\nIn the end i was happy with the service from the salesman, and very happy about the new laptop, but also very disappointed with what i had to go through before something was done\n\nTL:DR\nComputer needs repair but sits in delivery for a month\nI get ignored by several messages to costumer support\nCustomer support unhelpful with compensation\nGood guy salesman helps me out in the end.",

At the time, he and I both worked from home and were such home-bodies that the only time we weren’t together was during this 90-minute time period on Friday mornings. \n\nThis specific ill-fated morning started out the same. He ordered the same thing he had the week before when the young, very overweight woman working the drive-thru looked at him and started freaking out. \n\n“You tried to kidnap me yesterday!”\n\nMy husband was very obviously confused, denied knowing what she was talking about, and continued to wait for his order. She made a huge commotion about how it was undoubtedly my husband who tried to lure her into his black car the day before in the parking lot just outside. My husband was understandably upset because where he is from, you are guilty until proven innocent. The police often beat the confession out of you, He just stood there confused as to what was going on. \n\nWhen his food was ready, he and his baffled friends went outside to eat and talk. About five minutes later, the police pull up and begin questioning my terrified husband as he wondered what I would do when he got deported for this. \n\n“Where were you yesterday?”\n\n“At home with my wife.”\n\n“Come on, just tell the truth. Where were you?”\n\n“At home, on the other side of the city, with my wife. I never left the house.”\n\n“What type of car do you drive?”\n\n“That silver one over there.”\n\n“Let me see your license and registration.”\n\n“What are you gentlemen doing here this morning?”\n\nThe police continued to question him and his friends, but slowly began to realize that my husband did not in fact try to kidnap anyone the day before. The car didn’t match the description and all she had described him as was a dark-skinned man with an accent. Once he was cleared, no apologies from the coffee place were to be had. I posted a review in hopes of someone from the Canadian coffee place would acknowledge that that was pretty crappy and apologize. Instead, the review was deleted.",

Off white. \n\nI almost never send food back but if I drank that I’d have stomach cramps and worse for hours. \n\nI say: “I’m so sorry but I can’t drink this, it has milk in it.” \n\nThe young woman says assertively: “It’s not milk.”\n\nWe stare at each other for several long seconds while my brain experiences a zen moment of no thoughts other than “huuuuhh?” \n\nEventually she says: “It’s cream!” \n\nI smile a 😬 smile and say “I’m sorry I can’t drink that either.” \n\nShe huffs and goes back to make me a black coffee. \n\nTL;DR Black coffees don’t contain milk OR cream.

        "text": "So a bit of background, I’ve been a chef for 4 years and have worked both FOH and BOH since I was 13 (now 21). \nI’m also allergic to cos lettuce (I know it’s weird but my body is stupid) no other lettuce but cos and baby cos. I break out into hives up my arms if I touch it and if I eat it my throat feels like it’s on fire. At work I either get someone else to grab it or I use gloves and tongs to be safe. \n\nSo story, I went to a local pub for lunch and wanted the burger but asked the server to omit the lettuce making sure to tell her I was allergic. No problem. \n\nFood comes out and I see it has a huge ass chunk of cos lettuce on top. BS will be Bitchy Server and Me will be me (obvs) \n\nMe: sorry I said no lettuce. I’m allergic and can’t have this \n\nBS: allergic to lettuce? That’s a new one. You didn’t tell me you were allergic \nlike wtf Yes I did, like not even 10 minutes ago, it’s not new information \n\nMe: yeah I did, I made sure I did. Could I just get a new burger please, I can’t eat what the lettuce has touched. \n\nNow working in a kitchen you learn little tricks, so to make sure they made me a new burger and didn’t just take the lettuce off I smeared a little sauce on the top of the bun. Low and behold not even 2 minutes later my burger comes out, no lettuce but still with a sauce smear on the bun. \n\nMe: hi sorry again but I know this is still the old burger, I need a new one. I can eat this as it’s been contaminated by the lettuce\n\nBS: starting to look real fed up No it’s not, it’s a new one I watched the kitchen make it \n\nMe: no they didn’t, this is a real allergy and I need a new burger please. \n\nBS: It’s a new burger. You’ll be fine. \nYes thats correct. She said “you’ll be fine”\n\nMe: well ya see here, and explained my sauce on bun trick\n\nBS: now red in the face oh the chefs must’ve made a mistake I’ll get onto it. \n\nLike don’t you dare mate, I know for a fact that if you say someone’s got an allergy, chefs will go to new length to make sure their food is safe. You didn’t tell them it was an allergy and now you look like a tool. But it’s easy for servers to blame the kitchen. \n\nSo I finally get my new burger, by this stage my friend has finished his meal and is stealing my chips. \nBut I get that mistakes happen but don’t argue with me about A. Not telling you about my allergy and B. If a new meal was made. You could seriously hurt someone by not taking this shit seriously. \nIt’s a good thing we don’t tip in Australia cos she would’ve gotten jack shit. ",

        "text": "There are a lot of coffee shops near my job.  I mix up where I go depending on what I feel like for breakfast.  One in particular used to have the most incredible toasted cheese sandwiches – basic white bread and pre-sliced plastic wrapped cheese with some other options.  Perfection.  Not like these overly fancy sour dough ones where the cheese is never gooey and the bread is always too thick .  So I’d go there reasonably often and the staff knew my name.  \n\n\nI go there one day and a staff member who knows me takes my order and I go to wait nearby.  He doesn’t ask for my name, but this is not unusual at this point.  I’m waiting and the barista is calling out a name, let’s say Stacey, and no one is answering him.  He’s starts calling out the coffee type as well as the name, “Stacey, Soy flat white???” after a few attempts I let him know that while yes, that is my coffee order, my name isn’t Stacey.  He asks my name (for the sake of this story we’ll say it’s Petula, but suffice to say my name is very very different to the name they called out.  It’s not like they got Hannah and Anna confused) and realises there aren’t any orders for my real name and we surmise that the guy at the register got my name wrong.  It was a couple of awkward minutes, and while the barista had seemed annoyed at first we got it sorted out with minimal issues.\n\n\nThen my toastie is ready.  \n\n\nI’m playing on my phone waiting on it a bit zoned out and don’t hear the repeated calls of Stacey.  Then out of nowhere there a hand waving a brown paper bag in front of my phone centimetres from my face, and the guy who took my order initially is saying “Stacey!! This is your order!” with a very rude and irritated tone.  I startled back and say “um, my name is Petula” with a wide-eyed look, while a woman next to me (who clearly thinks he’s been a bit inappropriate too) says to him “Yeah, she just did this with the coffee” \n\n\nThe café worker is mortified, apologises profusely and I take my toastie without further incident.  But frankly, the whole experience was super uncomfortable and I just didn’t want to go back there.  Over 6 months later I’m thinking about breakfast and mourning the loss of those incredible toasted sandwiches when I realise the only thing stopping me from going and getting one is my own insane anxiety issues.  I gear myself up to return, reassuring myself the whole time that they won’t even remember me because it’s been soooo long.\n\n\nArrive and the guy taking my order is the same guy who mistakenly wrote me down as Stacey the last time I was there.  I order and he says “Petula, right?” I’m a bit taken aback and tell him I’m surprised he remembered, and he tells me there’s no way he could forget, he was so embarrassed and proceeded to apologies again and thank me repeatedly for coming back and giving them another chance.  Frankly, that interaction was about as awkward and anxiety inducing as it could have possibly been, but at least I’d ripped off the bandaid and could have those delicious toasties again! But alas, they’ve changed their toasties significantly and they are no longer the basic bitch delicious ones I remember.  Add to that a burnt coffee, and I never did end up going back there again.  These days when I walk past it I cross the road because I’m worried about catching that guys eye through the store window because I’m terrified that, at this point, he’s never going to forget me! ",

I physically can’t speak sometimes, and that’s what happened today.\n\nSo, we went to an endless soup, salad, and breadsticks place because my boyfriend had a gift card from his graduation. I ended up ordering this really good soup that had kale and sausage in it. However, I knew that I would be asked if I wanted cheese on my soup.\n\n“Tell me when to stop” she said and started grinding away on the big cheese block. It had to have been an unused block.\n\nLittle did she know that the entire block was going to be in my bowl of soup.\n\nShe kept going at the cheese, cranking the handle and I was just sitting there, watching in horror as my bowl was getting filled to the edge with the cheese, and I was opening my mouth to try and get some sort of noise out to tell her “I DONT WANT THIS MUCH CHEESE” but I couldn’t. My boyfriend was watching me, seeming amused.\n\nI finally opened my mouth to say “thanks, that’s enough” but it was already too late. The block of cheese was already in my bowl.\n\n“If you want, I can get a second block of cheese from the back, it’s okay-“\n\n“NO THANK YOU I’M FINE HAHA” I blurted out. She smiled and left the table. And there it was, a pile of cheese on my soup. It wasn’t even in my soup anymore. It was ON IT.\n\nBut damn, it tasted good.\n\nThe waitress was really nice, though, and funny, so I hope that her having to put and entire block of cheese in my soup wasn’t too much of a hassle. She gave us like, 10 mint chocolate pieces at the end of our meal. We ended up tipping her 50% because we only had a $10 bill and we don’t normally have cash, so I hope it was okay.\n\nTL:DR- due to my anxiety, I made a waitress put an entire block of cheese into my soup",

        "text": "TLDR at the end. \n\tSo I was writing a comment on another subreddit and I remembered a story which happened to me last year. I was going to the same nail studio which I liked but one of the people who I became quite close at that time kept raving about what an awesome nail technician her mother is. I decided to give it a try and had an appointment with her. What I initially wanted was nude nails with one having holographic powder rubbed in, but she said that holographic nails are a \"dead trend, no one's been doing them for three years or so\". I was genuinely confused but went on with that and chose a blue cat's eye design with one nail having a texture close to lizard skin. She said it was fine and started working. I immediately regretted my decision when she started applying the base coat without evening it out and because of that the black gel and the cat's eye gel applied in ripples. I was looking at her work in confusion all while she kept on bragging about the courses she took, how experienced and popular she is and how she believes that all the salons where you have to book an appointment two or three weeks prior are just pretending to have a lot of clients. Uhhh, okay. Then she applies matte top coat and dries it in a lamp. Then she looks at my fingers and asks,  \"why is the top coat not matte?\", to which I had to politely tell her that maybe she should rub it with alcohol to make it matte. She did so and I realized she wasn't exactly understanding what she was doing. She then tried to create the lizard skin texture by plopping a couple drops of top coat on my nails. She looks at them and says, \"let's add some bling!\", at this point I already don't care. So she applies some silvery polish and says it's done. The nails were a mess. Since she was my friend's mom, I couldn't tell her what I thought and she only charged me $3, but then I just went back to the salon and never returned to her again. However, when her daughter and I stopped being friends half a year later, she told me I owed her $25 for that crappy manicure, to which I just blocked her number. \n\n\tTLDR: friend's mom claimed to be a professional nail technician, but turned out to be bragging and inexperienced.

This doesn't sound like an issue, but whenever I go into a store, people make me go find my parents and stay within sight of them. This is very annoying for me, because I am perfectly capable of finding my way around a store/mall. \n\nWhen I was 12 at a department store, I had to stay within sight of my mom even though 90&amp;#37; of the store was racks that people could easily look over. I was in the toy aisle, maybe twenty feet away from my mom. A few other stores have done this, but mostly people allow me to wander unsupervised. Today, however, I had no such luck. \n\nI was at a mall yesterday with friends. We're all about the same age, although they were a few months younger. We went into multiple stores and there were no problems. Today, I went back with my mom and grandma. They were at a random store \\(not part of the story\\) while I went to a collectibles store. I was browsing for a few minutes and one employee who helped me before \\(he was cool, he had the sword and shield from Z\\*\\*\\*\\* on his back and a wizard staff\\) didn't say anything. Another employee who I hadn't seen before came up to me while I was looking through their movies/TV section. The conversation I had was as follows the the best of my knowledge. \\(I'm me and the employee is E\\)\n\nE: excuse me, are you here alone?\n\nMe: \\(trying to sound as old and condescending as possible by phrasing everything as a question\\) yes?\n\nE: are you here with your parents?\n\nMe: yes?\n\nE: Are they nearby?\n\nMe: no?\n\nE: Do you know where they are?\n\nMe: Yes?\n\nE: Well, the mall is big and people tend to get lost in it, so you have to be 16 to wander off alone. \n\nMe: \\(Hating that I wasn't born 6 or so months sooner\\) O\\-okay. \n\nE: Do you have a cell phone?\n\nMe: Yes? \n\nE: Well, why don't you call them and see where they are, but we can't have people walking around like this, okay?\n\nMe: k\n\nI found my mom and then went to some other stores without a problem. It's not a huge thing and I totally get why they have to do that, but I still hate it. At least my young face will be a good thing later in life. \n\nSidenote: I've biked to this mall and back before without a problem. It's designed so there's two floors and you go in a straight line. You can even see the other floor. \n\nTL;DR: I have a young face and have to be supervised in stores sometimes because I look 12 max. ",

        "text": "So, my boyfriend and I went to visit his grandmother in her hometown, about an hour and a half away from where we live. We had been working all day on the day in question, so we were already very tired and had little patience for any stupidity...or dumbassery...anywhoo, let’s begin.\n\nBF and I stopped at the local Dollar General store to buy travel toothbrushes and a couple of other necessities that we would need for our stay at his grandmother’s house. We were in there for about 20 minutes before we headed to the checkout line with our items. Upon arriving at the checkout area, the cashier running the register announced that the store would be closing in about 10 minutes or so; we get in live behind this young woman (who we will call “SW” for “Seriously Woman?!?!??”) who is purchasing various clothing items. At first, she’s an okay kind of person, but that didn’t last long...\n\nImmediately after the cashier started ringing up all her items, SW starts asking questions about a few of her items that are missing prices, to which the cashier has one of her coworkers go look for similar items and another coworker going through their product lookup system. SW watches as the cashier rings up the rest of her items that are priced, but stops her halfway; she tells the cashier that the clothes cost too much and void out specific items. The cashier obliges and starts to void out the items that SW told her to. By this time, the two coworkers had found the prices for the rest of SW’s items. Here is where it gets to the “fun” part.\n\nSW decides to ask for the price of EVERY ITEM INDEPENDENTLY. By the time, the store is officially closed, but the line of customers behind us was about 10 people long. It’s been about 10 minutes since we joined the line. The cashier becomes visibly irritated, but does her job and tells SW the prices as she holds the items up. SW decides that the prices of most of the items are too high and tells the cashier to put them back. The cashier puts them in a return cart. SW then decides that she needs to complain about the prices being too high for the CLEARANCE items that she got. I glance at my boyfriend and give him the slightly widened eyes of the “seriously?!?!?!” look. He grimaces and looks down to hide his expression from SW. \n\nSW had started becoming pushy, aggressive, and indecisive about what she did and didn’t want, so the cashier got on the intercom and asked for a manager to come deal with SW. She had clearly had enough, her expression said it all. She was pissed! A manager came up and SW did the same BS that she did before. The manager took at and delivered on it, but that wasn’t enough for SW. She wanted price changes, discounts, and whatever the eff else. The manger tells her that she can’t give her discounts because there’s no damage to the items and because some of them are already on clearance. This argument goes on for about 40 minutes with SW wanting to have items put back to wanting them...40 MINUTES. My boyfriend and I are exchanging looks with other customers by now...we were all pretty much boiling with annoyance at SW. \n\nSW FINALLY makes her purchase and leaves. My boyfriend and I check out and are let out of the door by an employee (the doors were locked because it was past closing time). We start walking to BF’s car, talking about SW, when all of a sudden...\n\nSW rushes past us, back toward the store. She goes to the door a bangs on the door, asking to exchange something. As we watched, she became even more pushy and aggressive. She kept banging on the door, demanding to be let in. While we were laughing about it, we were also feeling even more annoyed and sorry for the employees (who didn’t let her in and told her to gtfo). \n\nWe drove away while she was still standing there, as if they were going to let her back in there...no, bye Felicia!",

We sit down and the server brings us our drinks and takes our order before sitting at the center table and joining in on the conversation. \n\nNow, you can see into the kitchen from the dining area. At one point, a woman got up from the table, walked into the kitchen and began talking to the cook who was plating my family's lunch. As she was leaving, she reached down and took a few fries off one of the plates, before taking her seat.\n\nThe cook called the server who got back up, gathered food, and brought it out to us, setting the snacked on plate in front of me. Before I could say something, the server turned her back and sat back down at the table, didn't ask if we needed refills (we did), or if we needed anything else. Prom was apparently coming up and she needed tell these people how big of a slut someone at her school was. \n\nMy parents ate their food but I was too put off. When we left, I took my plate and walked up to the center table and put it in front of the woman, said \"Here, in case you wanted the rest of it,\" and walked out the door. \n\nWe left with the exact change for the meal on the table, and to this day, it's the only time I have not tipped my waitstaff.

Just stared her the fuck out while she looked confused, as though she didn't have a clue that what she had done was extremely rude. When she realised that I wasn't about to move a muscle until she backed the fuck up she slowly collected her shit and walked back to the line, complaining all the while about me being \"rude to my elders\". I gave her the biggest, shit eating grin I could muster before turning back, apologising to the cashier for the delay and paying for my stuff.\n\nEdit: Sorry, I should have explained further.

This puts me right behind **\"leaning lady\"**, at about ten or eleven from actually getting to pay - and the person who's paying is currently having \"I don't know how to use a gift card\" problems - but that's not the point of this story.\n\nAnd by \"butthurt\" I mean this guy keeps grumbling impatient unhelpful stuff like, \"rurrh, I can't believe they only got one cashier open at this time on a Saturday morning\" or \"it's just a gift card\" or \"you were in line for the last five minutes and NOW you realize you forgot something?\"\n\nWithin a few moments as a couple more customers have been taken care of, another cashier enters the central ring and yells, \"Taking the next person in line\".\n\nThe **\"leaning woman\"** - who is now six or seven in line - happened to have \"leaned out\" at just the right time to run over and get taken by that cashier.\n\nAs soon as that happens, **Mr. Grumbling OldGuy** slams his hand on the counter and before anything else can happen, **the previously-quiet lady** in front of him says loudly, \n\n\"My word!  She just did that!  Ran out in front of the five other people waiting to pay to get herself checked out!  Did you see that?  Can you believe she actually just actually did that?\"\n\nTwo things happened in the space of the next two heartbeats:\n\n1 - The line jumping customer realized she was in the wrong and tried to make her transaction take as quickly as possible while also hiding her face by turning her back to the rest of the side of the cashiers' stand we were all on\n\n2 - **Mr. Grumpy McGrumperson** started -laughing- as he (I fervently hope) realized how irritating he'd been with his complaints and that he wasn't the only person being inconvenienced\n\nSo here's to you, **Mz. \"She Just Actually Did That\"**, for saying what we were all thinking, and brightening our day for a few short moments.",

So I just sorta stood there because i was so confused and there was just this awkward silence between us before she turned to me and said “now what would you like?”\n\nI just shook my confusion and placed my order. Still dont know what was going on there if she was having a joke or something but still. Was pretty funny looking back.",

        "text": "I didn't get my driver's license until I was around 22 or 23. I had some fears regarding driving, so it took me a while to work up the courage. So in the meantime, I took the bus to school. I live in a small town surrounded by other small towns, so we only have one bus system and you pretty much have to use whatever route they offer. Often this meant I had to leave an hour early to catch the bus that would take me to the bus station, where I would wait for a half hour before catching the bus that would take me to school.\n\nWell, one of the bus drivers was a man who looked exactly like Santa Claus. I was new to switching buses, so I was concerned about having to pay twice when you only pay once per route. When we arrived at the bus station, I asked him if I needed some kind of card \\(they offered one\\-time only cards that you show to the bus driver of your next bus\\) to prove I'd already paid on another bus.\n\nHe said, \"No, you don't need one. Just tell them Santa Claus said it was okay. Everyone calls me that.\" So I smiled and said okay and headed into the bus station to wait. Still, I was concerned. I didn't have any more cash, so if I couldn't get on that next bus, I couldn't get to school. So, I went to the office and asked if I needed one of those cards because the bus driver wouldn't give me one.\n\nWell, this opened a can of worms. For one thing, I absolutely needed that card. Fortunately, they had some and gave me one. But the manager \\(who was black\\-\\- this is relevant\\) wanted to know what bus driver told me that. The following is the interaction between me \\(Me\\) and the manager \\(M\\):\n\n&gt;ME: I don't want to get anyone in trouble.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;M: Oh, they're in trouble, all right.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Err...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;M: What did he look like?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me \\(not wanting to say because then it would be a dead give away\\): Um, well...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;M \\(kind of knowingly\\): Was he black? \\(As though I didn't want to point out he was black because the manager was black, which is a thing some people do but was definitely not the case here.\\)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: No, he wasn't. I\\-\\- I need to go wait for my bus.\n\nAt this, they let me go. I can only imagine they had some sort of meeting because the next time I had Santa as my bus driver, he made sure I had a card. I don't know if he ever knew that I was the one who sort of got him in trouble, but I hope he at least finds solace in the fact that no one said, \"It was the guy who said to call him Santa Claus!\" After all, I ain't no snitch.\n\nEDIT: If this happened today, I'd probably tell the manager who gave me the wrong information. But back then I was still working in retail and kind of had this mentality that I didn't want to cause any service worker unnecessary trouble. This probably counted as necessary, but I didn't think so at the time. I felt like I would be responsible for him getting in trouble, even though he was in the wrong. ",

The clerk tells her she doesn't have the means to hold anything that long and she can't just give her the product because she has no proof the items didn't make it home with her. As someone who works in retail it makes sense to me. \n\nThen we get the obligatory I spend a lot of money here, and this gem \"I bought this product on the 8th why don't you still have it.\" And that she's going to call cooperate office. When the customer turns to leave. The clerk tells her \"I hope you have a nice day\". The customer turns around to tell her No it's been a shitty day I hope you have a shitty day too\". \n\nAs she's walking out I told her I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as you but I'm not sure if she heard me. \n\nI figure it was probably a scam because who in their right mind waits 10 days to go pick up an item they forgot at the store?

After the appointment I paid for the parking and went to wait for my car. There were at least a dozen valets standing around talking to one another and doing nothing at the curb and another couple talking in the valet's lot. I waited about 10 minutes while my toddler continued to get more and more restless. I went to the window to ask about the wait and was told my car would be driven around shortly. \n\n15 minutes after I paid for my parking, all the while watching the valets standing there talking, one finally goes to get my car. He then pulls up to the other valets in the parking lot, rolls down the window, and starts talking to them. At this point I'm furious, which is only fueled by my daughter's frustrated wails. Finally the guy pulls up with my car. \n\nAt the beginning of the ordeal I'd held a couple of ones in my hand for a tip, but then switched it out for a $5. Guy pulls up in my car, opened the door and stands there waiting, while I'm clearly holding what would have been his tip. I give him a big smile, say thanks, proceed to put the money back in my purse and get in the driver's seat (husband put daughter in car). \n\nI would have had no problem waiting and tipping if they had been super busy, but you waste my time chatting to your coworkers right in front of me?

The store this is has those 1/3/5 dollar bins. Its stack so all the $1 things are on top, $3 things in the middle and the $5 things oon the bottom. \n\nI find a cheapo utility thing on the top in the 1 dollar bin. \"Cool\" i think. I continue getting everything else i need. I go to the checkout. As i walk up the cashier is talking to get coworker. Normally this would be rude but it was 30 minutes into the suite being open, and since i work retail i usually don't mind this. This cashier shoots me the why are you here look. \n\nShe starts scanning and the utility thing comes up to $5. \n\nM for me,  C for cashier, F for floor associate. \n\nM: thats weird. I found that in the $1 bin. \n\nC: said angrily \"well its not its $5.\"\n\nM: since she's already being a hassle. I ask \"can you have someone check I swear its in the top bin. I can even go back take a picture or video to prove it.\" \n\nC: they're GOING to tell YOU the same thing. \n\nM: its honestly not that hard to do i price check, i do it all the time for xxxxxxxx company.\n\nC: finally asks her coworker, while rolling her eyes \"will you just check for this chick\"\n\nF: in a I'm not awake yet tone \"sure ill be right back\"\n\nC: she repeats \"she's GOING to tell YOU the same thing. \"\n\nM: we will see.\n\nF: gets back and tells C \"they are in the $1 bin,  the sick tream stocked them wrong\"\n\nC: fine whatever. \n\nM: thank you\n\nShe finishes ringing me up. \n\nHonestly if she didn't have attitude i would have made them price check. But it's part of the job. Most importantly if something is mislabeled you can't completely blame the customer. Since this want a company i shop at all the time, i honestly didn't know it had been stocked wrong. The stocker messed up and it should be in favor of the customer. \n\nOnly time I've ever requested the price check. I know how annoying customers like this are. It was the first stop of my errands and had gotten there a couple of minutes after they opened. This happens where i work all the time we always go with what the customer is seeing. For example, an old sign, wrong clearance price, or a wrong fully stocked item(which definitely happens)\n\n",

Whats in that?\nSW: explains that its nail polish remover \nPL: well whats in it?? Im pregnant, im just worried about the chemicals. \n\nFair enough i guess\n\nPL: is that the only nail polish remover you have?\nSW: yes, we always use this\nPL: well...i just wish you told me you were going to use it\n\nPL's mom is also there and says that her daughter is pregnant and is concerned about the chemicals in the nail polish remover\n\nShe basically keeps complaining and saying shes not trying to make a big deal about it, even though she is making a big deal about it, and was very upset that SW didn't tell her she was going to use the nail polish remover. \n\nThen she says that she is done, she just wants to leave, and that she should have just brought her own nail polish remover (which is i guess safe for when you're pregnant) even though she said that she wanted them to just be done with her nails, when i was leaving she was still distressed looking but still getting her nails done.\n\nI genuinely felt bad for the workers, I've known these people since i was a kid, they didn't really do anything, they just tried to do something that PL wanted/ tried to \"fix\" the situation, honestly if she wanted her nails done using the right nail polish remover/ nail polish maybe she should have gone to a better salon",

Speaking is fine when it is quiet but they need to learn to help the customer first and then continue.\n\nThen at the till point they were also talking to one another because it was a slow time ( it fine with me) but I had to do the \"excuse me\" just to get the till lady to notice that I am there and want to pay for my meal.\n\nTL/DR Store workers speaking making it difficult for the customer to be quick and properly get their order in or even pay for their meal.",

        "text": "A couple years ago, our minivan started leaking when it rained. Water would come in under the dash. We took it to our repair place several times, and they checked several things and couldn’t figure it out. We live in a humid, rainy place so we were getting concerned, we didn’t need mold growing in our van. Finally, they said it was probably the seal on the windshield, so I made an appointment at a windshield replacement place.\n\nWhen we got there, I showed the guy what was going on, and he immediately told me that it wasn’t the windshield and showed me what the problem was, a strip of plastic that rested on the windshield. I got that replaced and it fixed the problem. I was surprised and thankful that they didn’t just replace the windshield and charge me for it, but were honest enough to tell the truth about what the issue was. I was a woman with a carload of kids, a lot of people would have taken advantage of my obvious ignorance of the issue. They will definitely be our first choice if we ever need to replace a window for real.",

        "text": "Last night, after my closing shift at my retail job, my mother and I decided to swing by a fast food place that serves certain breakfast items all day. \n\nWe walk in and some chairs are on the tables so we ask if they're closing, because if so we will just get to go. They insist we have plenty of time to eat in.\n\nI order breakfast, because I love it, but I know it takes them a while to make so I apologize in advanced, they say it's fine.\n\nWe get our food, one of the workers had to bring my hashbrown to the table because it took longer than the rest of my food, and I say thank you, my mother says \"Oh man, that looks good, I kinda wish I got one, too\" and we go on eating.\n\nNot even a minute later the same worker walks up, and sets another hashbrown down on our tray for my mom. It's such a small gesture, but it meant a lot and we really appreciated it.\n\nAs we left we were sure to say thank you one more time, honestly amazing service. ",

He crouched down by the bike, and within seconds spotted the problem, and followed up with me asking who had assembled the bike, because they did it wrong.\n\n When I told him my father did it, he told me I should not pay for him to do it, and instead have my dad fix the problem. He could very well told me I'd need an expensive fix, like a new wheel, but instead he was honest. \n\n\nHe gained a customer for many years to come! (And I am never letting dad do anything major to my bike again )",

        "text": "So I was grocery shopping the other night at a 24 hour big box store, you probably know which one. \n\nSo I was in line after grabbing some frozen food because I was dealing with a stressful situation and hadn't eaten in 12+ hours. So I was hangry but just patiently waited my turn.\n\nStore only had one lane open but there was only one other person in front of me and she was finishing up her transaction. \n\nIt probably would have gone by faster if the employee ringing her up wasn't having a loud, personal phone argument as she's supposed to be working. She took forever to finish the lady's transaction because she and another employee (who I assume are either relatives or roommates, idk) were having a loud argument about what they were going to eat when they got home, and whoever they were talking to on the phone kept calling back. \n\nThe lady in front of me gets her things after the cashier who is half-assing everything finishes ringing her up, and doesn't even acknowledge her (\"have a good night,thank you etc\") as she's still screaming on the phone.\n\nI wait almost a full 2 minutes for her to even acknowledge me after the first lady left, as I'm staring at her and she's still arguing with the person behind her, who has now put the person on the phone ON SPEAKERPHONE so the entire store could hear them arguing. I don't say anything, I just stare her straight in the face waiting for her to ring me up instead of focusing on her phone conversation. \n\nShe finally rings me up, not saying anything to me of course, giving me a stink face for daring to expect her to do her job instead of talking loudly on the phone. She had been having this conversation for at least 6-7 minutes now, still yelling and screaming. She finally finishes my transaction, looking away from the screen to talk to the employee behind her every so often, and at the end of my transaction, of course she doesn't say \"thank you/have a good night/etc\" to me either. \n\nI walk out and I can still hear her fucking yelling on the phone. \n\nThat was totally unnecessary and super annoying and rude. \n\n",
