        "text": "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been the leader of Senate Republicans since 2007 and was Majority Leader from 2017 to 2020. However, many conservatives and Republicans have been dissatisfied with his reign seeing that he embodies what is the so-called Washington Establishment. Meaning, that McConnell often sides against his more conservative colleagues in order to have a functioning Senate even if it means dealing with Democrats and moderate Republicans to clinch deals than holding out for more conservative legislation.\n\nThis can be seen in his dealings with president Obama over the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 and Sen. Ted Cruz-led government shutdown in 2013 and his willingness to pass omnibus spending packages with mostly Democratic votes even when he was in the majority under president Trump.\n\nWhat this means is that McConnell has always had among the lowest approval ratings of any prominent federal political leader. Unlike then-Speaker Pelosi or Sen. Chuck Schumer who were approved by their party's base, McConnell always had significant disapproval from within his own party, coming mostly from conservatives, anti-establishment types.\n\nThe critique these conservatives make is that McConnell is somewhat of a squish as opposed to a stalwart of conservative values. Whereas Democrats would rarely ever make deals with Republicans on legislation that conservatives wanted like building a border wall or cutting government spending McConnell was all to often open to working with Democrats to expanding immigration or increasing government pork over the objections of most Republicans. In fact, he'd work with mostly Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans to pass legislation presidents Obama and Biden favored. That was not the case with president Trump, who was stiffed by Pelosi and Schumer in funding conservative priorities.\n\nWhat do you make of the complaint by some conservatives that McConnell has not been an effective leader from Senate Republicans? Fair or not? Do you think he stays in leadership under a Republican president in 2024? What about his reelection in 2026 when he'd be 86 years old?",

        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that Moscow might think about adopting what he described as a U.S. concept of a preemptive military strike, noting that Rusia has the weapons to do the job. \n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-russia-adopt-us-preemptive-strike-concept-94876110](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-russia-adopt-us-preemptive-strike-concept-94876110)\n\nThe Kremlin chief also claimed that Russia's cruise missiles and hypersonic systems were \"more modern and even more efficient\" than those in the United States. \n\n[Russia intensifying production of 'most powerful' weapons: Medvedev (lemonde.fr)](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/12/11/russia-intensifying-production-of-most-powerful-weapons-medvedev_6007339_4.html) \n\nThe Western officials and the media generally describe the ongoing war in Ukraine as Ukrainians having an upper hand and also claiming that Russia is actually losing and the bombardment of Ukranian infrastructure as a sign of its desperation.   \n\n[Putin is 'desperate not to lose': Russian experts assess Ukraine war (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/putin-is-desperate-not-to-lose-russian-experts-assess-ukraine-war.html) \n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with that assessment in the West. For instance, Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) who is a senior fellow with *The American Conservative*, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, has drastically different views and assessments. \n\nMacgregor recently opined that a coming offensive phase of the conflict will provide a glimpse of the new Russian force that is emerging and its future capabilities. [At this writing](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/11/putin-could-launch-a-big-winter-offensive-in-ukraine-to-cut-off-weapons/), 540,000 Russian combat forces are assembled in Southern Ukraine, Western Russia, and Belarus. The numbers continue to grow, but the numbers already include 1,000 rocket artillery systems, thousands of tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, plus 5,000 armored fighting vehicles, including at least 1,500 tanks, hundreds of manned fixed-wing attack aircraft, helicopters, and bombers. The new force has little in common with the Russian army that intervened 9 months ago on February 24, 2022. \n\n[Washington’s Carthaginian Peace Collides With Reality - The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/washingtons-carthaginian-peace-collides-with-reality/) \n\n[Douglas Macgregor: ‘Russia will establish Victory on its own terms’ - Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/12/05/douglas-macgregor-russia-will-establish-victory-on-its-own-terms/) \n\nIn response to recent infrastructure bombings in Odessa and other cities Ukrainian [President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-has-destroyed-bakhmut-donbas-front-lines-difficult-zelensky-1766091) said in a statement released Saturday, that the strikes have left the city of Odesa and others in the same region [without power](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraines-energy-blackouts-will-most-likely-last-through-march-utility-1761250) for all things, aside from certain critical infrastructure. \n\n[Drone Strikes in Odesa to Leave 1.5 Million Without Power As Winter Begins (newsweek.com)](https://www.newsweek.com/drone-strikes-odesa-leave-15-million-without-power-winter-begins-1766180) \n\nRussia believes, the damage to infrastructure actually hinders arms shipment coming in from NATO and other countries.
