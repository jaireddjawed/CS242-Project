I know it‚Äôs a scam artist for a number of reasons such as poor use of grammar by someone who is adept, a free email address, and my belief that celebrities don‚Äôt ask random strangers who merely happen to be associated with a charity they‚Äôre involved with to write to them.\n\nMy question is this: Is it proper manners to send a copy of the message to FB fraud representatives and/or the public contact listed for this person so they can find the scam artist if they so desire? Or is it gratuitous and wasting their time because there‚Äôs actually no real chance of tracking all of these scammers down?\n\nI don‚Äôt really want to report this message because it happens so often it probably won‚Äôt even be looked at and I wouldn‚Äôt send it just to see if there‚Äôs a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll look into it‚Äù reply.

I feel like they can see that I'm insecure about my behavior, and I worry because I know that's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nWhen they're staring or acting perplexed by my behavior or making fun of me, what should I do? Idk even what story to tell myself; I feel like the \"they see through me\" story is a downward spiral.",

        "text": "I have great news! So, I made friends with two guys at University and since meeting them I can confidently say that we're definitely friends. It was one of their birthdays recently and he invited me along to his birthday party (just a chill get-together, it was super fun) and they both introduced me to the rest of their friend group! I got along with all of them really well, got invited back and at this point I've basically been adopted as one of theirs. They're inviting me to play Pathfinder with them, I've been added to their group chat and at this point, every moment with this group of people makes me so happy I could cry. \n\nHere's where the problems arise. I am **terrified** of coming across too strong, or being too clingy and accidentally scaring the rest of the group. My two mutual friends have put up with me for a while now, but I'm still scared of accidentally putting them off if I start getting too comfortable. Like, I like these people a lot, I feel like I can really and truly be myself around them, and it has been just over a week and I'm already missing them! \n\nAnyway, I guess what I'm looking for is some advice on how to not be too clingy or overbearing. I tend to get really attached to people that I like, and I guess university being a rather isolating experience until now has kinda exacerbated this. I genuinely feel so lucky to have met and been accepted by such a wonderful group of people and I'm absolutely terrified that I'm going to say or do something stupid or maybe they'll realise my personality is irritating and I'll accidentally ruin everything. Any advice you all have will be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "So this has been puzzling me for a while. I'm a guy who doesn't really subscribe to gender roles too much. Personality, tastes, beliefs don't have much to do with what's between your legs. To me, men and women are basically the same, biology aside.\n\nHaving that in mind, you'd expect I would have a somewhat equal amount of success when socializing with both men and women, yeah? Except that just isn't the case at all!\n\nI do have female friends, about as many as my male buds, but for whatever reason, when meeting new people I just never run into women I'd get along with, while dudes I'm guaranteed to get along if they're at least a bit nerdy.\n\nUsually it's a matter of a lack of similar interests. I just don't run into women who share my sense of humor, hobbies, references, etc, almost ever. But there's those rare occasions where I'll meet a like minded girl, and yet things still don't click. Like, we may have lots in common and theoretically be very compatible for friendship, but for whatever reason the chemistry just isn't there.\n\nThis is something I've dealt with for my whole life, but started noticing more recently. I started a new job and tried to make friends with two different girls I met and neither responded. I'm well acquaintanced with all my male peers and they already love me, but I just can't quite connect with women the same way. \n\nWhat could my problem be? Would specially appreciate a female perspective here, as maybe I could be doing something that other girls might recognize here and be able to point out. Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "\n\nHow I built My Social Confidence:                   \n\nStep 1: Around the summer of 2018 i finally decided to address my lack of social skills. I bought a new notebook üìí and a pen üñäÔ∏è.                                                                 \n\nStep 2: I went to public social events and places where lots of people gather like malls and central parts of cities.\n\nStep 3: I started approaching various groups of people that looked interesting to me and gave them the opportunity to write something about themselves on my notebook. I told them that I was collecting messages from people that look interesting.\n\nStep 4: Not everyone was into it but some people played along with me, and as they were thinking of what to write I would try to initiate conversation with other members of the group.\n\nStep 5: I didn‚Äôt stay for too long in any one group as to not disturb them with my random presence, but some of them actually liked my company and invited me to things. I would try to read social cues and leave if I felt unwanted or stay longer if I felt welcome.\n\nStep 6: After doing this for 6-7 months almost every weekend, I became increasingly more confident in my ability to initiate conversation with strangers and create value and fun. This gave me the opportunity to become bolder and more open. I learned when it is a good time to ask for contact information and when I should probably abort mission.\n\nConclusion: I filled 5 full notebooks in the course of a year and had countless conversations with strangers. Some of which are still my friends to this day.          \n\nLet‚Äôs have a discussion about this Matter.\n\nDo you have any questions regarding my story? \n\nWhat are the biggest challenges or concerns you have around self-development and social contact?\n\nI am dying to know what other people think about this or how they managed to overcome similar obstacles around it.\n\nYou can also follow me on @batwez7 on Twitter for Daily Content around self-development.",

Despite all this, I have trouble making friends. I've tried talking to people in my classes, and I joined a club on top of my sport, but it seems that no one wants to get to know me or get close to me. I'm not sure if this has to do with my own character, but I am guessing it does since I have had this problem all my life. I have talked to the few people I hang out with and they say I'm normal, I just don't put myself out there (mostly, that I do not go to parties). However, I have been trying my best, but I am highly sick of trying and getting nowhere. Some people have said that I'm too \"closed-off\" and \"not open,\" but I'm not certain if I can trust those people's statements because they were abusers or treated me poorly. I also tend to have anxiety when it comes to whether or not people will like me, which sometimes just ends up being self-destructive. However, I'm aware of this and try to cut off these thoughts so they don't affect my behaviors.  \n\nOn another note, I am not sure if this may have to do with my generation. At my college, it seems that no one wants to talk to anyone and they seem \"offended\" when you even ask them how they're doing. I have had people I talked to in classes/clubs that go out of their way to avoid saying hi to me by staring at their phones. I'm not sure if this is just gen Z's version of \"ghosting\" in real life and having really bad social skills with an inability to communicate face-to-face, or if it is altogether me.\n\nIf you need any more insight, I wouldn't mind answering any questions.",

        "text": "Close friend suddenly being cold and distant? What to do? \n\nI  28 (M) have a very close friend 25(F) shared a lot of deep things. I know her from my university, our friendship started during covid. We would share a lot with each other, and have almost daily calls. She was especially sharing way more then I was. But overall I did not mind and I enjoyed listening to her stories or problems she had and if I could I would help her. Our call rate would be till today her: 50% and me 50%, so it was balanced well.\n\nLooking back now, due to stuff that just happend (your gonna read in a sec) sometimes when I wanted to tell stories about what happened to my day, she would always listen. But I also had a few moments where I needed advice. She just said ‚ÄúI do not know, you need to choose yourself‚Äù . First I thought it was good advice, but then when I had a other hard time, she said the exact same thing. I do remember I felt a bit disappointed, because I would prefer if she could help me a bit more then just that one sentence. But then I stepped over it and thought she maybe felt insecure with helping me out, because she is very insecure at some points. But on other points she is a daredevil. \n\nShe also took the step to go study abroad in Italy, a big step. We continued to call for another year, and I supported her through her tough times and she kept on inviting me multiple times to come over and that I was welcome anytime. I even said, if your busy with your study, I can also just stay a weekend if you like. She replied that she did not care and always find a spot to hang out with me, even if it is for a month. I said I would love to come but maybe later, since I also needed to fix my own life. About three months ago, begin of January I told her I would like to come to visit her in February, only if she had time off course. She replied very happy and said I was welcome anytime and that it did not matter when or how. \n\nThen in the start of February I had some stepbacks in life and cov-id hit me. It hit me bad so I was stuck on bed for weeks. I did let her know, that I could not call that often anymore these days because I was feeling sick. Till this day I still have side effects of it. My grandmother also had issues so I was not feeling at my best, I also told her. I also asked about her life and she said everything is going fine and that this semester she only has one subject which she already full-filled for half, so she was just chill. \n\nHowever, time passed by and we continued to call again. But we did not speak about me coming to Sweden anymore. So a few days ago, we called again, and I noticed her being a bit cold on the phone. I did not think anything bad of it at all, I thought she was just tired. So the next day, I called her again and I noticed she was cold again. So I asked her if anything was alright and that she sounded a bit off and sad. But she said everything was going fine and no worries. After we hang up, I started analyzing about what I might have said wrong or what happend. But I just don‚Äùt know what I did wrong‚Ä¶. \n\nSometimes we even call 2/3 times a day. Since I have not visited her and I need to travel by plane to get there, I decided to look online for flight tickets and a hotel and make a plan to visit her for a few days in any of the upcoming weeks. I know I could probably stay at her place and sleep there, because she said that a few times before. I thought it still was better to book a hotel for myself, so we also had some time for ourselves. \n\nSo I called her, during lunch break to tell my plan. But she did not pick up the phone (no problem at all). So instead I decided to record a voice message, telling her about my plan to come and if she would like that?! \n\nBut I did not hear anything back. So I decided to wait till after dinner, but also did not get a response. I decided to text her, after the voice message, saying that I would love to come, but also understands if she maybe can‚Äùt (since I did not get a response back). And normally her reponse time is within 10 minutes. Then I finally got a response back saying: that she did not have time for me to come over. Just this‚Ä¶ \n\nI off course do respect that and understand it. But still to me it feels all very cold and strange all of a sudden. Since she bragged about all the free time she had this semester. She also did not come up with a later dates or possibilities, so I feel very confused and a bit sad. \n\nI do understand if her plans might have changed and that I can not come. Its not only that, but the thing which hurts me the most is the sudden change in voice of tone and behavior to me. \nIt really makes me feel like I have done something wrong‚Ä¶ but I do not know what? The only thing with what I can come up with, is that I was not capable enough to call with her that much during the time I got sick. \n\nAnd off course I do feel a bit disappointed since I thought she would react happy if I said I would come visit her. What should I do? And maybe some of you know what might be the reason? \n\nI am thinking about maybe giving her space and just wait till she calls me again‚Ä¶ But I also feel like I do not want to call with her again and that I need space haha..",

        "text": "I have a friend who I went on a trip with where I learned a couple of things that I didn't know before living with them. After a while I started noticing a pattern in which this friend makes subtle comments that somehow indicate they are better than me or others. They are usually subtle but since it happened a lot (daily) it started feeling obvious.\n\nSo some examples are: I was impressed by a beautiful forest we saw, they said that it was just okay and they have seen better in their home country. Basically the pattern would be me being very excited and happy and as a response they would make negative comments. After a while they mentioned that it's because they have \"higher standards\" for forests than me. But this was a pattern and happened with other things too. \n\nAnother example us going to the gym, me being very honest about being out of shape as I hadn't worked out for a year. Afterwards I said I was surprised at how well I could cope with exercising despite not being used to it and it making me feel  motivated to start working out again since I was biking there and I liked it. I mentioned it made me realize I can just choose stuff that is fun or me like biking is to hopefully make it a habit at some point. Their response was that the biking doesn't even break out a sweat because they are in great shape so they have to do \"harder\" things like running. \n\nAnother example is them talking about their degree taking two years longer for them to do which they had never mentioned before but rather always insinuated they had been working for a very long time already which turned out to not be the case. I \nmentioned oh I thought you'd already been working for x amount of years cause they has implied this earlier, and they were acting surprised when I asked if  they had been at their current work place for these past X years, just out of curiosity for hem and them saying well school is much harder where I'm from, it's not like it is here, it's super easy here. But I studied here so it's kind of implying that their achievements are better than mine because they deem school to be more difficult in their home country. \n\nThe would also seem to dislike it if others complimented me by making a certain look or face that would make it obvious they didn't agree. Also made some judging comments about the people, like strangers quite often. I don't care for this at all as I don't care how others choose to live their life in terms of lifestyle for example. I'm quite sure all this is because they are quite insecure as they told me this too on the trip and they mask it by trying to uplift themselves in a way that sorta outs others down. But even so, these were just 3 out of very many examples that happened and I want to know how to respond next time it happens cause I don't enjoy this kind of friendship. At the same time, we had nice moments too and I think they are a good person at heart so it's be sad to just end the  friendship completely. \n.\nMy way was mostly trying to ignore these comments in hopes they would get the hint that I won't engage cause I don't appreciate these types of comments but it didn't seem to work.. I also feel that after a while I had to work against me potentially saying something that'd indicate I'm better or superior in some way. Like the forest comment, eventually I said well I've traveled more extensively than you so I've seen my fair share of beautiful forests too. Even though I didn't agree with her comment about having higher standards than me I don't want to be pulled into these types of discussions where we try to somehow determine who is better.",

        "text": " \n\nSo  a few weeks ago I've come to know a woman and her female close friend.  We chatted a lot during breaking shifts and I would often meet them in  the office where we would talk. However today I've gotten some weird  responses. Or else more so described as personal insults directed at me.  I've heard she had therapy. But it was a small thing, like anxiety and  stuff. So I've asked if everything was fine, but I began to be bombarded  even more with insults.\n\nSo with  that I just turned my phone off and ignored her further messages.  Although this might of been just a random breakdown, I do not believe I  should be near such people who are like this. Its one thing to be  feeling sad or distancing, and completely another insulting somebody for  no reason. I've also talked to my friend about his breakup with another  psycho  (his 4th one by the way), and how those women appear  fine. But in reality they are narcissist or even psychos. With her even  proceeding to physically attack him.\n\nAnd  so with that what would your advice be? I am personally thinking on disessembling the early friendship. Even if I was to receive an apology,  the fact one can snap like that ain't worth my energy investing into.  And I don't wanna end up like my friend, dealing with some crazy gals.",

That's the mindset I'm trying to shake off, but with very little success so far.\n\nThis is only a genuine problem outside of settings where socializing is to be expected, so excluding small talk before/after uni classes for example. I just can't fathom someone choosing to spend their free time/energy on me. Recently this feeling has become more intense, since I've decided to make a conscious effort to socialize more and get out of my comfort zone.\n\nI've realized this is a serious problem for me after one classmate I got along with well directly told me that if I wanted to grab a drink sometime I just needed to text him. Still, even now I can't get out of this toxic mindset that's keeping me from being the social person I want to be.\n\nIf anyone has tips or experiences that can help in this situation, I would love to hear it! :')",

I‚Äôve had friends say to me that they always stood up for me when people made comments about my loudness and voice in general. I know I shouldn‚Äôt worry about a bunch of high schoolers in a town that I‚Äôll be leaving right when I graduate but it still hurts.",

Not in a bad way but more in a way to offer them some comfort in socialising.\n\n..and while I am on this point do you think many people who do have issues with socialising treat it more like a competition than a gathering ?

        "text": "Throughout the years from elementary to early highschool, i was bullied (verbally) quite a lot. I had no friends and still don't. In late high school, for some reason, it stopped.\n\nI thought my prospect would improve in college since I now look better than before, has improved my social ability, and am more independent from my parents.\n\nThere are many things to be said, but for now, I would like to focus on 1 particular person since I feel he's been disrupting a lot. Let's call him X. X was fine initially. I found him to be condescending but chalked it up to his personality. But now through many interactions with him, I'm sure that he just doesn't think highly of me.\n\nHe's a friend of friends and I sit a couple of seats next to him as well, so when there's a mid-sized crowd or when doing a group project, I'll inevitably encounter him which is why I can't just ignore him\n\nWhen hanging out in a group or doing a group project, when I try to say something or ask something, he'll try to clown on what I'm saying by giving me the 'ugh' attitude or spinning it as a joke that doesn't answer the question.\n\nA lot of times, I feel like he's doing his best to make me feel like I'm excluded from a group, such as steering the conversation so that I'm ignored, talked over, or responding to me with a half-assed answer in an annoyed tone. Last time I did group work with his group and he's the leader, he basically ignored me when I asked for a job so I ended up having to do the most work which wasted my studying time for the upcoming test(video editing). During the work, he just says on the group chat that I probably forgot about it. Then when I finish he (or anybody in the group) did not thank me at all and just find everything problematic about it. Basically, he made me do the bitch work, was ungrateful about it, then made fun of me afterward.\n\nThe general feeling I get from him is that anytime he needs to do something, he needs to be a smart ass about it. If I make a minor mistake in anything, he'll immediately be all over them. He treats me like an imbecile and a loser. It's almost as if he's actively rooting for me to fail.\n\nHe doesn't even respect me enough to find it awkward when I call him out like I'm a fucking piece of shit he shouldn't worry about. If I say 'well that was rude', 'i don't like that', or ask him to explain what they mean (like how I was recommended), they'll just respond back with more smug condescension like 'uhhh okay' or 'idk'\n\nWhat could I do about it? To be very honest, I'm kinda scared of calling him out over and over again. I'm timid and socially awkward. I'm not good at arguing at all. So if I did that he'd run circles around me and make me out to be the odd one. As mention I can't 100% ignore him either",

        "text": "This will be a rather long post, but I hope some people will take their time to read it.. Cause boy do I need advice\n\nI used to have a big friend group, going out for coffee or a beer for that sake during weekdays - and would be out every weekend. Because of some dumb reason they all turned their back against me (this was a bit over a year ago) Today I know they regret how they handled the situation, but I never got back in contact with them. \n\nLong story short, I met this girl half a year ago and she introduced me to a lot of people and I was back to the person I used to be, going out every weekend and meeting new people. But our friendship quickly started to drain me, and a lot of people told me to cut her off, and still do. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah and I quickly became each others best friend, but with that a big responsibility came. I had to constantly reassure her, that she was pretty enough, good enough, had a great personality and bla bla bla, you get the point. This would occur everytime we went out, and the whole ''vibe'' would be based on how insecure she felt that day. (Which most of the time were awful) she was the ''leader'' of the group, and things had to go her way.. so you can imagine how it is with a bad vibe. She would often lie, to get things her way, or be jealous/insecure when we went out since she always compared herself to me or sometimes others. This would make me feel bad, and I reassured her that people don't want me - but her. Her responds would always be ''You have to say that since you're my friend''.. But would still ask me to reassure her. \n\nFor a while I stopped, because I knew I would just get snarky responds but that would offend her\n\nOne night I just got enough of her bullshit, I had told her I wanted to go to an event for the longest time (Note I actually already had planned to go with a friend, she wanted to be invited so I did:)))))) and she reassured me that ''yeah ofc we would go'' But ofc she had to show off her new job, and when I asked when we would leave, she said ''yeah maybe later'' This girl wanted to go somewhere else because a boy she liked was there, I got told by one of our mutual friends who was with us that night, that Sarah asked her to tell me she didn't have money enough so that would be an excuse to not go LITERALLY TO THE GIRL I HAD PLANS WITH FIRST. Which hurt me and pissed me off at the same time, so I left and she got annoyed and started texting me. My response was that I got told these things, and she said it was a lie - I offered her multiple times to meet me outside so we could talk but that just got brushed over, at one point I texted ''I can't be friends with people who lies all the time'' This was not only her, but the whole group I was talking about and she knew that - she decided to block me on all social medias and refused to give me my stuff back. This was after we've been friends for about 4 months. I was very depressed at that time, not only had I lost her but the whole friend group.. I was back to square one and questioned myself, am I the reason why I'm losing friends all the time? I tried to keep my chin up, but my heart was hurtig lol.. 2-3 months later she hit me up on facebook, she apparently left the group since it was so toxic and met a guy while traveling, her reason for contacting me was she missed me, and our friendship.\n\nWe became friends again, but this time it was just the two of us - and long distance. I'll try to make this short but everything again has to go her way, we wanted to move and start traveling together, ofc to the country where the guy she met lives because she felt at home. Me being me I followed her and we traveled to London - we decided that we would go again, though I needed some time since I had an exam and couldn't book anything before. She only had to wait ONE FREAKING DAY, but she decided that right here, right now she would book everything and I told her multiple times that I couldn't just throw everything out of my hands and just leave, and that I'll book tomorrow. She got mad for me not understanding, and said my reaction isn't fair because she has a lot going on and she would just go with a friend. She said ''Everything is not about you, I have other people in my life!'' This was about a week ago and these words still kinda hurt (Note, it was our dream to get a job together in London) We haven't texted that much since she's in London right now, but when we do it's about her all the time, I told her today I got offered a job interview, her response was ''yay!'' And quickly changed the topic back to her and how she's going out bowling with other people tonight.. I'm thinking like.. okay :/ what do you want me to say? It's like this all the time and at this point I don't know if I'm jealous, or just annoyed there's so much more but I'll make a list cause this is.. too long\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Everything has to go her way\n* Very bipolar, and has psychotic issues. tho this shouldn't stop someone from being friends the bipolar is just.. a lot\n* Knows how to make you feel bad and will do it on purpose\n* Once said her friend thought I was hot, and that she liked him but in a friendly way.. Few days later she took him home and had sex. I wonder why? :)))\n* Gets jealous if someone likes me\n* Recently got mad because I talked to this guy at the club, who she liked (she literally has a man, tho not official) And we went downstairs to get beer, note how she never told me she liked him since we literally met him THAT night, and he doesn't even like girls\n* Her problems takes up a lot of time, and I feel like I'm only here for her to vent\n* Proceeds to go back to the guy she vents about, and I just feel like my time is wasted ngl (We sometimes chat for 3 hours about this whole problem)\n* Gets mad when I don't respond and spam\n* Gets mad if I skip over her question, or don't hype her up\n\nNow you may ask ''Why don't you just cut her off?'' And the thing is I love her, and I now she loves me. For the first time I feel like I found a best friend, where I'm also theirs. Most of the time she makes me feel included and would do mostly anything for me. But I do feel drained at this point, but I'm also scared to just cut her off, what if I'm just the problem?",

I wanted to learn social skills to stop overthinking conversations, which just led to overthinking conversations lol. \n\nWith time, I found the solution is to 1) rip the bandaid and 2) start all conversations the same (so I don't think of an intro). \n\nAnyone else have problems/solutions like that?",

Thankfully I already know some basic Spanish so it's not too difficult. I sit next to this nice girl in history class, she can't speak much English however she's really polite, she always says thank you to me whenever I help her with her work (I let her copy off mine, the teachers cool with it since she doesn't know much English for the assignments)\n\nI've been entertaining the idea of saying this to her:\n\n\"Hablas espa√±ol, no? Puedo hablar un poco de espa√±ol.\" (You speak Spanish, right? I can speak a little Spanish)\n\nI think communication would be easier between us if I communicated in Spanish, and I could explain the teacher's instructions to her without the teacher having to use Google translate while he explains them himself. Plus, as a person on the spectrum I struggle a lot socially so my therapist encourages me to try to do stuff like this for practice.",

        "text": "Excuse me for my English, it's my second language.  I am a Latin American immigrant woman (f30) in Canada, my husband is Canadian(m32), we are in our early 30's and we don't have children yet, we are more of an introverted couple who enjoys our quitness,  this gives some context.  I have friends of my same nationality that I met at community centers.\n\nThey are a couple (m47, f40)in their 40s who emigrated for work.  they have two children under the age of six. \n\nLast summer, the mother asked me to take care of one of her children, since she was going to return for work reasons and to fix a family matter in her country. She would travel with the youngest son and leave the eldest because he was going to start school in summer and language immersion is important. \n\nMe and my husband work from home, and I agreed to take care of the child during the hours that the father was at work, some days at the same time that I was working, I organized activities for the child, so as not to have him face to face to the television while we had good sunny days. \n\nwe even change our way of eating to adapt to more healthy and acceptable foods for a child and we spend a little money on some toys, books and activities for him.  we had a good summer and it was fun while helping our friends.  The boy's father would come for him at night after his shift at the restaurant and once school started we would pick him up.\n\nIt served us as an experience and to realize that we are not ready to have children.  Months go by, the mother of the child returns and everyone continues with their lives, and at the beginning of 2023 my husband and I went on a trip for 1 month, when we returned, the family wanted us to meet for a drink and talk.  During that meeting, the mother commented that she was very relieved that our trip had already ended because it was our turn to take care of the child again since she ALONE was going on vacation that she won selling some products at a pyramidal kind of catalog she works at, for two weeks.\n\nWithout giving us notice or anything, she assumed that we would take care of her son while her husband works (the father is more restricted in the time he can leave the country since he has a closed work permit).  \n\nRight now I have the child in my care again and I am counting the days until the mother returns.  How can I stop taking care of that child?  I feel that they are abusing a favor that I thought would be a unique occasion.",

        "text": "I'm a 20 year old male and I used to be a fat shy kid when I was younger. I got no attention from girls but recently I've had a little glowup by going to the gym, taking care of my skin, hair and so on...\n\nThe past couple of months I've been noticing a lot more girls looking at me when I walk past them, some even hold really strong eye contact for over 3-4 seconds.\n\nBut for some reason, I always get nervous and look away first after 3-4 seconds of holding her eye contact. I feel like if I hold her eye contact for longer she would call me out and call me a creep or something and I would be publicly shamed.\n\nI don't know why I have this fear but I can't get over it. What triggered me to finally make this post is what happened today. I was at a supermarket and there were 3 girls walking towards my direction. I locked eyes with one of them (she was really cute btw) and we held really strong eye contact for over 3-4 seconds. But again, I was the one to look away first because I got scared that she might think that I'm staring at her and call me a creep or something.\n\nSince then I've been feeling bad about it and wondering what would've happened if I just kept her eye contact and smiled or something.\n\nHow do I reset my mentality and get over this fear of coming across as a creep? Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks.",
