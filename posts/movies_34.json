        "text": "Seeking out movies filmed/set in continental Europe that best capture the post-Cold War, pre-Y2K feel. Computers are becoming more prevalent, and mobile phones are on the rise, but everything can still seem kind of grey and Eastern Bloc-y at times while simultaneously maintaining a forward-thinking/cosmopolitan air to them.\n\nVarious thrillers from this time seem to fit the idea of what I'm thinking of. Some examples are Nikita, Ronin, and the early Brosnan-led Bond films (I'm not sure how much an Eric Serra score contributes to this). Something like Before Sunrise doesn't quite make the cut, though Mission Impossible's scenes set on the continent are much closer. Run, Lola, Run might fit the mold, though I haven't seen this in years. The Bourne Identity comes close, too, yet is too far forward in time, tech, and feel.",

        "text": "It was the year 1941, and Nazi Germany had occupied Paris. The streets were lined with swastika flags, and the people of Paris lived in fear of the SS. Among the most feared of these SS officers was Colonel Hans Landa, also known as 'The Jew Hunter.'\n\nLanda was a fearsome man, with piercing blue eyes and a sharp wit. He spoke fluent French, and he knew the city like the back of his hand. He had a reputation for being ruthless, and for hunting down Jews with a passion that bordered on obsession.\n\nOne day, Landa was walking through the streets of Paris when he saw a beautiful young French woman. Her name was Annette, and she was working in a café. Landa was immediately smitten by her beauty and her charm.\n\nHe started visiting the café every day, just so he could see her. Annette was wary of him at first, knowing who he was and what he stood for. But Landa was persistent, and he slowly but surely won her over.\n\nThey started seeing each other in secret, meeting in hidden corners of the city where no one would see them. Landa was careful to keep their relationship a secret, knowing that if his superiors found out, he would be in big trouble.\n\nBut one day, Annette's father was arrested by the SS. He was accused of being a member of the Resistance, and Landa was tasked with interrogating him. Annette begged Landa to show mercy, but he refused.\n\nIn the end, Annette's father was executed, and Landa was forced to watch. The experience shook him to his core, and he realized the true horror of what he was doing. He knew that he could not continue to live this way, and that he had to make a change.\n\nAnd so, Landa turned against his own people, becoming a spy for the Resistance. He risked everything to help them, gathering information and passing it on to his new allies. It was a dangerous game, and Landa knew that if he was caught, he would be executed.\n\nBut he continued to work for the Resistance, driven by his love for Annette and his newfound sense of morality. And in the end, it was his courage and his willingness to do what was right that helped to bring down the Nazis in France.\n\nHans Landa may have started out as a villain, but in the end, he proved to be a hero. And his story will go down in history as a testament to the power of love, and the strength of the human spirit in times of darkness.",

Which the second does to a degree, and the third just straight up does without any hold back. Oh yeah that's another thing that Clerks does: it doesn't hold anything back. At all.

When you watch his interviews, he seems to have such warmth and the interviewers all gravitate towards him. This interview [click me](https://youtu.be/j5osaBtgVuk) is a perfect example of how he just charms off people - complimenting the surroundings, being game to whatever the interviewers throw at him. I know some people out there dont think he is attractive but he is such a charming dude and that adds to his attractiveness and appeal.\n\nI also feel like people who are charismatic tend to have great chemistry with the people they work with - may it be romantic or just all in all giving a certain friendly vibe. Going back to Matt Smith again, he has lots of chemistry with his co-stars.\n\nOther people in this category imo - Domnhall Gleeson, Margot Robbie, Denzel Washington, Daniel Kaluuya, Paul Rudd, Hannah Waddingham",

That tells me that River was a trusted exemplar who had significant influence over his younger brother’s decisions.\n\nDid his older brother’s life guidance and ultimate tragic death perhaps inspire Joaquin to excel in his craft? Did he channel the trauma, grief, and loss into onscreen magic?\n\nThen again, is it too far-fetched to imagine the first ever sibling best actor Oscar winners? Any shared thoughts on this?",

I don't mind the third one, I did enjoy the action in that one, even the ripped off motorbike fight from \"The villainess\". Since there's nothing in the cinema for the next few weeks and Donnie Yen is in John Wick 4, I might give it a try and go watch this chapter on the big screen. However, since after all these years I still don't get the raves this series get, I'd like to know more about the movies that make it's fans tick. \n\nWhat are your 10 favourite action movies?",

Probably one of the most disturbing movies I've watched and I've unfortunately watched shit like a Serbian film. \n\nBelow is spoilers. \n\n\nThe fact that I could honestly believe that's how young women get sex trafficked is praise enough script wise. \n\nJonathan Tucker has always been a favorite of mine but I hope he wins some awards for this. Incredibly creepy. At first you could almost think this guy is just an opportunistic guy who knows what he's doing is bad but does it away but then when he slowly reveals what's he's up too, Jesus Christ. Made my stomach hurt. \n\n\nThe standout is obviously the main actress who plays the teenage girl. Absolutely mind blowing how good she is. I'm calling it, this is going to be like how winter's bone was how Jennifer Lawrence blew up. \n\n\nAnd most importantly, the director. As a first film it's just so strong. Rarely a directors debut is so good. Stoked to watch more from this director.",

        "text": "Can we just discuss the 2016 film adaption of Stephen Kings novel \"Cell\" which stared Samuel L. Jackson and John Cusack which was destroyed by critics and movie going audiences for being one of the worst films made\n\nI have to ask what the hell went wrong with this movie? \n\nOriginally Eli Roth wanted to write and direct the film and wanted to keep the brutal, graphic tension of the books opening sequence for the entire run time, making the film feel like you never have time to breath and scared from the events happening. He was planning to make the film more in the style of a Romero \"Zombie\" film with the brutal level of gore, carnage and chaos but with more of a big budget. \n\n\nSomewhere, I suppose he left the project because he didn't want to stress himself out personally because of the film studio producers who wanted to make drastic changes in the script so he chose to pursue his own original projects. \n\n\nStephen King ultimately helped write the final script for the film with Cusack producing the finished product which in turn in my opinion was an awful, campy, ridiculous film\n\n\nI personally think the idea of a zombie film in the style and brutal gore of a Romero film with the original concept of the book could have been really captivating and interesting \n\n\nSad we never got to experience that version.",
