        "text": "I've always understood 'contradictions' to be two things that cannot be right at the same time. Such as 'It is raining outside my house' and 'It is not raining outside my house.'\n\nBut I've also heard people use this to refer to things in society. That if you want to criticize a political system - like say you are criticizing fascism - that you should do so by pointing out the contradictions in that system.\n\nBut what does that mean?  What would contraditicions in a system like fascism, or Stalinist communism mean? Because I've always heard such systems criticized based on, say, their extreme cruelty and the mass suffering they cause. But those aren't really 'contradictions' as I understand the term.",

        "text": "Not always, but generally, the disposition of the history of philosophy is laid down as a sequence of Great Men and their ideas. You can find many textbook or lecture series that basically just go over philosophers lecture by lecture, e.g. it goes like Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, etc, etc, Hume, Kant, Hegel. If you get lucky, you get a chapter or two that provide a general overview of the Greek philosophers or the medieval philosophers, but beyond that there is very little discussion of the socio-cultural environment around them and the intellectual Zeitgeist of their times.\n\nSometimes it feels ridiculous. For example, recently I was looking for the context around Kant's \"Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?\", and I felt like the only way to get the information I want is to go to darknet and buy the works of Zöllner and Biester on Silk Road, translate them and write secondary sources I expected myself  (because it feels like the whole Internet hides them from me). There is just so little information about intellectual ideas at large during Kant's life than about Kant and his ideas.\n\nAre there books, compilations or other forms of works that can truly be described as history of philosophy (or even philosophies) rather than history of philosoph*ers*? Something that puts margins from a textbook on Kant to the center and puts Kant to the margin?",

He defines idea as being a concept built, not passively perceived, by the mind (Part II, def. 3) and that the idea of singular existing things is caused by an infinite string of ideas (Part II, propos. 9). But at the same time, he claims that our body gives us inadequate ideas (the last propositions of Part II). \n\nMy doubt is: how come there is no relationship between different attributes and there is no passivity in our minds? For instance, if I have an idea that a certain particular apple is red, isn't it a result of my body perceiving things and my mind thinking about the data it received from the senses? How come there is this infinite string of ideas going back to god that made me have this idea, right now, of that apple being red? Is there something I'm missing or misunderstanging?",

How having can put obstacles to being and becoming. For instance, a life-long dream of mine has always being having a horse. \n\nIt allows me to connect with nature and form and keep a positive bond with another living being. Now, that I have suicidal thoughts almost everyday and feel a profound sorrow, having a horse soon is what keeps me looking forward to the future. \n\nYet as I articulate this, I realise how much of a self-created need this desire is. I realise how investing 30% of my savings in buying a horse, would put me behind financially. It would be wiser of me to invest that on a business that will generate more income, if I was to prioritise self-preservation, or invest it on another project to help others, if I was to prioritise social contribution. \n\nI often find myself reasoning arguments and counterarguments, and when I go for the logical, reasonable (sound) decision, I found myself sad for not pursuing that which makes me feel alive and excited to stay alive as opposed to taking my own life. \n\nI am really worried about this trait of mine, which reflects profound intellectual immaturity or perhaps something worse.\n\nTo have or not have a horse, that is the absurd question I seem to care about most these days. \n\nWhat is your thought process or method to make a decision such as that one: to have or not to have a horse, to go for what you want versus for what you should.",

Violence could even be the struggle to exist because it is an expression against the void, where this unity, this thing is attempting to… exist? In the face of some opposition, and there is a tension. Tension between two things interacting with one another.\n\nSo how can this tension be more peaceful? Do we reach back to the idea of a monism? Where if there is only ONE thing, then there is no tension or relationship between two or more things? Therefore a prerequisite for “violence” is multiplicity, or many things. Or an end to violence means having a winner in this tug-o-war tension where the opposition is gone.\n\nWhat if the two or more things have a mutual goal? That is, “traversing together.” Vague enough to satisfy both, yet specific enough satisfy on the individual level?\n\nSorry, I don’t know if this is an appropriate question.",

They have the impression that the animal world is brutish, cruel and filled with suffering, and that the natural history of animals seems to convey an horrific picture. I have since then discovered that this is a very popular view of the natural world.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe naively, I have always imagined that the lives of animals are really not that bad. Sure, lots of them perish due to violent deaths, but on the other hand I have the impression that it is not really a big deal if what came before wasnt too bad. For example, if I lived a tolerable, pleasurable life, and then suddenly a guy came into my house and killed me, I wouldn't say that my life has been bad (its violent ending does not seem, at least to me, to offset the rest of it). I would say something similar about, say, a deer who spends its last minutes (or even hours) getting mauled by a mountain lion. Of course I could be wrong in assuming this last claim (and I could also be wrong that animals' lives are, before their abrupt ending, tolerable – maybe a biologist could tell me of some species whose existence is mostly agony, idk).\n\nWhat are some books/textbooks/anthologies that deal with these themes?

And the Intension itself can either be some stereotype or ideal imagine/idea of something that either exists or does not exist, whereas the Extensions is the manifestations of the Intension; the Intension decides the Extension.\n\nExample: A chair. The Intension \"chair\" is like the ideal chair, there are many ways to express chair (brands, types, styles etc) but they all come back to being something along the lines of: \"something that is intended to sit on that usually has 4 legs and a back rest\". (I just made up some summary of chair). The extension of chair are all of the chairs that we know of in the real world, or all things that fit the mold or idea of what it means to be a chair.\n\n(Correct me if im wrong please!)\n\nAnyways, the question is: can an Intension have muiltiple Extensions? Or vice versa? \n\nOr even more complex: can one Intension have multiple different expressions, which each in turn lead to different Extensions, where the Extensions then all lead back to the same Intension? Or can different Intensions, each with their own expressions, have the same Extension which in turn goes back to the different Intensions?",

        "text": "Epistemology is a subject that has fascinated me since as far back as I can remember.   Understanding how we know, what it means to say we know,  what is true etc. \n\nOver time, I have kind of come to the conclusion that as a individual that I can conclude that True exists, but that I can never know that something is True or not True.   \n\nI can evaluate if a system of rules is consistent and then assess if an assertion is consistent with with those rules and call that true.   But I\"m not sure that is really evaluating truth of something external so much as checking pattern modeling capabilities that seem to be a key component to human intelligence. \n\nThe more time I spend on the subject the more I have come to the belief that at least in common usage, when we say something is true what we mean is that it is creditable and further, that we we are actually says is that we believe it is probably true (though because we can be uncomfortable with uncertainty there will be those who decide at some point that something just IS true even though they have no more reason to believe it than someone who more honestly understands that they think it is likely) \n\nAdvertisement has long had a rule of 7s when they would try to make sure they got a message they wanted a consumer to believe to be heard by them 7 times from 7 different sources.   And I think this plays to our brains building a credibility heuristic subconsciously that says that information repeated from different sources is more likely true.    Like if you heard 1 person tell you that your best friend was talking badly behind your back, you might not believe it, but if 7 different people unrelated to each other tell you, you might feel a need to confront them.  \n\nAlso I think the source of the information impacts how credible you find it.  If you have been thought from a young age to respect certain authorities; you will value information from those authorities as very probably true.  So you believe what police say happened if you were taught that police are trustworthy, etc.   \n\nWe have tools that help us assess credibility and trustworthiness. but I think this only get applied if we have reason to doubt.  If we directly witness something inconstant with what a trusted source that told us was true.   But, when I say we have tools.  These tools are things not usually taught to all.  They are things that usually come with higher education and even then not in all fields.  \n\nSo while to an academic, to a philosopher, epistemology may indeed be about tools of assessing truth.  I think to the vast majority of the population truth is a matter of trust placed in particular sources and subconscious heuristics such and hearing the same thing repeated.",

Still larger electrodes, such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists, are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other classical electrophysiological techniques include [single channel recording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_clamp) and [amperometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amperometry).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Electrographic modalities by body part\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electrophysiology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Electrophysiological recording in general is sometimes called electrography (from [*electro-*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/electro-#Prefix) \\+ [*-graphy*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-graphy#Suffix), \"electrical recording\"), with the record thus produced being an electrogram. However, the word *electrography* has other [senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_sense) (including [electrophotography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirlian_photography)), and the specific types of electrophysiological recording are usually called by specific names, constructed on the pattern of *electro-* \\+ \\[body part [combining form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_compound)\\] + *-graphy* (abbreviation ExG). Relatedly, the word *electrogram* (not being needed for those other [senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_sense)) often carries the specific meaning of intracardiac electrogram, which is like an electrocardiogram but with some invasive leads (inside the heart) rather than only noninvasive leads (on the skin). Electrophysiological recording for clinical [diagnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis) purposes is included within the category of [electrodiagnostic testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodiagnostic_testing). The various \"ExG\" modes are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Optical electrophysiological techniques  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Optical electrophysiological techniques were created by scientists and engineers to overcome one of the main limitations of classical techniques. Classical techniques allow observation of electrical activity at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue. Classical techniques singularize a distributed phenomenon. Interest in the spatial distribution of bioelectric activity prompted development of molecules capable of emitting light in response to their electrical or chemical environment. Examples are [voltage sensitive dyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_sensitive_dye) and fluorescing proteins.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After introducing one or more such compounds into tissue via perfusion, injection or gene expression, the 1 or 2-dimensional distribution of electrical activity may be observed and recorded.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Intracellular recording  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Intracellular recording** involves measuring voltage and/or current across the membrane of a cell. To make an intracellular recording, the tip of a fine (sharp) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell, so that the [membrane potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential) can be measured. Typically, the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be -60 to -80 mV, and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach +40 mV. In 1963, [Alan Lloyd Hodgkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lloyd_Hodgkin) and [Andrew Fielding Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fielding_Huxley) won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contribution to understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials in neurons. Their experiments involved intracellular recordings from the [giant axon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_giant_axon) of Atlantic squid (*Loligo pealei*), and were among the first applications of the \"voltage clamp\" technique.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#cite_note-3) Today, most microelectrodes used for intracellular recording are glass micropipettes, with a tip diameter of &lt; 1 micrometre, and a resistance of several megohms. The micropipettes are filled with a solution that has a similar ionic composition to the intracellular fluid of the cell. A chlorided silver wire inserted into the pipet connects the electrolyte electrically to the amplifier and signal processing circuit. The voltage measured by the electrode is compared to the voltage of a reference electrode, usually a silver chloride-coated silver wire in contact with the extracellular fluid around the cell. In general, the smaller the electrode tip, the higher its [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance), so an electrode is a compromise between size (small enough to penetrate a single cell with minimum damage to the cell) and resistance (low enough so that small neuronal signals can be discerned from thermal noise in the electrode tip).\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecording of the visual cortex of a cat (1981);\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Single-unit recording  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Main article:* [*single-unit recording*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-unit_recording)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;An electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip. If the electrode is a microelectrode, with a tip size of about 1 micrometre, the electrode will usually detect the activity of at most one neuron. Recording in this way is in general called \"single-unit\" recording. The action potentials recorded are very much like the action potentials that are recorded intracellularly, but the signals are very much smaller (typically about 1 mV). Most recordings of the activity of single neurons in anesthetized and conscious animals are made in this way. Recordings of single neurons in living animals have provided important insights into how the brain processes information. For example, [David Hubel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hubel) and [Torsten Wiesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Wiesel) recorded the activity of single neurons in the primary [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex) of the anesthetized cat, and showed how single neurons in this area respond to very specific features of a visual stimulus.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#cite_note-6) Hubel and Wiesel were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#cite_note-7)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Computational electrophysiology\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electrophysiology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20)\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While not strictly constituting an experimental measurement, methods have been developed to examine the conductive properties of proteins and biomembranes [*in silico*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico). These are mainly [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulations in which a model system like a [lipid bilayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer) is subjected to an externally applied voltage. Studies using these setups have been able to study dynamical phenomena like [electroporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation) of membranes[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#cite_note-23) and ion translocation by channels.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#cite_note-24)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The benefit of such methods is the high level of detail of the active conduction mechanism, given by the inherently high resolution and data density that atomistic simulation affords. There are significant drawbacks, given by the uncertainty of the legitimacy of the model and the computational cost of modeling systems that are large enough and over sufficient timescales to be considered reproducing the macroscopic properties of the systems themselves. While atomistic simulations may access timescales close to, or into the microsecond domain, this is still several orders of magnitude lower than even the resolution of experimental methods such as patch-clamping.\\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Clinical electrophysiology\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electrophysiology&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21)\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Clinical electrophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_electrophysiology) is the study of how electrophysiological principles and technologies can be applied to human health.

Cardiac electrophysiology can be used to observe and treat disorders such as [arrhythmia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia) (irregular heartbeat). For example, a doctor may insert a catheter containing an electrode into the heart to record the heart muscle's electrical activity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another example of clinical electrophysiology is [clinical neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neurophysiology). In this medical specialty, doctors measure the electrical properties of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain), [spinal cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord), and [nerves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerves). Scientists such as [Duchenne de Boulogne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_de_Boulogne) (1806–1875) and [Nathaniel A.

The two gray planes indicate the [hydrocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon) boundaries of the [lipid bilayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer) and were calculated with the ANVIL algorithm.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-anvil-5)\n\nThere are two distinctive features of ion channels that differentiate them from other types of ion transporter proteins:[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-isbn978-0-87893-321-1-4)\n\n1. The rate of ion transport through the channel is very high (often 106 ions per second or greater).\n2. Ions pass through channels down their [electrochemical gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_gradient), which is a function of ion concentration and membrane potential, \"downhill\", without the input (or help) of metabolic energy (e.g. [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate), [co-transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-transport) mechanisms, or [active transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport) mechanisms).\n\nIon channels are located within the [membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) of all excitable cells,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-all-3) and of many intracellular [organelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle). They are often described as narrow, water-filled tunnels that allow only ions of a certain size and/or charge to pass through. This characteristic is called [selective permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_permeability). The archetypal channel pore is just one or two atoms wide at its narrowest point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium) or [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium). However, some channels may be permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a common charge: positive ([cations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation)) or negative ([anions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion)). Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in a single file nearly as quickly as the ions move through the free solution. In many ion channels, passage through the pore is governed by a \"gate\", which may be opened or closed in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force.\n\nIon channels are [integral membrane proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_membrane_protein), typically formed as assemblies of several individual proteins. Such \"multi-[subunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit)\" assemblies usually involve a circular arrangement of identical or [homologous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)) proteins closely packed around a water-filled pore through the plane of the membrane or [lipid bilayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer).[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-isbn978-0-87893-741-7-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-isbn0-397-51820-X-7) For most [voltage-gated ion channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel), the pore-forming subunit(s) are called the α subunit, while the auxiliary subunits are denoted β, γ, and so on.\n\n## Biological role[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2)]\n\nBecause channels underlie the [nerve impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_impulse) and because \"transmitter-activated\" channels mediate conduction across the [synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse), channels are especially prominent components of the [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system).\"\n\n## Diversity[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)]\n\nThere are over 300 types of ion channels just in the cells of the inner ear.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid17541769-11) Ion channels may be classified by the nature of their [gating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)), the species of ions passing through those gates, the number of gates (pores), and localization of proteins.\n\nFurther heterogeneity of ion channels arises when channels with different constitutive [subunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit) give rise to a specific kind of current.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-12) Absence or mutation of one or more of the contributing types of channel subunits can result in loss of function and, potentially, underlie neurologic diseases.\n\n## Classification by gating[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)]\n\nIon channels may be classified by gating, i.e. what opens and closes the channels. For example, voltage-gated ion channels open or close depending on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated ion channels open or close depending on binding of [ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)) to the channel.\n\n## Voltage-gated[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5)]\n\n*Main article:* [*Voltage-gated ion channel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel)\n\nVoltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to [membrane potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Ligand-gated (neurotransmitter)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6)]\n\n*Main article:* [*Ligand-gated ion channel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand-gated_ion_channel)\n\nAlso known as ionotropic [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)), this group of channels open in response to specific ligand molecules binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor protein. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the structure of the channel protein that ultimately leads to the opening of the channel gate and subsequent ion flux across the plasma membrane. Examples of such channels include the cation-permeable [\"nicotinic\" Acetylcholine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine_receptor), [ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_receptors), acid sensing ion channels ([ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid-sensing_ion_channel)),[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-13) [ATP-gated P2X receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2X_Receptors), and the anion-permeable γ-aminobutyric acid-gated [GABAA receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor).\n\nIon channels activated by second messengers may also be categorized in this group, although [ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)) and second messengers are otherwise distinguished from each other.\"\n\n## \n\n## \"Classification by type of ions[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9)]\n\n* [Chloride channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride_channel): This superfamily of channels consists of approximately 13 members.

The plasma membrane accounts for around 2% of the total membrane in the cell, whereas intracellular organelles contain 98% of the cell's membrane. The major intracellular compartments are [endoplasmic reticulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum), [Golgi apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_apparatus), and [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria).

On activation, these helices move about and open the pore. Two of these six helices are separated by a loop that lines the pore and is the primary determinant of ion selectivity and conductance in this channel class and some others. The existence and mechanism for ion selectivity was first postulated in the late 1960s by [Bertil Hille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertil_Hille) and [Clay Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Armstrong).[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid5315827-29)[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid4644327-30)[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid4541077-31)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid_1194886-32)[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid29363566-33) The idea of the ionic selectivity for potassium channels was that the carbonyl oxygens of the protein backbones of the \"selectivity filter\" (named by [Bertil Hille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertil_Hille)) could efficiently replace the water molecules that normally shield potassium ions, but that sodium ions were smaller and cannot be completely dehydrated to allow such shielding, and therefore could not pass through. This mechanism was finally confirmed when the first structure of an ion channel was elucidated.\"\n\n\"Because of their small size and the difficulty of crystallizing integral membrane proteins for X-ray analysis, it is only very recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels \"look like.\" Particularly in cases where the crystallography required removing channels from their membranes with detergent, many researchers regard images that have been obtained as tentative. An example is the long-awaited crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel, which was reported in May 2003.[\\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-pmid12721618-35)\"\n\n## Pharmacology[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13)]\n\n*Main article:* [*Channel modulator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_modulator)\n\nChemical substances can modulate the activity of ion channels, for example by blocking or activating them.\n\n## \n\n## \n\n## Diseases[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16)]\n\nThere are a number of disorders which disrupt normal functioning of ion channels and have disastrous consequences for the organism. Genetic and autoimmune disorders of ion channels and their modifiers are known as [channelopathies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelopathy). See [Category:Channelopathies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Channelopathies) for a full list.\n\n* [Shaker gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaker_gene) mutations cause a defect in the voltage gated ion channels, slowing down the repolarization of the cell.\"\n\n## \"History[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ion_channel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17)]\n\nThe fundamental properties of currents mediated by ion channels were analyzed by the British [biophysicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics) [Alan Hodgkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hodgkin) and [Andrew Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huxley) as part of their [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine)\\-winning research on the [action potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential), published in 1952. They built on the work of other physiologists, such as Cole and Baker's research into voltage-gated membrane pores from 1941.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-39)[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#cite_note-40) The existence of ion channels was confirmed in the 1970s by [Bernard Katz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Katz) and [Ricardo Miledi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Miledi) using noise analysis\\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\\].\"",

Personally, I don't agree with this and I'm finding it really hard to defend that position. I mean there are literal laws that prevent this from happening. Anyway here's what I've come up with so far:\n\n1. Affects productivity\n2. Decreases office morale (eg: Co workers working overtime to pick up his slack etc.)\n\n2)Company might not be equipped to accommodate his disability\n\nSo far I'm only able to approach this from a utilitarian perspective. I'm hoping y'all can help me look at this differently and come up with more talking points.\n\nThanks",
