        "text": "  At one point a few years back, I ended up working in a small, privately owned restaurant. It was set on a small main drag in a tiny,  historic community. The restaurant definitely stood out amongst the locals and tourists due to its multicultural food variety. The restaurant served everything from american cuisine, to Indian, Thai, French and Middle Eastern foods.\n\n  The small restaurant was formerly a popular, privately owned Chinese restaurant and a local favorite. But unfortunately, the older man that owned and operated it, passed away inside the restaurant one day, so suffice it to say that the local town's folk didn't take too kindly to the foreign city woman that bustled in shortly after his death and purchased his restaurant. Not only was my former boss flaky and irresponsible, but she could also come off as quite curt and rude at times. So, she had a rough go at first obtaining the proper permits and what not in order to renovate the historic building. The thing is that when you do certain renovations in an old building like that, the local law laws require you to then update a lot of other things that could be quite costly. So that meant that she decided to just use the staff that she'd hired, which was us, to help her with most of the renovation work.\n\n  Everything was going pretty smooth, you know, nothing out of the ordinary. That is until one overcast, drizzly day when we were all gathered in the dining area for a staff meeting. As we all sat there quietly, listening to the boss lady, something a little strange happened. The front entrance door to the restaurant suddenly opened to about halfway and then carefully closed after a second, as though someone had simply stepped in. Of course, there was no one there as the door was almost entirely glass and we would have seen a person on the other side. We all looked at one another confused, but we just chopped it up to be the breeze since the back door was open, though there was a set of closed kitchen doors in between.\n\n  The second odd thing to happen, happened to another employee when she was there alone one night. According to her, just after she turned a corner passing a shelf with some tools on it, an empty cordless drill case went flying past her head! It barely missed her and smashed into the wall in front of her! She definitely seemed pretty put off when she told us about it in the kitchen the next day.\n\n  Following that, random small things would happen here and there. Like, our boss would ask us once in awhile why one of us didn't come into her office when she'd see one of us walk by her open door, but we were usually puzzled by that, as none of us had ever even walked past her office during that time.\n\n  Besides that, we'd get the occasional strange sound, like a faint voice or a door opening or closing. Also, when I'd be in the kitchen putting together some ingredients for a recipe and I'd have to walk away for a second to go grab another ingredient off the back shelf or something. But when I'd return less than 15 seconds later, one of the ingredients I'd set out prior to leaving the area, would be gone! I'd end up having to measure out and prepare the same ingredient again, annoyed. But I had no idea that it was about to get a lot more terrifying for me.\n\n  The final thing to happen to me and my other co-workers was the worst experience I ever had that was paranormal hands down! But, in order to properly explain this part to you, I'm going to need to explain a couple of things about restaurant kitchens to you. In a typical restaurant kitchen setup, you have a cook line and the cook line is literally that, a line as in a skinny walking or standing space typically between the oven, fryers and cooktop with the prep surfaces and small fridges on the opposite side, leaving about a three to four foot walking aisle forming a cook line. Besides that, there's a dishwasher outside of that line, followed by the rest of what you'd expect to find in a restaurant kitchen. You know, like fridges and freezers all on a large scale. You also got your giant hood fans above the cook area and a hot water heater. The reason why I point all those out is because together, they all constantly make noise. Think like louder ambient background noise constantly.\n\n  So this one day, there are three of us working in the kitchen. Me, my boss and another employee on the dishwasher. My boss and I were on the cook line, while the dishwasher was a few feet away from the cook line. We were all three working as normal, when all the sudden, it got quiet. Think of when you don't realize you've been hearing a constant low sound untill it suddenly stops and then you notice the sudden change in the noise environment. Except for I mean it absolutely got dead silent. Almost like an invisible sound proof blanket got thrown over the three of us.\n\n  As soon as I noticed it, I looked around at the other two and they also looked puzzled. \"What the hell?\" I questioned out loud. \"Why is it so freaking quiet all of a sudden?\" Asked the dishwasher guy, suspiciously. \"I don't know\" my boss replied, drawing out her words nervously. She turned to face me, as I was standing directly behind her on the narrow cook line. \"Nora, go make sure that the fridges and hood fans are still running, maybe the power is out?\"\n\n  So I ventured the ten or so feet to outside the cook line area and weirdly enough, I could hear the hood fans and even the dishwasher, hot water heater and all the fridges and freezers running like normal! I went back to my boss and with a confused look, told her \"everything's working fine.\" That was the first creepy part of that, but when I stepped back onto the cook line to tell my boss, all was silent again! \"Well Nora, get back to work grilling those peppers!\" She snapped. So I got back onto the cook line beside her.\n\n  After a couple of minutes though, I suddenly started to get tunnel vision and I felt really dizzy and nauseous. I told my boss and she told me to go sit out back for a few minutes and get some fresh air, which I promptly did.\n\n  As I was sitting outside trying to feel better, I could see my boss go into her office, which was kitty corner from the back door. Since the back door was open with just the screen door closed, I was able to hear her while she made a phone call. She sounded urgent and shaky as she asked the person on the other end of the line to please bring in an abalone shell, some sage and some kind of weird oil! Now, the reason she needed those particular items was because according to her, she had felt something walk through her on the cook line that wasn't good! The shitty part is that I was standing right behind her, inches away on that cook line!\n\n  I waited for her to finish her phone call and return to the cook line before I went back in.  By the time I got back in, everything sounded normal again on the cook line. When I got off my shift about an hour later, believe me when I say that I made the normally 45 minute drive home in just under 30 minutes!\n\n  All night that night, I tossed and turned, unable to really sleep. But, the few times I managed to slip into sleep, I kid you not, I got jolted right back awake because I would see a screaming demon-like thing right in my face!",

        "text": "Yes, this story is 100% true. I should have it be known beforehand, i have never had any mental health conditions of any kind, and i do not do drugs of any kind. This happened to me a year or so ago, and I never really been able to explain it; so i thought perhaps i'd share it here.\n\nWhen I was sitting at my desk one day, browsing the internet.. I took a moment to sit back in my chair and put my head down, i closed my eyes for a moment.. But again, for no reason, i decided to keep my eyes closed for a moment longer and just rest them from the strain... I went to open them again, but something weird happened.. I can only describe it as.. I opened the wrong eyes.. Like it was some kind of mental slip.. When i opened my eyes.. I wasn't at my desk anymore.\n\nI could see straight infront of me what looked to be the edge of a hospital bed. As if i were lying in it with my head facing to the side of the bed. It certainly wasn't your standard bed frame, because it looked plasticky and white.. Behind the edge of the bed, it looked straight out onto an ocean which went uninterrupted into the horizon. \n\nNaturally i found this to be bizarre; i tried to turn my head.. I tried to move, i tried to merely turn my eyeball.. But i couldn't. I could still feel the normal sensations that would trigger when one would go to turn their head or their eye, but i could not move at all. All I could do was look out at this horizon and the edge of this bed... I even recall thinking to myself \"Is this a dream?\",  and i recall checking with myself over and over to see if what i was seeing was real, because i was fully conscious of what was happening. I really wanted to see the rest of the room i was in, but i simply could not turn away or move at all.\n\nNow then, i could feel a weird urge to let go of where i was.. Like i'd stumbled into some weird state of mind, and i couldn't hold it any longer.. Kind of like when you try to stay awake from falling asleep.. Or when you try to keep your eyes open and you are eventually forced to blink. Eventually, it gave way and like that, i was back in my mind, from there i opened my normal eyes again. It all happened when i was fully awake and conscious.. I even tried to recreate the situation again to see if i could open this weird eye a second time; but i simply couldn't find my way back to it.\n\nAnyway, thought i'd share this story here because it was weird... If it was a hallucination, it felt very real, and i felt very conscious and aware whilst it was happening. I'm not sure what to make of it, but it has kept me wondering about the nature of reality... It has kind of made me think real life is fake, and i'm actually lying in some bed with a coma.. In which case.. Any advice on how to wake up? I suppose i'd be asking my own mind.. But hey, maybe that is how it works.",

The towels hanging on the back of it were swaying back and fourth. Then I thought it must be my dogs trying to go outside, so I went to look and no dogs were in the house and everyone was still asleep. I went back to my bed to process what just happened when my aunt called about 6:13 am and told me that my cousin had just been found dead a couple states over. I was in shock majorly.",

It may not have been a paranormal experience, I may have been hallucinating, or it may have been an optical illusion caused by the mirror.

At one point it was horrible foot steps, things missing, seeing people and shadows in the corner of your eyes, being touched the basics. So I feel the need to rate some of the experiences i remember. At one point my mom spoke to a priest it was so bad and he said we probably have some sort of portal? idk\n\nThe faceless man 9/10\nIn our typical trailer you can see straight through the house, I was leaving the bathroom and noticed the tall man peeking. He was faceless and wore a top hat. I ran back into the bathroom and hoped it went away. I heard heavy footsteps come to the door and as I child I was horrified and crying for atleast an hour before I darted to my room.\n\nThe outside girl 5/10\nIt was a saturday night and my little sister would stay at my grandparents to go to church sunday (literally 30 second walk to their house) and we heard what we thought (me, mom and 3 others) was my sister crying out to us. we obviously rushed outside to get her but no one was there. shook all of us up. this is the same time my mom was seeing some old timey dressed little girl in the corners of her eyes.\n\nThe man just standin 8/10\nIt was during hurricane season and our lights had went out, so being a the 13 yr old I was and how my house was I was too scared to sleep in my dark room alone so I slept in my living room. I remember waking up randomly and seeing a full body shadow of someone infront of the back door. It just stood there and made no movement but it really scared me it looked like a genuine person, atleast 5’4. (no one in my house shaped like that) So of course I threw the blanket over my head.(thanks to moms ex husband saying when stuff like that happens he covers himself and would say if I can’t see it it can’t see me LMAO) anyways I was scared shitless and it just disappeared I guess.\n\nI love to hear about others experiences(pls share omg) because even though sometimes it’s scary it’s so interesting that this stuff is genuinely real. like why isn’t it more talked about???",

Our bathroom and laundry room have a huge wall between them that's been half-cut out, so you can go through and see through it.\n\nI was just minding my business getting into the shower, but immediately I felt a sense of someone watching me undress, so I shut the door in the laundry room. I turned around, but then I suddenly heard a deafening slam. The door, which I heard lock in place, just flew open. It couldn't have been the wind because there's nothing that could let wind in, and there's no mechanisms that keep the door open. I was petrified and tried forgetting about it, but in the back of my head I'm thinking it might be my late dog, who always liked butting his head into doors to open them when he couldn't find us.

I am still not sure how much do I believe that ghosts are real, even though some things happend before. However recently I started to have this weird \"dreams\". It's hard to explain this feeling but it's not a normal dream? It doesn't feel like a lucid dreaming (ordinary for me) or sleep paralysis... And I am healthy, there is nothing physical or mentaly wrong with me.\n\nThis summer I was staying with my friends at a holiday apartment. Imediately, some rooms felt just wrong, something mame me to stare into few corners/places but I didn't really care.\n\nBefore we went to sleep the light started flickering - the switch was making sounds. But we were like ok...The night I also \"woke up\" and saw a smoky black figure standing next to me, trying to touch me. Well, when it almost reached me (now it gets crazy) my body started to puls with energy, started to get really hot and everything was tingling. Then it was released in waves? and the figure went away. In the morning and also folowing days I felt full of energy, slept like a baby. Can't say that about my friends.\n\nNow, I will get fast with the next incident. The same (but different figure) happend at my home. But now the waves were much stronger And more controled? I felt the same.\n\nAt both times my watch showed weird activity in terms of hearth rate and sleep. I am not sure how to feel about this. It feels way to crazy for me but on the other hand, it felt too real. Any ideas?",

        "text": "P.S: I am not a native speaker so please bear with my English. \n\nHello, I( 23F) have been living at my house since I was born. Seven years back, we constructed a new outhouse with minimal furniture, which is approximately 20 meters away from the main home. Since construction, I have used the outhouse more than any of my other family members to study and attend online lectures to avoid getting distracted. But ever since 2021, I have witnessed subtle oddities during my time there. On January 2021, the wall clock suddenly stopped at around 4:20, my mom and I changed the batteries, and it started working. The next day it stopped at about 4 again. So I bought a new clock with new batteries and hung it on the wall. It worked well for a couple of days but stopped working again. Frustrated, we bought one more clock, inserted new batteries, worked for a couple of days, and it stopped again at 4:10. All three stopped clocks are still in the new house. We gave up, and since 2021 there have been no working clocks in the house; it almost feels like time doesn't exist when I enter the house to do my tasks. Whereas the clocks in the mainhouse work, as usual, there are no issues here. Although we found it strange, my family did not think much about the incident and went ahead with our life. I did some googling to find the spiritual meaning behind stopping clocks, especially around 4, but nothing turned out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved away from my house to pursue higher studies in a different city (I did not experience any weird there) and returned on August 2022. I started using the outhouse again for studying and preparing for my exams. As I finished my tasks for the day, I went ahead to turn off the lights, and suddenly I felt a slight tap on my upper arm. I completely lost my balance and hit myself against the wall. Again, I thought to myself it must have been me being clumsy/drowsy, and went back to the main house to sleep. But the incident that happened two days ago drove me to post in the subreddit. I finished studying around 10 PM at night. I turned off the lights, and just before I stepped outside the door to lock it, I felt someone/something whisper in my ear. Although I didn't see anything visually, it sounded gibberish, and the thing whooshed past me. I felt a sudden waft across my face. I rushed outside, locked the door, and went back to my main house to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not discuss the incident with my family members because I would definitely get laughed at/ said that it's all in my head. I don't understand what I have been experiencing. Is this a haunting that I should be aware of or a spiritual experience or am I just overthinking?",

        "text": "My story isn't to old. I live in my great mother's house. She died about 3 years before I was born &amp; her name is Elizabeth. My son was born in 2009. When he was a toddler &amp; started talking good &amp; playing he would constantly talk to someone/or something. He would giggle &amp; say \"Li-li sing it again!\" One morning when I got home from work he was sitting in his highchair eating breakfast &amp; watching cartoons. My dad was in the other room. I heard him talking &amp; carrying on &amp; he said , \"Li-li my mama is home! Tell her the song!\" I heard that &amp; asked him what song &amp; he started singing \"Jesus Loves Me.\" I never knew he knew it nor did I ever sing it to him. I figured one of grandparents told him. So I sat down somewhat dozing off because I work long night shifts. He then was explaining to his frien Li-li who the Bubble Guppies were &amp; laughing &amp; answering questions. Started giving me the creeps.i asked him who is Li-li was... I was assuming it was one of the characters from one of cartoons he watched. He said \"no mama My Li-li is my friend she's a grandma friend &amp; I just my Li-li and she loves me, and she loves you, and she loves my Mema the Great (what he called my grandma), and she loves my Shug (what he would call my mom)!\" So I figured he saw something on TV. Fast forward a few days and I was at my grandmother's for lunch or something &amp; started looking through photo albums. He came up &amp; sat in my lap looking at photos with us. While we were talking he suddenly picks up one picture in particular &amp; gets extremely excited. \"Mama! That's her! That my Li-li! Ain't she a pretty grandma?!\" It was a picture of my great grandmother Elizabeth. Everyone called her \"Lizzie.\" I sat in awe &amp; told my folks around about this Li-li stuff. He said that his Li-li would tell him stories, tell him about her kids, &amp; sing to him, and watch him play. My grandma asked what she sang? He excitedly started sing \"Jesus Loves Me,\" followed by a toddler version of \"She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain.\" I never sang those. I'd mostly sing Beatles songs to him &amp; would put him to sleep singing \"Yellow Submarine.\" We all were shocked &amp; really in awe. A few seconds later he said \"Mama Li-li loves all of you very much. She's a very proud grandma &amp; is happy we live with her... but... she said you need to learn to cook better &amp; make me a 'choc-it' cake like Mema the Great.\" My grandmother made chocolate layered cakes from scratch... it's her mother Elizabeth's recipe! I still live my great grandmother's house to this day. Stuff will be moved, lights turned off if you leave them on when you leave, doors shut, and I woke up to the heat coming on. We're happy and \"Our Li-li\" takes great care of us.",

        "text": "This happened to me in 2009. I had been living with my mom, her boyfriend, and my brother. We were living in a big 3 family house in an old part of the city. It was an old house and it always felt off to me. I would often have trouble sleeping at night and would wake up for no reason as if something was there, watching me. One night I had come home from work and was very tired and passed out immediately after I took a shower. I started to dream but it was very strange because it was my room and I was sitting up and just looking around. All of a sudden I looked down and saw a dark cloud coming into my room from under the door. I looked at this\"dark cloud\" in awe and was puzzled. As it came in, it started to form into a tall, human like being. All of a sudden my tv turned on out of nowhere and a voice that sounded like something out of a horror movie spoke and said, \"You are in Hell\". I immediately woke up and was so full of fear and was so scared out of my mind that I ran to my window and tried to claw my way out of the room. We were on the third floor but I was still half asleep and screaming to get out. I finnaly snapped out of it and ran to turn the light on, my heart racing. There was nothing in the room and I was just breathing hard and trying to gain my composure. I saw nothing in my room but I could not go back to sleep that night. The next day my brother came up to me and told me that last night he was in his room which was right next to mine and he said he saw a dark presence going up the stairs and straight into my room, right before I woke up screaming. It sent shivers down my spine knowing I wasn't the only one who saw it. For months after I wouldn't sleep without my light on. I had this horrible feeling that if I turned everything off and tried to sleep it would have come back to terrorize me. Once I moved out of there it never happened to me again. I feel like that house was haunted or just had a dark entity habitating there. I will never forget that night....",

Nothing weird has ever happened except one time my niece asked me to stay with her so mommy will stop sitting on her at night (her moms passed.) I chalked it up to a bad dream bc she is post traumatic and bc it never happened again.\n  The past few months weird things have been happening. I was curious if pregnancy can stir things up bc it’s a change? The first thing I heard was tapping at the kitchen window, I check and there’s no tree branches or anything to make that noise. I swear I saw a woman leaving my nieces room one night which really freaked me out bc the dreams my niece use to have. If it is her mother it isn’t a good thing bc she was a horrible woman and very abusive. I couldn’t tell if it was my sister or what,  I just saw a woman like figure walk out. It really freaked me out and I searched the whole house and found no one. I was so worried I slept on my nieces beanbag in her room. I seen it a few times after that always by my nieces room. Only for split seconds or I seen a unrecognizable shadow. know how crazy this sounds but I’m honestly scared shitless. The craziest part is Last night my niece and I were both in the kitchen eating dinner when we heard MY voice just say “heyyyyy” from the other side of the house. This really freaked me out. I know this all sounds crazy but it’s 100% true. Idk why this just started. Nothing spooky has ever happened here. Nothing changed in my life except me being pregnant. Does anyone have an idea why this might be happening or what’s this mean? I’m really freaked out. It’s not a constant thing each thing happens days apart or sometimes a week or two.",

In fact I’m usually able to easily see a normal reason for the paranormal things I’ve seen on this sub. Because of this a lot of my time on this sub is spent trying to prove the post are caused by non paranormal means. Alas you can read the story below.\n\nIt’s a real short story, I was around 15 years old going about my day as normal. I’m walking to my brothers room and look through my sisters door as I do. When I look inside I see a small/young girl with brown straight hair weeping on my sisters bed with her face in her hands, I can’t remember what she was wearing. My heart dropped and my pace slowed where I looked at her for a good few seconds. I passed the door and could no longer see inside, I built the courage to look again but when I did the girl was gone. Later that day I explained to my sister what happened. It freaked her out because she had been having nightmares about the exact thing I saw for days beforehand. I was the first person she told. We still talk about it occasionally mainly so we don’t lose the memory. \n\nThat’s my only experience with anything paranormal and I don’t have a good explanation for it other than the unlikely event that both of our subconsciousness knew something was going on with my sister and told us the same thing in different ways.

About 5 months ago I was awakened to see a tall, about 8 feet, man in what looked like a duster coat with big “wings”.

A member of my family (wont say who just in case) is a diplomat who got stationed in japan, so my whole family moved there when I was 6. We lived in the Czech embassy in Japan for four years and some crazy shit apparently happened. The most important thing was when an older member of my family had a sleepover in the embassy cinema with a couple of his Japanese friends. They had sleeping bags and pillows which they put in between the seats in the back row . The older member of my family woke up at around 2 am (they speculate as they didnt check their phone) to a plant in the corner of the cinema right next to a wall (no one could’ve been doing it since there was no room) shaking rapidly. Now they have a lot of sleep paralysis so they didnt think that much of it until they noticed his Japanese friend shaking looking down muttering something, when he got her attention she told them “Don’t look at it, they will want you to help them”. After some time ( dont know how much) it stopped and they booked it tf out of their.) \n\nAnother instance is the receptionists and such (all Japanese,all believed in the supernatural as Japanese tend to do) often saw the cupboards start opening and closing rapidly with a bang. \n\n\nI never knew about this until a year ago or so (i was small, and the only indication i ever got was my mother refusing to go down there)\t\n\nThis is one of the three or so paranormal instances that i know of so yeah.",

While I was pregnant, I kept seeing dark shadow things moving in my house out of the corner of my eye. One night, I actually saw the shadow thing go right by me and it went past the router and the lights on the router disappeared like something covered it, and then came back on. It was not the usual blinking of the lights either. After I had my son, I stopped seeing these things. I've always heard that kids are more sensitive to things like that so I thought maybe I was seeing these things due to my being pregnant.\n\nMy son is now almost 5 months old. I keep having these nightmares, though. In the nightmares, I wake up in bed and the room is exactly set up how it is in real life, I'm in the same pajamas, etc. In these dreams, there is something in my house that comes after me and then I wake up. Last night, I had one of these dreams. (I've been having them pretty frequently). In the dream, I woke up in bed and knew something or someone was in my apartment. I then heard the toilet flush. I looked over and my partner was sleeping. Then, I heard footsteps. It sounded like something running as fast as it could, towards me. The footsteps came into the bedroom. My boyfriend then woke me up because I was screaming. This is basically how most of these dreams go and I get woken up because I'm screaming, kicking, punching, in my sleep. \n\nCould this be any indication that something is in my apartment?\n\nSide note: the other evening, someone knocked on our door and yelled \"let me in, I'm cold!\" We opened the door, and nobody was there. The way my apartment is set up, if someone was there, we would see them leaving. There is a pretty long walk to get to the parking lot.",

It was like if you took a video of someone walking but cropped out the top half of the image so it was just the person's bottom half. After seeing this my boyfriend and I turned to each other as if to say \"did you see that?\". I got up to go make sure it wasn't just my dad but he was completely asleep.",

Only, I was already in the kitchen with them and my husband when I heard my voice from the other side of the house. I think the cats heard it too since they all stopped meowing immediately. The tv wasn’t on and no music was playing. Not sure what to make of it- my husband had his headphones on so didn’t hear it with me. I’m chalking it up to my own imagination, maybe one of the cats (though they were with me and the voice was faint- like coming from another room), or possibly residual energy repeating our little ritual. All I know for sure is it creeped me tf out so I thought I’d share here.",

        "text": "I’m not the type of person to believe in the paranormal, nor have I ever had a paranormal experience besides these three occurrences.\n\nThe three occurrences occurred within hours of each other in the Fall of 2017 shortly after my father passed away from a long battle with cancer. I was 23 at the time. He fought this disease for ~16 years but eventually lost. He was a smart and funny person, but also quite the micromanager and, at times, petty. He would be the type of father who is clever enough to know if you’ve been smoking pot or getting into benders with your friends, even if you thought you could hide it from him.\n\nMy father wasn’t the nicest person to be around at the end of his life. My mother did her best to provide for him, but he felt that it wasn’t enough. He passed away in our house one grey October morning. After the body was removed, we tried to tidy his belongings the best we could and console each other. The next afternoon was when the occurrences began. I’ll list these out in chronological order.\n\n1. My father loved his Amazon Alexa. My mother, brother, and I didn’t really care for it. My mother was crying on the couch, lamenting that she failed to keep my dad alive and that she could’ve done more for him. From my point of view, she went above and beyond to help my father, even when his behavior towards her border-lined verbal abuse. I had my arms around her and told her, “Mom, you did more than enough.” Then, Alexa lit up and responded, “I don’t think so! I don’t think so!” Usually, Alexa would only respond if called. Also, if she didn’t understand your question, she’d respond, “I didn’t quite catch that” or “Hmmm, could you repeat that?” My mother and I looked at each other and she gently laughed, “See, even your dad thinks so.”\n\n2. I smoked weed at the time. My father didn’t like this and especially hated it when I smoked in the house. I was smoking weed in the bathroom while my brother was brushing his teeth next to me. My mother was across the house in her room. I was being careful and was blowing the smoke out the window. My brother didn’t smoke at the time so he just tended to his teeth brushing. All of a sudden a series of loud knocks rang on the bathroom door. My mother shouted, “What’s going on in there? Are you smoking weed?!” She opened the door and I was busted. I asked her how she knew. She pointed at an old alarm clock we kept plugged in the corner and said that machine was blaring like crazy. Weird - I didn’t hear a single thing, and the clock was about 10ft away from the bathroom door. Moreover, we recently had a mild electrical blackout and didn’t bother to reset the time, so the clock was just idly blinking 00:00 - I wouldn’t expect a clock in this state to trigger an alarm.\n\n3. The wifi failed that same night. I heard my mom call to me and my brother from across the house, “Boys, is your wifi also down?” We checked and sure enough the wifi logo on our phone was gone and we were using LTE. No problem, we’ll just go to settings and reconnect. “Invalid Password”. This is weird - we had the same password for years and never had this happen. The password was “{our last name}family”, so for example “forsterfamily”. Of course “Forster” was my father’s surname. Seems like my dad took his surname away from us. There was no way to fix this issue, so we eventually changed our password to our dogs’ names.\n\nAnyways, that is all. Thought I’d share my three and only paranormal experiences with you guys.",

        "text": "Hi guys, I just wanted to share a few very strange experiences that I had when I was at university a few years ago (UK).\n\nOkay so for context, I have had many experiences with the paranormal throughout my life. These ones are just a few that have popped into my mind just now while browsing. Right, to begin I had just enrolled at my university as a \"mature student\" (I was 22, so a little older than the norm which is around 18/19). Because of this I was allowed to enter my dorms a week before the rest of the students would arrive. So I was basically the only person staying in an entire apartment block for the week, 7 floors and probably over 100 rooms. I lived on the 7th floor. \n\nDay 1: Okay so, I was part of a head start programme for mature students getting back into education. On my first day I went to the icebreakers and got to meet my fellow mature students, quite a good time I must admit. So, the evening comes and I'm leaving everyone and heading back to the block. None of the friends I had met earlier in the day lived in my block so it was kinda sad. Anyway, I get back, put a pizza in the oven and just hop into bed and start watching random shit on my laptop. About 10 minutes later I hear the door to my flat open and close. \"Yes! I've got a flatmate now!\" Is what I had thought. So I rushed up out of the bed and went to open my door to greet them. As I look out from my room into the hallway, nothing. No one. I look either side of the hallway before leaving the room and it is completely empty. Me being the extrovert that I am I assume that maybe they've already gone to their room (somehow?) so I proceed to knock on all the doors of my flat one by one (there were 10 rooms + a kitchen). After knocking on all of the doors and getting no answer I just dismiss it as me hearing things or a weird noise from the oven. I just eat my pizza and fall asleep to the TV.\n\nDay 2: I wake up full of energy and excited for the new day. I have a mini football that I brought with me and since I'm the only person in the flat I figured if I'm gonna kick this ball around and make a ton of noise then I should probably do that before all my flatmates move in and complain. I got the whole flat to myself for a week! So I immerse myself into smacking this football around the entire flat, off the walls, ceilings, against the oven, fridge - anything really, plus it was small so wouldn't cause any damage. After I'm done with that I go to my introduction sessions and make a few friends there. One of them is called \"George\". We're all getting along and having a good time and then the evening comes and I have to head back. This time I just head to my room, drop my bag and head into the kitchen. I make dinner and chill for a bit then I head back into my room and watch some TV. It's starting to get late like 3/4AM (I'm a night owl) and I start to hear groaning in the hallway outside my room. It kinda sounds like someone who's had too much to drink and is stumbling to their room. I open the door. Again, nothing, no one. \"Hm, that's weird. I'm sure I heard someone.\" I get back into bed and maybe 5 minutes pass when I can hear what distinctly sounds like nails scratching on the outside of my door. \"Okay, I deffo have a flatmate. They're probably drunk af and I'm gonna go help them out.\" I rush to the door again. Same thing. No one is there. I knock on all the doors again and no answer. This happens a few times that night and I eventually get tired and fall asleep.\n\nDay 3: Not much happened on the third day but I did notice something that was strange. The football I was kicking around the flat would always end up under my bed in the far corner no matter where I left it the night before. I had only been there for two nights at this point so I just thought maybe the floor was uneven (I later found out it wasn't).\n\nDay 4: Okay, same usual routine of going to my sessions and then heading back. This time, I'm up late again and get a bit hungry. I open my door which is right next to the kitchen and as I'm about to enter and turn the light on I hear \"Hey!\". Clear as day. It was such a vivid sound that I even pictured George's face in my head as I turned around because it sounded like him. I thought a new flatmate had come to greet me. However, when I do turn there's nobody there. The hallway is empty yet I specifically heard someone call out to me. Strange. I end up going to the fridge, grabbing a snack, then heading back to bed and falling asleep.\n\nDay 5: After all of the strange goings on in the past four days I reckon to myself that I do have a flatmate and I just haven't met them yet. So when I get up I knock on all the doors again but still no answer. I go about my day same as before. I stayed out late this night as there was a little party/social gathering on campus. As I'm coming home now I open the door to my block with my key card and walk over to the elevator. I normally press 7th floor and when it arrives there's a pleasant female voice that says \"7th floor\" or whatever floor you're on. So as usual I press 7. The elevator has mirrors on every wall so I'm just staring at my reflection blankly while it goes up. Then, as it gets to my floor instead of the female voice coming out of the lift it was a MALE voice. What it said I don't remember. But I do remember as I'm looking at my reflection my eyes bulged open. Like \"WTF WAS THAT?\" I look at the number and it is my floor. Thinking that my mind is playing tricks on me and maybe it had been a male voice not a female's the whole time, I press 6 to go down a floor. When I arrive, just like always the female voice comes out of the speaker announcing \"6th floor\" in the same pleasant tone. \"Maybe it's a male voice for the 7th? Idk.\" I go back up to my floor and this time it's back to the female voice. WEIRD. Anyway, I just head back and unwind until I fall asleep. \n\nDay 6: Probably the least eventful day. Not much out of the ordinary happened, other than the football always ending up under my bed. So it was kind of a nice change to be honest. Instead I spent the time going floor to floor and just looking at the empty block to see if anyone at all had moved in. Nope.\n\nDay 7: I wake up to the sound of people chatting outside the entrance to my block. I jump out of bed and look out the window (it overlooked the entrance). \"Finally, some flatmates!\" I get dressed and head straight down to greet them. There's a group of them that have just arrived and have started moving in to the block. When I go over and speak to them they're talking about ghosts, and paranormal things. Then I ask them \"Why did you bring up this topic?\" And then one of them tells me \"Our campus is haunted. This is the most haunted campus in the UK\" and that someone had killed themselves in the block that I had just been staying alone in for a week, a few years prior. He had lived on the 6th floor and had been having a hard time and ended up jumping from his room window. I was a bit startled and thought they were lying but then one of them shows me an online article about it. \"HOLY FUCK. ALL OF THAT SHIT WAS HAPPENING WHILE I WAS THERE BY MYSELF THE WHOLE WEEK!?!\"\n\nThen I proceeded to tell them about what had been happening and how I didn't know that the block or campus itself was haunted. Needless to say it spooked tf outta them. But hey, at least I've got other people living in the block now too eh? \n\nOver the course of that year I spent in that block I experienced many more paranormal occurrences that I haven't included but yeah, that place is most definitely haunted, there was always a strange feeling. Funnily enough it's right opposite a cemetery and I often wondered if there was some sort of connection. And like I've said before, during the time these events had taken place I was very comfortable with paranormal experiences so I didn't really shit myself, but it always is a little creepy.",

Neither of our families like the other so this was the only way we could see each other.\n\nAnyway we generally met at a church that was about half way between our houses.\n\nThat night we met up and hung out for a while and it started to get really foggy. The fog was coming in from her way and it was so thick you literally could not see through it. It was like a wall of fog was coming down the highway.\n\nSo we walked back to my house and got in my mom's car.\n\nOn the road to my house, there was a church and it had a tall street light. We looked back and saw a shadow cross that light but it was so foggy we could not tell what it was. But whatever it was, it was big. Tall, very tall too as that street light was at least 30 feet in the air.\n\nWe got to my house and we got in my mom's car because neither of us wanted to risk waking my parents up.\n\nA few minutes later the fog started coming around the curve and started down the hill. I remember wondering how fog could follow a road and not just cover everything up as it advanced. In time it did cover everything up though and about that time the ground started shaking like it was a mild earthquake.\n\nThe shaking got more intense as the fog got thicker and engulfed everything.\n\nA couple of minutes later we saw a huge leg pass by the car we were sitting in and whatever was attached to it kept walking down the road, all the time covered in that weird thick fog.\n\nA few minutes later the shaking stopped and the fog passed us by although I could still see the tail of it moving into the forest that was at the bottom of the hill on the dead-end road I lived on.\n\nWe looked at each other questioning what had just happened to us, neither of us quite believing our eyes but being too smart to disregard what we had experienced. I let her stay in my room that night until the sun started to come up and walked her back home in time for us to both go to school that morning.\n\nDid I believe in giants? Not until that night I didn't!\n\nFrankly, I don't know what the FUCK that was but it sure as hell was not anything I would consider normal. That was 35 years ago and to this day it still terrifies and fills me with a sense of wonder when I think about that night.\n\nImma head out now.",

Yesterday, I put the doll in a sitting position to be sure it wouldn't fall anymore. It somehow did, though, but I forgot to pick it up.\n\nWhen I remembered about it, the doll was sitting perfectly in the ground(it didn't seem like it had fallen at all), facing my bed. Bit creepy, but okay.\n\nWhat made me feel really uneasy about it happened just now. I left to go to the bathroom. The doll was sitting on the shelf, facing the bed. I came back to the bathroom and the doll was facing the door, with her feet in a different position than it was.\n\nThinking that a doll I bought out of aliexpress could be cursed is absolutely ridiculous to me, but I didn't move it and other than me, there's only my fiance in  the house. He didn't do it. He wasn't home when the doll was in the ground facing my bed and now he was sleeping pretty heavily in the other room(he even got a bit angry at me for waking him up just to ask if he moved a doll or not. He does think that these dolls are scary, though(which I used to disagree, they're pretty cute)\n\nAny thoughts? What should I do with it? Should I get rid of all 3 dolls? I'm scared of throwing the doll in the trash and upsetting it, in case it is really cursed...",

I don’t know the specific tour I went on as I wasn’t in charge of booking it but we got to go through several of the buildings and had a couple of encounters as well.\n\nThe first encounter was in the showers of one of the holding areas. Our guide lit up a cat ball and tossed it into the shower and it lit up a shadow onto the wall of the shower which was so cool to see. \n\nThe second encounter was much more intense. We were in the death row section of the prison, in a basement and our guide was trying to get some of the spirits there to show themselves and they wouldn’t. So to draw them out our guide began to talk about something unrelated to the tour and we looked toward the end of the hallway toward the only source of light and a shadow figure began to slowly creep out from behind the wall leading around to the other side of death row. It was such a surreal experience to see that. \n\nI don’t know how many people will end up seeing this but if you read through and it I can 100% recommend MOSP. I’ll be at the Sallie House soon and am so excited to be staying the night there.",

        "text": "After moving in to our current home, the kids (2) started saying they thought we had ghosts. \\*\\*shrug\\*\\*  I paid no attention, I hadn't seen or heard anything. At one point one of the kids said there was an \"old man\" here named Walter who spent his time in the attic. The other child said she had seen a little boy (mist like) in her room and it scared her.  I wasn't too worried but we walked the house with sage. To be honest I had a few minor experiences but nothing that scared me and I tend to second guess these things. One day while I was home alone, as i walked down the hallway I heard a man whisper something like \"Hello\".  I never figured out what it was. A few other head scratching events and I decided to borrow my adult daughter's ovilus and motion activated music box. I also utilized our indoor security camera to look for clues. This video is interesting because of all of the orbs.  It was filmed in October, minimum bugs, and the odd thing is that they all seem to be going the same direction, same angle, following the first orb I was hoping for some feedback on what others saw, hoping I can post the video.  I see the option for video but it is greyed out.  I'm wondering if I should use YouTube and post the link here?",

I was around 7 or 8 when we moved to this certain house. I can't remember the towns name but it was a small town with nothing around but a Walmart. \n\nEnough about the background. This house was rustic looking. Not very updated. There was always this vibe about this house, like you weren't alone and everyone felt it despite trying to deny it.\n\nThe first time I heard anything was once when I got home from school. I was the first one home so I decided to play video game. I really into the game until I heard a creaking noise. Like when something is leaning back and forth in the wind. \n\nI could hear it coming from the dining room. I put my ear up to the dining room door and I'm certain the noise was coming from there. I open the door and the noise stops and i hear a huge thump. I feel a huge cold draft come out of the room. I try to figure out what the noise was but  never figured it out.\n\nThat same night, I fell asleep in the living room and again was woken up to the creaking noise. I ignore it but for some reason I get this feeling of dread and look towards the hallway and can see the silhouette of someone in the prone position on the floor. \n\nI thought it was my brother trying to scare me so I turn back and start to fall asleep until I hear a quiet voice call my name. I immediately feel dread and pull the covers over my head. I start to hear foot steps coming towards me and stop immediately above me.\n\nI'm literally about to shit bricks, in my head. I tell myself to start swinging. I didn't care who was standing there. I do just that and nobody is there. I go sleep in my moms room and keep it to myself. The curiosity was killing me so I asked one of the neighbors who has lived in the neighborhood for a while if he knew anything. \n\nThis certain neighbor was an older man. He was usually a jokester and was always laughing and joking. As soon as I asked, his face turned serious. \n\nHe asked me why I was asking so fast. Apparently the previous owner killed herself. Apparently she hung herself from the dining room chandelier. I swear I never felt chills like that before. \n\nI am convinced I was hearing her body rock back and forth and that big thud was when the chandelier gave out. The only reason I say that is because the chandelier is no longer there. \n\nI'm also convinced she called my name.",

I was sleepy and felt quite comfy so I decided to close my eyes. Then I realised that I was having a sleep paralysis and I opened my eyes.

        "text": "A long time ago I lived in the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The neighborhood we lived in was surrounded by graves of the natives. Me, my brother, and my friend, being the stupid kids we were, decided to go ghost hunting around them. There was this field behind my house where some of the graves were located. Far down to the side of my house there was a parking space which was known for paranormal experiences and sightings of the “Night Marchers” (Hawaiian legend). We were out here, trying to communicate to the ghosts, asking questions and such. Note that the time was around 8-9 PM, so the street lamps were on. Suddenly, one of the street lamps next to the space were inside shut off. It was only that streetlight, so it was very unlikely a coincidence. We got spooked and my friend said “Let’s go man, I’m kinda scared.” And suddenly next to us we heard a chilling voice out of thin air that said “Relax.” We knew we had to go.\n\n2 weeks post incident, weird things started happening in our house, potentially a “haunting”. There was cold smoke in the kitchen often without a source. I would often wake up to the lights in my room randomly turning on at between 2-4 AM every few nights, always between that time. My dog would always bark at the door to our backyard around the same time of night. I do believe the series of events are connected.",

After that he stood up and got off the train as the doors opened and more people came inside, that's where I saw that he went through people.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this man? What does he want or why is he in the metro making small talk with other people? He looked happy but then sad, but like a melancholic feeling.",

        "text": "Good Morning guys, thought I’d share some stories from my apparent haunted workplace. \n\nI was told in my interview and training course that the home was haunted and everyone has experience or felt something; makes sense, most of our residents are receiving palliative care and unfortunately the inevitable happens and residents pass pretty frequently, so it makes sense that a building like this would be haunted. \n\nOur PPE is stored in a cellar, which as soon as I was told about, I tried avoiding as much as possible until I did a night shift 8pm-8am and needed to go down their to get more pads. It was definitely eerie as it was around 2am I had to go down there, it was cold, damp and horribly quiet. I heard some noises but was so focused on getting the heck out of there, I just grabbed boxes and got out. \n\nIt wasn’t until a few days later I was telling a colleague about my shift and said the cellar was grim and I didn’t feel good being down there. This is when she told me that there’s a hole down one of the small walkways and it was used to transport the departed to the church over the road from us. Everyone has had weird feelings and discomfort down there, I don’t think it’s a coincidence. \n\nAs of late, our home is closing down due to the financial costs of keeping the home resident-friendly. It’s sad because it’s a really beautiful home and everyone is like family. Because of this, over the few weeks residents have slowly been transferred to new accommodation so we’ve gone from 20 something residents to about 8. \n\nI was on a night shift and upstairs, I only had 3 residents to check on so it was pretty quiet as they tend to sleep through the night pretty well. Two of my residents are in the same corridor, but the other is across the landing and on the opposite side. I check on my other two, they’re fine, go to the third residents room and notice on the other end of the corridor where all rooms are now vacant, there’s a shadow standing by the door. I tried to calm myself and debunk, it could be our PPE bags or something else. I focus on my resident and she’s fine so I quickly glanced over to see and the shadow is now gone. I turned on the lights for the corridor and the PPE bag had been removed, there was nothing to create a shadow at the door. \n\nI decided to walk around the long way to my single resident because I was scared but as I walked past an empty room, the door swung open. Once again I panicked and tried distracting myself with checking my resident, I went back after convincing myself it was an old building and maybe my fatass walking past it may have caused it, the door was closed and didn’t happen again. \n\nFor context and legitimacy, there’s only myself and one other who works nights, he was downstairs the entire time. We only go to each other when the other calls. Im sure if it is haunted, the spirits are of the residents who’ve sadly passed away here and mean no harm, but scary nevertheless.",

        "text": "\n\nSo most of my life has been relatively normal and boring. I love to read people’s experiences because I feel like I lack them. I’ve had maybe 2 or 3 mild paranormal things happen in my life. Except this one experience that to this day haunts me, and I can’t explain and will probably never will. \n\nOkay this happened in grade 8 around 13/14 years old. This kid JJ had just moved into town and my friend group essentially ended up taking him in. He was living with his Aunt and her boyfriend. He lived down the street from me and it didn’t really take long for us to become good friends. So anyway one day me JJ and our 2 other friends are hanging out at JJ’s place. It was maybe only like the 2nd or 3rd time we’d been there. His Aunt and her boyfriend are telling all of us that this “Satanist” lives in that shack behind the dumpster. Behind his dumpster was like a black boarded off like small house. Idk it was weird it had stairs going up to a second floor and everything. \n\nSo they’re telling us that this supposed satanist lives in there and sacrifices animals for the devil and performs rituals. They said they’ve seen dead chickens in the trash all bloodied and stuff. They then are telling us about another kid who lives in the apartment who was taking trash out one night and he claims he saw a goat come out from darkness from the satanist shack, calling out his name Brian. We’re in 8th grade so we’re all like “Yea, sure that definitely happened”. Yea little did we know what the fuck was about the go down. I’m sweating just typing this ugh. I’ve always wanted to post this because it’s the only Interesting experience I have but it’s a lot. \n\nBeing the dumb kids we are we decided to make probably one of the worst decisions ever and take JJ’s pellet guns and shoot said Satanic shack. Don’t get me wrong I’m always down for a good shooting but this felt wrong. Not only could there actually be a satanist performing rituals living in there but this is almost straight vandalism if someone actually lives in there. We all took a couple shots at it from his porch. JJ lived on the second floor of 3 floor apartment. I’m pretty sure we shattered the windows  on the shack but there was wooden boards behind it. Everything was boarded up. \n\nAfter our stupid decision to commit vandalism we really went about the day without anything out the ordinary. It was later that night that shit hit the fan. We’re all in his living room with his Aunt chilling having a good time. And I can remember hearing as clear as day this “Baaaa”. This straight goat/sheep noise, it was so clear. Only one other friend of mine heard it and he asked if we did. As we’re explaining what we just heard to the rest, all of a sudden this giant silhouette appears in the window to our right. It was so tall taking up the whole window it was clear as day. The most perfect silhouette of a goat standing with 3 horns one in the middle. We all back up and ran the couch literally stunned, absolutely silent. I’d say maybe 20-30 seconds of it in the window it turned left and walked away. And In an instant and I mean instantaneous was at the other window which was maybe 50-60 feet out AND around a corner. This is no way a normal being could’ve done what it did. \n\nThis window it moved to was open however, with only a screen down. And it was leaned over into it. Now we could see it. Face to face it’s eyes and everything. It was white, with a huge head, two horns with one in between the two. We didn’t see its whole body, just a giant white goat head that till this day I can’t ever forget. So now we can see this goat in the window it’s staring at us we’re all frozen so shocked because we had known we shot this dudes shack and his aunt told us that story earlier. JJ kept whispering “don’t look at it. Guys stop don’t look at it.” I could take my eyes off it. I felt like I couldn’t not look at what was in front of me I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I’ve never been so afraid of something yet so intrigued and fixated on it. My heart was beating so fucking fast I thought I was gonna throw up. We’re all essentially trying to be chill and act like we can’t see it but I know this thing felt our fear 100%. His Aunt was trained in the Air Force and her boyfriend wasn’t there. She was so nervous I remember who saying “ I’m going to get my gun”. The goat didn’t move a fucking inch the whole time. Even after she said that. She came back with her gun and maybe another minute or so (idk it felt like forever so these time conversions aren’t perfect) it just leans away and vanished. \n\nWe were all so shaken up and absolutely terrified. It was close to Halloween. We thought someone may have been fucking with us but from it moving instantaneously to the other side of the apartment and not reacting after getting a gun drawn on it. Yea till this day I still don’t think it was person. There’s not really much to say after that. I remember we did somehow manage to fall asleep in his living room. I guess because there was 4 of us and his aunt was in the other room with a gun idk how we did. One of our buddies who was Mormon woke up with 3 scratches on his neck which was creepy. I wasn’t able to sleep the next day however at my own place. I kept staring at the window literally shaking. \n\nI’m sorry if this was terribly written. I never write or post really but scrolling through Paranormal tonight I just felt like I have to share this with people. I’ve only told 1 person and it’s my brother cause I feel like people will call me nuts. My friends and I know what we saw and I know we’ll never forget it until we die. The one only interesting story I have in my life is a satanist summoning a demon goat on my friends and I after shooting his shack😂 Has anyone else had an encounter with a goat figure at all?",

He had some really different ideas on things &amp; I could see alot of his points &amp; actually shared some of his perspectives. I had a premonition he was going to pass. I also had a dream about him with my mom that makes sense in light of her failing health now. I was really close to my brother &amp; dearly miss him. \n\nAt the time of his passing I was also caring for my fil who had dementia. \n\nNow. \n\nOne night, after my brother passed,  my fil was coming in the door &amp; for a second or two I literally saw my brother standing there looking at me smiling. Then it was my fil again. I was unsettled to say the least. My husband said I turned white as a sheet &amp; asked me what's wrong.\n\nMy fil passed within a few months of that experience. He and my brother never met in life.\n\nFast forward to present day. My mom is frail &amp; not in good health. Her decline started in May of this year when she nearly died. She recovered then started declining again. I stayed in the hospital with her the whole time...3mos. I saw a man leaving the hospital one morning as I was returning &amp; he kept staring at me. As I got closer he looked just like my brother...just gave me his look as he kept walking away. My hair stood up on my neck. \n\nSince that time I've moved my mother a few states away from her home into mine so I can care for her &amp; this continues! Most recently I saw my brother walking down the hall at a physician office...only this time when he got closer it was like the experience with my fil &amp; it wasn't my brother anymore. Like he imposed himself in someone for me to see?? \n\nDoes this have a name? \nI don't even know what to call it to start researching it...",

        "text": "One night a while back my uncle got his very first GPS &amp; wanted to see how on point the directions would be so he asked me if I wanted to go for a ride &amp; I was all for it. He then said that we should pick a place we have never been to before to see if it gets us there without any problems, so me being so into the paranormal and living in New Jersey I right away suggested a weird NJ/paranormal spot &amp; he was totally down. After a bit of Google searches I found a place called Greystone Park psychiatric hospital which had the abandoned hospital from 1871 &amp; and the newly built one just a little ways down, they also had an abandoned firestation as well as a new one which were also separated a little ways away from each other. We went at night (of course because is there a better time to go to such a place?) And once we arrived the first thing we see is a firestation up &amp; running. We take a turn in towards the firestation  to see the garage door open with the firetruck right inside with the lights on and looks fairly new with a man dressed in regular clothes standings 6 ft from the firestation. Our first thought was to make a U-turn and get out of there before police get called because we're there at night and they might know that we're coming to go see the abandoned mental asylum, but then we realize the man isn't looking at us but looking straight &amp; his eyes never move but we thought nothing of it. We decided we didn't want any problems so we would just leave and come back the next day with my ex boyfriend at the time &amp; my mom, plus then we can get a better look at things once we find the abandoned portion of everything. Skip to the next day where me and my uncle get my ex bf &amp; my mom to agree to the trip to see greystone asylum.....Now this is where things got sketchy QUICKLY! We get there and the first thing we see is an old run down firestation to where my uncle jams on the brakes &amp; turns to me &amp; at the same time we say \"NO F**KIN WAY!!!\", my mom &amp; ex are now super confused and keep asking us what a million times to where we don't respond but are in complete shock. I told my uncle to drive up because I needed to get out of the car &amp; get an up close look for myself just to see layers of dust within the insides, things thrown around as if people just took off running out of there in complete chaos right before they shut this old firehouses doors, buckets &amp; paperwork thrown everywhere, no firetruck even in the garage, &amp; just completely old &amp; ran down. I went back to the car to explain to my uncle what I saw &amp; then we told my ex and my mom what had happened the night before so we decided to drive around to see the actual abandoned asylum and what not only to find out the NEW firestation was indeed not where the one we had seen from the night before was at all, the one we had seen was the abandoned one.\nTo this day we still don't know what happened that night &amp; are left with SOOOOOO MANY questions, did we witness a residual haunting? Was that man just doing what he loved the most while he was still alive? Why were we able to see what it once looked like? \nQuestions that we unfortunately will NEVER have answers to especially since they demolished those buildings in 2015, but man was this place BEAUTIFUL!!",

However, it still shouldn't look like this. When there's enough moisture in the air to reflect off of clouds like the bat signal, you can see the rest of the beam. This was just a dinner plate sized light disk in the air. It moved to the right for about five seconds, and then pulled a U turn much faster in the other direction.

        "text": "Hello, first post here!\n\nRecently my (ex) step dad passed away (still very much a part of our lives and family regardless of title), the day after we found him (wellness check after being unable to get ahold of him for holiday plans) we had plans to meet with a funeral home to make arrangements for him. While getting ready, I was in my bedroom and caught the lingering smell of him - not just his cologne (if that makes any sense). I could identify it immediately and quickly walked out of my room, having second thoughts I went back into the room and could no longer smell it. This has happened a few times in odd places, usually while I’m executing tasks related to putting him to rest or taking care of his last wishes. \n\nAnother strange occurrence I experienced was at his apartment. I had just arrived and had gone into his bedroom closet to pick out an old shirt to wear while I cleaned. While in the closet I heard a sudden rhythmic tapping, I poked my head out of the closet and saw his bedroom door slightly swinging back and forth enough to tap the wall behind it. This was in a fashion was was consistent with it being manipulated - consistent and unchanging in speed or force. I had to reach out and grab the door to stop it. I have been in his apartment several times since he passed away, this was the first time I was there alone and the only time I have witnessed that door move in that manor. I tried to replicate it by walking quickly past the door, lightly bumping it when walking past, and turning on the heat/fan to see if blowing would cause the door to move without success. \n\nI want to believe that this is him letting me know he’s around, but remaining skeptical. My mom and I have both made a habit of talking to him now while we clean or are in the apartment - cracking jokes at him like we would in life. Specifically we make a note of asking him to help us find things, such as the key to his gun safe so we can give his forearms to his nephew per his will. \n\nJust wanted to share my recent experiences and see if anyone else has had similar experiences, advice or warnings for me?",

        "text": "I think I posted this occurrence some time ago, but I'd like to get more insight as to what was going on.  I (male) was 5 years old 42 years ago...  I didn't know anything about the paranormal.\n\nMy mom was going into labor with my younger brother so Mom &amp; Dad had me stay at my grandparents for a couple days that happened to be over Christmas.  Christmas morning was great!  I still remember their silver, vintage aluminum Christmas tree and the Crayola Caddy that I unwrapped and had SOOOO wanted!\n\nThat night something strange and terrifying happened....\n\nI shared a (queen) bed with my grandfather.  Side note, there were two bedrooms and my grandparents already slept in separate rooms for years (snoring?).  I was woken in the middle of the night to the bed VIOLENTLY shaking!  To give a sense of the intensity, imagine the 4 legs of the bed were each sitting in industrial paint can mixers - synced up, turned on high.\n\nI had no idea what was going on!  I was scared to death!  My grandfather, however, was still sleeping through this.  I tried desperately to shake him awake.  Finally, he started to stir awake and INSTANTLY the bed stopped still!  I asked him, \"Grandpa!  What was making the bed shake?!  Why was the bed shaking?!\"\n\nGroggily, he had no idea what I was talking about and said, \"The bed's not shaking.  Go back to sleep.\"  He turned back over and was snoring again in seconds.   My adrenaline was jacked and I was in no way falling back asleep anytime.  I just sat there.  In the dark.  In the silence.\n\nThere was ambient light from the outside that dimly lit the room.  The bedroom door was open (which it normally was).  If at the foot of the bed, you could look out the bedroom doorway, down the hall and into the front room where the Christmas tree was.\n\nI sat up at the edge of the bed to look at the tree.  As a little kids, Christmas trees give us a sense of comfort.  As I looked at that tree - probably 30 ft away, I could see something was different.\n\nNow sitting beside the tree was the silhouette/shadow shape of a HUGE doberman dog.  By huge, I mean sitting on its haunches still being over 5ft tall.  It just stared at me.  No movement.  No sound.\n\nIt scared me!  I hid under the covers and eventually fell asleep.  Woke up to a beautiful sunny winter morning.\n\nNow nothing paranormal ever happened in that house again (to my knowledge).  However, my grandfather would certainly turn out to be a complete monster.  He went on to molest his grandchildren (including me, starting months later), he was always terribly verbally abusive to my grandma, and was terribly physically abusive to my father &amp; uncle when they were kids.  Both of those grandparents have long since passed.\n\nI often wonder if there was a connection b/t this demonic?/poltergeist activity and him.  Did the activity cause him to act awful to his grandchildren?  Or did he (already a terrible person) somehow unknowingly manifest the activity, himself?  If you have insight to beds violently shaking or huge, dark shadow dogs/dobies, I'd appreciate it.\n\nTo note, this occurred likely right when my brother was actually being born a mile or two away (3am local Dec 26, 1980)...  And maybe 6 hours after the Rendlesham Forest incident that happened thousands of miles away in England (3am local Dec 26, 1980)...  Unsure if these events are purely coincidental.",

        "text": "My intuition has never been wrong, even since I was a kid. I always knew when someone was lying, when something was wrong, and I could even explain like concepts that I never researched because I thought it was just \"common sense\" (turns out, a lot of it wasn't common sense). But there are three recent instances that made me think about talking to somebody and I wanna know if yall think it's worth it. \n\n1. Boyband BTS announced a break from group activities earlier this year and had a concert in October. I immediately felt something was wrong and documented it on snapchat with the caption \"12:58AM, October 8, 2022. I just got a bad feeling about BTS. Trying to see if I'm a WITCH.\" I was kind of joking about the WITCH thing, but I was genuinely curious if I was overthinkimg stuff. A week later, they announced that they were all going to the military and would return in 2025. If you don't know, South Korean men must enlist in the military before they turn 30, and their oldest member turns 30 next month. It's was a whole ordeal, but no one thought they were gonna go, but I just felt it in my BONES that something was up and I was right.\n\n2. I was on Chatroulette with a friend and the guy we were talking to said his wife was African. I said aloud \"She's Moroccan.\" Idk why, but Moroccan just came to me. My friend asked him what ethnicity she was and he said, \"Moroccan.\" She looked at me and we literally both started screaming (I'm not overexaggerating, we're just dramatic people, lol). We screamed bc not only was I right, but it wasn't my first time doing something like that. She has always joked that I could be a witch. (Key word: joked. We know witchcraft is serious)\n\n3. I was on Chatroulette again with two other friends a day or so later. This Somalian guy came up and we all introduced ourselves. I got a bad feeling for some reason and became disinterested really fast. I asked my friend, \"Does he seem like one of those Africans that bash Black Americans for saying we're from America and not a country in Africa?\" (YES, THAT'S A THING. Black people call it diaspora wars and it honestly sucks). My friend said, \"What? No, he seems nice.\" They continue talking to him, but i get on my phone and wait out the conversation. He then starts 1. Ignoring my African American friend and 2. Bashing my Ethiopian friend for not being a \"real African\" and not knowing her \"heritage\" because she was born in America, not Ethiopia. She immediately skips him and both of them look at me with wide eyes. I called it. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Lucky guesses, strong intuition, or more?\n\nTLDR; Three events happen that got me questioning if my intuition is crazy good or if it's more. I had a feeling that BTS was hiding the fact that they were enlisting in the military, I knew a stranger's wife was Moroccan after only being told that she was African and never seeing her, I knew that a guy was a Bigot after only exchanging names. Other things have happened before, but these are just recent events.",

So i have a question  did anybody ever hear a shadow figure talk? Did a shadow figure ever had physical contact with anybody? If yes then what did it say? What did it do?",

        "text": "This is going to be a strange one, but this is the best place I can think of to try getting answers.  Apologies if the flair is not quite accurate.  As a disclaimer, this is not a piece of fiction.  I just tend to write in a narrative style.\n\nEver since I was very young, I have had these…for lack of a better word, I’ll call them visions.  They always start the same.  I begin to feel this sense of epiphany - as if I am incredibly close to finding some fundamental truth about the universe.  But this excitement is soon overshadowed by an awful, nameless fear, until suddenly something changes.  \n\nI see this image in my mind’s eye, one that’s haunted me all my life.  A endless plain of dust, as far as the eye can see, under a sickly sky.  Breaking the horizon, there is a cluster of imposing black monoliths, connected by a forest of black wires.  The world is silent, except for the humming of wires and the howl of wind through the monoliths, which has always sounded like singing to me.  \n\nI am overcome with this inexplicable terror, which breaks the image and pulls me out.  After they end, I never remember what caused me to have that revelation in the first place, but I am left with this strange sense of sudden understanding. \n\n\nFor a long I’ve been content to dismiss this as overactive childhood imagination, however as I’ve grown up these experiences have continued, each leaving me with some strange piece of knowledge.  Then I began seeing small, but noticeable pieces of that world I saw reflected in the works of others, seeming too specific to be coincidental.  Cities of black monoliths, nests of humming wires, even a story which described a “dead clockwork world”.  A lot more of these exist, but they are too difficult to explain from the limited summary here.  \n\nWhat really prompted me to try and learn more was when I was talking to a friend, and discovered he had dreamed of the exact same place.  I had never once talked about this with him before, or even mentioned similar ideas.  It was just the exact same world, down to even the sound and emotions associated.  He described it as “fear of a concept”.  \n\nThis mystery has haunted me for my entire life, and I’m looking for answers.  Is there anyone out there with similar experiences?  Most reading this will see it as nonsense, but if you’ve seen the city of wires, you’ll understand.",

        "text": "I was getting ready to head out for the day. My girlfriend was sitting in bed. We live in a small one-bedroom apartment. I was facing my girlfriend with my back to the bathroom. We both heard, clear as day, the voice of a young woman say “sup?” at the same time. It sounded like she was a couple feet behind me, in the room with us (didnt sound like it was coming from a neighbor’s apartment at all). She didn’t sound like she was yelling or anything, just a casual “sup” like someone would say when you walked into a room they were sitting in. I whipped around, and nobody was there. The sound did not come from a device such as a phone/laptop/tv etc. \n\nBefore I said anything about the gender of the voice, my girlfriend said “it sounded like a girl, right?” So I know we heard the same thing.\n\nI know this is probably not an incredibly exciting story, but I cannot come up with an explanation for the life of me. I guess maybe a voice from upstairs could’ve travelled through the vents, but it really felt like this voice was right behind me. There wasn’t any muffling of the voice, no reverberation, no echo, nothing that would indicate there wasn’t a person right behind me until I turned around. I’ve never had a paranormal experience in my life, at least not one that felt so real and with such a lack of an explanation. When my girlfriend described what she heard, and it matched what I heard perfectly, I got chills that I’ve never felt before. Any ideas?",

        "text": "So I’ve had a lot of experiences, not sure if it’s due to me being Native American or not but most people I meet haven’t even experienced one paranormal activity while for me it’s pretty normal since I was a child. I just started posting my true non exaggerated experiences, so far only posting two of them and have already received a bunch of hate on how I write and how fake my stories sound. So I know for sure you guys really won’t believe this one but it doesn’t matter to me if you believe or not. What matters is I get my experiences out and for the few who will. This is by far the scariest thing I’ve ever had happen to me in my entire life. I felt as though I was in a movie it was so unreal but actually happened to me and my preteen daughter. \nSo this happened in a part of Oklahoma that has dirt roads and no city life not even street lights where I was. I had to go to work (was able to bring my daughter w/me on nightshift) and my son wanted to stay at his friends out in the boondocks (middle of nowhere) so me n her just got done dropping him off. I’m going 40 on a dirt road (can’t go too fast or you will fishtail your vehicle off the road) but didn’t want to be late so was already going fast as I could responsibly. I had my brights on and my window down. Not even house lights were on, it was about 1130 at night. Pitch black. Up ahead in the distance I seen dirt suspended in the air in just a small certain area in the road and told my daughter that was weird. Cause there were no other vehicles ahead of me or none that just passed by. When I got to that area not thinking nothing of it no more, I heard a very loud deep growl and at the same time I FELT  breath hit my neck from the driver window side, I immediately looked and seen something that scared me so bad I looked straight back ahead, hit the gas pedal and started praying in my head, I didn’t want to freak my daughter out, she was sitting in the back seat, but I knew she seen it cause she didn’t ask me what’s wrong to why I was driving so crazy to get away. The whole time I’m fleeing I can hear it chasing us and that scary ass deep growl and I drive as fast as I can till I finally hit a hwy but the whole time I was trying to think to myself, what was that cause I seen it clear as day, it was not a dog for sure, it wasn’t a wolf because of the size but that’s what it kind of resembled. I drove a dodge nitro at the time which is kind of like a jeep. That thing was as big as my vehicle. When I felt it breathe on me and I looked at it it was right next to me level headed and already in chase mode but the look on its face I’ll never forget. It resembled a wolf, but was big like a polar bear, all white, except it’s gums and eyes were red as the devil. And was bearing its bright white teeth at me like it was smiling bc it was scaring me, playing with me in an evil way. For me to see it and feel it and know it was not normal and something very sinister, it was the most scariest thing ever. So when I felt far enough to drive normal and was on the regular lit up highway I asked my daughter to see what perspective she had n said lala what was that?! She said momma that was a Demon. \nOther things DO exist. I think we were just at the wrong place at the right time. I’ve also seen skin walkers which were scary but not like this bc they didn’t chase me. I will post on that experience as well.",

Everytime I go in there, every feeling I get just changes. It feels unsafe in there and it always feels like something is in there with me. I'm scared tbh. Idk if maybe me being weak is letting it get to me. It just keeps getting worse. Last night, power to my room went out for a bit. Only my room. When it came back on, there was a figure in my room. Just as quickly as I saw it, it disappeared. It always feels more and more negative.... And a little evil in my room specifically whenever I'm going though a bad like depressive episode. Idk how to get rid of it, and it's always around me. I just don't want it to get worse. My mom said it's probably getting stronger, which I could believe. If it's anything evil, I'm scared of what could happen. Does anyone have any advice or anything?",

        "text": "Hello I am 19 years old, spent my life in USA. Raised Catholic but in middle school I lost my faith and since then have been an atheist.\n\nwhoever recently I started looking into bizarre things in the world more so out of curiosity. Then I started to really catch my eye was language and its effect on our DNA, it seems so random that something core to us can be subtlety changed by a skill. Then the fact that people who have taken hallucinogenics like LSD experience geometric patterns and people on DMT report elves then that had weird implications doesn't it?\n\nSo, now I'm very interested in what else there is. See, 80% of the stuff I looked into is either unfounded or easy to explain, to be fair in like 40% of that 80 there was something weird and interesting buried underneath the junk. So I'm tired of dead ends and wastes of my time.\n\n\nThat's where you come in. \n\nI would love supernatural stories where everything just lines up, or phenomenon that happen to completely unrelated people, or whatever convinced you that the phenomenal is a thing.\n\nI will be active in the comments so prepare for replies.",
