        "text": "Hey AskNetsec-ians,\n\nI just acquired my Sec+ (yay!) and got a job as a SOC Analyst I (double yay). I wanted some more experience users 2 cents on the path I was going to take.\n\nCurrently at my company they sponsor you to go after additional certifications and I put in a request for them to sponsor me for the OSCP. I know I want to get into pen-testing because right now, I find it extremely interesting, and I know for pentesters the OSCP/GPEN is the way to go. I chose the OSCP because it seems to be a bit more respected within the pentesting community. However, being a SOC Analyst I and new to the company, I'm not too sure if they will grant me the sponsorship for the OSCP. \n\n\n1. Because i'm new to the company still.\n \n2. Because the OSCP is not a certificate that would really help me as a SOC Analyst. *(I mean technically it could, but i'm sure there are other certifications that could be much more helpful.)*\n\n\nIf that falls through and they deny me because of reason #2, then I was thinking of trying for the CASP/GCIH*(Preferably the CASP)* I feel like that looks better in comparison to the GCIH, it's seems to be the more advanced certification of the two - please feel free to weigh in on that opinion.\n\nHowever, if they deny me because of #1, because those two certs are too expensive and don't want to invest that much money in me since i'm still new, i'll probably go after the OSCP and just try and pay for it myself... Hopefully I won't have to.\n\nNow before I continue on, let me state that I have a strong fundamental knowledge of networking and don't really want to waste my money on getting the CCENT/CCNA/Net+. I have taken the CCNAI/II course at my college and passed with A's in both. I'm pretty comfortable with subnetting and knowing now networks run, at least at the fundamental level. \n\nAdditionally, I have taken a CEH course at a different college because they were the only ones offering it and have immensely enjoyed it. I'm not the greatest and Linux, but I know how to use it enough and know how to navigate it to do basic port scans using nmap, and some other tools. (metasploit, burpsuite, jack) I'm by no means an expert, but my teacher highly encouraged me to go after the OSCP after this semester. He did warn me of how difficult it would be and the amount of time I would have to invest to learn the stuff, but i'm quite confident I have the motivation AND discipline to get through the course.\n\nI would like to request the wisdom of the elders on this subreddit in their 2 cents on this matter. \n\n**TL;DR** - I am a SOC Analyst 1. I want to go OSCP, but am unsure if company will sponser me. If they don't, I will try for CASP/GCIH, and if they don't do that, i'll try and get money to pay for my own OSCP. \n\n\n",

My bank / email? different story, of course. But still.\n\nEither way, i always liked the convenince of having a few different password-ish variations that i'd use around, meaning i could always either remember or guessforce a password whenever i forgot it. However more and more i seem to think that perhaps its finally time i started using one of those \"password storage\" apps.\n\nNow, am i correct in understanding that those apps basically generate a \"hard-to-remember-or-guess\" password strings (like xhDas7FssudHbgASD7sf) that are unique for each site, and only stored locked via a single password? If so, isn't it a hassle to constantly have to bring up the app to check the password? And if you're out somewhere overseas and dont have your PC with you, you're screwed?\n\nAlso, isnt having a single breakable point a massive bad thing? Breaking a password program would mean gaining access to **everything**? (Note: i am asking as someone who doesnt do netsec or any sec really, basically a layman). \n\nCould anyone please help me figure this out, and also recommend a good program to use for this? I remember there's been some scandals and news about some program being hacked or not secure or whatever. What is the \"recommended\" thing to use right now in 2018?\n\nMany thanks!",

However, almost no organizations (at least that I interacted with) accepted this 'challenge' as proof of ownership, but opted for the 'sender' verification instead.\n\nOn the other hand, when performing automated tasks (like password resets or account set-up completion) usually the challenge method is used. I have the feeling, however, that this is because it is simpler to implement and not due to security concerns.\n\nWhich of the two options for verifying ownership of an e-mail address is better, and why? And should either one of the option not be used at all?\n\nI can't seem to find anything about this. That means that either I'm gravely overlooking something (maybe even just a simple search term).\n\n---\nEdit (May 9, 18:22): A few comments ask if there is a specific use case. I did not have one in mind when posting the question because I was looking to learn if there was any good practice for the generic fact of figuring out whether someone 'owns' an e-mail address. \n\nLooking at the replies that have been posted as of yet, I think this discussion is more about manual verification rather than automatic verification (password resets, for example, already usually verify ownership of an account/e-mail address by sending a challenge). When I look at cases in which I would have had my e-mail address ownership verified I see they are also mostly manual verifications: non-automated account deletion (so, send an e-mail to support to delete your account), requesting info related to an account that was not accessible within an interface.\n\nAnother interesting use case would be verifying whether someone is a student. In my experience, I usually have to supply my student e-mail address that I got from my university and then receive a challenge on it. In this case there is no proving ownership of an account with a service, but proving a certain status that is associated with an e-mail address you may (not) control. My university does not employ any SPF/DMARC requirements on their student e-mail domain, so the sender verification would be pretty useless there.",

Our AD domain uses password complexity requirements and a minimum length of 9 characters. This has resulted in most users having terrible passwords like \"Mydogfluffy1\",etc,etc. \nWe have a 2003 domain with 4 DCs.\n\nI followed [this guide](https://www.swordshield.com/2015/07/getting-hashes-from-ntds-dit-file/) I exported the hashes to john the ripper format. \n\nI used john with the rockyou wordlist and default ruleset to crack the LM hashes, then followed [these instructions](http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2006/07/08/2) to use the LM hashes to help crack the NT hashes. \n\njohn cracked 1189 of 1663 LM hashes in a matter of minutes. Using the modified word/rule list against NT hashes, it found 420 passwords in a matter of hours. This was on a 2 core VM with 1GB of RAM and minimal virtual graphics. \n\n\nHere are my dumb questions: \n\n\n1) How do I know when john is done cracking? Previously, I used john against the NT hashes without the LM support. This resulted in john running for days and days and me terminating it after two weeks' time. This time, it seemed to stop at some point with the LM hashes and then stop fairly quickly on the NT hashes. ~.john/john.pot shows a last write time of only a few hours after I started it. ps aux | grep john implies that the john process has ended for those hash files. \n\n2) How accurate of a metric is this for how \"good\" users' passwords are? For instance, passwords like Dictionaryword45 are more common and thus \"worse\", but we did have a few ostensibly \"better\" passwords like Dictionaryword12notarealword8 get cracked. \n\n3) The above audit technique--grabbing a copy of ntds.dit and extracting the hashes, then doing a hash comparison--is a worst-case scenario. We lock accounts out after 6 failed login attempts. As terrible as most of the recovered passwords are, only a few use our company name or major sports team names, and I'd honestly be surprised if any of these accounts could be compromised from the outside. How should I gauge this risk?\n",

        "text": "So today my girlfriend had upgraded her internet and got a new router (Sagemcom F@st 5260) and asked for help setting some things up.. I have been using a pfsense build for a while am a little bit out of the loop on commercial routers used by ISPs. But I saw some insane settings. \n\nFirst, the router had options for connecting to the webGUI via port 443 and 80. The default setting is to allow 80 and 443 for wired connections but only port 443 for wireless connections. I cannot figure out the logic to this because if you allow any traffic on port 80 with HTTP protocol, it will be sniff-able despite if the source of the traffic is wired or not. So why only allow port 80 for wired connections as default?  \n\nAnyway, when I turned off the webGUI on 80 option, I could not get access despite using \"https://\" or appending with \":443\". I could, however, get the login page to come using http, although it would not authenticate when using the correct credentials. Weird that it allows access to the webGUI login page on http and for you to submit credentials when I disabled port 80. So, I guess it wouldn't save you from sniff-based attacks even if http is disabled, if someone attempts to login on http. The only other thing I did was reset the gateway option, which I did because I thought it would reset the states. (I do not think this resets any settings because there was also a reset factory settings option, but please set me straight if I am missing something here). Eventually I had to reset to factory to just log in. Any idea what was going on here? My conclusion was just that the software was buggy, and the extremely long gateway reset messed something up. Because I was able to login once on https after trusting the self-signed CA.\n\nSecond there was a default setting to allow you to access the router remotely (again via http).\n\nThird the default firewall setting was \"low\" which was allow all on LAN and ALLOW ALL ON WAN! The medium was the same but only blocked NETBIOS on WAN. Are settings like this really common? At least the high setting blocked all incoming WAN traffic. Like I have said I have not worked with these routers in years but what the heck are these default settings?! Is this insane as it sounds to me or have I just been wearing a tin-foil hat for too long?",

I know my (current/past) work can monitor what I do on my work computer, but can they see everything I see?  For instance, can they see me type in my banking information?\n\n2. If I bring in my personal laptop and connect to their guest or hidden password-protected Wi-Fi, how much access do they have to my computer?  I'm aware they can see what websites I visit, but if I was reading a Facebook message, can they see that too?\n\n3. Is there any detecting software that would alert me if my private computer is being monitored?\n\nI'm just thinking that if that guy likes to illegally break into computers, he must love nosing around in computers he's \"allowed\" to monitor.\n\nThanks!\n",

It has no connectivity to any network, so I'm confused as to how it knows. Is there some sort of special message sent out from my host that tries to locate Echo devices in setup mode? I'm wondering this because if there is some sort of special message sent out, I see this as a potential attack vector. As an attacker, couldn't you theoretically listen for this special message, then advertise your own fake network that the user connects to?",

I have some basic knowledge in Python.\n\nSo far I have tried to search on any topics related to information security or penetration testing and I keep looking at vague definitions and nothing is clearly specified. My real questions are:\n\n1.What exactly defines Penetration testing and what all does it cover? Does it come under information security or is it completely different?\n\n2.How do I get a job related to this and any sort of experience? I read about CTF and some basic linux knowledge and certificates (like OSCP?) but where to start exactly and what kind of experience should I get exactly?\n\n3.What is a career path like for such a job and where should I see myself ending up later on in life?\n\n4.Any other tips or resources that I can look into that will help me understand this better\n\nI am sry if it seems like I'm asking to be spoonfed but I am in a really confused state and am asking this for clarity. I really want to make a decision soon but I don't think I have enough information at hand to make that. Some ppl pointed out that I am looking more short term instead of long term as far as career planning goes and so would like some help in understanding exactly what a career as a penetration tester looks like and how far up the ladder you can climb.",

As I've begun to study and learn more about the field my original plan of gaining some certs (network+ and OSCP), doing a shit-ton of work in virtual labs/CTF's and then immediatley getting a job in security seems unrealistic. I'm coming to you fine folks in the midst of my confusion in the hopes that you can help me design a career path! My primary focus is to be doing 100% remote work. If you think there is something better I could be pursuing in the tech field I would be fine with potentially changing course depending on the direction and the argument presented.\n\n\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n\n\n**Obtain 100% remote work**\n\n-I am legally able to work in either the U.S. or Canada, I am also willing     to travel for work although preferrably less than 25%\n\n**Salary 50-70k (USD)**\n\n-In my current location I can live like a king on 70k so I'd be very comfortable starting around 50K\n\n**Avoiding more formal education**\n\n-I would prefer to take certifications and building an excellent portfolio of projects in order to more officially demonstrate competence\n\n\n\n**Current Tech specific Education &amp; Experience**\n\n-None, I did pursue some programming courses when I completed my business degree but didn't switch to compsci because I felt I wasn't math savvy enough\n\n-I have some familiarity with Visual Basic, Python, Java and Javascript.\n\n\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. If you had one year to become proficient in security what would you do? (not an actual time line)\n\n2. If you could pick 3 key skills to master above all others what would they be?\n\n3. I've read lots of posts suggesting that security is not an entry-level field. What are some good entry-level positions for those interested? What are some positions to avoid?\n\n4. What is something that security experts are very proficient at?\n\n5. What technical skill do security experts often neglect?\n\n6. What do those at the pinnacle still work to improve on? (outside of keeping up to date in the latest technologies)\n\nEdited for formatting",

At this job I've spent the last 3 years as a \"DevOps Engineer\" but the reality was my duties were more along the lines of a cloud systems engineer with little time spent on things like automation. As we grew my role also started to encompass any general IT tasks as well as a large amount of IT Security related things like risk assessments, policy, security engineering, etc.\n\nWe've grown to the point where I can now specialize. I could move to focus more on DevOps and Cloud Engineering or I could move to focus more on IT Security. In about a year I'll be eligible to take the CISSP and on the other side we have a number of exciting initiatives in DevOps/Engineering that would enable me to build a lot of new skills.\n\nIn favor of DevOps I enjoy building things, learning new technologies and solving problems in the engineering side. I also enjoy being able to work on a single task/project until it's done.\n\nAgainst DevOps I sometimes feel I'm not as adept at others at figuring out and using new technologies. I also have a great deal less development experience than others I've met in the field.\n\nIn favor for IT security I enjoyed speaking with customers in an almost sales role. I like meeting with lawyers and consultants to help craft policy or assist our leadership in making decisions. I also think I have a very detail oriented approach that has been well suited to finding flaws or locking down every vector of attack to a system.\n\nAgainst IT Security is I'm finding it involves juggling a number of concurrent tasks and a lot of project management. I've found that very difficult at times. Also I really don't like being the \"enforcer\" when it comes to rules, policies, and practices. Finally I find it to be very stressful and sometimes opine for the days of just writing code.\n\nI know from above it sounds like I enjoy DevOps more but I'm really split as to which I prefer. Does anyone have any thoughts on which field they think is a better career choice? Anyone have to make this decision or one like it at some point in their career? I'm looking for advice and experiences that will help me decide. Thanks.",

It has a record, and, I went through all of it, does not contain 41.147.39.237.  One thing to note is that it has a neutral policy for any unmatched IPs.  Why, then, does the header state \"myuniversity.edu does not designate permitted sender hosts\"?  I don't understand why the header shows that an SPF record doesn't exist, while I can quickly find it online with a number of lookup tools.  Thanks!",

If I put a VPN up and route DNS requests through it, it returns as expected. If I use [DNS Traceroute](https://github.com/farrokhi/dnsdiag#dnstraceroute) I'm always 1 hop from a DNS server (I live in the country...), and if I throw in random IPs as DNS servers it always returns as if I'm 1 hop away even though it wasn't an actual DNS server.\n\nI setup DNS over TLS, but that did not seem to stop the interception, even though queries are being sent via TLS.\n\nHow can I stop my ISP from intercepting my DNS requests? Is there anything I can do short of sending queries through a VPN?\n\n**Edit:** Tried to see if I could see if the dns traffic is being redirected. `traceroute 8.8.8.8` shows the hops I would expect. `traceroute -U 8.8.8.8` shows one hop (to my router) then timeouts/rejections immediately for the max of 30 hops. Not sure if that's any indication?\n\n**Edit2:** DNS over TLS doesn't seem to be working, that aside, I opted to just setup a VPN for just DNS traffic. There didn't seem to be alternatives. I would like to figure out why Unbound isn't using tls even though it's setup for it...\n\n**Edit3:** I got an IP address form them that doesn't go through their carrier-grade-nat, and all dns issues are resolved. What where they doing behind their nat with dns requests??",

This includes finally getting cyber liability insurance, ensuring GDPR compliance (not worried about the deadline-we're tiny and should be fine, just want to have policies and checks in place for the future), and make it so that our yearly PCI self assessment is actually accurate.\n\nI need someone who can take a look at what we have (no real security policy documentation or controls), help us draft policies, documentation, etc., and make sure that we're on the right track. Maybe help us write out the reasoning for things where we need exceptions, or assist with figuring out how to get to an accepted configuration.\n\nNow for the tricky part, I'm really hoping that I can get this done in the $10-20k range, and without on-site visits, or at least without more than one. Is that possible? We're a small non-profit (~150 employees). We have a few semi-independent offices across the country (all included in that ~150 number), and I know that multiple site visits are going to make this unaffordable. Is that the right range? If not, what range should I be preparing for?\n\nI know there are hundred of firms out there that offer some sort of cyber-security services, but while every MSP lists it, I wouldn't trust 99% of them to know any more than I do. I also don't need someone to run nmap scans and print them out. I've asked some people for recommendations, but everyone I've asked either has their own security teams (and therefore don't know) or have never done anything of the sort.\n\nHow do I find what I'm looking for, and am I at all in the right ballpark price wise?\n\nTL;DR: How do I find a \"good\" company to assist with a cyber security assessment and help with the creation of policy and documentation, and what price should I be paying for a non-profit with ~150 employees?\n\nThanks.",
