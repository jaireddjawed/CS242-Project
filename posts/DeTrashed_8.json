        "text": "I always pick up rubbish on my walks through the park, every day or second day. It's a habit of mine -- I just can't walk past a piece of rubbish and *not* pick it up, especially if it's in this beautiful park near my home. \n\nThe park is the only refuge I have where I can the traffic, the scent of gasoline, the loud noises and the all-around suburban ambiance that constantly leaves me stressed out and exhausted. I know it's not the best park, but just about every time I walk through that park splitting through the center, I feel like everything slows down and I'm in this little Utopian sandbox bubble; it's a place where I can just sit down, breathe, and *be*. \n\nBut of course, no matter how many bins there are, people will always litter there. Even despite the fact that our city prides itself on its beautiful gardens &amp; parks, I always find rubbish on my walks. I suppose it's not too bad, but I aspire to be a better person and picking up the rubbish in this little refuge of mine is the best starting point. \n\nSo it was nice to have two ladies run after me and stop to tell me that I was doing a good thing. They even hugged me. It was a little embarrassing, surreal even. But it was nice. I have fairly bad anxiety so I often want to just keep to myself, but I handled it fairly well and it's reassured me that I'm probably on the right track to becoming a better person. \n\nThanks for reading; I don't really have anybody else to share this to, but it was such a highlight to me that I just wanted to share it to *somebody*.",

Way too much for me to deal with. So I called the city and complained and viola - the mess was gone three days later.\n\nKeep up the good work, but just note one call can do way more work that you can do with just a bag and moxie. ",

I’d like to share a story with you about the power of leading by example, with a bit of back story as well. \n\nA few friends and I were going on a walk at Cape Reinga in New Zealand. This is where the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman sea meet-and it’s INCREDIBLE. It’s become a huge tourist destination, but it’s also a sacred ground to the Maori people. According to their myths it’s where the dead jump off of the earth and fly on into the afterlife. Its about a mile walk down to the point from the parking lot, and there are markers up all along the way explaining the stories and cultural significance of the Cape. \nYou would think that knowing how important this place is-and how lucky we are to be allowed to view it-would be a deterrence from littering, but that most certainly was not the case. Walking down we were commenting on how sad the disrespect was, but we didn’t have a way of holding onto any litter. But as we were starting the walk up, we were lucky enough to find a grocery bag that had been left by someone else (lucky is a loose term for that, I guess) and all along the way back we filled it. \nWhen people walking towards us would see what we were doing, almost everyone would  start to look around their feet and pick up anything they passed until they got to us and tossed it in our bag. And everyone that contributed said “thank you”. There were even a few groups of people that would stop and scour with us until we’d gotten everything within reach in the area! It was an AWESOME feeling seeing everyone come together, and relizing more people cared than we originally thought. \nOne of the best parts, however, was when we left the cape we went to these sand dune about an hour away. When we got out and started walking to the dunes, we passed one of the groups that had stopped and helped us at the cape getting back to their car. They had brought a bag with them and it was almost full! We stopped and chatted for a bit, and they told us that we had inspired them to pick up here as well. \n\nIt just goes to show-you might pick up one piece of litter, but someone could see you and pick up one as well...and the chain keeps going. \n(Also, I’ve learned-always have a spare bag.)\n\nThanks!",
