I was dumbfounded when I was told this because this guy was a *horrible* student up until he went for his masters. He went to a public university in the Northeast (U.S.) *barely* completing an English BA at a school that was mostly  STEM majors. During this time, he never volunteered or joined clubs/associations as he also managed to get off 2x for plagiarizing in his English classes (the first time was at a community college). The schools never put the plagiarizing situations on his record, instead they let him off with a one-time warning. Fast forward...he graduated with his BA in English (5 years total) and with a 2.9 GPA. When there was a house party a couple of months ago, we were catching up on life (both of us) and he told me his GRE scores. The only reason I remember them was because they're pretty much identical to the ones I got:\n\nVerbal Reasoning- 149 (43rd percentile).\n\nQuantative Reasoning- 139 (6th percentile).\n\nAnalytical Writing- 4.0 (60th percentile). \n\n***NOTE:*** The scores above are mine and only mine but this kid very similar scores.\n\nI haven't seen this guy in about a year and some months now, but I know for a fact that he's going to Yale for a PhD in English. I'm assuming that he got his masters in English as well but can't for the life of me figure out how the hell he got into such a school???? \n\nAfter my friend confirmed that this guy was going to Yale, I felt like there might be *some* hope for me getting into an Ivy when the time comes to apply for a PhD. I mean, if this guy could get in, why cant I?\n\nI graduated with a BA in English from a reputable public college in NY with a GPA of 3.48. Hadn't I fucked up one year upstate, I would've finished my BA with a 3.78 GPA. While going to school, I worked for 3 1/2 years and joined some clubs and became the secretary of the Women's Student Association (IDK if this is really important). I'm currently taking my first course (summer class) towards my masters in English Secondary Ed and plan (maybe) to apply for a PhD program in English. There is no guarantee in *anything* we do and the same goes for applying to colleges, *I know this.* I'm posting this story on here in hopes that people could let me know what my chances are of getting into any Ivy for a PhD in English. Don't worry, I won't quote any of you!!!  I'd gladly appreciate any help I can get!!!!!",

        "text": "I started a tenure-track faculty position a large land grant university in engineering 2.5 years ago. I was pretty shocked at the procedures that were in place for account management and student timekeeping. If I want to hire a student, I fill out a paper form and they get put into the system. I then have to go to an administrative assistant to view their timesheets and make adjustments to appointment end dates. I have no access to this information on my own. So if a student charges 20 hours and I only authorized 10, I don't even know about it (this has happened). The reverse has also happened, hired a student expecting 20 hours/week work and she was too busy and only doing a few hours/week. Didn't realize this for the first few months.\n\nFor my accounts, we have another administrative assistant that sends me a spreadsheet periodically showing charges to my accounts. I have no way to view the current balance and recent charges in these accounts. We recently went through some turn over and both of the people in these positions left. So basically if I want to know current status I have to keep up with all the charges myself. \n\nWhat I expected was an electronic system where I would approve timesheets, view research appointments, see charges on accounts, etc. I have not worked in a management position before, but I did work for a couple of engineering firms and a national lab, and everything seemed to be electronic (even 15 years ago). I have complained this system, because I don't feel like I know what is going on, but there is little I can do to change this. I want to see charges like I see them on my credit card or bank statement, and personally approve the timesheets.\n\nAre there other universities that use these seemingly very old fashioned approaches to account management and timekeeping? How common is it?",

Please excuse me if this sounds like an obvious task..  I truly don't understand the etiquette of communication in academia because I am a first generation immigrant, first generation college student, and I come from chaotic environment where communication is poorly practiced\n\nI started volunteering at this lab about 1.5 years ago.  I have since been providing the majority of the animal care, spending anywhere from 5 - 10 hours a week physically laboring in a dimly lit room where most of the equipment are falling apart, with a droning noise from the AC that is older than I am.  (funding is difficult, I think)  Recently, I've also earned the responsibility of conducting some experiments for the PI, but the PI and I don't have clear communication.  I'm not sure what I'm really getting out of this lab.  I'm not getting paid, I'm not sure if I will be credited in any published papers (and I don't think I care for the latter either).\n\nSide tangent: I've always enjoyed logic, problem solving, and I recently discovered that these are useful in programming.  I'm actually quite good at programming so far.\n\nThus, I'd really like to leave.  But I feel guilty for leaving because I know the PI doesn't have anyone to take care of the animals if I leave.  At the same time, I really cannot afford to volunteer my time at the lab because I have financial hardships (as do most recent college grads): I need to pay my bills, and I'd like to work towards getting a job in another career path.\n\nMy concern is.. what do I write in an email to communicate that a) I appreciate this opportunity, b) I can't volunteer anymore, c) that I'd like to help with the transition (no more than 2 weeks) d) but I really can't do more than that and e) in a way that doesn't \"burn bridges\" / end with him disliking me \n\nPlease advise",

Are you are able to provide further details about the project methods and hypotheses? \n\nI understand the research will already be looking at combined effects of carotid and brain damage on cognitive function, I was wondering to what extent this will be explored and if there would be any scope to investigate patterns of cognitive functioning and outcome in relation to different vascular pathology and carotid health markers. \n\nLastly, I would like to know how the current research project will fit into the PhD studentship trajectory/structure. \n\nI am very excited about this project and the potential opportunity to work with you on this studentship.\n\nThank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nXXXXXX",

My final exams are this week on Thursday and Friday. I would like to approach my profs and ask if I could have my final exam worth 100&amp;#37; of my final mark. Right now, outlined in both of the course outlines, the final exam is worth 40&amp;#37; of the final grade. The remaining 60&amp;#37; of the final grade is based on 2 midterms worth 20&amp;#37; each (40&amp;#37;) and in lecture pop quizzes (20&amp;#37;). In both courses, I have a 0 in the quizzes part. For calculus II my midterm average is 56&amp;#37; and for linear algebra it's 72&amp;#37;. As a professor or TA, what are your thoughts on having a student's final grade re-evaluated with the final exam worth 100&amp;#37;? Do you think it's unfair? Do you think it's unacceptable? I would love to know your thoughts  because I am nervous as fuck and my anxiety about just asking is eating me up.\n\nEDIT:  I should've mentioned that I meant that there be two grading scales for everyone. either 100&amp;#37; final exam as your final grade, or what the course outline has. Whichever is the better mark, is your final grade. I know other schools do this and I wanted to propose it to my professor. \n\nFor why I haven't been doing well: So the semester started on May 7 and my family decided to take a vacation back home to see my family. It was 3 weeks long, from the last week of April to mid May (May 15 is when we got back to Toronto). We went because my maternal grandma hasn't been doing well at all; she's suffering from dementia, anorexia, and a multitude of health problems. This might have been our last chance to see her :( and we haven't been in 8 years. We were in Bangladesh and I did not have a stable internet connection while I was there ( and tbh I was so busy with family). I thought I would be okay missing the first week of school, only 3 classes, it's fine I can catch up. When I got back, at my workplace, my manager had put in her two weeks notice while I was gone. We are a small clearance store with only 3 employees and because I have seniority and know everything that's going on, I was given a lot more responsibilities and working much more hours while the area manager finds someone to replace her or at least get someone to take most of my hours. Since we are such a small store, we need another keyholder, so someone who doesn't need training and can work alone. Even though I keep telling my area manager hurry up and find someone, no I cannot work these hours, I have school, I am behind in school, she continues to persuade me to stay and take hours. Also, if I don't, my co-worker gets more hours and she already has the max amount and I would feel so bad. All this extra work stuff and being behind in the first place has caused me to miss many classes and not be able to catch up on time for quizzes, hence I have a 0 in that area. My area manager has finally found someone and I have taken this entire week off to work on my school stuff. I am confident I can catch up and do well since math is easy for me and I am already 60&amp;#37; through all the course material so far and I still have 4 days to power through.",

I have had 5 summers of research experience with 2-3 years of research during the academic school year before graduating 5 years ago. Since then, I have considered different career routes such as campaigning for political candidates (which I did not enjoy like how I did my research life back in college) and considering a career in law, which I found was not what I expected. I am looking for either a research assistant or research tech job and to grow my skills from there, but I have forgotten how to do lots laboratory protocols due to not doing any research for approximately 5 years, making me now a poor research candidate. I remember the basics, such as scientific writing and basic project design, but have forgotten laboratory protocols.\n\nHowever, I am confident that I can relearn everything that I've forgotten and more. I'm looking for a research position ASAP, so I'm not sure how I can make this work reasonably and quickly as possible. I'm considering working for free to learn what I do not know, but expected to as a research applicant. However, is it possible to get on the job training and be paid in this field or is that completely bananas? Hoping for the best.",

Would it be wrong of me to email the second professor asking if we could meet as well? The first professor has not guaranteed me a spot or anything, just a meeting to talk about it. If it makes a difference, I emailed multiple professors and only the one that agreed to meet with me responded.\n\nAlso they are in the same department, is it likely that this could come up between the two professors and in the end hurt me and kill my chances at either? They are both really cool opportunities and I'm not sure which one I am more interested in yet.\n\nThank you so much for all of your help!",

The reason for being so low is because of my disabilities. I have been dealing with chronic pain for almost 10 years. And during my undergrad I was listening to my doctors thinking the medications were working. Well they were only making me worse mentally. I got off them and now I fell a lot better for the most part. \n\nThe problems/concerns I am running into:\n\n1.) I am 80% disabled probably going to be 100%. I cannot guarantee an employer that I can show up every day on time because sometimes I wake up in pain. How can I attempt a grad degree then? This happened the last semester of undergrad and I had to work with professors technically after graduation to make up work. I am thinking that most PhD's want people to work there ass off (which I would love to do, especially if it's my passion.) but I have to consider my limitations. At what point do I disclose my concerns? D\n\n2.) Is it even possible with my grades? I am only interested in Applied Math: Dynamical Systems. I am not 100% sure but I do believe my math GPA is 3.0 range. I had a computer science focus that destroyed my GPA. I have yet to take the GRE. and I do have a few professors that are very willing to right glowing recommendations. I believe because I was honest with them and worked my ass off in spite of the struggles and poor grade I got.  I failed a lot of stuff, but I never gave up and some classes I literally failed every assignment and exam and still passed with a 'D', this was abstract algebra if your curious.\nI am willing to retake if absolutely necessary, but the VA paid for it and since I technically passed I would have to pay out of pocket.  \n\n3.) I truly believe I can move past my limitations and become a more capable of being productive to society. And I have time. Is there an issue with just waiting a few years to work on issues and then applying? I assume most people going to grad school after years from undergrad have employment experiences. I won't have that. Is that an issue?\n\n\nAppreciate all opinions. I know that I have something to offer. Thanks ! And if this is not the best sub please let me know.\n",

Currently working in a bioinformatics lab and really enjoying my project. I have a publication in the works and hopefully it'll come out before I'm applying. I haven't written the GRE yet. My letters should be from research faculty who I have personally worked with, so hopefully those will be good, and I'm going to give everything I have to 4.0 for the last two years.\n\nSome days I feel like giving up, because it's a highly unlikely lottery and I feel like I've already lost. Other days I'm more optimistic. Is it still reasonably possible I could have a research career?\n\ntldr: Fucked up a semester because of medical issues, got 60's and 70's in major specific classes. can I still have a good research career and funding?

After much stress, I was approved to write a thesis which will concern speculative fiction (the field of English in which I'm intersted in studying) and I have a GPA at about 3.25. I want to know how much any of this matters for getting into PhD. programs such as Harvard's or Oxford's, MFA programs like Cornell and Glasgow (which has a program for fantasy), or joint MFA PhD. programs like Cornells (which is my goal next to Harvard as I intend on writing as well).\n\nWould performing well on a senior thesis (and coming from a reputable institution) supercede my relatively low GPA? \n\nI admit, this is a bit of a two-part question because of my far-looking (i.e. anxious) nature. How much does the name of my potential PhD. program matter for actually getting a job in English (a which I am repreatedly reassured is practically jobless)? Would taking a year abroad for travel make me look bad? \n\nThanks for your patience in reading this everyone.",

My PI argues that these emails are publicly available and therefore we should be in the clear. \n\nUltimately I feel incredibly uncomfortable doing this and even though he says any legal action taken against us will fall on him, I don't know if I can trust him and I want to use my coding powers for good and not evil!\n\nI would appreciate any advice in how I could get out of doing this, he is pressuring me a lot to do this and I am very uncomfortable. \n\nSorry for the crosspost from r/legaladvice but I figured people here might have a better understanding of what it is like to work under a PI in an academic environment and the pressures that go along with it.",

        "text": "Using my throwaway in case this is identifying.\n\nI started my second post-doc in the fall but am still close with the members of my last lab. The PI and I are friends, we meet at conferences a lot and catch up, and I learned a lot from him during my time (he respects his post-docs and treated me with nothing but care and respect). I also became good friends with many of the students, including one of his MSc students who is the subject of this post. During my time there (and during this post-doc to be honest), I struggled to find balance between being there for the students as a mentor and helping them navigate academia including helping them understand the PI's criticisms and suggestions, and also being an experienced scientist in the hierarchy of the lab and totally understanding my PI's point of view when it comes to the students' struggles or performance. \n\nThe MSc student in question has had a particularly rough time with the PI. Her project is especially difficult and a bit outside of the PI's wheelhouse, such that he demanded results from her that were pretty unreasonable (to me at least) given the techniques she was using and her experience level. She worked her ass off, pulled all-nighters, and did her best with the demands and the time/resources she had, but it never seemed like enough for him. I saw in the lab and was able to see the nitty-gritty of it, her tears and struggles as she tried to keep him happy. After every meeting she had with him, we had to take a walk or close the office door because she would break down sobbing. I have had many life discussions with her trying to talk her down and help her through this time. The kind of language she told me he was using to communicate his disappointment with her is pretty brutal (ie. \"this isn't good enough,\" \"you don't belong in science,\" \"this isn't worth my time to read\" \"you should know better,\" \"how could you think this was ok?\" \"you aren't very good at this\" etc etc). She has a history of mental illness, including depression and anxiety and confided in me that she had attempted suicide before starting grad school. Now after a long haul of nonstop issues with her project, she is finally writing her thesis. He expects that she will be giving him these perfectly written manuscripts for each chapter from the first drafts, but has not provided her with any sort of guidance on how to write a paper (she has no publications and no experience with this). He expects that his students will instinctively know where to look for resources and will by some kind of miracle or brute force learn how to write. His edits to her chapters have been vague and unhelpful (for example, highlighting entire paragraphs and commenting with a single question mark with no explanation), and she is on a tight deadline to get her thesis done. Every step has been a struggle for her and he has been of little to no help, and frankly, barely a mentor. I should note that of the 6 graduate students he has seen through writing and defending (her included), he has had major issues with 5 of them (to the point of the PI and student not being on speaking terms anymore). \n\nFrom a purely scientific perspective, I agree with the PI that she could have managed her time better, that writing might not be her strong suit, and she could use some guidance with refining her experimental design. However, I absolutely DO NOT condone the approach he has taken to supervising her. Shaming students into performing is such an old-school way of going about things, and while he may have come up in this system himself, he doesn't seem to comprehend the effect it can have on well-being and mental health. While I was still there, she had a particularly devastating meeting with him where he told her she was worthless and that he was so disappointed in her, etc, and she went home feeling suicidal. I had to call her to make sure she was ok. The next day I went to see him in a closed-door setting and explained to him that he should be careful with the way he talks to her (while not giving anything away that would violate her trust). He brushed me off saying she was too sensitive and \"that's just how it is in science.\" On the sidelines I have done everything I can to help support her, both in the lab with her experiments and writing, to outside of the lab as her friend.  \n\nUltimately, what is my responsibility as her friend and as a past member of his lab? Would I be out of place getting in touch with the PI and talking to him about his supervising style? \n\nThanks everyone",
