I read this book in the local library but i cant find it nor can i remember the author or the title.\n\nI only remember that title had something to do with green.\n\nBasically this young girl in the 1800s / early 1900s goes to live at her aunts place. The aunt has a strange son and a big piano in the living room. The girl often plays the piano throughout the story. She goes to the attic and finds out the house is cursed and gets haunted by a hand-ghost(?). She also at some part in the story works at the bakery.\n\nThe book was quite short btw.\n\nThank you!",

There's a similar trend with writing alien characters in sci-fi and having them end up as basically human, but with some cultural or physical quirks that mark them as alien.\n\nI recently read Sea of Rust and am now reading Ancillary Justice, both of which are great books featuring AI characters, but both of which come across quite human-like in their portrayal. The best example of a very non-humanlike alien race I can think of is in the novel Blindsight, which portrays a truly alien first contact.\n\nDo you have any suggestions?",

Roughly the same time period, and they both made hugely popular creative works with mass market appeal that also have some real depth. If you haven't read any Crichton, do yourself a favor and pick some up!\n\n**Here's the setup** of Andromeda Strain (no spoilers, but putting in tags just in case you like to go in totally blank slate):\n\n&gt;!A US government program is sending satellites with scoops into orbit, looking for alien organisms that can survive the void of space. When one of the scoops comes down in the Arizona desert two soldiers are sent out to pick it up. But as they get closer, they realize the signal has moved - someone has already picked up the object and moved it into the tiny town of Piedmont. As the two men pull into town, bodies line the streets. In less than five minutes they are dead too.  !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The government is forced to mobilize Project Wildfire, a top-secret emergency response protocol. Four of the nation’s most elite biophysicists are summoned to a clandestine underground laboratory where they must race to understand and contain the crisis. But the Andromeda Strain proves different from anything they’ve ever seen - and what they don’t know could not only hurt them, but lead to unprecedented worldwide catastrophe.!&lt;\n\n**And what makes it great (and what held it back)**:\n\nThe central idea is unbelievably propulsive and the beginning of the novel is unforgettable. Unfortunately it slows a bit as the book goes on and the ending isn’t very satisfying - but I still couldn’t put the book down and read the whole thing in one day.\n\nThe most unique thing about the book is the narrative style - its framed as a top secret document detailing real events, and that very much helps make it feel real, engrossing, and a little transgressive that we get to read it. \n\nOne watch out about that narrative style - the book includes a number of pages of maps, printouts from military computers, comms transcripts, and pages of top-secret documents which are really not meant to be read line by line, but add to the realistic feeling. But on audiobook they read all those words out verbatim and its pretty brutal - so this is a better book to read in print than audio.\n\nThe core concept is based on a proposed answer to the Fermi-Paradox.  Essentially if we are going to encounter extraterrestrial life, it is far more likely we encounter single-cell or viral organisms first before complex life just because it is much more likely to evolve and develop. That's just one of a wide number of interesting scientific ideas and theories that are raised throughout the book. As a testament to how real the science felt, there is a bibliography at the end - and I felt like I needed to check if the work he’s citing is real. Its not, but could have fooled me!\n\nDefinitely my favorite Crichton novel - check it out if you haven't read it!",

Yet the book makes it seem like I should empathize with him. \n\nHe's a liar, a truant, a vandal, a cheater, a rapist, a pedophile, a hooligan, and a murderer. Seemingly able to do all this stuff without consequences until his friends betray him. \n\nWhile in jail, He's still just as violent and hateful. He then goes through the \"treatment,\" where for two whole chapters, He's  cured of evil. \n\nThen, when he becomes the victim, he still lies and pathetically begs for help. The one man who helped him was one of his victims. He gets used to enact change in the politics that he cared very little for and then tries to kill himself, but he fails. Then he learns the guy he used got arrested  before he could enact any kind of revenge because he wanted to kill Alex. Then the treatment wore off, and he went back to being shitty and violent immediately. \n\nI mean, what was the point? Evil always wins? Being an asshole gets rewarded? Freedom of choice is the freedom to be a criminal? The state reflects the people?\n\nI mean, I read an interview where the author says it's about growing up, but is it? I don't really see any themes. Is it an imaginary story told by a kid who wants to look cool to an audience?",

        "text": "Reading books can be very mysterious and strange sometimes. I tend to have odd coincidences and I always make unlikely discoveries. As a longtime reader I frequently encounter synchronicity. Either I am reading something at just the right moment, or a line may seem prophetic. But the most interesting experiences have been the way I've stumbled across certain books. I'll share one example. \n\nOne day I was visiting a friend, we were sitting outside of a coffee shop having coffee and talking. The subject turned to books and he said I should read the book Being and Nothingness, he said it was one of the greatest books ever. The way he explained it to me made me interested. So I asked him if I could borrow it from him, but he said he had just lent it to someone else and couldn't help me with that. \n\nThat book stayed on my mind afterwards, I kept wanting to find a copy of it for myself. A few days later I went to a used bookstore. I hoped I would find that book there even though it seemed impossible. Yet as soon as I walked into the bookstore, there it was sitting on a shelf, a vintage 1963 edition of Being and Nothingness. I couldn't believe I had found it out of the blue like that, it was a strange coincidence. Now the irony is, after I bought that book I put it on my shelf and years later still have not read a single page of it!\n\nThis happened to me a few times though. Even if the author isn't common, usually I always find the books that I want. It's very strange to think about. The other times this happened was when I was looking for a copy of Look Homeward Angel. I kept thinking about it and thinking about it, and then one day I walked into the used bookstore and there it was. \n\nAnyway, I've had so many great experiences finding the books that I want, it's a magical feeling. So whenever I can I donate many great books and leave them behind for other people to find. \n\nWhat is the strangest way you've found a book?",

        "text": "Just finished it on my second try - I tried to read it years ago as a younger man and couldn't get ten pages in, but this time just hit different and I really enjoyed it, so hoping to get people talking about it.\n\nIn my view the most interesting discussion to be had is how the novel relates to Wilde's aestheticism - for those who don't know, Wilde subscribed to a school of thought which posited that the purpose of the arts, including literature, should be to be beautiful rather than to serve a moral or ethical function. \nThe story, when it comes down to it, is a tragedy about how a man was ruined by his vanity and wasted his life, shown when in his final days Dorian laments that he was not a good man. The book is beautiful, sure, but there's an essential moral underpinning here that makes it more than just that, it has its basis just as much in ethics as does any other work. It reads like Wilde is doing the exact thing that aestheticism condemns, which is using his work to relay moral lessons to his readers.\n\nWhat about the part that Lord Henry played? His character here is open to interpretation, did he deliberately drive Dorian to depravity, or did he only intend to mess with him a little? Is he some great moral philosopher, or a charlatan who just parrots whatever line he thinks will earn him some controversy? In both cases I'm inclined to think the latter.\n\nWhat do you think Dorian blackmailed Campbell with? The obvious answer is that he and Dorian were lovers, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any alternative suggestion gleaned from the text.\n\nWomen and the poor are often belittled and looked down upon in this work, but I'm unsure if this is reflective of Wilde's own views or if he's simply representing the reality of his time. I don't know that much about Wilde beyond the basics, but I suspect it's the latter.\n\nAnyway I've written this late at night and it's probably barely coherent, but let me have your thoughts!",

I haven't read Big Little Lies, but I definitely enjoyed the series (so probably won't read it now, I generally can't read after watching. The other was is fine though).

        "text": "I've been reading The ABC murders and I am 70 pages in but absolutely nothing interesting has happened so far. I'm really bored. The prose is dull and straightforward. There's been absolutely no care put into writing at all. I understand that the point is \"writing out the facts\" but it doesn't make for entertaining reading. I don't read many mystery novels but I know these books don't prioritize beautiful prose but I read *The Big Sleep* a few years ago and i remember it being very nicely written. Very evocative and interesting. This is not like that. There's no sense of atmosphere here. \n\nThe two main characters (Poirot and Hastings) are both poor imitations of Holmes and Watson. While Holmes has that sort of romanticism about him, you can really see him as this quirky genius, Poirot is just annoying. He doesn't come off as intelligent. His little Italian quirks feel silly in not a good way. Hastings is incredibly dull and provides nothing to the story.\n\nThe dialogue in mystery novels is supposed to be sharp, clever. I want funny one liners, exciting conversations, tension but there's none of that. It's very, very flat. There is no sense of urgency or sharpness. \n\nI also find the book a bit distasteful. In the beginning Poirot asks Hastings what his favorite crime is and he says \"Murder!\" like it's some sort of a spicy dish. The characters even wish out loud someone would be murdered so they can get their kick. This is not my first Agatha Christie novel. The first thing I read by her was not writing by her. It was actually a novelization of one of her plays. I enjoyed that. It was very clever, especially the ending. Then I tried \"The mysterious affair at styles\" thinking it would be similar but that book put me to sleep. I learned the prevalent opinion is that that is one of her weaker works so I thought I'd read *The ABC murders* but it's just as bad. Am I alone in this? Everyone I know loves Agatha Christie.",

        "text": "I'm searching for the title of a audio book I listened to a while ago. But I must have deleted it and I can't remember the title or character names. But im hoping someone will know. Here's what I know -\n\n- It's a sci-fi comedy book. Think along the same lines as will save the Galaxy for food.\n\n- the main character is an irreverent space captain type, kinda reminded me of Malcolm Reynolds from Firefly. Not exactly a bad guy or good guy. Smuggler type\n\n- story. As I remember. He had just pulled off some sort of mission and it didn't go well. He wasn't going to be able to pay his crew so he (I think) tricked them into visiting a planet thinking they were getting a little mini vacation \n\n- another job comes along where there is some sort of Rebellion going on and the creatures there needed weapons\n\n- I THINK THIS IS THE MOST UNIQUE PART OF THE STORY TO HELP NARROW IT DOWN. On board his ship he has 2 creatures kept in secret. I can't remember if they are physical creatures or Super advanced alien A.I. but they have to be kept apart. If they were to come together Theresa high chance they would merge and take over the Galaxy. The 2 creatures praise the captain and call him all kinds of nice names hoping that he will merge them. \n\n- the A.I. creatures have some sort of, idk essentially a super advanced 3D printer. The captain can essentially tell them the parameters of what he wants guns, bombs, ect. And they can craft anything. He uses that to arm the creatures on the planet to fit their size and odd hand shape.\n\n- there is a 2nd storyline going. This part I'm a little fuzzy on. The captain owes money to lots of different criminal groups. He borrows from one to pay another. One group sends along some sort of, idk. Robot cyborg creatre to make sure things go to plan and the criminal boss gets paid. I think the captain ends up tricking and dropping it into some large vat of 3d printer chemical stuff that kills it. \n\n I've spent months searching through thousands of titles, authors, narrators, audible, Google but iv had no luck. Iv heard some internet sleuth can solve a 20yr old murder mystery on the other side of the world maybe you can help me.",

However, I dislike that the final book in this particular part of the series was the last we hear of Jason and his friends until Trials of Apollo. I do believe this book is better than the first Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians book by tenfold. \n\nRiordan split over half of the entire series into a single mission.

The characters and motivations felt dull and ever moment was just so flat to me. The writing on its own was good, but the story and messages weren’t anything special. That’s what I thought before starting my essay on the book. I didn’t really want to reread the novel immediately for the essay, so I just skimmed through it looking for quotes. And somehow, the quotes, when separated from the larger text, made me realize so much about the novel that I hadn’t noticed before. I’m still unsure as to why I suddenly had an epiphany about the book’s meaning and the true depth of the characters, but I’m happy I did. In researching the book and thinking hard about it for my essay, I found myself reading the story behind the story, the writing in between each sentence. Ray Bradbury’s writing in F451 was subtle and his character work simple at first glance. But on a second, closer peek, it was wonderful. \n\nI’ve never changed my mind on a book like this before. Which makes me wonder, have I been reading wrong? Do I not pay enough attention to the stories and the writing when I read? Have I missed out on so much simply because I wasn’t reading correctly?\n\nWhat do you all think? Has anyone had anything similar happen? Should I start reading books deeper the first time round?",

        "text": "Hi! \n\nI hope it’s okay to post this here. I’m putting this on r/books, because I looked everywhere for a list like this when I started Allen Eskens’ book series, and there wasn’t much out there. He’s written a LOT and, though it isn’t a linear series in the usual sense, it does deal with the same characters, off and on. Some don’t pop back up for several years, but their current lives are almost always mentioned in each new volume. \n\nThere *is* a set timeline to this series, but he wrote some of them out of order— and there is a lot of ambiguity in which books come first. I spent a lot of time searching Google, Reddit, and Goodreads for one. Having found very few answers —and given the upcoming TV adaptation of The Life We Bury— I decided to just make one myself! I took notes as I went through each book, just so I’d have an idea of where each novel fit. Hopefully, it will help you avoid the uncertainty I felt when trying to determine which book was next in line!\n\n———————————\n\nSo, without further ado, here is a full list of Allen Eskens’s books in chronological order:\n\n**1.** Nothing More Dangerous— takes place in spring/summer of 1976. It’s a prequel about Boady Sanden’s youth in rural Missouri, and the racial tensions boiling just below the surface. **This should be on everybody’s reading list, regardless whether or not you’re familiar with this author’s work. It is absolutely sublime!**\n\n\n**2.** The Life We Bury— “officially” introduces Joe Talbert, Lila Nash, Max Rupert, Boady Sanden, and Nikki Vang. This is the first book Allen Eskens wrote, and it takes place in the cold, Missouri winter. \n\n\n**3.** The Guise of Another— introduces Max Rupert’s brother, Alexander, a fellow cop who has found himself in hot water. Takes place the autumn after The Life We Bury. (This is probably the only book in the series I feel is in any way optional. Like Nothing More Dangerous, it *can* function as a stand-alone, but I recommend it if you’re interested in learning more about Max Rupert’s past.)\n\n\n**4.** The Heavens May Fall— takes place in July, 3 full years after The Life We Bury (and 9 months after the events of The Guise of Another.) Boady Sanden, Max Rupert, Nikki Vang, and Lila Nash are all in this book. \n\n\n**5.** The Deep Dark Descending— takes place on New Years Eve, *immediately* after the events of The Heavens May Fall, and covers only 3 days. It’s solely about Max Rupert (and an absolutely stellar character study, in my opinion. Very different from Eskens’ other books!)\n\n\n**6.** The Shadows We Hide— takes place in July, six years after The Life We Bury. This is the first book (since The Life We Bury) that Joe Talbert is featured as the main character. A lot of time has passed between these two books —and there are definite spoilers for books 3 and 4— so I suggest reading them first! Otherwise, you may end up feeling a little lost.\n\n\n**7.** The Stolen Hours— takes place the autumn after the events of The Shadows We Hide. Lila Nash is the main character. A first for Allen Eskens, and *very* successful in my opinion. (He writes women really well!)\n\n\n**8.** Forsaken Country— I haven’t gotten to this book yet, but I’ll be sure to update when I do! It’s a follow up on Max Rupert’s story after the events of The Deep Dark Descending. \n\n———————————\n\n\nIf you’re reading this and thinking “Hmm, maybe I should take a crack at this series,” my advice is DO IT. Each of the books are so different from the last, and every last one of them is satisfying for different reasons! Most have elements of mystery and suspense in them, although I wouldn’t exactly call them “mystery books.” They’re more like character studies, with components of mystery, police procedural, and law as a backdrop— very much like John Grisham’s early work, with a flair of Barry Eisler thrown in for good measure. \n\nI could keep writing about the timeline of these books, but I’ll stop here. I don’t want to spoil things for anyone who might be new to them!",

In this book though, those minor things were just red her rings for the sake of it.. None of the minor plots like the s*xual ab*se by the brother in law tied up to the story - not even in the sense that Alicia's father was abusive in a similar way kind of way... No connection at all! \n\nWhat did you all think? I can't think of other precise things i didn't like there.. But it brought down the entire vibe of the book down.. Like the movie The Exam..",

        "text": "For silly reasons, I find myself avoiding a lot of **household-name classic books** because part of me expects them to be dusty and uninspired, a paint-by-the-numbers sort of thing.\n\nBut \n\n* Hemingway's *A Moveable Feast* was absolutely delightful.\n* rereading Great Gatsby reminded me how brilliant the book was.\n* forcing myself to open up Moby Dick acquainted me with one of the most exciting, playful, and profound stories I've yet to read. Not a single book, even my other favorites, come close to that level of profundity, tenderness, humility, and fun.\n* I stupidly assumed Camus' *The Stranger* would be as insufferable the people who always talk about Camus' *The Stranger.* I found it really, really moving.\n* my mother told me about *The Road* and *Blood Meridian* for years. I assumed *Blood Meridian* wouldn't be one of the most fascinating books I'd ever encountered. But I read it last year, and I still haven't shaken it. It's exactly what some historians have said: a new type of living history in literature. It was bizarre. It was filled with tiny routine moments that, a few words later, shifted down to cosmic structures and then up to ruminations about the American spirit. Insane.\n* I bet Stephen King is really good, and I bet there are plenty of trending contemporary authors who have a lot of valuable things to say, who have achieved really impressive things in their books.\n\n**And there's another tier of classics**, the ones bookish people tell me about that aren't quite household names, that don't bring about this same (admittedly misled) \"taming\" feeling. For instance, Borges' *Ficciones* was exactly as incredible as I was told it wa. Ralph Waldo Emerson's *Nature* and *Essays* (1st/2nd Series) were just as brilliant as I was led to believe. Rilke's *Letters*. John Muir's travel writing. Joan Didion rocks. etc.\n\nStill, back to the household names: There is nothing tame or uninteresting or uninspired about these books. I'm wrong time and time again. **But I still feel a deep resistance to picking up Dickens. Is this just an insufferable personality trait or is there something about books that achieve household-name status that makes readers skeptical?**",
