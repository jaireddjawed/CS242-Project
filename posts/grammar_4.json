When the direct speech is in the past-tense, it's often backshifted into the past-perfect; however, I came across this sentence and felt like the adverbial adjunct clause didn't need to be backshifted, but I can't figure out why:   \n\n\n&gt;\"I smelled gas when I entered the room\" ---&gt; \"He said that he had smelled gas when he entered the room.\"\n\nOddly enough, I believe that fronting the adverbial clause would still yield the same structure:\n\n&gt;\"He said that when he entered the room, he had smelled gas.\"\n\nHowever in the above sentence, I feel like backshifting \"entered ---&gt; had entered\" is a bit *more* acceptable.\n\nRegardless, in the above sentences, I don't feel like it's necessary to backshift the adverbial clause, but I can't seem to find any sources that advocate nor refute my belief. If one verb is backshifted, do all verbs in a given utterance need be backshifted? \n\nI want to say that the adjunctive here doesn't need to be backshifted, but there's nothing in any of my grammar books which give clear-cut rules for this. \n\nOne book (Cambridge Grammar of English) has an utterance with two verbs that were backshifted, but another book (Complete English Grammar Rules) has a contradictory entry of one verb phrase being backshifted, and the other verb phrase NOT being backshifted - that same book then goes on to declare that such shifting is optional, but doesn't go into any more detail than that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to look at my question!",
