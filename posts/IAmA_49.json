        "text": "Greetings Reddit! We are Jennings Brown and Jessica Glazer, the host and lead producer of Gizmodo's investigative podcast The Gateway. We spent the last year investigating Teal Swan, a new type of spiritual guru, who draws in followers with her hypnotic self-help YouTube videos. Swan specifically uses SEO to target people who are struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nYou can listen to the podcast here: [https://megaphone.link/PPY1780451815](https://megaphone.link/PPY1780451815)\n\nSome followers move to Teal’s healing center in Costa Rica. It’s basically a spiritual startup where they produce content and manage social media accounts. We spent a week at this center, getting to know Teal’s operation and learning about Teal’s influence over her followers. We also went out to Utah to investigate the death of one of Teal’s first followers.\n\nIt’s been a long, strange, dark trip and we want to tell you about it. What would you like to know?\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/Gizmodo/status/1011989163405660161](https://twitter.com/Gizmodo/status/1011989163405660161)",

Last year, however, I got the immense surprise of being among the top 15 students in the Brazilian Biology Olympiad, which made me classify as a finalist, despite not getting selected for any international ones. This year, once more, I got to be with the other 14 in the finals, and yet again wasn't selected. Still, I supposed this was worthwhile enough for this subreddit and I'll be answering questions for the rest of the afternoon (at least 4 more hours). AMA!\n\nEDIT: I'm still going, although I might take a while to answer, and plan to do so for some more hours. When I'm done, I'll edit it once again. (I'll likely still accept questions PMed to me or something, even when I say I'm over, feel free to ask)\n\n**EDIT2:** Ok, Now I'm done and will leave. Again, if anyone wants to ask anything, you still can, I just don't promise to answer them, nor do it soon. I don't exactly understand why the \"Live\" flag was removed after the first edit, I think that was a misunderstanding, if so, sorry for being vague.

There's yer damned proof!\n\nAnyway. Since then, Podium Publishing picked up my entire series, 'Another Stupid Trilogy'. The amazing voice actor James Patrick Cronin brought them all to life, and ['Another Stupid Spell' hits Audible](https://audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Another-Stupid-Spell-Audiobook/B07DD17WBK) TODAY!\n\nI'm here to answer all of your questions!

If you buy the audiobook and like it, please rate it on the Audible site. I appreciate any and all love with those Amazon ratings of course. But the life or death of an audiobook is the Audible rating.\n\nIf you like it, consider getting the audiobook for 'Another Stupid Demon' on July 24, and 'Another Stupid Apocalypse' on August 28.\n\nNow, let's do this. I'm here for 12 hours. You heard that right. I want every timezone to get a crack at me. Let's go, bring it on!\n\n---\n\nEdit 1: We're now the [number one Epic Fantasy E-book on Amazon](http://billricardi.com/number1.jpg). Words cannot express my humble gratitude.\n\n---\n\nEdit 2: Entering the last half hour or so of this AMA. Not too many questions this time around, but still, I'm amazed by the interest in 'Another Stupid Spell'. Here are today's Amazon stats for the free E-book:\n\nEpic Fantasy: #1 / ALL Fantasy: #7 / ALL SF &amp; Fantasy: #8 / Amazon Top 100: #74\n\nDownloads today: 1,785\n\nThank you all so much for your support!\n\n---",

        "text": "Hi Reddit!\n\nIn 2015 I lobbied Congress to increase USAID funding for clean drinking water projects around the world. In 2016, I lobbied Congress to increase funding for the United States Institute of Peace, an organization that tries to prevent violent conflict. Knowing how important professional lobbying is to getting laws passed in Congress, I decided to start [Lobbyists 4 Good](https://www.lobbyists4good.org) the first crowdfunding platform that enables everyday Americans to [hire lobbyists](https://www.lobbyists4good.org) working on our behalf. AMA!\n\nProof its me: [https://www.lobbyists4good.org/about](https://www.lobbyists4good.org/about) (Scroll down to my bio)\n\nProof I lobbied: [http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2016/RR/300824002.xml](http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2016/RR/300824002.xml)\n\nPhoto: [https://twitter.com/BillyDeLancey/status/1011605053680050177](https://twitter.com/BillyDeLancey/status/1011605053680050177)\n\nLooking forward to your questions!\n\nBilly\n\nUPDATE#1: I am back and trying to get through as many questions as possible.  Just to clarify a couple things, my nonprofit is a crowdfunding platform that enables everyday people to hire lobbyists. The reason we are doing this is that lobbying is the MOST effective way to influence government and get a new policy passed. Right now, over 95&amp;#37; of lobbyists work for corporations or special interest groups and very few work for the public interest groups. If we had lobbyists on our side, we could level the playing field between us and corporations. It seems that some people think I am downplaying the impact money has in politics, I am not. I am simply pointing out the research which shows what lobbying is and why lobbying, not campaign donations, are the real reason for the imbalance of power in politics.\n\nUPDATE#2: Ok, that is it from me. I enjoyed this experience even though it was a rough crowd. I did the AMA to try and show people that lobbying is an effective tool. Businesses use it to get government to work for them and regular people do not have access to it, and that is what we are trying to change. The actual practice of lobbying is not as nefarious as everybody thinks and, as you can see by this thread, it is extremely misunderstood. Thanks to all those who were positive about the idea and asked great questions, I really appreciated hearing your thoughts and feedback. Check out our nonprofit's crowdfunding platform at [www.lobbyists4good.org](http://www.lobbyists4good.org). Thanks again, Billy",

In early 2017, I decided to visit every blue mailbox in Seattle and document the experience. Why? Because it seemed like an absurd, meaningless thing to do. I spent a couple weeks thinking about the logistics of tackling such a thing, and at the beginning of March I set out to capture the first of over 300 boxes. I posted one photo a day, wrapping up with a final photo in February of this year. My site (https://mailboxesofseattle.tumblr.com/) contains all the photos, plus links to the various media write-ups that soon followed.\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/atlasobscura/status/1010252406624571393",

I specialize in laser vision correction as well as eye allergies, astigmatism, cataracts, corneal diseases, double vision, nearsightedness, farsightedness, glaucoma, macular degeneration, optic nerve disease, dry eye syndrome, vitreous disorders and emergency and general eye care.\n\nAtlanta Vision Institute was the first eye care center in Georgia to offer [SMILE LASIK](https://www.atlanta2020.com/laser-eye-procedures/smile/) ([here](http://www.prweb.com/releases/smile-lasik/smile-laser-eye-surgery/prweb14243932.htm) to view press release). This procedure uses the latest laser vision technology approved by the FDA: the Carl Zeiss VisuMax Femtosecond Laser System. So I am quite familiar with the procedure.\n\n\"Other procedures offered by Dr. Ashraf include LASIK, bifocal correction, cataract surgery, corneal transplants, cosmetic surgery, diagnostic testing, general ophthalmology and more. Dr. Ashraf's ability to perform over 40,000 LASIK surgeries contributes to his status of being one of the most experienced LASIK surgeons worldwide. Dr. Ashraf has offices in Atlanta, GA and Dubai. The Atlanta Vision Institute has been a four-year recipient of the prestigious Consumers' Choice Award in Business Excellence.\"\n\n**My Proof:**\n\nInstagram:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/BkYpGfEHfFu/?taken-by=atlantalasik](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkYpGfEHfFu/?taken-by=atlantalasik)\n\nTwitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Atlanta2020/status/1010672197243949056](https://twitter.com/Atlanta2020/status/1010672197243949056)\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n**Even though I am a medical professional, you are taking my advice at your own risk.

They play an important role in their ecosystems and display a range of sensitivity to man-made impacts.\n\nFor example, some species exploit man-made areas by roosting in buildings, and may even increase their abundances, while others are unable to adapt to such disturbances. This has implications for many aspects of bat ecology, interspecies interactions, and interactions with humans.\n\nI have with bats for over a decade, and my work has taken me to Brazil, Oregon, Israel, Kentucky, and now Swaziland!\n\n[Proof!](https://facebook.com/UFIFASWildlife/photos/a.550068721773002.1073741827.540395682740306/1687829297996933/?type=3&amp;source=48)\n\nAMA!\n\n**Thanks everyone, I really enjoyed answering all the questions!
