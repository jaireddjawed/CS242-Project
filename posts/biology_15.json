It will be a lot of work, I have a year to do it, but I have one problem - I don't know what thesis to ask.

I would like to obtain at least a masters in molecular or micro biology. I am 32 years old and am concerned that time may not be on my side when it comes to taking risks. I am hoping for a position that would pay at least 80k a year. Is this likely or expected for someone with an advanced degree in the biology field? Are the jobs reasonably obtainable? Or should I just stick out the computer science degree? I really can't picture myself working in a cubicle creating lines of code all day. Any insight would be helpful.
