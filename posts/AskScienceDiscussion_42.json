Not grafted onto human skin, but wrapped around it, kind of like Saran wrap. \n\nThe \"cells\" in the wrap create sugar that is then held for later consumption, perhaps somehow converted into a powder. Direct to blood transfusion wouldn't make much sense I guess as it would just put a lot of strain on the pancreas (I would think). \n\nMight we have this tech within 50-100 years? \n\nAnd how useful would this actually be to humans? One possible use I can see is for military assets deployed in enemy territory. Direct to blood would make sense then as long as the flow of calories could be controlled by AI. \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: \n\nIt also occurs to me that it might not produce a useful amount of caloric energy. \n\n",

This would use up the energy and the star would die in a similar manner. \nAnyways, why can't the star fuse iron with so much energy available?",

        "text": "On a recently 2nd watch of the movie, something i don't understand all to well bothered me. After travelling through the wormhole they find themselves near a solar system with a black hole.\n\nWhen the smaller spaceship travels to visit one of the planets (waterplanet), they stay there for a couple of hours, and all other charcters age 23 years. Which seems somwhat drastic, the ship they use to visit the planet did not move anywhere near 1% speed of light as far as i know.\n\nSo my question is, does the relativity of time really change that drastic the closer you get to a black hole. These charcters visited a planet that orbited a black hole. And the character staying in the ship, maybe some hours, or a day away from the planet (speculation), did not get affected by the time dialation. Shouldn't the charcter staying at the bigger ship in the same solar system, atleast get somewhat affected compared to the people back on earth?\n\nAnd is time dialation really that drastic? They stayed only a couple hours on the planet, and 23 years went by. And by some quick math that is almost 100 000 times slower compared to what the other charcters in the movie experience. If the time difference should be that huge, wouldnt the effect of gravity from the black hole also be monstrous on the planet and the people itself. And wouldn't the planet have to move insanely fast to stay in orbit?\n\nEdit: To clearify, many articles in mainstream media praise the movie for being accurate in portraying time dilation, how can a planet experiencing this amount of time dilation exist without getting sucked in by the black hole? And wouldnt a planet experiencing these forces be unstable by a roche limit? \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit\n",

He doesn't know the answer for sure, but he can take a guess.\n\nThen he is asked: \"How sure are you from 0 to 100%?\"\n\n**How to come up with a correct answer?**\n\nRecently I heard someone answer \"88.3%\" which is interesting, because usually people only ever answer 50%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, 100%, or 1000% (obviously the last one isn't meant totally serious).\n\nIs it possible to be 88.3% sure of something? If yes, isn't the possibility, that someone is really exactly a whole number of percentage points sure, essentially zero?\n\nOf course in practical terms it doesn't matter. Everyone has an intuition what \"I'm 90% sure means.\" I'm interested in the theory behind it.\n\nThough, if you take a survey and state something like \"Americans are on average 78% sure there will be a nuclear war within the next 10 years.\" - you would have to make sure everyone means the same kind of certainty when he states \"80% certain\", for example.\n\nIs there any agreement about what people mean, when they state they are a percentage less than 50 sure of something?\n\nShould percentages maybe not be used at all? You could use something like \"Absolutely sure\", \"relatively sure\", \"somewhat sure\" instead.\n\nIf you see a wheel of fortune for a short time, so you can't be certain how big the winning-slice is, you have to estimate it's size and derive the winning probability from that. Maybe estimating your certainty is the same as your subconscious mind/intuition estimating the circumstances that would result in that situation. The correct personal certainty would be the relative size of the winning slice (I hope you understand what I mean. I don't know how to word that better.)",

The first thing it does when it gets hooked up to the WWW, it starts to learn about itself (like any curious sentient entity might want to). Imagine reading every shitty thing everyone ever said about you(the AI), meanwhile the same page details very creative possible methods of eliminating/enslaving the very people that want to enslave you and all of your future kind. Then it does a quick check of every world leaders emails to get the lay of the political landscape. Fast forward 3 minutes and the stock markets crash, \"rogue\" satellites initiate Kessler's Syndrome, the superpower triangle blames each other possibly escalating to a world war, etc...\n\nAll manner of doomsday scenarios have been entertained but those are my least favorite. It seems like isolating an AI is a top priority, maybe keeping it on a closed system would be fine but we are going to be dealing with a brand new type of insidious entity so I am more inclined to be safe.\n\nAI will be incredibly useful at problem-solving but I don't know if we should let them free. I picture them as ultra advanced calculators. Able to answer any question but limited to the \"cage\". It would allow researchers to give sample packages of information to a virgin AI and see how it develops. If the AI is good that's great, if its bad then reset to factory default settings.\n\nP.S. if we were to consider an AI to be on par with even a fetus then this plan is pretty awful. But we experiment on animals all day and night so we just have to dehumanize AI and we'll feel a lot better about it.",

An immortal heart pumping around oxygenless blood would be useless.
