        "text": "Firstly that was a great episode. I liked Ep1 but apart from the opening of Ep 2; I found it to be paint by numbers zombie/ post-apocalyptic story. \"NPC syndrome\" was in full effect with that ending. But Ep3 was fantastic a 9/10 in book, with [\\~8% of IMDB feeling the same](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14500888/ratings/?ref_=tt_ov_rt)\n\n3 weeks ago I talked about how Velma was getting review bombed, but because it was a \"Mid\" show no one was going to balance off the hate it was getting. I've gotten nearly 500 responses, direct messages and comments ranging from simply telling me I'm wrong to accusing me of being Mindy while calling me whatever you can imagine. \n\nNow here is the Last of Us with arguably one of the best self contained episodes made by HBO, maybe in the genre. With \\~4,500 1/10 reviews.\n\nOn  [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-last-of-us/season-1/episode-3-long-long-time/user-reviews) a similar thing is happening giving it a 6.5/10 with 109 total reviews. Here are some reviews: \n\n**User: DarkArt** *\"Episode 3 is 80% gay propaganda, it's not funny anymore! That's not what I'm interested in, I want to watch a show about the post-apocalypse where people survive as best they can, not about the love of bearded men!\" 2/10*\n\n**User: bobcarlos** ***\"****It's not about the game. This is about ideology. Watching that was one of the most embarrassing things in my life.\" 0/10*\n\n **User: kathanorn \"***So far worst episode that brings nothing to the story but only purpose for that is to please certain agenda. Okay the scenery is beautiful and music is top notch, yet Neil butchered his very own story.\" 0/10* \n\nThe last of Us has had the support of fans and IMDB now after the frenzy has died down removes these sorts of reviews after assessing the validity and reasoning behind them. Its debatable if this is a good practice. As a similar thing can happen in reverse with positive review bombs. Personal feel that review bombing doesn't hurt big TV shows. People are going to watch it regardless, we have seen this with Rings of Power, She-Hulk, Velma,  13th Doctor Who run etc... \n\nThe problem comes with smaller shows that in the past survived based on how much love they got from the community. In the Netflix weekly canceled era I feel that these are the true victims of these acts. Because they don't have 15,000 people giving it 10/10, they just looking for viewers",

Some of these shows don't have official release dates yet and I haven't seen all of them, these are just my predictions.
