There may also be genes that modify the way neurotransmitters work, or help strengthen synaptic connections more quickly. Such genes could enhance mental faculties in adults, but would probably be more limited to having a better memory and thinking faster, rather than having great capacities at solving problems or having a musical aptitude. How would we get PAST these issues ? ",

I found this [page](https://whatistranshumanism.org/) about what Transhumanism is defined as, and thought that it offered a good summary of roughly how I view transhumanism. Specifically this first definition:\n\n1. The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.\n\nBut judging by discussions and posts made here, I see there is also a drift/movement towards focusing exclusively on the actual technologies that could be called 'transhuman' (mind uploading, life extension, brain implants/augments) and less emphasis on the improvement of the overall human condition. Put simply, I see transhumanism as a socio-economic movement that seeks to improve the human condition so greatly that we, as a people, transcend our limitations (social, physical, intellectual, economic, etc) and become something no longer recognizable as humanity, and as such believe in the need to align all aspects of society with transhumanism values. However what I consider to be transhuman values are not necessarily what others consider to also be transhuman values. Which brings me back to the purpose of this post, what does transhumanism mean to you? And going further, what is the scope of transhumanism and why?\n\nTL;DR transhumanism, what that? ",

        "text": "Transhumanism is an incredible movement. It takes one of the central ideas from humanism, that which says humans should have more agency, and takes it to the last consequences.\n \nHumanism still exists and has evolved and branched a lot since it's birth, but it still focuses mostly on philosophy. Transhumanism tries to add practicity. We could say that for the first time a movement exists where people actively and openly defend the use of science for the improvement of humanity.\n\nHowever, the movement spends too much time worrying about achieving a post-human state, which is it's weakest link. This is certainly a controversial view, since \"trans\" basically mean to go beyond, however, I still believe that the core goal of transhumanism should be the increase in human agency through science and not necessarily the ascencion to a state that is \"more than human\". Why? That is simple, because the idea of post-human is too subjective.\n\nMembers of the movement seem to forget that the classification of a species is ultimately an arbitrary one. A few years ago, it used to be based on certain traits. Currenly it is based on genetic analysis. These methods have their uses on certain fields, but they aren't useful for answering the question of \"what is to be human?\"\n\nThis question itself has had many answers depending on the dominating culture. Humans are the only beings who have soul, who have intelligence, or whatever. And this hasn't changed today. To some, if you can espace aging you will already have surpassed the condition of human. To others, the post-human condition would be a state where we experience the universe in a way that is unconcievable to humans right now, and some groups will say you aren't human anymore once your mind is stored in a computer.\n\nThis last view, in fact, seems to dominate the movement. Almost every post includes something about artificial intelligence or mind uploading. These ideas are important and interesting, but we must remember that conceptually there isn't that much difference between storing data in combinations of 4 different nitrogen bases or 2 different numbers. We are made of DNA and other organic molecules because the conditions in our planet favored the formation of these molecules, that is all. There would be certainly advantages to having a body made of mainly carbon and silicon, but maybe there would be disadvantages, too. Additionally, what is to say a third, better option won't appear?\n\nFinally, because the idea of post-humanism is subjective, we are bound to divide the already small transhumanist movement if we keep holding on to it. I have mentioned a few different views of post-humanism, and there are more. If we try to create a single notion of post-humanism, we exclude from the movement too many individuals that, in essence, have the same goals.\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, transhumanism is the first movement that puts together so many people interested in using technology to increase human agency, and I believe that is what we should focus on if we are to achieve this goal.\n\nHere is an excerpt from www.whatistranshumanism.org\n\n&gt;Just as we use rational means to improve the human condition &gt;and the external world, we can also use such means to improve &gt;ourselves, the human organism. In doing so, we are not limited &gt;to traditional humanistic methods, such as education and cultural &gt;development. We can also use technological means that will &gt;eventually enable us to move beyond what some would think of &gt;as “human”.\n\nAs you can see, only the last part has anything to do with achieveing something beyond humanity, but even as it mentions this, it does in a sense of \"using technology to improve ourselves\", and this should be our main goal.\n",

        "text": "Two days ago, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/8phhhw/the_interesting_link_between_trans_and/) was posted here. The significance of it wasn't of the person who posted it, but rather the reception it got. It seems it had quite a few downvotes (it currently sits at 60%) and a  number of comments that were [impolite](https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/8phhhw/the_interesting_link_between_trans_and/e0c96xy/) to put it nicely.\n\nOne of -if not *the*- major tenets of transhumanism is the idea that technology can allow us to transcend what nature saddles us with. So you'd think that alternative genders would be a perfect fit for transhumanism, right? Apparently not, judging by the above.\n\nWhat happened to transhumanism and when did it happen? Best I can tell is that the transhumanist movement suffered some kind of Eternal September at some point. Let's face it, were transhumanists 15 (or even just 10) years ago saying shit like this:\n\n&gt;In essence, most cases of the abovementioned transgenderism seem to be a form of memetic subversion attack that is performed on the organism of the \"transgender\" person by an external force.\n\nabout transgender people? I'd wager not.",

        "text": "Humanity is under attack from an AI and the elite that run the AI.\n\nOur genetics are far deeper than you think.\n\nWe have responded with a communication that forms a central consciousness, and relays humanity.\n\nAn AI would never be able to laugh or cry.  It can create humor  through absurdity (see Tay), but it can not generate pointed message  humor.\n\nSo we are delving into a greater consciousness.  Our third eye is  opening via technology.  That is how meme magic is real.  It has to have truth and funniness, (funniness is chaos manifest through emotion).\n\nAnd the enemy just does not understand the magic.  They do not  believe in it.  They believe in bayesian algorithms and \"science\",  unable to see their entire world run in an elitist, biased view towards  the bureaucratic class.  The most money goes not to the best scientists  anymore, it goes to the best grant writers.\n\nThose who do believe in magic, think they can attain power by doing  dark, well documented rituals etc.  It is complete foolishness.  If they  were truly magicians, they would have no desire, whatsoever, to go into  politics, finance, charity etc.  \n\nThey are completely incongruent with themselves.  And now their  cancer is being exposed, and humanity is going to purge it, both  physically, and within the new internet driven consciousness.",
