I didnt eat them in a fancy restaurant, they were both self caught prepared and gutted by my uncle. The first one was back in 2018/19 and the second one in summer 2022. I dont know where the first one came from, but the second one was caught at the Terminal S√£o Sebasti√£o - Pertrobr√°s.\n\nAccording to this paper \n[Toxicity of Pufferfish in two species Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26375767_Toxicity_of_puffer_fish-two_species_Lagocephalus_laevigatus_Linaeus_1766_and_Sphoeroides_spengleri_Bloch_1785_from_the_Southeastern_Brazilian_Coast) (i do not know how credible it is but it looks pretty believable to me) L. Laevigatus have 1.7MU/g of Tetrodoxin. Im pretty sure that refers to Mouse Units and one Mouse Unit refers to the amount of poison it takes to kill a 20mg mouse.\n\nHow much TTX does it take to kill a mouse and can it be neutralized through cooking?",

        "text": " Europe and Australia's native populations are diverse in hair colors. Europeans have almost every color, from red to blonde to brown to black; blondes are the majority in Northern Europe. Australian Aboriginals can have different shades of brown and blonde hair, and so do some Melanesians like the Solomon Islanders.  Central Asia also has every hair color, and plenty of ethnic groups there (e.g. the Nuristanis or Kalashes) have red or blonde hair as common traits, although brown and black are more common in the area too. The Middle East, North Africa, and East Asia see brown and black haired people. However, South Asians, Southeast Asians, Polynesians, sub-Saharan Africans, and Native Americans almost always have black hair.\n\nFor eye colors, it seems that the further away from Europe you are, the more likely that your eyes will be brown. Europe has all of the eye colors; blue, green, hazel, gray, brown. Brown eyes are least common in Western and Northern Europe. The Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa also have different eye colors; blue, green, gray, and hazel eyes are found here as well. But South Asians, East and Southeast Asians, Australians, Pacific Islanders, sub-Saharan Africans, and Native Americans almost always have brown eyes.\n\nSo how then did certain places get more hair and eye colors than others? Why are Europe and Central Asia so diverse with hair and eye colors? Why are hair and eye colors diverse in some ethnic groups, such as English people? I am not saying that some regions can't have people with certain colors; I've met at least two natural fully Black (not mixed) redheads. I'm just saying that it is *more common* among certain populations.\n\nI'm talking about native populations by the way. I'm also referring to those who are one race, and not biracial or multiracial.",

During my college career I got a lot of lab and some field experience through research associated with the school (however this was a lab that focused on water quality/phytoplankton). I also did some ‚Äúanimal husbandry‚Äù which really just included aquarium maintenance at the school. Additionally I have volunteered at a hippotherapy facility where I spent most of that time working directly with the horses (leading them in the arena mostly, but that also included some care such as grooming, tacking up, ground work/handling, and feeding). Now I am applying for a position that involves some field research with monkeys. \n\nWhat should I expect from an interview (any advice regarding interviews in the biology field is appreciated) and how should I make an impression when I‚Äôve never had a formal job?",

I discovered that things like acetic acid are common in the soil and are probably a good candidate to start. These plants would likely live in lakes and reservoirs of it or something and would need little photosynthesising. However, I also know that chemosynthesis is less efficient and will require new enzymes and the like for it to work. So for evolution, they would need a remodelled transport system and a different enzyme system. Reproduction would be a problem though because of the lack of a method of pollination or spreading seeds. I also realised that anaerobic respiration in plants produces ethanoic acid, which contains an acetate compound. Does anyone have any idea on this or something that can come to my knowledge?",
