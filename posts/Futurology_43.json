Have you ever stopped to think about the fact that we're living in a time where the effort required to write is finally on par with the effort required to read?\n\nWhen the internet was first created, it was technically difficult to write on it. Social media helped make it easier for users to create their own content, but the ratio of effort required to write compared to read was still relatively high (around 1:5 or 1:10).\n\nThat's where ChatGPT and similar technologies come in. They've significantly reduced the effort required to write, possibly to as low as 1:2 or even 1:0.5. This is a major milestone for humanity and it got me wondering: what kind of consequences might this have for society?\n\nI'm really curious to hear what others think about this. Have you given any thought to the impact of ChatGPT and similar technologies on society from this perspective?",

Finding out how to use oil made us able to drive or fly anywhere we want in a matter of hours instead of months. Finding out how to gather and use electricity made it possible for us to now have computers and internet. Radio waves was a huge deal as well. \n\nBut now it feels like we're sort of at the top, like we have physics and we have certain resources and we only do something with those. We're making everything more powerful but not exactly new.\n\nSimilarly to how discovering electricity made technology branch out into so many amazing gadgets we couldn't imagine living without today, I'd like to see another resource which would branch out similarly as well.",

        "text": "Both of them are vastly inefficient. In a world where energy is increasingly expensive and in short supply, and resources increasingly limited, it is unlikely that such inefficient technologies will be widely adopted (e.g. as the backbones for major societal systems). In addition we can make the following observations.\n\nThe heart of crypto is decentralisation of the financial system. So immediately we can say that no (serious) government will ever (seriously) move toward its wide adoption. It can only be a people-powered change. The question therefore becomes, why would people want it? Centrally-managed money (a) works and (b) offers many safeguards. The average person will never prefer the frankly abstract advantages of decentralisation over the tangible advantages of transaction simplicity and safety. And, as adjustments to the way crypto works that address some of these issues sacrifice other advantages of crypto, I put it that the technology is inherently unsuitable as a replacement for central financial systems.\n\nBlockchain of course has more applications than crypto. And I can see that there may be ongoing uses for this technology in niche applications. However it will never be the primary technology of a major system, simply because there would never be a good reason to slow down that system, and vastly multiply its resource cost, compared to just running a central server.\n\nMy arguments here are based on inefficiency. If in the future we crack fusion power and mine asteroids, these arguments would no longer be so strong. However, even then, I struggle to see what the motivation would be for this inefficiency. So the real heart of the argument is: as far as most people are concerned, centralisation works. I don’t see that changing.",

        "text": "So i had this crazy epiphany a couple of months back and it really got me thinking as to whether there is any way to solve it . It goes like this :-\n\n\nSuppose you wake up in a dark room, cuffed to a chair. There's a bunch of stuff on a table in front of you and drawer cabinet beside you with drawers locked with codes. There's a letter on the table that says that the key to the cuffs is in the drawers but you'll need to solve the puzzles/messages/ciphers present on the table, in order to get the code for the drawer . Pretty simple , right ? \n\nBut here's the catch, you are solving everything simultaneously with a demonic creature sitting ahead of you in the dark room. The letter also tells you that the creature does whatever you do and is a perfect mimic. If you lift a piece of paper , it does the same , if you look right , it looks , if you solve a puzzle it does too. And basically everything!\n\nHowever , the letter tells you that if you sit idle/accept defeat / lose the game basically , the creature kills you . And if the game ties up , then also the creature kills you . So if you win the game , solve everything correctly  and eventually get the key , you surely become free from the cuffs , but it wins too , SO THE GAME TIES UP hence it kills you. So the question comes as to how you'll actually win without dying? There's only one way you could win.\n\nThis thought ispired me so much that I just went on my computer and started making it and after a whole shit ton of thought came with the true \"successful\" ending where you actually win. The game is called [MIMIC](https://thelostsun-studios.itch.io/mimic) and it is on sale rn . Have fun guys!",

The main question we have been playing with is, why does there seem to be an insistence on launching straight from Earth, then up and out directly to \\[insert celestial body\\]? The plans always seem to be in mind for Mars, the asteroid belt, and even some of the conversations I've heard about Luna. Seems that, maybe, we're finally changing a bit... but why not more staging?\n\nThere is serious logic in using rockets to ferry materials up to the International Space Station (or, if we're not happy with the ISS, build a new orbital platform) to assemble in space, instead of on the ground. No, I'm not asking for IKEA to take over for NASA, but with the fragility and awkward shaping of so many items (we're not seeing people flying space cubes out there), safely packing all of the equipment, and then unfurling solar panels, and laying out longer range vehicle frames could save a lot of fuel, logistical nightmares, and time. Launching out for the moon from orbit around Earth (instead of straight from Earth), and yes even the belt and beyond, gives a great halfway house, requires less thrust to break gravitational pull, and allows more prep for backup items, doesn't it?\n\nPerfectly happy to be disagreed with - that's the essence of healthy debate, right? My position, however, is that, if we truly want to see a future that includes humanity with a long term Lunar stay, and taking better shots at walking on other celestial bodies, doesn't this seem like the more logical tactic than the Kennedy era?\n\nThanks so much for reading, looking forward to your responses.",

        "text": "Hey guys and girls, this is my first ever post. I don't have a degree in engineering or anything but I'm having fun with thinking about abstract concepts of technology. Lately I've been thinking about how common problems with spacecrafts can be overcome and I would like to know your thoughts on this and play around with the wildest ideas. Of course there are probably more reasons why each idea wont work but I'd like this thread to go in the direction of \"how could this work?\".\n\nI want to start by addressing the problem of weight and fuel. The more fuel a spacecraft carries, the more weight/mass it needs to lift and the more mass it has to lift, the more fuel it needs to carry. This is one of the oldest problems of rocket science as far as I know and there have been multiple solutions for this problem, some better, some worse.\n\nFurthermore traditional propulsion concepts are quite costly, which is why reuseable propulsion systems like the Falcon 9 are such a big deal.\n\nSo my idea is based on the question if we might be able to not even carry the fuel for propulsion at all?Is it possible to design a concept, where we minimize the weight of fuel the spacecraft needs to lift.\n\nI currently imagine something like a huge starting ramp similar to those freefall towers you see in theme parks. Could it be possible to build such a ramp like 1000m-1500m high? There are already concepts of sky scrapers reaching similar hights, so it shouldnt be impossible to do this. I have to say, this concept would probably only work for unmanned spacecrafts. The spacecraft could be designed like a ring outside of the ramp and accelarated by magnetic rails. This would not only decrease the chance of severe explosions, but would also be without any friction.\n\nThe ring shaped spacecraft could be put into rotation at the beginning the starting procedure to stabilize the upwards movement and additional adjustable wings could be added on the outside to provide further lift like a helicoper. This could be helpful in the lower parts of dense atmosphere and even help during landing procedures on other planets or back on earth.\n\nOf course, the length of the starting ramp wouldn't be enough to shoot our spacecraft into earths orbit, so there is still a need for additional boosters onboard of the spacecraft for further accelartion after leaving the ramp.\n\nI really like to heare your thought about this. Sure, there are a lot of issues and disadvantages compared to traditional propulsion systems, but I thing this concept might also be a potential starting point for further developement. And if not, it's still fun to dream and imagine!",
