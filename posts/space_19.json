So if someone does end up answering the question, it would be much appreciated for my poor brain if it isn’t written with too complex science jargon! \n\nBack to the question. I was watching a YouTube video explaining what would happen if you theoretically fell into a black hole. Obviously you would die, but if you survived hypothetically, it said that you would carry on floating through but millions and billions of years would have passed and most of the stars and planets would have died out. \n\nHow does this work? Are you floating in the centre of the black hole for millions of years? Or is it like a nearly infinite thing that you’re floating in? Sorry if the questions don’t make sense haha I can barely wrap my own head around it!",
