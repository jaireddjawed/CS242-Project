        "text": "Dan Carlin said something along the lines of, \"one day someone will write a book about the positive things to come out of the holocaust.\" \n\nHis point was that as years go on and we gain ancestral distance from an event we stop empathising with victims. I was listening to this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yiHA62uhNo) by Ghost when the comment came back to me. The song is a tribute to an Hungarian noble woman and serial killer [Elizabeth Báthory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory), who is widely thought of as the counter part to Vlad the Impaler for the rumour that she bathed in the blood of virgin girls to preserve her youth. \n\nI doubt that is true, but I do believe she really did kill many peasant girls as she was put on trial for this. And yet I enjoy a song about her with the lyrics. \n\n&gt;Her pact with Satan\n\n&gt;Her dispisal of mankind\n\n&gt;Her acts of cruelty and her lust for blood\n\n&gt;Makes her one of us\n\nAnd \n\n&gt;Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul\n\n&gt;Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death\n\n&gt;You're still alive, Elizabeth\n\nWill we one day have songs about Jeffrey Dahmer? Hell, we already do thanks to Katy Perry's song Dark Horse which I found offensive for the line: \n\n&gt;She eats your heart out\n\n&gt;Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo)\n\nThat is a single throwaway line though, and I mostly didn't like it because of the target demographic of Perry's music. \n\nWe also in the UK, have a tradition called Guy Fawkes night where we burn effigies of an historical Catholic terrorist/freedom fighter who tried to blow up the houses of parliament. He was tortured and executed. We praise and often seek to emulate the Roman Empire, an institution that invaded other people's sovereign lands and committed what was essentially a genocide against the Carthaginians. Not an isolated incident either, they also endorsed slavery and organised deadly blood sports for their entertainment. You will never see anyone demand that a monument of Caesar is taken down because he kept slaves. \n\nI do not object to people who venerate, for example, Vikings. Hell, there is a TV show about them that depicts them raping and pillaging and keeping slaves and yet we *root* the people in that show to keep on doing what they are doing. The sack of Paris is a victory for the protagonists. \n\nSo at a certain point it does become okay to do these things. Centuries from now we may have a TV show with Nazi protagonists that we root for as they roll through France. Or perhaps a song all about 9/11 that tributes how \"awesome\" and \"cool\" it was. \n\nSo, when do you believe it becomes okay for this to happen and should we be more conscientious of the fact that these things happened to real people who had families, feelings and more than likely were terrified to die?\n\nI would dare anyone to make a film like \"Life of Brian\" about the Islamic State for example. \n\n ",

        "text": "I personally think a lot of profit could be made from a large-scale human milk business, especially if it's pasteurized and processed and even flavored to the great extents cow milk is. And considering how healthy human milk is for us (it's made by humans, for humans after all), there'd be hardly any health concerns that cow milk doesn't already have. Pregnant women commonly lactate a cumbersome amount as is, and they could probably use the money.\n\nBeyond the obvious use of feeding children, human milk could be used in place of normal milk for things like coffees and ice creams and cheeses. Or it could be just consumed like cow milk, having various different types, like whole, skim, chocolate, strawberry, etc. Some people might find human milk to be more to their liking (perhaps in taste, perhaps in principle), and drink that instead of cow milk.\n\nI'm not advocating for a large-scale corporate production of human milk, since I think big corporations are greedy and I'm afraid of women being financially forced into cattle-like farms against their desires. I think if this business were a thing, a smaller scale, more worker-friendly version of it would be best, one where women have the option to work as a milk producer for as long as is convenient for them, but can reasonably quit when they want, or otherwise simply sell containers of their milk to the company and let them handle the cleaning and processing and such and such.\n\nEither way, I'm surprised a human milk business isn't more present or common, and I was curious why that is, considering everything I've said.

        "text": "I'm thinking more of words that you rarely get the chance to use without making it sound forced, but can occasionally help you articulate a thought perfectly.  For instance:\n\n**hagiography** (n) A biography of a saint.  Can also be used to describe a biographical work that contains nothing but over-the-top praise of its subject. *If you want to learn about Nikola Tesla, for God's sake, don't use YouTube!  You'll find nothing but hagiographies there.*\n\n**saponification** (n) The process of reacting fat with an alkali hydroxide to produce soap.  This word is actually more fun just to say than to use, so its shorter, more useful form, \"saponify (v)\" isn't nearly as popular. *The body had barely decomposed, due to tissue saponification in the alkaline soil.*\n\n**eponymous** (adj)  Giving its name to the name of something else.  This one is very difficult to use, but it is very helpful in at least one circumstance: to avoid confusion when a book, movie, song, etc. is named after a character in it.  So rather than explain that a name applies to both a character and a title, you can clear everything up with one word.  *She looked pretty cute in her profile picture, but when I actually met her, she reminded me of the eponymous \"Lola\" from that song by The Kinks.*",

        "text": "Record sales have outpaced digital sales. What's the root factor here?\n\nThere is a very contentious debate about the quality of analog vs digital audio. Some say the bit rate of digital is enough that the human ear can't tell the difference. Others say that the precision of analog can produce rich tones and harmonics that digital cannot.\n\nWho is full of shit? Is it a fad? Is it a solid industry? In ten years, will cassettes make a comeback?\n\nEDIT: So far I have found a few common reasons for buying vinyl. 1) The physical copy, 2) Album art, 3) conversation piece, 4) You get a digital download with new vinyl, and 5) it's more popular right now than it has been since the debut of other audio media.",

We do on average live longer than lets say 50 years ago, BUT we also produce on average (per person) way more than 50 years ago. This is because we have seen many technological improvements.\n\nBut at this moment the average worker makes about the same (maybe less?) than the average worker 50 years ago (if you also correct for inflation). \n\nLike this for example: [graph](http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/sites/main/files/imagecache/lightbox/main-images/min_wage_real_value_graph.jpg)\n\nSo do we really need to work longer?
