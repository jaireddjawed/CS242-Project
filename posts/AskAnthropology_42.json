But surfing the net made me conclude that mesolithic/neolithic hunter-gatherers in Europe were mostly nomadic. \n\nDuring this period Europeans hunted large wild animals (bisons, deer, boars etc; correct me if I'm wrong). And these animals would migrate further north in spring, and south in winter, and there's also a reason why hunters were nomadic.\n\nSo, if this is the case, than there's a problem for animals in Balkans. Danube and Sava river would limit their migration to the north. So that made this area good for hunters, and also they had plenty of fish in the rivers, which, in my opinion, enabled them to be settled in one location without having to move to great distances.\n\nWas this really the case? What were they hunting? And were these seasonal south-north animal migrations present at this time (~ 8000-6000 BC)?\n\nAlso, I wonder if there is some kind of map showing the evolving of fauna in Europe during prehistory, but I guess that would be a question some other (which?) sub...",

Now while I found his sources interesting, I feel as if he didn't give the whole picture and may be biased. If anyone, especially professional anthropologists could share their thoughts on what Ive referenced or the idea of hunter gatherers being peaceful in general, that would be great. \n\n\nAnthropologists such as Eleanor Leacock, Patricia Draper and Mina Caulfield have described a generally equal relationship between men and women. \n\n\nEleanor Burke Leacock, “Women's Status in Egalitarian Society,”Current Anthropology 19 (1978); and her Myths of Male Dominance (Monthly Review Press: New York, 1981). S. and G. Cafferty, “Powerful Women and the myth of Male Dominance in Aztec Society,”Archaeology from Cambridge (1988). \n\n\nIn such settings where the person who procures something also distributes it and where women procure about 80 percent of the sustenance via gathering, it is largely women who determine band society movements and camp locations. Evidence indicates that both women and men made the stone tools used by pre-agricultural peoples. \n\n\nJoan Gero and Margaret W. Conkey, eds., Engendering Archaeology (Blackwell: Cambridge MA, 1991);C.OF.M. Bird, “Woman the Toolmaker,”in Women in Archaeology (REsearch School of Pacific and Asian Studies: Canberra, 1993). \n\nOverall, males and females in band society move freely and peacefully from one band to another as well as into or out of relationships. \n\n\nClaude Meillassoux, Maidens, Meal and Money (cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1981), p. 16. \n\n\nAccording to Rosalind Miles, the men not only do not command or exploit women’s labour, \n\n&gt;“they exert little or no control over women’s bodies or those of their children, making no fetish of virginity or chastity, and making no demands of women’s sexual exclusivity.”\n\n\nRosalind Miles, The Women’s History of the World (Michael Joseph: (London, 1986), p. 16. \n\n\nZubeeda Banu Quraishy provides an African example: \n\n&gt;“Mbuti gender associations were characterised by harmony and cooperation.”\n\n\nZubeeda Banu Quraishy, “Gender Politics in the Socio-Economic Organization of Contemporary Foragers,”in Ian Keen and Takako Yamada, eds., identity and Gender in Hunting and Gathering Societies (National Museum of Ethnology: Osaka, 2000). P. 196. \n\n\nHobbes argued that the human condition has been and will always be that of a war of all against all.\n\n&gt;”According to Eibl-Eibesfelt however, the !Ko Bushmen as not bellicose: “Their cultural ideal is peaceful coexistence, and they achieve this by avoiding conflict, at is by splitting up,la and by emphasising and encouraging the numerous patterns of bonding.”\n\n\nEibl-Eibesfelt, “Aggression in the !Ko-Bushmen,”in Martin A. Nettleship, eds., War, It's Causes and Correlates (The Hague: Mouton, 1975), p. 293. \n\n\nW.J. Pery, generally accurate, if somewhat idealized: \n\n&gt;“Warfare, immorality, vice, polygny, slavery, and the subjection of women seem to be absent among our gatherer hunter ancestors.”\n\n\nW.J. Perry, “The Golden Age,”in The Hibbert Journal XVI (1917), p. 44. \n\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence that any tools or hunting weapons were used against humans at all. \n\n\nArthur Ferrill, The Origins of War from the Stone Age to Alexander the Great (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1985), p. 16. \n\n\n&gt;“Depictions of battle scenes, skirmishes and hand-too-hand combat are rare in hunter gatherer art and when they do occur most often result from contact with agriculturalists or industrialised invaders,”concludes Tacon and Chippindale’s study of Australian rock art. \n\n\nPaul Tacon and Christopher Chippindale, “Australia's Ancient Warriors: Changing Depictions of Fighting in the Rock Art of Arnhem Land, N.TO.,”Cambridge Archaeological Journal 4:2 (1994), p. 211. \n\n\nWhen conflict began to emerge, encounters rarely lasted more than half an hour, and if a death occurred both parties would retire at once. \n\n\nMaurice R, Davie. The Evolution of War: A Study of It's Role in Early SOcieties (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1929), p. 247. \n\n\nKrober reported that their fighting was \n\n&gt;“notably bloodless.

In this the hero is granted, as a boon by the King of the Animals, the gift of understanding animal language; he is warned that if he divulges to any that he possesses this gift he will die on the instant; he is made rich by the possession of it; he laughs at a conversation between animals which he overhears; his wife demands to know the cause of his laughter. To this point the two stories are identical, but in the West African tale the man divulges the secret and pays the penalty with his life, whereas the Serbian conclusion is very much less tame, as will be seen.\n\nDoes anyone knows which Western African story this is, where was it published, whether it is available online etc?",

Should we rely more on western observations and scientific findings for a clearer picture? Thanks to all in advance!",

My question here is twofold - the first is quite simple, and the second is surely a long shot but maybe there's some math that could make it work:\n\n1. How many descendants would *any* average Eurasian from the thirteenth century have today? As an example: one mother giving birth to one daughter, every 20 years, would lead to 40 descendants in total since 1200 - is there a more \"average\" number we could construct, given birth rates?\n\n2. Can we look at the number of descendants from Genghis Khan today to reconstruct how many children he himself had, independent of written sources?",
