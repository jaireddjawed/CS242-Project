        "text": "First of all, thanks to all that commented. I spent a lot of time reading and rereading all your words and they helped me feel better. I just didn't get enough time to sit down and write replies.\n\nMy Sis officially asked me yesterday if my kids could be in her wedding. I skirted around answering, claiming that there were several issues that we would have to talk about. I wish I could have just told her no, but I really can't figure out a way to say it. No matter how I phrase it in my head, it sounds like I'm throwing a childish tantrum that I can't be in the wedding as well. I really don't care about the wedding itself, I just care about the pattern of exclusion. I also realized that it specifically goes back to something my Nmom used to do.\n\nShe hated to go anywhere alone. She would always make sure someone went with her. So, to encourage this, anyone that went with her, got to get something. Both me and my sister knew, that if we went, we would be able to ask for something, and she would say yes. Every time. So one of us always went with her. It was really bad if it was trips or events or something. She would eat out every meal, buy gifts and presents, go out for ice cream and all sorts of things. But if you weren't along for the ride, then you got some cheesy gift, and had to listen to everything you missed out on. What was worse, this was the ONLY time she ever gave gifts of things. I remember one year that I didn't get any clothes for school, because I didn't go with her to a shopping trip. It wasn't like she said \"We need to go clothes shopping for school, lets go\" it was  rather \"I want to go to the store, who else?\" and what started off as a grocery store trip, ended up as a clothes shopping trip that I was excluded from. \n\nAnyway, thank you all for your words. I will be asking my therapist to work with me on exactly what to say to my sister. I am going to stand firm on this and set a boundary. ",

I had to juat pull out a cash advance, putting me more in debt. I am hoping this new apartment helps. \n\nMy car is falling apart as well. It's barely over 100k miles, I owe over 3 grand on it, but it's only worth 1400 now. I have to get a quote on fixing a freeon leak and fixing the secondary fuel injector, since my fixes weren't enough and i dont have the tools to pull out an engine. Two weeka ago i was cleaning it out because over 3 quarts of oil was sitting in the pipe valve. Im just lucky my car engine didn't catch fire. I have put almost 1000 in repairs to this car just in the last 8 months, and I live pycheck to paycheck. I am really obly eating the free meals at work and that is it. My SO is still essentially inemployed, and has school coming up. I do as well.\n\nI just feel like a failure. I bust my ass and deal with so much shit and people treating me like shit. Things were looking up and I was actually content. I feel almost like God does exist and he just wants to see how many times he can get me to try to kill myself. I spent all day purposefully taking deliveries in the hopes someone would just slam into me and kill me. That way people couldnt be pissed of at me for dying like if I attempted again. \n\nIm not even like wanting to die. I just fucking hate myself so much. I gave up a degree in aerospace because I was too pussyshit to deal with my depression. I gave up a position that paid almost 2 grand a month for a position that pays just over half because I couldnt deal with the sexual harassment. I didnt talk my SO into not quitting from the high paying job he hated so much he would cry almost every morning.\n\nIt feels like the adult world is essentially no different than childhood. You are either happy and suffering for it or making it and dead inside.\n\nI just want to be able to not worry if I can feed us anymore. Im slipping back into a dark place. I just hope my emergency appointment helps, even if just a little.\n\nI just needed to vent.",

Our relationship exploded when I didn't comply with her wishes to control my marriage and my religious affiliations (or lack thereof), and I finally just decided to cut contact. All this is on top of a lifetime of severe emotional abuse and neglect (harsh criticism, manipulating me with guilt, and a general lack of respect towards me). Edad has stayed in the picture, but remains weirdly obtuse as to why Nmom and I don't get along. For what it's worth, I've alternated between being the scapegoat and the lost child.\n\nMy siblings still live in the same town as my parents, and I get along with them great. I've been meaning to visit my brother and finally booked a flight to stay for a few days and do some sightseeing. He has his own apartment, so I don't have to stay with my parents, and I am excited about seeing him and having fun without having to worry about how depressed I will be when I leave (I usually become really depressed and sullen after spending time at my parents' house). I'm due to fly out there tomorrow. \n\nWell, not surprisingly, my dad found out I was coming and decided to call me to ask about it. I told him I was staying with my brother, and he asked, shocked and almost hurt, \"What do you mean you're staying with your brother? Why don't you come stay with us?\"\n\nUgh. Really?  Has he not been around for the last 2 years of my life, when everything so spectacularly exploded?  My family doesn't \"do\" emotional conversations--instead they are very passive aggressive. But I knew I would eventually have to tell my dad, openly, why I no longer want to see our mom or feel comfortable in my childhood home. It's baffling that I even have to explain this, considering all this has gone down in front of him, but it all just awkwardly and hastily came out: how much Nmom had hurt me, how hurt I was that they didn't attend my wedding or welcome my in-laws to the family (despite the fact that my in-laws were very gracious towards me), and how Nmom has treated me like shit my whole life. He reacted with a lot of \"Mhmm, I see. I'll talk to her.\"  I told him that I was happy having her out of my life, and that he didn't have to talk to her about anything, but I don't think he really got it. \n\nI am worried that this will open the door to her being in my life again, and I don't want that. At the same time, I don't want to hurt Edad. I don't even know if I'm writing this to get specific advice, or to just vent, or what. \n\nThanks for giving me a space to write about this.",

        "text": "This may be a little disjointed, but had to get things off my chest.\n\nBackground:  When I was 6, Nparents brought me to the dentist to have some cavities filled.  They couldn't hit the proper nerves after several shots, so I was put in 4-point restraints and they drilled the tooth out with no painkiller whatsoever.  It was tedious, painful and still gives me nightmares.   Since then, they never brought me back in to a dentist.  I have been twice as an adult before the current issue (I am 40 now), both times for extractions (4 wisdom + impacted molar, and another molar separately) of which I was knocked out entirely each time.\n\nNo knockout THIS time, though!\n\nA tooth I knew was going bad for a while flared up a few weeks ago.  Abscessed, my face was swollen up like a balloon in a matter of hours after it started.  Went to a dentist, got antibiotics, and had to go back today to get it pulled.\n\nOn the initial visit, I explained why I went so long without any dental care, but ended up in tears in the chair.   Had to explain it again to others today which didn't help either.\n\nThe anxiety actually started in the waiting room as I was forced to listen to a looping video describing and showing all manner of dental nightmares and issues in graphic detail.  Once sufficiently spooked, I was brought in, sat down, and they started shooting me up with lidocaine.\n\nSIX shots.\n\nThe worst:  The last shot was to my tongue, which didn't have any numbing gel put on it first!\n\nThe dentist finally comes in and starts the extraction.  I was so terrified that I couldn't even breathe, and he had to stop until I could take breaths again.  My hands were clenched together in front of my so hard, they thought I was going to hurt myself; the knuckles were still white well after letting go!\n\nHe got it out in short order, and it was a good 15 minutes before I was calm enough again to even talk.  I don't even remember talking about the post-op instructions, thankfully they gave me a paper with them as well.\n\nThe worst part:  Got up to the desk to pay, and the Dental Assistant tells them a DIFFERENT tooth number than what was supposed to be pulled!!!   I'm completely losing my shit at this point, ready to lose it on someone, only to have her go, \"Oh, oops, my bad, don't worry we pulled the correct one\" even though I couldn't look at it for another 90 minutes due to the gauze.\n\nI know I'm going to have more nightmares about it tonight.....  This is going to suck.",

        "text": "I've rehashed this so many times that I'm going to just keep it short: college was a test to see how much bullshit I could tolerate before committing suicide. Apparently a lot, because I commuted for my last two years from my parents' house while studying neuroscience, taking all of my upper level courses at once, while my parents were getting a divorce. A typical evening involved my mother crying on my shoulder while my father screams and shouts and tries to fight me. That piece of shit is gone (not actually a bad person per se but definitely narcissism), I did well in school and, despite studying an impractical major, got some generic marketing research job (with a greater salary/benefits package than I expected) where I get high before work and blankly stare at a computer monitor.\n\nI left my house with a few of my belongings back in September to go live in the boiler room of my buddy's basement for $200 a month, which is a steal for a room around here. The situation at home exploded and I decided that I don't deserve to violently hate my life all of the time. It kind of sucks but is also cool, it's the AC that's annoying but whatever.\n\nHere's my dilemma: the lease ends in May and I want to avoid having to help my roommates move out. I told my mother I am planning on moving back in with her because my job is only 12 min away from my house and I could just save a shit-ton of money. I also do not want to get an apartment around here because this area is too pricey -- has all of the high costs of a major east coast city without any of the benefits (suburbs, amirite?), plus I would feel like I was definitely settling down in the area if I were to get a place. However, while everyone was off smiling and laughing and having sex with each other, I was at home, wide-eyed staring at my ceiling and screaming internally at the fact that I have no one to talk to. I don't want to spend another fucking year in my shitty ass piece of shit shit hole of a shitty hometown where people go to die spiritually. I want to fuck people and celebrate my youth.\n\nAnyway how long should I stay at this job to make it stick to my resume? I just took the first job out of college because I was super desperate for a source of income and I didn't want to feel like some loser who fucked up college and then has to work for an hourly pay while living with my parents (not that people who do this are losers, it's just that specifically, for me, I decided to transfer colleges for a better future when I realized I was turning into a degenerate, and having that decision make no difference would have sucked, but delving into whether that decision I made was the best one for my overall quality of life is a different story entirely and is something I struggle with everyday, because by doing so I lost some of the closest friends I've ever had, people who constituted what I now consider to be what a functioning family would work like). Now, however, my eyes have really opened up to the sheer number of generic Microsoft office jobs I could possibly take, in really cool cities where I could plausibly ride my bike to places where there are other young people and not my mother.\n\nThis post is mostly prompted by a lack of sleep, caffeine, and a romantic prospect falling through last night. Fuck.  ",

She acted like nothing had happened, being all chummy, acting like my best friend. It was weird. Since I don't trust her an inch, and I'm still hurt by how she treated me, I was polite, civil and professional but I didn't reciprocate her chatty pally behavior. She started to look a bit scared.\n\nI was triggered by her acting like nothing happened. Too similar to N-Mom. I don't really know what I was anticipating - maybe an apology?! But realistically I don't think she has enough insight or self-esteem to apologize to me?\n\nSO says she is scared now, because she knows I'll tell the truth, and her only way of dealing with it is to behave like my BFF. It's very weird that the person who was bullying me &amp; I was scared of now seems to be scared of me.\n\nI'm still pretty anxious though - expecting the Narcissistic rage and revenge to hit soon. But, if she's just a garden-variety nasty person, and not an N, then that probably won't happen. Only time will tell!\n\nWish me luck folks! \n\nSaw a job I really liked the look of - but decided not to go for it as the commute is a bit too far, and the pay just a bit too low. But it makes me hopeful of finding something good. :)",

My nparents made me diet since I was 10 and my whole life I've been told I'm fat and ugly. They would also tell me that (since diabetes and heart disease runs in my family) it would be my fault if I got it. My n/emother got diagnosed with type 2 just a few years ago. I'm hypoglycemic and I have a sensory processing disorder that makes eating VERY difficult (in fact everything on the gestational diabetes diet I pretty much don't/can't eat. My throat will close up). \n\nSo when I got the news that I failed the first test, it was like my worst nightmare. I knew logically that it isn't my fault, but emotionally I'm wrecked. Then I get here today (haven't eaten in over 12 hours) and they tell me they have to do FOUR blood draws. I have such a hard time with needles. It's taking everything I have to not loose it. And of course the lower my sugar goes, the harder it is to retain emotional control. I'm probably going to be sobbing at some point. The staff has been wonderful and reassuring but this is really hard for me. They don't think I have it and the last test was a fluke but I can't help but thinking about all of this and everything it means for me and this baby. \n\nSo TL;DR: I'm stuck in my 3 hour glucose test to test for gestational diabetes (aka my worst nightmare/massive trigger) and I'm struggling. Please post things to keep me distracted over the next few hours. Or hugs. I'll always take hugs. TIA \n\nUPDATE: you guys are all amazing human beings for helping me out. I am so very touched. I should get my results tomorrow and I'll update everyone. You guys are such an amazing support and I knew you guys would get it in ways everyone else can't. Big hugs to those who will have them!! Thank you!\n\nUPDATE 2: I PASSED MY GLUCOSE TEST!!!! I DO NOT HAVE GESTATIONAL DIABETES!!!!!!!",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, I finally put everything together and figured out what was wrong with my family - my paternal grandmother and my father were narcissists, my mother was an enabler, my sister was the golden child, and I was the lost child who occasionally was treated as a scapegoat.  It was a relief to finally have words for everything!\n\nI went NC with the majority of my family four years ago when I was 18. I left the country permanently this year, and I'm using my upcoming marriage as an opportunity to change my name and make it that much harder for the narcissists in my family to contact me (my decoy email suggests they're still trying even after all this time).  I make a serious effort to avoid narcissists.  I thought I had a pretty good handle on it.\n\nBut I'm starting to feel like my mother-in-law is a narcissist and I can't tell if that's paranoia or my fears are legitimate.  \n\nShe was severely neglected and abused throughout her childhood, having had to emancipate herself at 16. Life hasn't been kind to her since then, either. And from that I gathered she just really liked to get attention. It mostly manifested in sort of annoying but harmless ways.\n\nBut as I get closer to her, I notice it's a lot worse.  \n\nShe's begun doing something my ndad is famous for - making herself the expert in any conversation.  I'm an American expat, and whenever we get on the topic of American culture or history, she is always right.  In reality she's always wrong, but she cannot be convinced otherwise and dismisses anything I have to say. If I really press it and ask someone to look up who's right, she cries.  It can be as simple as her saying there have been many Jewish presidents before - if I correct her it's all eye-rolling and patronizing nonsense. If I don't just concede it carries on that way until she cries or says it doesn't matter anyway and changes the subject.\n\nShe's also hijacked my wedding - I wanted a small civil service and to perhaps have drinks at her house with the family instead of a giant reception. She agreed to let us have a small gathering in her yard, but then that turned into renting tents and outdoor heaters and paying for caterers and very formal dress, which then turned into renting out a formal ballroom despite my trying to politely protest this for months. One of the venues she's looking at is a castle. I was hardly able to pick my own wedding dress.  The guest list includes more people that she wants to impress than people I actually know.  At this point it's just a party for her. She's always saying \"I never got the wedding I wanted, so I am going to make sure you have the wedding YOU want\" and then ignoring what I want entirely.\n\nTo me, this and a lot of other little things are starting to add up to narcissism.  But I'm not sure if I trust myself to be objective about it at all.  Is this just normal in-laws stuff?  Is she just a little bit of a know-it-all who really likes big formal celebrations, and I'm blowing it all out of proportion? Am I just seeing my dad and my grandmother in people who do things I don't like?\n\nI'm just scared that by the time I figure out she is a narcissist I'll have been sucked into her web.  I have no idea how to proceed with my relationship with her at all.",

As soon as she started telling me about the email, I could feel my stomach tighten. It was so noticeable after weeks of no contact. I even remembered the fear from my childhood...vividly. Even though she has no real power over me now, just the thought of the possibility of her coming to the graduation was just awful. Just the fact that she is trying to get information about it makes me sick, because I know she will do just what she wants with no regard for me.\n\nI don't think there is really any real danger she will show up. I'm just wondering about that feeling. Is it just fear? I want a name for it. Does one always feel fear in one's stomach?",

It's like I don't believe I can do better than what my mind paints me as; a failure. Anyone who saw my behavior might be inclined to call it apathy or laziness, but someone who is lazy or apathetic doesn't obsess over being a good student/worker/person etc. I have read that sometimes your subconscious has ideas about your intrinsic worth that translates into your actions (IE a perfectionist with no faith in their abilities procrastinates to the final minute, then views the grade as proof of their incompetence.)\n\nIf that is so, how do I go about changing that? I have big exams coming in the next week or two, and I am petrified at the idea of doing poorly, and yet, I have all this time to get ahead and I can't force myself to study or prepare for them? Am I just unmotivated and a whiner? Or is there something that I am not addressing about the way I see myself?\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this?

He refuses to let her make decisions on her own, refuses to let her spend her own money (of which she has a lot, my grandfather recently died and left her a pretty decent inheritance) but spends it himself freely (he has no money), constantly lies to her, steals from her, and tries to come in between our recently repaired relationship. She's medicated for PTSD, but constantly calls her a drug addict based on the fact that he himself used to abuse methamphetamine and crack cocaine, and believes himself to be better than her because of the fact (he's soon to be 5 years into Alcoholics Anonymous, and I believe that these feelings could be because of this, they're all a little crazy.) This is the 6th or 7th time in the 6 months they've been married that they've broken up, and according to him, it's always her fault. Usually he says it's because of drug abuse. He constantly tells her that she's stupid, among other things. This last time the divorce has been progressing much further than ever before, usually they get back together after he says he's going to change and he doesn't and it just happens again, but this time divorce papers were filed, and attorney were hired. My mom's lawyer after hearing of his bullshit immediately claimed narcissist, and told my mom to have no contact with him, as he's a master of telling sweet lies, and could, and has easily convinced her to return to him. On Saturday I guess she texted him because she missed him, and spent all day yesterday with him, and is at dinner with him tonight as I type this. I guess what I'm asking is: how do I explain to my mother that he's never gonna change and will only continue hurting her? I just want her to be happy, but I know that he'll never truly change. ",

        "text": "I feel like it's time to face some things about my therapist that have been rubbing me the wrong way for a while. Therapy has been really helpful for a while but in the back of my mind, some things  stood out. I kept my misgivings hidden from people so I want to come clean about what I'm feeling. here goes. i like my therapist, but some things are adding up all of the sudden. I am curious to get other peoples' opinion. \n\nSo far, the things that work for me about this therapist are these:\n* She's friendly and has loads of empathy\n\n* She listens and remembers things that I tell her.\n\n* She's not afraid of any emotion, like fear, anger or sadness, and is accepting of me when I express them. \n\n* She helps me find tools to handle my emotions and get out of toxic situations at work.\n\n\nThat's a lot of good, right? For a while, I think the good may have been covering up the red flags. Something happened this week that really triggered me, and in true acon fashion all the red flags that I stifled are coming up at once.\n\nHere are the things that worry me.\n\n* no therapy accreditation (she's an alternative \"counselor\" but doesn't have any professional training or certification other than her own recovery.) I was willing to look past this at first because I needed help so badly.\n\n* boundary issues. she encourages me to call her at any hour of the day or night. it's almost like she wants me to lean on her.\n\n* naming my feelings. Sometimes, I'll let her know that I'm feeling a certain thing, and she'll tell me why. For example, I told her I was sad one day, and she told me it was because I had gone to the zoo the day before and was around the negative energy of all the animals in captivity. Wtf. That's not what I was sad about, but at the time, I swallowed it and accepted it as truth.\n\n* she wants to be my friend, and she invites me to her house for the holidays. It feels like she is looking for a surrogate daughter. she's also told me that her own grown children, who are around my age, don't really talk to her or visit her, and how it's hurtful.\n\n* she invites me to social gatherings with just me and her, and I decline.\n\n* she shares a lot about what she went through, in horrific and graphic detail. sometimes it's hard to get a word in edgewise\n\n* she pushes her experiences on me. she's an alcoholic, and she assumes that i'm an alcoholic too and i need to go to AA meetings even though i quit drinking long before i met her. I haven't had one drink in almost two years, and I don't get cravings of any sort.\n\n* she can be a little bit too validating sometimes. Here's an example from this week. When big changes in my life happen, i tend to become irrationally fearful and back away from the change. The fear always passes, and more often than not, I end up loving the change. Absolutely loving it. This week a big change was proposed, and I called her because I felt terrified. she fed into my fears. She encouraged me to make ultimatums with people to block this change from happening. I ended up getting in huge fights with several people, only to cool down several days later and think, \"what the hell? i'm really ok with this change and I don't know why I picked all these fights.\" I'm certainly not blaming the therapist, but I wish I had someone who would've encouraged me to examine my fears and not act on them until the tough time passed.\n\n* ok since this particular therapist isn't accredited or trained or anything, she's basically acting as my official \"sponsor\" for my support group for children of dysfunctional families. Typically, most sponsors take on sponsees as an act of service and to give back to a support group. In this situation, I pay her 80 bucks a week to be able to call her whenever i have issues. In theory, couldn't I just find a real sponsor to do the same thing for free?\n\n* I worry that since she's available to talk to 24/7, I tend to lean on her too much instead of working things out on my own. \n\n* she's judgmental, and she puts labels on other people who aren't in support groups. She discourages me from being around them.\n\n* I often tell her about my social skills struggles, and she encourages me to \"be my own best friend\" instead of looking to others. I agree with this a lot, but I also want to learn new skills and make new friends. I don't necessarily want to accept my shyness and tendency to cut off from society. I'm a bit of a hermit and it feels like shit most of the time. I'm also not interested in looking for friends exclusively in support groups, because that puts too much focus on my parents' treatment of me. I think it would be healthier to focus on other things too sometimes, like fun hobbies.\n\n* her husband has called me when she has gone to the hospital with medical issues. i felt really awkward about that and didn't know what to say. she also encourages me to befriend her husband.\n\nThanks for letting me write it out and think things through here.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: \nI went ahead and pulled the plug. I sent a respectful termination letter via email. To protect myself from any drama or fallout, I've temporarily blocked her on my phone, and I've logged out of my personal email on all my devices. I'm on vacation this week (headed to the beach) so I won't miss anything by ignoring emails for a while. Thank you so much to everybody for your validation and support. I had a feeling that things were going south but I didn't know that these red flags were so huge. On to something better and more awesome, where I can truly grow. ",

If I could just never eat again, that would be great.  \n\nThis might be something that isn't related to being an ACoN, but I am not sure and that is why I am posting about it here.  My parents used to force me to eat things that made me sick and that I had real sensitivities to.  I was pretty much always had horrible stomach problems as a child because of this.  I was also forced to eat foods where the texture was so disturbing to me that I would just gag/vomit it up again.  I think I have some PTSD around food and eating and it is really tough to deal with in the day to day.  I also have a history of eating disorders and some of this may be an eating disorder flare up, so I am throwing up a trigger warning for eating disorders just in case.\n\nI hate cooking.  I hate eating what I cook.  I hate food prep.  Meat prep especially freaks me out.  I was vegetarian for 11 years, then I gave birth to a child with nut allergies and my husband is allergic to soy, so I have cut most of the nuts/tofu/other soy out of my diet and went back to eating meat sparinly.  I do eat nuts, but only when my 3 year-old is sleeping, so it is very restricted and I have to be very careful not to leave any peanut crumbs or anything anywhere in the house.  I hate eating meat.  I eat it...but I hate it.  I hate preparing it.  Even years later, I still gag sometimes when prepping it.  I still sometimes gag when eating it.  I have learned not to let myself think about it too much.  I put myself in \"no thinking\" mode and just try to cook or eat.  It doesn't always help, though.  \n\nI am very, very sensitive to textures.  The texture that are least offensive to me are things that aren't great for me usually, though not all the time.  \n\nI often try to challenge myself to eat better and work on overcoming my sensitivities to texture/smell/etc., but it inevitably just leaves me feeling ill and violated and then I end up digging in even deeper into my teeny tiny comfort zone around food.  \n\nIt's been particularly bad for a few weeks now.  I can really only tolerate pizza, yogurt, cheese, apples, cereal, raw fruits, very simple salad, nut bars, minestrone soup, baked salmon (just barely tolerable), crackers and anything sugary.  This has been going on for weeks now... maybe months.  I am so sick of eating the same stuff.  If I try to eat anything else, it is very very difficult.  The more I force it, the more upsetting it is and the more entrenched in this tiny box I get.  I dread getting hungry.  I dread eating.  I look up recipes, buy the ingredients, but even thinking about prepping the food and eating it makes me feel nauseous.  I can however eat things at restaurants.  Getting out of my own home and not having to prep the food myself helps enormously.  At any given restaurant, there may be only 1 or 2 things that look tolerable to me, of course... I am still restricted... but restaurants always feel much easier.  Restaurant eating on a daily basis is pricey, so I try to avoid it.\n\nI am so fucking sick of myself and my problems around food.  I feel like I've tried everything and I'm as stuck as ever.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?  I feel so stuck.  ",

        "text": "I dated exN for roughly the last 3.5 years. When I met him I was instantly attracted to him; he was cheerful, funny, fun to be around and handsome to boot. After knowing him for about 9 months I asked him out and we started dating. For a while everything was fine. Then we got into our second year at university.\n\nThat was when I started to see past the facade. He wasn't funny, he was passive-aggressive. His cheerfulness was just a front for deep, unreasonable anger. One moment he could be perfectly friendly but if someone even seemed to slight him he had a way of cutting people down with remarks that were ambiguous but could be taken as insulting. And that was against people who considered themselves to be his friends.\n\nI'm not really sure if it got worse over time or if I just started noticing it more. At one point he stole furniture from an absent friend to avoid being fined for furniture he lost; when I confronted him about it (I moved my own furniture into the friend's room and took the fine myself) he claimed it had been done as a joke and he had intended on paying the fine himself. On another occasion he bragged about giving two of his friends food poisoning by knowingly giving them expired food because he was annoyed that they didn't bring food of their own to a get-together. Once he wished that a \"bitch\" professor who he viewed as speaking down to him would \"get into a bad accident.\" You see the pattern.\n\nI knew for a while that the relationship wasn't good for me, but I'd trapped myself. We were roommates for all the years that we dated so I couldn't get away even if I wanted to, being thousands of miles from home. I also had low self-esteem during that time and for many years prior, and during our senior year I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and dysthymia. But on some level I thought he'd grow out of it, or maybe I could change him. At any rate I still cared about and trusted him, and that proved to be my undoing.\n\nAs of last summer he still needed to graduate, not having gotten all his credits in (he had the opportunity to but simply decided not to take the necessary course) so he was desperate to pass his final online course in order to get his degree. The big problem was that he was working on a personal project at the same time and he didn't believe he could finish both on time, so I agreed to help him with his coursework. In retrospect the fee I asked for was too high, but he readily agreed to it so we got to work. By the end of it he'd passed with an A and finished his project so it was a resounding success. \nThen came time for my payment.\n\nI was visiting him at a later date when I brought it up. He'd told his mother about what we were doing, but when I brought up payment she was surprised; evidently he hadn't told her that he was supposed to compensate me. I now believe that the only reason I got any money at all (he paid me half then) was because I'd put him on the spot in front of his mother. Why? Because of what he told me after we broke up.\n\n\"I agreed to it so you would do it.\" That he wasn't going to pay the other half of what we'd agreed to was a given.\n\nThis isn't about the money. As I told him, I happily would have accepted far less, but he never even tried to negotiate. He never demonstrated anything less than satisfaction with our agreement until after I'd already done him the service that he needed. Once that was done, and I was breaking up with him for unrelated reasons, it seems I was no longer of use to him so there was no downside to him telling me exactly how it was. \n\nHonesty was never a priority. My thoughts and feelings on the matter as his S.O. never even entered the equation. As far as he was concerned the biggest risk was not getting what he wanted, so he'd say whatever he needed to in order to obtain that. Once he was done using me then that was the end of it. I've been crushed ever since, and he's living his life as before. \n\nThe part that horrifies me is that I look back on our relationship and I have no way of knowing what was true and what wasn't. The feelings of paranoia that I got around him, that he was somehow manipulating me and that I dismissed due to my mental illness, were those my instincts trying to warn me? He told me he loved me; did he ever, or was that a front too? It's like I was insane when I was with him, and now that I'm not I don't know what's real anymore. \nAt this point the only constant is pain.",

        "text": "TLDR: Turns out the problem isn't my anxiety and PTSD, the problem is that my boss is a bully. She tried to take me down in a 'solutions' meeting, but I owned her ass. Now I know the truth, I'm looking for a better job with non-toxic management. \n\nThanks so much everyone who contributed to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/446x62/dr_advised_me_to_tell_colleagues_about_my_anxiety/).\n\nI didn't write back to everyone, I was in a rough place. But I appreciated all your comments immensely, thank you so much. I just wanted to write an update, sorry it's long, wanted to get it all out.  \n\nFirstly, thanks so much to the person who pointed out my boss is a bully. I didn't want to believe it at first - she's always *seemed* to be so nice to me. And then I looked carefully at her actions and not her words. And yup, my boss has been bullying me for months, under cover of a saccharine smile, condescending looks of concern, and a martyr complex (she's a divorced single Mom, poor her, and she goes on 4 ski trips every year, works just half the week and owns her own home - such a hard life, poor little lamb.)\n\nThe head of our team \"Jane\" called a meeting between me, my boss \"Claire\" and another colleague \"Margaret\" we work closely with, to talk about 'solutions to the problems I've been having' (not their real names of course).  I didn't want to have this meeting, but Jane reassured me she would 'lay the foundations' with Claire ahead of the meeting, so that the meeting could be constructive and solutions-focused. And so I agreed, provided I could have someone with me. The union rep, who happens to be a friend, kindly agreed to come to the meeting with me - she took notes throughout, she was amazing.  \n\nThe meeting was brutal. \n\nBut it clarified for me that my boss is 100% definitely a bully. She doesn't care about me at all, she says lots of sweet, caring things, but treats me like sh*t. \n\nJane invited me to share some of the solutions I'd thought of for improving our 'communication difficulties'. I explained I'd made some notes, and I could talk about some of the difficulties I'd been having and then my suggestions for solutions. Jane agreed that I do that. So, I started out explaining that often I don't get all the information that I need to complete a piece of work... and straight away Claire interrupted me saying \"could you give us an example of when this has happened?\"  \n\nSo I gave an example. And she tried to tear it apart. She went for me like an attack dog. (Wasn't this supposed to be about solutions!?) Coming up with anything she could think of to make me look stupid, and like I was in the wrong, and making a fuss of nothing  ...  I should have read the brief fully, I don't talk to her often enough, well she wouldn't have done it that way herself, she doesn't want to do my work for me... etc. She kept trying everything she could think of to make me angry, to get a reaction.\n\nSilly woman. What she didn't know is that I'm RBN. I've heard all those BS invalidations a million times before. And I knew exactly what to do.  I stayed very, very calm. I kept my voice level, calm and assertive.  I didn't rise to her stupid jibes. I calmly, analytically, logically destroyed every BS invalidation she could think of. \n\n* Me: \"You asked me to describe \"other factors\" in the report. I didn't know what you meant and I asked for an explanation. You told me 'say something about the over-arching campaign that was running' - but I didn't have any information about that.\"\n* Claire: You could have just asked me about that. \n* Me: I asked you, but I didn't get an answer. \n* Claire: Well, I don't want to have to write the report for you.  \n* Me: *watching her in silence* (I knew better than to dignify this undermining dig with a response)\n* Claire: Anyway, I'd have just written 'other factors' in the report if I were you.\n* Me: But I can't know what you would do in my place, when I don't have the same information that you have.\n* Claire: *Stunned silence. Face of fury.*  \n\nAnd so it went on, her asking for examples of the problems I'd had and then trying everything she could think of to minimise and disregard my concerns, and even pretend to be concerned for me! I stayed very calm, I responded calmly, I maintained my professionalism. I didn't rise to her subtle digs or jibes. By the end of the meeting she was sitting in silent fury. She looked completely shocked - I think she had a very clear idea of how the meeting was going to go her way. How she was going to make me look foolish and incompetent. And she failed miserably to do that. I owned her.   \n\nSome 'solutions' were reluctantly agreed, with much resistance on her part. But zero acknowledgement that there was anything wrong with her behaviour. She seems to think that constantly interrupting me, ignoring everything I say, never giving me a straight answer, excluding me from project meetings, and not giving me important information are acceptable behaviours for a manager. \n\nSo, yeah, the meeting was brutal. Claire went straight home afterwards - 1.5 hours before the end of the day. She called in sick the next day, and then she was on annual leave. So I haven't seen her since the meeting. \n\nThe head of our team, Jane, is not acknowledging to me that anything was wrong with Claire's behaviour in that meeting. Jane said to me that \"You didn't say what I expected you to say in that meeting. But I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't do anything wrong.\" I've no idea what that means really. I guess she didn't expect me to actually be honest. Or she didn't expect me to stand up for myself? Jane is usually a pretty brilliant manager, so I'm a bit confused by this - she's probably not telling me waht she really thinks?  My hunch is that Jane is just trying to keep the team going at a very busy time. (Believe it or not, I'm actually managing to get some work done around this silly drama). \n\nI hated the meeting. Having every tiny little flaw attacked by my Line Manager was, unsurprisingly, very triggering. But I made it through, and although (still) very scared, I feel immensely proud of myself for standing my ground. Somehow it was like... you know often on the bus home after an argument or something, you think of the perfect thing to say. Somehow I managed to think of the perfect thing to say, right then and there. It felt amazingly satisfying. But I was just being honest. I wasn't attacking or hurting anyone.  \n\nThe fact that she went for me in the meeting, with zero compassion whatsoever, has clarified for me that she is in fact a bully.  And this realisation has pulled me out of the anxiety and self-loathing I was struggling with. I got angry. I decided that I WILL NOT LET THIS BITCH RUIN MY LIFE. I started running again. I made it out on 4 runs this week, and did one yoga session. They weren't punishing myself with rage sort of runs. They were more like - I'm going to use this anger as energy to get me moving again, I'm going to be kind and care for myself, and run as much as makes me happy.   \n\nAnd our colleague, Margaret, has been incredibly nice to me all week, while Claire has been on vacation. I thought it was fake at first. But now I'm wondering if she's been having similar problems with Claire, and sees me as an ally and was glad that I spoke out.  \n\nRegardless of all that, I'm looking for a new job now. I have a rule about not having negativity and toxic people in my life. So I'm moving on, just as soon as I find a new job that I like the look of and seems like a good move. (I'm NOT going to jump out of the frying pan into the fire.) \n\nI feel scared about work next week - Claire will be back from holiday. And there will be a report from Occupational Health in her inbox explaining that I need to do a Stress Risk Assessment form and I don't know what else. I'm planning on just getting my head down, saying as little as possible, and cultivating all the other good relationships I have at work, and the working relationship with Margaret too. But I'm still feeling pretty scared.\n\nBut SO says he feels sorry for Claire. I asked why. He said, \"because you're so much smarter than she is.\" \n\nThat was reassuring to hear. But I'm not interested in playing games. I'm interested in moving to a better job. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far!  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

        "text": "To heal little wounds and life long perceptions:\n\n- I allow myself breakfast. Where I sit down, and take my time. Because no one ever thanks you for rushing in to work and being hangry until lunch, even if it does allow you to tell martyric stories about how hard you work. No. My work place will have to judge me on the quality of my work, not whether I'm there at 8.45 (as I sometimes am), 9 or 9.15 (as I also sometimes am).\n\n- I buy myself the good shoes, a nice shirt, a proper coat. I still have gleeful itches to buy tonnes of £3 quid basic shirts in Primark because that makes me frugal and not wasteful: even if they don't fit me right. But, I take my time. I carefully select a new garment to buy - and I buy for comfort and longevity.\n\n- I don't fuss about the number on the label. I have a vivid memory of shouting \"Mom, look, I am only in a size 14!\" and her replying \"so what? Won't be long until your back up above that anyway\". And, yes, I am now in size 20. And I like my body. I look damn good in a short skirt. I can lift almost my own body weight in deadlifts. And I am proportionate and healthy. The number on the tag is just a helpful number - it lets me not have to try and get a teeny dress back over my head after my bosom denied it access to the rest of my body. It is not a sign of life failure.\n\n- I cook with fresh vegetables. And I cook for taste and nutrition, not just whatever was on sale and what will give the biggest sense of feeling full for the least money.\n\n- I treat my skin and hair. Not because I want others to find me attractive, but because I like the feeling of my skin being moistened and not painfully dry. And the feeling of bouncy hair. So I buy myself products that suit me and my sensitive skin: and avoid bulk buying whatever I see in order to have an arsenal of unused creams.\n\n- I allow myself to feel and to talk about my feelings. I remember that my feelings are valid. And I find people that will listen and respond, even challenge me. So that I can heal and grow\n\n- I do things because I want to, not because I should. I craft, and read, and go to movies. And if I don't want to go to something, even on the day, I let others know that I don't feel like it and go home. No bad excuses, no sudden emergencies, no double booking because I'm so popular. And definitely no going there because I should and then being a sourpuss.\n\n\nThese are some of my daily efforts to give myself nurture. To love myself and live for me. To teach myself healthy behaviour on many different accounts.\n\nWhat are yours?",

        "text": "I went from RBN straight to a first marriage when I was 18 with an emotionally abusing N that lasted 9 years. This year, I celebrated 8 years NC with my entire FOO and my ex-spouse. I've been in therapy almost the entire 8 years, and have learned so very much. Things are so much better, and I have been in a caring and mutually supportive relationship for the last 4 1/2 years, and we're planning to get married this June. \"Mike\" is great, and always wants me to be comfortable and happy. He has attended therapy with me and understands the RBN issues really well.\n\nLast New Years Eve (2014/2015), we went to New York City and met up with some of his friends and some of our mutual friends for a big holiday weekend together. At the midnight countdown he was gone. Around 1 am he came back and told me sorry, that he was outside taking a walk with his friend \"Selma\" - she was going through a hard time and they were catching up and he was helping her deal with \"issue X\" - something so personal she would probably not want me to know. He did tell me the issue, but said she would feel weird if I were involved, so she is apparently unaware that I know what it is.\n\nI was mildly miffed that he left me at a party and during NYE at midnight, but when I heard that his friend needed him it made it all better for me. Helping friends is one of the things I like best about him.\n\nMike went on a camping trip this summer with the same group of friends, but I couldn't go due to work. She was present, but so were a lot of other people. He mentioned her, but mostly in the context that \"issue X\" was better but not completely resolved. Mind you, this information came from him while we were catching up after he got home from camping so I assumed he had gotten the update from her after seeing her in person on this trip.\n\nSo things haven't been good lately, and I didn't know why - it just seemed like there was some distance between us. I thought maybe I was being less interesting or nice or something and I had at least a couple of my therapy sessions about how I can be a better partner without also assuming all of the emotional work (one of my FLEAS - I do all the emotional work in relationships, historically, and I'm working to change that).\n\nI've also talked to him about why he just hadn't seemed as interested in telling me about his day and hearing about mine, which has been one of our habits after dinner or before bed. He's claimed that there just isn't much interesting going on, and that we're both so busy that we are tired at night. \n\na) those two things are in conflict with each other and I did point it out once and b) he always seems tired now - even though the holiday crunch time (post-holiday sales accounting for retail stores) at his job ended over a month ago, he's claimed he's still \"catching up\" on sleep and energy. He does always seem tired, and I've tried making him some nice dinners and giving him some shoulder rubs, and generally just trusting that he will feel better soon. Inside, I've been trying to push away the feeling that he's just tired of me or that there was something else going on. A long time ago, when he came to therapy with me a bit, we established a communication agreement to not think we can mind-read, that we both need to be adults and say when something is wrong and also to believe the other when they say nothing/something is. So this is the thing I've been working on inside of me for a few weeks - allowing the words he says to be what I believe and not trying to mind-read or worry that it's something else or more. \n\nHe normally uses Facebook on his phone, not usually the shared computer (we have one laptop we share at home). \n\nBut last Wednesday he left himself signed into his Facebook, and even though I knew it was wrong, I saw his FB messages with \"Selma\". They could fill a large book. They talked almost every day for the past month, and at least weekly for the past 13 months. Sometimes late at night, and sometimes during the work day, but never during weekends or evenings, when Mike and I are typically together. \n\nIt took me hours and hours to read a year's worth of FB messages. I HAD NO IDEA THEY TALKED OUTSIDE OF THE \"FRIENDS\" TRIPS. He mentioned some of his other friends to me every time they talked, but has literally never said \"I talked to Selma today and...\"\n\nThere wasn't anything sexual or romantic there, and after I confronted him he assured me over and over that it \"wasn't like that\". So it's not about cheating, per se. And even though she told him not to tell me about \"issue X\", he did (and swore me to secrecy too), so I thought he trusted me.\n\nThis started a horrible fight. Making matters extremely worse, he thinks that since it's a friendship and not cheating that I shouldn't be this mad. He's also absolutely mad at me for reading his FB messages. \n\nApparently after last NYE, he became her sole confidant on \"issue X\". But I started to see in their conversations that she was using it to keep him talking to her. If he ever told her he was busy, or if he spent a few days without returning one of her messages, her next contact was always \"OMG ISSUE X MIGHT BE HAPPENING AGAIN!\". And he always responded immediately to that, often leading into the habit of just checking in every few days after an \"issue flare-up\" that included more \"how are you?\" \"good, how are you?\" \"anything interesting today?\" just simple conversation. \n\nI am mad at him, because I feel like the more they talked, the less he needed to or wanted me as his primary conversation partner. Even thought it's stupid, I'm even jealous that there are even mundane things about his co-workers or lunches he told her, that he did not tell me. Not important stuff, but the sort of daily conversation I tend to think of as intimate partner banter. I tried to point out that if you mapped out interactions and energy spent on a relationship that you could graph out over time that the more time and energy he spent on her, the less of his interaction or good time that I got. He vehemently denies that.\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nSo here's where I need LAN's help:\n\n1. He says that he only hid the deepness of their friendship from me because of my history of \"hypervigilance\". Even though I've never ever been the jealous type and have literally never been jealous in a relationship in my life, he felt that this would trigger me to jealousy since she is female. How do I tell if he has a point? \n\nThere certainly are situations I can think of where I expected the worst, and then the worst didn't happen and I felt better after. He knows about this, but he also knows that it's never come out in relationship jealousy before, ever (even when my Nex was actually cheating on me, I believed him and wasn't jealous). Even though I have been diagnosed with CPTSD, it's so much better now. And I've never been diagnosed with anxiety or OCD or anything, but it feels like he's talking as if I were that fragile, emotionally.\n\n2. I told him that after I read her messages (yes, an entire year worth of weekly/daily chats), I felt that he was being manipulated. It's sort of cartoon-obvious that she uses him to vent and complain and hand-wring. And when he is too busy for her, she makes an emergency surrounding this \"issue\" that never seems to resolve. She's never once, in a year's worth of conversation, asked him how I am, or how he is doing in general, or anything personal about him. \n\nDuring one of our arguments the other day he was like \"yes, I have a secret best friend, and I will not cut off the relationship because there is nothing romantic here and we are friends and you need to accept it\". But he wouldn't even entertain the thought that she wasn't actually returning friendship. Even the things he mentioned about his co-workers or a story he told her last month about a business lunch he had, she never responded or asked follow-up questions or said anything other than \"huh\" or \"lol\". I know it's not my job to be a caretaker of his wellbeing, but I don't even think she's a very good friend to him, and don't know how he can't see it. Is that even something that matters? \n\n3. When I first found and read the conversations, I admit that I told Mike that Selma sounded manipulative and compared her to my mother. Bad idea - that's like napalm in our relationship. My mother is a manipulative monster, and he has spent years being ever-more horrified with each thing he hears about her. I apologized many times for blurting that out, and feel so so so bad, but that absolutely made him feel like I was just making accusations to hurt him. \n\nBUT... I've had two therapy sessions since this all came out, and both were dominated by the Mike/Selma issue. Through that, I became aware of the word \"Histrionic\". And, when things were calmer, I went to Mike and asked him to look at the lists of [Histrionic traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder), just to see if he was seeing what I was seeing. He says it matches her 100% perfectly. It let us talk about it more in a calmer way.\n\nSo here's the sticking point: I have a bottom-line need not to be connected to or influenced by toxic people. I have changed jobs and hobbies in the past after identifying (with my therapist) some N or BPD sort of personalities, and I find that I'm happier and healthier changing my life to make sure that sort of person isn't in my life - even indirectly or in a small way. Mike knows this, understands this, and he also knows that there have only been two instances of this in the past 5 years (one work-related, one hobby-related). And he has been seemingly supportive of this.\n\nBut now, after reading stuff on HPD for days, he says that although she most certainly is that, it's not as manipulative as NPD/BPD (the hybrid of my Nmom), and he won't cut her out. So he agrees she's cluster B/axis 2, and that she may have manipulated him for 13 months just to get attention from him, since it was \"just for attention\" and \"she has had a hard life\" that it's forgivable and he's got empathy for her. He even said \"I admit, not as hard as yours, but you're doing better than she is right now\". \n\nWhat do I do from here? I can't confide in or ask any friends about this, because at the core of this is Selma's \"issue X\", which is absolutely confidential. Incidentally, HPD has a symptom of not resolving problems because it gets more attention to HAVE the problem and, even though I feel bad having the thought, Mike even pointed out that \"issue X\" could have been solved a long time ago if she did things differently... \n\nWhy is this destroying my relationship? Do you see anything I can do differently? This is tearing me up inside and I'm afraid of losing the only happy relationship I've had. \n\n",

The only thing that really helps is alcohol- and that's a road I don't want to travel on. \n\nMy emotions accumulate over time until I have a break down. I need to learn how to relax. I've tried relaxing activities like journaling, yoga, candles, a walk, a hot shower, etc but I don't think the problem is so much *what* I'm doing, but *how* I'm doing it. Same with having fun. Even if I am playing video games or painting, I am serious and afraid to mess up, hyper aware of everything that is going wrong, everything has to be done perfectly and to my best ability.\n\n*What* do you do to relax and have fun? More importantly *how* do you do it?\n\nTLDR: I am always tense and serious. I can't have fun or relax, even while doing relaxing activities or things I enjoy.

        "text": "My last appointment with my therapist of one year was a couple of hours ago. She is moving to a new office and taking a better position doing what she loves, which is working with kids. She helped me work through the disparity and shock of my abuse and I am a lot better off today than I was when I started. \n\nI find myself feeling numb, like I'm floating in a sea. I feel really alone now, even though I still have my family and boyfriend. I talked to her about the things I don't want anyone else to bear the weight of. She was my outside opinion. She helped me look logically at my problems and helped me find solutions. And now, in the middle of a really scary point in my life, I feel completely alone and unsupported.\n\nI will know in two weeks if another therapist in her office will take me. She specializes in EMDR and it would be my next step in recovery. It will probably be 2-3 months before my sessions with her become regular and I begin to trust her enough to make progress. Until then, I'm stuck relying on the people in my life that I would rather not put this burden on. I have to rely on myself too, which is terrifying. I'm afraid I'll make the wrong decisions. Can I really be trusted to run my own life, especially when I'm still fundamentally broken and flawed? I'm scared.\n\nI'm leaving my job because of all the stress. In addition to losing my therapist, I've been sickly for two months because of stress at work, college, and life. The family I live with are moving into their first owned house and I feel like I'm being crushed under everything. So I'm leaving my job. I have money to take care of myself until I'm back on my feet but I wasn't expecting just how much this would fuck me up. I feel like a failure who can't handle something that most people can. The job is minimum wage, nothing special, but I like feeling valued. It makes me feel worth something. \n\nI know it's a mistake to tie self worth to work but it's my first job. These people believed in me. I do my job well, I take pride in my work. I earn money each month that I can use to enrich my life. I was smart and I saved a good chunk of it, but having to dip into my savings now is crushing. I worked hard for the little independence I had, and now I'll have to go back to relying on my siblings. It wont be for long, I wont let it be, but still. I feel ashamed. \n\nI was originally planning to hand in my notice this week but I realized I still have time and I think I could postpone it to two weeks from now. I don't want to stretch myself too far because of all the activity that's going to lead to the move, but we have around a month and a half. I have time. I need all the money I can save. \n\nI don't know. I think this will all be good for me in the end, but I'm scared. I feel vulnerable again, weak. I'm going through a hard time in my life and I feel completely alone. Again. I just want to be okay. I know I'm getting better, I'm stronger than I was, but I'm not sure it's enough. I'm not sure I'm enough.\n\nI feel like a scared child again and I don't know how to fix it.",

She said it nicely, because she couldn't have the no call, no show, I was the only client who did that and it was starting to be a pattern. I tried to push through how crappy and pathetic that made me feel, because I understand I'm inconveniencing her. \n\nI just can't seem to do anything in my life with consistency, and it makes me spiral down. I can do better for a time, but I keep repeating patterns. It's affecting all areas of my life, and I don't know what to do. There's a part of me that wants to sabotage my life and quit, and I'm constantly trying to fight off that part and keep going. \n\nI don't know what she's going to say, but if she refers me out (stops being my therapist), I don't know how to handle that. It's not like I couldn't find someone else, it's just that things seem to always end this way for me, I have to leave or I get kicked out because I can't be reliable or consistent. I used to think it was just depression, and now I don't know if there's more. \n\nIf this was an isolated incident, I think I could handle it, but it adds up. All the little things I can't seem to do like normal people can, they pile on. I pay my bills on time for months and then I miss one AGAIN and my spouse is upset. I eat well for weeks and then I fall off completely. I work a job really well for years or months and then I just can't go anymore and it falls apart. \n\nI see the pattern, and I can't seem to change the pattern. ",

I've been a lurker off and on on this forum as well as /r/raisedbynarcissists for a while.\n\nAnyway, I've been having problems emotionally coming to terms with the behavior of my Nmom. Full disclosure: she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which she now claims is the result of her relapsing/remitting MS, which me and my siblings aren't sure is even real.\nWhen I was in high school (and before, but it was the worst in high school) she exhibited a lot of N behavior and really exacerbated my clinical depression and essentially made my home life a living hell. But now that I'm in my 20s and have moved away - pretty far away - and I have more control over my life she acts essentially pretty normal. This has taken years and I was NC and then LC for a while, but she hasn't had an episode toward me since I left. I am still LC and I think that's part of the reason she has been so normal toward me.\nBut what I think is so fucked up about this is she still has these episodes toward my sisters (who are not N and are totally normal), especially when she goes and visits them. It makes it even harder to get my mind around because she acts so normal toward me but then I hear horror stories from my sister about her behavior right after my niece was born or right after my other sister had surgery or even when she just came for a normal visit. She kept sneaking my newborn niece bottles because she said my sister wasn't producing enough breastmilk and was going to starve her!\n\nSorry for rambling, but I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience after going LC. Really I just want someone to validate my feelings. I don't really know where to go with our relationship from here.\n\nThanks",

I told her that she disowned me and told me to never come back to the house. She looked at me like I was on drugs. She actually didn't remember, and then kept on asking questions, \"When did that happen?\", \"Is that what you heard?\", \"Me! Say that?\"... I grew frustrated and regretted even bringing it up, but she then tried to spin it if that's what I heard, then she's sorry. Thanks to RBN, I started recording things that summer so I wouldn't be gaslighted in the future, and I let it slip that \"Do you want to hear the recording?\"... she was surprised by that, and kept on asking what I meant. I decided to let it go, as I didn't have the patience nor the energy to do this with her. And, just to say, today was not a reconcilatory experience. I was not at all prepared for how it went. I don't know what I expected, maybe her to admit that she was wrong and not pretend like it didn't happen or a cop out that she maybe said things out of \"anger\" sometimes. She then said how I can \"hold on to such hatred for so long\", and then, \"let God be the judge between the relationship between you and I. If you just behave well then...\" I literally just couldn't believe it. I started laughing in disbelief. I was being short with her and tried to see if what you all advised me would work. Maintaining my boundaries, seeing if she could respect what I wanted. Well, even though, she knew I looked serious, she was confused and didn't. I don't know if she can. I kept on saying that she had to admit responsibility and stop lying to herself, and I won't accept an apology if it's being framed as if I just misheard her. \n  \nWell, someone asked for an update. I went to get most of my things, I will be going there another day to see if I can pick it up. I'm going to go for low, structured contact from now on. Main reasons for this is that I think NMom is sick. She's always been this way. I don't know what I expected or thought would change. She sees herself as a victim, always and people are doing things to spite her. I'm going into LC, because I am concerned about how her health is heading, and I'm sure all that stress for three decades is not treating her well. So, if I can, I will try to alleviate that stress that still protects my sanity, so that she will at least know that I'm doing okay, and that I am making these decisions by myself.",

        "text": "So, long story short. My BPD/Nmom died last March, fairly unexpectedly. Over the last year, my sister decided to get married. Our relationship hasn't been great, and everything that happened after my Nmoms death was bad. We have maintained LC, and on civil terms, but we've never been friends and I doubt we ever will be.\n\nNow, the wedding is a few months away, and things are starting to come together for it. The issue I'm having, is this. When I got married, like 8 years ago, my Nmom and GCsis basically demanded that she be my maid of honor. I didn't really want one, but I relented and said \"whatever\". It meant, for the two of them, that my sister at least got to leech off of all the attention for my wedding, and assured that I didn't get ALL the attention by myself. Now her wedding is coming up, and I asked about the wedding party. She informed (not asked) me that she was only having her best friend, and my two kids in the wedding. Now, let me point out, that I don't really care one way or the other, if I'm in her wedding. Now, what I do care about, is that it's another point in this repeating pattern of me being specifically excluded from things. When my Nmom died, we fought about everything she owned. I could count on my fingers the things I actually asked to have, vs the things I said I would take if she didn't want them. After my mothers death, there were also several occasions where we \"grabbed lunch\" and my aunt paid for everyone but me. Or the fact that every meal brought over by friends and family, they kept for themselves, and didn't let me take any home to my husband or kids. The whole thing just was this \"she's greedy, don't let her have anything\" scenario. I was also excluded from the scattering of her ashes. I was told a few days before the event, and while my sister was offered a place to stay, I was not. It basically meant that i would have to shell out a ton of money, or just not go. So I didn't go.\n\nNow, here's the main part of the issue. I know, I just KNOW, my sister is purposely leaving me out. I know she will insist that my kids be in the wedding, and then along with that, she will \"let\" them stay in her fancy log cabin that she rented, and I will not be surprised if she offers to fly them out to Hawaii after the wedding. I only care because of the example it sets for my kids. I know that everyone involved will not be able to see the subtleties in this. I know that it will just look like me being a brat and not letting the kids take part. My Nmom would do the same thing, where she would guilt trip me because I wouldn't allow her to give my kids things. But the gifts aren't given to make my kids happy. They're given so that they highlight what I'm missing out on. The whole thing just makes me feel sick. It just reminds me why I went NC with my mom in the first place. Already, my Grandmother is calling me about once a week, and freaking out, because I won't commit to letting the kids be in the wedding. No one gets it.

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm 2 1/4 years into my recovery from narcissistic abuse at the hands of my mum. I am NC with all my family apart from my brother and life is getting better. I have my own small business which allows me to work from home whenever I want to. I also have some good friends and a nice girlfriend. I still have depression, but I am learning to live with it.\n\nSo much for a bit of context. I'm writing this post because I have an awkward issue with my flatmate. It relates to narcissism and childhood trauma, topics covered very openly in this community. This post is probably going to be quite incoherent, so sorry about that. \n\nBasically my flatmate and I have a very poor relationship. She moved here around 5 months ago. I threw a housewarming party for her and tried to be welcoming in the first few weeks, eg asking questions about her day/future plans etc. My efforts to build a decent relationship have failed completely. At this point, she only speaks to me to nag me about housework (this is the basis of 80% of our conversations), to discuss problems with the flat (eg Internet problems) or to tell me she is leaving for a few days to see her boyfriend. I don't think she is a narcissist, just very passive-aggressive and immature (she is 18, I wasn't great at that age either). Interestingly, the rest of her family is really nice. \n\nWe have talked about this dynamic, but things are not getting better. I said that I would appreciate if we had more of a friendship, asked about each other's lives and she nagged me less. She said that she'd feel like talking to me more if I cleaned the house better. I have depression (she doesn't know this, because I don't trust her at all) and tidying up is hard for me a lot of the time. Frankly the common areas of the flat aren't that messy either. I am a believer in \"good enough\" hygiene rather than ensuring that everything is perfectly clean all the time. \n\nThis is a hard dynamic for me that is causing me a lot of stress. Firstly, I'm an introvert and want my own space. If I feel stressed in my flat because of the atmosphere here, it's not good for me. Secondly, I work from home (which has generally been amazing for my health), and having her around impacts negatively on that. Thirdly, I sometimes avoid going into the kitchen when she is there because she is so difficult to be around. My current strategy is to ignore her as much as possible, since interacting with her is stressful.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is a dynamic that strongly reminds me of my mum. My mum gave very little to me emotionally and nagged a lot, particularly with regards to housework. I feel trapped here and triggered every time I hear her. \n\nI would move out, but I don't have much money saved up and my business is going through a hard time right now as well (related to my health issues, I am working on my financial issues). Moving out is the long-term solution. I am aware of this and am actively working towards it to the extent that my depression will allow. Does anyone have a short-term solution for me? ",

        "text": "A few months ago my mother sent me an attacking text. I decided to go NC and just be done with it. I was tired and needed a firm mom break. I didn't say anything just ignored it. She sent me another text doing her usual flip and guilt trip which I ignored. She saw on social media that I was on a trip 800 miles away from her (which is closer than my usual 3000 miles) with my partner and texted asking if we could \"pop up and visit her\" which I ignored.\nThen she randomly texted a nice hello and a fairly normal text. I had this idea that I learned from working in social services. Part of my job is rewarding pro social behavior/ignoring anti social behavior  as a way of teaching clients who have a tendency to be explosive or abusive how to have healthy relationships. I realized I had done the ignoring anti social behavior (more out of anxiety of not wanting to deal with it than actual psychosocial rehabilitation angle) so I could reward the pro social behavior. Knowing it could backfire, I texted her within five minutes with a pleasant response. I made myself a rule that the minute she starts any of her N bull shit I'm out.\nSurprisingly, she has remained pleasant. Perhaps this NC for 6 months was a strong enough boundary that she knows she can't treat me that way anymore. Or for now. Only time will tell. ",

        "text": "I just need to vent about a recent therapy experience. I had four sessions with a psychologist (it’s hard to even get an appointment where I live because of waiting lists) and I’m just so disappointed and pissed off. Actually I knew it wouldn’t be a good fit right from the first session because she talked so much, and she seemed a bit patronizing and I didn’t feel like her empathy was real but I hung in there, hoping I was wrong. Plus I really needed to talk to someone. \n\nFirst of all, I’m seeking therapy now to help deal with the anxiety I have with my family of origin with whom I am VLC. My BPD Sis is very unstable now and there’s feelings of guilt related to her and my N parents, among other issues I am trying to work on. There’s a very complicated history there, with sexual and physical abuse, and I told the therapist that it would probably take a few sessions to go through it all and explain it. However, she seemed really eager to talk about working on the anxiety and being ‘in the moment’, which I don’t feel I have problem with as I don’t dissociate now and am not having flashbacks. She even threw a package of tissues at me for me to catch, in order to demonstrate how that would “bring someone back in the moment”, which really rubbed me the wrong way, as she not only threw it once, she threw it 3 times in a row.\n\nAnyway, after four sessions, she still didn’t know about half of the history that I wanted to tell, because I would estimate that she talked for about 40%, maybe more of the sessions, explaining how anxiety gets started (I know this already), treatments for the anxiety (EMDR, hypnosis..which I have absolutely no interest in, I just want to do talk therapy and told her so from the beginning) and giving examples where she was helpful in treating anxiety of other patients, mentioning anecdotes with her grandchild, her dog etc. I was getting annoyed that she was talking so much. \n\nFinally, she told an example of how her son, who is also a psychologist, didn’t know what to do about a case with an adolescent who was dissociating and so he called her, and she gave him the advice about throwing a physical object for the kid to catch, which brought this kid out of his disassociation. And her son joked to her colleagues that the crisis was averted “thanks to Mommy” Every alarm bell went off in my head with that anecdote, I felt like I knew for sure I was dealing with someone with N tendencies. I became really angry and I then told her straight up that I felt like she was triggering me, that she was talking at me, not giving me a chance to talk and she wasn’t listening to me. She seemed a bit taken aback and then said, go ahead and talk and gave me an extra 15 minutes past the hour to talk about my current situation. But I knew right then there was no way I was ever coming back. I don’t care if I have to wait a year to see another therapist. However, I wasn’t brave enough to tell her this directly to her face. But I am calling to cancel the appointment on Monday, and I was planning to just say that I’m looking for another kind of therapy. But a part of me really wants to let her know how bad I found her therapy and how pissed I am that I’ve wasted 4 sessions (my insurance only covers 20 sessions for the year).\n\nHas anyone had any disappointing therapy experiences with a therapist who you suspected was an N? Should I even bother telling her how I felt about her therapy or just let it go?\n\n\nTL/DR: I had 4 sessions with a psychologist who sucked and was possibly an N and am really pissed off and disappointed.",
