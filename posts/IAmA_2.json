The fighting has likely left hundreds of thousands of people dead and displaced almost 16 million from their homes.\n\nBut this war's roots actually go back much further than the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion. I've traveled to Ukraine repeatedly since Putin first sent troops across the border in 2014, in a smaller-scale incursion that helped him illegally seize control of Ukraine's southern Crimean Peninsula. Eight months before Putin launched his ongoing full-scale invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led me through trenches in the east of his country and he [warned clearly of Putin's intentions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-putin-meeting-russia-intentions-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-cbs/).\n\nHis dire predictions have been proven over a year of brutal warfare unlike anything Europe has seen since World War II. We've met the fighters defending Ukraine against a much larger Russian army, and the civilians whose lives have been turned upside down by that fight.\n\nI'm ready to answer your questions about covering the war, how the battle has changed over the last 12 months, and what may come next.",

        "text": "When you face financial hardship, you may see ads that you can consolidate your debt and pay pennies on the dollar. These companies are often called debt relief or debt settlement companies.\n\nThere are many debt relief companies that seemed to be participating in potentially deceitful marketing practices (i.e. sending debt consolidation loan offers for great interest rates to people who could never qualify). So, my co-founder and I decided to start a debt settlement company in 2018 as we thought there was a need for the service that was not being met. We ultimately decided to pivot the company as the marketing costs were too much.\n\nThat said, I have spent a lot of time negotiating debt, understanding the credit and tax implications of debt consolidation programs, and walking through the debt collection lawsuits, so I'd love to answer your questions.\n\nProof (1 and 2): Picture of Me: [https://imgur.com/a/yJ9jLzb](https://imgur.com/a/yJ9jLzb) Picture To Compare: [https://imgur.com/a/9IKjrzd](https://imgur.com/a/9IKjrzd)",
