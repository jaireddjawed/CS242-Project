They charge high dollar for a sitdown experience on a busy highway, and each waiter can expect to serve and bus at least 6 tables per hour. A couple sits down and the bill for the two of them is $40 for two meals with and appetizer. \n\nKim works for a mom-and-pop, owner-operated Chinese and Korean sit down place let's call it Red Wok. Here it is usually very slow. At it's busiest Kim the only full time waitress will serve about 4 tables an hour, usually less. A couple orders two meals and an appetizer and the total comes out to $28.\n\nMy question is, what should they tip to show gratitude for good, equivalent service? \n",

One, that's the \"late driver\"s job, and they're still here.  Two, it's 2 hours before we're closed and there are 4 deliveries on the screen still.  So I say that's the other drivers job and don't do it.  Well, other driver got sent home after he was back and I took the remaining deliveries super late (when I came back from a double right after this conversation the top delivery on the screen was at 46min, 11min past the promised time) until I was finally finished around 12:35, we close at midnight.  When I got back thankfully a cook stayed and did my dishes (this is abnormal for this store) but all the trash was still there, so I went and took it out.\n\nThe next day I walk in and my RGM hands me a write up form, for saying I wouldn't do trash the night before.  But it's both not my job AND I did it anyway.  I'm one of the only people even willing to close for this store and just about everyone else walks out when they're scheduled out regardless of what work needs to be done.  So I'm thinking when I'm scheduled to close I'm going to start walking out at 12:15 when I'm scheduled off and see how management likes it.  How soon will I get fired?",

I got sent on a run to an apartment complex that I don't particularly like because it's in a run down part of the neighborhood and the tips are pretty bad, plus sometimes the customers call for remakes hours later in order to get free pizza.\n\nI get there, lock my car just in case, and go up to the door. There are a few people buzzing about, going into their apartments and what not. The customer is nice, actually does give me a little bit of a tip, and all seems well. \n\n When I turn to walk away and get to the edge of the building, a metal bat comes flying at my head and I side step and it comes crashing down at my feet. Out of the corner of my eye I see two thin people (Possibly preteens but honestly, I didn't take the time to investigate because I didn't want to get robbed or maimed) standing nearby and one exclaims to the other \"I missed her. I have bad aim.\" \n\nI booked it to my car and left as quickly as I could back to the store. I told my co-workers about the incident and they laughed it off (it even turned into a gag about throwing bats at each other, which I suspect will stick for a while) but honestly I was kinda scared. Luckily, I'm fine and still have all my money, but seriously, what the hell? Not that I'm complaining about them missing, but why not run up a bit closer and take a swing instead of hurling a bat at someone?\n\nTL;DR someone chunked a bat at my head but had really shitty aim. Obviously not batman.\n",

Nonetheless, I have encountered some interesting people...\n\nDuring one lunch rush, I had a delivery to a place called Road Kill Auto. The place had a chainlink fence around it, all doors open, with plenty of cars and other motor vehicles parked throughout more intricately fenced-in areas. So I'm walking to find the guy who ordered the canadian bacon and pineapple pizza and I pass an open garage where there's a woman (wearing a welder's mask) bent over a WaveRunner, I give a friendly wave and proceed to the open office door. No one. I search around some more and decide to ask the lady if she knows where the Hawaiian-pizza-ordering fellow is. The lady turned out to be a Lola: big fake breasts, frilly blouse, pink nails, lipstick--and totally a man. We find the guy and Lola jokingly departs with, \"I'm Italian, I can tell you if that's good pizza or not.\" \n\nThe most awkward exchange I've had was when a man opened his front door only to let a nice load of drool drip down his chin: I pretend not to notice, he tries to wipe it off with a nonchalant stroke, I leave feeling weird. I had to deliver to him again the next night and he said, \"Oh, I remember you.\" Me, too.\n\nRage-worthy moments: not being tipped by children, teens, and high schools that order 20+ for their home football games.\n\nBest moments: getting wafts of marijuana from inside customers' houses.\n\nThere was this one guy I delivered to 3 times in like two weeks and  every time he mentioned weed. Once, he was counting money out for a tip and he said, \"I need to keep enough so I can buy weed.\" The second time he suggested I stay for a bit and smoke. The third and last time, he told me he missed the other delivery driver hours ago because he was so stoned.",

The things I've seen include:\n\nSexy chick answering door soaking wet in tiny towel\n\n~75yr old boob/nip slip\n\nNasty nasty toenails. Looked like fritos.\n\nRugged looking dude with fingernails painted bright pink.\n\nLady in dark house who would only open the door enough to take the pizza box in ...sideways. Always paid in exact change, always had 5+ plus cars in the driveway/backyard.\n\nMystery person who would not even answer the door, just a note with instructions to leave the pizza on the welcome mat.\n\nOne African American and one Hispanic gentlemen in ski masks punch me in the face.\n\nEdit: I ain't judging any of these people... it's just that some things catch you off guard.\n\nExcept the dudes who jumped me. Fuck those guys.\n\nEdit 2, since so many have asked:\n\nWell it started when my douche bag co-worker took an order from a pay phone. Major no-no.\n\nAnyway we get an order to the 7th floor on an apartment building. I'm walking towards the end of the hall when the door to the stairwell opens up and two dudes in ski masks pop out and proceed to mug me.\n\nNow everybody knows when you get robbed, the safest thing to do is hand over the goodies. And that's probably sound advice. But here's the thing, there were no demands. They just bum rushed me. So running is the next best action, except I've already passed the stair well and I'm trapped in a corner.\n\nFlight is out, so fight is in.\n\nScuffle ensues, one dude grabs the pizza and books it down the steps, and as me and the black dude are doing the man dance, he pulls my hoodie over my head and also runs down the stairs. \n\nId like to say i followed them down thede stairs were i delivered some sweet sweet street justice, but instead, I sat there, stunned, not really sure what the fuck just happened. \n\nDid I really just get jumped for a meat-lovers? Did they really not even ask for cash? \n\nYou coulda just said \"give it to me or I'm going to punch you in the face\". OK. Here ya go. This pizza ain't worth shit to me.\n\nAlso, you forgot your sprite, you stupid fucks.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, sometimes at night you need a flashlight to see adresses clearly. This provides you with legal cause to carry the Maglight that takes D batteries and is capable of dealing some serious damage should it be swung like a club.\n\n...should one be so inclined.",

Both times I was suppossedly on-the-road- for more than 5 minutes before I was able to walk out the door. On a third order, I was very forcefully told to dispatch myself early by the manager (AGM or GM, I think), at which point my order was still in the oven.\n\nThen there is food handling;  apparently no one had ever heard of using tongs to place cooked food; breadsticks and pepperoncinis were placed with bare hands. Even arranging the cooked pizza in the box was done with bare hands.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nMoney is far, far better; I averaged around $3.75 a delivery tonight; 13 deliveries in 5 hours for a total of $50\n\nWe are able to relax. My previous store, sitting around doing nothing for more than a few seconds got you yelled at by the owner. At this store, employees not on delivery were sitting around, talking, etc as long as there was nothing pressing to be done.

When I dropped off the food the customer didn't really acknowledge me or the receipt he was signing as he had a couple children running around inside. The next day he calls back and says we overcharged his card, stating that the $10 tip was supposed to be only $1. Even though he placed the order online and personally entered the tip, the manager refunded the guys card for the difference and made me pay back the $9 to the store.

        "text": "A few months into the job I was promoted to shift runner. I'm a 20 year old guy and this is my first job outside the family businesses. I'm not particularly charismatic and I don't really like many of the drivers (barring two, now) as they tend to not work hard when in-store even though they get above minimum wage. The average age of our drivers is like 30, I'm the youngest by a couple of years. I'm also one of the few local people working as a driver, the majority being foreign (mainly Asian but some Eastern Europeans too)- whether that factors into this is up to yourselves, I'm not going to get caught in the racist trap. \n\nI got put up to this because I can do the most in-store and can work as both driver and in-store at the highest level. I've always had good back-up from a second shift runner but the three previous ones have burned out and moved on to other professions. I get no support from the current one so all delegating is left to me, when it should be a shared effort. \n\nA lot of people do not listen to me. I have to repeat myself a couple of times to get someone to do something and when I come back from delivery, they'll be slacking off in the camera blind spot even if there's work lying out in plain sight to be done. There is no work ethic with these drivers so you have to baby them and then they get annoyed that I act like a dictator. It's stupid, I'm polite in the way I ask people to do things then naturally get blunt when I have to reiterate myself time-and-again. I still do half the work as I'm back from deliveries in less than 10 minutes usually while most others take 20+. \n\nIt was made out to me that I was getting this huge raise, £2 from what I was getting before but then I found out everyone else was increased to 20p less than me at the exact same time. Hardly worth the work I put in compared to other people and the amount of back talk I've had to put up with. I feel somewhat betrayed by it. The place is a disgrace when I don't do the closing tasks myself, the prep work takes hours with other as opposed to a fraction of that when I get a chance to stick my head down, my delivery average is several minutes ahead of the next quickest and 6 ahead of third. I felt like I'd earned that extra hourly pay, but it was moot, a small divide between myself and the people that do half the deliveries and work that I don't even have to do. \n\nThe flip side is, I get more hours there than I would elsewhere because we're open later than most other places but this whole thing is pretty hard hitting, but I really should have just stayed a driver and not take on this extra responsibility. I'd have to pick up the slack either way but maybe I wouldn't be so unhappy if the circumstances were different. \n\nSo that's, that- ever been promoted to soon wish for a demotion/quit because of it? Should I stick with it or jump ship? I've been leaning toward the latter for months and I'm feeling like tonight's the night. ",

My driver side tire blew out! Luckily I was on the block of my last delivery.  Get outside the house and park the car. Guy is waiting by the door and sees me check out the tire. We do the business, gives me a $10 tip, I thank him and I tell him ill be out front for a minute, That i had to change the tire. So i go to work, Get out the jack, tire iron, and the spare.  The Customer comes out and gives me a hand changing this tire in the pouring rain, and I really needed it. I guess he could see the struggle going on. \nSo not only did this awesome customer give me a fat tip but also helped me change a tire in a downpour.  Today I sent him a thank you card with 2 free pizza coupons.  Sometimes our customers are pretty cool.",

I had the pleasure of being the one to deal with these pleasant and wonderful customers.\n\nThe first took place last Wednesday. I arrived to the store and immediately took a call. A delivery. I took his order for 24 wings and a medium pizza. After about 15 minutes he calls and changes to carryout. After 45 minutes from his original order I call him and he says he'd like to cancel his order because he forgot about it. Okay, whatever. Later in the evening he calls the store to place a new order. I wasn't pleased but I didn't mention his previous cancel and went about taking his order.\n\nIt sounds like there's a party at his place when he's placing his order. He says carryout and I continue with the order. I read it back to him and tell him he can pick it up in 15 minutes. He says okay and we hang up. About 45 minutes later he calls and asks where his food is. \n\n\"Sir, you said carry-out.\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Sir, I took your order, quoted you carry-out time and told you it'd be ready for you to pick it up. I'll send it out now if you'd like.\" \"Is it fresh?\" \"Yes\" (as fresh as it can be after sitting in the warmer for 25 minutes). \"What are you going to do for me?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"What are you gonna do for me cause I had to wait this long.\" \"Sir, YOU placed YOUR order for carry out. At no point did I verify your address or quote you a delivery time during your order so what I'LL do for YOU is send you your food with the next driver.\" \"Pffft maaaaaaan okay\" \n\nHe gave the driver exact change and a lot of attitude. The driver said it looked like a drug deal going on. \n\nThe second incident took place Sunday. I got a call about 2 hours into my shift. This involves 3 people's so I'll use M for me, C for customer and CW for Co-worker.\n\nM: \"Carryout or delivery?\"\n\nC: \"Carryout.\"\n\nCW: As I'm typing in her information, he looks at the caller I.D. \"What does she want? She got delivery earlier\"\n\nM: \"What can I get for you?\" \n\nC: \"What's the price on a 2 topping medium, brownie and 2-liter?\"\n\nCW: As I'm typing in an order \"That's exactly what she got last time! Did she say it was undercooked or what?\"\n\nM: I tell him I'm not sure and she just wants a price and he walks off \"The total is $19.xx\"\n\nC: \"Well, why is it that when my daughter ordered and asked for change for a $50 they only gave her $27 back?!? That means your driver took an extra...\" I cut her off\n\nM: \"Did she get it for carryout or delivery?\" \n\nC: \"Delivery\"\n\nM: \"Well that changes the price to $22.xx and our drivers don't carry coin change so the driver gave her the accurate amount of change.\" \n\nC: \"Well, I don't see how!\"\n\nM: \"There's a $3 delivery charge on all orders. That's how it changes.\" \n\nApparently when she ordered she argued with the original driver for a good few minutes over the delivery fee as well. Some people....\n\n",

        "text": "Hello fellow drivers and pizza people, first-time poster here, been reading this sub for about a month now, and it's great. \n\nI've been delivering for a local franchise (20+ stores) in the Mid-Atlantic for about 2 months now, and I'm already familiar with a lot of our regulars. Around 10 tonight, I'm up for the next delivery when we get an order to an address I had delivered to once before, but didn't realize that until I got there. Before I left, an insider who is usually a driver told me that the customer, an older man, would probably ask me to come inside. On my first day, they basically told me that whIle it was company policy to not enter people's residences, i obviously shouldn't make it awkward and decline to come inside if someone asks (which can be nice now that it's getting colder). They also told me to bring change for a 50.\n\nWhen I got there, I saw a man standing behind the screen door, wearing latex gloves - I figured it was the old man's caregiver. He invited me inside, and I realized that it was the man. He limped over to the couch and sat down as we exchanged the usual pleasantries. I gave him the total, and as I counted out his change (like 39 bucks), he saw the 20 I had counted out and said, \"Well, give me that 20 while you count out the rest of the change.\" I obliged, and he put the bill in an envelope.\n\nNow, I'll preface the next part by saying that I'm totally cool with everyone's religion, and I don't usually talk about my own beliefs unless I'm specifically asked. But, his next question caught me off guard. He asked, \"Do you believe in God?\" Honestly, I didn't even think about how my answer might affect his tip until after I left, so everything I said was just me trying to avoid any weirdness and get to my other delivery. Also, I'm an agnostic, bordering on athiest. I answered, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nStill, that got me deeper. \"But do you actively live like you do?\" he asked. After a few seconds, all I could muster up was, \"Well, I try,\" and nervously laugh a bit. He responded with something like, \"It's twice as hard for you, because you're young\" (I'm 23). The next part, however, got genuinely strange. Out of the $39 in change I gave him, he counted out $2 and said, \"Now, what should I do with this?\" I responded, \"Well, sir, it's your change, so whatever you'd like.\" He said something like having extra money is bad, or money is bad, or something, then said, \"Maybe I'll just throw this away.\" I laughed, and I guess it could have been a funny suggestion had he not gone on. He said, \"Could you put this in the trash outside for me?\" and handed me the money. I jokingly respknded, \"Sure.\" As I walked outside, he kept directing me to the trash can by the side of the house, and when I finally sort of moved in that direction he said, \"No, no, don't worry about that.\" Then, I went on my merry way, delivering my other pie, then enjoying some down time at the shop before, unbeknownst to me, we got slammed at midnight.\n\ntl;dr: Delivered to an old man who asked me if I believed in God  (I'm an agnostic), and I told him that I did in order to avoid any awkwardness. Got a $2 tip. Still feel kinda bad.\n\nHas anyone else lied to a customer and genuinely felt bad or guilty about it afterwards?",

Seemed too creepy. Plus after the first 5 blocks of actually doing just that, I felt like he was on to me so I made a left and split : P\n\n",

Our RGM is not scheduled (she has two kids and the father won't be around for the kids) and I'm okay with her reasoning for not being there.  But uhh...not without proper staffing.  Her argument is that since it's a Saturday it won't be nearly as busy as normal weekday Halloween since parents will be home to make their kids food instead of coming home from work and getting pizza to be quick and easy.\n\nFor the manager-side numbers we're looking at a scheduled COL of 19.70% and a $45 labor yield (\"goal\" yield for a week is $37~, generally $40 weekends and $35 weekdays).  We'll have one server, 4 production, 5 drivers and 2 managers for the peak hours.  We have at least two drivers scheduled off that have no good reason to not be, as their plans are just to get drunk, and you can easily work until 6-7pm and then go get drunk, still plenty of time for that.\n\nAnyway, I've made my complaints to my manager about the understaffing, but it's just an \"Oh well!\" response from her, which is...frustrating.\n\nI figure story-wise I'll follow with a comment of my super fun Halloween two years ago...",

In this block, we have three huge towers, a ton of smaller three to four story apartment buildings, and little two story satellite buildings on the outskirts of the three to four story buildings. The towers are locked to non-residents, while the three to four story buildings aren't, though you do access them like a normal apartment building. The two story satellite buildings, however, are different. They are small, with each floor being a whole apartment, and are only accessible through an exterior front door like a house has. They have an exterior staircase to get to the second floor. I live on the second floor of one of these satellite buildings. So, I have an apartment, but don't live in an apartment building, even though most of my complex does. This kind of confuses me when I order Domino's online and it asks me if I live in an apartment, house, or whatever, because I don't know how to describe it, and I feel like it might be taking drivers a while to figure it out.",

I was always punctual, but my boss told me the night before to show up on time the next day because we had an order for 15 pies at the very start of my shift. \n\nI left a few minutes early and it was raining. It was a bit squirrelly on the highway and I wasn't thinking much of it, but then a car in front of me spun out, seemingly out of nowhere. Then my car started to handle *really* bad, and more cars spun out. I called ahead and said I was going to be late.\n\nI didn't realize exactly how bad it was until I parked and got out of the car. The weather conditions were just \"right\" that almost every surface had a 1/4\" layer of ice on it. The stairs, the railings... everything. This had all happened within a matter of minutes on the drive down.\n\nI got inside and my boss was pissed. I couldn't explain much because we were just focused on getting the pies out as quickly as possible. He grabbed a couple bags to help me to the car, made it two steps, slipped and fell on his fat ass. Now I knew I didn't have to do any more explaining.\n\nThe office I was delivering to was literally a mile up the road. Took me 30 minutes to get there. Accidents, fire trucks, detours, the whole bit. The delivery was way late, but I wasn't about to start making excuses to the customer. Only a three dollar tip, but I was just glad to get away without myself or my car being hurt.\n\nBe careful out there.",

After that, I knew my vehicle of [not] choice [but of circumstance] needed to change.\n\nI now know for damn sure that I'll be fine this winter, since I just invested in a Suzuki Sidekick with a lift kit on it (and I'll throw on a cold air intake down the road). Those tough bastards thrive in mountainous and/or snowy terrain, so I'll be damn well set.\n\nHow about the rest of you folks? Do you have a car that does well in the shit, or are you anticipating drastically slower delivery times? Does your car absolutely shine in the winter while the others eat the curb?

        "text": "It was a few Fridays ago, the day before the big homecoming game in my college town. I was working a regular shift for our shop, 9 PM - 5 AM (close at 4.) The day hadn't been the best and tips were lacking somewhat. When I can normally expect a tad over $2.30 a tip I was getting maybe $1.50 on average. While it isn't the biggest difference, it adds up when a shift is around 30-35 orders.\n\nI was poised to be let out before closing since we were doing a surprisingly low amount of business. I decided that I might as well take one last run; it was going to the nicer student housing area, anyway. I go out that way still upset about some stiffs and trying to stay awake at 3:30. I get to the house, they don't answer immediately, and I try calling. No answer.\n\nA girl answers the door, the exact sort of basic sorority girl I expected in this neighborhood. She says her roommate ordered and takes a minute to retrieve her. We exchange our normal pleasantries, I tell her it's $19.XX or however much. Now, for the basic sorority girls in my town, you either get stiffed/low-balled, or they give pretty nice tips. There is no in between.\n\nShe hands me a bill, says keep the rest, and I head back to my car. Feeling it, I realize it's only one bill, probably a $20 that would leave me a nice $0.XX tip. I see that it's actually a crisp $100. I run back to the door, knock again, knowing she made a mistake. Her roommate answers and I ask about it. She says, \"That's what I was asking...\" The girl who bought the pizza assures me she meant to give me it and said \"I know y'all go through a lot and have to work terrible hours.\" I stammered, unsure how to thank her. I almost busted out, \"do you want to sit on my face?\" but used all my self-control to edit that to \"thank you, I love you.\" \n\nMy night had been saved and my tips doubled. The next time I see 103 Example St. pop up, I'll fight every in the store to take it. ",

        "text": "Ok, so at our store it is not common practice to give the cooks part of the tip. They get paid full wage while servers and drivers do not. I got a delivery of 48 pastas and a lot of breadsticks to a hotel for a college sports team. It totaled out at nearly $400. They tipped me $55. Now, it's not normal procedure to share that with the cooks (yes I know it would be nice, but nobody else does it) so I just kept it and went about my business. It was a busy day and we had deliveries down to the wire. I was supposed to be out 1 hour before close, but stayed over an hour late to help. I got home and got these texts from my GM. https://i.imgur.com/zc9Imrv.png\n\nFor the record. I did thank everyone, from the cooks to the server that helped me load up my car. I also voluntarily stayed late to help close.\n\nI'm thinking about telling him off when I see him tomorrow. Letting him know that this is harassment and that I won't stand for it and also that he should get off my back. He doesn't complain to other employees when they get a big tip and don't share it.\n\nEdit: After a good night's sleep and some time to think it over I've decided that this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to go to work tonight like nothing happened. I'm not going to bring it up with my boss or anything. If he decides he wants to talk to me about it I'm going to look him in the eye and say this, \"Okay, I have four things to say about your texts last night. I'm going to say them and then I'm going to go do my job, that is, unless you're going to fire me. First, don't tell me that I didn't say Thank You. I thanked the cooks, I thanked the server that helped me load up my car, I especially thanked the guys who helped us drivers with dishes since we were busy all night. Doubly so since one driver's car broke down mid delivery. No, I didn't thank them with money, but I did thank them. Second, I have worked here for almost three years and this is the first time I have ever heard anything about sharing my tips with the cooks, who by the way make full minimum wage. You have never, not once, said anything to me about sharing a large tip with anyone and quite frankly, I feel singled out because as far as I know you've never asked any of your employees to do so. Third, you said it in you text that there is nothing I can do about it now, so why are we bothering to discuss it? It's in the past and if there is nothing I can do, let it go. Lastly, texting me that late at night, while I'm not on the clock, about something work related is incredibly unprofessional and it borders on harassment. Don't ever do it again.\"\n\nUpdate: I'm going to keep it short because I just got home and I'm tired. So, as much as I wanted to say those things to my boss, I was still angry when I got to work so I figured it would be best not to. He did ask me if I had anything to say about his texts, but I just held my tongue. I'm not the most level headed person when I'm angry. Most of the remainder of my shift went as normal, until I got another text from my boss. He saw this post and had a few things to say about it. I got back to the store, made sure there were no customers around, flipped out a bit, and asked the shift manager for my boss' boss' number. He claimed he didn't have it (lie) and told me to shutup and take the next delivery or go home. I went on the next delivery and my boss called my phone. (The SM more than likely texted him.) We had a conversation when I got back from the delivery.\n\nThe short version of the conversation was that he was angry that he was wrong and took it out on me with the texts. He agreed that it was unprofessional and inappropriate. Also, the cooks apparently didn't hear/notice my appreciation which is also why he was upset. We agreed that we are both adults and that we can put this behind us. So, no. I didn't tell him to eat a bag of dicks, I didn't tell him to go fuck himself, and I didn't up and quit. My boss and I are handling this like adults.",

For example, if the change is $15, I hand the customer a $10 note, and ask if they want another $5.\n\nLet me know some of the methods you guys use to get tips.\n\nEdit: For the record, guys and gals, I live in Australia. Tipping culture is very different here and our job is among the very few that actually get tips. If I do 10 deliveries in one shift, I will probably get tipped for one of them, and sometimes I get nothing at all. Since I started using these methods I've noticed a considerable increase in my chance to get a tip from a customer.

Someone (unfortunately I know who it is) is constantly placing fake online orders to my home for delivery and for cash payment. These orders are usually for weird, nearly inedible pizzas, but don't tend to be in large enough amounts for any of my local pizza places to give me a call to check whether or not I was the one to have placed the order.\n\nI've gotten in contact with the usual places to which the orders are sent (Pizza Hut and Domino's in this case) and done my best to have them call me before any order is filled out to my address, and had some success with Domino's before they just blacklisted my address for delivery entirely. Pizza Hut, on the other hand, would not call me for any of the fake orders before hand, instead sending drivers to my house on a regular basis to go home empty handed.\n\nI feel really terrible about the fact that drivers are spending their own money to get to my place, and kitchen staff are being asked to make these horrible pizzas, just to find that the order was fake to begin with.\n\nI've tried contacting the local store, and I've tried using the contact us page on the website, but so far have had no success.\n\nI was wondering if any of you have any suggestions as to how I might prevent these orders from being delivered to my home?

After a robbery at my store one of the other managers quits and he has to come back to take up the slack. Fast forward several days and a couple of emplyees quitting because of him and he doesn't show up one day. We, as in the kitchen staff, find our he was intentionally keeping the staff late so he could steal from the registers and blame the employees. It tickled me more than it should have that he was fired ",

The young single mother from Reynoldsburg says she recently lost a week's pay because of illness, and the tip helped her out of a financial hole by covering her rent and fees.\n\nThe woman is an assistant manager at a local Domino's Pizza and had stepped in when the usual driver was uncomfortable with making the delivery onstage. Her manager says that driver wasn't upset and was glad for the lady.\n\n[Source] (http://m.whio.com/news/ap/ohio/pizza-deliverer-says-1000-church-tip-helped-avoid-/nn7Y7)\n",

        "text": "Via text, of all things.  Light background to follow:\n\nI worked for a Domino's Pizza as a driver.  My initial plan was to work through last Christmas and New Years as a driver, possibly staying on through the Super Bowl, and then take a promotion to management.  As we all know, working as a driver makes you a lot more money than assistant managing.  However if you have a good lead, sometimes the extra hassle is worth it.\n\nOh God, the lead was terrible.\n\nOn my first day I showed up a bit early for my shift.  It was busy, so I clocked in and jumped on the makeline after asking the GM if she was cool with it.  All I remember was a lot of yelling.  It's the two of us in the store and we're feet apart, yet every order was delivered as a yell.  OK, I figure we're a little busy, understaffed, she's having a bad day.  If only.\n\nThe manager at this place clearly never received training in anything.  Her people were NOT her greatest asset; merely another hassle to her.  She routinely talked down to employees, talked about people behind their backs, and fostered a climate of bitterness and pettiness that I have never experienced before.  There were jokes a plenty at this place when an employee would quit without notice.  \"They must've worked with the GM!\"  This was always said as though it were funny.\n\nSo I tried to do something about it.  I took my issues to the franchisee.  In my earlier years I trained managers for Domino's Pizza; more recently I supervised Little Caesar's stores and trained GMs and GM candidates.  A very close friend works with franchise development for Domino's corporate stores.  What this horn-tooting is meant to show is that I have experience in determining what works and what does not work when it comes to management.  The franchisee's response to the issues?  Oh, that's just her.  She's old school.  Everyone just have to have thicker skin.\n\nIn all my years I had never heard that given as an excuse to anything before.  When multiple individuals request to not work with the GM; when multiple no-call/no-shows are determined to have been a result of the GM's actions; when she is widely referred to as a basket case by her fellow employees, in my experience, it is time for a retrain or a good, long sit-down.\n\nInstead I was fired for not being a team player due to my refusal to put up with any more of her shit.  I was hired at Little Caesar's again within a week managing a location, after the crew there pestered the franchisee to make the call.\n\nI have to say this to those of you looking to get into management:  Your people are your greatest asset.  Use them, don't abuse them.  You are only as good as your least-experienced employee.  It is up to you to see to their success, as they will see to yours.  Show appreciation; don't merely critique.  Positive reinforcement is worth far more than constant preaching on negatives.\n\nAnyway rant/diatribe over.  There is a lot, lot more about that franchise that bears further explanation, but I'm going to end it here.",

We all thought the cheese and toppings looked off, and we each gave it varying scores between 7.8 and 8.6. \n\nThat's when Boss Man kind of laughed at us and said we can't judge a pizza apparently. We pointed out it was pretty much like  Xeroxed copy of a real picture, so black and white wasn't being too kind there. \n\nHe then pulls out a bunch of 20 dollar bills, and says that a pizza from a mystery shop that gets 9.5 or higher nets the MIC a hundred dollar bonus (a perfect score of 10 would get the MIC a thousand smackers). \n\nHe keeps looking between Derek and Tony as he asks us who we think made that pizza. I figure it was Derek, because, well, he didn't become asst. manager by sucking at making pizzas, right? \n\nAfter Tony and I both say Derek, Boss Man hands me the hundred bucks and the paperwork showing our score, who took the order who was MIC, etc. \n\nI about died. I've been there not even three months yet, and only a month as a manager. \n\nThe look on Derek's face was priceless, though. It really rustled his jimmies that I got that bonus. Hell, chances are that he did in fact make that pizza, and I just happened to be in charge according to the computer system at the time. \n\nAll I know is, according to some other folks there, that this was the highest mystery shop we've had in a year or more, and that the previous month's mystery shop happened on the shift Derek was running, and it scored a 9.1, so I can see why it irked him that I got this one. \n\nBut I just really wanted to brag. May not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. And it's just made me strive to be even better, so if I'm MIC again for the next one, I get better shot at the big prize. ",

I thought it was hilarious and just remembered it, so I thought I'd share it with y'all.\n\nSo one night my coworker had to deliver a personal pizza to a customer. We were out of personal boxes, so he had to put the pizza in a box that was the next size up, which was a small. He boxed the pizza, bagged it up and headed to the customer's place.\n\nNow again, this is not my original story so the dialogue is paraphrased, but this was more or less how he described the interaction going down:\n\nCoworker: Hi! Here's your pizza. That will be $X.XX.\n\nCustomer: -*opens box*- *You took a slice of my pizza!*\n\nCoworker: ...what? No, I didn't.\n\nCustomer: Yes you did!! See?? There's a piece missing!!!\n\nCoworker: ...ohh, no ma'am, it just looks like there's some missing because we had to put the pizza in a slightly larger box. If you put the pieces together, you'll see that it makes a full circle.\n\nCustomer: No! There's some missing! I need a new pizza!!\n\nApparently she was very insistent, to the point where my coworker had to go back to the store and made her a new pizza. (Before people rag on my coworker for complying with her ridiculous request, we worked at a corporate store, and unfortunately in these situations we pretty much had to be the customer's bitch. Not much he could have done about it.)\n\nSo he takes pizza #2 back to her house...\n\nCoworker: Hi, here's your new pizza!\n\nCustomer: *-opens box-* ***You took some again!*** *There's still some missing!!*\n\nCoworker: ...um, no, I really didn't... as I tried to explain before, the pizza is in a larger box, so the pieces spread out. Just put them together and you'll see nothing's missing...\n\nAt this point her husband stepped in and calmed the lady down by reassuring her that the pizza guy truly wasn't stealing any of her dinner. I really hope he apologized on behalf of his crazy wife. My coworker also thought she seemed drunk, which would have explained a lot...",

        "text": "I work at a pizza place, but I'm not a driver. I work for a nationwide chain with about 50-ish stores. The store that I work in is the 3rd busiest in the franchise ($150k/month gross), so busy in fact that they hire people who's only job is to answer the phones and fold/sticker boxes. That's me. I get to stand in insanity for 10 hours listening for phones and folding boxes until we physically can't put them anywhere else.  For reference I had only been working there a few weeks when this story happened.\n\nIt's not a bad job, and pays well, but it has it's frustrations. Most of those stem from the phones, or more specifically the customers on the other side of the phone. Now because of how busy my store is, we frequently quote pretty outrageous delivery times. I've quoted 2.5 hour deliveries before, without inflating delivery times at all (IIRC those orders actually took closer to 3 hours). We mean the times we quote and do our damndest to stick to them. Our web orders however, are a pain in the ass. Customers will get a text stating that their order is out for delivery as soon as it's routed. Most of you know that just because an order's routed doesn't mean it's immediately leaving, and just because it's leaving doesn't mean it's immediately going to the customers house. We're so busy (and chronically short-staffed) that drives taking 2 and 3 orders at a time is actually more common than drivers taking single orders.  But most of our customers don't know this, and expect to be the first (and only) stop a driver makes while delivering. They quite frequently call if it takes our driver longer to get to their house than it takes them to drive to our store. Usually it's not a problem, and I tell them to wait a few more minutes and the order will be there soon. They wait, and lo-and-behold, their order arrives right on time. \n\nWell, every rule has an exception. It's a friday night, delivery times are running 1.5 hours, it's late, and I'm nowhere near going home. I'm tired and it's only going to get worse. Cue call from customer, irate because his food's been on the road for 20 minutes. At this point, i'm only about halfway through training (they trained very haphazardly, took me 3 days to be trained on phone and basic register use), and can't look up this guy's order on my own yet. I tell him that I'm new, still learning the computer system, and don't know where his order is, but I'm going to go check with a manager who does. Before I can even place him on hold, he launches into a tirade about how it's my \"goddamn job to know EXACTLY where EVERY order is ALL THE TIME!\". I inform him i'll be placing him on hold, and put him on hold. \n\nThen I go talk to the manager. This manager and I got along really well, and were pretty relaxed around eachother. He also had 20 years foodservice experience at different levels and took no shit from customers. I ask him about the order, and tell him about how this customer was acting (just as a heads-up in case the customer requested a manager). I also ask if knowing info about orders like that really is my job, as I wasn't entirely sure it wasn't. My manager gives me the info I need, and then very explicitly tells me it's not my job, it's his if it's anybody's and we usually just let the computer keep track of that. He also gives me permission to tell that to the customer, and escalate it to him if the customer still wants to berate me.\n\nI get back on the phone. The customer's still there, and fuming that it took more than 15 seconds to look up an order. I give him his estimated delivery time (\"any minute\") and ask if I can do anything else for him. He goes back to his tirade about how I'm \"not doing [my] goddamn job\" and a \"lazy fucking piece of shit\" for not instantly knowing where his order is. I then very calmly inform him that I specifically asked the manager about that, and that it was in fact not my job, but the manager's. I then informed him that I'd made the manager aware of his concerns about my job performance, and that if he'd like to speak to my manager himself he was more than welcome to. Dead silence on the other end. I ask him if there's anything else I can do for him. \n\nCustomer: \"Uhm, no, thank you. \"\n\nMe (in fake-nice foodservice voice): \"Alrighty sir. Thank you and have a GREAT night.\"\n\n*click*\n\nAhhhhh.... sweet vindication.",

        "text": "Hey /r/talesfromthepizzaguy, I am a night shift manager at a local pizza place; I was promoted about two months ago and have worked there for a little over a year. The lovely stars of our story is a brand-new high schooler who is also a lacrosse player (we'll call her A) and another high schooler who is almost universally disliked because her work ethic stinks. We'll call her B. \n\nSo A and B were both working the other night with me. A was the front cashier and B was the drive thru cashier. B's mom came through the drive thru. B added on free breadsticks for her under a promo that she wasn't eligible for, came to the pizza make table, and told us to add another topping. She said she'd charge her for it; she did not. So now she's a liar. Petty, but this is just the start.\n\nB tries to take the order out to her mom but is told to get back to the drive thru; the day manager will take it out. B's mom asks where another $20 in food is (2 more pizzas and a cheese bread). Day manager says it wasn't on the ticket; B's mom comes inside and pays for the cheese bread while loudly complaining about it. She demanded the free breadsticks though; day manager felt it wasn't arguing over so just gave her those. B's mom didn't mention the 2 pizzas again and left. So now B and/or her mom is a thief.\n\nB is constantly on her phone. It's the reason she hates drive thru - her phone has to be in the back and that's all the way on the other side of the store. By this point, the day manager had warned her twice to put her phone away. The second time, she was told to put it away or it would go in the safe until the end of her shift. Day manager passed it onto me so I could follow through if she didn't stop.\n\nOf course she didn't. I caught her the third time barely 15 minutes after the day manager left. The phone went in the safe. B went into a temper tantrum, shooting me nasty looks and angrily doing her work. Fine, whatever. She can be mad. If only it had stopped there...\n\nA was working on her end of night stuff while I was on the pizza make station helping them get caught up so we could do dishes. Next thing I know, A is coming around the back. Her face is completely red and she's crying. I ask her what's going on. B had pushed A out of the way and kept on going unapologetically. A had recently injured her knee playing lacrosse, and the push was significant enough to cause her knee to painfully slip. After ensuring that A was OK and she didn't want to sit down or anything, I went to confront B.\n\nI asked her what's up with her attitude. Her side was that she was carrying pizzas, A backed up and was in her way so she pushed her out of the way. It wasn't very hard and A is overexaggurating everything. Well. This girl had already lied and attempted to steal that night. Hurting another coworker was the last straw. I roared at her to get off my clock and out of my store. She boasts to others that she retorted \"Go f*ck yourself\"; if she did I didn't catch it, I was so angry at her for taking her anger at me out on another person. I retrieved her phone from the safe and thrust it out her while ensuring she clocked out. And I went to the office to inform the day manager and store manager about what had occurred.\n\nB's mom showed up demanding the store owner's personal phone number; B was crying next to her. She declared that her daughter is a hard worker (which is a laugh that was hard to keep a straight face during - the reason her daughter is so disliked is because she's quite lazy, doesn't finish tasks, is unreliable, and is constantly on her phone) and that this is bullsh*t. Lo and behold, the store manager walked in at this point. She took B and her mother outside. A few minutes later, the store manager came back in alone.\n\n...I got in trouble for my reaction. In front of my employees. I was told that while the way I handled it wasn't \"wrong\", she would have handled it differently. That I have to treat the employees like 2 year olds. That because I didn't see the push (even though 2 other coworkers did), I have no idea how light/hard it was. That I should have sent them to opposite sides of the store. And that I do not have the authority to force someone off the clock and go home. She also kept asking repeatedly if I had anything personal against B. I told her I do not; just that her work ethic sucks and I have far more problems from her than any other employee. I yes ma'am'ed my way through the rest of the conversation because I was rattled by the chain of events, but the more I think about it, the more upset I am both that everything happened, and that my manager did not have my back. And that now I know I have no real disciplinary power whatsoever - even in the case of a thieving, lying assailant. I'm just a glorified punching bag for customers who think their pizza is burned.\n\nTL;DR: Employee \"B\" tried to steal $20 in food, lied to my face, pushed another coworker hard enough to pop her knee out of place, cursed me out, and somehow I'm the one in the wrong because I demanded she go home.\n\nI have to work with B tomorrow. It should be interesting.",

        "text": "The mismanagement of my store is now becoming farcical. My manageress is stuck in the middle as chaos unfolds around her.\n\nThe franchise owner placed the last sundries order, and now we have at least six packs of small pizza boxes just taking up space in the shop. The boxes probably outnumber the dough patties we have. The guy has no fucking clue.\n\nOver the last couple of months, a lot of the old-hands have left; university, or another job with better pay and conditions has called them away. As a result, there are only a handful of guys who really know what they are doing. The manageress is leaving as soon as she can find something after Christmas, and so we have two newly appointed assistant managers. I can't take either of them seriously. Aside from the fact we have barely twenty staff on the books for the manageress, two assistant managers, and a head driver to divvy up among themselves, the two ass-mans (ass-men?) are terrible choices for the job.\n\nThe first originally left for a supermarket, only to find he couldn't afford the payments on his brand new car and had to work some shifts in the store every week, only to declare he was leaving the supermarket and coming back to pizza-land.The idiot franchise owner coaxed him back with the promise of being an ass-man in a new store he's got planned, and the guy is essentially being breastfed to get him to a point where he can do this. Only problem is, this guy has no people skills, no common sense, is universally despised by the staff as he never shuts up and is generally quite rude, and has the ability to learn new skills on par to that of a pigeon with a stump-leg. He's the very definition of an idiot.\n\nThe second is a real interesting case. He's still a teenager, and very evidently so. Problem is, he thinks he's seen it all. He is constantly angry and stressed out about really insignificant things. Then when there's something he should legitimately get annoyed at, he's not taken seriously. The other counterproductive element of his persona is deadpan sarcasm. So deadpan, you'd believe he was genuinely telling you off for something until he points out he was in fact, joking. Again, the consequence is *nothing* he disciplines people about is taken seriously.\n\nSuffice to say I hope to add myself to the list of evacuees sooner rather than later.",

        "text": "Ugh...we've known each other and worked together for a long time. We're normally friends, but this is rapidly corroding thanks to her behavior. She wasn't like this as a driver. Since becoming a manager, she's embarked upon a ridiculous power trip. I get it, she's hyper-sensitive about whether or not her authority as a manager is respected and I'm not the most deferential person, but I've worked with a parade of managers and been able to get along with all of them.\n\nThis one...I'm the best driver ever one minute, but the second she decides to be in a bad mood I'm expected to walk on eggshells around her and she's pretty mercurial, possibly suffering from BPD. I've been sent home early after a screaming fit on her part twice in the last three weeks. I'm not the only driver to suffer this at her hands. This time, I screamed back and it didn't go well. Frankly, I'm tired of her shit, to the point that I'm considering taking the (not crippling, but unhelpful) loss in money and switching to dayshift so I don't have to work with her.\n\nMy GM, salaried assistant, and I have an excellent relationship and I've heard muttering that they're tiring of her fucking up the numbers just to satisfy her ego, so I'm probably not going to get in any trouble here and frankly they'll probably be mad at her, but I can't take this crap and unlike her it isn't totally okay the next day when she's gotten over it. Ironically enough, were I to switch to days, it would mean swapping with another driver who she hates because he's subtly sarcastic and doesn't give a fuck. Talk about poetic justice.\n\nEdit: I talked to the GM and salaried assistant this morning, and I'm fine, while today will be interesting concerning how the hourly manager (the one I have trouble with) decides to treat me and whether she'll stand behind her threatened refusal to work with me. They remarked that they've talked to her about this behavior, we discussed the things that I did wrong and the actions that were unacceptable on her part, and they remarked that they're kind of at a loss concerning what to do.",

I've never actually been upset with a customer before this delivery. \n\nI deliver in a small, quiet country-ish town in the Southern USA. Folks are almost always decent tippers and friendly to boot. But, good luck does run out, I suppose...\n\nIt was my last delivery of the night. An easy run, less than five minutes from the store. So, I'm cruising down this poorly lit residential street with zero shoulder and a very steep ditch on either side of the road. I find the house I'm looking for and...no room in the driveway to park. If the people hadn't parked all crazy, this wouldn't have been a problem.\n\nI cannot park on the shoulder because it is nonexistant. I don't want to park in a neighbor's driveway because  that just seems rude. There are no other places to park. I pull into the driveway as much as I can and put my hazard flashers on because it's dark and I don't want my car hit (because it is sticking into the road majorly).  \n\nA few seconds later, a young man comes outside and give a me a \"WTF\" look. I'm getting out of my car, exchange a pleasant greeting, and he realized I'm half in the road. He moves a car so I can just barely squeeze in the driveway. Then he disappears.\n\nAnother lady comes outside. I hand over my clip board with the credit card slip and give my usual friendly chitchat. She's nice, I give her the pizza, get in the car. I notice on the tip line, she's written a huge zero with a slash through it. What...? I don't expect a tip, but that just screams \"rude\" to me. You made sure to let me know I wasn't worth a tip. Okay. \n\nI'm faced with another delimma. I have no way to get out of this driveway. Steep ditch on either side and lawn.  I don't like to back up in someone's grass, but fuck it. I really don't have a choice. So I back up as little as possible on the grass and go on my merry way. \n\nSorry this was so long-winded, but the whole incident just made me stressed, upset, and mad all at once. You know you had food coming. You know there is no shoulder. No place to park. Just...why?",
