        "text": "So, something that I knew was going to eventually happen, happened.  I just found out Nex passed away.\n\nI am feeling every emotion in the spectrum.  \n\nPeople tend to exalt those who pass and it's openly happening, as expected.  Even close family of his who, a couple years ago wouldn't talk to him, are making him out to be the most amazing loving parent, son, brother, in the world.  It's all over social media - so many people are saying wonderful things about his overall character based on the few interactions they've had or completely ignoring his egregious, abusive behavior.  I might need to take a break from Social Media for awhile until it ceases.\n\nTruth be told, I even caught myself exalting him a bit, briefly forgetting about what he did.  \n\nStill, it's very difficult and confusing when people exalt your abuser...it's like all of the volume controls I've managed to turn down over the years have all been put on full blast and I'm hearing narc channel 24x7.  He's awesome, he's positive, he's inspirational, he's funny, he's handsome, he's...\n\na dick.\n\nHe yelled at me until I cried, then gave me a smirk for my tears.  He once proudly told me it made him feel good to go off on me.  He turned my Narc mother against me because I asked him to leave my family alone and they took turn tag teaming me to try to get me to go back to him.  He gave me the silent treatment because I had a migraine and couldn't focus on him.  He tried to sabotage my career.  He tried to turn friends against me...you know the story, and it goes on and on.\n\nThen there's the part where he love-bombed me.  I know that wasn't real.  Thing is, when he died, he took that fake person I fell in love with and in some ways I still love that looked, smelled, and sounded like him, with him...for good.  It's not just no contact.  It's forever.  I'm heart broken all over again. Over 2 years of therapy and in a lot of ways it feels like day 1, though it stings a bit less.\n\nI do, underneath all this emotional crap, feel some tiny bit of relief.  No worrying that he is snooping, spying, or having others check up on me for him.  I can post whatever I want and not worry it will find its way to him. I can remove his phone number from my phone's blocked list...I do feel a tad bit safer tonight.\n\n",

        "text": "I feel so stupid- breaking no contact :(\n\nHi it's 10 years ago this year that I had a pretty spectacular fall out with a girl who turned out to be a pretty toxic friend (I got into rather a lot of trouble, money was involved due to their unreliability and it was a really unpleasant year for me which started my 10 year struggle with anxiety disorder and depression and generally not trusting people). Closure wasn't something I ever got because you really coudldn't have an adult discussion with this person which made the whole situation worse because it meant that it never got resolved. I just got shouted down all the time and gaslighted which meant I had to deal with months of harrassment because of money she owed in rent arrears on a house we rented (I lasted 2 months before moving out and she got thrown out a few months later! I ended up having to go to court to foot her bill and she dissappeared into the sunset).\n\n\nI've always struggled with going no contact on social media with this person and I get super angry with myself about it. Although we have never spoken or messaged sice I have found it difficult to not repeatedly fail and end up checking their facebook page- I suppose part of it was always this nagging doubt that I was wrong about them and that they weren't a narcissist or something (she is very popular and loads of people seem to think she is wonderful). I've gone for months at a time by blocking them but always end up caving in after a while, unblocking them and instantly regretting it. I think part of the issue is that we have some mutual friends and it would be just so much easier if I could at least be around this person but I just can't do it! Never have. I feel like the breaking no contact thing is somehow my vain attempt to see if I could try and be civil with them to make it easier for all concerned. I'm one of thos people who care too much about what others think and worry about the inconvenience I caused over my anger with this person!\n\nAnyway, over the Christmas period, I have no idea how this happened but I accidentally added said narcissist as a friend on facebook. I don't even remember doing it at the time but as soon as I realised I instantly cancelled the request and left it at that (didn't realise she would still get the notification to add even if I cancelled it!). I meant to block them again but decided not to and just didn't go on facebook for a while (after all the fall out was 10 years ago)! Then last night I got a message from her about it. She was basically being overly fake nice by saying she saw my request but then it dissappeared and then she added me back. Like a fool I accepted the friend request! My head was saying it might be for the best and even my partner said it would make it easier, for instance, if we have to go to an event or special occassion where she might be due to having mutual friends. I decided to keep it but just add her to my restricted list.\n\nAfter a few hours though I just did not feel comfortable at all. I didn't really want to be able to see her page knowing what it's like (1000 friends, lots of bragging and false modesty and fishing for compliments) or have anything to do with her. I don't like how this person makes me feel about myself and I've never experienced this about anyone else before. I just get this feeling that they are so toxic! Anyway I then ended up blocking her again within a few hours. Trust me I am never going to unblock her again and feel I've learned my lesson! My head was saying to be friends with her just for convenience, but in my gut and heart I know I should have nothing to do with this person in the slightest. My boyfriend's idea to just not follow her and keep her as a restricted friend just wasn't enough of a boundary for me after all.\n\nNow I feel stupid though for accepting her friend request and then blocking her again within a matter of hours. I haven't slept all night knowing she will work it out and I'm even questioning whether I am behaving like a narcissist now for doing this!?? I always wanted to be the better peson but now I feel like I've sunk and fallen hook line and sinker and feel so childish. I really struggle with doubts about whether the length of time means I should just try to get on with this person or should I go with my heart and really force myself to make no contact work.\n\nPlease help! I just wish I could take a pill and forget this cow ever existed. Life would be so much easier without social media! Any ideas how I can move on from this?\n",

These cats are our children. End of discussion.\n\nWe took Kagura because she was the last one in her litter, and she had a bit of a lazy leg. No one wanted her. We looked into her sweet eyes and knew she was ours.\n\nShe became the leader of the pack, who are about 2 months younger than her. Her disability meant she couldn't scale walls with the others as they got older, but she could take any of them down when running.\n\nShe had the growliest purr (like a truck), which did not match her sweet face, which only made her cooler in my eyes. She would come to me for pats when I lay in bed at night, first wanting her head to be rubbed before snuggling next to me.\n\nShe was my girl, and I got the call just after I got to work this morning. I'm sitting in the roof garden of my building, typing this after scream crying for 10 minutes. My poor DH is still on holiday, so he went around to the neighbours to pick her up, he's on his way to get her cremated now.\n\nMy Ndad hated cats. I can hear him saying \"oh it's just a pet, and a cat on top of it? I told you not to get cats\". Fuck that guy, it's because of him that I only found out last year that I actually really love cats and I have a personality that is well suited to having a cat. \n\nAlready I feel like going to comfort eat, and I feel my old avoidant coping mechanisms trying to kick in. The few times there was a death in the extended FOO, I would be the one not crying, and getting on with arrangements while my Nsisters and Emom would flail around. For this, I was labelled cold and unfeeling. \n\nI'm leaving work now, to wait for DH at home with our other babies. I feel broken.",

The problem is now that her birthday is coming up, I feel guilty for wanting to miss it. Birthdays are really important to her and I honestly do not want to hurt her. Is there a safe way I can go without letting her play her games? My biggest concern is that she won't let me leave. Even if she agrees I can only be there for an hour, when the hour is up she flips out and has even resorted to hiding my things so I physically cannot leave. I feel so stupid for even wanting to go. What advice do you have? I probably sound crazy right now. Is it okay to not quite be ready to cut contact even though I know I should?",

While those around me were supportive of my work, I didn't put my accomplishment up on FB for my other lifting friends to see.  As much as I wanted to, I can't help but flash back to N/Edad always trying to outdo me, claiming how when \"I was in college I lifted so much more\" not only as if it was a competition, but like other comments he has made this was nothing more than another attempt to tear me down and belittle my efforts.\n\nI didn't even tell my wife.\n\n- On the subject of my wife, a combination of my snoring (even after the weight loss), her being an extremely light sleeper, and that I'm up and out the door almost an hour before she's even out of bed have led us to continue maintaining separate bedrooms.  This has been a contentious enough issue that it makes vacationing extremely difficult.  She wants to get one of the adjustable beds so that we can try to start sleeping together again, but I'm afraid it's not going to be enough and we're going to end up with a lot of stress over it.\n\nShould that happen, she will keep the new bed and I'll take one of the old ones.\n\nThis bothered me enough last night that I got practically no sleep.  Not only that, I ended up binging in the kitchen for the better part of half an hour.  Don't even remember everything I ate, but I know there were several bagels with cream cheese, handfuls of crackers, and other various leftovers.\n\nAll the while, N/Edad's voice is going in my head, commenting on how I looked after dropping over 140lbs:  \"You're still fat.\"\n\nAfter that, episode, I don't even want to talk to anyone outside of anything work related.  DW sent a good morning sticker to my phone a couple of hours ago, I haven't even then energy or willpower to look at it and/or answer her.  The shame of my binges and stress from the bed issue and other things, this is one of those times I wish I was back living alone where I could just live my life in blissful silence and ignorance.\n\nI guess as strong as I am physically, on the inside I'm equally weak.

His parents are divorced and he recieves money from both of them (not knowing from each other) plus his grandparents (triple income) because they think he goes to college. \n\nI was used to take care to the people around me because I was used that those people would also take care of me. A +/+ relationship (?). He took big advantage of that.

He lied so much to me...\n\nSomewhere in November I confronted him with his behavior and shit -  hit - the - fan. \"I was the worst friend someone could ever have.\" He started to slander my name, tantrum every time we woud meet, flying monkey everywhere!\n\nBut this is not the point of my post. I went No Contact that christmas and moved to a town 200 miles away. This christmas I was back in town for family visits and I saw him, he looked defeated, he looked like crap. We were in the same room so I we had to say hi to each other. We shook hands and he didnt say a word. We moved on. Later I heard that his drugs (amphetamine, cocaine ect) and alcohol habits fucked up his body. And there was nobody to take care of him. His vocal folds were so damaged from smoking drugs that he needed surgery. He still lost them, this is why he didn't say a word.\n\nThat mouth that would call me BITCH, that mouth that would talk me down, that mouth that would slender me, that mouth that would talk guilt into me, your biggest weapon.

As well, partway through the nightmare maze of various doctors I did see, all my medical records \"mysteriously\" disappeared.\n\n- I have never felt any sort of emotional connection to any of them, going back as far into childhood as I can remember.\n\n- Unlike my brothers, I look nothing like my parents.

She had FLEAS from the beginning but I think/thought she was fundamentally a good person. Nexwife went into postnatal depression and stayed depressed for about 4 years. She only got better when the kid started attending school. Nexwife emerged from her depression as a full blown N.\n\n\nI stayed in the marriage because I was afraid of losing the kid. She stayed for the money. When we met we were equals financially, for a time she was making more than me. I have been lucky to have a very successful professional life, I now make 5 or 6 times more than she does. For a while we were unhappy but stable. Then she dialed up the abusing me, the full catalog from Out Of the Fog. Sleep deprivation was the worst. I couldn't take it anymore and I left.\n\n\nAfter two years of litigation I \"won\", as much as a man can win these things. I have shared custody and I haven't lost all of the money; I had hard evidence that she was lying in her financial statements.\n\n\nThe drama continues, and it will continue forever. I have to constantly fight to keep the status quo as ordered by the judge; nexwife is constantly trying to erode the time I spend with the kid and constantly demanding more money. I have kind of gotten used to it and I don't care anymore. Before I would be stressed and worried, now dealing with lawyers and court every now and then is just routine, like brushing my teeth every morning. Just something I do.\n\n\nNexwife just threw a tantrum in front of the kid, porter, neighbors and assorted bystanders, bypassers and bystampeders. I tried to talk to her to avoid spending more time and money in court but I honestly don't care anymore. After the tantrum I just went home and I was happy. Talked to family and girlfriend on the phone, watched a bit of TV, checked the email, paid the bills, made dinner... I wasn't affected at all, didn't feel stressed or worried. I was just happy.\n\n\nThis is a big change for me; in the past I would have been very stressed, eaten lots of comfort food, then gone to the gym to lift a weight of iron, but mostly to lift a weight of feelings and other coping mechanisms. But not today. I just don't give a shit anymore.\n\nDid I win? Is this how it ends? Am I recovered now? Or is this somehow unhealthy and just another phase?\n\nThank you.",

It was like clockwork. I dont mean to offend anyone, I only had to work with this person, I had no real emotional connection, I cant imagine what its like if you had to live with a husband ,wife or parent like this. This was just a coworker, but left me somewhat messed up.\n\nYou know there's a scene in some movies where the villian corners the rookie cop and tells him exactly how he going to destroy him and get away with murder, or whatever..and after he smugly tells the victim about his plan he says \"It dosent matter if you tell anyone because no one will believe you, Im the Police chief/Mayor/better than you, you're just a rookie, I'll tell people your unstable, a bit unwell.No one will believe you\"\n\nWell I always thought that would never happen in real life, why explain yourself if you thought you were so grand, and to someone you looked down on, it wouldn't happen.Just destroy them, dont explain. \n\nNow I know they get a kick out of watching other peoples fear or shock.Thats why they explain.\n\n It happened to me, in real life. This person who had been messing with me for months cornered me, told me they would run a false narrative against me, and everyone would believe them, I was a bit strange anyway being really quite, they told me they would say I was mentally unwell if I told them they were bullying me.\n\nI didnt even accuse them of this, I ignored all the bullshit they tried on me. I just got on with my work.\n\n It was text book manipulation, I saw it coming 2 months before hand, they were like clockwork everyday in their actions,it's how I knew there had to be a diagnosis or label for this strange behaviour.\n\n I ignored the needling and the attempts to goad me into a reaction, but I forgot they would be turning other people against me. I never confronted them, but they just skipped the part where I confront them and went straight to the \"you're paranoid \" routine. I didnt even accuse them of anything, I didnt take the bait. But they had told the boss I wasnt pulling my weight.Total lies.They were charming and on the inner circle. I had to leave.\n\nI saw it coming a mile off, I didnt take the bait when they tried to illicit a response to make me look bad. and I still got screwed.\n\nTheir whole demeanour when they cornered me was creepy and unnerving, really uncanny valley how they first charged at me like they were going to pyshically assault me,but when I didnt react to that they  then  calmly explained what they were going to do like they were talking to a 4 year old with a fake patronising voice. \n\nNo one would believe if I told them. And if they did they would just assume it was bullying and I should be more assertive or some such bullshit. \n\nIf they saw the look on that persons face or how they calmly threatened me with a smirk they would see that they hired a dangerous person to be around.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I've recently gotten out of another relationship with a narcissist.  Fortunately, this time I ended the relationship before it had a chance to become deeply toxic and abusive.  However, it took months and a couple of those were anxiety-ridden and confusing, laden with self-doubt while I was hovering on the verge of accepting the invalidation she heaped on me.\n\nSo I'm posting this for two reasons:  \n\n1. To share the experience I had and the things I learned from it in case this might help anyone else.\n\n2.  I want to ask others to share their experiences with recognizing new N's as a n-relationship survivor.  Specifics are welcome - did they sneak past your radar?  Do you know why?  Did you catch them before they did damage?  How did you do it?  I'm particularly interested in the context of romantic relationships, but ANY strategies and experiences around identifying N's would elicit this internet stranger's eternal gratitude.\n\nOn to the background:\n\nA little over a year ago I was discarded by my first NEX.  We were together for 5 years.  I didn't recognize the emotional abuse or the narcissist behavioral patterns until after a very extreme discarding.  I didn't understand narcissism but a friend who was there for me told me to read about it.  After becoming aware of NPD, and learning a lot about what it is - and after a period of healing and recovery - I started dating again tentatively and with a focus on only accepting relationships that were healthy and rejecting ones that weren't.\n\nAlmost immediately ended up with another Narc.  The love bombing was less intense, but it was still there.  6 months later, the pattern started to appear - gaslighting, devaluation, invalidation.  Then she lied - and might have cheated, too - so I broke up with her.  She almost immediately began to attempt to hoover me into an unhealthy \"friendship\" where \"nothing needs to change between us\" and she \"still has feelings for me\"... but when I'd try to explain that her motives for seeking that sort of relationship were questionable and her dishonesty left me with a lot of doubts, she'd characterize me as \"insecure,\" and \"irrational,\" and that my doubts were \"all in your head.\"\n\nNarc #2 was in my life for 7 months and I've since gone no-contact with her.  So, I should at least be proud of that, right?  She never moved in, I never supported her financially, no kids, no entanglement.  That's as close to \"winning\" as you can get with a Narcissist, right?\n\nBut I'm not proud. **The reason I'm making this post...  Up until the very moment I went no-contact, I did not suspect her of being yet another narcissist.**  The watershed moment was a phone conversation she requested that I only agreed to have after setting boundaries.  \"I will only consent to a conversation if you agree not to invalidate me\" is what I said to her.  She assured me she had no intention of invalidating me, and then proceeded to abusively invalidate me on the phone for 45 minutes.  I experienced a \"coming out of the fog\" process that was much swifter and simpler than my first time around, where I suddenly recognized all the signs I'd missed.  Immediately after that conversation we went full NC.\n\nThis relationship did not harm me the same way.  I listened to my instincts - and they told me something was wrong - so I did not make myself vulnerable to her in the same way I did my first Npartner.  \n\n**But even though I was consciously aware of NPD, and doing my best to actively pay attention and be on the lookout for NPD patterns, it was my instinctual/gut feelings that tipped me off and my rational faculties missed every single warning sign until she blatantly violated clear boundaries in a pathological way.**\n\n**And I have zero insight into how she slipped under my radar.**  None.  In retrospect I should have seen every sign and recognized it but I didn't and I have no idea why.  This is really upsetting to me.  I feel stupid.  Fool me once.... fool me twice....\n\nSome things I HAVE learned, at least...\n\n*  Both my first NPartner and this newest one approached me first.  I am now facing the reality that something about me must be especially attractive to N's.  I am a high-empathy individual.  Could that be it?  Or is it something else?  Is this something I would be able to address without expensive therapy that I can't afford?\n\n*  NPD may typically result in ultimately the same cluster of behavioral patterns but the strategies narcs use to mask can vary widely enough that you can't always trust your past experiences with N's to guide you identifying them going forward.  \n\n*  I feel like there must be a \"sliding scale\" of NPD severity and less severe NPD might be sneakier.  I thought I was in the clear because we went 6 months without anything like a real fight!  ... but there was dismissal, invalidation, and gaslighting that upset me and tickled my \"spider sense\" without actually setting off my conscious alarm bells.\n\n*  When your gut tells you something isn't right... don't blindly listen, but don't ignore it either.  Use it as a sign you need to carefully investigate this person's behavior in a way that is ethical, legal, and non-invasive.  **This is how I caught her lying.**\n\nI hope this post helps someone else.  If anyone feels like sharing their own experiences as an N-survivor guarding against further N's, your contribution would be greatly appreciated.",

To sum it up, I was a difficult child and there wasn't a good category to put me in.\n\nIn school I was taught that obedience was rewarded and disruptiveness was punished.  Pretty typical things like all criticism from me was bad, trying to argue my point of view was bad, standing up for myself was worse than just taking it.  (Also bullied in school.)\n\nI ran into some people online... there were things that bothered me, I just let it go because it wasn't worth the conflict.  I finally got angry enough to say something, I got yelled at for what they later explained as me doing it wrong rather than the criticism itself.  Things went quiet again after they attacked me over a bad apology, never addressing that I said my buttons were pushed.  (It was kinda a theme that it was my fault that I misunderstood them, my fault that they misunderstood me.)  ((It was also a theme that they would attack me over bad apologies as if I knew how to make a proper one when I had never seen such a complicated ritual in my life... Still attacked me over an apology I got coached on, one where I apologized for treating them the way they treated me.))\n\nAt this point, I was still not clued-in on how I was autistic and that there are nuances to how to do things.\n\nTheir accusations of being passive-aggressive only came when they were really angry about me accusing them of stuff.  Is it anger that I didn't have the courage to say anything more directly sooner?  Or is it tied to how one of them keeps insisting that I'm delusional and that I have a skewed view of reality when I try to tell my side of the story?  I admit that the truth is somewhere in the middle, and there are some facts on my side that shouldn't be dismissed.\n\n",

        "text": "We don't choose our parents and in this case, I was raised my two Ns , Nmom and Nstepmom. My father is a quiet person and worked full time. When I was 6, my parents were divorced and I got to live with my father because my mother would physically beat my father. A year later, my father remarried after only knowing who would be my stepmother for 6 months. My Nstepmom never wanted kids and strong opinions about it, but married anyway because my dad made money(I didn't know this until later). He actually didn't, just good with it. My Nstepmom was always horrible around me. I was 8 and she swore a lot , talked nasty about other people behind their backs which I would pick up and carry that behavior to school. She was also very picky. For example, if there was a spot on the bathroom mirror or a hair on the counter, I would be yelled at or hit. She prided her drill sergeant persona. She also expected perfect grades at school, so at school, I was smart with terrible social skills. \n\nWith my Nmom, I was on joint visitation with her, but my Nstepmom had a court case going to remove me from her totally by brainwashing me into thinking she was the problem and I really did want NC. My Nmom is not exempt from being a problem. Nmom has untreated manic depression and lived with her parents until they died, but when I got older, Nmom persuaded me that she could come live with me once I graduated HS. If I did that, I could have access to a joint bank account under my name with birthday money saved since I was a baby. Since then I went NC with my Nmom and got a lawyer to write a letter to release the funds. I learned when I was older my mother tried to put ammonium in my milk bottle when I was three days old. I am still here 30 years later.\n\nMy Nstepmom's relationship got worse as I got older. She would take me to a hair salon to cut my hair really short when I do something wrong. She would laugh at the salon and laugh when people in public would call me a boy. She became anorexic when I was a teenager and force fed me laxatives once my weight was over 100lbs. We never ate dinner as a family. Once I got home, she would watch TV while I ate something canned that she would set out because I had no say in what to eat. She forced me to go to bed afterwards. When my dad got home, he'd let me sneak out so we could be social in the garage(because Nstepmom went to bed early due to an early job) and I could work on homework. She took away feminine hygiene products when I'd get in trouble because she'd feel entertained if I bled all over myself. I tried hiding toilet paper in my room for that reason and she quickly took it away. 9/10 the things I'd get in trouble for were saying anything, but \"okay\". She had zero interest in my life otherwise. I felt reduced to less than an object. School was merely a safe place since she worked at the elementary school across the street and would make visits to make sure things like my hair and clothes were how she wanted it. \n\nI remember sophomore year during one of the \"visits\", I returned back to class crying. My friend asked why and I made a statement in a few words. She dragged me to the counselor's office. I revealed some things to the counselor, but not everything since I was so wrapped up in my Nstepmom's gaslighting. The counselor called my Nstepmom in for the three of us to talk. The counselor and my Nstepmom got loud and eventually told the counselor that our homelife was non of her business. Nothing was ever reported to CPS. We made too much money for them to ever care. That's one truth that no one talks about is how children who well off, but abused at home.\n\nWhen I got a job at 17, there were more freedoms, but only when I worked. On prom night, I lied that I worked all night. My grandma snuck a dress and I got to go to prom. Problem was, one of the people in our limo was the son of one of my Nstepmom's coworkers. I kind of knew him. He wasn't mean. However, on the way home, my date kissed me on the cheek which was my very first kiss. The next day, the guy in the limo told his mom we were \"sloppily making out\" which was far from the truth, who told my Nstepmom. When we saw each other next, she yelled at me about it, pushed me to the floor and kicked me in the stomach. Luckily my dad was there to stop it. Nstepmom told me to leave. I went to my grandma's and got my stuff the next day when Nstepmom was at work. I only got to see my dad when he was on his lunch at work until they got divorced six years later. \n\nI have college degrees, a good job, a retirement account, no debt, healthy friendships, and ability to save money to travel. My father told me later he got married because of family pressure of Catholic tradition. He had me because of family pressure. I struggle with why I'm even here. What is my purpose? I don't consider myself a survivor because of the daily anxiety I struggle with. I fake confidence and self-esteem when really I have little. I yearn to be a more outgoing boss lady, but feel the walls closing in. How do people cope with post-narcissism to find actual purpose in life?",

        "text": "Once upon a time, I dated a narcissist in college. Of course I didn't know what he was at the time. I don't need to go into details, as I'm sure you can imagine everything that happened. \n\nMy ex absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. It took me almost a decade to escape and rebuild my life.\n\nLast night, I was 10 pages deep on Google searching for something completely unrelated and I guess the stars aligned, because I randomly found an abandoned blog that I recognized as belonging to an old friend I'd shared with my ex. Weird, right?\n\nI haven't seen any of our mutual friends in years. When I left my ex, I also left that entire social group, because they always turned a blind eye to his abuse and never protected me. I knew I wasn't safe until they were out of my life too. I didn't say anything to anyone, I just did it. Nobody reached out to me to see if I was okay, nothing. It made leaving easier in many ways.\n\nSo I find this old blog and discover these old mutual friends shit talking me in the comments. Apparently years ago they thought I was a complete idiot and mocked everything from my hobbies to my career. This was when we were still talking and I thought they were my friends. They were always nice to my face.\n\nYet in their comments, I suddenly heard my ex's voice: arrogant, mean, selfish.\n\nI'm sure it's the time and distance (plus the therapy), but I immediately saw what I never saw years ago: these people were just as toxic as my ex was, only they could hide in public a little better. I was stunned at their venom. I hadn't seen anyone behave this cruelly since middle school, but these were adults.\n\nI felt hurt for 5 minutes, then realized this old blog validated my decision years ago to leave that entire group. I knew those people would continue to let my ex abuse me, and I was right. In fact, when my ex tried hunting me down a few years ago, who were the first people he ran to for information on me? Those old friends. But because I'd cut them off, they couldn't give him anything.\n\n**Anyone who supports your abuser is your enemy.** You need people who are 100% team you. I know the reason I stayed so long was partly because our friends blamed me for being abused, and I believed them.\n\nI wasn't able to escape for good and heal until I cut out all the enablers too. I suggest everyone do the same.",

I know that a great deal of this worry is due to narc conditioning and my mother telling me I always fuck up and she is the only person who can \"save me\". \n\nHas anyone else done this? I am terrified. I am working nonstop toward a goal I am not confident I can accomplish.",

        "text": "I have been NC with my Ndad and Nstepmom going on 6 years now and have no plans to change that. They are horribly manipulative, abusive, bitter and toxic people. Between their 8 combined children, 6 of us have gone NC, that's how awful they are.\n\nI've always known my father had issues with money. When he left our family he left my mom with 2 mortgages and a mountain of credit card debt which she managed to pay off all by herself. My father had a well paying job making 6 figures but he and his wife spent way more than he makes. For years they have never been able to own their own cars or homes, they rented and leased the latest and greatest to give the impression of having money. Their toys, gadgets, and nice things have all been charged to their many credit cards. They've also had hospital bills out the wahzoo because Nstepmom had gastric bypass years ago and refuses to eat properly which has caused a ridiculous amount of hospital visits for her over the years. And through all of this he refused to voluntarily pay child support for us, so his wages had to be garnished. Keeping the money for himself was always his priority. \n\nThey had been living outside Seattle for close to 20 years, but I recently found out through my cousin that they had to move back to Podunk Midwest Town that he has always hated to be near his parents because the money facade has finally met its end. I get calls all the time from collectors looking for him. Apparently he lost his job because of health issues, he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes a couple years ago and has never taken good care of himself as long as I've know him. \n\nMeanwhile, my husband and I live in a city that we love in a very nice home, with no debt except for our mortgage, which will be fully paid off very soon. We are not rich by any means but we have budgeted and saved and spent with intention. My husband has a job that he loves and I am able to stay at home with our son. We have a wonderful circle of friends and are very happy with the life we have built together.\n\nI have forgiven my father but I don't feel sorry for him, his choices have led him to where he is and it sort of feels like justice for the many years of hell he put us through. I have been in therapy trying to work out the issues I have because of him, and I know I still have a ways to go, but I'm finally at peace and the happiest I have ever been.",

That was our agreement, that he would stay home with the kids then get a job when they were both in school. He never did. Well, not until I moved out ten years later. \n\nAnyway, my point is that he had a lllllot of free time on his hands. When he wasn't super busy watching porn while the kids were at school, he was making his art.\n\nGenerally, I'm supportive of anyone making art - whether or not I personally like it. But he was so insufferable about it! He acted in a way I thought was awful and weird and cringy long before I knew what an N was. \n\nHe would take plastic junk and hot glue them to other plastic junk. In his inflated view of himself he insisted on calling them \"found objects\". Much to my dismay, it became his excuse to never throw away anything plastic. Instead of clogging up a landfill he was going to transform it into ART.\n\nThe part I hated the most was what he did with his finished pieces: First of all, each one got a printed paper tag just like in an art museum with a title, a year and the materials used to create it. But of course that wasn't enough. Noooo. \n\nEvery time we hosted a party, he would drag people around to each one and give them long winded explanations about what it meant and how he made it and on and on OMFG. We hosted a lot of parties. At least a dozen a year if not more. Imagine how many times I had to listen to his self important spiel 😣\n\nWe are trying to sell our house, both have our own place and share custody of our two kids. He insisted that all the clutter in that house was mine and the kids, not his. Well, it had to be emptied out to get it ready for sale so I was like \"OK if it's mine I will have this house empty in 2 weeks and all of it will go to charity or the garbage.\" He changed his tune completely and accused me of taking his stuff yada yada yada. \n\nHe took everything in that house and put it in the basement of his apartment building. He has been going through it box by box and keeps giving me \"back\" \"my\" stuff. Except none of it is anything I want. \n\nToday I opened up one of the boxes and noticed it was art made by our kids. That's cool, I'm willing to be the caretaker of that stuff.\n\nTL/DR: Mixed in with a box of our kids' art was one of my Nex's creepiest \"art\" pieces *with the pseudo museum tag attached* (it has clowns and little plastic crying babies, so legit creepy)\n\nGonna crush that sculpture under my boot and maybe film it. It's too plastic-y to burn it, though it would look even creepier than crushing it. Also thought about fireworks...",

My mother is 65 and due to some unforeseen circumstances, I am stuck with her currently. Even though I have matured a lot emotionally in the recent years, I find it hard to separate her emotional needs from what’s normal for her to ask of me. \n\n\nFor example, is it ok for her to depend on me for her ride? For the longest while, I used to get mad because she had no consideration for the fact that I have a life as well. But now I have given up on my wishes and realize that she is incapable of taking care of herself and gives her rides from work 2 times a week. The problem is that I give her rides on Fridays and Sundays at midnight which are 2 days I want to decompress from work and relax. But she just doesn’t seem to get it. Is this ok for her to ask of me? \n\n\nHere’s another example. My brother is a narcissist and he tried to come at me with a knife about a year ago and I had to call the cops on him. But she is still of the opinion that he didn’t do anything wrong and he wasn’t going to kill me or anything even though he is a very violent person all through his life. \n\n\nThis is something that happened few months ago. She was talking about building a house back in her home country and mid-conversation she mentions how I need to contribute 30k as well as my brother needs to contribute 30k. Shouldn’t she be asking me nicely whether or not I will be willing to do something like that rather that dropping such a number and just expecting me to pay for her venture? As much as I care for her and want her well-being, was that normal?\n\n\nEven though I am staying with her, I like to live independent atleast as long as I am here. But for some reason she keeps buying my stuff like slippers, food items, gas for car, shoes etc. I like to do things on my own. Do you think she is doing this because she thinks I am in a bad financial state or because she wants me to be dependent on her? I haven’t mentioned to her about my financial state and I have been paying all my bills , so I don’t find any reason for her to assume this way. I want to cut the cord from her, but it seems like I don’t know where to start. Please help me see the cutting line.\n",

Since I decided to stop volunteering info, it helped make it really clear how little he cares.\n\nI decided not to contact him anymore but I have guilt because I didn’t contact him for the holiday.

Yet, here I am feeling guilty and wondering if maybe I am the lousy friend because I didn’t call him.\n\nI’ve done this with my dad. He is a narcissist too. He walked out of my life and I let him and as hard as it was I didn’t reach out to him. Sometimes I feel bad and wonder if I’m just as bad because I didn’t reach out.\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this struggle when it comes to going no contact? I know that these people are toxic, yet I find myself wondering if I’m the bad one for not reaching out -even though I’m better off without them in my life and they don’t reach out to me.",

I’m really proud of myself because my whole career path had been planned out by my parents since I was a teen, took all the required modules in uni etc - and this is a whole different field that I found my own internship and now my own permanent role. \n\nThis year was a lot of emotional manipulation and hate thrown my way because the whole family couldn’t understand, the phrase that came up often was “what’s wrong with her is...” to my prof at graduation even.. as if I’m not even there.\n\nI also moved out to my own place with my partner who loves me for me and we’ve been tgt for 2+ years still going strong. I’m really happy with where I am because I didn’t let the emotional abuse and it’s resulting fallout from the smear campaign stain me for life. I have scars and (less frequent) recurring dread pangs but because of it, can fully appreciate and am x10 more grateful for the good man/partner I’m with now.\n\nOn a side note, I realised (this year) all the times I saw the N and broke down into ugly crying and wheezing for air, those were motherfucking panic attacks. All this time I thought I was crazy, and I was so embarrassed, but another post here described what panic attacks were so now I know. The flying monkeys were fucked up and so was my head and nervous system. Suffice it to say everyone has been deleted and/or blocked from social media. \n\nTo other survivors reading this, I hope your great/good days are progressing to outnumber your shitty ones.

I've already thanked them enough, but do I return it?

Or maybe reaction from my older brother throwing gifts/getting angry when my parents didn't buy him exactly what he wanted and it ended in screaming/fights. \n\nI don't know what to do now, and I'm shocked. I feel guilty, and don't know what to do now to \"appreciate\" the gifts further (that was the other stage of gift giving - in the months/weeks after, my Mother would hold these gifts over my head and say I didn't appreciate them enough or treat them well enough, so proof that I was ungrateful/spoiled/awful daughter. \n\nI don't know what to do now because I have to go to bed and gifts are sitting there and I don't want to touch them because I feel ashamed. \n\nThank you for reading. \n\n",

Some vicious, some \"urgent\" (local news item are you OK, euthanizing cat, make a dentist appointment), some cute animal pictures. But always, always on holidays sometimes two or three messages. They get maked as \"read\" and skip the inbox but I go check them when I get concerned. Her emails aren't always nice but she also talks about dying so getting them makes me less worried about her. \nShe really likes Christmas, it's kind of her favorite holiday. She sent a lot of messages leading up to it, angry at my dad, asking me over, angry at me, asking me over again, describing her tree, talking about how much she misses her parents.  But I haven't got any email from her today or last night and I'm scared and guilty and sad.\nShe lives alone and can be really reclusive so I sort of count on her relentless emailing so I know she's not dead, because I'm so afraid of her killing herself and having live with that. I need to not give her any ammunition, but I'm so scared and I just really want an email from her no matter what it says so I know she's ok.\n\ntl;dr: title.",

        "text": "It's supposed to be the happiest time of year, isn't it? Surrounded by people you love, opening gifts by the fire, singing songs and drinking eggnog?\n\nWell, I'm sitting on my sofa next to my dog crying my face off.\n\nI left my n-ex boyfriend (like a husband after 18 years together, really) after he refused to get a full-time job (he worked 12 hours a week at a convenience store), help around the house, wouldn't pay his portion of the bills, and thought that pretty much sitting around all day playing video games while I worked 2 jobs to support us with mental health disorders (GAD, severe depression) and mobility issues (sacroillitis, arthritis, fibromyalgia). I would come home to a filthy apartment everyday... I can't count the number of times our cell phones or internet would be cut off because he couldn't pay the little bit of money I asked him to on those while I was paying our entire rent and buying groceries. We have a teenage son together who has autism, who chose to stay living with his dad (he is old enough and I gave him the choice.)\n\nOur first Christmas separated (last year) was civil. I had him and my son and our dog over to my apartment. We had dinner, and my son was overjoyed to open his gifts. I saved all of my wages for over a week to buy him a mid-range laptop, and said it was from both me and his dad, because I didn't want to look like I was one-upping his dad (who was doing online GED stuff and working part-time.) His dad, being the narcissist he is, told our son that he didn't buy it and that it was entirely from me. I asked him why he didn't just let our boy think it was from both of us, and he said he didn't think it was right. \n\nThis Christmas is entirely a different story. \n\nOver the past 6 months, my N-ex has gotten a very well-paying job and finished his schooling. I have shown nothing but support for him while he was accomplishing those things, because I believe that even if you're separated from your child's other parent, you should show them that you can maintain a respectful relationship. But since he has gotten that job, he has become belligerent with me, accusing me of \"running out on him\" and basically taking absolutely NO ownership of the dissolution of our relationship, which had been pre-meditated for years before I reached my breaking point. I recently took a trip for a job consideration in a field I have been dying to get into for years, and he threw it in my face, stating that I don't do enough for my son (I pay the required child support per month based on my income, which is considerably less than his at the time being) and I try to have my son over every other weekend (not every weekend because I can't afford cab fare to and from his place as I bring the dog as well and I don't drive). I asked to borrow $20 from my ex so I could buy antibiotics when I was between pays and he refused to lend it to me because he \"shouldn't have to help\" me, even though I have never NOT paid him back. He never tells me anything about how my son is doing, and since my son is autistic, he's not forthcoming with that information on his own.\n\nAnyways, I got my son about $150 worth of gifts for Christmas this year (which was all I could afford, but I got him nice things with what I had to work with). I am paying off debt consolidation to the tune of about $120 a month due to debt I incurred when I moved out (first and last, furniture, etc). I texted my son a little while ago (he's at my N-ex's parents' house for Christmas, because god forbid I get to have him here on Christmas morning) and asked what he got for Christmas.\n\nThe first thing he tells me? \"A NEW LAPTOP!\".  I'm like, what? I just spent $500 on a laptop last year, and it is in perfect condition. My son didn't NEED A NEW LAPTOP. He also got probably about $1500 worth of gifts from my ex, his parents, and my son's uncle. Didn't even bother to ask me about it, whether I thought it was a good idea or not. If I would have a problem with it or not.\n\nI'm seriously pissed because I worked, as I said, for 10 days straight, saving every penny I had LAST YEAR to buy my son a laptop from both me and his dad. \n\nI honestly have gotten to the point where (as much as I hate to say it) I wish I had never had my son, because then I wouldn't have to ever deal with his father ever again. Never have to talk to him or be bound to him through our child ever again. I absolutely abhor that I have that feeling. But I do. \n\nI am clearly a terrible person, his dad is clearly being spiteful because I \"ran out on him\" and is trying to make my entire existence miserable. Everything comes down to being a pissing contest between us, and it's not right. He is trying to turn my son (who doesn't know better) against me and I'm at my wit's end.\n\nI have severe depression, as I said. I always have a hard time at Christmas, because I have no family other than my son and my ex's family (they were like my own parents for 18 years while we were together, but haven't even said boo to me in 21 months since I left their son). I am sitting on my couch, alone on Christmas. I opened 1 gift which was from my son, which looked like my ex threw in the box without a care. He threw some $20s in the bottom, as if to show me that he's a fucking high-roller now. I gave him a gift card and I hand crocheted him a new warm toque because he always complained that the store bought ones weren't warm enough. \n\nAnd on top of that, I could literally be dying right now, as I went to the doc's in early December and they found a large lump in one of my breasts. When I told my ex, because I thought he should know, his response was \"oh, that sucks.\" I answered \"YEAH IT FUCKING SUCKS THAT THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD COULD DIE.\" He has absolutely no respect for me and I don't know what to do. \n\nSomeone please help me. I'm feeling like absolute garbage and starting to realize why people commit suicide at Christmas time.",

Thanks to some self work I have been doing, this subreddit and God, I have been able to see  clearly through him so as to defend myself from further abuse.\n\nUnfortunately, I currently live with my mother and brother and that's the issue. Because for some reason, my mother keeps asking me about my brother every time I give her a ride or if she comes home from work and she doesn't see him around. I have told her over and over not to ask me about him because first of all I don't know , second -of I don't think it's one of my duties to keep track of his every move. I have explicitly told my mother not to repeatedly ask me about him. She keeps telling me that \"he's your brother\", as if that obliges me to know where he is. He is a grown man and so am I. I am just in a bad circumstance which is why I have to stay with her. \n\n\nSo today, again, she asks me about my brother even though a week hasn't passed since I last told her not to ask me about him because I don't know and I can't see because I bought a room divider recently. But for some reason she asked me about him again and when I responded with \"why are you asking me about him again and again\", she gave me the usual \"well , he's your brother..\" response. \n\nI think she's doing this to get me back into the dysfunctional relationship every time I find some space from it. She reels me back in. Even the other day, I overheard my brother yelling and cursing at someone in the middle of the night and this is the guy who my mother thinks I have obligation to keep track of.

I eventually got on my feet and became self sufficient at 18.\n\nFast forward to now, recently married and trying to assimilate with my wife's family. I get along with them, but the family dynamic is so foreign to me and is very triggering. Her mother seems baffled as to why I won't hug her, though she hasn't communicated anything to me directly. My wife calls her daily and we see her parents often. I want to work through this but it's so difficult and this isn't something easy to explain to new people. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? I would dearly appreciate any advice.",

        "text": "Dear all,\n\nAfter going NC a few weeks ago I knew I'd receive a letter at some point. My dad had asked if it would be OK and out of being overwhelmed I just said yes. He sent my partner a text asking if I could conform that I got them as he wasn't sure if I had still blocked him (I did, it's in spam). It's four letters: one of him to me, one of my mom to me, one of both of them to me, and one to my partner. \n\n\nI promised myself I wouldn't read them and just had a look at what they sent to my partner. It said that they regretted their behaviour when he was there, that it was so hard for them because they had always loved me so much and they wished they could have him as a son-in-law, but that wouldn't be the case now. \n\nI am a little shaky, and even though I knew this was coming, I don't know what to do. I don't want to make up with them, I know why I went NC and I predicted they'd send me a letter right before Christmas (seems very N like, just before the holidays and also via e-mail and texting, so they'd know I'd get it). But still, I always have this small feeling if they needed that push to solve things.\n\nMy partner is reading it through translate. Should I read it?\n\nEDIT: my SO read it and said that my mom’s letter reads like a big N letter. She doesn’t apologize or address any of the things I said in my NC letter about her behavior. She continues to make lists and victimize herself (“I did it wrong, I did it wrong!!”), and says how she always felt we were entangled/attached to each other. She says she wishes she could still talk to me so she can understand what she did to me (apparently written in an accusatory tone). \n\nMy dads letter is nice but very theatrical (“I’m crying as I write this, I’m in your old room, I feel the pain you must’ve felt”). He says he understands now that I went NC, to protect myself from further insecure feelings about myself. That they have always loved me so much and unconditionally. But asks me again to not tell anyone they know about going NC, which includes lying to my grandma why I’m not there for her birthday, Christmas and other events. \nHe closes it off with hundreds of x’es (kisses) and a rhyme. \n\nSO said that all of it is manipulative and to not feel bad for them. That it shows they’ll never change. ",

        "text": "So, this is an old account of mine. I was no contact with my nmom for around 2-3 years and have now been low-contact with her for the past 1-2 years. So, my N influences are low in my life, although people in this subreddit understand that the battle is never really over. It's a journey that you just continue succeeding in every day.   \n  \nWith that being said, I'm going to be doing the holiday season alone this year! And I'm super excited to just watch tv and wind down. At times, I do wish I could do fun things and go out with close friends, but honestly, I'm content being by myself. I'm content with choosing what to do with my time. I'm content with playing card games online. And cooking by myself. And just living and sleeping and **living!** I sometimes find myself smiling because not only am I eating really good and am at ease; the silence truly feels like healing.   \n  \nIt may be hard to understand. But, I've always found shelter and relaxation in silence. This is possibly due to my childhood where there has been a lot of fight/flight responses triggered when I heard the N's voice and the possible punishment that would follow, or when she heard my voice and how I might have done something bad to get in trouble. However, what remained consistent is that silence always meant chaos wasn't happening that instant.    \n  \nEven today, silence does seem a bit of a refuge for me. It effing feels good to be relaxed and unbothered by expectations, or friend quibbles, or what have yous. To just keep myself company and indulge in my wants. IT FEELS GOOD :) So happy holiday season! Enjoy it with your friends and family or yourself. But remember to keep your relationship with you first!!! Because it's the greatest feeling in the world.   \n",

This guy was verbally and emotionally abusive to his girlfriends, would have breakdowns where he would scream and punch himself or any objects and talk about wanting to kill/torture people, sexually assaulted a friend of mine, sexually harassed me and continuously has pursued me and I feel beyond fucking violated at this point. This guy has continuously crossed over my personal boundaries with money and things like that. I stopped all contact with him a month ago, but he has a tight knit group of enablers that include his family and even some of our mutual friends. Words literally can't describe the amount of sheer anger, frustration and hurt that I experience on a daily basis. I feel like everyday i'm fighting this huge emotional war that I can't even win. Some days I start to feel okay, and then it all comes back. I can't stop replaying all the disgusting shit in my head. Part of me wants revenge, but part of me wants to move on.

He is almost 40 and still makes her clean his dishes and cook his food. On top of this, he curses at her and calls her all kinds of names if he doesn’t like something she does. He is also very controlling and my mother I believe at this point has some kind of Stockholm syndrome. \n\nSo, today, I sat her down and had a long conversation about how she has to stand up for her own life and that no one else is responsible for it. She is saying that she is giving my brother an ultimatum until April of 2018. He has told her that he will be buying a house and moving out. She does not want to live with him, and I don’t want her to either since I don’t want to see her getting abused at his hand. \n\nThe problem is that, even though I had that long talk, I still feel like she thinks this is all going to get better without any change at all. Even though she seems to understand what he’s doing is wrong, she seems to be living in this fantasy land where she thinks he’ll one fine morning start transform into some kind of a white knight. I know it’s wishful thinking and I hope my talk has helped her, but why do I still feel like nothing going to change? She doesn’t cook him anymore and also stopped picking up the garbage from his room, and also hid all the plates and replaced it with disposable plates, so she won’t have to clean his dirty plates anymore. I just want her to stand up for herself and kick him out already because all he does is accuse, criticize and abuse her. \n",

New job, physical therapy, school, essays, experiments, car repairs, the list goes on. \n\nA little more than a month ago I started texting someone from an app. We shared our snapchat, and eventually phone numbers. They seemed interesting. I had every intention of meeting them to hang out and grab a coffee, but my life got really really busy. \n\nOne day, they send me a text that they're having a beer. An hour later they say something like \"Why don't you give me attention??\"... *red flag noted*. I let that one slide, due to intoxication. \n\nThen, they changed their number. Instead of saying, \"Hi Praline, it's me XYZ\" they say \"Hey jerk\"..... to which I do not reply and frankly am wondering who the hell would talk to me like that. XYZ alerts me on snapchat, it's them... Oooook. I kinda warn/joke \"I almost ignored you!\"\n\nSo, what do they do a few days later? Try to say hello by calling me a bitch. Like \"Hey Bitch\". I didn't like this at all. I stood up for myself and said \"I'm not into being called derogatory names\" Setting my boundry. I get the fakest apology back \"Ummm. K. Sorry\". No, Sorry I ever gave you my number at all!\n\nI havn't responded, I've blocked the number. I notice their cycle, I see that they get nasty and start name calling if they're not getting the attention they think I should give them. I don't need that bullshit in my life. \n\nStill there's that little voice that goes \"But, but\" and I have to remind myself \"There are no buts!!\" Kind, good, decent people have never called me a bitch or degraded me as a way to greet me. \n\nIt reminds me of a roommate I had. Very gay and flamboyant who upon introducing himself said \"I call everyone bitch, it's not personal\"(he acted like being gay was an \"excuse\", the trouble being, plenty of nice considerate gay men out there). To which I took as him really saying, \"I treat people however I want, I don't care about anyone's feelings.\" Disrespect is not cool and I will not tolerate it. \n\nProgress is possible. It takes time. Know your worth, know your boundaries, sometimes what feels \"harsh\" is just the line you need to draw to live the life you want. \n",

        "text": "The Holidays are the best time of the year... *to make people feel guilty.* \n\nIf you're posting or reading here, you've likely had some problems with people in your life, and more likely than not, the Holiday season does not have the same joy and pleasant excitement that it does for healthy families. \n\nMany of you are probably feeling an implacable sense of urgency, dread, stress and paranoia. Even if you've completely moved on with your own life, cut the toxic people out, removed yourself from the environment, the lasting effects of associating a certain time of the year or event with guilt and abuse and fear will likely last your whole life to some degree or another. Personally, even if I spend my whole Holiday season with my wife's family, who are happy, healthy people who all have great love and festivity for being together, I still find myself looking over my shoulder for any possibility of conflict arising when someone laughs or flinching and expecting everything to fall apart when someone spills a soda. We are conditioned this way and it will stick with us for life.\n\nNarcissists exploit our vulnerability at these times. They know somewhere deep inside that you feel guilty, you feel anxious, and you want to do what you've probably been doing your whole life, and trying your hardest to smooth everything over and make everything feel alright again. A narcissist has learned early on that as they confuse you, lie to you, frustrate you and keep you off-guard and emotionally fragile, that you will do more for them. You will feed them apologies and affection and give more and more of your time, your emotions, your resources and your free-will just so you can make the situation feel stable again.\n\nBecause they have done this to you, they know you are especially vulnerable right now to even small things that will allow them a foothold back in your life so you can get back to feeding them. You were prime food for them once, and they want that nourishment *back*. \n\nSo remind yourself of this unpleasant reality during the Holidays when that unexpected package arrives on your doorstep, that postcard overflowing with love and sentiments of the importance of *family.* Or scariest of all, [The Letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3wlz3t/how_to_deal_with_the_dreaded_letter_what_it/). Do not open The Letter. No matter how guilty you feel about not living up to their expectations for you, no matter how ashamed you feel when your friends ask you why you don't *make amends* with your family, no matter how hard your life is now that you've cut ties the only person or people who you thought could take care of you. Don't open it. Don't accept the gift, even though it will probably be something lavish or wonderful or something you desperately need. Don't keep the postcard. [Don't answer that phone call](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3ip2v4/your_n_isnt_actually_talking_with_you_sequel_to/).\n\nAnd most importantly, **Do not give an inch.** \n\nBecause you want to. They saw to that early on, that you would always want to make them happy. They push, and push and push. They say things that make you lose your mind, and when you feel angry and lash out, then you are suddenly the bad person. Now you have to prove to them that you're the good guy. \"Fine.\" You will say. \"I'll come by for only a half hour.\" Or \"You can come over, but no drinking and you can't stay long.\"\n\nYou feel like you're in control with those conditions. You feel that *this time* will be different, you will show them who's in charge. *You will make everyone happy.*\n\nStop trying to make everyone happy. They will never be happy, even if you were to go crawling back to them, feeding yourself to them. They will never have enough, and they will never care what it's doing to you. They will never abide by your space and rules and will take any of your attempts at maintaining sovereignty as a *challenge*.\n\nSo instead of trying to make *everyone* happy this year. Just try your best to make one person happy. **You**.",

But I often wonder if they meant to hurt me (in a “what can we do today to mess her up?” way) or if my feelings were just less important than them getting whatever they wanted. I go back and forth, and wonder if their attempts at manipulation and lying to me are either the first or second. It might help me give what happened it’s place. \n\nDoes anyone feel similar or can tell me what they think? \nEdit: I guess what I’m trying to figure out is how much you can account intentional harm to them, instead of just the negligence of feelings.

        "text": "I am not yet able to go LC or NC with my family. I was invited to live with them a few months ago, but nmom changed her mind, blamed it on me, and now wants me out. I am not financially stable (my whole reason for living here), so she is offering to pay for some mystery accommodations that I suspect will end up being a hotel. I am supposed to be here another 8 months.\n\nThe last month has been hellish. My step dad does not speak to me. My mother will only speak to me if it's work gossip (we work together), otherwise it's usually silent between us-- which angers her, even though she does not respond when I speak. Last night she was in a sour mood, so I stayed silent while we ran errands. She gradually became angrier, so much so that she was swearing out loud in the store *over nothing*. We were supposed to go on a day trip to visit friends and Xmas shop today, but she left without me. I have no car, and we do not live in a walkable area. There is more, but that's basically her way.\n\nThis all makes me feel like a sack of shit. I wake up in the morning feeling sick and hurt and worried about my future. I am never sure if I should confront her when she hurts me, or if I should just stay silent and let her scurry around like she does. I haven't lived with my mother since I was a teen and forgot how this all felt. I really feel like a child again.",

It’s lonely, we had 25 years of marriage and he has moved on with a new conquest (reason he left) and I do not want the him that i can see now back. I just feel alone and sad.",

        "text": "Hey. I'm really no good at sharing things, but I just need to vent. I had a shitty childhood. My mother was borderline and untreated and my father was an alcoholic rapist. Both of them constantly invalidated everything i voiced and generally raised me to see myself as an overly emotional trainwreck of a lazy person. I have nightmare about some aspects of the abuse almost every night and it has affected nearly every aspect of my life.\n\nRecently i got into a car accident and had a nervous meltdown as a result. I was put on a 24 hour psych hold. I wanted to die i was so afraid. The entire time i had my mother in my head telling me I'm a failure.\n\nI had been taking steps to gain control over my life months before my accident. My mother is dead and i cut contact with my father 3 years ago. I removed all abusive friendships and relationships from my life and am trying to find a medication and therapist that work for me. I am doing absolutely everything in my power to make my life better.\n\nSo what do i do in the mean time? How do i function? How do i get the nightmares to stop? How do i stop being afraid of everything? My shrink appointment isn't until the end of the month. I'm barely hanging on right now.",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n \nFeeling a bit down. My therapist told me today that I have been greiving the loss of my relationship with my parents because of my narc sister. \nMy husband and I recently went NC with my younger sister and had a hard conversation with my parents.\nMy parents seem to be taking my sister's side, and it's not about sides at all, but it feels that way. They completely agreed with her being a narcissist and didn't deny or defend at all. They agreed that she is like this.\n\nShe is in constant \"need of them\", even though she's a grown woman (she's 25), has moved out and is engaged. They always feel obligated to be more involved in her life as her parents. \nAnd well, ever since my sister heard about the NC, she's cranked up the neediness..she's probably filling their heads with how going NC is \"breaking up the family\" and it's in no way her fault...and my parents have been cold and distant ...like having a relationship with me would mean they'd be disloyal to my nsister. \nAnd I'm mad. I'm flipping pregnant over here with my first and their first grandchild. I will need them. As my parents and really as grandparents. But no, they assume I'm fine cuz I'm married and have a house and am stable. My nsister needs them more.\n\nSorry, just a sad rant. I don't know how to greive. I've never had to before.",

        "text": "After a week-long of introspection and contemplation, I think I am ready to move on from my narcissistic family. I grew up watching my narcissistic father degrading and abusing my mother on a daily basis. I still remember that horrible day. Anyway, things got to boiling points when he came after me with a knife and I ran off in 2008. I have had many jobs, but kept getting fired or getting laid off because I lacked the basic tools of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently I live with my mother and brother who are playing the “victim” and “persecutor” roles. I am done with him and my mother who is playing the victim who is absolutely unwilling to take a stand against my brother who is abusing her. I am at a point where things are much clearer now. I see that I cannot fix anyone. I can only give advice and it’s up to them whether they want to take it or not. It took me 35 years to learn it, but better late than never I hope. Thankfully I have an engineering degree. Go figure how I got it while living through all this abominable craziness. \n\n\n\n\n\nEven though I am educationally qualified , I have this deep fear inside me that somehow I will lose my job and I will end up being dependent on my brother or my mother. I know it’s an irrational feeling, but it’s a horrible feeling. That’s one of the reasons why I am afraid to attempt to get a job even though I can make close to 6 figure salary if I get a job. I know I can make enough money to pay off my debt and start a new life of my own if I get a new job, but for some weird reason, I am terrified of thinking what would happen if I lose my job or if I have to depend on my mother again. It’s a debilitating fear. How can I overcome this so I can finally breathe again? I don’t even know where it’s coming from, but I know that’s the reason why I am still stuck here with these highly dysfunctional people. I am sick of living with them and want nothing more than a new job and a new life, but this fear is killing me. I hope that makes sense.\n",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I grew up in an extremely narcissistic family to the point where I had to run away in 2008 when my dad came after me with a knife. I have been working on myself ever since. Things were going good until I had to move back in with my mother and brother when my dad passed away in 2014. My brother has been acting very crazy towards me ever since with her extremely controlling and abusive nature. About 2 years ago, he came after me with a knife and I had to call the cops on him. So now he has a record even though he makes 6 figures at his job .To this day no one knows how he treats my mother at home.\n\nI just realized in the past 2 days that I am the rescuer in my family and that my mother is the “victim” and my brother the “persecutor” . I have been reading a lot about this drama triangle and it put a lot of missing pieces of the puzzle in my life, together. I realized how I have been going out of my way to help people at my church, at my work, in my relationships all dating back to as far as I can remember. I can’t believe I have been doing this for this long. It’s such a relief and painful thing to behold since it’s just a “role” I’ve been playing and NOT me. I don’t know who I am.\n\nEven through all this I somehow managed to get a engineering degree with honors. Even though I have a checkered resume, I am glad that I have that degree. But how do I stop acting like a rescuer and start living my life finally? I think this is the final puzzle piece I have been looking for which will change my life forever. Can someone who understands the DDT roles and have worked through it please give me some insights? I want to stop feeling like a “helper” and start taking care of my own life. Hope that makes sense.",
