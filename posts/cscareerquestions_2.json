        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI’m approaching the one year mark as a contractor programmer in automation for big pharma. There’s a lot wrong from the get-go.\n\nWhen I was hired, I was put in place as one of two programmers implementing an automation tool in a new treatment area. It’s been used in other treatment areas, but not this one. The other programmer quickly disappeared as he had a lot of work to do on a different project (~3 months in). \n\nThis left me with my supervisor. No reference or training manuals were available for the tool, nor were any SMEs put in contact with me so that I could ask questions. Instead, I had many old pieces of code storied in various directories with little in the way of documentation.\n\nBy the eight month mark, my supervisor and I had gotten to a comfortable place, and our confidence in our work was growing. We were nearing completion, but due to isolation from the maintainers of the tool, our version adapted for this treatment area developed its own idiosyncratic differences. This was when I was I introduced to our co-team lead, who quickly began assigning overhauls of the tool on tight deadlines.\n\nAs it turns out, the co-lead was my “main boss”, I guess? His management style could not be any more different than the supervisor/other team lead I was working with. \n\nHe also started assigning me new projects. At this point, my mental health was seriously declining. It’d be accurate to call him a micro-manager. Despite my best efforts, my work was falling behind, and I took an emergency three day vacation. For understandable reasons from a business perspective, someone else was assigned to lead the small remainder of the project.\n\nSince then, I have completed a different, final project with this co-lead and no longer work on the tool. I did a good job and finished my tasks early relative to others on the project, but It’s been about a week and a half, and I haven’t been assigned more work. \n\nHe doesn’t say that he has more work coming; he just states, plainly, “I have no additional work.”\n\nI’m currently working on another project on a different team, “on loan” from old team. But it’s very simple to complete. \n\nI’m a bit afraid that I’m on the chopping block. I just can’t get a read on things. Am I overthinking things? It’s hard to believe, because I also know people with my skillset are hard to find.\n\nThanks - This is my first dev job. A lot of things we do are (for worse, not better) not in accordance with best practices in software development, because everyone’s a statistician. Drives me nuts. No github, etc. I digress. Advice is appreciated.",

Great guys and gals at the IC level, first line managers are brilliant.\n\nBut then we run into this attitude of  “we will close ranks against any outsiders” whenever there are  criticisms. We have retros involving teammates from different offices, and there are sometimes issues with the team in Tel Aviv. Examples: schedule slipping, missed stories, quality issues, etc. Again, these are not always showstoppers but there have been a couple of major production outages due to code released by our friends over there. This stuff happens with all offices but our friends in Tel Aviv get super super defensive when we bring these up in retros. Even the VP there refuses to hear any feedback from our leadership in the US. \n\nIt comes across as if any criticism is a personal or a nation-level insult. \n\nIt becomes so embarrassing that we have stopped bringing up any problems with our Tel Aviv office. We sulk and move on. This of course has been causing a lot of consternation and people would have left in a better job market \n\nFor those of you who are in Tel Aviv or work with folks there, do you have any tips to handle these situations and work more effectively?",

Again, as someone who also does research in AI I think the state of generation models is remarkable.

We could just use those and manually inspect the outputs.\nCEO: How about we do something like product recommendation through text generation?\nMe: There are tons of open source text generation models that do that without having to be ChatGPT.\nCEO: You're being too close-minded. It's so hard to communicate with you.\nMe: Um okay.\n```\n\nWhat's funny is that my CEO supposedly went to grad school at one of the best technical universities in my school and has a background in AI.\n\nI thought my Twitter and LinkedIn feed being flooded with ChatGPT was bad enough, but having to deal with these questions that the answers are clear to with just a tiny bit of thinking is starting to really irk me...",

The previous guy who wrote the source code of the application I have to rewrite is not a software engineer at all. He did well in that he learned to program on the side and built out the development application for this department while they had nobody else before I just joined (and that was for a year and a half) but well, that's the end of the positive. The code is a true mess and it's unreadable. He thinks comments are a waste of time until I told him they're not only for himself but also for others (such as me) who have to build on the code later.\n\nTurns out, this guy had been mandated as my supervisor even though he knows far less than me and has been just making life a hassle for me due to just being jealous that I've been getting the work done and quickly without a fuss. \n\nI told the boss today that a supervisor needs to know more than the supervisee and it didn't go down well and I've burned a bridge. He just doesn't want to give me the recognition that I am the software engineer.

And I also thought that the work on my main team would wind down a bit, so I would be able to maintain my wlb, while being split between the two teams.\n\nHowever, the last couple of weeks have changed my perception. Turns out my original team had more work planned for me, and my new team expects me to deliver my work in the next couple of months. It seems that they are softly pushing me to put in more hours, by imposing more aggressive deadlines on me.\n\nI wonder what’s really going on. Am I being forced out?",

I am starting to burn out and want to change career paths. I can't stand working with public agencies and utilities companies anymore.\n\nI've always loved programing and problem solving. Only have a barely working knowledge of python, and use it to make simple tools for our project management tracking. I've been taking a udemy course to get better at using python.\n\nI usually end up being the tech support and tool creator for every company I have worked for. I enjoy that type of work much more than creating blueprints for commercial developments.\n\nHow realistic is a career change and are bootcamps a reasonable route?",

I'm a contractor that didn't really know much out of college about the difference between different CS positions. After a little over a year, I was let go by my last client, and have been unable to land a new one, since it was the only local option, and external factors prevent me from relocating at this moment.\n\nI've been getting paid to do absolutely nothing for several months, and I'm not naive enough to think my company will put up with this indefinitely. I've yet to reach that magical 2 years experience, and what experience I do have isn't applicable to dev positions, which is where I eventually want to wind up, even if it's not immediately achievable.\n\nI need to do something, if only to minimize the damage if I am let go, but don't have the vaguest idea what. I say I'm going to start a personal project, but even if I had any ideas, I have no clue how much time I have to spare on it. I say I'm going to get a cert, but with so many options and an ambiguous time limit, I become paralyzed by choice. Maybe I can just start blindly applying places, but I can't imagine remote jobs are much more prevalent there for people with under 2 years experience.\n\nI don't mean to sound like a brat, but this isn't a situation I was ever prepared to be in. This isn't me saying \"I want to further my CS career without doing anything hard or uncomfortable\". I don't mind working hard (I'd honestly prefer it over several months alone with my own anxiety) but I'm so overwhelmed that I don't even know where to start, or what would be a worthwhile use of my time.",

None of these interviews were coding interviews, just questions about personality, experience, and previous projects. Each interview I feel like I did better than before, but I ultimately got rejected. I was mentally devastated as I thought I was so close. \n\nI am a new grad (Fall 2022) that has been applying to jobs since October 2022. There were times I was close to getting one, but I couldn't work full time due to me being in school. I have applied to closer to 200 positions. Majority have ghosted me or rejected me. This isn't me not leetcoding as only 2 of the interviews I've had have had me code. \n\nHere's what I've observed had me a less than stellar candidate:\n\n1.) No security clearance. Several entry level jobs where i fit the criteria require clearance \n\n2.) Little experience. I have less than a year (4 months) experience in the tech field as a Cyber Security Engineer intern. \n\n3.) Unfamiliarity with common languages, technologies, and frameworks.  I know about as much as I was taught in university, so I don't even know common programming languages like Java or c#.\n\nThere's probably more but I don't what they are. I can understand how number 3 can be fixed, but in what manner? I don't want to have to teach myself another language or technology, but it looks like the only way. But what should I learn? What would give me the best opportunity to get considered or even hired? And then how would I address reasons 1 and 2? I've gotten help with my resume (recently) so I know that's not an issue.\n\nMore importantly, what job positions should I be applying to besides Software developer or Software Engineer.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, and thank you.",

        "text": "I’m 19, at 18 years old I moved to nashville to pursue a music career. Music is a huge part of my life and I seriously could not live without it. However, in the music business it’s extremely hard to make even a livable wage. The sky is the limit but it’s so hard to get there and I’m kind of tired of going to bed every night wondering how I’ll be able to pay my rent and even eat. The money is jus weird in general and I might make 5 grand in a month or 0. There’s just no financial security for me and it’s stressful. Nashville is also really expensive. \n\nSo I started looking on indeed for some steadier income jobs related to music. And a lot of the things I saw had to do with audio related programming for video game companies.\n\nI had a friend of mine who dabbles in this stuff show me how he coded a website and I found it really interesting. \n\nSo these two things have really made me consider getting into it. I love music but I also love not being stressed out so if I could have a career in this, and do music when I have time that would be ideal. \n\nSo here’s the questions:\n\nIs the pay really as good as I see on places like indeed, and videos? (Usually between 100-200 grand in salary is what I’m told). I’m under the impression that starting out you can make 50-90 grand depending on the company and you can quickly work your way up. \n\nWhat does the average week look like? Is it 9-5 M-F? Like I said I’d still like to have a little time for music. And work towards that at least a LITTLE bit because at any moment it can blow up. And what does the title “software dev” entail as your day to day “activities” at work? \n\nIs this industry more “one-off” gigs or is there security in a company? \n\nThe music industry as well as most other industries have moved away from requiring a degree from a university, is that a safe assumption for this as well? (Obviously there are outlier companies but I’m talking as a whole)\n\nIf so, a coding boot camp seems like the way to go, so what are some credible camps that I should look into? \n\nWhat are the chances of landing a good paying secure job right out of a camp? I see alot them advertised that you don’t pay tuition until you get a job but I’m a little skeptical of that. \n\nThese are my questions, and if y’all have any other things that I should consider please let me know\n\nWorking with analog gear in the music industry, I’m pretty damn good at problem solving in high stress environments. \n\nAt the end of the day I just want to provide financial security for myself and my family, and at face value this line of work seems to be that thing. And this stuff actually interests me. \n\nI would just like to check any misconceptions I may have about this and any other thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance",

        "text": "  \n\nI graduated with a 3.1 GPA from a decent public school. Moreover, I have 6 months of experience as a software development intern that I acquired at the end of my academic career. To add to that I was hired shortly after graduating and I worked there for approximately 4 months. However, as a result of a change in circumstances, I found myself needing to move back home to be with my parents.\n\n\"Luckily\" I managed to secure a fully remote role that paid more than the role I had been working at for four months in person. It seemed like a no-brainer so I took the job offer. At first, everything seemed great. I had regular weekly meetings with my manager and they always told me I was doing a great job and thanked me for my hard work. Despite that, the reason I say \"luckily\" is because 4 months after quitting my first job and moving 500 miles. I was laid off in a company-wide layoff from the remote role I quit for. They stated it was due to a refinancing deal that fell through which left them lacking cash flow.\n\nThis brings me to today where I have been applying daily for four months with nothing but a single interview to show for it. I don't understand what it is I am doing wrong. I suspect my disjointed work history is scaring off potential employers but I am not certain. I am an honest person and I don't like to lie, but I am starting to consider simply pretending I worked at 1 company for 8 months before being fired instead of 2 companies for 4 months each. I want to work whether it is a remote, hybrid, or local role. Furthermore, I am okay with getting paid as low as 65,000 despite having been paid a whole lot more previously. I say this because my savings are quickly evaporating but nobody wants to hire me. What do you suggest I do? Is there anything I can do? Or is the economy truly this fucked?",

I'm unemployed now, but my last job was pretty much an introduction to full-stack web development.\n\nThe focus of my job was breadth across the front and backends, rather than depth in any one area. I went into the job knowing little to nothing about web development. I learned a lot in my time there, but I don't feel like I truly became competent, or close to competent, in any one part of web development.\n\nI've thought hard about what I need to do to land my next job, hopefully in web development, as that's the domain I've gotten professional experience in over the past year. I want to leverage that experience.\n\nI have three avenues I believe I can travel over the next several months in terms of my learning, and would love people's feedback on them.\n\n**Option 1: The Odin Project**\n\nFocus all my attention on the [Odin Project, full-stack JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?). My web development fundamentals definitely need work and polishing, and I think this project will give me that.\n\n**Option 2: Data Structures and Algorithms and LeetCode**\n\nI have very little training/practice with data structures and algorithms. Seeing as how so many companies require leetcode-style tests as part of the interview process, doing this feels necessary. I would take a course on data structures and algorithms, then immediately jump into practicing LeetCode.\n\nI'm not sure which is more important though... having solid web development skills as stated in Option 1, or having solid LeetCoding skills. I can only study one or the other (see more on this in option 3).\n\n**Option 3: Both 1 and 2**\n\nDo both options 1 and 2 at the same time. If time and resources weren't a consideration, I would choose this option. But my time and resources are limited, so this doesn't seem like the best option. Then again, maybe it's doable. I don't know and ideas on this are appreciated.",

I clarifying by saying  ummm is this about the architecture, I'm not sure I understand the question\"  Then my manager repeated it and I answered it and asked technical lead to pitch in.\n\nThen a minute or two after that i was still on unmute and my phone started ringing, loud. Pretty sure everyone on the call heard it. I muted myself, at that point the manager had just started to thank everyone and wrapping things up, I dropped off about 10 seconds after my phone rang (it was an important sort of call and the meeting had run over) but before everyone could say bye. \n\nNow I'm just riddled with anxiety thinking my it probably looks like my manager thought I wasn't paying attention.

How should I proceed with my job hunt process?  Should I focus solely on leetcoding/DSA and send out applications, or should I pick up other frameworks/language such as java/springboot + project using those to make myself more employable and upgrade my resume. Also should I get any certifications ? like AWS/Azure Thanks!",

I've been on a job hunt since a little after the new year, but I've been somewhat picky and not really in a rush.\n\nAbout a month ago, I started interviewing at Company A. I've done 3 interviews with people of varying levels of seniority, and most recently I've completed a small take home assignment I was given. All direct communication has been with a person from the company's HR department (scheduling interviews, etc). I would LOVE to work for Company A.\n\nAbout a week and a half ago, I started interviewing with Company B. I think it would be a fine place to work, and have no reason to be concerned about the work environment or people I'm working with. Company B gave me a verbal offer on Monday, and were happy to give me a week to make my decision. \n\nAfter receiving this offer, I reached out to Company A to let them know I had an offer at another company, and I have a week to make a decision. I didn't mention any details aside from that, and simply asked if the team at Company A would be able to get a decision to me in this timeframe. This email was sent to the HR person I had been in communication with, the same day I submitted the take home assignment I mentioned.\n\nI'm getting a little stressed with the clock ticking and not having heard back from Company A. I understand that sort of decision does not rest on the HR employee I've been communicating with, and I would assume they want to review the assignment I submitted. My question is ultimately if giving a bit of a shoulder tap today or tomorrow would be unreasonable, and come off like \"did I get the job? huh? what are you thinking?\" which is not my desire.

        "text": "Started very recently at my first job and my tasks are pretty simple but given the sheer volume of the technologies we use as well as the complexity of the system both in the part that my team owns and the system as a whole, I feel super overwhelmed, almost to where like I feel I get nothing done on some days even though I ask for help.\n\nOn the other hand there are other days where when I finished my tasks I have nothing to do and I feel like I’m just staring at my screen or reading internal wikis for hours. My team does a careful job of assigning me easy tickets (basically grunt work to them because they know the process) that let me figure out the system, so it’s either I get it quickly and have nothing to do afterwards, or I don’t and I ask for help. And when I’m done and ask for more stuff it’s usually too difficult and I need guidance/to bother someone about it.\n\n\nI have guilty if I just don’t do anything for most of the day. Sometimes like I have a single task left and my teammate has to walk me through it (specific procedure) and I have literally nothing to do until they’re free 2 hours later. At the same time my team and company always seem very busy. Even though WLB at my company and team is constantly praised by the employees I still feel bad if I don’t have like 8 or so hours of screen time even if I don’t do much. Like my teammates will tell each other to take breaks or stop working so hard (in a genuine way) but they themselves will be quite busy. And I’m sort of the opposite.\n\n\nIs this normal and I’m just overthinking?",

I  am not terrible with maths though hearing how much math is involved in  that job is a little off-putting. I don't have the intent of becoming  some ML-Professor, developing cutting edge improvements for ML or  creating completely new frameworks, I wanna be the guy who adapts the ML approach and possibly existing frameworks to solve real world problems for companies. If I do that will  it be equally heavy on the maths? \n\nAny insight is appreciated.",

I don’t really have any intent to try to go FAANG, or anything of that sort. I live in the Midwest, and don’t intend to relocate.

        "text": "Last Spring I graduated with a pretty high GPA from a good university with a CS degree and no internships. After \\~8 months of applying, tweaking my resume, building projects, grinding Leetcode, and the occasional tear I was finally hired as an SDE.\n\nThe past \\~8 have not been easy. I graduated with high hopes and a mound of student debt. I was constantly told by my friends and family that I would 'have no problem finding a job with a CS degree'. Boy was those folks wrong. I initially created my resume using a template found on this sub and added the projects I made in undergrad, as well as my previous part-time job (to emphasize soft skills). I had 1 phone interview in the first two months. I did not hear back. As time went on I looked to this sub for advice and tweaked my strategy to better my chances. I started to get more phone interviews and occasional recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn but nothing promising.\n\nI began to create projects to improve my resume, learn more, and expand my qualifications. I started with simple JavaScript websites and moved on to React and Angular. After about 3 months of still no results, I figured out how much money I had left before I would have to go back to my part-time job. I continued to grind Leetcode, build increasingly difficult projects, and applied for jobs every day. Eventually, I started building the projects not out of necessity, but out of enjoyment. The projects on my resume were more than good enough, but I was building websites for friends that wanted me to build something for them to use. It felt exciting and honestly kept me going. \n\nMy Leetcoding ability improved exponentially over those months and I became at peace that I may not find an SDE job before the money ran out. I carried on with my routine, and I received about 7 calls in early January. 4 of which resulted in Technical Interviews. All 4 were Leetcode Easy/Medium questions (3 of which I had seen before). I was able to solve all 4 but was offered the job at exactly 1 of the companies (the one I hadn't seen the question before). I accepted. \n\nI have been working there for about a month now and the weight of the world is off of me. I haven't felt this happy since I got accepted to my University 4 years ago. My undergrad was not easy. The job hunt however was incredibly more difficult. I went through dark mental battles while simultaneously being hounded by my parents that I'm, 'Not trying hard enough to find a job'. It's a euphoric feeling to finally be free from unemployment and parental scrutiny. \n\nI now understand what  Jim Morrison was talking about in his 1967 hit, Break on Through (To The Other Side). It was clearly a very poetic take on the Entry Level Software Engineering market in 2022-2023. I have broken into SDE and I am finally on the other side.",
