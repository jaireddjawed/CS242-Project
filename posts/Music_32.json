She was teaching a middle school and high school class the other night and most kids use ear phones for music. She brought up the question of their favs for music. The whole discussion revolved around The Legend of Zelda, Mario and other gaming music. She put it on the classroom speakers for all to hear, turned it up and they loved it. She said none of it had words. It was all instrumental. She and I listened later to it and found it to be a good style for working on art. Maybe even workouts. She said none of the kids mentioned any of the current \"popular\" singers that are out there and no rap, country or other music was even mentioned. This came from kids age 12-16 in the US.",
