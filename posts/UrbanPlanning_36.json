        "text": "Specifically, I'm thinking about something like an O'Neill cylinder, about 8km in diameter (so 25km in circumference) and 32km long, with a total surface area of ~803km^2. They spin for artificial gravity of 1g (same as earth), and have earth atmospheric pressure (from the range of human habitation - it could be as high as the Caspian sea or as low as Nepal). It would be constructed primarily from steel with dirt on top of it, so if it was built in the simplest way it would just be one cylindrical plain of ground. Agricultural land (which doesn't need high gravity or radiation shielding) would be housed outside the central cylinder, so the entire volume of the city can be residential, manufacturing, service, mixed use, etc. \n\nYou could add hills and valleys, likely through packing underneath the ground with some sort of solidified aerated (to reduce weight) rock, so no topography is off limits aside from canyons and very deep lakes. Things to consider is that travel in two directions (spinward and antispinward) is infinite and you eventually end up back where you started, the end caps of the cylinder form a strong and stable surface to attach arbitrarily large buildings to (as long as they can be welded to steel to support their own weight), and as you go further up gravity gets weaker, in a linear gradient between the surface (1g) and 8km up in the centre (zero gravity - weightlessness). The first kilometre up shouldn't be a major issue because at the top you'll still have 3/4 gravity.\n\nAgain, I recognise this is a weird question, but it interests a lot of sci-fi and space colonisation fans out there and I've been thinking to myself about what urban planning would look like in such a bizzare area, where you could look up and see someone's backyard 24km away by walking (but only 8km straight line), unless there was a lower ceiling in place. It would look, most of the time, like being in a large valley as you can see the ground rise up to either side, but gravity and inclination would be the same all over. What would public transportation look like, and is it even need in a space that large? Could everyone who is able just ride a bike or walk? Shipping and logistics would come in at the centre of the endcap in either end (from spacecraft docking with the station and transferring goods inside), so there'd need to some way to transport goods and people to and from anywhere on the surface 4km up and up to 16km laterally. The community would in some sense be built (because the land is built), so how should it be set up to best allow natural growth and progression? What is the maximum population you could house in such a cylinder, and how would it compare in size of population and area to our metropolises?",

And 1-wheels, scooters/skateboards etc. may work for people who don't want to deal with something as large as a standard bicycle or are too lazy to pedal. Sure it doesn't work for everyone but it could replace a lot of short car trips for most people. \n\nI know the scooter share thing in SF has been a disaster, but even then, it's shown that many people are open to the idea of doing something with smaller vehicles, avoiding driving or attempting another way to reach somewhere that's a bit too far to walk for their schedule. When I visited SF I saw these things everywhere and people were using them. \n\nI think Amsterdam is almost perfect now with the ejection of mopeds from the cycle paths, but getting Americans onto bicycles has always seemed impossible. Maybe this will be the catalyst for standard bicycle infrastructure improvements. Do any of you think these electric vehicles will result in more cycle path-like infrastructure or revised sidewalk planning, etc., or have any articles on the subject to share?",

        "text": "This is my theory as to why SB 827 was tried in the CA Legislature. I think it was destined to fail from the start, and it achieved its intent perfectly. \n\nThe idea of the bill was not for it to pass, with such radical height dimensions around transit stops there was no way this could ever get past NIMBY or even concerned state senators. I have a feeling that Sen Scott Weiner knew this and only wanted the bill to raise public attention to the issue, as something this aggressive would have people up in arms writing in every news outlet across the state. The fact that r/LosAngeles top post is talking about the failure of this bill, and the comments are all saying that the failure was a bad thing proves that people were swayed on this issue, and if a more moderate approach was taken maybe it could’ve passed. \n\nMy suspicion is soon enough Scott will introduce a rolled back version of this bill, or a package of bills that politicians can actually get behind. The reason he didn’t put this milder bill first was because back then that would been seen as extreme, automatically stopping it in its tracks. By trying this extreme bill first and then the rolled back one, he is employing the political strategy called the Overton Window. It’s when something extremely radical is proposed or said that shocks everyone, so when anything milder is shown it seems reasonable in comparison. [Vox](https://youtu.be/_v-hzc6blGI) has a great video on the topic (but do excuse the cringy jokes and camera zooms). Just imagine replacing the crazy shit said with SB 827 and the moderates with the new bill.\n\nBut then again this is just my theory as to why this bill was put forward, and I have no evidence to back up my claims. But if I turn out to be right then I’ll feel good about myself \n\n(Sorry for the poor writing, I have school in 5 hours and I just really wanted to get this out there before I forgot what I was going to say tomorrow.)",
