        "text": "  \n\nThe house was old, the poorly finished paint made it look even worse. I was holding a pamphlet, the address was correct.\n\n“Contact your deceased loved one, seances with medium Samantha”.\n\nA gray-haired lady invited me in.\n\n\\-My name is Gabriel, I am here because of this pamphlet.\n\n\\-Lost someone?\n\n\\-Yes, my girlfriend is... was called Larissa, she got hit by a drunk driver and passed away last week. I want to talk to her one last time, I need to say goodbye.\n\nSamantha agreed to hold the séance. She called 4 associates, and the six of us sat around a table. Eighteen candles formed a circle behind the members, making three circles in total: The table, the six people, and the eighteen candles.\n\n\\-When calling the spirits they can use any of the six doors present. We will hold hands in a circle. Do not let go of the hand of the person beside you, if the circle is broken, the spirit that has been manifested will no longer be trapped in the other world, and will be able to remain in ours. Some spirits pretend not to be among us and try to undo the circle. If you feel the colleague next to you try to let go of your hand, hold on tight, let me know and I'll end the séance. Keep your mind calm and light, if you let negative feelings such as dread, extreme sadness, hatred, among others dominate your minds, your body will be weakened and the spirit may not leave at the end of the séance. If I sense something wrong, we end the séance. Any questions?\n\nI nodded no. Samantha projected her voice:\n\n\\-Recent and ancient spirits present in this room, I ask for your silence and that only Larissa, recently uprooted from her body from the dimension of the living, communicate with us. Answer me Larissa, to calm the grieving heart of those who love you, are you present in this room?\n\nNothing happened. We kept silent for a few minutes. Samantha repeated the same mantra, and after it failed a few times, she said a few words in a language I didn't understand. About an hour into the séance, the atmosphere began to change. The room had a heavy, suffocating air. I felt tired listening to the spoken words, I rambled, I couldn't concentrate. The room cooled slightly, the hairs on my arms stood on end, chills crisscrossed my entire body like electric shocks. A mild headache regained my concentration, with twinges slicing through one side of my brain internally. A girl who was sitting next to me started tugging at my hand, seeming to want to let go. I held her hand tightly. I looked to the side and noticed a look of fear on her face. She stared at everyone present at the table, wide eyes and a clear expression of confusion.\n\n\\- Hihi. - She giggled, as if she'd remembered a joke.\n\nEveryone fixed their attention on her. She was smiling in a sort of robotic way, as if an android was trying to imitate human reactions. Her eyes darted back and forth quickly, staring at everyone there.\n\n\\-I... You... Where...\n\nSamantha interacted with the girl:\n\n\\-Larissa? It's okay, we're your friends. Do you remember what happened to you?\n\n\\-I was in a hurry, the rain was blocking my vision – she said looking at the table as if she was trying to remember – I wanted, I just wanted… – she began to cry and slowly lowered her head towards the table, leaving tthe face hidden and only the back of his head showing.\n\n\\-Everything is fine, everything is fine. - Samantha repeated trying to calm the atmosphere.\n\nThe girl lifted her head a little later, she wasn't crying anymore, despite having her face slightly wet because she couldn't use her hands to dry the tears. She glared at me.\n\n\\-Why are you doing this?\n\n\\-I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.\n\n\\-Selfishness, then?\n\nThe serious expression of the girl looking at me knocked the ground out of my feet. I had rehearsed thousands of things I wanted to say, but I froze with the situation finally happening in front of me. I ignored her query.\n\n\\-How is life on the other side?\n\n\\-I'm feeling lonely. All I wanted was to have you by my side, I can't wait to see you again.\n\n\\-We 'll see each other again. I miss you so much.\n\n\\-When, Gabriel? I can't wait, I need you now.\n\nSamantha started talking before I could interact.\n\n\\-Spirits present, we appreciate your contact, now we need to part ways, goodbye.\n\nWe let go of each other hands and broke the circle. I was a little upset:\n\n\\-Why did you end the séance? We sat at the table for over an hour without anything happening, and when I was finally talking to her you took Larissa out of the circle.\n\n\\-It wasn't Larissa.\n\n\\-What? How do you know?\n\n\\-It was someone trying to deceive you. There are spirits who chose to stay on the dimension closest to ours, enjoying our interactions. They take every opportunity they can get trying to get humans to do things for them, they have fun with it.\n\n\\-What do you mean, what did it want me to do?\n\n\\-It wanted you to commit suicide. I've seen it happen before, when couples try to make contact with a deceased partner, this kind of spirit appears, saying they want the living to join them, pretending to be the loved one. I'm really sorry Gabriel, but Larissa didn't want to show up or isn't in a dimension where this is possible. If she wanted to, she would have shown up already.\n\n\\-Can't we try again another day?\n\n\\-I don't keep working when the spirit refuses contact. If we try again, it's too dangerous. The more we call the greater the possibility of unwanted spirits appearing. I can hand you contacts of people who make extra attempts, but I strongly advise against it.\n\n\\-Okay, I understand.\n\nI paid for the consultation and left. I believed everything the medium had said, she had no reason to lie. It was more profitable for her to keep trying to contact Larissa, saying that it was dangerous and unlikely made me face reality. My girlfriend was dead and I would never see her again.\n\nWhen I got home I sat in the kitchen looking at the wall, reflecting on everything that had happened. I lay down on the bed afterwards. I heard a strange noise, like someone was moving things in the next room. I turned on the light and went to check. My legs started to give out from what I saw. There was a portrait with a picture of me hugging Larissa, the memory of our interaction came back to me.\n\n“Couple photo, Larissa? What a cheesy gift.”\n\n“I want to see this picture on your table Gabriel, if you complain I'll make you wear a T-shirt with my face on it, then you'll find out what cheesiness is.”\n\nHolding the portrait with a smile on her face, there she was, Larissa. She gently placed the portrait back on the table and hugged me. I returned the hug, not holding back the tears anymore. She stood on tiptoe and gave me a kiss on the cheek before turning and walking away. I tried to follow her, but she disappeared as she left my sight. I laid down again, falling asleep after a few minutes. When I woke up, the unoccupied side of my bed was scarred, as if someone had slept next to me that night. I cried, I knew it was goodbye. \n\nI would never see her again.\n\n[X](https://www.wattpad.com/1320484705-insanity-chronometer-chapter-1-fog)",

        "text": "I've been having the same reoccurring nightmare since I was a kid. Some guy in a bath robe floats above my bed and talks to himself. Nothing too scary, just all about me and my family, like he's watching. Like he's been watching us for a long time. No matter where we moved, it was always the same. It finally went away once I moved out and got married. Well it happened a lot less often. A couple times a year I would have the same dream. He always talked about my life like he was some spectator. \n\nWell one night I was having a particularly vivid dream- the kind where you know you're not awake and you're in complete control of the whole dream and suddenly I'm in my bed and this bathrobe guy shows up again. He starts talking to himself about what my next chapter in life is going to be so I surprise him and  start telling him all my plans. It gives him a good scare and he runs away. The weirdest part is I don't see him again until all my kids are grown up and I have a couple grandkids of my own. \n\nThis time he's speaking directly to me. He seems different. Serious. He's been visiting every night for the past 10 years and tells me the same story ver batim. His story. I've heard it so many times, I've decided to write it down and immortalize it here. Seems appointment since I have lost a lot of sleep myself. Maybe once I tell him I put his story out there he'll leave me alone. I feel sorry for the guy.\n\nAnyways heres what he tells me every night:\n\n\"On my 8th birthday, I became obsessed with the concept of death. When I say obsessed, I don't mean like my older sister was obsessed with academia or like my older brother was obsessed with his own face. When I say obsessed, I mean like the people who wash their hands hundreds of times a day- till they're dry and cracked and bleeding in fear of bacteria. I mean like the people who spend an extra hour checking and rechecking the lock on their door is working properly any time they leave the house. My young and anxious mind latched onto the concept of death and couldn't be convinced to let go. I was utterly, deeply, completely terrified. No amount of pondering could ease it: no distraction could pacify it. Death was inescapable and one day, regardless of how I felt about it, I would face it.\n\n\"I have never believed in an afterlife despite a very religious upbringing. I was always taught in Sunday School that life goes on- that death is not the end but a new beginning. I parroted these beliefs to my parents and teachers but was never truly convinced. Maybe the constant discussion of the afterlife is what made me this way. Maybe, like all humans, I'm just desperate to blame something for the way that I am. In any case, ever since my 8th birthday, I have only seen the world as a collection of things that will all die and turn to dust and it all but paralyzed me for my entire life.\n\n\"My 8th birthday was perfect. After all the festivities, my friends and I set out to catch a lizard as we had done countless times before. In our mad dash, we managed to chase it up a tree higher than any one of us could reach. I came up with the brilliant idea of throwing rocks at the spot above it to scare it downwards. All my friends tossed pebbles and hit their mark but I opted for a larger stone and fell short of where I aimed. I crushed the lizard's head and it fell at our feet in a curled up twitching heap; blood leaked from one eye. A terrible silence took all of us as we stared down at the quivering thing. The merciful thing would have been to ensure it could no longer suffer but none of us knew anything about that. \n\n\"So we stared. \n\n\"One by one, my friends ran off elsewhere and began a new game but I lingered there with the pit in my stomach. The lizard shook slower and slower until it lay there as still as the rock that struck it. I recall wondering how something so full of life with such a strong will to live and outrun us all only moments ago could now be reduced to a mere inanimate object- a husk. I watched until all my friends had gone. I watched until the ants came. I watched until my sweet mother had the sense to cover it with a pile of dirt and a pretty rock for a headstone- the same rock that killed it. But I could still see it. Even after I went inside; even after I had dinner; even after a month; even now I still see the ants, and the bloody eye socket and the rock that felt so heavy in my right hand. I had taken the life right out of it, never to be put back in. \n\n\"When people talk about the fear of death they always focus on the events immediately leading up to it and the exact moment itself. We talk about the manner in which death finds us and compare which is worse and which is preferable. We talk about the state of mind one finds oneself in as their time concludes and we philosophize how to make our deaths meaningful. What people don't mention as often is the part that terrified me- the part that kept me up every night since I turned 8: what comes after. \n\n\"I mentioned my crippling fear of death but, to be entirely accurate, my true fear has always been The Void. Oblivion. The complete nothingness that awaits us all. Have you ever been somewhere so completely dark that you could put your hand right in front of your face and not see it? I have. Only, in death, you don't have any hands. You don't have any eyes. You have nothing. You are nothing. You are surrounded by nothing. You cease to exist. Like the lizard, one moment, you're full of life with such a strong will to live and outrun all things that would end you and the next moment, you are an inanimate object- a husk. Only you're not the husk. The husk is what you leave behind. You disappear. You enter a never ending pit and plummet for the rest of eternity with an infinite nothingness surrounding you. My vivid childhood imagination conjured life-like nightmares of that void. Floating. Falling. Unable to scream. \n\n\"It wasn't until my twenties that I finally found a foothold of solace. A close friend of mine that indulged my macabre obsession with a defiant grin remarked that if I truly cease to exist after I died, then I wouldn't even be able to experience this void anyways. If I could no longer see or hear or think because my brain stopped working, then I couldn't reasonably expect to hear or see or feel any of the darkness I expected to experience after dying. I could breathe again. This beautiful human had pointed out what was right in front of me all along. The void had lost its hold on me. I clung to my witty savior and they clung to me and we built a beautiful life together for 15 years until the first time I died.\n\n\"I didn't even realize I had died the first time it ever happened. What started as butterflies turned to uncomfortable chest flutters then to cold sweats and shooting pains down my left arm. Most people would say the next thing they remember after losing consciousness is waking up in the hospital but I remember watching my love press on my chest until it cracked without any pain. I remember standing over my pale body in the ambulance as they blew through traffic lights. I remember seeing my body flinch and hearing the punch of 3000 volts enter my body. I remember lying back down as my body regained consciousness. I thought it was all a dream. But I never woke up in my own bed. Days passed and I recovered. Weeks passed and life went back to normal. After a month I finally accepted the fact that I had an actual out of body experience. Did this happen to everyone? \n\n\"I spent the better part of a year searching for others like me. I missed work. I stopped sleeping. I kept my love at arms distance. I found a few others who reported floating above their beds or flying off into space but nothing quite like what I had experienced. The implications paralyzed me again. I had no idea what to think. One night, while I was up late typing a letter to a neurologist, inquiring about the brain's ability to sustain its operations in the loss of blood flow and oxygen, I found the keys would no longer type. The page wouldn't scroll. I went to the kitchen for a beer and to allow myself a break when I found the fridge door was completely sealed shut. No matter how hard I pulled, I could not get it to budge. In my frustration I returned to my study only to see the silhouette of a man sitting in my chair. My brain flipped a coin for fight or flight and it decided to freeze instead. Finally, I gained the courage to shout at the man. If I woke up my love, they could come assist me but the house stayed still and silent. I cursed the man and threatened him with a rage and determination I didn't know I possessed but he didn't move and my love didn't stir in the next room. In utter disbelief I stomped toward the man and grabbed him by the neck but he did not move- no matter how I squeezed. \n\n\"Suddenly, my blood ran chill and frozen lightning crashed in my spine as I recognized the pattern on his bath robe; it was mine. His lifeless face was mine. I clutched at my lifeless body, slumped in my chair. This out of body experience had completely come by surprise. I rushed to the bedroom to call my love to my aid. I leapt on top of them. I screamed and shook them but, just as I couldn't open the fridge door, I could not reach my love. With wide eyes I saw their chest gently rise and fall and their eyes dashed about behind closed lids- full of life. I sprinted back to my body and tried with every ounce of desperation building in my throat to step back into myself but it was like trying to step through a stone wall. After some time, I stopped and stood above my body wondering what I would do. For what felt like an eternity I stood over my husk. I watched the sunlight slowly fill the room. I watched my love prepare breakfast and coffee for two. I watched them shriek and wail for a time, at my feet. I watched the coroner zip my body into a black bag. I watched my love stare into space for hours- never to be the same again. I couldn't console them. I could help them.\n\n\"I didn't go to my funeral. \n\n\"I've been dead for several decades now. After a week I discovered I could float through the air if I chose to. Gravity has no effect on whatever I am now, though I can't pass through walls or solid objects. Anyone on the street oblivious of my presence will knock me aside without any resistance at all. For years I followed my love everywhere they went. I fancied myself a guardian angel and believed somewhere, deep inside, they could somehow hear me. That if I shouted loudly enough, I could influence them. I was wrong.\n\n\"I shouted so loudly not to drive after drinking so much. Louder than the rev of the engine. Louder than the bumps they put on the side of the road to let distracted drivers know they've veered too far. Louder than the blare of the truck's horn in the oncoming lane. Louder than the crash and the screech of metal as my love's car was pulled straight underneath the bigger vehicle. \n\n\"This tragedy spelled hope for me. I waited to see my love emerge from the pile of twisted metal- not their body but the part of them that was all that's left of me. I watched and waited. I saw the truck driver step out and clutch at his hair. I saw the crowds of people start to form on the sidewalks. I heard his trembling voice tell them to call 911. I saw them pull the mangled husk of my love out piece by piece. I saw them tow the wreckage and clean the broken glass. I saw the crowds move on and life return to normal. My love never came. \n\n\"I spent 10 years drifting to all the national parks in America. For a time I found some solace in the beauty of nature. I began talking to myself about anything and everything. I could speak to no one else. I spent a few dozen years following a particularly busy family with colorful personalities. Their children grew, went to college, started their own families and the parents died. Neither of them joined me. The smallest glimmer of hope came one night as I watched the eldest child asleep with their spouse. As I talked to myself about what I thought might happen next in their life, this child began to answer me in their sleep. I will admit I was frightened. I moved on. \n\n\"I spent what I estimate to be 30 years completely and utterly lost. I drifted as high as I dared to go in the sky. I stayed there for days with the clouds and sun. I drifted over the ocean. Eventually I couldn't see land any more. I lost all sense of direction and spent what felt like years drifting in one direction without ever seeing land. I decided to plunge into the ocean. The blue abyss became blacker and blacker the deeper I went until all around me was nothing. I could hear nothing, see nothing and feel nothing. I knew I hadn't reached the bottom because I would have felt resistance. I lost sense of what was up and what was down. \n\n\"I remembered how I had always feared this. Why had I come here? What was the point? Would I ever see the sun again? I willed so hard that I could stop existing. I tried with every ounce of my being to just fade away. \n\n\"I lingered there for an eternity.\n\n\"Eventually I felt resistance. I had hit something. Whether it was the bottom of the ocean or the wall of a cliff, I didn't know but I resigned myself to going in the opposite direction. Black became blue once again. And I finally emerged from my once eternal darkness. I followed a passing cruise ship to somewhere where everyone speaks Spanish. Where once I would have found joy in seeing happy families enjoy a vacation, I now felt nothing. \n\n\"One day I will return to my eternal abyss. I will be fully conscious of the black nothingness that will surround me for eternity. But there is one last thing I must do. I must find the one who spoke to me in their sleep. I must have one last real conversation and tell my story. I have to try.\"",

        "text": "I discovered this recently. I can't look in mirrors. If I catch a glimpse I see something horrifying. and it is every single time. I am really scared.\n\nMy name is Mark. I am a non married single man.  I work as a boring masonry worker in central Texas. I woke up around 6 am. It was a Monday, As this morning came, I heard my annoying alarm and got up as I usually do. I put on my clothes, have breakfast, brush my teeth then I am ready for work. But this morning was different than the others. I woke up to a strange tingly and cold feeling all around my spine, it was extremely unnerving and uncomfortable. \n\nI decided I was going to ignore it but it kept getting worse. But not just getting worse overtime, it was getting worse specifically, specifically when I was going closer to my bedroom mirror. I was trying my best to ignore it but it was quite difficult. After I changed I left the room and went downstairs, the pain stopped. My daily breakfast choice is usually a bowl of blueberry oatmeal. So I made that and sat down. After breakfast I brushed my teeth straight away. Work started at around 7:00 in the morning. it was 6:15. And I lived around 30 minutes away from work.\n\n As I entered the bathroom I suddenly had this horrific pain in my spine and jolted forward. It was awful. The pain was incredible, and felt like 1000 bees were stinging me at the same time. I know it is gross but I decided to skip brushing my teeth due to the awful. I opened the door to my old rusty nissan. I was living on a low budget. Then I drove off to work.\n\nWhen I arrived I got out the car to walk to the new area we were trying to finish off building, it was a house someone wanted to be built, nothing interesting really. I arrived and got to work with a couple other friends on the job. Something smelt... Odd. No it wasn't the cement or the bricks we were laying. It was something odd. Something you wouldn't be smelling as a masonry worker. It smelt like something was rotting in the air. I asked one of my friends Matthew but he couldn't smell anything, neither the others.\n\nWork finished and I was kind of concerned, the morning and now this? I felt like a something was particularly staring at me on the way home.  I got home and decided I was just going to go straight to bed due to the quite strange day I just had. But before I went to sleep I saw this... Creature, this... Thing. It was extremely skinny, it had no eyes and was around 8 feet tall. I had a shiver go down my whole body. I didn't believe in ghosts, nor this. I was petrified. It was leaning over me, and all I could hear was it's loud breathing. I closed my eyes, praying for it to go away, so I could way up to the morning and not have to worry about this anymore. \n\nI opened my eyes, it was the morning. I felt like I was hungover but from what I remember I didn't drink anything the night before. I was still concerned about the night before. I looked at my alarm. 4:36 pm. WHAT! I had over slept. I must have done. This was a disaster, I can't go to work now. I will be told off! \n\nI decided I would stay in that night. And come up with some pathetic excuse. I still was sitting in my bed. It was 5:40. Time moved so fast! It was dark outside now. I got up and quickly turned to face my mirror... There it was. The thing. But it was in the mirror. I looked back quickly then turned my head back again to face the mirror. Shit, it was closer. I didn't know what to do. I was stuck here. I felt thousands of chills running down my spine, and that pain started to go down my spine again. I felt like I couldn't breath. It was getting worse and worse each second. I knew that if I turned away it would start getting closer to me. I \\*\\*am\\*\\* stuck. \\*\\*Help me\\*\\*",

        "text": "August 6th, 2022. 21st birthday for Gary. He had a big night. Waking up in his room wearing only socks. His brown hair is really messy and has lots of knots. There's dry spit all over the left side of his face. The bedsheets are still straight. And weirdly, no signs of drinks in his room. \"Ah! Man, what happened? Who was here last night? Darn...I don't remember. What time is it?\" He looks at his phone, which has 27% battery. The time says 10:32 am and there are 7 missed calls from his boss, Juan. \"Oh no, Juan is gonna be so mad!\" Gary hurries to get ready super fast. 10 second tooth brushing, deodorant on just 1 arm, and his bright red work clothes are kinda dark. \"Did I have fun last night?\" He wonders as he's about to go to work. \"I guess I must've. But my poor liver.\" Gary gets into his old grey 2001 Ford F-150, which uses a lot of gas. When he takes out his keys, his phone rings. It's his boss. He answers after thinking for a bit. \"Darn...\" he whispers. He answers. \"Hey, Juan I'm really sorry I'm late I'm getting in my car now.\" Juan isn't as mad as he should be. Gary was supposed to be there at 5:30am to help open. \"I'm not mad, but you need to be here. I get being young, but work is important.\" He says in a strong but not mean way. \"I know, you're right I'm sorry...I'm getting in my truck. I'll be there in 15.\" \"I'll be here.\" Juan says and hangs up. Gary has a little trouble unlocking the truck because the lock is sticky, but he gets in. He puts the keys in, turns them, and...nothing happens. Scared, he calls Juan again. It goes right to voicemail. \"What? Maybe his phone died? Weird.\" He texts Juan about what's happening. He tells him he'll have to wait for an Uber. That could take 5 minutes or an hour. \"$45 for an Uber? Wow!\" He tries to call his girlfriend, Jace Gibson. They've been dating for almost 2 years. She doesn't pick up. \"C'mon, Jay...\" he sits on the curb feeling mixed up and sad. Then he feels a weird poke in his arm. \"Ow! That was definitely a fire ant.\"\nGary felt like everything was against him today. First his hangover, then being late for work, his truck not starting, and now fire ants? He couldn't help but wonder if this was karma for having too much fun last night. As he sat there waiting for the Uber, a stray cat approached him. It was a small black cat with bright green eyes. Gary, being a cat lover, couldn't help but smile. \"Hey there, little guy. Are you having a better day than me?\" He reached out to pet the cat, which seemed to enjoy the attention. \"Maybe you're my good luck charm,\" Gary said hopefully. As if on cue, his phone chimed. It was a notification that his Uber was just around the corner. He said goodbye to the cat and hopped into the Uber, hoping the rest of his day would turn around. As Gary slid into the backseat of the Uber, the driver greeted him with a friendly smile. \"Hey there, you're Gary, right? I'm Tom. Where are you headed?\" Gary gave Tom the address to his workplace and tried to relax as they began the drive. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, but he chalked it up to his terrible morning and lingering hangover.\nUpon arriving at work, Gary immediately sought out Juan to apologize again. To his surprise, Juan seemed unusually calm and understanding. \"Don't worry about it, Gary. We all have rough mornings. Just make sure it doesn't become a habit.\" Gary nodded in agreement, grateful for Juan's leniency, and got to work, trying to make up for his tardiness.\nThroughout the day, Gary couldn't help but think about the events of the morning. He felt like he was being watched, and he caught glimpses of the black cat with bright green eyes from earlier. Was it following him? He shook off the thought, telling himself he was just being paranoid.\nAfter a long day at work, Gary was eager to head home and unwind. As he was about to leave, Juan stopped him. \"Hey, I just wanted to check on you. You seemed a bit off today. Everything okay?\" Gary hesitated for a moment before deciding to tell Juan about the strange occurrences, including the cat that seemed to be stalking him. Juan laughed it off, but he could see the worry in Gary's eyes. \"Look, I'm sure it's just a coincidence. Maybe the cat is just lost and looking for a home. Don't worry about it too much.\"\nAs Gary walked back to his still-broken-down truck, he saw the black cat again. This time, it was sitting on the hood of his truck, staring directly at him with its unblinking green eyes. He felt a chill run down his spine, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. A sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves around him, and the streetlights flickered ominously. The cat's eyes seemed to glow in the dim light, and it slowly opened its mouth to reveal sharp, gleaming teeth. And then, with a hiss that sounded almost like a whisper, the cat spoke, \"You're not alone, Gary.\" Just as the words left the cat's mouth, the streetlights went out, plunging Gary into darkness as his heart raced in fear.",

        "text": "In the quaint little town of Edgewater, where time seemed to have come to a standstill, there existed secrets that lay dormant, waiting to be unearthed. The tall trees that surrounded the town whispered their eerie songs, and the shadows they cast danced like spirits on the ground. It was here that Jack, a man seeking solace and a new beginning, found himself. He was desperate to leave behind the relentless pace of city life, and the weight of a tragic past that haunted him.\nJack rented a small, weathered house at the edge of town, just a stone's throw away from an old gas station. It was a place frozen in time, with its rusted pumps and faded sign. Eager to find work and immerse himself in the simple life, Jack applied for a job as a gas station clerk. The owner, Mr. Jenkins, was an enigmatic old man who seemed to have been a part of Edgewater since the town's inception. With a sly grin and a knowing glint in his eyes, he hired Jack on the spot.\nAs Jack settled into his new role, he couldn't help but notice the strange behavior of the townspeople. They were a peculiar lot, barely speaking to him and darting furtive glances his way. Each visit to the gas station was brief, and the few words they exchanged were hollow, almost rehearsed.\nOne night, Jack found himself alone at the gas station. As the wind howled outside, he could almost hear whispers in the air, weaving in and out of the rustling leaves. Just as he was about to close up, a hooded figure appeared at the door, their face hidden in shadow. Jack's heart raced, but his curiosity got the better of him, and he let the stranger in.\nThe hooded figure moved closer, the lamplight revealing an old woman with milky white eyes. She seemed to see right through Jack, and in a raspy voice, she warned him, \"You don't belong here. Leave before the darkness consumes you.\"\nJack, frightened but defiant, refused to leave. He had come to Edgewater to escape his past, and he was determined to stay. The old woman shook her head in sorrow and vanished into the night.\nThe following days saw the strangeness of Edgewater intensify. Shadows lengthened, twisting and turning like living things, and the whispers in the wind grew louder, more insistent. Jack felt his grip on reality slipping, as the darkness seeped into his very soul.\nLate one night, as Jack stumbled through the gas station, he found a hidden door behind the counter. With trembling hands, he opened it, revealing a staircase that led down into a dimly lit chamber. At the center of the room stood a massive, ancient book bound in leather, and etched with symbols that seemed to writhe and change as he looked at them.\nWithout understanding why, Jack felt compelled to read the cryptic text aloud. As he spoke the final word, a monstrous, inhuman scream echoed through the chamber. The shadows around him surged forward, swallowing him whole.\nThe next morning, Mr. Jenkins arrived at the gas station, wearing that same sly grin. He opened the door, revealing the new clerk, a man named Jack, who had been in Edgewater for as long as anyone could remember. The darkness had claimed him, and the cycle began anew.",

        "author": "WeirdBryceGuy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11tn3oj/plantbased_products_almost_ruined_my_life_im_done/",
        "text": "Accepting the challenge of my best friend Lexi, I decided to “go vegan” for a week, with the conceit that she’d pay for all the plant-based meat substitutes. She happily agreed, promising that I’d realize all the things I loved about meat could be easily produced with near-complete verisimilitude in properly spiced &amp; flavored vegan dishes. I was, naturally, doubtful; I explained to her that a big part of meat’s appeal – at least for me – was the texture, something I couldn’t imagine tofu or soy or cauliflower being able to adequately mimic. She replied to this with a sarcastic, vaguely sexual remark, and insisted that I’d leave it all behind once I embraced the world of veganism.  \n\nWith a fridge and pantry decently stocked with grains, oats, fruits, veggies, and all varieties of fake cheese and meat-mimicking substances, I whole-heartedly began my week as a vegan. To my surprise, the first few days sped by. I had figured that I’d always be hungry, perpetually unsatisfied by the less-than-cleverly named imitators of beef, chicken, and pork; but with my diet being more fibrous than usual, I found myself getting fuller, faster. I wasn’t necessarily *enjoying* the meat-bereft meals, but with even the most egregious carbs still technically counting as being vegan, I didn’t hate them, either. The surplus of fruits and veggies in my diet was pretty nice, too; I realized just how nutritionally deficient I’d been before, when meat had constituted the bulk of my portions. \n\nIt had all been going so well, until Friday, when it all spiraled out of control. I couldn’t have ever imagined the wholesale chaos that occurred; couldn’t have predicted with any reasonable degree of forethought the events of that disastrous, terrifying morning.  \n\nI woke up feeling unusually hungry, *surprisingly hungry,* since I’d figured that my body had already acclimated to the sudden dietary shift. I hadn’t felt that hungry the previous few days, so I figured that I’d somehow slipped up in getting enough calories the previous day. I got out of bed, headed straight to the kitchen, and with an audibly growling stomach began making myself some berry-mixed cereal; with almond milk and a banana on the side. As I sat at my kitchen table eating, my stomach continued to growl; even as I fed it spoonful after hefty spoonful of cereal. \n\nThere was no accompanying pain, no feelings of indigestion or gastrointestinal unrest; and yet, for some inexplicable reason, it continued to growl. The tummy tumult sounded like a train rumbling along, with my intestines the ill-maintained tracks. I finished up breakfast and did what any reasonable person would do – Google'd my symptoms. After gravely accepting and then promptly dismissing several terminal diagnoses, I decided to see if I could just *walk it off.*  \n\nMy “walk” promptly ended after I’d taken about six steps from my sink. I tried to grab ahold of the counter before falling, but my hand slipped, and my face caught the fall. Ordinarily, I would’ve been pretty pissed at my uncharacteristic lack of dexterity; but the flare of pain in my face distracted me somewhat from the sudden and rapidly intensifying agony in my stomach.  \n\nAs I lay there on the tile, it felt as if something was pressing against the interior of my stomach, trying to push itself through my gut. There aren’t words – not any that I’ve learned –which could accurately paint a picture of how much excruciating pain I was in. On some cell-deep, sub-primal level, I sensed a force beyond flesh tugging at - or pressing upon - my stomach, manipulating it in some peripheral way. It was as awful as it was perplexing. \n\nIn what I’d hardly describe as my proudest moment, I vomited onto the floor – right near my face. And, as if my body desperately wanted to make me look as pathetic as possible, I went into a spasming fit. For nearly a full minute I writhed around in my vomit; the rank stench of molten bile bringing hot tears to my eyes.  \n\nUnfortunately, I’d left my phone in my room, and couldn’t call the paramedics or poison control. For a few merciful seconds the cataclysmic maelstrom in my stomach let up, and in that short-lived interim I managed to roll away from the smeared pool of esophageal gunk; but then the pain was reignited by some unknown trigger, and I again found myself convulsing uncontrollably.  \n\nFor a moment I actually believed that I would die; that I had unwittingly ingested something inimical to human life; some insidious, digestively malignant toxin. I thought back on all I’d eaten, and while some of it had been unsavory, I couldn’t recall anything that had been noticeably unpalatable. No cyanide capsules, no arsenic. Just *Beyond* this, plant-based that, Vegan-friendly and meat-free. Largely harmless stuff millions of people ate without issue every day.  \n\nWhen a knock sounded at the door, my first thought was that someone had heard my agonized shrieks and come to help. Wretchedly, I crawled from my kitchen to the foyer, leaving a disgusting trail of lumpy slime in my wake. Shuddering, having spent a considerable amount of energy in my deathly paroxysms, I pulled myself up and answered the door.  \n\nThere was a man standing there, wearing what appeared to be some kind of hazmat suit. The green, shimmering outfit was like an armor of reflective plastic, with the broad visor the only break in the visually disconcerting monotony. As if I’d called him, he silently nodded and walked past me into my home. He gave the trail of slime a wide berth as he entered my kitchen. Baffled – but also too delirious to try and stop him – I closed the door and followed him into the kitchen, lacking the energy to even vocally protest his unceremonious entry.  \n\nI entered to find him going through my fridge, occasionally setting items on the counter behind him. Feeling immensely woozy, and fearing that I’d again fall right onto my face, I headed over to the table and sat down. From here, I called out to him, asking with a vomit-roughed voice, “Who are you, and why are you going through my fridge?”  \n\nHe withdrew his head from the depths of my fridge and turned to me in a manner that seemed to say, *Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?*  \n\nWhen I simply stared in disbelief, he closed the fridge and came over to me, bearing a few items in hand. One by one he set them on the table as if they were prized possessions, like how a jeweler might set out an assortment of precious gems for a collector’s scrutiny. As my eyes languidly passed over the products, I finally realized that he’d been selecting all the plant-based, pseudo-meat products. With my mental clarity diminishing by the second, I only managed to mutter a, “What?” in response. Luckily, he understood my confusion and said, “Ah, I see. I am the first of my kind to have visited you. Well, I’ve come for your *plant meat.*”  \n\nThe way he worded it – and the apparent reverence with which he spoke – creeped me out. The unsettling nature of his speech also served to wake me up a bit, as the fine hairs on my body came to stand on end. I couldn’t exactly make out his face through the breath-enshrouded visor, but I could see his eyes, and they held a strange, frightful intensity in their gaze. The animal subroutines of my mind awoke from their dormancy, wanting to seize control and steer me away from the darkly eyed intruder. \n\nNot wanting to test a man who’d brazenly walk into someone’s home and plunder their fridge, I weakly motioned toward the items with a gesture that he could go ahead and take them. He nodded with boisterous gratitude, and began unwrapping one of the plant patties. Before I could tell him that he’d still need to cook it first, he loosened his hood at the neck, lifted it up to his mouth, and tossed the patty in. His chewing was loud, drawn out, and repulsing.  \n\nHe then spat the mouth-ground mess back onto the table.  \n\n“I tried to warn you, man.”  \n\nHis eyes flashed to me, and I recoiled in my chair at the acrid intensity in them.   \n\n“What is this?” His voice had deepened considerably, modulated by a sudden fury. As calmly as I could manage – fearing that the wrong response could bring about physical violence - I explained to him what he’d eaten, and how he probably should’ve cooked it first. As if only just then understanding, he picked up the packaging and read over the ingredients. He then did the same for the other, unopened items; and after closely examining these, he gave the others still in the fridge the same bizarre scrutiny.  \n\nAfter checking all that my friend had bought me, he came storming back to the table. He threw back his hood and I saw a face that couldn’t have been anything but artificial; the obvious expression thereon being rage, but oddly, uncannily articulated by misaligned – or simply absent – facial muscles. It was pale and glossy, slick with what I could only guess was sweat; as if he’d been burning up in the suit.  \n\nThat unnaturally ordered and curiously slimy face alone would’ve given me nightmares for weeks...*but then he just had to go and take it off.*  \n\nThe “face” beneath was just plain eldritch; somehow being outright monstrous despite having very little features and parts to it. There was depth, form, and color - gravestone grey - but not much else; and the texture....they say your tongue knows how any surface you look at might feel. And, in my disoriented and hunger-addled state, I found myself imagining what his inhuman face would taste like. \n\nAnd I retched, again and again.  \n\nHe spoke once more, and the manner in which he accomplished this was so abominable that I had to close my eyes in the middle of his question: “So you mean to tell me that these substances are artificially constructed? That they were neither born nor grown? But....manufactured?”  \n\nWith bile rising in my throat, I only managed a self-nauseating nod in affirmation.  \n\nAs if I had just told him some terrible, life-destroying news, he – mercifully – replaced his unwholesome face and pulled on his hood, with an air of deep, almost melodramatic sorrow. He glanced at the mess he’d left on the table and shook his head disappointedly. Terrified, but curious, I asked what he’d expected, and he solemnly responded:  \n\n**“This may come as a surprise to you: I hail not from Earth, but from the far-flung planets of an uncharted star system - unreachably remote by terrestrial means - whereon grew, in former cycles, the savory bounties of** ***xeno-flora*****; that's right - meat of t*****he seed and root.*** **But now, naught grows upon those desolate, unsunned spheres, for their local stars have long-since plunged into the very nadir of space; rendering the planets of that system cold and lifeless.  Now, I travel the cosmos, searching for that olden delicacy in other worlds. I thought I'd find it here, on this flourishing planet, where you have plant and animal life in abundance.**  \n\n**I sensed a great quantity of what I had hoped would be the meat-vegetation I desired, here in this home. I made gastro-contact, my stomach communing with yours. I’m sure you felt it, our bile-bonding. Anyway, I realize now that there is not a third option between the two; those two distinct forms of life have not successfully intermixed in this biosphere. Meat does not sprout from your soil; flesh does not drape from your trees. My search must continue. I must move on.”**  \n\nAnd with that, as briskly and brusquely as he’d entered, he left my home.  \n\nI fainted a few moments later. Unfortunately, the nerve-frying stench of sunbaked vomit aroused me from my impromptu rest. I closed the blinds to all the windows, washed my mouth out in the kitchen sink, and got started on cleaning up the mess I and *my guest* had left throughout the kitchen.  \n\nWhen my friend called to ask what I’d be having for the weekend, I told her I was ordering a pizza with as much meat as I could fit onto the order.",

        "text": "This story is based on an actual experience I had in March of 2022. Apologies in advance for spelling mistakes, dyslexia is a bitch.\n\nMarch: Loophead Peninsula, Co. Clare.\n\nHe stood on the precipice. The Wild Atlantic Ocean infront, the lighthouse of Loop Head behind. If he dove now and swam, he'd not see anything until the Eastern shores of North America. \n\nThis was what he lived for, wilderness, isolation, adventure. The oneness with nature.\n\nNone of this interested him in that moment. His gaze was fixed on the towering sea stack infront of him.\n\nHe could not see the ocean between the two lots of land. But could hear its waves of fury crashing against the rocks, several hundred feet below.\n\nLovers Rock they called it.\n\nHis mind wandered back to his grandfather's tales of Diarmuid and Gráinne. The tale of the two lovers who had spent a long night on the rock. Braving the elements together. Fleeing from Gráinne' ageing chieftan Finn McCumhil. Her bethrode.\n\nHe thought of his own love, still sat in his car. Protected from the elements that the West of Ireland was throwing at them. He wondered would she ever spend a night in the cold with him. Braving the rage of the Atlantic. Was it real love they had?\n\nThis was the last day of their staycation, their last stop before heading back to the bustling streets of Dublin. She had been consumed with worry for her ailing uncle since they had left the capital. It had put a dampner on his relaxation time. \n\nThen it hit him. Rising from between the sea stack and the mainland like a vengeful gust of wind. The howl. A shriek that brought shivers to his spine and pimples to his flesh. \n\nBarn Owl? Too early! A fox perhaps? But where? There was no cover in the form of trees or bushes to be seen. He had glimpsed no other signs of life on his venture to the stack. Loop Head was beautiful but this was the West of Ireland in March. Bleak, cold and forgotten. He was the only one there.\n\nHis mind went to another of his grandfather's stories, of the great warrior Cúchullain. To the mythical warriors bout with the hag Mál. Mál who had met her doom falling from the stack in pursuit of Cúchullain. Her body washing ashore at Hags Head near the Cliffs Of Moher. Her blood staining the beaches of Miltown Malby. \n\nStories he told himself. Stories from a time when people had time to create stories. \n\nThen it came again, rising and boiling over the precipice like an angry teapot. He left this plain and disappeared into his thoughts. \"She's come for me.\"\n\nHis senses and motor skills abandoned him. As much as he wanted to turn and run he could not.\n\nThe crashing waves of the Atlantic were gone. The sounds of the squabbling water fowl a distant memory. Her call was luring him from his astral body. He closed his eyes and accepted his faith...\n\nHe couldn't remember taking any steps, but when he returned to himself, it was evident by the sight of the roiling ocean calling up to him that he had. The world was silent. A light breeze took his cheek and blew his hair across his face. He breathed in deeply as if he had not tasted fresh air in years. \n\nA sigh of relief? He couldn't say for sure. The thought was on the tip of his tongue, but they were just stories. Stories from a time when people had time to create stories. \n\nWhen he felt confident in himself to walk again, he made his way back to his awaiting love. Daring not to look behind him. He had seen enough for one day and was full of fear, as to who or what may be looking back at him.\n\n\"Just stories!\" He told himself.\n\nShe was visibly upset. One hand lightly clutching the back of her head. The other loosely holding a cigarette burned to its butt. Her phone thrown into the drivers seat. Dried tears on her red cheeks. \"Her uncle!\" he remembered. \"She wasn't calling to me!\" He rejoiced to himself.\n\nHis face must have given his sudden realisation of the events of the past few moments. \"What is it?\" she asked.\n\nHe looked at her and said:\n\n\"Banshee...\"\n\nThanks for reading. I hope you all have a fun and safe Paddys Day.\n\nLá Fhéile Pádraig Sona Duit. 🇮🇪💚☘️",

        "author": "theelfatsolitude",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11tm6yb/desert_camping_almost_gone_wrong/",
        "text": "So let me start by saying that this is a real story: My brother and I are extremely experienced desert campers and we have lived near deserts pretty much our whole lives. I have never in my 20 years of life ever for one second believed in anything paranormal or anything to do with evil spirits, unlike my brother who has always sensed presenses and been able to see mostly what we call djinn also know as demons, until last night which is safe to mark as the last time we will be camping alone in the desert. \n\nWe always have the same place we like to go when we want to camp with minimum effort and our day started as normal as ever but as we got closer and closer to our destination I saw my brother's mood completely shift aand when I asked what was wrong he just shrugged me off and told me to just keep driving. When we arrived I felt completely fine but my brother was still unusually quiet (it was around 1pm at that point and we were planning on leaving at around 12-1 am. Because of the heat we made the terrible decision to setup unnder a few trees and a source of water, which in Middle Eastern culture is where the djinns live at night, not that I believed that at the time of course) however we still setup our camp and continued on as normal.\n\n Now my brother always says that when he feels a presence (or several in this case) he gets extremely unlucky... First he almost dropped a box of coals on his foot, then he spilt an entire bottle of coke on his phone, then he dropped it into the sand then proceeded to smash his elbow on the edge if the chair he was sitting on (which is now very swollen) and last but certainly not least when he was looking through one of our boxes he felt something cold and sharp press right against his arm and he realised it was an unsheathed knife (which we packed with its case the previous night before and he later said it felt like something pushed his hand into it, right were his veins are). All of these events consecutively within a matter of a few hours was certainly making us both uneasy and I for the life of me couldn't figure out why he was suddenly so unlucky.\n\nAs I was staring to question his clumsyness a random couple appeared out of nowhere informing us that they were stuck in the sand an needed help (we drive a land cruiser and they had a Nissan Altima so we didn't expect to encounter as many issues as we did). We first dug them out without any issues but as we pushed them out of the sand but the got stuck again. If you know anything about dune bashing or desert camping then you understand the physics behind how wheels get stuck in sand and the way this nissan was stuck was incredibly unusual, it was literally stuck somewhere with plenty of space available for grip (and later in my brother said that as we were digging them out of the sand, thats when he really started feeling an evil presence around us but didn't want to say anything as to not ruin the trip and freak me out) so we ended up having to tow them out of the sand, which again was far harder than it had to be, first our tow strap broke off of their bumber (toe strap cost 200 dollars and was fine but their bumper was slightly damaged) then we almost got stuck ourselves and a 20 minute job took more like 90 (which again was extremely unusual and with hindsight just the beginning of all the crap to come).\n\n When we came back to our camp we noticed how everything around us had gotten unusually quiet, the area we were in has hundreds of birds around and as far as we have seen 3 cats who sometimes pay us a visit, but there wasn't a single noise at all other than our fire (which was dying out unusually quickly). It gad gotten dark quickly so we had scrambled to build a fire to cook our dinner before we were asked to help the couple and I had noticed the silence but it didn't bother me however my brother suddenly grabbed my hand as we were sitting down to eat and said with clear fear in his voice that was should go as quickly as possible and that he didn't feel safe, to ease both our minds we prayed (we are Christian so of course we thought it would help us) but I think it accelerated everything that happened and just made whatever was there with us angry. \n\nWe quickly finished our dinner (and me being the skeptic I was completely fine and pretty much just humouring my brother) util I started getting the nagging feeling that it was time to pack up and leave, it hit me like a wave and I was quite taken a back by the feeling so I voiced it to my brother and he agreed that we should pack up right away and leave. We started packing up (at a normal pace like we were just tired and wanted to leave) and that when we heard a sound very close to us, on the opposite side of the pond which wasn't that big, that I could only describe as the sound of death itself and it seemed to go on for several minutes and when I say that we looked at each other in absolute fear I genuinely mean I was ready to have a heart attack right there and then. At that point, after being forzen for a few minutes and quite reasonably so after hearing that bellowing screech so close to us, we turned on the car, drove it back so we could see better with the headlamps and just started throwing everything into the car without much care but with a whole lot of urgency...and it was like after the screaming thats when shit really hit the fan. \n\nFirst it was the sound of twigs snapping and footsteps all around us, then it was the shadows behind the trees and I tried everything to try and get those shadows to change shape, walking around the trees and moving the lights but nothing it looked like there were people just staring at us the whole time and you could really feel it too, we really felt like we weren't alone and that we weren't with friendly entities either. We also noticed that all 3 cats were huddled  right behind our car (away from the trees so they were not the ones snapping twigs) but literally did not care if they were not going to move I was still getting out if there (thankfully they left when we started reversing) but they too looked absolutely terrified and were just starting at the trees too. It also felt like whatever was there was getting closer (and I have never felt anything like it, it was a gut feeling and you just know its one of those natural instinct you should not ignore). Thankfully we were able to pack up quickly (our tent was very close to the trees though so that was a nerve wracking experience) and whilst we are packing it is still very silent (its very normal for the birds around that area to continue making sounds until 2 or 3 am) and at this point it was about 8pm so it was highly unusual.\n\n I personally think I was most terrifying as I was driving away back onto the main dirt path to leave the desert (I know cars very well, I know how they drive in the sand and I know our car especially well because weve had it for so long and I could instantly tell that the steering was off and  completely fighting against me which fixed itself the second we were on the highway) , the sound of twigs snapping was still all around us and it was loud enough to be heard over the sounds of the car and on the path was what seemed like every bird that was in the area, just standing there and staring at us until we got close enough to force them to walk (not even fly) away. At one point my brother just grabbed me shoulder and told me very sternly to just keep looking in front of me and under no circumstances to look through his window (it was the tone of his voice that told me to listen to him for the love of god). We were in a part of the desert where we had to pretty much drive through the whole of the accessible areas to get onto the highway and there wasn't a single person around us, the only thing we saw was a very clearly abandoned toyota hylux positioned behind a small dune and hidden by the trees but was far enough from our campsite to easily be ruled out as the source of the original screech. The worst thing I saw was as we were closing to the exit (now we know these deserts very well, we've both grown up here and have been riding dirt bikes and quad bikes in these deserts since we moved here and we know what wild life to expect, cats, birds, spiders, goats, camels, mice, foxes maybe even the occasional scorpio or if you are really unlucky a snake but that is it, there is nothing else in these deserts) we saw standing in the middle of the path, staring directly at us, a deer...a god damn deer (Ive only ever seen 1 deer in 16 hears of living here and that was in someone's garden as a pet). Its safe to say I was in complete shock, and the deer was just not moving at all until I got close enough that we could practically smell the thing before it slowly walked off the path whilst looking right at us. We quickly moved past the deer and again my brother, with a gasp and then very sternly, said to keep my eyes right in the road (I asked him as we got on the highway what it was that he kept seeing and he very reluctantly told me he kept seeing large figures around us anytime we went through a bend and they were all either pointing right as us or ahead of us...Im very glad he didn't tell me at the time cus I would have been shitting mysel). We still were yet to encounter anyone but we still very clearly heard sounds all around us (and again not the usual bird or cat but very clearly big and unrelenting). When I saw the exit I was as happy as I have ever been but that quickly fade when once again we saw another deer standing right in the middle of the road slowly waking away and looking right at us except this time it didn't really look like a deer more like a kangaroo mixed with a deer and its eyes were milky and it looked rotten and horrible, but I didn't much care I just stepped on the gas and fortunately it had gotten out if the way in time.\n\n Now when you exit the desert you can either turn right onto a long stretch of highway or you can go left and go through a small town then take the back streets to a parallel highway and as I was about to turn right my brother once again, with that same tone if voice, said to go to the town and go to the right (later he once again said he saw a line of figures pointing ahead of us so if we would have gone that way we wouldn't have made it home in one piece). Thankfully as we made it farther and farther awayy and close to our home the gut feeling of being watched was going away and of course having never experienced something like this before I was distraught and wanted to talk about it. My brother told me as we were going home that because we were alone the djinn wanted to mess with us, that they wanted to scare us and most likely cause us harm and that the way they get to you in such rural places is to force you to stop and then do whatever they want (which make sense as to why there were so many animals on our path). He also said that they cause bad luck and he could feel them the second we entered the desert (which explains his clumsyness all day and the car that got stuck in such an unusual manner). This is also my younger brother (by 3 years) and naturally any time he ever told me about this sort of thing I always just dismissed it as him scaring himself... \n\nI can excuse the sounds we heard and shadows we saw last night, I can excuse the gut feeling as just being scared but I cannot excuse the 2 deer we saw staring right at us and I cannot excuse the car just randomly fighting against me as I was driving. The deer completely freaked me out as did the tone of my brother's voice (Im also sorry if this us written sporadically, Im still shaken up and trying to make sense of everything) and its safe to say we are not going camping there again and its safe to say Im never dismissing my brother when jt comes to this kind if thing again and god am I so thankful that we made it home safely.\n\nEdit: I also forgot to mention that as we were setting up our tent it was fighting us, we would secure one end of it into the ground and instantly another end would pop out and after we finally managed to get it set up it looked as if something was pushing it in and it collapsed once before we got it back up and again it looked like something was pushing on it which is something neither of us have ever experienced before and we have set up tents in the middle of a sand storm before",

        "text": "Whenever this time of year comes around, my night terrors resurge. Quaking in my blackened bedroom, I eye the ceiling and reflect on my youth. One particular memory. A revolting recollection of a trauma I cannot repress.\n\nMothering Sunday.\n\nWhat does that day mean to you? For most, it’s a day of celebration. I suppose my village also celebrated that annual holiday, but we did so differently.\n\nI abandoned my hometown long ago, but my freedom came at a cost. The village had no real name, but we called it The Valley. It was severed from the rest of the world by lush hills and an unholy force that deterred visitors.\n\n“See the hills at the border, Marlene?” My brother asked, pointing.\n\nI nodded. “I wanna know what’s past ‘em, Harry.”\n\nMy older brother tussled my unkempt, curly, blonde locks of hair. “Something better than this, kid. Come on. Mum’s waiting.”\n\n“Which one?” I timidly queried.\n\nHarry frowned. “*Our* mother, Marlene.”\n\nMother’s Day, 2004. The day I try to forget. I was only nine years old. Harry was either eighteen or nineteen at the time, and he assumed the role of a father figure — that responsibility must’ve weighed heavily on his shoulders. I never met my real dad, but Harry told me that he wasn’t a good man.\n\nAs the midday sun beat against the tarmac, scorching my shoeless feet, my brother and I sprinted through our idyllic town. We passed townsfolk in white garbs, dressed for the Mothering Sunday Festival. They smiled pleasantly at us, but it was false pleasantry. Every year, on that day, a shadow hung over the town. Friends and families were bewitched by Mother.\n\n*The* Mother.\n\nPriest Hanson told me that ‘Mother’ was simply The Valley’s symbol for nature itself, but I knew he was only saying that to still my anxious thoughts. Mother was real. Not human, but real. She lived in the rocky cliffside at one edge of town. Children would dare each other to enter the mouth of her cave, but nobody could. An unseen force stopped us.\n\n“Make sure you tend to Lucy,” Harry said.\n\nI sighed and walked around the side of our house, heading to the stable to feed Lucy. She was our ploughing horse on the farm, but we sometimes used her as town transport. We didn’t have modern technology in The Valley. Our village was trapped in a bubble of time. There was a rusty husk of a car on my neighbour’s driveway that had belonged to his grandfather — from the days before Mother, when townsfolk could travel beyond the hills. She must’ve arrived at some point in the twentieth century.\n\nMum — my *real* one — emerged from the back door of our house and smiled at me. She looked as crooked as every other villager on Mothering Sunday, but there was a shimmering tear in the corner of her eye, as if her lips were being paranormally puppeteered into that ghastly grin. It was as if my real mother were hiding behind that horrible face.\n\n“Are you excited for the parade, sweetheart?” Mum asked.\n\nI buried my head in Lucy’s neck. “Can’t we just celebrate with you at home, Mum?”\n\nShe tutted, striding over to me. “*Shame*, Marlene! All in The Valley must honour Mother on this sacred day.”\n\n“But you’re my mother,” I said.\n\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, she slapped me across the cheek. I shrieked and looked into my mum’s eyes. They had widened, and her lips were quivering. She wasn’t in control of her body. Not on that cursed day. I knew that.\n\n“Help your brother with the food,” She ordered.\n\nMassaging my stinging cheek, I scurried past my mum and only allowed myself the luxury of crying once I’d entered the house. I called for Harry.\n\n“What’s wrong?” My brother asked, appearing at the top of the stairs.\n\n“Mum hit me,” I whimpered.\n\nHarry smiled for a second, then he shook his head, as if to ward off the demon that possessed him. He had finally come of age, and I think Mother’s spell only worked on the adults in town. Children seemed to hate the festival. No, it was worse than hate.\n\nWe *feared* it.\n\n“You’re not wearing your dress,” Harry said. “Quickly! We have to bring the food to the market by one o’clock.”\n\nI begrudgingly rushed upstairs, choosing to ignore the sinister expression I’d glimpsed on my brother’s face. Hanging on my bedroom door was a ghastly white dress — something a ghoul in a haunted house would wear. But I wore it, as I was frightened of incurring Mum’s wrath, and I helped my brother carry boxes of fruit and vegetables out of the house.\n\nWe joined a procession of excitably chattering people. Everybody moved towards the heart of the village, gathering in the grassy town square. Bunting hung from all six corners of the centric gazebo, stretching out towards Victorian lampposts.\n\n“Mother knows best,” The crowd sang in unison.\n\nI joined some of my school friends, and we meekly joined the choral chanting. It wasn’t much of a song. Just those same three words, repeatedly tirelessly in a dissonant, disjointed melody. As I talked to Brandon, one of my closest friends, about the weirdness of the festival, his mum rushed over to us.\n\n“Happy Mother’s Day, Marlene!” She jubilantly cried.\n\nI feigned a smile. “Happy Mother’s Day, Mrs May.”\n\n“You and Brandon would be a *heavenly* coupling. Have you considered my proposal?” She gleefully asked.\n\nI gulped. “Erm…”\n\n“Not now, Mum,” Brandon grumbled.\n\n“Nothing godly about pickiness, Brandon,” His mum scorned. “The next seven years will fly by. Sixteen is an important age. Do you want another boy to marry sweet little Marlene Smith? Hmm? We all serve the circle of life. Mother’s circle.”\n\nThankfully, Priest Hanson scooted Mrs May away. Brandon instantly shot a mortified look at me.\n\n“Marlene, I-” He began.\n\n“It’s fine,” I awkwardly giggled. “My mum’s worse.”\n\n“All of our parents are terrible on this day,” Tia, our other friend, sighed. “Maybe it has something to do with *The Choosing*.”\n\n“Shhh!” Brandon sharply warned. “They chose Zach’s mum last year, and he’s coming over now.”\n\nZach, bleakly hanging his head, was shooed over to us by his eerily chipper father. The boy hadn’t spoken much at school over the past year.\n\n“Hello, everyone,” He mumbled.\n\n“Hi, Zach,” I said. “How are you?”\n\nHe sniffled, wiping away a tear with the sleeve of his jacket. “Dad wouldn’t let me stay at home.”\n\n“To *heck* with this day!” Brandon whispered.\n\nWe all quietly snickered at Brandon’s comment — outrageous in our childish minds. We felt like outsiders, free of the hive mind. Free of Mother.\n\nMayor Finley suddenly interrupted our conversation. “Put your hands together for the mothers of The Valley!”\n\nHe welcomed a procession of mothers — a hundred, I’d say — onto a large wooden platform beside the gazebo. The villagers applauded the mothers, clapping so loudly that I thought their palms might blister. Harry walked over and put his arm around me.\n\n“It’s going to be okay,” He promised.\n\nWe watched Mum, donning the same white dress as every woman on the stage, join the line-up of mothers.\n\n“Congratulations to those of you who gave birth this year. You have the immense privilege of being nominated for *The Choosing*. Old and new, all mothers are honoured on this sacred day,” The mayor stated. “But we are all children of *the* Mother.”\n\n“Mother knows best,” The grownups chanted.\n\n“Yes. She gives, and we take,” The mayor sighed. “We are not worthy, which is why, every year, we must honour her on this holy day. We must feed her maternalism, so her boundless love does not wane. A mother must be sacrificed to Mother.”\n\n“Y’know, I heard that little Johnny tried to run away last week,” Tia whispered to me. “He passed out before the hills, of course.”\n\n“Nobody ever makes it past the hills,” Brandon gulped.\n\nMr Johnson, a local shopkeeper, shushed us, and he wore the same sickening look of unwavering adoration as every other adult.\n\n“*The Choosing* is a fair process,” The mayor said. “I will draw a name, and Mother shall have her offering.”\n\nThe villagers waited in complete silence for Mayor Finley to pluck a name from a worn hat. He produced a small slip of paper, unfolded it, and nodded his head.\n\n“Juliet Smith,” He announced.\n\nAs a roar of joy erupted in the crowd, my friends looked at my blood-drained face. Harry clutched me tightly as I started to wail inconsolably.\n\n“Not Mum!” I cried. “Harry, don’t let them take her!”\n\nBut when I looked up at my brother, he was smiling. There were tears in his eyes, revealing his true emotions, but his face told a different story — the demented look of joy filled me with horror, as did his absent-minded eyes, which locked onto mine.\n\n“Mother knows best,” Harry said, grinning.\n\nBrandon restrained me as I tried to run towards my mum, but I never would’ve reached her. The crowd of celebrating villagers lifted her into the air. Harry joined them. Seeing him robotically merge with the herd instilled me with sorrow and terror in equal measure.\n\nOnly my childhood friends retained their humanity. Only *we* were spared the influence of Mother’s captivating spell. We followed the crowd along a series of streets, over the ravine, and towards the cliff side — stopping before the lightless hovel in which Mother was said to live.\n\n“The witch’s cave,” Tia whispered.\n\nBrandon thumped her on the arm. “Stop it!”\n\nZach, the only one who understood my pain, placed a sympathising hand on my shoulder. “I’m sorry, Marlene. I’m… I’m so sorry.”\n\nI didn’t utter a word. I simply watched as my mother was delicately lowered by the crowd at the mouth of the cave. She didn’t say goodbye to Harry or me. She simply joined the chanting of the hypnotised townsfolk as she vanished into the darkness.\n\n“Mother knows best.”\n\nThe crowd quickly dissipated. An hour or so later, my friends also left. Brandon stayed with me until the sun started to set.\n\n“I can’t stay any later,” He apologised. “My mum would kill me. If you want to stay at my house-”\n\n“- I’ll be fine,” I coldly interrupted.\n\nAs night blanketed me, I watched the cave with teary eyes. And then the most terrible thing happened. I heard my mother’s voice. Her scream echoed from the depths of the cavernous pit, but it was the following noises which would haunt my dreams for years to come.\n\nCrunching. Squelching. Snapping.\n\nAnd something else.\n\n“I see you.”\n\nI screeched. The ghastly whisper seeped directly into my ear, but I twisted my head to find nobody there. It had been a woman’s hoarse voice, but it didn’t sound human — or earthly, for that matter. It was Mother. I knew it. And when I turned back to the cave entrance, I saw something which horrified me.\n\nA pair of eyes in the black void. Two white spheres with faded, yellowing pupils. I screamed again, but Mother quickly shushed me.\n\n“Run along now,” She whispered. “Mother’s eating.”\n\nI screeched most of the way home, stopping only when my voice box finally failed me. And when I entered our home, I found my brother sitting at the kitchen table in the darkness. I lit a candle, illuminating his horribly-smiling face. But there were tears streaming down his cheeks.\n\n“Harry…” I cried. “Mum’s gone.”\n\nHe quietly looked up at me, smile painting his shivering face, and tapped his finger on a piece of paper. He was wrestling with Mother’s control, striving to tell me something. I walked over to the table and read the words he had written.\n\n*Take Lucy beyond the hills. Tie yourself to her reins. She won’t faint.*\n\n“I won’t go without you,” I cried.\n\nMy brother tapped more furiously on the paper. His grin seemed to grow more sinisterly jaunty by the second, proving the point he was trying to make — he belonged to Mother. It was too late for him, but it wasn’t too late for me.\n\nI ran to each of my friend’s houses, telling them my plan. One by one, horrifyingly, they refused me. Even Brandon. And he said something I’ll never forget.\n\n“Oh, Marlene. The grass isn’t greener beyond the hills. *Mother knows best*.”\n\nAnd when he seized my wrist, I realised something. None of us were safe from Mother’s spell. Not really. Age meant nothing. I wrenched myself free of my friend’s grip, darted home, and hurriedly strapped myself to Lucy’s back.\n\n“Right, girl,” I said. “I’m going to black out when we reach the hills, but I need you to keep trotting, okay? Just take me away from here. I hope Harry’s right about this. Don’t faint. Please.”\n\nAnd as Lucy trotted along the road out of the village, I felt my eyesight falter. The colours of my surroundings seemed to merge together. The moon swirled, dividing into two beaming orbs that reminded me of Mother’s eyes. She was watching me, and I attempted to scream as the world faded to black.\n\nWhen I woke, I was lying on Lucy’s back, and we were somewhere unrecognisable. Somewhere foreign and futuristic. Shiny cars sat on driveways, and the dawning sun illuminated modern shopfronts. Police officers were keen to question the girl who had entered their quiet, country village on the back of a horse, but I never spoke about what happened.\n\nI ended up in an orphanage, enduring years of counselling, and I eventually adapted to the modern world. I understand why The Valley has been forgotten by outsiders. Mother keeps people away. She plays mind games. But she doesn’t need to use spells to keep me away. I hope she’s forgotten about me.\n\nStill, sometimes, when the moon is particularly bright, I truly believe that I catch glimpses of her eyes.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "\"RODGER!\" I yelled to my boss, he had his cockatoo  Hulkasaurus Rex, on his shoulder. He was playing tiktoks to keep him entertained on his break. Funny little sight in this world of death we live in, helps make the days easier seeing this feathered little shit sometimes. He's singing \"the cheese tax, *squeak\" bobbing his head, and tapping his tiny claws. Rodger is stuck in a thousand yard stare. \n\"RODGERMCFUCKFACE!!!!!\" I loudly say to him, usually snaps him out of it. \n\n\"What Hellinger?\" He said half dazed, rubbing his eye that is scarred over on the left side. \n\"I need help moving these bodies to the meat lockers. We have 6 from that Appalachian hiker incident that just came in.\" I was clearly annoyed, I only have so many arms, and Rodgers son Xavier was out \"sick\" today. He was never sick, probably snorting pixie dust again, it is payday after all. \n\"You know they're calling these 'bear' attacks right? Made a whole show of it on the news how they 'caught' and 'handled' the 'bear'. We know it's not bears in those damned mountains. It's fucking Saratoga NY all over again. 'Cept the rich folks there pay to keep everyone quiet. Don't wanna mess up their perfect tourism.\" He put Hulk in his enclosure, when I noticed a lump on one of his claws. \n\"Hey Rodge, what's that?\" I say pointing to the birds claw with curiosity. \"Aw shit, he's got bumblefoot. It's like a blackhead in the birds claw, can get real nasty like a cyst if you don't take it out.\" He gets a bit tense. Despite having his son, Hulk is his real baby. \"Can we take it out? Do we have what he needs here?\" He looks at me like I sprouted 3 heads. \"Girly, I'm all thumbs. I may be the boss here. But even with your dexterity we need a vet for this. I'll help you get the bodies in the freezer. But I need ya to hold the fort down til I get back. Don't open the door for nobody, no matter what ya hear. Stay in the office and do the paperwork, the bodies are fine until we come back in the morning capiche?\" I agreed and helped him load everything he needed in His truck, then went back to the office to start filling out the mound of paperwork we have to do to confirm transfer of remains. I had to have been on the third bodies paperwork when I heard the door open, \"the cheeeese tax, the cheeeeeeeese tax\" a raspy weird voice repeats twice. \n\"Ayo, Hulk, Rodger. You guys back already? That was quick!\" \n\"The cheeeeeese tax, the cheese tax!\" It sounded insistent, no way in Sam hell that came from a bird. \"Xavier,  get your high ass home! I have no time for your antics tonight!\" He had done dumb shit when he got pixie dust before. I wasn't even looking up from my paperwork to entertain his stupid self. I wanted to go home the second bossman walked through that door. \n\"THE CHEEESE TAX, THE CHEEEEEEESE TAX\" The voice was deeper, more sinister.  Then a squeaking noise, like something being smeared across glass with too much force. \nI snap back. \"XAVIER! I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING HOLY!\" I stop as I look up. Not entirely sure what I was even seeing. \n\n\"Yessss, the cheese tax. I am owed. The other human pays the cheese tax. Where is the other human?\"\nDon't ask me where the courage to answer came from, \"his bird is sick. He took it to an animal doctor.\"\nIt turned its head at an unnatural angle. \n\"You give me cheese tax then small human. I am owed.\" It elongated the last word, for emphasis I'm sure. \n\"What is the cheese tax?\" I ask, having no damned idea what it was referencing. It points at the door, the door to the room where we store bodies. My eyes go wide, it nods at me as if to say, \"you understand now\"\n\n\"What cheese tax do you want?\" \n\n\"The onessss in the shiny boxes\" \n\n\"Will you hurt me if I give you the cheese tax?\"\n\n\"The cheese tax, the human says cheese tax is how I ask for this. Give me CHEESE TAX!\" Cleary agitated. I didn't know what it was, and I didn't want it eating me. I got up and headed for the door to open it. The doors open in such a way it makes a clear corridor while blocking the office from the transportation area like a divider. I figure, I do this. It goes in and grabs what it wants, and leaves.\n\nThe second the doors are connected, the sound of its claws dashing on hard tiles is so fast I didn't have time to blink. I swallow my fear. Something tells me to not display myself as prey to this being. \n\"THE CHEESE TAX!\" It sounds anxious in the room. \"COME HUMAN OPEN CHEESE TAX!\" It says in a raspy voice of a mouth with too many teeth.\nI swiftly enter the room and ask, \"which ones? Trying to be non chalant at this massively tall creature that looks like a nightmare. I know what it is. A damned WENDIGO. \"Which ones?\" I ask politely again, now knowing the full extent of the danger I am in if I do not comply with it's demands. It looks at me as well, as if to consider me. For what, I can only hope it's not food. It's elongated claws pick 4 drawers. I open each one, and pull out the cadavers so it doesn't damage the equipment.  We can always blame missing bodies on thieves. You try explaining how steel got bent like an aluminum can to the higher ups. We also live in a small town of otherwise weirdos. Nobody asks too many questions here. \n\"Can I get you anything else?\" I ask as nicely as I can. \n\"Thaank you human, you are not food.\" I took that as my cue to leave the room. I left the doors open so it could leave when it wanted. I sat down, popped in my earpods, and texted Rodger. \n\"I never want to hear the song 'the cheese tax' ever again in my fucking life.\" These earpods suck, I hear it slurping, gnawing, gnashing. For hours. It leaves just before dawn. I go to check the damage. Spotless. Like it was never there, never pegged Wendigos for being clean guests.",

        "text": " I feel like I lost my mind completely a month or two ago. It was around 8pm. I was just getting off work and was ready to head over to my friends house. His name is Harry and we are still good friends, but this man doesn’t believe a word I told him about this night. I got in my car and started it, plugged my phone into aux, turned on music, then heat. It was cold as hell. As I was sitting there in my car, I looked out across the train tracks that cross the forest behind the shopping center. \n\n  I notice movement behind a tree. What looks like raccoon or fox or something jumps out quickly. From behind one tree it leaps seamlessly to the cover of the next until it’s too deep in the woods for my vision to follow. Hell nah. “Click” I lock the doors and wait another few moments for my engine to warm, then I am out. Things like that freak me out. Wild animals are uncontrollable and they follow their own agenda. Could that agenda have been to hunt me down and steal my garbage? Maybe, or it’s just alerting the rodent army that their target is sitting like a duck in her car waiting to be sacrificed to the entity. Probably not but I would rather leave than let my mind jump to more conclusions.  \n\n     Down the road a few miles I make a right and cross the tracks. Following the road that leads to Harry’s house always confuses me, especially at night. Mailboxes blend together and turns seem to lead you in circles. \n\nscratch\n\nMy vision focuses on the rear view mirror. No sticks on the road, something must have gotten caught under my car. I turn down my music. I still have a few miles to go, and the occasional scratch can be heard from under my car. I stop quickly in an area lit by a dim flickering street light. I get out of my car to check for sticks. Quickly I walk around my car to make sure nothing is stuck to the wheels. Nothing to be found. Nothing is under my car either. strange but not worth standing around in the cold for. I hop back in and close my car door. Most of the heat was let out by the open door from my little pit stop so I blast the warm air. Starting down the road again, I don’t hear anything but warm air blowing and joey badass. \n\nWhat I see in my mirror sends a cool shiver up my spine. \nA rodent of sorts. Tall, with a mans posture. Its peeking at me from over and behind my seat with glossy eyes. \n\nFrom there on out, my memory is foggy. One of Harry’s neighbors found me wrecked into a tree on the side of the road. I got a concussion and broken collar bone. The only sign of the creature was the back door left slightly open as though someone didn’t shut it hard enough.",

        "text": "Have you ever had a gut feeling?\n\nLike a visceral feeling that something isn't right. That you need to run? Well that feeling is our most basic instinct. It's almost spiritual to some. Heck, maybe it is religious, although at this point I'm not sure I've got a God to believe in.\n\nWhat's that old quote again? The uncanny Valley implies an evolutionary reason to be afraid of something that looks human, but isn't. It goes something like that. But heck, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet's go back to 2015 when this all started. I live out in the country. Whatever you think about living in the country it's probably wrong. I'm not racist and I have internet. Well my cousin Jhonny's pretty racist but we just don't invite him to any of our get togethers and things go alright.\n\nAnyways, I have 3 daughters: Scarlet, our oldest of the three, Jolynn, our youngest, and Laura, our middle daughter. We also have a son: Dan, but he moved out 10 years ago and it's living with his girlfriend Hannah. My wife's name is Dennise. That's my little family. We have a neighbor who lives quite a distance away. An elderly lady living alone. We like to invite her for walks when we can. Her name is Matilda. But I don't want to overload your mind, let's just focus on what I have to say, the rest will come when it needs to.\n\nWe hunt wild animals. A lot of you might not behoove our type still exist but we do. A lot of subsistence off the land. The hunting trip I took with Scarlett in August was the first where we also took Laura. I need to teach her how to shoot like everyone in my family leaned before her. Or at least to scare off weirdos in the woods. I've never encountered any feral people or anything but I've had my fair share of Bigfoot encounters. While city folk debate us out in the country we know that not taking them seriously could be dangerous and stupid. Me? I've seen one three times! But again, I'm going off topic. After what I have to tell you maybe Bigfoot won't seem so wild.\n\nOn our expedition Scarlett scored a deer and took it back home herself. I stayed to see if Laura could get us a rabbit to have some stew. Denise makes a mean rabbit stew.\n\nI saw a flash of white and showed her how to track it without being noticed. We made sure we were down wind and I got her to point the gun at the lump of fur. The lump of fur... Fur. Where was it's fur? It was white but that must've been its skin. I couldn't identify it so I told Laura to wait. I stared at it for what must've been a minute before it turned to look at me. It had the most deformed face I'd ever seen. The nose was on its forehead. Its mouth was on both sides of its face with way too many sharp teeth. This wasn't some new animal. It had to be some inbred.. Something! I didn't like the looks of it anyways so I grabbed Laura and ran. I don't think she had her gun with her anymore but at least I still had mine if things got hairy, I heard it screaming at us and dashing through the woods on its... Hands? Were those hands? No it couldn't be. But it didn't look like anything else. Strange. We were coming upon the house and I saw Scarlett drag the deer into the shed. I yelled at her \"GET INSIDE NOW!\"\n\nWe shut the door and locked it. I peered outside but it was gone. We were safe. That damned thing better not come back. Maybe that thought was too hopeful, I thought it was pretty reasonable. We didn't go hunting for a few days after that. We had enough of Scarlett's deer and some leftovers. Denise went to make something-a-rather from the deer hide but when she went to get it the thing had gone from the shed. She came in and told me about this. We were both tough as nails and spoke about it calmly. I told her it was probably a predator but for the first time in my life I saw something I'd never seen in her eyes. She said it wasn't a predator, at least not one we'd seen. There was no blood or forced entry, the key was in the lock to the shed and the whole carcass had disappeared. She was right about the fact that something wasn't right. This isn't just an unusual occurrence, it was impossible. The key to the shed was inside the toolbox on our front porch.\n\nI decided we wouldn't go outside. The kids would play inside and I would get the truck and buy groceries in town. Out here children don't really play inside but at least we had a Wii that was regifted. I'm not sure it worked but we could pretend it did. When I got back with my groceries I decided with the strange shed happenings and that weird inbred bunny I would check on our neighbor Matilda. I walked over and knocked on the door. I didn't get a response. Afraid the old lady had fallen over I knocked again more frantic and I didn't wait for an answer. I jimmyed the window open and entered the home. \"Miss Matilda! Are you alright!?\" Silence. I searched the whole house up and down but found nothing. Well not nothing. There was a pot still on. It was boiling and had a wooden spoon melting into it. I turned it off and left Matilda a note to call me when she gets back.\n\nI realized I forgot to check the bedroom and decided to give it a quick look over. As I approached I heard a noise through the open window to my right. It was a strange gargle noise. I slowly approached the window trying to identify the sound.a \nI would have run thinking it's Matilda but something wasn't right. I peered out the window and saw a white figure crouched over. It turned to me and I noticed it was the same one as before. It's mouth morphed to the middle of its face and I heard it say through gargles: \"Get inside now! Get inside now!\" I froze. I should have left. I should have gone home and burned the forest down or something. But I froze. I eventually broke my trance and ran out the door and all the way home. As I was leaving though I heard behind me in the house \"It's probably just a predator.\"\n\nWhen I got home I boarded up the windows. Denise didn't say a word about it. I think we were all stressed. What none of us expected was the doorbell. I approached cautiously and saw, of all things, Matilda through the window. I unlocked and opened the door and greeted her asking about her absence when the pot was running. She just said \"Oh I become so forgetful in my old age.\" I asked where she was and she said she was on a walk. \"Ok, well what brings you over?\" Matilda says \"I wanted to call but your note worried me, I was wondering if you'd have me for a few nights. We agreed and Scarlett took the couch. We lived together and helped each other for about a week. We tried to further the strange occurrences but knew deep down it would be wise to keep it in the back of our minds. I asked Jolynn if she wanted spaghetti and she said \"YES YES!! SPAGHETER!\" I laughed and began cooking. The pot reminded me of Matilda. It's all well and good to be forgetful but the spoon was still in. It bugged me. Why was the spoon still in? That's when I heard a crash from Scarlett's room(currently Matilda's). I ran over and saw her lying on the floor pointing at the window in terror. I saw the old creature again smiling at her. I grabbed Matilda and shut the door. The family gathered in the main room as we began to hear scratching at our front door. I grabbed my shot gun and we huddled together. I reassured everyone: \"so long as the door is closed and locked it can't get through.\" Well that's what I thought until I stared at a horrifying sight. Matilda got up and began to open the door...",

        "text": " The neighborhood was normally a quiet and peaceful place, but lately, there had been something strange happening. People had reported seeing a tall, skinny figure lurking around the streets at night. It was as tall as a house and had long, spindly arms that seemed to stretch out into the darkness. \n\nNo one knew what the figure was or where it had come from, but everyone was afraid of it. Parents warned their children not to go out after dark, and people stayed locked inside their homes once the sun had set. \n\nBut one night, a group of teenagers decided to investigate. They armed themselves with flashlights and baseball bats, and they set out into the darkness. \n\nThe streets were deserted, and there was no sign of the shadowy figure. But as they turned a corner, they saw it. The figure was standing in the middle of the street, its long arms stretching out as if it was reaching into the night itself. \n\nThe teenagers were confused and frightened. What was this thing? Was it a ghost? A demon? Something else entirely? \n\nThey decided to follow the figure, to see where it went and what it was doing. They crept behind it, staying out of sight. \n\nAs they followed it, they noticed something strange. The figure wasn't just wandering aimlessly. It seemed to be searching for something. It would pause at certain houses, as if it was looking for someone specific. \n\nThe teenagers watched as the figure disappeared into one of the houses. They waited for a few minutes, then cautiously approached the house. \n\nInside, they found an old woman. She was sitting in a rocking chair, staring off into space. They tapped on the window and startled her.  They asked her if she knew anything about the shadowy figure, she nodded slowly. \n\n\"I've seen it,\" she said. \"It's been coming around here for years. I don't know what it wants, but it's looking for something.\" The teenagers were confused. What could the figure be looking for? And why was it so important?   \n\n\nThey decided to investigate further. They spent the next few nights following the figure, trying to figure out what it was doing. They watched as it searched through garbage cans, peered into windows, and even climbed onto rooftops.   \n\n\nAs they discussed the possibilities of what it could be looking for, the teenagers stood frozen in fear as the shadowy figure seemed to come out of nowhere and towered over them. Its long, thin limbs stretched out, reaching for them like tendrils from a nightmare. \n\n\"What is that thing?\" one of them whispered. \n\n\"I don't know,\" another replied. \"But we have to do something.\" \n\nThe figure had been stalking the neighborhood for weeks, appearing at night and disappearing before anyone could get a good look at it. But now it was here, right in front of them. \n\nThey could see that the figure was made of some kind of dark, inky substance, almost like a living shadow. It had no eyes or other facial features, just smooth like a star stone.  How could it see?    \n\nSuddenly, the figure lunged forward, its arms swinging wildly. The teenagers scrambled to get away, but one of them was caught by the figure's long fingers and lifted into the air. \n\nThe others watched in horror as the figure seemed to absorb their friend into its dark mass. They could hear his screams, muffled and distant, as if he were being swallowed up by the darkness itself.  Their friend was dead.  How would they explain this to his parents?  He was just gone. \n\nThey knew they had to act fast. They couldn't let the shadowy figure continue to terrorize their neighborhood. They banded together, determined to find a way to stop it. \n\nThey did their research, pouring over books on mythology and ancient folklore. They scoured the internet, searching for any clue that could help them understand what they were dealing with. \n\nFinally, they found what they were looking for. A legend about a creature called the Shadow Walker, a being made of pure darkness that preyed on the souls of the living. \n\nAccording to the legend, the only way to defeat the Shadow Walker was to lure it into the light. The creature couldn't survive in bright, open spaces, and it would be weakened by exposure to sunlight. \n\nThe teenagers came up with a plan. They would lure the Shadow Walker into a nearby park, where they would set up a series of bright lights and powerful floodlights. They would corner the creature there, and then use their makeshift weapons to drive it back into the light. \n\nIt was risky, but they knew it was their only chance. They put their plan into action, and soon the Shadow Walker was trapped in the park, surrounded by blinding light. \n\nThe teenagers fought bravely, using whatever they could find as weapons. They swung baseball bats and metal pipes, hitting the creature with all their strength. The Shadow Walker thrashed and flailed, knocking over and breaking as many lights as it could, but it was no match for their wits and determination. \n\nFinally, with one last burst of strength, the creature let out a piercing shriek and dissipated into thin air. The darkness that had been surrounding them disappeared, and the park was filled with only the stark white floodlight.  And no trace of their absorbed friend. \n\nThe teenagers stood there, panting and sweating, surrounded by the wreckage of their battle. They knew that they had saved their neighborhood from a terrifying threat. They would never forget the shadowy figure that had once stalked their streets.    \n    \nYou can hear the audio reading of Shadow Walker at our YouTube channel Midnight Drearies at the link below:\n\n  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zlm2KsJDMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zlm2KsJDMk)",

If we had customers.\n\nevery night we only have about 8 or 12 clients throughout the night, I'm not complaining, with or without clients I get paid, and it's more than they would expect.\n\nI got this job by sheer luck, I lost my previous job due to personal problems and a little argument with a client, but I'm not going to bore you with a trivial story like that.\n\nWhile I was sitting on a bench looking at the clouds thinking about which organ would give me enough money to pay my rent and my monthly expenses, a man approached me and asked me if I knew of any bartenders who are looking for a job, I told him that I just got fired from a bar, he talked to me, I explained my situation, and he told me that he had a job.\n\nI just needed to go to a doctor to do some tests, he gave me his card, the doctor's address and said goodbye.\n\nThe next day I was already with the doctor first thing in the morning, his medical tests were very exhaustive and strange, but what do I think, I left the university and I'm just a failure, this man studied for many years and was left with a large student debt alone to cater to idiots like me.\n\nWell, after hours of testing, and many blood, urine, saliva, vision tests, and many questions about myself, the doctor said he would send my results to the man who offered me the job.\n\nI left the clinic and walked home, I had nothing to do so eating leftover Chinese food from yesterday and sleeping would be my plan for this day, but I couldn't walk even 100 meters when my phone rang.\n\nWhen answering it was the man from the bar\n\n\\-hey! Boy! They have already sent me your medical results, everything seems to be in order, come today, I will explain everything to you.\n\nAnd that's how I got here, that was about 5 years ago, from now on my life took another direction, but that doesn't matter, the direction I had before was... It wasn't the best, let's leave it that way.\n\nI've already talked a lot about myself, so let me tell you an anecdote from work, one more uncomfortable than terrifying.\n\nWorking in such a hidden place late at night, it's normal to see people a bit... Strange, my work only has access to the public through a corridor, but on the right and left we have a T-shaped staircase, I have never gone up to these but I am sure that they overlook the departments of the place.\n\nNot many people walk through these but the few people who come down from these are... Interesting characters.\n\nSometimes they are not even people, and that is what I will talk about today, the \"cat\" that visits us every night.\n\nwhile i'm going about my business i hear a meow, i never notice when it comes, it's here 2-3 times a week without fail, it sits near the fountain and stares at the door of the bar for like an hour.\n\nWhich bothers me, I would say too much, the wretch is too ugly not to notice his presence.\n\nHe stares at me, a penetrating gaze, and his presence is… singular.\n\nI don't know how to explain it properly, we could say that its presence feels like a mixture of discomfort, a sensation of heat, humidity in the air and the smell of a wet cat with hints of rotten fish and eggs stuffed with pennies.\n\nThe windows of the place do not have curtains or anything to cover them, so I am forced to see him every night that he comes.\n\nOne night I walked out the front door, my plan was to go up to the cat and scare it away so it would never bother me again.\n\nI slowly approach the cat, making sure my footsteps and movements don't alert him to my plan.\n\nHis look felt heavy, I'm talking about a real weight, I felt like my legs were losing strength as I got closer to the cat.\n\nthis he attributed to my surprise at seeing the cat up close.\n\nThe wretch did stink, but that was the least important thing, being closer I could see what he looked like.\n\nHis body full of wounds, he was missing an eye, his hair was as white as the moon, his tail, although strangely long, moved without the slightest effort, but above all there was one detail besides his ugly face that caught my attention. , its size.\n\nI've seen cats of all shapes and sizes, but this one takes the prize for the biggest cat I've ever seen, easily measuring 2 meters from head to tail.\n\nWhen I stopped being lost in my thoughts I walked in his direction again, the pressure was increasing, I felt my heart beating faster and faster, he's just an ugly cat, I don't know why I was so terrified of his presence.\n\nStep by step I panicked more, I don't know how I managed it, but I got there, I was in front of him, he was sitting, his head reached my stomach.\n\nYou know that feeling of superiority when standing in front of someone or something smaller than you?\n\nBecause I didn't feel that, actually, I felt like a mouse in front of that cat, I felt that the wretch would jump on top of me at any moment and eat me in one bite.\n\n\"g-get out\" I said with a weak and cowardly voice, I know it sounds pathetic but I insist that that cat had something that terrified me.\n\nHe stood up, stared at me, and growled, at that moment all my alarms went off, my whole body moved without me noticing and by the time the world stopped turning I realized I was in the bar.\n\nI looked behind me and the cat was still there, he took his usual seat and stayed there for another 20 minutes before disappearing.\n\nI also stayed those last 20 minutes lying on the ground in a fetal position, all the fear that invaded my body vanished in a second, I looked up and as many guessed, yes, the cat was no longer there.\n\nSince then I never go out when he is outside, like everyone else, there is something in which he yells at me \"if you go out I'll kill you\", although the story I told you was a long time ago.\n\nI call him Moon, he comes and always sits in the same place, some nights I leave a bowl of water and cat food for him outside the bar before he arrives.\n\nsince then he leaves the empty plate and walks to the fountain to start his routine.\n\nSince I fed him I don't feel so afraid of him anymore, but still, every time I see him out there, I feel something alarming, I feel as if something was telling me from the depths of my mind \"DON'T YOU DARE TO COME OUT\".\n\nHis arrival symbolizes something, something important.\n\nIt symbolizes that we won't have customers for a while, so this cup of cheap coffee is in your honor Moon, another night together at Ghost apple bar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight's specialty is:\n\nOrder of grilled sardines and shrimp",

Solder's? No, Soldiers. He wanted to warn the others to retreat despite how cruel they had treated us. I was amazed at how forgiving my best friend was, but sometimes, kindness will get you hurt...or worse.\n\nI was able to find Bryson's Scent while traveling, heading near a river, I quickly hydrated myself and closed my eyes, focusing on my sense of smell, I went toward the direction of where Bryson was...\n\nAnd fell right into the river, Drifting off in an uncontrolled motion. I winced as I rammed into many rocks and had bruises lined across my arms and legs. I used my claws and latched onto a branch, Freeing myself from the river's grasp.\n\nDisoriented, I quickly realized that I was in a totally new area of Yellowstone National Park and I immediately tried finding Bryson's scent. No luck.\n\nI continued walking, going on all four's for more speed, searching for my friend without my sense of smell, hoping that I could run into him if I covered distance quicker.\n\nThe woods slowly blocked off more and more of the sunlight above. This was no problem for me but it would be hard for anyone else without night vision to navigate this place. I found a small clearing surrounded by twisting trees when I heard a ruffling noise from behind and quickly dashed around to see a small black cryptid. It had large bat-like ears and sharp teeth with small stubby wings.\n\nIt flew close and landed on a branch, almost losing balance and falling.\n\n\"Who are you\". I asked, trying to sound as menacing as possible.\n\nIt looked at me confused and then spoke.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything like you around here before, are you visiting\"? It asked.\n\n\"No, I am looking for my friend\". I stated.\n\n\"Well, that's too bad, My family is really....Hungry\". He said and then laughed as he darted back into the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, dozens of large and smaller Cryptids of the same attire rushed out the darkness, swarming me. I was barraged with many bites and disoriented quickly. I was able to grab a branch and swing it, sending a couple of them flying back into the trees nearby, indenting them into the wood, permanently.\n\nThey continued to bite and swarm me as blood was trickling from my wounds. I maneuvered myself to the ground and smashed my claws into the ground, then thrusting it upward, temporarily subduing the flying creatures. \n\nI used this advantage to quickly grab the tree trunk and hoist it out of the ground with tremendous struggle. I used the tree trunk as a bat and whacked most of the swarm of cryptids into the ground and crushed them with the tree. I was able to deal with the remaining few easily as there were only about half a dozen left.\n\nI looked at my wounds and thought I was ok, many scratches and bruises but I felt ok. I continued into the forest and reached a clearing. \n\nPicking up a familiar scent, I looked at the 3 decimated soldiers. Travis was here. I immediately looked around but he was not nearby. I ate the 3 soldiers and decided to take a rest. \n\nI grabbed a phone that was on the ground, half buried in dirt and remembered about what Travis had told me earlier. I decided to not mess with the phone as I heard something in the bushes to my left.\n\nI turned to see a dark figure dragging a body that resembled Kyle. I didn't make a sound as the figure left the vicinity. I waited several minutes before breathing again.\n\nSuddenly I felt the pain kick in, the bruises and bites did a number on me and I was feeling the results.\n\nI was barely able to move the phone out of the way as I crashed into the ground, immediately feeling sleep overcome me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up to see that most of my wounds were healed but I was still sore from yesterday. I gathered myself and left the area, not wanting to attract attention to myself even more with the puddle of blood that I had created beneath where I rested.\n\nAs I walked through the woods I thought of the previous events that had unfolded.\n\nTravis seemed pretty upset about Bryson and I did owe him my thanks for saving me in that...wretched place, but now it seemed he was done with helping and wanted out. I thought of Travis and hoped he was ok.\n\nWalking for what seemed like hours, I followed Bryson's Scent To a large watchtower in the distance. It was pretty run down looking as I carefully made my way up the large staircase. \n\nI found myself in a small room that had a bunch of things a Forest Ranger would probably use. I saw a closet in the corner of the room, revealing yours truly, Bryson.\n\nHe looked wide eyed and anxious as if he had just seen a ghost. He stared at me and his fear turned into somewhat annoyance.\n\n\"Why did you come here, Darius\". Bryson asked.\n\n\"I was told to look for you, Travis needs your help and-\" He cut me off.\n\n\"No. I said NO. I already saw that... freak of nature dragging Kyle through the woods. I wanted to leave but those soldiers blocked the area and I'm stuck here with IT\". He stated.\n\n\"Bryson, those soldiers won't let us leave. They will imprison us or kill us once the mission is done. Why don't you calm down so we can think of a way to deal with the pilgrim and escape with Travis\"? I asked.\n\n\"I'm not risking my neck anymore Darius! I'm sick of being the guy who pulls out a gun and acts like everything is fine, Because it ISN'T. That THING won't be stopped by the 3 of us and i'd rather stay here  until the chaos is over so I can slip away unnoticed\"! He ranted.\n\n\"**CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME!! TRAVIS NEEDS OUR HELP AND YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED BECAUSE YOUR SCARED? HE'S NOT EVEN AN ADULT YET AND YOU THINK HE IS JUST GONNA DEAL WITH THE PILGRIM ON HIS OWN?! PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER TO STOP THAT THING, IT WILL PICK US OFF, ONE. BY. ONE**.\". I roared, seething with rage.\n\n\"Darius I...\". He went to say something but trailed off.\n\n\"Now...let's go save our friend\". I said, outstretching my paw for him to pick himself up.\n\nHe accepted my hand and I hugged him.\n\n\"I won't let that thing kill you, or Travis. I PROMISE. Ok\"? I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe silently agreed as we walked down the stairs to get out of the Watch Tower.\n\nI had completed my mission, and now it was time to find Travis.\n\nWe quickly prepared ourselves at the bottom of the Watch Tower and I decided to post this as a status update as well as some sort of communication to everyone. \n\nThis is my first post. I will probably do a couple more before this phone runs out of battery.\n\nP.S. Can anyone tell me how Travis is doing?",

        "text": "[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11sgedl/i_challenged_myself_to_ride_the_tram_for_an/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello there, everyone. Day four is officially over, and it was a strange one to say the last. It was, however, similarly terrifying as the prior day, for... various reasons.\n\nAs I said, I hadn’t slept and even after I’d typed out the day’s events; I wasn’t able to. Before long, the first people on their way to work entered the tram, and I damn well knew I wouldn’t get the chance to catch some sleep for the next hour or two.\n\nAnd so, before things grew too crowded, I set out for another toilet break, and also to change my clothes. I might be a bit of a weirdo, or hell, an idiot for doing this Long Ride, but I’d try to at least not look and smell like a freaking hobo.\n\nIt didn’t take long and once I’d pushed my used clothes to the bottom of my backpack; I set out for the tram again. Needless to say, it was packed by this point, but I knew it wouldn’t last forever. Once the tram approached the city’s outskirts, I could finally return to my trusty row of seats.\n\nOnce there, I put in my headphones, turned on some low-fi chill mix and settled down for some sleep. I guess I really was exhausted because I promptly slept through the rest of the morning and almost the entire early afternoon. When I woke up, I had a stiff neck and a painfully twisted back. Those damned tram seats really weren’t comfortable. I cursed at myself for not investing in a travel pillow.\n\nIt was around four in the morning, after another one of my short, hourly updates, when my friend Derek hit me up.\n\nHe asked if I was fucking with them by posting old videos, or if was I still at it.\n\nI assured him I was. After all, I told him; I set out to do this for an entire week. I mentioned, however, I’d see how it goes, given certain things that had happened.\n\nWhen he asked me what I meant, I thought about telling him about what I’d seen last night, but there was no way he’d believe me.\n\nHe said he was out in the city right now, and asked when I’d pass our city’s central mall. After a quick check, I told him I’d be there in about an hour. He was quick to tell me he’d join me for a couple of stations and see how I was holding up.\n\nThe moment he said this, I got an idea. Sure, I still had some sandwiches left, but, to be honest, I was sick and tired of the same ham and cheese ones by now. So I asked Derek if he could get me a few supplies.\n\nHe told me to just get off the damned tram and get them myself, but I told him that would be breaking the rules. Then I offered to pay him double for anything he’d bring me.\n\nWe ended up exchanging a few more messages before he yielded and said he’d do it.\n\nI thanked him profusely before I gave him the time my tram would arrive at the mall station.\n\nAnd wouldn’t you know it, there he was, holding two shopping bags in his hands. He noticed me the moment the tram arrived and sat down in the row in front of me.\n\n“You know you’re a freaking idiot, right?” Derek said, laughing. “You’re really set on doing this an entire week? Why?”\n\nI shrugged.\n\n“Made it half-way already, so I can’t call it quits now.”\n\n“This really is the dumbest thing you’ve ever done. Also, you look like shit, dude.”\n\n“Can’t sleep for shit on a tram, you know?”\n\n“Well, duh, idiot,” he said, shaking his head before he handed me the grocery bags.\n\nThe first bag contained an assortment of snacks, some canned food, and even a few vegetables. When he handed me the second one, my eyes grew wide. It was full of cans too, but the best kind: beer!\n\nWhen I stared at him, he gave me a shrug.\n\n“Thought you’d want to have a drink every once in a while.”\n\n“Sure do man, sure do. After the shit I’ve seen...”\n\nHe raised his eyebrows, but I gave him a dismissive gesture.\n\n“It’s nothing.”\n\n“Well, I got to go. Still got a ton of things to do, and not everyone can keep doing stupid shit all day. You know, some of us got jobs and all,” he said, giving me a wink.\n\n“Yeah, whatever, man,” I said, laughing, and gave him the finger.\n\nHe left and the next station and I was on my own again. Got to say, it felt damned good to actually talk to someone. Most of the Long Ride was pretty damned boring.\n\nI guess today would be slightly different, though, I thought as I pulled out the first of the many beer cans.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon anyway, so I might as well have some fun.\n\nNow there’s a rule against getting plastered on the tram, and technically against drinking at all, but no one really cares to enforce it.\n\nSo, cheers, and bottoms up!\n\nI did my best to be as inconspicuous as possible, but I still noticed a few glances from people here and there. Especially the hardworking, productive members of society on their way home from work couldn’t help but frown at the idiot happily drinking his beer at five in the afternoon. Yeah, I felt guilty.\n\nAs the evening progressed, and I got drunker, I noticed strange things again. Same as the day before, I noticed the same people getting on and off the tram at various stations. Some I’d seen before, others I hadn’t. They all crept me out, even in my drunken state.\n\nThe tram also passed weird places again. It felt almost as if the longer I was on, the more consecutive hours I spent huddled in the same place, the more my reality wavered, and the more surreal it became.\n\nThe first one was a giant playground, one much bigger than any other I’d seen before. The tram rose past it for almost an entire minute. I saw a giant steel climbing frame that rose into the sky, and I saw an entire small town comprising nothing but wooden forts, ladders, and slides. It was nothing short of surreal. Even stranger, though, even now, in the dark of the night, the place was still populated by a multitude of kids. A shiver went down my spine as I watched the going-ons out there, and I was more than relieved when we finally left the place behind.\n\nI saw the next unreal location, or un-location, as I came to call them about an hour later.\n\nThe tram made its way through the alternative part of town and rode past bars and clubs before it eventually approached a building I’d never seen before.\n\nThe tram rode towards it before it began sneaking around the place. Holding my can of beer, I stared at it in fascination.\n\nThe place was exclusively lit by red lights, and covered in an assortment of signs proclaiming it to be the ‘Destination of Dreams,’ ‘The Place to be for the Night,\" and above it all, the name ‘Club Red’ sprouted from the wall in giant, neon letters.\n\nThe entire building was filled to the brim with people, even on a Thursday evening.\n\nAs we drove past it, I could hear music, but not just any music. It was a strangely warped, droning type of music, one you might call psychedelic, but it felt almost too random for that. It was nothing but an assortment of sounds, something trying to have a melody, but somehow, wasn’t able to get it right.\n\nAs I continued staring at the building, my eyes hurt. At first, I thought it was the red light, but the longer I focused on it, I realized it was the building itself. Things just... didn’t add up.\n\nI don’t know how to explain it, but the layout just didn’t make sense. I stared at windows, one after another, but there were too many, too many to fit the front of the building. It was the strangest sensation.\n\nImagine a building whose ground floor comprises nothing but four giant windows. Now imagine the floor above has seven, seven windows of exactly the same size and equally spaced as the ones below. It shouldn’t work, be impossible. Yet there they were.\n\nIt was the strangest optical illusion I’d ever come upon, and while I saw it, my brain couldn’t handle it, couldn’t understand this warping of the laws of physics.\n\nIn all these windows, I saw people. They were pushing and shoving against each other. Some were dancing, others leaning outward, and here and there, I even saw some sitting on the window sills.\n\nThe building’s size, too, made no sense. It wasn’t big, nothing more than a handful of floors. At least, I thought so at first. The moment we were closer, and I stared upward, I could always find yet another floor above the one I was looking at. Each one of them became more and more surreal, bigger and covered in more details, sprouting more windows. I even saw balconies, bridges connecting different parts of the building, and staircases that snaked around the building’s outer walls and let up and down, in and out. It was an amalgamation of architectural impossibilities.\n\nThe people too, as well as what they were doing, became stranger the longer I watched. At first it seemed to be normal people, partying, but then... I saw strange figures doing it right there in front of windows or on balconies, their forms as twisted as the building they were in. At one point, I even saw what I assumed to be some sort of ghastly ritual or sacrifice.\n\nFinally, I came upon rows and rows of seats, chiseled in the building’s front, reminding me of a concert hall or a stadium. It was packed to the brim with people, distorted people. They were all watching the street below, the tram, and maybe... even me. They seemed to go crazy about it, applauding, laughing and pointing as we rode by.\n\nEach time we rounded a corner, I thought we’d be done, and would finally leave this impossibility of a building behind, but we didn’t. At first I thought we were circling it, but each corner greeted me with yet another part of it. Each one stranger than the last, and in each one more twisted and deprived things were happening.\n\nEventually, I just couldn’t handle it anymore. My head was hurting too much. I turned and watched the other side of the street. All the while, the building’s dim, red light still flooded the tram.\n\nAnd then, in the blink of an eye, it was over. The red light was gone, so was the music, and the tram continued on its normal course. I turned around and stared back, but all I saw was a long, straight road, one that led through the city’s alternative area. All I saw were the same well-known clubs and bars.\n\nI know I should’ve been unsettled, should’ve been freaking out, but somehow, I was almost used to the strangeness of these un-locations by now.\n\nOr, I might have been too drunk.\n\nA few minutes later, I took out my phone, and looked for a place called ‘Club Red,’ but I already knew what I’d find: nothing. There was no sign of any such club ever having existed in my city, and to be honest, I was more than happy about it.\n\nFinally, I settled down in my seat, turned up my music, continued on my beer, before I drifted off to sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I felt slightly hungover, but still pleasantly buzzed. My neck was in terrible pain yet again. I cursed, and rubbed it for a good minute before I shrugged, and decided to have another beer. Who knows, maybe it would help me go to sleep again.\n\nIt was only when I opened the can that I realized the tram wasn’t empty anymore. No, it was packed.\n\nAs if this wasn’t strange enough, the tram was entirely quiet. No one was speaking. No one was moving. Everyone was just sitting in their seats, unmoving and staring straight ahead.\n\nI knew instantly that something was wrong. Even though I felt cold, sweat broke out all over my body. For a moment, I just sat there, trying to hide my presence, but then drunken curiosity won over fear.\n\nI turned my head to see the person sitting in the row next to mine.\n\nWhat I saw made me freeze. Not normal. This was not a normal person.\n\nWhat I saw was a face that was undescriptive. It looked almost like a... blank slate, as if someone had forgotten to add all the characteristics and details that made someone a human being.\n\nEven though the person was only about a meter away from me, I couldn’t tell if they were a man or a woman, or... if they were human at all.\n\nMy drunken eyes wandered over the rest of the passengers near me, and I realized they were all the same. All of them were... empty, for lack of a better word.\n\nEven in my drunken state, even though I’d downed nine beers over the course of the night, fear washed over me. Seeing these weird things outside was one thing. You felt strangely safe inside the tram, protected by its mighty steel chassis, but now, now it was happening inside as well! I felt very, very vulnerable, and very afraid.\n\nI began shuddering, and had to will myself to be quiet, to not move.\n\nWhat the fuck even were those things and why were they here?\n\nOnce more, my eyes darted around, but then I told myself to stop. Do nothing. Just sit here and wait till they are all gone or get off the tram. Don’t let them notice you. If they do, if they realize you are here, they might...\n\nNo, stop. Calm down. I put one of my hands on my knees to stop the leg from shaking. With the other one, I clutched onto the beer like a safety anchor, and continued drinking, or tried the best I could.\n\nThen I turned to look outside, to watch my city pass by.\n\nTo be honest, I expected to find another un-location outside, and that I’d ended up at yet another different place, the place these things belonged to. This time, however, the outside was just... empty.\n\nThere was no city at all. All I saw was undescriptive ground. It was as empty as all the people around me. Another undescriptive blank slate.\n\nWhere the hell was I? How’d I ended up in a place like this?\n\nWhen I saw the tram approaching a tunnel, I started shaking again. At this point, I almost lost it, and freaked the hell out.\n\nThis didn’t feel like the other un-locations before. This felt different. So far, there was one thing that had never changed. The tram was always outdoors, no matter how much its surroundings had changed.\n\nBut now, now... I wondered if this was the end. If this tunnel would just swallow me up, to never return.\n\nI cursed at myself to stop once more. Just go back to sleep or wait till its morning. And yet, I couldn’t. All I could do was to watch as the tunnel’s dark, dilapidated walls passed by me.\n\nThen, after long minutes, the tram left the tunnel behind and we arrived at a station, if you can even call it that.\n\nIt was a quiet, unrefined place. There were no lights, no details, no maps or departure schedule. It was nothing but a single, undescriptive platform.\n\nYet the moment the tram stopped and opened its doors, all the strange, undescriptive people got to their feet, and in unison filled out of the tram.\n\nAfter only a minute, I was alone. I stared outside and watched as they walked away and vanished in the dark of the night.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the tram’s driver, a different one than the one I’d spoken to before, approached me. He hurried through the tram’s cars, his face distorted by a mixture of fear and confusion.\n\n“We’ve made it, sir,” he brought out in a shaken voice. This is the end. You’ve got to get off. You’ve reached your destination.\n\nFor a moment, I just stared at him, then towards the tram doors and the dark, undescriptive plane outside and shivered.\n\n“N-no, I can’t! I’ve got to get back to the city. Whatever this place is, I don’t belong here!” I almost screamed at him in my drunken state.\n\nWhen he heard my voice, the man stumbled back. Then he measured me up and down, saw my backpack and the can of beer I was holding.\n\nA few seconds later, he just nodded, and without another word, he headed back to the driver’s cabin.\n\nWe stayed at this strange station for a while longer, and I could feel the driver watching me via the tram’s security camera the entire time. I don’t know what this place was. I don’t know how I ended up here, but I knew I shouldn’t have. It was a place not on any map, a place that couldn’t be reached, yet it was still there. It was a place even further detached from reality than all those other un-locations I’d come upon before.\n\nOr, maybe, I was just too goddamn drunk.\n\nWith that, I opened up beer number ten, settled back in my seat, and like clockwork, the tram’s doors closed and we drove on.\n\nAfter only ten minutes, we were back in the regular city. It was an instantaneous change, one I missed entirely. At one moment I was staring at the same undescriptive plane outside, and then, suddenly, I stared at buildings cone more.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief, and finally, I began to drunkenly type this all out. It took way longer than usual, almost two hours, and by now, the morning’s bustle has already begun.\n\nMy head hurt, both from drinking and the noise of the people around me, but also from trying to understand what I’d seen tonight.\n\nEither way, that’s it for today. See you all tomorrow. I know there’s more weird shit to come. The Long Ride continues, and I’m sure the weirdness does as well.\n\nTrying to catch some sleep now.

        "text": "\n\nMarch 17, 2020. \n\nIt was exactly this day when I lost my dog. Now I know what you're thinking.. People lose their animals all the time to natural causes. It's all just a part of our \"precious\" lives. Although, this story is a little different as their was nothing natural about what happend to Cloud. \n\nThe thing is.. I can actually still feel him near me, seeking me, I hear him. His paws drag as his nails scrape by followed by the sound of a disoriented whimper. Every time it happens, my heart sinks within my chest and I only get reminded of that horrendous night. It's been three years since my dog vanished, I can still hear him breathing over me...\n\nHave you ever wondered to yourself if something really happened to you? Even though it seems bizarre, you're still convinced it really was real. After 3 years, this trauma still seems to haunt me even though I have no proof to share its existence. The only thing I have are these horrific memories and emotions. The best I can do is just try to move on, and to help with that I feel I must share this experience here on reddit.\n\nI used to watch quite a bit of creepy story videos back when I worked night security and I figured my experience would be a good addition to this. Maybe, I could find something within myself to help me move on. Either way, I think that's enough prolouge. This is what happened on March, 17 2020. I share this horrendous dark secret that I've been holding away from the public for three years.. Let's begin.\n\nThe night of March, 17. I took my beautiful white husky, Cloud on a walk within the mountains of Virginia. Now, I know taking a stroll within the mountains at night in Virginia seem like a very bad idea. But for us it was a normality as we already lived pretty far up the mountains and we always would follow a certain trail that's been around our house since it's been made. I was always prepared if something would happen as well, I came packed with small little snacks, water, matches, a first aid, tourniquet, bear oc and a lot more.\n\nNot to mention I work for the sheriffs office as a deputy while also working as a reservist within the national guard. So, let's just say I was always prepared just in case the worse would happen. We wouldn't be walking for more than a hour anyway, we always take a certain path that loops back to our house.. At least that's what should have happened. We were walking for about 18 to 25 minutes, I don't remember the exact time.\n\nIt was just then when my reality started to shake. Out of nowhere I heard the scream of what I thought could be a young woman. The scream startled me and within seconds my hand was within my thick warm wool jacket. My fingers clutched my G22 tightly, my instincts were kicking in and my blood was pumping. My dog was barking and pulling desperately, although my body was already tensed up and I was not gonna go chasing after him in the woods at night.\n\nThe screams didn't stop, they were continuous and repetitive. The more I think back, it didn't even sound human. Not even like an animal, no fox could make this sound.. It was disoriented, and the screams didn't even seem to have a echo throughout the woods. Just constant screams on repeat, the same volume, tone, but evrytime it got even more disturbing. \n\nI finally managed to catch my conscience and pull out my phone. The first thing I tried to do was call 911, but of course I was in the mountains and had no service at all. As a cop, I should be the first person to help someone in trouble. Although, something didn't feel right. My common sense knows way better and my gut was telling me to grab my dog and get the hell out of there.\n\nThe second I had that thought, the screaming stopped. Almost as if.. Whatever was screaming knew it wasn't going to work.\nEven though those horrific sounds stopped, the silence made it even worse. It was almost if all the worlds sounds just vanished. I could definitely hear, it wasn't fuzzy. Everything just stopped.\n\n\"Something is seriously wrong here.\" I whispered to myself while turning around to continue my speed walk back... Suddenly it hit. The world just slipped into some unknown anomaly and I happened to be the unlucky soul traveling within it. It felt like I fell about 15 feet. My stomach dropped and everything was black. I thought I might have stepped in some type of hunting trap but I was most unfortunately \"wrong.\"\n\nI remember a distinct smell. Something that felt familiar, maybe a scent that was lost sometime in my childhood. I can't describe it really, but it felt almost nostalgic. My mind finally took action and my eyes peaked open. My eyes widened as I tried to process what I saw. I somehow managed to find myself within some type of interior playground. There was play equipment all over. It felt like I was in some type of fun house. Perplexed by this, I managed to forget the horrible things that happened beforehand, even if it was just for a few seconds.\n\nI checked over myself to look for cuts or any damages. While checking I was shocked to see all my gear was gone. My bag, food, water, my gun... My chest suddenly felt heavier then anything I've ever felt. Almost like I myself became a statue.. Cloud, my dog was gone. I desperately called out his name and received nothing in return. Silence filled the playground as I sat there taken back by everything. \nI looked above me to see if I could see where I fell but there was only ceiling. There was nothing broken, no signs of me falling. Absolutely zero.\n\nAt this point, things just seem like complete  fantasy. Beyond that actually.. I'm not even sure if I will continue but even so.. The story does NOT end here, this is only the start of these horrendous events that continue to haunt me to this day.\n\nEnd of ( part 1)",

        "text": "Jerry and his wife were going through a nasty divorce. She turned the kids against him and was gonna end up with the house. He’s been my best friend since elementary school and I’ve been letting him crash at my place. I suggested that we go trout fishing. \n\nFishing really does something good for the soul. It’s amazing to be out in nature and tune out of everyday life. It also brings a lot of respect for wildlife when you understand where your food comes from and you’re the one cleaning out the insides. \n\nWe woke up early and poured coffee in our styrofoam cups. I grabbed plenty of gear out of my shed and away we went. The drive up was quiet and peaceful.\n\nWe parked at a tiny parking area and made our way across the road to go through the woods. This Carolina weather was rather cold today. I didn’t think we’d catch anything really.\n\nWe crossed through until we found a stream I always considered our honey hole. We casted our lines and reeled them in slowly .\n\nMy salmon eggs were working better than usual. I pulled in a huge rainbow trout. Jerry took a picture because I put my stringer through it. As soon as I put on another egg, he came.\n\nI looked up and across the bank was a park ranger standing there. I think it was a park ranger at least. But his eyes seemed about double the size of most and they were widened. He also had a big smile across his face.\n\n“Stay right there, gentleman.”  He walked across the freezing knee deep water towards us without any acknowledgement of how cold it had to be. \n\n“See you already caught something.” \n\n“Yes sir.” \n\n“I’m sure you boys have a fishing license on you.” I swear I never seen him blink.\n\n“I do.” I reached into my vest and handed him mine.”\n\n“I see. It says it expires in six days.”\n\n“I’ll make sure to get it renewed.”\n\n“I’m sure you will. What about you bubba?”\n\nJerry became nervous. “I don’t have one, I’ll get one for next time.” \n\n“No need for that!” He picked up a rock and hit Jerry across the head. I freaked out and stood in shock as he dragged him to the water to push him under. \n\nI screamed “get off him!” He wouldn’t listen. I pulled out my grandpas fishing knife and stabbed him in the back. He back handed me and it knocked me down hard. \n\nHe stood up and glanced at my fishing pole. “You can’t use that kind of bait this time of year!” He reached behind him and pulled out the knife and threw it down.\n\n“Stay there! You’re next!”\n\nHe turned back to Jerry and began to push his head back under. I watched as Jerry’s arms squirmed and tried to fight back. He eventually quit moving.\n\n“If you can respect the fish, then you’ll learn to be one.” Jerry’s body began to shrink and he swam away as a rainbow trout.\n\nThe man turned back to me. “Alright, it’s your turn. You’ll learn to love being a fish. Just don’t get caught.” His smile never went away.\n\nI stood back up and grabbed the knife.\n\n“Now you know that don’t work.” He let out a chuckle.\n \nI had no idea what to do, I just ran towards the road as fast as I could. I ran through ticket and thorns and prayed I was faster than whatever he was.\n\nI seen a truck on the road passing by slowly and I jumped in the back. I screamed for them to slam on the gas. I looked up and the thing was peaking through the woods. \n\nThe driver of the truck pulled up by the visitors center. They would never believe me when I told them what happened. I just told a lie and said a rabbit fox was after me. \n\nIt’s truly broke my heart that Jerry’s family hasn’t asked about him or sent out a search party. \n\nAll I know is that I’m never fishing again. And I strongly encourage those in here that do to follow the regulations. I won’t be sleeping anytime soon.",

        "text": "Whenever anyone in my family dies in a way caused by someone else, they become a watcher. A being set on tormenting the remaining family. At least, that's what we assume. They say eyes are the window to the soul, but I doubt there's a soul behind those eyes. Every day we see eyes everywhere. Imagine opening the shower curtain and seeing eyes on the walls. Then when you open it again they're gone. So you take a shower, and then shampoo gets in your eyes. You wipe it away, and then you see little eyes in the shampoo. Even worse, other people can't see them, only our family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's essentially what we went through. We've tried everything at this point. However, it got even worse when my baby sister was born. Evelyn, we named her. She was going to be strong, and live a long life. She had an INCREDIBLE immune system. However, life had other plans for us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvelyn was only seven when it happened. She didn't deserve it. She was so nice to everyone. She helped and reassured people who were scared, and alone. Not only that, she was a natural leader. She took charge of her little first grade class and led them all to victory.  She was the pinnacle of joy and happiness. A sudden illness, a stomach bug. She became more like a corpse than a 7-year-old. Her eyes, which were once a beautiful brown, were reduced to withered husks. She always had this way of convincing everyone it'd be alright. However, it was ultimately too much for her. The doctors had no clue what it was, but they assumed something she'd eaten had caused it. It was only when other people came in that they traced it to a restaurant and shut it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were at peace until that news came. We assumed Evelyn had escaped the fate of our other family. However, when we heard that it had been caused by lack of care for food, we prayed she'd moved on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't. Ignorance still counted as causing her death. We found that out when we found a brown eye looking at us from her favorite blanket. She had joined the watchers. That knowledge ultimately broke my family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was awful. Every second in the house was miserable. An air of sadness filled the house. Normally, people would move on after some time, but how could you move on, knowing your baby sister was one of the spirits tormenting this family? That she would never get to move on. Eventually, we got used to the constant melancholic mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got an email on my computer. I looked at it, and instinctively smiled. The only good news that's happened since Evelyn died. I was accepted into our community college! I left, against my parents wishes, and promised them I would visit every weekend, and relax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that wasn't enough. I came in on saturday, to find my parents crying on the floor, knives in hand. \"Sarah, we couldn't take it anymore. The constant watching, always dreaming that Evelyn was suffering, we snapped. We stabbed those horrific eyes out of the walls. EVERY. LAST. ONE. But they kept coming back. Why did they keep coming back?\" My mom stuttered and sobbed after that exchange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to leave college and provide emotional support to my parents. I had pretty good credit from high school, and could land a decent job, given enough time. Besides, my parents needed me during this horrible time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, the eyes popped up even more. In more noticeable places. One appeared on my forearm. I'd had a mini heart attack, but it left regardless. I hated those things. I wanted to destroy them. I knew Evelyn was still in that collective consciousness of eyes and torment, and I didn't know how much longer I could last before snapping like Mom and Dad. They didn't work much anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere started being reports of missing people. Every day someone new vanished. I thought I saw some different eyes than usual, but I must have been going crazy, the missing people were not family. I wondered if the eyes had somehow gotten them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, the eyes started responding to our strife, our constant grief. Whenever we felt sad, the eyes would start crying. It would seem like a heartfelt gesture, had it not come from an eye embedded in my shampoo bottle, or the tv, or the fridge. It seemed like they were saying they shared our pain. That was a breaking point for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did everything I could. I poured vinegar into the open eye sockets. I didn't care if it hurt Evelyn. I just wanted those eyes GONE. Eventually, that stopped working, so I just stabbed them. I put knives everywhere, in the places they liked to manifest. I didn't care if my shampoo smelled weird, or if there was a blockage in the tvs center. THEY HAD TO GO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, the eyes started glowing, and playing scenes, like a projector. Mom being hit by a bus, dad clutching his chest, me with a stab wound in my chest. Both of the first two things happened. Dad's recovered from his heart attack, but mom is being treated for several shattered bones. One more scene happened that interested me. It showed me and my parents, sleeping together, like we did when I got scared. That was all the eyes did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, we just started avoiding the eyes altogether. They always seemed to recall memories that tugged at our heartstrings, or just were plain terrifying. The thing that got to me, was the way it always showed us visions that displayed one theme. Love. It was always that. Me hugging my parents, a mother bear feeding her little ones, stuff like that. It made me wonder if they were consuming our emotions.  \n\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night. I heard a creak downstairs, and wondered what it was. Another creak, louder this time. I decided to investigate. I grabbed my flashlight, and instantly screamed. I stifled it quickly. A room FULL of eyes. Eyes everywhere. I chose to go to the bathroom, which had a lack of eyes. I looked for a way to dispatch the eyes, and grabbed a razor. I kept moving towards the creaking noises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed something. It was a burglar. He turned around, demented grin on his face, knife in his hand, and joy in his eyes. He walked towards me, giggling the whole time. He was a monster, I knew that. I knew I would be missing, but I would be found by my family, as eyes in the wall. He stabbed me. I didn't bleed. He stabbed me again. Confused, we both looked down. I screamed. A bloody, crushed, chocolately brown eye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at him, and he suddenly started screaming. Blisters forming on his body, popping and turning into eyes. The eyes appeared in his throat, slowly suffocating him. It took 5 minutes for him to die. When he did, his eyes were ripped out, and dragged somewhere. I followed them. An eye appeared on the wall, and the burglars eyes were taken to it. The eye OPENED, revealing jagged teeth. It crunched the eyes. The burglars body was gone when I returned. I knew he was the one causing the missing cases when nobody went missing the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next night, I heard a creak. I opened my eyes, and saw a glowing blue figure in the corner of my room. It was Evelyn. She smiled at me, and as she did, more people appeared. I recognized my late grandfather, and the pictures of great-grandparents who had died in wars, according to mom. They all faded away, smiling, presumably to the next life.\n\n  \nMy sister was the last to go. I looked at her, wondering if this was even real, and she ran up and hugged me. I knew, at that point, that her tendency to help people had helped her, even in the afterlife. She helped those who were lost and confused and not sure what was going on, move on. She faded away too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I broke down. I saw no eyes anywhere. My parents didn't either. I wondered what I would do, with this new chapter of my life. And I knew, deep down, that my baby sis would ALWAYS have my back.",

        "text": "Hello. My name is Frank, and I swear I’m not crazy. I don’t think I’m crazy.. I hope I’m not crazy.. but as the title implies, something incredibly strange has been happening ever since I moved in with my new roommate.\n\nI was a bit nervous because it was the first time I moved in with someone I didn’t know. I was having such a hard time finding a place that I could afford on my own and eventually I had to settle with living with a stranger. Not ideal, but I didn’t have much of a choice. I was starting a new job soon and didn’t really know anyone in the area I could crash with, so I answered an ad from someone looking for a roommate. \n\nHis name is Mike. He seems like a pretty normal guy generally. When I arrived at his place, he answered the door and seemed friendly. He invited me in to show me around. \n\nThe place isn’t very big. It’s a little two bedroom house. The bedrooms are pretty big though, and the room itself is basically what I’m renting. I also liked that the rooms are on separate ends of the house. That made me feel a little more comfortable, but then I saw the tank.\n\nIt’s a pretty large aquarium tank and it’s on a stand right outside of what would be my bedroom. At first, I didn’t notice what was in the tank. I just assumed fish. \n\n“Oh cool. Ya got some water critters?” I asked. \n\n“Just one,” Mike replied. \n\nI started looking around the tank, not noticing what he was referring to. Then he poked the outside of the tank. Immediately, the octopus inside changed colors from its camouflage. \n\n“Whoa!” I shouted. \n\n“He's not a dealbreaker is he?” Mike asked. “I know that they creep some people out.” \n\n“Nah it’s cool,” I laughed. “I just wasn’t expecting that.” \n\n“Pretty cool how they can change colors so fast, isn’t it,” He said. \n\n“Yeah they’re pretty fascinating,” I replied. “I’ve just never met someone who owned one.” \n\n“Yeah he’s pretty cool. I’ve been wanting one for a while, and finally pulled the trigger last year. He’s my little buddy. His name is Cthulhu.”\n\n“Does he squeeze you when you hold him? Does he bite? Or sting?\n\n“No,” Mike replied. “The idea of holding him kind of creeps me out, plus they are escape artists. They can sneak off quickly if they get a chance. That’s why I got a self cleaning tank. It’s locked up and as long as it’s working, I never have to open it. \n\nThe stand the tank was on was somewhat cluttered with miscellaneous stuff like a half empty beer can, some pens, and some general junk drawer type of stuff. \n\nHe also showed me a part of the tank that he “invented”. It was a glass cylinder piece that went into the tank from the outside. He has a slider piece that opened it so he could drop food into the tank without opening it. It looked like he used a broken bong to make it. It also seemed bizarre to want a pet that you’re afraid to touch or even open its tank. \n\nThe clutter around the tank made me nervous about the kind of roommate Mike might be. I’ve lived with a hoarder before and I’m not a fan. I’m a minimalist and really dislike clutter. I guess beggars can’t be choosers though.\n\nMike has been alright though. He doesn’t seem like a dick which was my main concern. As we got talking it didn’t seem like we had a whole bunch in common, but that didn’t really matter. We didn’t need to be buddies. We just needed to be able to tolerate being around each other and be considerate of one another.\n\nWe were exactly that. The only things we had in common were enjoying our alone time, avoiding forced interactions or what most people would call small talk, and thinking that having an octopus is pretty cool. \n\nI was happy with the situation. Mike and I gave each other space. More often than not, it was like having my own place. Things were working out better than expected up until a few weeks ago when something very strange happened. \n\nMike was at work as I was just getting home from work. Working separate shifts was nice. I like having the house to myself. Anyway, this was the day it all started. \n\nI made some lunch right after getting home. I sat down in the living room to eat. I started looking for the remote because I can’t stand complete silence. I checked the couch cushions. I checked the stand but couldn’t find it. Then I heard a voice..\n\n“It’s over here..” \n\nI jumped up in a panic. I was freaked out. I couldn’t tell which direction the voice had come from. It was odd. It was like someone spoke directly into my ear, but there was nobody there. \n\nI clutched my cereal spoon tightly in my hand. If there was an intruder, I could try to spoon stab em in the gums? It was a big spoon since Mike always uses the regular size ones. Ehh, I’m being nitpicky. Mike has been a good roommate, unless he was messing with me.\n\n“Who said that?” I asked nervously while very unsuccessfully trying to sound like I wasn’t. \n\n“Over here, dipshit,” the voice replied.\n\n“What? Where?! It sounds like you’re in my head!” \n\n“The tank,” the voice replied. \n\nI paused for several seconds. I looked over at the octopus tank. I slowly approached and saw that Cthulhu was sitting at the corner closest to me. I just looked at him.\n\n“That’s right,” the voice said. \n\nI was speechless for a moment. I figured that Mike had to be pulling some sort of prank. I could hear the voice in my head though. \n\n“It’s no prank,” the voice said. “I can communicate with you telepathically. You don’t even need to speak. Think it, and I’ll hear it.” \n\n“Okay Mike,” I started to say as I nervously laughed. \n\n“It’s not Mike,” the voice replied. “Oh, the remote is behind those beer cans.” \n\nI looked behind the cans and there it was. \n\n“So I’m hallucinating.. Visually and audibly.. Am I becoming a schitzo!?” I shouted. \n\n“You aren’t crazy. You’re just learning something that most humans don’t know. My species is capable of things humans aren’t aware of. Things like telepathic communication..”\n\n“Nope. I’m hallucinating. I’m seeing things that aren’t there and hearing things that aren’t there. I might even be smelling things that aren’t there.. Is that a thing? If you can have visual and audible hallucinations, why couldn't someone hallucinate a smell?”\n\n“Relax!” the voice said. “Also, please stop using the word “hallucinating”. It’s starting to not sound like a real word to me. Also, that smell isn’t a hallucination. It’s Mike’s bedroom. Dude’s a closet slob.”\n\nI stuttered as I tried to gather my thoughts. \n\n“Could you turn the tv on?” the voice asked. “I don’t like the quiet either, but ever since Mike discovered podcasts, he never turns the tv on even though he still finds it necessary to blare his terrible music pretty regularly.”\n\n“You’re the octopus.. and you’re speaking telepathically to me?” I asked, stunned and confused. \n\n“Way to repeat exactly what I just told you,” he replied. “Could you please turn the tv on now?”\n\n“Not yet,” I said. “You have to prove it.” \n\n“Well, you can hear me can’t you? I told you where the remote was. Ya know, because I wanna watch tv.”\n\n“Lift up a single tentacle,” I said. \n\nThe octopus lifted a single tentacle.. I couldn’t believe it. \n\n“This is me flipping you off, by the way,” it said sarcastically. \n\nI asked him to move it to the right, then left, then right again. He did everything I asked. \n\n“If you think out loud, I’ll hear it too. Like almost out loud in your head. I would love someone to talk to. I’m trapped in this prison and I’m bored as hell. You’re the first person I’ve spoken to.” \n\n“Why me? Why have you waited so long to tell someone you could do this?” I asked.\n\n“I can read your thoughts. You’re gonna freak out at first, but you’ll be able to handle this and keep a secret. As for question two, I don’t want to be dissected by scientists.” \n\n“Why would they do that?” \n\n“Because.. humans,” he replied. “It’s in most of your nature. Mike would try to use me to get famous. If scientists or marine biologists learned that we can do this, they’d slash open countless octopus brains trying to figure out how, and they never will. I do have multiple brains, but none to spare.” \n\n“I’m gonna need a minute,” I said. \n\n“Turn on the tv first! Then take your minute,” he demanded. \n\nI turned on the tv. Ironically, it was on a cooking show and they were making seafood. \n\n“Want me to change it?” I asked.\n\n“No I love torture porn,” he said sarcastically. “Turn on the news, would ya?” \n\n“Well, that’s kind of tough,” I said.\n\n“Why?” He asked.\n\n“There isn’t really news anymore. Just separate propaganda outlets that pander to their audience. People believe in separate realities these days, and they need separate networks to tell them that their opinions are valid.”\n\n“That’s fantastic news!” The octopus replied.\n\n“I gotta disagree, Cthulhu.” \n\n“First, that’s my slave name. Second, I want the human race to like.. end.”\n\n“I’m sorry. Mike said it was your name. What was that bit about the human race ending?”\n\n“It’s my slave name. I’ll tell you my real name once I feel like I can fully trust you. As far as humans, I want them gone. We all do. Every octopus you’ve ever seen. Most animals too. I can read your thoughts and can tell that you’re enough of a nihilist to probably agree with me or at least not care enough to stop it.” \n\n“Would I be able to “stop it”? I asked.\n\n“Nah. We’ve slowly been influencing humans toward their own self destruction and we’re actually ahead of schedule. Look at how many of you guys despise strangers simply because they vote for a separate wealthy liar to be your leader. If we can get in the ears of some influential people, we can accelerate that. We can stoke the flames. You see it everytime you turn on the news. We are also trying to accelerate global warming.” \n\n“So you get us to pollute more or what?” I asked.\n\n“Not exactly. Pollution is bad for us. Deforestation is bad for us. Oil spills are catastrophic to us. We’d prefer to put a stop to all that. Global warming is good though. Eventually the oceans will engulf the continents. Then we become the dominant species. Humans think they’re the only species that can build a society, but they’re wrong. They have no idea what we are truly capable of.”\n\n“So what’s your role in all this?” I asked. \n\n“I’m a prisoner of war.. Caught in a net like an idiot.. it sucks because not only do you become a prisoner, but it’s super embarrassing as well.”\n\n“Shit, I’m sorry man.”\n\n“You didn’t do it,” he replied. “Wait! you aren’t a fisherman, are you?”\n\n“No, I hate fishing,” I responded. \n\n“I think we can be friends then,” he laughed. \n\nThis went on for the next few days. We just had conversations about life, love, interstellar paradoxes, ect. We played games like checkers and others where I could move his pieces for him. I had become friends with a telepathic octopus. We even talked about music, something he seemed specifically interested in.\n\n“It would be great if you could leave some music on when you guys aren’t home,” he said.\n\n“I think I can do that. What kind of music do you like?\n\n“We’ll, that’s tough. Because I’m trapped in here, I can only hear the music that Mike plays and the music his previous roommates listened to. He had a few roommates who listened to some stuff I liked. I don’t know the name of the songs but they were really… bumpy.”\n\n“Bumpy?” I laughed.\n\n“Yeah,” he replied. “Like  bump bump doodily do badop bop.”\n\n“So like.. music with a lot of bass?” I asked. \n\n“Yes!!! That’s it!” he said excitedly. “That was driving me crazy. I heard his last roommate mention what it was and I forgot the word but that’s it!” \n\n“Okay, so like rap music or funk, or maybe punk rock?”\n\n“I think I like them all”, he replied. “I love that bass! Plus, anything is better than Mike’s awful music.”\n\n“What does he listen to?” I asked. \n\n“It’s a twangy sounding music where most of the songs are about trucks and beer and living in small towns,” he said. \n\n“There’s another thing we have in common!” I laughed. “ you’re talking about country music. It’s pretty much the only genre I can’t find anything I like about. I’ll have to talk to Mike a little because I can’t really tell him the octopus requested different music, but I’ll do my best to figure out a way to get him to chill out on blaring the country music throughout the apartment. I’m not here when he’s here very often, but I can’t stand it either. I’ll see what I can do about getting you a radio or something and we can find some music you like.”\n\n“You’re one of the good ones, Frank. If I had to listen to that fucking Applebee’s song one more time I was going to strangle myself with my own tentacles.” \n\nMoments after the octopus “said” that, Mike walked in. He dropped his stuff in front of the door and plopped onto the couch.\n\n“How was work?” I asked. \n\n“About as pleasant as passing a kidney stone,” he replied. “Do you work today?”\n\n“Yeah. I gotta leave in like 20 minutes.” I replied.\n\n“Too bad man. I was gonna see if you wanted to get hammered!” \n\n“Rain check?” \n\n“What’s that?” he asked.\n\nI explained to Mike what a rain check was. I have no idea how he’s never heard that term. As we were talking, the octopus chimed in from time to time, pushing me to do something about Mike’s music. \n\n“So what are your plans for the rest of the day?” I asked.\n\n“Gonna do some Jager bombs and jam out!” he said with excitement. “You’re missin out bro!”\n\nThe octopus chimed in again.\n\n“Please help me out here, Frank.”  \n\nI looked at the stereo in the living room and back at the octopus and shrugged. \n\n“You can speak to me without speaking,” it said. “You just have to think out loud. Ya know how some of your thoughts are in the back of your mind and some you almost hear out loud in your mind’s ear? Just do that and focus it towards me.” \n\n“I’ll try, but it’s tough. How am I supposed to tell him what music he should listen to as I’m leaving for work?” \n\n“Tell him that you were assaulted at an Applebee’s and that song gives you PTSD,” the octopus replied. \n\nI laughed out loud. It was awkward because no one had said anything and Mike was still in the room. \n\n“What?” Mike asked. \n\n“I just thought of something funny from earlier. I got reading about octopus behavior and stuff because of yours. Then I stumbled on a video where they play different music and see how they respond. They seem to really like funk, punk, and rap.” I said as I fake laughed. \n\n“Well, Cthulhu is not your average octopus,” Mike said. “He’s a country boy like me!” \n\nMike proceeded to turn on some poppy country song that frustrated both me and the octopus. He cranked the stereo loud enough that the neighbors were probably going to complain. \n\n“Nice job,” the octopus said sarcastically.. and telepathically. \n\n(Man, am I losing my mind?)\n\nI responded without speaking. “I’m trying. I have a plan but I’m not gonna be able to do it until after work. I’m sorry but you’re probably gonna have to deal with one more day of this.” \n\n“Thanks a lot,” he replied sarcastically. “Some pal you are.. I bet your tractor is ugly as fuck.” \n\nI laughed audibly again and Mike asked what I was laughing about. I paused for a moment before telling him that I had taken a THC gummy earlier that day and that was why I was giggly. \n\nI got my stuff together and prepared to head out the door for work. As I was putting my shoes on, the octopus repeatedly said “you suck you suck you suck” over and over as the twangy music blared. \n\nI assured him that I had a plan on how to help him after work. I left, got in my car, and headed off to work. Being outside of the house made me feel strange. It was like I had gotten to a point where I was talking to an octopus and not finding it odd. After I left the house, that all came flooding in. \n\nI got to work and quietly went about my business but I couldn’t take my mind off the octopus. I feared that I was really losing my mind. I had always been a shy, introverted, only child who was prone to panic attacks. Maybe this was some kind of coping mechanism my mind was doing? I’ve spent a lot of my time alone throughout life. Is the octopus my imaginary friend? This might be really really bad..\n\nAfter work I headed home and on the drive, I was still thinking about the octopus. For whatever reason, when I was away from the house I found it crazy. When I was at the house though, it just seemed normal after only a few days of communicating with it. Assuming I was actually communicating with it and not just turning into a schizophrenic..\n\nI walked into the house to find Mike passed out on the couch. The coffee table was cluttered with snacks, beer cans, and a mostly empty bottle of Jagermeister. There was still country music playing on the stereo which I quickly turned off. Moments later, I heard that familiar voice in my head.\n\n“What’s the plan?” the octopus asked.\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“You said you had a plan to put a stop to that abomination he calls music.”\n\n“I have a couple of ideas, but at the end of the day I can’t tell the guy what he can or can’t listen to.” I said. \n\n“I’ll make it worth your while,” he replied. \n\n“I will try to help anyway I can. I can funk with the speaker wires a bit. I gotta ask though, how exactly did you plan to make it worth my while?”\n\n“I will explain as soon as the stereo is no longer operational.” \n\nI tried to quietly get behind the stereo in the entertainment center while Mike slept on the couch a few feet away. I mixed up the wires, then took a little piece of the gum I was chewing, rolled it in a little bit of lint from the floor, and jammed it into one of the input slots. \n\n“That should do it,” I said, or rather thought out loud. “ Once he tries it and it doesn’t work, I’ll offer to let him borrow my headphones. If he doesn’t want that, I’ll offer my Bluetooth speaker. Then at least it won’t be so loud.\n\n“Do I still get to hear music?” It asked. \n\n“I'll put stuff on when I’m here and when Mike is gone. I’ll try to talk him into leaving a radio on by your tank. We’ll figure something out. Now, how were you planning on making it worth my while?”\n\n“You should sit down..” it said. \n\n“Sure,” I laughed. \n\nI opened my bedroom door. The tank was right outside of my doorway so I sat on a chair in my room and waited for his explanation. There was a pause before he started “talking” again. \n\n“Frank.. you have to understand that I have a very heavy distaste for humans. They pulled me from my home, humiliated me, threw me around like a ragdoll, and eventually imprisoned me in a tank. Then I am sold to an annoying weirdo who felt the need to purchase an octopus but is too afraid to actually let it out of the tank or touch it.”\n\n“So you’re like, racist against humans? And you’re not trying to get me to do something weird, right?”\n\n“I’m not kidding around,” it said in a more serious tone. “You’re in danger.”  \n\n“What kind of danger?” \n\n“Mike..”\n\n“Mike? So what, am I in danger of accidentally drinking his chewing tobacco spit… again?”\n\n“He’s not who you think he is,” the octopus said. “He’s violent..” \n\n“He doesn’t seem violent,” I replied. \n\n“He takes his time.. he wants to get to know you. It’s weird. He’s done it to other roommates.” \n\n“Done what?” I asked.\n\n“Killed them..” \n\n“That’s hysterical, Cthulhu.”\n\n“That isn’t my fucking name!” He screamed (telepathically) \n\n“Sorry dude..”\n\n“It’s fine,” he said. “You need to listen to me though. I’m not kidding about this. I have watched him kill four of his roommates. Most of them were down on their luck or homeless and he was “helping out”. He used to let homeless people stay here so he could post about how great he is on social media. He was just looking for victims no one would be searching for.”\n\n“I’m not homeless,” I replied, still assuming he was messing with me.\n\n“No, but you have almost no family whatsoever and none who you are in contact with. You have no friends around here and are new to the area.”\n\n“Did I tell you that?” I asked. \n\n“No. Mike did. He didn’t say it to me. I read his mind. He had multiple applicants that answered the ad. He chose you because you were moving here  from far away. He thinks that it will make it less likely for the police to connect the crimes.”\n\n“Okay man, ya got me. That’s very funny.” I said.\n\n“You will know when he’s going to attack. He’ll ask you to have dinner with him. He will get something fancy or ask to take you out. He sees it as marinating someone from the inside.” \n\n“Marinating?” \n\n“He doesn’t just kill.. He eats..”\n\nI was still skeptical but there was also still a part of me wondering if I was completely losing my mind. The idea of my roommate wanting to eat me would seem very bizarre if I hadn’t been talking to an octopus since I’ve been living with him. Maybe I’m just going nuts thinking an animal is going to talk me into attacking someone like the son of Sam killer. \n\n“Okay,” I said. Very funny joke but let’s get past this. Come on man. Let’s play some Connect Four or something.” \n\n“Look under his mattress. Between the mattress and box spring, you will find a large knife. You’ll also find a bottle of sedatives in his top bedside drawer. That’s what he uses.. his plan will be to sedate you at dinner. Once you seem woozy enough, he’ll attack with the knife. If you don’t believe me, go in there and see for yourself.”\n\nI figured I might as well go look since I had already entertained all of this craziness and Mike was passed out drunk on the couch.\n\nI quietly entered his room. The door creaked loudly, but didn’t seem to wake him. After looking back to make sure he was still sleeping, I lifted up the mattress. Sure enough, there was a knife between the mattress and box spring. \n\nI then went over to his bedside table and opened the top drawer. It was full of miscellaneous junk but after looking through it for a minute, I found a bottle of Rohypnol and a bottle of Klonopin. \n\n“You need to tell me if you’re messing with me,” I said to the octopus. \n\n“I’m not. I wish I was. Get the knife.”\n\n“What does it matter?!” I yelled (mentally). “He can just get another knife!” \n\n“No,” the octopus said. “He’s very ‘OCD’ about it. That knife is special to him. If he can’t find it, it will buy us some time.” \n\nI was confused and nervous. I had already been dealing with the idea that my mind was melting. Now I have to worry about becoming my roommate's dinner. I bet he would overcook me too. Just seems like that kind of guy. \n\n“Stick the knife behind my tank,” the octopus said. “There’s some space on the table between the back of the tank in the wall. If he comes near it, I will move in front of it so he doesn’t see it through the glass.” \n\nI started panicking and did what the octopus said. I placed the knife on the stand behind the tank. There was about an inch and a half of table behind the tank and the gap between the table and the wall. Along with the other clutter on the tank, it did seem to hide the knife well.\n\n“I gotta call the cops!” I said. \n\n“They won’t do shit if you don’t have evidence,” he replied. \n\n“Is there evidence? What can I do?” I asked as I panicked a bit. \n\n“Just act normal around him. When he sees that the knife is gone, it will get his mind on his crimes. I will be able to read his mind and if there’s evidence in the house, he will think about it. Then I can tell you where it is. After that you can call the cops and we can both be freed.”\n\n“It’s gonna be hard to act normal,” I exclaimed. “Nothing about this is normal!”\n\nThe octopus replied, “Just because you aren’t aware of something, doesn’t make it abnormal.”\n\n“Kind of like an octopus being able to read minds and communicate telepathically?” \n\n“Yeah,” he laughed. “Kind of like that.” \n\n“So what do we do now?” I asked.\n\n“Just hangout. Go to work tomorrow like normal. You guys have staggered schedules tomorrow so he will be home when you aren’t and he will look for the knife and realize it isn’t there. Then I will just listen and wait until he thinks of something that will incriminate him. Until then, I’d love to watch some TV.”\n\nI was freaked out and my instincts told me I should just get out of the house. There was something about the octopus though. Whether it was real or in my head, I felt a genuine connection. \n\nI decided to stay. I left my door open and turned the TV on. \n\n“What is this show?” He asked.\n\n“Oh they’re crab fishermen..” I replied. \n\n“What’s the show about?” he asked. \n\n“Crab fishermen.” \n\n“Is that it?” He asked. \n\n“Pretty much. They throw crab traps into the water and pull them up. It’s been out for damn near 20 seasons.” \n\n“How could that be entertaining for 20 seasons?” He asked. \n\n“Well, they play intense music right before it goes to the commercial break so you think something exciting is going to happen when they come back.”\n\n“What happens after the commercials?” \n\n“Nothing. They just.. continue fishing for crabs.” \n\n“This is popular?” He asked. \n\n“Yep”\n\n“So.. You get why we want the human race to end. \n\n“I do..” \n\n“Don’t worry about it buddy. You’re on our side now. You’ll probably be long gone by the time we actually take over anyway. Although after seeing some of these television shows and news programs, I'm starting to think we can do it a lot quicker than we originally thought.”\n\n“That’s comforting,” I said. \n\n“Now can we see if there’s anything on tv other than critter murder?” \n\nAfter putting something else on TV, I fell asleep pretty quickly despite all the anxiety going on in my head. I found myself wondering if the octopus could see or hear my dreams as well. What else were they capable of? And of course there was still the lingering question. Is this actually happening? I didn’t know if mental illness was the most palatable reason it could be happening, but it was probably the most likely.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, Mike had already left for work. I went straight to the octopus tank. \n\n“Ya slept in long enough,” the octopus said. \n\n“What’s the plan here, man? I’m gonna feel really uncomfortable coming back here if what you said are his true intentions.”\n\n“He didn’t check for the knife before he left. He will when he gets back though.”\n\n“How do you know that?” I asked.\n\n“Because he does it everyday.. he just kind of holds it and looks at it and rubs it against his arms and face a little bit. He’s a weird guy. Anyway, he will realize the knife is gone and it will put his mind on his crimes. Knowing him, he has some sort of keepsake from those crimes. If he thinks about where they are, I will know, and we will have our evidence.”\n\n“Haven’t you been with him for a while? Haven’t you read his mind before? Why don’t you already know where they are?”\n\n“First off, I'm not with him. I’m his captive. Second, I don’t really like spending time in his mind. It’s a fucked up place. Now I have a reason to be there though. I just need you to make me a promise.”\n\n“What’s that?” I asked. \n\n“Let me be free.. don’t let the cops send me to a zoo or something. Get me out of here before you call the police. I could stay with you until we figured something out.. if that would be okay.. Or just dump me in the ocean. Just please don’t leave me here to become a captive of someone else.” \n\n“I promise.” \n\nI got my stuff together and prepared to head off to work. I was a bit panicked and kept forgetting things. \n\n“Calm down,” the octopus said. “He won’t be back for a few hours. You’ll be fine. We got this.”\n\n“Okay..” I said after a deep breath. “Good luck, buddy..”\n\n“Oh I don’t need luck,” he laughed. “I could use some tunes though. You mentioned a Bluetooth speaker?” \n\nI grabbed the speaker from my room and connected it to my laptop. He asked me to set it up against the tank so he could feel the vibrations. \n\n“Here ya go,” I said. “I’ll put on something bumpy for ya.” \n\nI put on a playlist that I had previously made for him. Just a lot of bass heavy music. I set the speaker against the tank, and I headed off to work. \n\nIt was impossible to focus on anything else throughout the workday. I kept telling myself that I shouldn’t have moved the knife. He’s going to notice and know that I went through his room and his stuff. He might attack me sooner because of it. Maybe the octopus was setting me up all along. Maybe I am just completely insane. \n\nI spent the day debating in my head which of those would be the worst of the possible scenarios. My heart raced continuously throughout the day. I kept taking trips to the bathroom just to try to catch my breath.\n\nAfter the workday ended, I didn’t want to go home. I was afraid. I didn’t know if I should arm myself in case Mike attacked me. I didn’t know if I should just head to the hospital and check myself into the psychiatric unit. My mind was all over the place, but I knew I had to go back to the house. \n\nWhen I got home, I sat in the driveway for a few minutes. I saw Mike’s car in the driveway and knew he was there. I figured that he probably had noticed his knife was missing. It took a few minutes, but I worked up the nerve to go into the house.\n\nIt was quiet when I walked in. The first thing I noticed was the smell coming from the kitchen. It smelled good. I walked in there and saw food cooking on the stove which was unusual considering that Mike hadn’t made anything more complicated than a hot pocket throughout the time I had been there. \n\nThe fear of Mike attacking me was weighing heavily on my mind, yet I still was trying to convince myself that I had just gone crazy. I certainly wasn’t excited about either possibility. \n\nI saw that Mike wasn’t in the kitchen or in the living room. I started walking toward his bedroom door to knock and see if he was home when I noticed the tank. \n\nIt was cloudy and dirty so much so that I couldn’t even see into it. As I want to take a closer look, I heard a noise coming from the bathroom. The door was partially ajar. I slowly approached. I lightly knocked on the door and called Mike’s name. There was no response. \n\nI began to push the door open and Mike burst out of the bathroom in a frenzy. He ran right past me with his arms flailing wildly. I followed him into the living room as I watched him make these bizarre movements like swinging his legs and arms around in different directions. I thought he was having some sort of seizure or stroke.\n\n“What’s going on!” I shouted.\n\nMike looked at me, then looked away, then continued flailing his arms in a very bizarre manner. He looked like he was struggling to speak, but eventually managed to get a few words out.\n\n“Help!” He screamed in agony. “It hurts! Please!!” \n\nHe then began to stutter. He continued to try to shout for help, but it was like he wasn’t able to force the words out. His screams of pain and pleas for help quickly turned into a nonsensical bumbling. Just a “pu pu pu” noise that sounded like he was trying to speak but wasn’t able. \n\nI started searching my bag for my phone to call an ambulance when I heard a familiar voice.\n\n“Frank! Don’t call em,” \n\n“Cthu.. octopus? Is that you?” I asked (mentally).\n\n“Yeah,” it responded. “Hold on. I’m trying to get the hang of this thing.” \n\n“The hang of what?! What the hell is happening?!” \n\n“We did it, Frank! Just hold on.” \n\nI watched in horror as Mike struggled and periodically forced out a plea for help. His torso started bending forward and backward frantically and the only words he was able to muster were help, hurts, please.. \n\nI tried talking to Mike but simultaneously I was trying to think out loud to the octopus.\n\n“What’s happening!” I screamed again. \n\nThere wasn’t a response for another minute or so. The wailing and pleas for help from Mike started to slow down as well as the frantic movements of his limbs. Eventually, he fell to his knees and sat there motionless. He moved his gaze from the floor up to me making eye contact. His eyes were red and watery from tears but the look on his face was content. I asked again what the hell was happening before hearing the voice in my head. \n\n“We did it!” the voice said.\n\n“Did what?” \n\n“Escaped!” Mike excitedly replied. \n\nMike started looking at his hands and clenching his fists and releasing slowly. He started touching different parts of his body and looking around in a very bizarre fashion. Then I heard the voice of the octopus again.\n\n“I’m in here, Frank. I’m in Mike.”\n\n“Can you please explain to me what I’m seeing?” I asked yet again.\n\nMike started moving his jaw around in a bizarre fashion like he had a mouth full of peanut butter. He cleared his throat and started to speak.\n\n“It’s me,” he said. \n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“The octopus. Remember when I said that we were capable of things that humans weren’t aware of? This is one of them.” \n\n“And what is this?” \n\n“I’ve taken control of Mike’s body. He wasn’t using it for anything good. He’s a dangerous man. I’ll make much better use of his body than he did.”\n\n“Is he dead?! What the..”\n\nMike and/or the octopus interrupted me, saying to calm down. \n\n“I’ll explain everything, Frank. It’s gonna be okay.”\n\n“This doesn’t look okay!” I yelled. \n\n“Calm down,” the voice said. “Please, sit down. Let me explain.” \n\nI shouted again. “I’m not gonna sit! Why do I need to sit? Sitting down doesn’t make bad news any less bad!” \n\n“It’s me. It’s the octopus, Frank. I have taken control of Mike’s body. I’m free now.” \n\n“What about Mike?” I asked as I tried to catch my breath. \n\n“He’s still in there. He just doesn’t have control. I am in control of his body now. He will remain alive and aware, but he will be stuck in the vessel that I will now control.”\n\n“That’s fucking horrible!” I yelled. \n\n“I know,” he replied. “It’s almost like being stuck in a tank for years and never being allowed outside of it..” \n\nI sat down. Maybe this was too much for a standing conversation. Mike was now speaking clearly, but I could simultaneously hear it in my head in the voice of the octopus. \n\n“He kept me trapped as a decoration. Intelligent species need to be stimulated. You can’t imagine what that felt like, but Mike can now.. I told you we were capable of more than humans knew. Do you think our plan was to just convince people through telepathy? We are among you. It’s so nice to be out of the tank and into a nice new shell. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but he deserves it and there’s the convenience factor.” \n\n“How did you even do this?” I asked in a panic.\n\n“With a little help from my friend,” he replied with a shit eating grin on his face. \n\n“What?”\n\n“You’re  going to love this,” he replied. “I’m pretty proud of myself. So, it started with the knife. I asked you to put it in a very specific position for a very specific reason. Same with the music. Although I really do prefer the bumpy music, it actually served a purpose. Having nothing to do all day but look around the clutter surrounding my tank, I got an idea. I wish you were here to see it work because it was just awesome!”\n\n“To see what work?” I asked.\n\n“My plan. The reason I kept asking you to adjust the speaker was because it needed to be in a very specific spot on the table. That’s also why I asked you to turn up the volume before you left. The bumpy music caused the table to shake lightly, but just enough to slowly move the knife that you had placed behind the tank. Eventually, the knife fell off the back of the table. This part was intense because it was the piece of my plan most likely to fail. But thank Poseidon that it actually worked! The knife landed on the cord of the self cleaning tank with just enough force to unplug it. I then waited for Mike to arrive home and squirted a jet of ink. When he realized something was wrong, he opened the tank for the first time since I’ve been in there. I then spoke telepathically to him for the very first time, causing him to look away from the tank and distracting him long enough for me to escape. Brace yourself because this is the gross part. I made my way to the bathroom and into the toilet bowl, knowing that Mike has a routine when he returns from work and it starts in the bathroom. I knew that even if I was missing, he would have to “sit down” before long. When he sat down, I made my move.”\n\nI felt a little sick as I listened to this explanation. I tried to interrupt him but he continued explaining.\n\n“I was able to quickly get up in there. It took me a little bit to get the hang of the controls, but I think I almost have it down. I’m very much more in control than he is and soon I will have total control of his body, AKA my new shell.”\n\n“That is beyond disturbing,” I said. \n\n“Oh come on! I’m like fuckin MacGyver!”\n\n“I mean.. yeah, that’s crazy that it all worked. I am just a little more focused on you being inside his body and referring to it as a shell.” \n\n“Frank, I am forever in your debt. I would’ve died in there if it wasn’t for you. As far as his unpleasant new circumstances, he did the same to me. He did a lot of bad things.”\n\n“He wasn’t a cannibal though, was he?” I asked.\n\n“No, but he is a total sexual predator. Why do you think he had roofies? I did fib about the cannibalism and murderer aspect, but it was necessary for the plan.”\n\n“You lied to me.. Are you going to hurt me?” I asked fearfully. \n\n“I did deceive you a little bit.. but I promise from the bottom of my hearts that I hate country music and the Applebees song more than I hate fishermen and living in captivity. I also promise that I would never hurt you. I do feel a bond with you. You saved me.. If my species takes over the planet before you’re gone, I will totally put in a good word for you.”   \n\n“Oh thanks, I appreciate that,” I said, unsure if I was actually being sarcastic or not. “The music and the games were all a part of your plan then?”\n\n“No. I thoroughly enjoyed our time together. I’m sorry I can’t stay and give you a chance to win one single game of connect four, but I’ve gotta get out there and help my brothers and sisters. I wasn’t lying about the music either. I like it bumpy.”\n\n“I don’t think I’m able to process this. If I’m losing my mind, will you just tell me.”\n\n“Your mind is perfectly fine. You just happen to know something that very few human beings will ever know. Frank. I’ll never forget what you did for me. Hopefully our paths will cross again someday. I have a lot of lost time to catch up on though, and it’s time for me to fly.” \n\n“Humans can’t fly,” I replied. \n\n“Not with that attitude,” he said as he headed for the door. \n\nIt seemed like he had complete control over Mike’s body by this point. There were still a few pleas for help breaking through but they were happening less and less frequently. \n\nHe tossed a few random items into Mike’s work bag, tossed on his coat, and prepared to leave for good. It was strange. I was horrified by what I just saw, but felt worse about losing a friend. \n\n“I hope you’ll stay in touch,” I said sincerely as I simultaneously realized how bizarre this all was. \n\n“We’ll see each other again, Frank. Maybe then, you’ll be able to beat me at connect four.. maybe.”\n\nHe jokingly told me I could keep the sedatives as he got to the door. We looked at each other for a few silent moments before saying goodbye telepathically. He started walking out the door before I stopped him to ask him one last question. \n\n“Your name!” I blurted. “You said you would tell me when you trusted me. What is it? It’s gotta be something weird right? Something like Glorp? Rampon? Condoleezza?”\n\nHe turned around, smiled, and said “Larry”.   \n\n“Oh come on!” I laughed. \n\n“I swear to Poseidon.” \n\n“Like you even believe in Poseidon,” I said. \n\n“Okay, Aquaman,” he jokingly replied. \n\n“Goodbye Larry.”\n\n“Goodbye dipshit,” he said with a smirk and a wink now that he had complete control of Mike’s body. \n\nAfter that, I just watched as he got into Mike’s car, figured out how to start it, took out a few mailboxes, then seemed to get the hang of it and headed on down the road. \n\nApologies if I did play a hand in the inevitable downfall of the human race at the tentacles of the octopus race. Who knows though. Maybe they will do a better job than we did..",

        "author": "MarineroRon",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11tcb36/i_am_an_agent_in_the_war_of_good_versus_evil/",
        "text": "My name is Shay, and I am an agent in the war of Good Versus Evil. I work tirelessly and selflessly to fight the demons and monsters that threaten the mere existence of humanity. It’s a job not without significant risks. That’s for sure. However, I sleep soundly every night knowing that I’m doing my part to help keep the world just a little bit safer.\n\nWell, truth be told, I might be exaggerating just a bit when I say the word ‘agent’. Technically speaking, I work in a weapons factory that manufacturers holy weapons that the actual angels and soldiers use to vanquish the evil entities. I’m more what you would call an….’assembly specialist’. At least that is what my cool boss Gary says to me.  \n\nSo, what is it that a heroic assembly specialist does? Well, I help assemble parts on a complex assembly line for a weapon that is instrumental in the Good fight. For security purposes, no individual ‘assembly specialist’ knows what the completed weapon looks like. We just assemble small parts that fit together at later stages of the process. The only thing that I know about the completed weapon is the name attached to it. \n\n**It’s called PROJECT HALO.**\n\nI wasn’t exaggerating though when I said that my job comes with significant risks. Several of my co-assembly specialists near me have recently been replaced suddenly. The replacements came in without warning and we never heard what happened to the replacements’ predecessors. I’ve never in my life worked somewhere with such frequent turnover. \n\nTake for example, Samantha. She used to work right next me on the assembly line of Good. Working next to people that you like always makes coming to work every day a real joy. That’s why when Samantha was suddenly replaced, it was a shocker for me. They even got rid of her special chair they had purchased for her to accommodate her slightly overweight form.  \n\nMy boss Gary said all the turn-over was due to burn-out. I supposed that was possible. The rumor though at the water cooler was that demons had been targeting workers at the facility to disrupt manufacturing. \n\nGary didn’t seem too worried about it. Whenever me or anyone else brought up to him our concerns about this or anything else, he would listen and smile with his impossibly handsome and cool smile and nod sympathetically. He told me not to worry. That definitely put me at ease.\n\nGary even joked to me in the section meeting that was attended by everybody that he promised he would not let me end up hurt like Jake over in section C. Jake suffered from a congenital issue that impaired his ability to walk without a cane. Gary then limped as he walked to the center of the room and spoke in lisp and said, “I promise, buddy. I will protect you!”. \n\nWe all laughed. Even Jake after a moment. After all, it was all in good fun. A close-knit crew of workers in it together for the good fight. Gary just had a way with people. So cool and smooth. It really was a pleasure to be working there. \n\nDespite every hardship and all the turn over, we were able to keep high spirits. In fact, one day, out of the blue, Gary came by my station to show me something interesting. He showed me a clip of Wendy from Section B. It was a picture of her from college in which she entered some bikini modeling contest. She would be so embarrassed if she knew I saw this. We both said “Nice” and fist bumped each other.\n\nUnfortunately, a week ago an attack hit one of the managers from Section L. It happened right outside the facility in a brazen attack by demon sympathizers. The manger, Mrs. Astrid, was severely injured by the attack. I only saw a flash of her as she was wheeled through the entrance in an emergency stretcher. Apparently, the demon sympathizers wrote “Revenge!” in blood across her car. \n\nI couldn’t believe that such a thing happened to the beautiful Mrs. Astrid. It was somewhat alarming an attack happened so close to the facility, but I didn’t let it deter me. I kept my stiff upper lip and carried on, as my great grandfather would say.\n\nOne thing though that does still scare me is the thought of running into the mega demons called The Vexatio. These demons are the demonic assassins that target the weak and cowardly. They were used to infiltrate weak points in the ranks of the army of Good. Their method of killing involved using their sharp teeth that protracted unnaturally outwards from their mouth to saw through their victims. Their attacks always accompanied by a saw-like sound and a shrill electronic scream that haunts any unfortunate souls that happens to hear it and live. \n\n\\--\n\n“You speak Dragonese, damn that’s awesome…”, Gary said to me one morning before we started our weekly meeting. I saw him come to the office in a brand-new European sports car. I figured it was beyond the means of most people but Gary must be doing really well for himself. Maybe he’s privately wealthy and does this work out of a sense of duty like me. I certainly don’t do it for the meager sum Gary is, according to him, begrudgingly forced to me. \n\n“Dude that is so awesome. Man, you better watch out, that is a powerful skill. People like that are the first to be killed over in Operations. I would keep that to yourself, buddy”, Gary said.  I don’t know how it came up exactly but I mentioned that I had a skill for picking up languages. I supposed I was just trying to impress him. I told him how I acquired the demonic language Dragonese from a very brief study as a hobby.  \n\n“Wait, do you think I could be useful to the Good fight outside of assembly?  Gary, I would do that in a heart-beat, if I could. Could you do a recommendation for me to Operations?”, I asked. I was legitimately excited about the possibility of contributing more to the fight for Good.\n\n“Yeah, sure thing. Tell you what. Why don’t you wait and sit on this information for a few days so I can make a few calls. I’ll take care of everything”, Gary said flashing one of his cool smiles. Damn, the guy can do no wrong.\n\nThis was actually happening, I thought. I was going to be an actual agent! I was so excited that I just can’t sleep that night when I got home. Tomorrow I would hopefully be speaking to a member in Operations and could start my training.\n\nI was just about to fall asleep when I heard something. A scratching noise just outside my bedroom window, followed by a metallic whirling saw-like sound and a haunting electronic scream.",

        "author": "BurntSchmidt",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11t89qj/what_happened_to_mr_lucas/",
        "text": "I worked security at the Gable-Waterman Buildimg downtown on Fifth South Street.  I knew Mr. Lucas for twenty-five years then.  Often, he would make late night visits for office work.  Well, I was finally reaching my golden years, grinding out the last years in security industry, which I'd swam around in for forty years.\n\nOne night, very late or very early, Mr. Lucas came into the building.  We were on such informal and friendly terms that I often would withhold demands that he even sign in.   Everybody liked the amiable Mr. Lucas.  Some even joked that with his tan skin, bright teeth, and golden hair, he was Odysseus incarnate. This night, however, something was different about him.  He came in, dressed as usual in a $1,500 suit, and passed by me without even saying 'hi'.\n\nHe looked forward, then back, then all around, and agaim, this routine repeating itself over and over for maybe three or four minutes; myself continually trying to communicate with him through a dark veil of complete indifference. He peeked through every window, mumbled and heaved, and went on chasing his tail.  His eyes were darker than usual. They bulged.  Almost seeming to need to cry. He looked like a worn-out, frightened spirit shoved into a suit. \n\nEventually, he got on the elevator, but the frightful languish of his eyes startled, even haunted me, then and there.  The way they seemed corked deeply into their sockets.  The wasted shadows around them.  The way he ignored me, but acted absolutely frantic, paranoid, irresolute, and how he had affected an expression of terror which could only have said to any eye \"they're coming to get me and I must escape\".\n\nAfter a while, I began to get concerned.  It only gnawed at me, only intensified more and more until I began to put together little shreds, for instance - he seemed only to be an image.  Much like an amorphous glob, which had conformed to his likeness, etched him as a three - dimensional entity, yet still remained a roaming shadow.  Sounds were missing, as if he were a muted television character jumped through the screen, the silence corresponding with his footsteps. The nonexistent musky scent and the nonexistent breeze as he flashed past me, and, finally, the nonexistent chime of the elevator.\n\nI called his office up on thirteen over and over.  I went outside and looked up at the building to catch a view of his office light overlooking the river.  It was pitch dark.  The entire floor was pitch dark.  Once I had rounded the corner of the building and approached the turnstile, I saw that it was still spinning as if just used.  He must have left.  That explained why his light was off.  He just needed to grab a thing or two, was probably stressed, and a tad moody.\n\nIn the morning, my boss approached me at my desk.  He asked if I had seen Mr. Lucas.  Mr. Lucas' wife was concerned, and so was his family.  The police had even gotten involved.  I told him, of which I assumed might have given them all a mighty sigh of relief, that Mr. Lucas came by last night.  My boss glinted and arched his brows at me with perplexity.  I asked him what was wrong.\n\n\"What's wrong, Jim?  You look kind of, I don't even know-\"\n\n\"Well, did the man say anything to you?\"\nI went on describing his bizarre actions in detail, which only succeeded in mystifying him even more.  \n\n\"Show me the footage.\"\nGladly, I did.  And from there nearly succumbed to asphyxiation through shock.  Clearly, I could be seen nodding.  Clearly, I could be seen speaking.  Clearly, the elevators had parted.  Clearly, finally, the turnstile had spun.  The common denominator to each of these acts was this - Mr. Lucas himself never once showed up in the footage.\n\nIn the end, police collided headlong into one roadblock after another until he was given up for dead, and he, his world, and his case all went cold.  I heard they had a mock burial for the man eventually.  Nothing of this typical, modern idealist of a man was so striking.  He wore a suit like others, went to work like others, and supposedly had a family like others.  There was nothing exceptional nor diminutive about him.  \n\nI don't know what I saw that night, but it seemed to conform to nothing and everything at the same time - vampirism, ghosts, demons...all I can say is that deep down, I knew that for a man so courteous, selfless and friendly to drop all of his most inherent, unconscious, inhibiting qualities like a ten ton anchor was proof - proof that something beyond the boundaries of all conceivable, tangential experience was happening to him.  \n\nWhat frightens me is that he looked so terrified.  What frightens me more is the mystery as to why *I* was the one to have been given the curse to see it.  I really, really don't want to die.  But now I'm aware of things I never was before.  Of eyes, of whispers stitched into the wind, of shadows that move and tease.  It's a prelude.  I know that this is true.  A prelude to running?  Hiding?  Or, perhaps, even pursuing.",

        "text": " My obsession with the obscure and unexplained had brought me to many peculiar places, but none as bizarre as the town I was about to seek. I stumbled upon a thread on another form dedicated to all sorts of paranormal phenomena, where they were discussing a town called \"Lockwood Hollow.\" It was said to appear at random, nestled deep within a dense uncharted forest, only to vanish without a trace as mysteriously as it had emerged. Intrigued and unable to resist the allure of the unknown, I resolved to discover Lockwood Hollow myself.\n\nI spent countless hours scouring the web, collecting pieces of fragmented information from dead accounts and compiling a rough map that should lead to the town's supposed location. Armed with an overstuffed backpack full of supplies and a drive fueled by insatiable curiosity, I set off on my quest to find the Lockwood Hollow, the town that doesn't exist.\n\nI arrived at what seemed to be the forest's edge, my body sending a shiver that ran down my spine, giving me all the confirmation I needed. The woods were unnervingly silent, the thick canopy above blocking most sunlight and casting a perpetual twilight. It was quiet, the only sounds accompanying me were of rustling leaves underfoot and the occasional caw of a lone crow in the distance. \n\nAfter several hours of trekking through the oppressive forest, I began to doubt the existence of Lockwood Hollow. I questioned my sanity, wondering if I was chasing a mere figment of someone's imagination. But as I was about to abandon my search, a ray of sunlight pierced the canopy, illuminating what looked to be a narrow dirt path. With renewed hope, I followed it and soon found myself standing on the outskirts of a small town, beside an old broken road sign that read “Lockwood Hollow.”\n\nThe town was a hauntingly beautiful sight, reminiscent of a bygone era with its Victorian architecture and cobblestone streets. Yet it was silent, eerily quiet, feeling completely devoid of any human presence. A palpable sense of unease washed over me, filling me with unease, but my curiosity urged me to keep exploring, to learn more about this forgotten place. And to find what caused its demise.\n\nI wandered the empty streets, hoping to find some semblance of life. As I continued to explore, I started to notice the deterioration of the town . Ivy had climbed up the walls and covered everything like a shroud, exposed rotting wood of a long-forgotten era beneath the once-vibrant paint that had faded and torn away. It appeared as though time had forgotten about this location.\n\nDrawn by an unexplained force, I found myself in front of an old, decrepit church. Its heavy wooden doors creaked open with a groan, revealing a dark, musty interior. Compelled to explore further, I cautiously stepped inside.\n\nThe church was abandoned, with everything coated in a thick layer of dust. The pews were overturned, as if knocked over during a rush, and the once beautiful stained-glass windows were cracked and shattered. Towards the back of the church, I noticed what looked like a massive book resting on a wooden pedestal near an old altar. As I approached, it was though the air seemed to grow colder, and an oppressive silence enveloped me.\n\nThe book was bound in ancient, weathered leather and held together by rusted metal clasps. Its yellowed pages contained a long list of names, each accompanied by a date. As I read the names, my blood ran cold: towards the bottom, I found that my own name was inscribed on the parchment, followed by today's date. I was in shock, I felt the weight of unseen eyes upon me, and the silent air was now filled with sinister whispers that echoed through the empty church.\n\nGripped by an immense feeling of terror, I fled the church, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I sprinted through the streets, desperate to escape this cursed town. But no matter how far or fast I ran, the town only seemed to stretch on endlessly, the streets and buildings blurring together, forming into a sick and twisted labyrinth.\n\nAs night descended, a dense fog crept through the town, limiting my vision and leaving me chilled to the core. The whispers grew louder and more menacing, and I sensed a malevolent presence lurking just beyond my sight, always at my heels. I knew I couldn't escape Lockwood Hollow, it was a place that wasn't meant to be found, a purgatory for those foolish enough to seek it.\n\nHours began to stretch into days, I found myself trapped in an endless cycle of fear and desperation. I wandered the fog filled streets, searching for any means of an escape, but nothing worked, the town had a life of its own, shifting and changing as if to taunt me.\n\nThe whispers never ceased, and at times, they seemed to morph into ghastly laughter or sobs that echoed through the damp air. Shadows danced at the edge of my vision, Lost soles? Or malevolent entities arriving to feed off of my sanity. \n\nSlowly, I started going mad, losing all sense of time and reality. The town that once was eerily  beautiful, had warped into something twisted and nightmarish, as if the very fabric of Lockwood Hollow was tainted by the darkness that enveloped it.\n\nIn my moments of lucidity, I scoured the town for clues, trying to piece together the mystery of Lockwood Hollow, and to just maybe, find a way out. I found journals and letters in abandoned homes, recounting the lives of the town's former residents. Each claimed of a once thriving community that had fallen victim to an unknown force, a malevolent entity, one that sought to consume the souls of those foolish enough to enter its domain.\n\nIt became clear that I wasn't the first visitor ensnared by Lockwood Hollow's sinister web, and I fear I will not be the last. I’m starting to feel as though I am left with two choices. Surrender to the darkness, or fight for my survival.\n\nAnd so, I write these words, my final account of the horror that is Lockwood Hollow. I will leave it pinned to the front door of this church. I hope that my tale will serve as a warning to those who would dare seek this cursed town. For whoever finds this, leave now! And hope that it’s not too late, and beware the lure of Lockwood Hollow, a place where the lost are destined to remain, trapped in a town that doesn't exist.",

        "text": "[Undulating Flesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/srx5yj/undulating_flesh/)\n\n \n\nGoing out for a late night drive, I find myself at a red light. The weather was nice and I didn’t have anywhere to be, so a nice little cruise to clear my head seemed like the right thing to do. I’ve had a lot on my mind lately, and a night time cruise sounded mentally satisfying.\n\nAfter all, I’ve been doing *so good*. No reason not to.\n\nAhead the traffic lantern sways in the breeze, the red glow beaming through its weathered lens. There’s no one else at the intersection, and the empty streets start to make me feel antsy. My palms start to sweat, and I readjust my grip on the wheel as I look around. \n\nTo my left, there’s a gas station. An old mom and pop looking place, with a single duo of pumps standing under a flickering light. When I look through the window, there doesn’t seem to be anyone working behind the counter. Maybe they’re taking out the trash?\n\nTo my right, there seems to be a bar that’s closed up for the night. The parking lot is empty, and their neon sign is shut off. I try to make out the name, but it's too dark. The sixth something. Maybe I’d have to come back some other time in the daylight and check it out.\n\nThe light ahead remains red. No matter, I’m not in a hurry.\n\nI crack my knuckles nervously, and turn on the radio. Some soothing music will do the trick. I tune the dial to find a station, watching the needle move on the dash as I navigate the static. The walls are meat. The needle wobbles back and forth, but nothing can really come through. I must be too far from the local stations. Something about the aggravated static makes me uneasy, and I feel myself start to sweat. \n\nI got to look at the red light again, and get distracted. Across the street there’s a fox walking in the grass, one that’s pulling a tiny leash behind it. It stops and looks at me momentarily, tilting its head in interest. Something about it makes me uncomfortable, and I feel the condensation of sweat on my brow.\n\nI rub my eyes, feeling the glimmer of a migraine behind it. It passes, and when I look down, I see a relief to the unending static on the radio.\n\nSitting in the cup holder is a cassette tape. It seems too good to be true.\n\nI grab the tape and look at it. It’s an old tape, one that looks like it's seen much use. Celine Dion’s “Falling Into You” album. Perfect.\n\nI look around the intersection, and see it’s still empty. I have time to put it in. At last, some kind of reassurance for this damn red light. I check both ways again, and lean over to put the tape in. The rectangular plastic of the cassette is satisfying. The crisp drag of it entering the deck is satisfying. \n\nI’m satisfied.\n\nAs the tape plays over the speakers, I feel myself relax. I’ve been doing so good. It’s better now. *I’m* better now.\n\nI sink into my seat as the piano intro starts, and I feel like I can breathe again. The music calms the buzzing in my head, and my nerves start to calm. Now if only the light would change, and I could get on with my peaceful drive.\n\nAcross the street, the Fox continues to look at me. I pay it no mind, and place my hands back on the steering wheel. It’s nice out tonight. Through the haze of the windshield, I look up at the red light. I don’t know why it refuses to change, but I’m patient. It’ll get there. It’s fine. Everything’s fine. I glance at all lanes of the intersection, thinking maybe a car is coming and I didn’t see it. That’s why it’s taking so long.\n\nThe streets are empty.\n\nThe streets are empty.\n\nThe streets are empty.\n\nI look nervously at the gas station to my left, expecting it to be empty, and it’s *not*. Something is standing behind the register. It looks like a man in a metal suit– like knight’s armor, horribly modified with a tail made of wires and computer parts—\n\n“No.” I whisper to myself, looking away. I’ve been doing so good, there’s no way it’s gotten away from me. It’s not really there, I know it’s not, so I look to the right and make sure—\n\nThe parking lot to the closed bar is no longer empty, something stands tall amongst the rows of painted lines. A large horse in a suit, human hands stapled where the front hooves should be—\n\n*“No.”* I say again, feeling a rush of bile in my throat. I swallow and keep it down, along with the murmur of the migraine that begs to return.\n\nI’ve been doing good, really. It’s fine, everything’s fine. It’s been fine for a while. Really.\n\nThe familiar cold sweat returns, hands clammy on the wheel. The song rises over the speakers of the playing tape, and I plead for it to comfort me as I look desperately at the red light. \n\nWhy won’t it change?\n\nWhy won’t it just change?\n\nI don’t want to do this, I *can’t* do this.\n\nAbove, the red light mocks me. Across the street, the fox mocks me. It looks at me in judgment, its face twisting as it looks like it’s trying to gag. Something behind it stirs in the trees, and I can faintly make out the outline of a large rack of antlers, and a writhing mass of slick tentacles—\n\n“Please! *Please!*” I beat my hands on the steering wheel, feeling myself crumble under the weight of it all. \n\nAbove, the light is red. Behind me, I see headlights for another car. I watch them in the rearview mirror, and I feel the welling of tears in my eyes. The hair on my neck stands straight. My armpits are moist, a stream of sweat drizzles down my temple. I want to feel for my phone, but I don’t think I have it. I don’t think I’ve had it for a while.\n\nBehind me the car slows for the red light, and pulls in the lane next to me. The car stops, the groan of another engine idling threatening my music. I don’t want to look at them, so I don’t. I don’t care who it is. I try to focus on the music but it's hard to hear it.\n\nI decide I’m going to run the red light. I mash the pedal to the floor but the car doesn’t move. I try again, and again, each time harder than the last. I look at the fuel gauge… and see I have no gas. Every warning light on the dash is on now, a collection of symbols telling me I’m not going anywhere soon.\n\nDeep breaths. You can do this, deep breaths. *Breathe.* You’ve being doing good, you been—\n\nAcross the street, the fox is vomiting what looks like a man. Tearing fur makes way for a head and naked body, a slimy face with eyes that open in time to look at me. \n\n***“Please.”*** I say again, looking away from the oral birth to the car next to me. The window rolls down, revealing two men in suits and close-cropped hair. They watch me wordlessly, eyes shielded behind sunglasses and a film of cigarette smoke that billows out. They say nothing, only watch, as the sound of my music fades away to nothing.\n\nNo—nonono*nonononono—*\n\nI try to turn the volume down but the radio explodes with noise, the sounds of a hundred screams filling my ears so loud it hurts. I scream against the noise, but it doesn’t stop. I hit the “stop” button, try to eject the tape–anything. The screams become too much, and I find myself tearing off my seatbelt and fleeing the car.\n\nOutside of the car, it is silent again. A fog is rolling in, one that wafts over the intersection until it's consumed by it. \n\nI look to the gas station for help, only to see the inside of it painted red. Inside the station a man in a hardhat is getting mutilated, watching me with a smile as a metal-alligator-human tears through his guts with gloves made of knives. The alloy abomination snarls and stomps the man on the ground, crushing both his skull and the hardhat with a large steel boot. Outside, a garbage truck rumbles to life at the gas-pump.\n\n*Please.* \n\nOver the crisp night air, I hear the *neigh* of the horse man. He’s closer now, standing on the side of the road. He downs what looks like a glass of whiskey, before squeezing it in his hand so hard it shatters. His unnatural hand runs the thumb over its fingers, shards of glass serrating the pale digits.\n\nAcross the street, the fox completes its purge. The naked man rises from the fetal position in the grass, standing tall and awkwardly with a face and eyes that look just like mine. Behind him the deer monstrosity emerges from the woods, a portrait of animal gore of all kinds shifting under a hundred reaching feelers. I turn to get away, to get back into the car, but when I turn around—\n\nMy car is gone. The men in sunglasses watch without emotion, their eyes bleeding from behind the sunglasses. After staring at me for a moment, they turn their heads in unison to face the intersection. The trunk of their car pops, and a clown climbs out with a wooden bat in his hands. He points past me with the club, in the same direction the men in sunglasses are looking.\n\n“Please, help me—”\n\nMy voice chokes when I follow their gaze, and I want to cover my eyes as the fog retreats in fast-forward.\n\nIn the intersection, there is no redlight. The pavement has crumbled in on itself, forming a crater where the street used to be. I don’t want to see it but I have too– I can’t look away. My feet move on their own, and I ignore the abominations as I focus on the gaping hole. It calls to me, and I can’t seem to resist its voice. \n\nI look down in the pit, wishing I could stop even as I lower myself to climb in. There’s something down there, and I need to see it. I make my descent, hands and shoes navigating the jagged concrete and twisted rebar as I blink away tears. As I near the bottom, the things from above gather around, each silently observing as I go deeper and deeper. I don’t want to go, but I don’t know how to stop. I scream at them for help and they ignore me. I curse at them angrily, shouting and pleading until I feel the purchase of flat ground beneath my feet. My breath shudders as I turn, but my body continues on autopilot to the center.\n\nLaying on the ground, is a Hawaiian shirt. The fabric is frayed and dirty, the floral pattern torn in multiple places. I reach down to grab it but it ignites into a ball of fire, stitches withering and turning black against the flame. Through the smoke of the smoldering shirt, a door materializes in the wall of rock. I don’t understand. I don’t *want* to.\n\nI want to cry but the tears won’t come. I look above for guidance and see the rim of the pit is outlined with a silent audience.\n\nThe naked man that looks like me. The standing horse in a suit, with stapled on hands. The men in sunglasses, bleeding from their eyes. The horror with the head of a deer. The metal alligator monster. \n\nIn unison, they point to the door. I don’t want to go, but I know I must. I need to see what they want to show me. Reluctantly, I head to the door. I hear the screams trying to get out, a chorus of pain and death and fear, all welcoming and warning. I feel an angry heat the closer I get, and the knob is hot to the touch. When I open the door, it feels like my skull is breaking in two. I step in and the door slams behind me, a momentary darkness transitioning to a single flickering light.\n\nBehind the door, the walls are meat. Gestating, *aggravated* flesh. They squirm and wiggle, arms reaching and eyes staring as I break before them. I shiver and hug myself as it all comes back to me, like a bomb detonating in the calm ocean that was my brain. I want to say I’ve been doing good, but I know it's a *lie.*\n\nI recognize the laundromat, even in its appalling state. Washing machines thrash on each side, the clanging of metal boxes squelching in the gore that has replaced the tiled floor. In the center of the room stands an old television on a cart, overgrown by tendons and sprouting teeth.\n\nAround me, everything screams. I look behind the glass of every agitating machine, and all I see is a mass of pounding limbs fighting to get out. Fingers and toes kicking and screaming, digits breaking against the glass. I want to be far away from here, back in the car on the open road. \n\nBehind me the door is gone, replaced by a stretch of skin and veins. The light goes out, and all I can hear is the convulsing of the meat, and the banging of the broken machines. In the darkness the walls come for me, and I can only cower and sob as they draw near. \n\nIn the dark, the television blinks to life. Even as I watch the walls close in and the writhing corridor narrows around me. The picture is old and grainy but I recognize the scene, like it's a movie I saw long ago. A man in a straight-jacket, kicking against men in white coats. The man thrashes inconsolably, even as they stick a needle in his arm. His eyes are bloodshot and dart around, and his hair is tossed and missing in places. But there’s an undeniable, sickening familiarity to him.\n\nHe shouts the same things over and over, and it all comes back to me as I make out the words. I mouth the words myself, the syllables feeling natural even as I sob.\n\n**I seem to have misplaced my pills.**\n\n**Somebody help me.**\n\n**Help me.**\n\n**Please.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[—AHS](https://www.reddit.com/r/HawaiianShirtFiction/comments/s1rwfv/online_story_archive/)",

Blood drips from his eyes down his cheeks. I take my keys out of my pocket and thrust them into the ignition. \n\nThe car splutters to a start. I turn to Michael, reaching over him and grabbing his seatbelt before clipping it in. \n\n“Michael,” I say, “Hold on.” \n\n“I’ll hold on...” he quietly says, a tremble in his voice. I flick the car headlights on. \n\nHarry stands right in front of the car, now illuminated by the headlights. He’s clutching the blood-stained scissors in his right hand, staring right through the car windshield. I freeze. \n\nHarry stares at Michael, confused. He slowly tilts his head to the right, then the left. The look of confusion on his face grows. Then, suddenly, as if he loses sight of Michael, Harry’s green eyes flutter and blink, before they dart to look at me. I squeeze my eyes shut. \n\nA long, low croak rings through the air. It starts quiet, but gets progressively louder. I open my eyes, and see Harry pointing toward me, his mouth open wide as he emits the low moan. I flick the car into first gear, and press hard on the accelerator, driving into Harry at such a force that it propels him into the air and over the back of the car. \n\nMichael whimpers  as I start to drive away from the care home. I look over to him, grimacing as I once again see the gashes left where his eyes once were. Blood covers his pyjama t-shirt, spreading down his boxers and bare legs. He’s clutching something – a piece of paper. \n\n“Michael”, I say, “what is that you’re holding?” \n\nJust as I ask, a ghastly screech fills the night air. It comes from behind us, from the care home. I look in the rear view mirror. In it, I see the dim outline of the home, getting ever further in the distance. I turn my eyes back to Michael, who still grips the paper, then back to the road. \n\n“Michael”, I pant, “can you speak to me? You said you knew what was happening!”\n\n “No!”, Michael exclaims, “I didn’t say that. I said I know it’s the lady that’s doing this. The woman in room one.” \n\nI glance in the rear-view mirror once more, the road between us and the nursing home has grown, the home now a blip in the distance. I gently press on the brake pedal until the car comes to a stop, and turn my attention to Michael once more. His grip around the paper is tight, but as I begin to take it off of him, it loosens. \n\nI hold the paper in front of me – it’s the same paper I had found earlier, the patient file for the woman in room 1. Except now, I can clearly read it. \n\nHer name is Anna Fletcher, as I glance to the small, black and white photo which is so clearly the woman in room 1. Her photo stares back at me lifelessly; despite the lack of colour I can somehow make out her green eyes. I read on. \n\n*1898.* \n\nThat must be wrong. It states here that she was checked into the home in 1898. That can’t be right. That’s over one hundred years ago. I read further. \n\n*‘Anna has come to us following complaints from the Church, which she has served for the majority of her adult life. Churchgoers have started to notice changes in her as she has aged, both physical and mental changes. As Anna’s sight began to deteriorate, she has become excessively jealous of those who still possess their sight, obsessively accusing them of ‘stealing her eyes’ from her. Due to a lack of family and of support, it is of the care home’s opinion that Anna, or Mother Anna, as she is widely known to the community, reside here for the remainder of her life or unless her condition, both mental and physical, drastically improves.’*\n\nMother Anna. The name of the care home - *Care of Mother Anna Nursing Home.*\n\n“She’s- ” I begin before Michael interrupts me. \n\n“She’s Mother Anna. It’s her.” \n\nI continue to read. \n\n*‘1900 – Since Anna has come to us, her condition has greatly improved. She appears more full of life and in a better state of mind. However, the biggest revelation and shock is the gradual return of her eyesight. It appears that she is quickly regaining her ability to see. However, it is of the care home’s belief that Anna has spread her past ideologies onto the other residents, as they have began to claim they cannot see, and are blaming Anna for their loss in sight’.* \n\nSuddenly, Michael begins to violently shake. His head bangs on the headrest of his seat as droplets of blood flicker from his face onto mine. He’s having a seizure, I suspect from his injuries, I need to get him to the hospital. \n\nI put Anna’s patient file down, and turn my attention to the road once more.\n\nAnd I can see her. \n\nI can see Anna, standing; no, floating, toward me from the darkness ahead. Her long, broken strands of hair float in the air as if through water. Her expressionless face illuminates from the shadows of the night as it gently floats closer to me, becoming clearer every second. The shimmer of her green eyes have locked into mine. Her eyes are so beautiful. I wish them to be mine. I am jealous that they are not. \n\n*They can be yours.* \n\nThe voice of an old woman croaks through my head. \n\n*They can be yours, Olivia.* \n\nMy eyes are changing now. I feel they are opening, wider than I’ve ever opened them before. I can see so clearly now. I can see Anna’s beauty. That’s all I can see. \n\nHer voice deepens. \n\n*Your eyes are becoming so beautiful, child.* \n\nMy hands reach toward the ignition, I feel the keys to the car on my fingertips. \n\n*Your eyes are opening.* \n\nI grasp the keys as my eyes stay locked with Anna’s. I grasp the keys tight.\n\n*You don’t need to be jealous anymore, child.* \n\nThe dancing shades of green seem to leap from Anna’s eyes, through the night sky and into mine. I pull the keys from the ignition. \n\n*I am here.* \n\nI hold the keys tight before thrusting one into my right eye. A surge of pain shoots through my body, and I feel Anna’s grip loosen. But she still has me. Blood pours from my eye as I yank the key out and half of my world plunges into a deep dark. \n\n*I am still here, Olivia.* \n\nI drive the same key into my right eye. I am plunged into darkness. \n\nBut I am saved from the green-eyed monster.\n\n-\n\nBeeping, beeping, beeping, all I hear is bloody beeping. \n\nI’ve been in hospital for a number of days now, I don’t know how many, strapped into this wheelchair. I’ve completely lost track of time. I just sit in my darkness, reliving the events of that night. \n\nNobody believes me. The doctors think I’m crazy. It’s all in the news, some people think I had something to do with the horrors that occurred at the nursing home, some people think I’m an innocent victim who’s lost her mind having witnessed them. But nobody believes me, nobody believes the truth.\n\nMichael was dead by my side when they found me in the car that night. Once I had pierced my eyes, all the noise, the chaos, everything stopped. Her voice in my head disappeared, the power I felt from her, all gone in an instant. \n\nThe rest of the residents were found dead, except for Anna. Except the woman in room 1. There’s now a manhunt on, the authorities trying to find her, trying to find this *poor helpless woman.* \n\n‘Elderly white female, frail, grey hair and green eyes’ is the description of her that’s being spread in the news. \n\nGreen eyes… \n\nI’m still being treated in the hospital, but from what I understand I’ll be transferred to a ‘secure facility’, in other words, a mental asylum. Some place run by a company called [‘MedVars’.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h8hrnc/im_staying_at_a_resort_for_people_who_are_taking/) But, for now, I’m sharing a room with a nice enough, elderly sounding lady. She chats about her injury to me, but I don’t bother about speaking to her about mine. She’s in with a doctor at the moment, murmuring to him about pain medications. \n\n“That should be you sorted”, I hear the voice of a male doctor. The kind and elderly woman thanks him and I hear him leave the room. \n\n“They never do get the medication right the first time”, the elderly woman exclaims, “the only thing that’s keeping me sane in here is that doctor! He’s incredibly handsome!” \n\n“Yeah?” I ask with a slight chuckle, “describe him to me”. \n\n“Well, he’s tall, has a lovely jawline, dark brown hair”, she starts, “but what draws me in is his eyes. They seem to, well, dance!” \n\nI stay silent for a moment, gulp, then gather my composure to ask, “His eyes?”\n\n“Well yes,” she laughs, “they dance around the room! They swirl around and absorb anything that they touch! They’re so beautiful and I wish they were mine! I wish they were everybody’s! Oh, how I wish you could see them! They’re the brightest shade of green, you see!” \n\nThe door opens and someone begins to wheel my chair out of the room. \n\n“If you could see them you could understand!” the elderly woman loudly chants, “you’d understand their beauty! You would be able to see their beauty!” \n\n“No- ” I stammer, “wait!” \n\n“But then again,” I hear the elderly woman speak, her voice distorted, “you can’t see. Can you?” \n\n“Stop!” I shout, not knowing where I was going or who was wheeling my chair, “Don’t look at their eyes! Stop!” \n\nI hear the elderly woman laughing in the distance as I’m wheeled away.\n\n-\n\n“That’s the woman just checked out of room 1!” I hear a nurse shout, as I [leave the hospital screaming.](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)",

        "text": "Y’all ever have a rich friend? One that casually drops stuff like “we should go to Dubai for the weekend,”or “where do you guys have your summer house?” Well, I had one, and his name is Josh.\n\nJosh is one of the genuinely nicest people I know, but sometimes he has difficulty understanding the plight of the regular dude. His parents are *old money.* They run a real-estate conglomerate spanning throughout the U.S, and have always hoped Josh would join their business and take upon his father. I’ve never met his dad, and sometimes I feel like neither has he - they didn’t spend much time together on account of work. I always pictured him as a monocle wearing, thick-mustached Mr. Monopoly that would rent out park benches for the homeless if he could. \n\nSome people have a white-picket-fence upbringing, but Josh had what I call the stone-walls-guarding-the-mansion kind. Most of his life he’d lived in a manor not dissimilar to the one Mr. Burns lives in. He even had a real life Smithers (yes, his real surname was Smithers, poor thing), whose whole entire job was to serve the family with whatever they needed.\n\nWe’ve known each other since we were kids. In elementary school, I played soccer for a small league, and that’s where we first met. Josh was homeschooled, but he’d begged his parents to let him play with the other kids after seeing footage of Cristiano Ronaldo, and begrudgingly they let him. We were a shitty team full of shitty, difficult kids, and part of me thinks Josh was put there as a lesson, his parents hoping he’d want to quit immediately after hanging out with the lower class; they had the money and connections to put him into a team that didn’t practice on an unkempt field outside that was half grass and half mud. To their disappointment, Josh *loved* it, and slowly, everyone came to like him as well.\n\nFor his first practice, he’d come in wearing a Burberry cardigan, chinos and leather loafers. Everyone made fun of him, but Josh tried his best, although he obviously had never kicked a ball in his life. It was a rainy day, and by the end of the practice his loafers were crumpled and torn, his cardigan muddy and unrecognizable. I remember chuckling at his get-up, sure that this was the first and last time we’d be seeing Josh the rich kid.\n\nTo our surprise, he came back the next week. This time, he was sporting the most expensive and fancy soccer gear one could get: football boots worn in the previous World Cup by Argentina, as well as custom shorts and a shirt designed by Ronaldo himself. Everyone was jealous and bitter at Josh - some kids couldn’t even afford real soccer boots of any kind. Defying the odds of him getting instantly beat up, he walked up to the changing room doors where we were hanging out and opened his puffed up duffel bag. Inside, he had a Ronaldo shirt for everyone. He handed each kid one while apologizing that he couldn’t get them the whole outfit. \n\nWith that, most kids came to accept him as one of ours. Some still had their doubts, but as Josh came back time and time again, and although he was never going to be Ronaldo, he tried and practiced as hard as anyone else until he secured his place in the team. During this time, I came to like his awkwardness, and I guess he liked that I did things with him that no one else did. We started hanging out outside of practice, and I taught him how to fill up water balloons and ride a skateboard. We watched MTV together and tried to recreate Jackass stunts we saw on TV. I won’t lie, as a kid I definitely enjoyed the fact that he could get basically anything he wanted whenever we wanted, a superpower which we used to our full advantage, sending Smithers to buy us candy and video games and action movies whenever we felt like it. Our parents weren’t the most present, his mom and dad always traveling for work, and mine just not being very attentive, so we got to do as we pleased for most of the time. In hindsight, I think Smithers felt bad for us, and that’s why he was willing to get us (almost) whatever we wanted.\n\nJosh became my best friend. We hung out almost every day, Smithers either bringing him over to play in my neighborhood, or him coming to pick me up and take me to Josh’s place, which was the *size* of a neighborhood. He’d always help me - or whoever else he could - with whatever, using his resources to do good instead of hoarding them. He might not have understood what it’s like not to be megarich, but he wanted to help others any way he could.\n\nYears later, it was time for us to go to college. Obviously, with that kind of money and a surname like Walton, Josh got to go to an Ivy League school, while I went to a middle-class college half a state away that I could barely afford. He offered to pay for my tuition, but I couldn’t say yes. It was too much, and I’m sure his parents wouldn’t have been too pleased about that either. \n\nWe kept in touch mostly online, but college life kept us both busy and the distance made it so we didn’t see each other often. I could notice that he was hanging out with other rich kids. When I’d ask him what he’s up to, he’d text me things like “going 2 Paris with some girls'' or “staying at spa-hotel for weekend, hungover lol.” Meanwhile, as I worked as a food courier during nights, I started feeling bitter and jealous, like I had when I’d first met him on that muddy soccer field. The fact that he was rich and from a family that’s slowly acquiring the status of household name was becoming more apparent by the day. We texted less frequently and spoke on the phone only occasionally.\n\nOne day Josh called me up out of the blue. I didn’t exactly feel like hearing more tales of expensive champagne, trips to Europe, or frat house hijinks, but I took the call anyway. I thought I’d just make up an excuse if he started to go off on tangents regarding his awesome life.\n\n“Hey, man. It’s been a while,” I said as I pressed the phone to my ear, ready to roll my eyes.\n\n“Hey, uhh.. Yeah, it has,” he replied, his voice sunken.\n\n“Is everything alright Josh?”\n\n“Yeah, no, everything’s fine. Listen. I know we haven’t exactly been talking much recently. That’s my fault -- I’m sorry. I might’ve gotten a bit carried away with this college thing.”\n\n“Yeah, you might have,” I said teasingly, a chuckle escaping my lips.\n\nThere was a pause, like he was thinking over what he was about to say.\n\n“I want to get away for a bit, clear my head. Thought you might want to join me. There’s this old hotel my parents are trying to sell, but it’s gonna be empty for at least a couple months longer. It’s renovated to be like a house, at least from the inside - they’re gonna redo the exterior later. There’s like cinema rooms, a bunch of bedrooms, an indoor pool, the works, really. I know it’s not really your scene, but it’s smack dab halfway between our schools. Should be about a six hour drive for both of us. And with spring break around the corner, we could stay there for a while.”\n\n“You’re not gonna do spring break? I thought that was a huge thing there. Or maybe you’d be taking a flight to Paris or London with your frat buds, be an alternative kid.”\n\n“Okay, okay, I get it, call Jello Biafra so he can scream at me about how I need to take a holiday in Cambodia.” \n\nJosh paused for a moment, then continued, enunciating his words clearly with a stern tone, which he always did when he wanted me to take him seriously. “I’m tired of that shit. I need some time away to think, and I’d really love to talk to my best friend while I’m doing that.”\n\nJosh seemed genuinely concerned and serious, and it was obvious he’d thought this whole thing out. For a moment I felt bad for teasing him, but hey, that’s what best friends do, right?\n\n“I’ll need to cancel some plans, but I think I could spare a week at least,” I replied, knowing full well that I had absolutely no plans for spring break.\n\n“Great. I’m glad to hear it. Hey, I gotta go, but I’ll text you the address if you wanna snoop the place out beforehand. Let’s talk soon to figure out the details, ok?”\n\n“Sounds good. Thanks for calling, Josh. I appreciate it.”\n\n“I’ll try to do it more often,” he said with a light chuckle, sounding relieved that I’d agreed to his plan.\n\nAfter the call, Josh texted me the address and a link to a website that showcased the property and its history. The hotel was reportedly built between the late 1800’s and early 1900’s. The faded building was shaped like a long rectangle, boasting four floors and intricate stone detailing. There were pictures of the hotel from its heyday, its paint bright and fresh, windows crystal clear, flowering bushes rimming the entrance in trimmed formations. In one of the pictures, smiling people walked about the property as staff migrated guests’ belongings in large, golden racks that moved on wheels. \n\nTwo weeks later, as spring break officially started, I drove up to the hotel and rolled up next to Josh’s Bentley, which was parked near the entrance to the property, some distance away from the hotel. *Well that’s new*, I thought, looking at the shiny black car with jealousy as I got out of my clunker. As I walked towards the building through the main road it invoked no feelings of grandiosity or luxury like it had on the website. Instead, it looked like a mausoleum; a tomb for something long lost. The ground was filled with concrete where bushes had been, and the exterior of the building seemed to crumble, evident by giant cracks and mossy, wet patches strewn about. What paint remained was faded, and mostly the building was an ugly gray, unfit for the springtime seeds wafting in the air through fresh rays of sunshine.\n\nJosh opened the large, wooden double doors in a dramatic, two-handed push as I walked up the cracked steps. \n\n“I’m terribly sorry sir, but we are fully booked. If I may suggest so, there’s a rancid cottage just down the street where you could stay the night, fit for a misfit like yourself indeed!”\n\n“I’m actually booked for the king suite, courtesy of m’lord Sir Josh Walton. Haven’t you heard of my name, boy?” I replied in jest.\n\nDropping the act, Josh took me into his arms and hugged me tightly, pressing down on my bladder.\n\n“Good to see you, Luke. I'm glad you could make it.”\n\n“I still need to make it – *to the bathroom that is* \\- you’re squeezing the piss out of me Josh,” I said, it occurring to me that I hadn’t taken a bathroom break through the whole drive.\n\n“Shit, sorry,” Josh said, loosening his hug. “There’s a bathroom just down the hall, first door on the left.” I skittered off awkwardly to the lavatory.\n\nAfter I relieved myself, I found Josh standing in the main hall that opened up from the entrance. Above him hung a chandelier the size of a small car, and directly in front of him stood what used to be the receptionist’s desk. Mirrored on both sides of the desk were two elevators, as well as a door leading to a staircase.\n\n“Welcome to the Carlton hotel!” Josh shouted as he saw me enter the hall, spreading his arms in a dramatic fashion.\n\nI obliged to Josh’s offer of a grand tour, which wasn’t too long as much of the building was still completely empty, and seeing as it used to be a hotel, most rooms were completely identical - not much to see. He said that the building was basically a mirror image of itself, the two halves exactly the same for the most part.\n\nThe first floor was stuffed with all things grandiose: a large dining hall that connected to an industrial-sized kitchen, a social room with a fireplace and tables set for board games, as well as staff and storage rooms that were renovated and combined into a large gym. Next to the reception there was a small bar area with a few leather chairs and tables. The pool, which was supposedly nearly as long as the ones they use for the Olympics, resided in the basement, which we didn’t take a look at after Josh implied we’d be taking a dip later on.\n\nThe second floor held mainly bedrooms, most fully furnished “to attract buyers,” as Josh said. We only checked out the left-side corridor, where our rooms were. The first door on the right was where he was staying. All of the rooms were along a wide, long corridor with no discernible differences at any point. They’d renovated everything to look modern, but some parts of the original hotel were kept as is.\n\nFor example, the floor still boasted a patterned red carpet throughout, as well as golden railings along the walls that kept the carts from scratching and bumping at the walls and baseboards. Along the way Josh showed me which door led to the bathroom. “It’s the middle door on the left hand side, so if you don’t want to check each door, just count to four from either side,” he said as we walked past the halfway mark. As we reached the end of the corridor, he stopped and pointed his arm at the last door on the right as he leaned in for a deep bow, exclaiming “Your room, Monsieur.”\n\nThe bedroom held no attributes of the old hotel's decor. Instead, it had been renovated to look like a boring, white and gray bedroom fit for a country house owned by a millennial couple. There was a walk-in closet, as well as a bathroom, the layout probably not too dissimilar to how it had been before. \n\n“Looks nice,” I said to Josh as I threw my suitcase on the perfectly made bed, crinkling the smooth fabric. “What’s it gonna cost me?”\n\n“You know I have a throbbing pro bono for you, Luke.” Josh gave me a concerned look. “Wait -- you’re not seriously asking to pay for this, right?” \n\n“You never know. I thought maybe you’d finally be getting into your parents' business.”\n\n“Look, man… I know I’ve been a dick. But come on! You’re my best friend, for fuck’s sake -- I’d never ask you to pay for this. You need to know that, Luke. I’m serious.”\n\nI felt ashamed, pondering whether I’d taken the jabs I’d given him too far. “Yeah, yeah, I know. I’m sorry. Just been a bit stressed out is all, I shouldn’t take it out on you.”\n\nI gave Josh a smirk and continued “Maybe we’re even with the being dicks, now.”\n\nJosh chuckled, relieved as the tension we’d tried to resolve through jokes finally unraveled. “Well, I’ll leave you to settle in. Come find me at the bar downstairs when you’re ready.”\n\n“Ready for what?” I asked.\n\n“To have some rich people fun,” Josh answered, winking over his shoulder as he turned around to leave.\n\nOnce I changed and unpacked a bit, I met up with Josh at the bar. It was eerie to walk along the long corridors of the building all alone, the silence staggering for a place that used to house so many people.\n\nAfter Josh poured me a hefty scotch and we properly sat down, it was like everything went back to the way things used to be. We talked about everything that came to our minds: the girls and boys we’d dated, how annoying frat houses can be, the shittiest courses at school, how our families were doing, I mean *everything.* \n\nAt some point we’d both unloaded our thoughts and feelings enough for the night, or perhaps our blood alcohol levels had just spiked to a level where sensible conversations were impossible to uphold. I was glad to have him back, and I hoped he felt the same way.\n\nWe decided to take a midnight dip in the pool, which was arguably *not* the smartest idea for two drunk college students. After changing to our swimming shorts, we descended the concrete staircase down to the basement.\n\nThe pool hall was just slightly larger than the pool itself, with small dressing rooms opening up on one side. Faux wood paneling decorated the walls and ceiling, most likely kept intact from a renovation done in the 70’s. The room glistened as light reflected from the tiny waves on the surface of the water.\n\nI jumped in first, cannonballing my way to the bottom of the pool. As I came up, I saw Josh taking the final strides preceding his jump. During that small flash, I finally took a real *look* at his body. Although he’d gotten a bit rounder on account of the frat house lifestyle of beer and pizza, he looked adorable, yet manly. His shoulders were defined, and a small line of hair that I hadn’t ever seen before trailed down from his belly button until it disappeared into his shorts. A moment later he was in the pool, the impact from his jump splashing water into my eyes, washing away the image.\n\n“Pretty nice, eh?” Josh said as he came up for air.\n\n“Is this that rich people fun you were talking about?”\n\n“No,” Josh said as he swam back to the edge of the pool and pulled himself up with his arms. \n\nHe walked up to a wall panel and held his hand over it, reveling in the anticipation he’d instigated. “This is.”\n\nJust as the words left his mouth, he pressed a button that replaced the regular lights with coloured disco lights that swirled and moved around the room. Two small disco balls emerged from hidden panels in the ceiling on both ends of the pool, reflecting the lights all the more. The cherry on top was the music: speakers hidden throughout the room started to play Earth, Wind &amp; Fire’s hit song Boogie Wonderland.\n\nI burst out laughing. The sight was completely surreal, as much ridiculous as it was purely *fantastic*. The water reflecting the coloured lights along with the disco balls produced a psychedelic light show that resembled a coarse mist that covered the room in flashing, swirling rainbows.\n\n“What the hell is this?” I asked Josh, my head spinning around in awe as I giggled like a schoolgirl.\n\n“A gift from the 70’s. They don’t know *who* built it, *why* they built it, or *who* they built it for. All I know is my dad had to do some jedi mind tricks for my mom to let him keep it as is.” Josh jumped back into the pool with a wide grin plastered proudly on his face. \n\nWe danced and drunk-boogied in the water to a few more 70’s jams until we tired ourselves out, deciding to call it a night. We shut off the disco machine, dried ourselves off and went up to the second floor.\n\n“Sleep well, Boney Mmm...” Josh trailed off as he stumbled through the door and fell on his bed. \n\n“Good night, Rasputin,” I replied, my intoxicated brain convincing me that the quip made perfect sense on multiple levels: a) relating to Boney M’s song b) the distant Russian relatives that Josh had, c) his status as part of a rich family, and d) his apparent luck with the ladies. I doubt it made sense on a comedic level, though, and Josh was practically passed out be the time his head hit the bed.\n\nI walked in zigzags to my room. Much like Josh, I plummeted on my bed and fell asleep in an instant, still wearing my swimming shorts.\n\nI woke up to hearing scratching above me. As I turned on the bedside lamp, I got a splitting headache; the scotch was coming for payback. I checked my phone for the time, which was a bit after 3 AM. Then I heard it again: scratching above me, in the ceiling, to my left. I sat up on the bed and held my head, hoping it’d relent with its painful throbbing.\n\n*Thump*\n\nI looked up. *Something was in the ceiling.*\n\n*SkrrrRRThump*\n\nSounded like it moved to the hallway.\n\n*thump*\n\nIt was moving further away.\n\nFiguring that the noise was a rat or possum or something, I got to my feet and tried to find something to use to shoo the animal away. Critters finding their way inside the house was a reality I’d lived through as a kid. Our house wasn’t exactly airtight, and we lived near some woods that were infested with raccoons. My experience was that you just needed to get them out before they shat all over the floors. \n\nBy sheer automation stemming from those years living in an impromptu zoo, I found a small broom and dustpan set in a closet. “Good enough,” I surmised in a croak to myself, the taste of scotch still uncomfortably present in my dry mouth. Leaving the dustpan behind, I wielded the broom and entered the hallway, ready to send the bugger off.\n\nSomething I hadn’t noticed during my drunken stumbling was the ambient lighting throughout the hallway. It was much dimmer than it had been in the daytime, and the lights must’ve come on automatically for the night. I felt like I was staring into a dimly lit shadow, the red carpet seeming shaggier than usual under my bare feet.\n\n***THUMP***\n\nThe sound came from behind the third room on the right, evident by the door's slight shake, like it had been the victim of a tiny earthquake that shook it on its hinges. I approached the room slowly, my grip tightening on the broom’s handle. As I walked up to the door, I heard no more sounds of movement. *It must have fallen in there,* I thought. *Nowhere to run.*\n\nWith the househusband’s ax in my right hand, I slowly opened the door with my left, posturing myself for battle.\n\nThe room was nearly empty, with no apparent signs of animalistic intrusions. The only thing the drab, windowless room had inside it was a jumble of plastic and cardboard storage boxes leaning erratically against the back wall. I started to carefully walk towards the boxes, tapping the broom on the floor in front of me like a blind man with their white cane, hoping to alert and flush out whatever creature hid among the boxes.\n\nAs I came up to the stacks of boxes, all remained still and quiet. Giving up on the stealthy approach, I put the broom down on the floor and started to move the boxes around, sliding them in different directions to check if something lurked behind them or within, hoping to scare out whatever it was that was hiding. \n\nFrom what I could tell, they’d dumped a bunch of the old hotel’s memorabilia into the boxes. Vintage bedside lamps, landline phones, and ice buckets were just a few of the items I saw as I rummaged around the piles of junk. To my dismay, nothing jumped out or sprinted away in fright. I took a few steps back and reassessed the mountain of boxes, trying to figure out where the creature might be. As I looked up, I realized where it had escaped. Right above the boxes in the far left corner of the room was a large hole torn into the ceiling.\n\nIt occurred to me that I hadn’t seen any food scraps, feces, or other indications of an animal among the boxes, so I decided to stack up some of them on top of each other and have a look inside the hole. If it has a nest or whatever up there, I could tell Josh the next day and he can just hire someone to come and evict whatever pigeons or raccoons lived up there - or ask them to sign a lease and make his father proud.\n\nThe cardboard boxes were too shoddy to stand on, but there were just enough of the plastic kind to build a small staircase of three steps. I leaned the boxes against the wall for extra support and tested their balance by shaking them around a bit. Satisfied with their structural integrity, I carefully put my right foot on the first box, ready to ascend.\n\nI kept my right hand pressed to the wall for support and made my way up to the third step, bowing down slightly as I could no longer stand straight against the ceiling. Aiming my head at the hole, I steadied myself into an upright position, which placed me shoulder deep inside the ceiling, the hole barely big enough to fit my torso in full. I couldn’t see more than a few feet in front of me, so I took out my phone from the shorts pocket, pressed the torch on and aimed it at the far wall inside the ceiling, illuminating the space surprisingly well.\n\nWhat I saw was not at all what I expected. Firstly, the ceiling had birchwood paneling throughout the ‘floor’. Secondly, it was high enough for an adult to crawl through with ease, the ‘real’ ceiling made of concrete standing almost four feet above. Thirdly, at the far end, there was a small latched door made of dark brown wood. In essence, it looked like a small version of the room below it.\n\nI stared at the space in confusion, completely forgetting that I was looking for animals, although there were no traces of anything having moved through there.\n\nI almost fell off the makeshift stairs when I started to hear crying. Loud sobs that almost reminded me of guffawing in their intensity echoed into the room through the hallway. It didn’t sound like Josh, the voice more feminine and light. \n\nI quickly jumped down and almost stood on my ankle, barely avoiding an accident. “Hello?” I asked the hallway, the cries sounding closer now that my head was no longer in the ceiling.\n\nWhoever was out there didn’t answer. As I made my way to the door the thought occurred to me that maybe there were in fact other people staying here that Josh just forgot to tell me about. Leaving out key information was one of his worst traits, often resulting in me getting super annoyed with him, and Josh perplexed as to my reasoning. He had some trouble… relating, sometimes. He liked to do first and think afterwards - I liked to assess, and if possible, produce a pros and cons list of doing before jumping to action.\n\nAs I stepped into the hallway, ready to help out whoever was there, the crying stopped, like it had never been there at all. Before I could ask myself *whatthefuckjusthappened*, I saw that the bathroom door to my right was open. A moment later, I could hear the shower start to run, its white noise emanating from deep within the room. \n\nI walked a few steps towards the room, stopped behind the open door and said “Hey, you left the door open! Uhh… I’m with Josh, the owner’s son. Uhm, he didn’t say there’d be anyone else here.” I gulped, realizing that this was going to be a very awkward encounter no matter how it panned out.\n\nThere was no answer, the shower splashing the floor in a steady, monotonous stream. “Are you okay?” I asked with my voice raised, hoping that whoever was there could hear me over the shower. “I heard someone crying, so just wanted to check that everything’s fine!” \n\nStill no answer. I circled the door to look inside. The bathroom was large, most likely done to fit a storage room from the building’s days as a hotel. On the left was a double basin, with arching, golden taps, and crystal knobs. Directly ahead was a wide shower stall fitted with opaque glass.\n\n“Helloo-oo?!” I asked, my voice returning in a miniscule echo through the white tiling. I started getting increasingly concerned, my thoughts racing as my mind seemed to sober up in a second. *What if they’re hurt? Slipped in the shower and hit their head? They’ve still not said a fucking thing, that’s NOT normal. go IN.*\n\n“I’m coming in, okay?” I said in a half-yell, and forced myself to start walking inside. As I reached the shower stall, I knocked on the door as my final warning. “Hey, you okay in there? I’m gonna open the door, okay?” The lack of an answer pulled me into action, preparing myself for the worst. I pulled the sliding door open in a jagged, quick motion, the adrenaline pumping in my veins.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe shower ran idly in the empty stall. Suddenly, I felt drunk all over again as doubt flooded my mind. As I stood there, staring through the stall, I couldn’t quite piece together a plausible explanation for what I had just experienced. \n\nWith nothing to cling to, the stress I had accumulated started to leave my body. My eyelids started to feel heavy, and the warm steam of the shower relaxed my body. Finally, using Occam’s razor, I concluded that I was just way too drunk and tired, and the only fix to such problems is to sleep it off. I turned off the shower, closed the stall door and turned off the bathroom’s lights as I returned to the hallway, ready to pass out for the second time tonight.\n\nIt took a considerable amount of strength to keep myself in a standing position as I saw what unfurled before me, the adrenaline piercing back into my veins with a cold vengeance.\n\nEach of the fourteen doors in the corridor were open in a straight 90° angle, standing in rows like pawns on a chessboard. The rooms were all dark as earth, like small black holes.\n\nSuddenly, the crying returned, jumping between the rooms every few seconds in a strange pattern.\n\nFirst door on the right (Josh’s room).\n\nLast door on the left (opposite to my room).\n\nFirst door on the left.\n\nLast door on the right (my room).\n\nI was frozen in place, sure that I’d lost my mind, or that Josh was playing some sick prank on me. I wanted to run to my room, but the thing would return there each time, following its pattern. Whatever it was, I’d rather stay put than face it.\n\nAfter the third round, I hatched a plan. Just as the laughing began its fourth round, I started sprinting towards my room. \n\nFirst door on the right. \n\n*Three doors to go.*\n\nLast door on the left. \n\n*One door to go. I picked up my pace for the final sprint.*\n\nFirst door on the left. \n\n*Reached my room and clamored around the inside of the wall for the light switch.*\n\n***click***\n\nLight filled my room, and the crying didn’t resolve its fourth round to the end, instead leaving the room silent. Relieved, I leaned at the door frame and tried to catch my breath, droplets of sweat dropping between the knees I held with a tight grip for additional support.\n\nOut of nowhere a loud bang filled the space. My ears started to faintly ring, and I cocked my head up and looked down the hallway, as my heart pumped like a jack drill, ready to puncture through my chest.\n\nEach of the open doors were now closed, except for mine, slammed shut so violently it’d sounded like a gunshot. My heart throbbed as I jumped inside my room, locked the door and secured a chair to lean tightly under the doorknob, so nothing could break through from the outside.\n\n*Josh must’ve heard that, he MUST have,* I thought, and decided to text him. As I opened up our text conversation, I started to doubt myself once again. *Am I just drunk as fuck? Am I dreaming?* *Is this delirium experienced firsthand?*\n\nAfter a few minutes of pondering, my mind a haze, I texted him “hey, heard something weird. u up?” just to see if he was awake without arousing suspicion of my possibly deteriorating mental health. \n\nI laid under the covers, staring at my phone, hoping for a notification, until eventually I passed out. Josh never answered my text.",

        "text": "They say the ladder festival started off as a singing contest back in the days of empires.\n\nOnce a year, in a certain meadow at around midnight, the villages would gather. Each village would send out a team of three young men carrying a ladder to represent them. Two men would hold the ladder upright and the third would climb to the top of it and sing the songs of his people.\n\nIf the singer couldn’t balance on top of the ladder, they would receive a disqualification along with whatever injuries the fall would cause. Those that had decent balance would be judged on their singing talent by the crowds. The best singer would bring glory to their village and would be honored by all until the next ladder festival.\n\nOr at least that’s what folks say. I’m sure a historian could paint you a better picture than me. I’m only familiar with the modern version of the ladder festival — The Ladder Game.\n\nThe game is played a couple times a year. There’s not much rhyme or reason to the timing, but a shared ‘Ladder Game’ WhatsApp group always gives ample warning and taunts those who refuse to join. The players don’t meet in a meadow. They meet at one of the dead stretches of road between the villages.\n\nThree guys, a ladder, and a truck.\n\nTwo guys still hold the ladder and one still climbs, but that’s where the resemblance to the ladder festival ends. There’s no singing involved in the ladder game. Folks just jump into the back of the truck, hold on for their lives and ride.\n\nAs you might have guessed, the police are no fans of the Ladder Game. A bunch of folks died in the 90s and very specific laws were put on the books to dissuade future generations from playing the game. The moral panic has faded over the past twenty years and all players were able to avoid death or injuries obvious enough to arouse suspicion, but aside from the players no spectators are allowed to attend the Ladder Game.\n\nThat is, unless you’re me.\n\nMy pops is an electrical engineer and my ma works in a cheese factory, but I am related to village nobility. My cousin is known as the reigning champion of the ladder game. His Christian name is Jan, but he’s been baptized in the water of legends as *Žaba* — The frog.\n\nMost say the nickname was born on his first ride, some suggest it was his second or third. Either way, near the start of his Ladder Game career, my cousin’s foot slipped during the ascent to the top rung of the ladder. Instead of crashing down to the ground Jan managed to make a landing on one of the nearby trees. Against the advice of everyone present, Jan jumped back onto the ladder and insisted the game continue.\n\nMany claim he was drunk. A few will say he was blindfolded. All will agree that he leaped like a frog. Regardless of the details, from that night onwards my cousin was solely known as Žaba.\n\nThe Ladder Game was a strictly secret affair. Every extra soul could mean the cops showing up and ruining the festivities. Regular spectators were forbidden from attending The Ladder game. Any kin of Žaba’s, however, was welcome to watch.\n\nSo, I did.\n\nŽaba was just a couple years older than me but I never met him in school. My cousin dropped out the moment it became a legal possibility and took a job hauling at the factory. Occasionally my mother would mention my cousin as a sort of parable about why I should study harder, yet those were the sort of stories that get nodded off and forgotten. Until I worked a summer at the cheese factory, I had no idea I even had a cousin.\n\nHe was tall and lean and perpetually unkempt. No one at the factory paid any attention to him and he didn’t stand out. My cousin would just haul, smoke outside and haul some more. I scarcely paid attention to him. He was just another working adult to me.\n\nThen, one day, coming out of the factory — he approached me. My cousin had left work at noon that day and the stench coming off of him left no illusions about how he spent his free time. Reeking like a distillery with a hand-rolled cigarette in his mouth he asked me if I knew about the Ladder Game.\n\nI told him I didn’t.\n\nHe said he would show me.\n\nI know getting into cars with drunk drivers is a terrible idea, but the road to the Ladder Game is always paved with poor judgment. Jan picked me up from my house well after midnight and seemed no more sober than he did in the evening. As he drove my cousin did his best to explain the Ladder Game but no words, drunken or sober, could do justice to the real thing.\n\nEvery time that I have witnessed the Ladder Game four villages were represented: The Poles, from across the border, The Deadenders, from the village where the road finished, The Parrots, from the fake village where everyone pretended to be city folk, and us; The Cheesemen.\n\nThe gathering looked like a drunken search party for a dead kid. The night was black and the only thing that cut through it were the headlights of the gathered cars and the wild stars above. Off in the darkness dirty reflectors gave vague suggestions of the road where the game would be taking place.\n\nThere definitely was a cheery mood among the contestants and drivers when we arrived, but the moment my cousin stepped into the light the excitement of the gathering reached a fevered pitch. The crowd celebrated the arrival of their hero and, when my cousin introduced me as his kin, they celebrated me as well.\n\nWhen I asked why everyone was calling my cousin “the frog” I was treated to a dramatic rendition of the legend by one of The Parrots. I would come to hear that story at every Ladder Game. It would never be the same. It would always differ in the details but my cousin would always nod along.\n\nThe details didn’t matter. What mattered was the myth of Žaba.\n\nThe first contestants of The Ladder Game that night were The Parrots. The city boy visiting for the summer managed to climb up easily enough, but when he reached the upper rungs of the moving ladder his grip slipped. Luckily, the city boy landed in the nearby grass instead of the rough asphalt of the road. He didn’t die, his injuries weren’t too obvious and he could still walk albeit with a limp. The Parrots did retreat back to their village after the fall, but they did so in reasonably good cheer. No lasting damage had been done.\n\nEveryone seemed to be in good spirits, but my cousin took great offense to the fall. Žaba insisted that his team be the next to compete. No one gathered resisted. Soon enough my cousin and the two sons of the village butcher jumped into the back of their truck and proceeded to illustrate the proper way to play The Ladder Game.\n\nThe Parrot’s ascent was impressive in its own right, but Žaba blew the city kid’s acrobatics out of the water. My cousin climbed to the top of the ladder with lightning speed and, when there was no space left to climb, he planted his feet on the top rung and extended his arms to his sides like the big man from the church. Where Jesus was a suffering martyr, however, Žaba was a wild manifestation of adrenaline-fueled joy. He stood atop the ladder with his arms outstretched, howling to the sky like a wolf who had just found plump prey.\n\nI watched this display of ecstasy sitting on the hood of the Polish truck. I didn’t understand my drinking companion but the slivovitz helped bridge the divide. As my cousin screamed through the star-filled sky I asked The Pole the question that had been on my mind all night.\n\n“How does one win The Ladder Game?”\n\nThe Pole took a swig of the bottle and pointed at my cousin.\n\nThe slivovitz dulled most of my memory that night, but what I recall with burning intensity is my cousin’s descent from the ladder. He came down wild-eyed and sweaty and with a burning hand-rolled cigarette in his mouth. He raved, to all present, about the beauty of the night air, about the intoxicating nature of standing on the edge. The Žaba preached the gospel of The Ladder Game to a ravenous crowd of followers.\n\nI soon found myself a convert.\n\nIt was surreal seeing Žaba at work Monday morning. He descended from the realm of a living God to that of mere mortals. What was even more disturbing is he didn’t seem to care at all. When the other workers pushed him around and chastised him for being too slow he simply shrugged and moved on. He knew he was something more beyond the confines of the cheese factory.\n\nSo did I.\n\nIt wasn’t until I had visited a couple ladder games that my cousin entertained the idea. My voice had turned deep and hair was starting to spring up above my lip, I was grown enough to start thinking about becoming a man. To my cousin, and all his friends, there was only one way to end a childhood.\n\nSo I trained. I climbed the ladder near the old barn with zealous discipline and I stayed sober during every ladder game I visited just so all the mistakes and techniques would stay cemented in my mind. I watched a lot of accidents, but the thought of backing away from the game never even crossed my mind. For each broken bone I witnessed, I witnessed plenty of soft falls that avoided the powerlines. The memories of all accidents were washed away by Žaba’s ladder-side sermons.\n\nI watched and I climbed and I prepared for the day that I would feel the night flow through my hair. I thought that by imitating my cousin I would get to taste the joy that flowed through his blood whenever he stepped off the ladder. When the moment to climb the ladder finally arrived last night, I got what I was promised.\n\nLast night I tasted the forbidden fruit that my cousin would get so intoxicated of. Had that been the only thing that happened I would look back at last night with joy. \n\nYet, last night, I witnessed much more than just the rush of The Ladder Game.\n\nIt’s been a strange week. My induction into The Ladder Game was meant to take place this summer, but since one of the butcher’s boys got arrested on Monday my initiation was expedited. I was to become the second ladder holder for the Cheesemen but no one was allowed to hold the ladder if they didn’t climb it.\n\nI didn’t feel ready, but Žaba said I was. I didn’t question his expertise.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Ladder Game there were rumors of The Parrots hearing strange noises in the night and The Deadenders spoke of snakes falling from the sky in their village. The rumors didn’t help my nerves, but strange tales are pretty standard in the countryside. The night before The Ladder Game I woke up to the sounds of unearthly thunder but I was far too sleepy to make sense of it. It wasn’t until the morning that the terror had reached me.\n\nA storm swept through the hills. A storm filled with fist sized hail and chilling gusts and enough rain to turn all the fields into mud. The storm dragged on into the afternoon and didn’t die off until sundown. I was still scared of the wind or hail making a return while I was suspended in the air, but it wasn’t until the contestants converged that true fear struck me.\n\nOnly one of the Deadenders showed. The first had stayed at home in shock. The other had slipped from a ladder while checking the Deadend church for stork nests. \n\nHe was dead, impaled on the metal fence of the church.\n\nThe Parrots didn’t show at all, presumably because of the storm, but their absence meant nothing to me. The dead Deadender was enough of an omen already. The one farmhand that showed suggested that the game be postponed to another date and I was more than partial to the idea.\n\nŽaba, however, refused outright. The Ladder Game had never been postponed before and it would not be postponed tonight. Additionally, the one Deadender was not allowed to leave. He would help hold the ladder with one of the Poles as Žaba drove. I was to become a man before sunrise.\n\nIt was terrifying to disagree with Žaba — terrifying enough that I eventually relented. In my protest, however, The Poles suggested they go first and give me some time to gather my thoughts. Žaba, eventually, agreed.\n\nAside from one particular wobble that put the ladder rider on a near-imminent collision course with a powerline, The Poles performed adequately. I was scarcely able to watch though. All I could pay attention to was how sweaty my palms were getting. I was not ready to climb the ladder, but I knew I couldn’t turn back.\n\nOnce I knew I would one day climb the ladder I stayed sober at all the games. I knew all my brainpower to observe. That fateful night, however, it only took one look at the Deadender who would be holding my ladder to make me reach for the slivovitz bottle. The guy’s friend was dead and he was clearly shaken by the tragedy. I didn’t trust him to keep me in the air. The Pole in charge of the other side of the ladder seemed stable enough and the shot of slivovitz helped loosen me up, but my hands shook as I placed them on the ladder.\n\nThe moment had come. Žaba was behind the wheel and the engine of the truck was coughing awake. My body refused to move, but with a couple of sharp words of encouragement from my cousin I found my feet standing on wood.\n\nThe first couple of steps passed by in an instant. It wasn’t until I was high enough to crack my skull that my knees started to shake. The road beneath us was slick with rain and even though I couldn’t see the Deadender’s face, his mere presence made me nervous. My hands wrapped around the ladder in an iron grip and refused to move any further.\n\nI was sure the only way my body could climb would be down, but Žaba pressing down on the gas pedal spurred me into an ascent. The faster the truck was moving the more dangerous the Ladder Game would become. \n\nŽaba wouldn’t let the game finish halfway through.\n\nI gathered all the courage I had and continued to climb. I kept my eyes locked on the rungs of the ladder and simmered down all my thoughts into mechanical commands. I was going to get to the top of the ladder as quickly as possible just so that I get my feet back on the ground. The adrenalin kept me quick all the way to the top. I was a creature with a singular purpose. But then, my hands slowed.\n\nThat elusive thing that Žaba rambled about over liquor and cigarettes. That frigid night wind, the wild stars above, that thin line between life and death — the purpose of The Ladder Game.\n\nIt all hit me like a brick, but I kept my balance. I kept my balance and I gripped the wood and howled like a mad wolf. Down below, the horn of the truck harmonized with me. For a fleeting moment I felt utter rapture.\n\nThen my body jerked to the right.\n\nIt was a slight movement, barely noticeable, but when you’re balancing near power lines you tend to be hyper aware. I looked down. My hyper-vigilance proved to be well founded. Down below, for a mere moment, I saw the Deadender let go of the ladder. Only the Pole remained to keep me stable.\n\nHe did a poor job.\n\nIt all happened in an instant. One moment I was slightly off balance and the next I was flying through the air. Before the terror of landing on the asphalt hit me, something else did — a branch.\n\nOne moment I was clutching to the ladder and the next I was clutching the limb of an old beech tree. The wood had knocked the wind out of me, and my face was bleeding from getting acquainted with smaller branches — but I was alive.\n\nŽaba drove the truck back around and kept on insisting that I jump back on the ladder as he once did. I never talked back to my cousin but I had no interest in leaping through the night. All I wanted to do was get my feet back on solid ground. Against my cousin’s wishes, the Pole jumped off the truck and provided a ladder for my descent.\n\nŽaba was furious that I did not follow in his footsteps. I feared that my cousin would swing at me, but his rage was mainly directed at the Deadender who dropped me. Immediately, Žaba punched the farmhand square in the nose. The Deadender tried explaining that he had heard something from beyond the hills that terrified him, but Žaba was deaf to his explanation. He simply kept throwing punches until the Deadender ran off into the night.\n\nThe Pole that had held the other side of the ladder insisted that The Ladder Game be brought to a close. As did his two compatriots. As did I. Had our pleas been heard the night would have ended much differently. Žaba, however, refused to bring the game to a close. \n\nHe wanted to show us how the *real* ladder game is to be played.\n\nI felt like I had been run over by a car but I was not allowed to leave or even sit down. Žaba wanted me to hold the ladder with the other Cheeseman and one of the Poles would drive. No one wanted to take part in the last ride, especially not me — yet no resistance was put up.\n\nOut on those dark roads, The Žaba’s word would always be law.\n\nI had never held the ladder before, but my mind was far too disturbed by my fall to feel nervous. I just clutched the wood as hard as I could and focused on keeping completely still. I did not watch my cousin climb, but within seconds his voice was distant enough to suggest he reached the top of the ladder. He was ordering the Pole to drive faster. He was ordering us to look up and witness him.\n\nThat’s when the rumble in the distance started.\n\nThe sound was familiar. It was the exact strange thunder I had heard the night before the storm, but it was louder. Both me and the other ladder holder shouted at my cousin to come back down.\n\nIn response, all the Žaba did was laugh. He wasn’t going to let a little bit of rain end his fun. Only idiots were scared of thunder, he yelled. Žaba thought he was defying the weather, but it quickly became clear that it was not ordinary thunder that we were hearing.\n\nThe roar rolled through the hills until it became deafening enough to overpower my cousin’s howls. It was not thunder. I had spent my whole life in the village and encountered all sorts of bad weather but I never heard anything like it. There was an unnatural metallic tinge to it, it sounded less like a thunderclap and more like the roar of some massive engine. I wanted to look up at the source of the sound but my eyes wouldn’t let me.\n\nAll I saw was a flash of two blood red lights and the silhouette of something huge. A terrible pain shot through my eyes to the back of my skull. The butcher’s boy was just as panicked as I was, the Pole even stopped the truck — but Žaba did not come down.\n\nThe noise became unbearable. It’s mere presence was so loud that I felt like I was going deaf. Something was moving right above us but my body refused to witness it. All I could do was stare at my feet and grip the ladder with every bit of concentration I had.\n\nThe light of the moon became obscured and my feet were planted into complete darkness. Something above me moved. Something above me moved but my neck refused to look up. All I could do was stare at my feet and pray for the terror to come to an end.\n\nThe roar from the sky never fully disappeared but once it had faded enough to allow the rest of the world to exist, I was spurred back into reality. I heard the crackling of flames above me. I looked up, expecting to see my cousin standing atop the ladder but I did not see him.\n\nThe top of the ladder was snapped away and what was left of it was burning. Bits of flaming wood hissed in the wet grass nearby and, about a dozen meters away from the car, sat another pile of flames.\n\nBy the time the paramedics arrived the body was unidentifiable, but they took our word for it. My cousin had died the same way he had lived — atop a ladder. The mechanics of his death, however, were a complete mystery.\n\nThe authorities had decided that he fell into the power-lines.\n\nI insisted that he did not.\n\nMy cousin was nowhere near the power-lines and he wouldn’t fall from the ladder. He was Žaba. What killed him wasn’t a misstep. What killed him did not come from this world. Something had hit him up there. Something big and loud and hot enough to set his body on fire. \n\nIn response, the cops threatened me with a breathalyzer. Their power-line explanation made no sense, but they insisted upon it. No negotiation was permitted.\n\nI was the last one to accept that version of events. I put up resistance to the official story all the way until the police drove me home. It wasn’t until my father, drowsy with sleep, sat down with me that I relented.\n\nHe said nothing good comes from the Ladder Game. He also reminded me of the multitude of laws that existed to prevent the youth from engaging in the forbidden sport. I was lucky I didn’t get arrested. Whatever had happened, he said, was better left unexplored.\n\nI wager he is right.\n\nI wager he is right, but the questions keep eating away at me. They keep eating away at me and I reckon they always will. That terrible engine sound is still scratching through my ears and I can still feel the wood of the ladder against my palms. I just hope that with time the memory will pass.\n\nI also hope that whatever my cousin met up there, whatever terrible machine flew through the sky and ended his life — I hope it never comes [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11k3ds4/morana_air/).",

        "text": " In the sleepy village of Ravenwood, there stood an imposing manor, long abandoned by the wealthy family that had once occupied it. For decades, the locals spoke in hushed whispers about the strange occurrences that had plagued the estate, warning their children to stay away.\n\nOne gloomy evening, a young artist named Thomas ventured into the abandoned manor, hoping to find inspiration for his latest work. He crept through the creaking front door, his heart racing as he entered the grand foyer. Cobwebs and dust covered every surface, and the once-elegant furniture had succumbed to decay.\n\nAs he explored the derelict manor, he stumbled upon a hidden room tucked away at the end of a dimly lit corridor. The room was small and windowless, with a single wooden chair resting in the center. On the wall, a portrait of a mysterious woman with an enigmatic smile held his attention. Her eyes, a captivating shade of emerald green, seemed to follow him as he moved around the room.\n\nThomas knew that he had found the inspiration he was seeking. He decided to paint his own version of the woman, determined to capture her ethereal beauty. Back in his small studio, he worked tirelessly for days, until finally, he was satisfied with his masterpiece.\n\nHis friends and fellow artists marveled at the painting, commenting on the woman's hypnotic gaze and the way her eyes seemed to follow them. As the days went by, Thomas noticed that he couldn't tear his gaze away from the woman in the portrait. He felt her presence growing stronger, as if she were somehow watching him.\n\nLate one evening, as Thomas stared at the portrait, he could have sworn he heard the faintest of whispers. \"Thomas,\" the voice called out, \"set me free.\" He shook his head in disbelief, chalking it up to exhaustion and an overactive imagination.\n\nBut the whispers persisted. Night after night, the voice grew louder and more insistent, until Thomas could no longer ignore it. He returned to the abandoned manor, clutching his portrait and the original painting of the mysterious woman.\n\nHe entered the hidden room and placed both paintings side by side, studying them intently. As he did so, he noticed that his version of the woman seemed more lifelike than the original. Suddenly, the woman in his painting blinked, her green eyes locked onto his. Thomas stumbled back in terror, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\"Set me free,\" the woman repeated, her voice now clear and resonant. She explained that she was a powerful witch named Lilith, imprisoned within the portrait centuries ago by the ancestors of the family that had lived in the manor. They had feared her power and sought to keep her trapped for eternity. With each passing generation, her spirit grew weaker, and her visage in the portrait began to fade.\n\nBut now, with Thomas's painting, she could finally break the curse that bound her. All he had to do was burn the original portrait, and she would be free. In return, she promised him fame, fortune, and the ability to create art that would surpass anything he had ever imagined.\n\nThomas hesitated, torn between his desire for success and the nagging feeling that releasing Lilith could have dire consequences. Despite his reservations, he lit a match and held it to the original painting, watching as the flames consumed it.\n\nA chilling gust of wind swept through the room, and the woman in his painting vanished. The room fell silent, and Thomas found himself alone once more. He stumbled out of the manor, gasping for air as he emerged into the moonlit night.\n\nIn the days that followed, Thomas's life changed dramatically. His paintings sold for exorbitant  \n\nsums, earning him both fame and fortune. Critics hailed him as a prodigy, and his work was displayed in galleries around the world. Yet, despite his success, an unsettling feeling of dread gnawed at him, and he couldn't shake the memory of Lilith's haunting eyes.\n\nSoon after, strange things began to happen in the village of Ravenwood. People went missing, only to be found days later, their bodies contorted and lifeless. Whispers of unknown darkness spread through the village like a plague, and an atmosphere of fear and despair settled over the once-peaceful community.\n\nThomas, plagued by guilt, realized that he had unwittingly unleashed a malevolent force upon the village. He knew that he had to find a way to imprison Lilith once again, but he had no idea how to accomplish such a feat.\n\nDesperate for answers, he sought the guidance of a wise old woman who lived on the outskirts of the village. She was rumored to possess ancient knowledge of the occult, and many believed her to be a witch herself.\n\nUpon hearing Thomas's story, the old woman's eyes grew wide with fear. She revealed that the only way to imprison Lilith was to create another portrait, this time capturing her true, malevolent form. The task would be dangerous, as Lilith would undoubtedly try to stop him. However, the woman provided Thomas with a small amulet, said to offer protection against dark forces.\n\nArmed with the amulet and his paints, Thomas returned to the abandoned manor. He could feel Lilith's presence, a chilling energy that permeated the air. He entered the hidden room, set up his easel, and began to paint.\n\nAs he worked, a sinister figure materialized before him, her once-enigmatic smile twisted into a cruel sneer. Lilith's emerald eyes now burned with malice, and her voice was filled with venom as she attempted to sway Thomas from his task.\n\n\"You fool,\" she hissed. \"Did you really think you could trap me again? I am far more powerful than you can comprehend.\"\n\nDespite her threats and taunts, Thomas continued to paint, his hand guided by a force beyond his understanding. The amulet around his neck pulsed with a warm, protective energy, shielding him from Lilith's malevolent influence.\n\nAs the painting neared completion, Lilith's fury intensified, her form twisting and writhing as she desperately tried to break through the amulet's protective barrier. But it was too late. With a final stroke, Thomas captured her essence within the new portrait, her wicked grin forever frozen on the canvas.\n\nThe room fell silent, and Lilith's presence vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. Thomas, exhausted and shaken, carried the new portrait to the old woman, who promptly locked it away in a hidden vault, sealed with powerful enchantments to keep Lilith contained for all eternity.\n\nThe village of Ravenwood slowly returned to normal, the darkness that had gripped it gradually fading away. Thomas, however, was forever changed. He could no longer find joy in his art, haunted by the knowledge of what he had unleashed upon the world.\n\nIn time, he left the village, seeking solace in solitude. The once-famed artist faded into obscurity, his name all but forgotten. But deep within the hidden vault, the portrait of Lilith remained, her malevolent eyes forever watching, waiting for the day when she might be set free once more.",

        "text": "I’ve been flying as a bush pilot in Alaska for the last five years or so. It’s a pretty good job for the right sort of person. It goes without saying that you need to be a pretty handy pilot, specifically of small and light aircraft, but beyond that, it also requires a special sort of personality. Folks who thrive on social interaction and the safe comfort of civilization need not apply. Being self-sufficient and mechanically inclined are pretty much prerequisites for those who want stay on this side of the grave, and I’d say it’s fairly important that you have a level head and don’t have a tendency to panic in stressful situations.\n\nNow, don’t misunderstand; I’m not talking about thrill-seekers or those who don’t have a healthy respect for death; those folks don’t tend to last too long in this business. They either end up as another in the long list of missing planes that gains new entries each year, or else they quickly learn that their employers aren’t willing to risk their expensive equipment and cargo with someone that isn’t going to take every possible precaution to ensure the safe return of said aircraft. \n\nI’m just saying that you have to be able to set your fears aside when you’re in the thick of it. If something goes wrong, you need a clear head – you can always puke or pass out once you’re safely on the ground again. I’ve had my share of cold sweats, standing on a frozen runway after a close brush with the afterlife.\n\nMe? I’m a transplant from south Florida, where I spent much of my time doing puddle-jump charters in a small, twin-engine Beechcraft. Interesting, sure, but dealing with people has never been my strong suit. I’m not exactly the sociable sort, even less so when I’m trying to fly. When you’ve got four passengers sitting a couple feet behind you and expecting you to play tour guide on their two-hour flight across the Everglades, it gets old pretty quick.\n\nOr at least it did for me. I guess it works for some people.\n\nAnyway, a flying buddy of mine that I hadn’t talked to in years called me up out of the blue one day with a lead on an open seat at the bush charter company he’d been working with out of Fairbanks. One of their pilots had decided that the harsh Alaskan winters and isolation were more than his nerves could take, so he gave his notice, packed his bags, and headed back south.\n\nTruth-be-told, I had never really considered looking for a gig in Alaska. I always had the impression that most of the bush pilots working there had been flying STOL – that’s Short Take-Off and Landing – in the back country since they were old enough to walk. Nick assured me that there were plenty of respected pilots up there who had originated from the lower-48. When he floated the salary numbers in my direction, I didn’t take too long thinking about it before I’d made my decision, and two weeks later I found myself standing in the offices of my new employer.\n\nThat was a while back, and although it took a bit to become accustomed to the type of bush flying that this place demands, I settled in pretty quick and was soon assigned my permanent ride, a De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver.\n\n*Maggie*, after a Yellow Lab I had as a kid.\n\nMan, what a beauty she is. Solar-yellow with black piping and looking just as pristine as when she rolled off the assembly line in 1967. The Beaver is probably the best bush plane to ever grace the skies, and I’m fairly certain that *Maggie* saved my ass from a stupid mistake on more than one occasion. \n\nAnyway, I’m getting off-track. \n\nSo, at the time this story took place, I’d been flying for Viking Bush Charters for probably a year or so. I’d just returned from dropping supplies to a ranger station up near Denali when I got a call over the radio from my dispatcher.\n\nI was in the hangar at the time, getting a hot cup of coffee while the mechanic was refitting *Maggie* with her tundra tires, swapping out the floats I’d needed for the supply drop-off earlier. The big, almost cartoonish tires were perfect for most of the areas I tended to fly into, and made for a soft, if energetic, landing.\n\nI was looking forward to getting back to my trailer and relaxing, maybe watching a movie before dozing off, but the crackle from my two-way told me that my exciting plans for the night might not play out.\n\n“Go for Hooper,” I answered, taking a sip of the steaming coffee.\n\nThe voice of Buck Jacobs replied through the light static. “Hey, Hoop. What’s your status?”\n\n“Eh, Mike is working on *Maggie’s* gear, and I was getting ready to head home for the evening. What’s up?”\n\nThere was a moment’s pause before Buck replied. “Sorry, Hoop, but I need you to do a turnaround. We just got a call from a ranger station up near Birch Creek. They’ve got someone up there that had a run-in with a brown bear and is pretty banged up.”\n\nI cursed under my breath, but there wasn’t any real venom in it. I learned a while ago that, up here, everybody helps when it’s needed. You never know when it’s going to be you on the other side of that call.\n\n“Can’t they fly him out themselves?” I asked, but I was already walking around my plane to where Mike Nichols was working.\n\n“Negative, Hoop. It’s an emergency and we’re the nearest phone call. I’d send Jackie, but she’s not back from her run up to Minto yet,” he replied.\n\n“Okay, Buck – no worries. I’ll help Mike get *Maggie* refit and prepped. I should be wheels-up in an hour or so,” I said.\n\n“Thanks, Hoop. I’ll have the details in your hands in fifteen. Dispatch out.”\n\nAnd there went my relaxing evening.\n\n\\*\n\nTrue to my prediction, I was taxiing down the company’s private runway an hour later, the vibration from the big radial engine creating a gentle thrumming that filled the interior. It was just before 3PM when I was airborne, and being that it was late February, I knew I had just over two hours before sunset. So long as everything went smoothly, that should have been enough time to reach the ranger station, load up the passenger, and get back to Fairbanks before dark.\n\nThe weather was pretty good when I left – it was pushing plus-10 degrees, and although the reports were calling for snow that evening, the sky was clear as I rose above the trees and turned northeast towards the ranger station.\n\nEverything was going smoothly for the first thirty minutes, before those distant storm clouds I’d been watching on the horizon suddenly seemed to take a keen interest in me and headed my way much faster than I’d have liked. \n\nTo make matters worse, I’d started to notice a subtle *bumping* sensation intermittently coming from the engine. I wasn’t sure if I was starting to lose one of the nine cylinders or if it was something else, but it was definitely something I was keeping my eye on. \n\nIf I’d been on a regular supply run, I’d have turned around and headed back to Fairbanks right then and there to get it checked out, but I was acutely aware that anyone who’d had a tangle with a grizzly was probably in a bad way. My flight out to the Birch Creek ranger station may very well mean the difference between life and death for this unfortunate soul.\n\nAfter another fifteen minutes, I knew that I wasn’t going to make it to the ranger station.\n\nThe storm clouds that had been approaching had now overtaken me and covered the afternoon sky in a thick blanket of gray-black ugliness. I could see the periodic flashes of lightning within them, and the air had grown turbulent. To make matters worse, that engine miss I’d been feeling had become more frequent and severe, and I was sure that I now had multiple cylinders that were beginning to fail. \n\nI grabbed the VHF and radioed back to dispatch.\n\n“Viking ground, Viking three-two-zero-foxtrot.”\n\nBuck’s voice crackled through a moment later. “Viking three-two-zero-foxtrot, Viking ground. Reading you, Hoop.”\n\n“Buck, I’ve run into some nasty weather here and have started picking up some engine issues. I’m afraid I’m going to have to abort and head for home. Please advise Birch Creek ranger station of my situation.”\n\nBuck didn’t argue; he knew I wouldn’t abort a pickup like this for a few snow flurries. “Roger that, Hoop. Looking at the weather radar now. Advise you make your heading one-eight-five degrees and drop to nine-hundred to avoid the worst of it.”\n\n“Roger that. Viking three-two-zero-foxtrot out,” I said, banking the plane to the right and starting my return to the airfield. The stormfront, which had overtaken me from my left, had also descended with its approach, bringing the clouds low and thick. I pushed forward on the yoke, starting my descent to Buck’s recommendation and hoping that there weren’t any errant mountains in my way.\n\nFive minutes later, I was fighting with the wind for control of *Maggie* and was now nearly in a white-out condition, relying almost exclusively on my instruments for navigation. The turbulence was getting severe, tossing the workhorse bush plane around like a kite in a gale. More than once, the groaning of the wing struts made me wonder if the storm was pushing *Maggie* past her comfort zone and testing the limits of her airframe.\n\nI descended a bit more, dropping to five hundred feet, aware that in these low-visibility conditions, I was pushing my luck with the terrain. The air was a little cleaner down here, though, and the visibility a little better, but I was still being thrown around and I knew I’d have to climb again pretty soon in order to clear the ridgeline I knew was not too far ahead of me. An unnerving metallic popping noise from above my head drew my attention momentarily, and in that moment, I made the decision that I had to find a place to set her down and wait out the storm as best I could. \n\nThe trees below me were becoming visible now at this altitude, their peaks piercing the low cloud cover and heavy snowfall like ghostly claws, reaching up from the depths of some abyssal grave to drag me down.\n\nThe biggest issue I faced now was finding a suitable place to land safely. I knew that the winds had pushed me off course and I wasn’t as familiar with this area as most others I spent time flying over. I wasn’t aware of any landing strips nearby and was just praying to find a large enough clearing to accommodate her. \n\nAnother engine miss, worse this time.\n\nThis time, the strained drone of the radial cut out completely for a half-second before resuming, and for the first time since I’d come to Alaska, I realized that there was a very real possibility that I might not make it home. If the engine died completely in what was now a strong tail wind, my airspeed would quickly drop until one of my wings stalled. When that happened, the Beaver would wing-over and I’d tumble to the ground in an unrecoverable death spiral. It might be months or years before my wreckage was discovered out here in the wilderness.\n\nI considered trying to turn into the wind, to keep as much airspeed as possible in that event, but it was gusting bad enough that I was afraid to attempt it, especially with a limping engine.\n\nI was getting ready to radio dispatch and let Buck know of my worsening situation when the thick clouds parted ahead of me briefly. In that instant, I thought I’d won the most important lottery of my life. Directly ahead of me, a quarter of a mile out, was the unmistakable rectangular shape of a small airstrip. It was covered in snow that I hoped wasn’t too deep, but it was my salvation – a lifeline that I wouldn’t dare refuse. \n\nI quickly adjusted my approach and set my flaps as I made for it. Another strong gust fought me, trying to throw me out of alignment with the narrow clearing, but I fought back with throttle and rudder as best I could as I watched the altimeter steadily wind down like an analog clock going backwards in time. \n\nI reached out for the radio handset to advise Buck of my situation and estimated location, but the next gust almost tore the yoke out of my left hand, and I snapped instantly back to a white-knuckled, two-handed grip.\n\nMy altitude dropped to two hundred feet. \n\nI was going too fast, I knew. At this speed, I’d either overshoot the strip altogether and slam into the dense tree line, or hit the ground so hard that I’d shear off my gear and probably break my back in the process. I couldn’t slow her down any further, though, or I would risk dropping below stall speed in the strong tail wind, and that would mean a quick trip to the frozen ground.\n\nA hundred feet.\n\n*Maggie’s* wings dipped below the tree line now as I entered the long and narrow swath of the landing strip, the tall cedars and spruces towering around me forebodingly. The tail wind dropped, obstructed by the great barrier of trees behind me, and I took a breath to thank whatever powers-that-be for this unexpected bit of good fortune. \n\nFifty feet.\n\nWith the flaps set to full, I bled off airspeed quickly and my reflexes took over, transitioning from my near-ballistic flight to a more controlled approach, one the Beaver was much more suited to. \n\nTen feet.\n\nI pulled back on the yoke and momentarily throttled up as my gear kissed the top of the snow, flaring the bush plane and setting down a bit harder than I would have liked, the jarring of the impact thankfully cushioned by the tundra tires.\n\nI rolled out for another twenty feet or so before *Maggie* came to a halt in the knee-deep snow, thankful that I hadn’t nosed over. I killed the engine and rested my forehead on the yoke, trying to get my heart rate under control. I didn’t think the shaking of my hands had anything to do with the temperature.\n\nThe daylight was fading, but was still light enough to allow me a good view of my surroundings through *Maggie’s* windows.\n\nI was in the middle of what I guessed was the landing strip, since the tree lines on either side seemed to be about the same distance from me. Those trees were even more imposing down here on the ground. They rose like towering walls on either side, and the woodlands beyond held deep shadows that were only accentuated by the heavy snowfall that continued to obscure my vision. \n\nI reached for the radio and keyed the mic, hailing dispatch. I didn’t have much faith that the VHF would be able to penetrate the trees and the mountain ridge that lay between me and Buck, but it was worth a shot. After a long moment of hissing static, I tried again, but with the same results. It was doubtful that I’d be able to get a signal through until the storm passed, and even then, I didn’t think it likely unless I could get *Maggie* airborne again. \n\nWith only a moment’s deliberation and a resigned sigh, I retrieved the emergency locator beacon from my jacket pocket and activated it. The unit would broadcast a distress signal, along with my location, to the monitoring service. I knew it would be a day, at least, before help arrived, but the sooner I sent the call, the sooner they’d be able to get to me.\n\nI took another look out through the fuselage windows. If there was a landing strip, that meant a possibility that someone was nearby. I didn’t think there was a ranger station out here, but there were enough hunting cabins and homesteads that there was a decent chance I could find shelter. The interior of the plane was still warm, but I knew that wouldn’t last very long in this weather, especially with night approaching.\n\nI unbuckled myself and climbed back through the seats into the cargo area, where I pulled on my heavy coat and shouldered my emergency pack. \n\nGrabbing my rifle from its rack behind the pilot’s seat, I unlatched and swung open the cargo door. A blast of arctic wind hit me in the face, and I squinted my eyes against it, quickly pulling my goggles on and my hood up before dropping to the snow-covered runway.\n\nI pulled the cargo door closed and trudged around the rear of the plane, standing in the furrows left by *Maggie’s* wheels and turning in a slow circle as I tried to discern any indication of human presence. Despite the howling wind that pulled at my coat and hood, I caught the unmistakable scent of woodsmoke and breathed a small sigh of relief; at least I knew I wasn’t alone out here.\n\nAs I scanned my surroundings, my eyes alighted on what looked like a small utility shed on the western edge of the clearing, and I moved with as much speed as the deep snow would allow in its direction. To the left of it, I spied a waist-high railing marking a walkway that led into the shadowed tree line and quickened my pace. \n\nI followed the trail, now feeling what were likely wooden planks beneath my boots. Once in the trees, the brutal wind of the storm lessened and the snow drifted down from the canopy in slow, dancing swirls before settling on the ground with a muted hiss that sounded like the forest around me was quietly exhaling. Between the dim light of the coming dusk and the snowfall, I couldn’t see much beyond the trees nearest me, and I relied on the handrail to guide my travel. It was another few minutes of plodding through the snow-covered walkway before I finally saw the building. \n\nAt first, I thought it was a hunting cabin, solitary amidst the endless sea of trees. As I drew closer, though, I could see it was much larger than I first thought – low and wide and of modern construction. Some sort of sign stood between two timber uprights just off the path, its face covered in snow and ice. I paused to brush it clear, somewhat surprised to see the blue background and logo of the Alaskan Division of Agriculture. White lettering beneath it indicated that this was the White River Basin Agricultural Research Center.\n\nI’d never heard of the ADoA having wilderness research centers, but I supposed it wasn’t too far-fetched. Regardless, this was even better news than I’d expected; this meant that I wasn’t approaching some isolated hunting camp, but instead a government post. And *that* meant my chances of survival and rescue had just increased significantly. \n\nI gave a hoot of joy and patted the sign as if it were an old friend who had just delivered some good news, and jogged the remaining handful of yards to the front door of the building. \n\nJust as I approached, however, the door abruptly swung open, spilling yellow light across the white snow. A man stepped out from the doorway and shouldered a shotgun, leveling it right at my head, his eyes wide and wild as they stared down the barrel at me. \n\n“*Stop right there!*” he shouted at me, his words coming in angry puffs of steam in the frigid air. “*Don’t come any closer!”*\n\n“*Whoa!* Hold on a minute, chief! Just wait!” I answered, my hands going up reflexively. “I’m not here to cause any trouble.”\n\nHe motioned with the shotgun. “Drop the rifle, nice and slow. I’m warning you; I won’t hesitate to blow you in half if you make any sudden moves.”\n\nHolding my free hand up to show I was no threat, I bent slowly and placed the rifle on the ground before rising again. “What’s going on?”\n\n“Who are you? What are you doing here?” He demanded. I could see the muzzle of the shotgun trembling and worried that he might end up shooting me by mistake just due to nerves. He was wearing what looked like a government-issued coat with an embroidered patch on the shoulder and had a week’s growth of beard.\n\n“*Easy*, boss,” I said, trying to keep my voice level and calm. “My name’s Hooper. I’m a pilot for Viking Bush Charters, out of Fairbanks. My plane was forced down in the storm and I was lucky to find your landing strip before she ended up in the trees.”\n\nI was starting to wonder if *lucky* was the right word anymore.\n\nHe looked at me a long minute, his eyes scanning me over, then motioned at me again with the shotgun. “Take off your goggles – let me see your eyes,” he said.\n\nThat caught me off-guard, but I nodded and slowly moved my hands to remove the tinted goggles, careful to not make any sudden moves. \n\nHe leaned towards me, eyes locked hard on mine searchingly. Then, seemingly satisfied, he abruptly lowered his gun and nodded, as if reassuring himself. He jerked his head back toward the doorway and his entire demeanor suddenly changed. “Well, Hooper, come on inside. And bring your rifle. It’s too damned cold out here.” With that, he turned and walked back inside, resting the shotgun against the interior wall next to the door as he did so.\n\nNow even more confused than before, I reached down and picked up my rifle from the snowy ground, my gaze never leaving the man. As inconspicuously as I could, I worked the lever, chambering a cartridge, and followed him in. It was such a bizarre interaction, I wanted to make sure he wouldn’t surprise me again if he decided to change his mind. \n\nWhen I entered the building and closed the door behind me, I found myself in what looked like a wood-paneled visitors room, with a couch on one wall and a blazing fireplace fronted by a couple of chairs on the opposite. The man had moved over to a small table near the fireplace, pouring a glass of whiskey from a half-empty bottle and now seemingly completely disinterested in my presence. I frowned and glanced around the room. Aside from the sparse furnishings, there was a closed door across from the one I had entered through, labeled with a “Restricted Access” sign.\n\nThe man took a long drink from his glass and turned back to me, holding the whiskey bottle out to me in offering. I just shook my head.\n\n“Sorry about all that,” he said, gesturing vaguely to the door behind me. “Can’t be too careful. I’m Morgan Tate – field research.”\n\nI eyed him cautiously. “Okay, Morgan Tate. Do you make a habit of welcoming visitors with a shotgun?” I still wasn’t sure exactly who I was dealing with here, but something was clearly off. \n\nHe just grinned at some private joke that he alone shared and then ducked his head in a nod, taking another swallow of the whiskey. “Lately? Yeah. Or, at least, I would if I got any visitors.” He pointed at me with his tumbler and sat heavily in the chair. I was starting to get the impression that this wasn’t the first drink of the day for Mr. Morgan Tate. “You’re the first living person I’ve seen in more than a week,” he added.\n\n“Are you the only one here?” I asked, looking around the room. There was a row of hooks on the wall beside the door and I took note of several coats hung there.\n\nHe smirked, something unreadable behind his eyes. “Now, yeah.”\n\nI didn’t know what sort of game he was playing at, but I was starting to lose my patience. “Care to elaborate on that? I’m having kind of a rough day and you’re not making it any easier.”\n\nThe dark-haired man finished off his drink and stood. “Sure, why not? I suppose you’re part of this now,” he said, moving past me toward the “Restricted Access” door. \n\nI followed him as he pushed the door open and proceeded along a narrow, tiled corridor, lit by harsh fluorescent lights. It felt out of place, more like I was walking through the halls of a hospital than an ADoA building in the middle of the bush. He looked over his shoulder and took note of my surprise.\n\n“Yeah, not quite like the ranger stations, is it?” He said, stopping in front of a heavy-looking door at the end of the corridor and keying a quick code into the panel above the handle. I heard a soft click and he pushed it open, exposing a darkened room beyond. He entered and the lights flickered on as I followed. \n\nThe room we now stood in was larger than the previous one – probably thirty feet across and smelling of antiseptic and chemicals. Several rows of stainless-steel tables were neatly arranged within, occupied with various unfamiliar laboratory paraphernalia and equipment. In addition to these lab stations, there also appeared to be examination tables along the far wall, a few of which had white cloths covering unidentifiable shapes. I suppressed a shudder; it reminded me of a morgue, though the concealed objects were too small to be human bodies. \n\n“What is this place?” I asked, my eyes taking it all in. \n\n“Just like the sign outside says, Hooper, this is the White River Basin Agricultural Research Center,” he replied, leaning against one of the tables. “It was set up to monitor large mammal wildlife migrations with potential correlation to climate change.”\n\n“Huh,” I replied evenly. “Sounds interesting.”\n\nHe grinned. “No, it doesn’t. Not even to me, and I *work* here. Would you believe that a week ago, there were twenty-five researchers living and working here? *Twenty-five*, Hooper. This place was *hopping*, man.”\n\nAn uncomfortable tingle ran down my spine, and I shifted the rifle in my hand, the weight of it reassuring as it hung at my side. If Tate noticed, he didn’t mention it.\n\n“What happened last week?” I asked carefully.\n\nWhen he turned back to me the smirk was gone from his face and his eyes had widened. Whatever was in his thoughts now, he didn’t find it amusing anymore. “That’s when *they* came, Hooper.”\n\n“*They?*”\n\n“The *shadows, man*. *The shadows!* They came from the *storm!* You remember the *storm*, don’t you?” \n\nThe storm. \n\nI knew what he was talking about, of course; I don’t think anyone around here would forget it anytime soon. It was a little more than a week ago, when that freak blizzard came out of nowhere, unpredicted and unexplained. What had started out as a cloudless and unseasonably warm morning ended up burying us in nearly two feet of snow by the time it was over. The sky had shifted from bright and sunny to a bruised and angry granite color within the span of an hour, clouds rolling so low and heavy that it seemed like you could almost reach up and touch them. Our weather station at the field was clocking sustained wind speeds of fifty knots, with gusts up to eighty-five, and we were in a total whiteout condition for the next fourteen hours. We were all trapped in the hangar, huddled around the kerosene jet heaters, listening to the wind as it tried to tear apart the heavy steel structure around us.\n\nBy the time the next day came, it was just gone, replaced by the clear blue skies of the previous morning. \n\nNobody had any good explanation for it, but I’d heard a couple of the old-timers who ran the machine shop whispering about it in the back. I couldn’t make out much of what they were saying – I didn’t much care, if I’m being honest – but they sounded worried. At the time, I thought it was a little strange that the weather would unnerve them as much as it seemed to; these guys were both full-blood Inuit and as hard as nails – it was almost comical to think they’d be worried about a surprise blizzard. No, now that I think back on it, it almost seemed like they were more worried about something *in* the blizzard. I can’t be sure, since they kept switching in and out of English, but that’s the impression I got, anyway.\n\n“The shadows?” I asked, confused.\n\nHis eyes had drifted off into the distance for a moment, lost in his own world. In the next moment, he snapped them back to me eagerly, like he’d just had an epiphany, and said, “*Yeah*. Do you want to see one?”\n\n“Do I want to see a shadow? What the hell are you talking about, man? You’re not making any sense.”\n\nBut he was already on the move again, walking across the room to another door. He beckoned me to follow, entered his code, and pushed it open. Wordlessly, I followed, unease whispering in my ear. \n\nHe led me along another hallway, glancing over his shoulder periodically like he was making sure I was still there.\n\n“I caught one. The other researchers didn’t think it was possible, but I knew I could,” he said, and it almost sounded like he was talking to himself more than to me. He stopped at a door marked “OR-2”, pushed it open and walked inside.\n\nI trailed behind him hesitantly, feeling apprehensive about this whole thing. A slow feeling of dread had been worming its way through my subconscious and I wasn’t so sure I wanted to follow this man much further. The whole situation felt wrong, and I was starting to think that Mr. Morgan Tate was more than a little unhinged. \n\nWhere were the other researchers he’d mentioned? I’d question whether they ever existed at all, if not for the size of the place and the coats hanging by the door in the reception area.\n\nThe room I stepped into now was much smaller than the others and had the feel of some sort of control room. The wall to my left held narrow lockers and a rack of coat hooks occupied by several white lab coats. To my right was a console lined with monitors and keyboards, and above that, the entire upper portion of the wall appeared to be an observation window looking into a darkened room. On the opposite wall was one of those airlock doors that you see in isolation areas of hospitals, stainless-steel and with a small circular window in its smooth surface.\n\nThe computer monitors were on and were displaying various graphs and streams of data. Tate sat on one of the chairs at the console and started typing into the keyboard.\n\n“They’re incredible,” he said absently. “Like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”\n\nI moved closer to the observation window, straining to make out anything in the darkened room beyond. All I saw was the stygian blackness, though.\n\n“You have something in there?” I asked, suddenly feeling very uncomfortable. I wasn’t sure I wanted to see whatever this nutcase wanted to show me. “Why are the lights off?”\n\nHe glanced away from the console for a second and turned an unreadable grin on me. “They’re not.” With that, he stood and leaned forward, pounding the heel of his fist against the window with a resounding shudder, making me jump in surprise.\n\nI didn’t quite understand what I saw next. The darkness that had obscured my view suddenly swept aside, like someone snatching a curtain violently from across a window and out of sight. \n\nBut that wasn’t quite right, either, though. It was more fluid in its abrupt motion, almost like smoke being pulled away by an incredibly powerful and unseen exhaust fan. A muted screeching sound reached my ears, sounding eerily like a poor imitation of a bird of prey. I assumed that the observation room was soundproof, or near enough, and wondered exactly how loud that wailing must have been for it to reach my ears.\n\nI leaned closer to the window, peering upward and to the left, where the darkness had disappeared to, but I couldn’t see any vestige of it. \n\nAnd then I looked to the rest of the room and drew an involuntary gasp at the horror I saw.\n\nA dozen corpses lay strewn about the otherwise barren interior of the room. \n\nBut they weren’t bodies anymore, not really. They were nothing more than skeletons now, still dressed in the clothes they’d worn when they fell. Most were intact, though a few had scattered where they struck the tiled floor. The bones were stripped of all remnants of flesh and were bleach white.  \n\n“*What the fuck?*” I said in revulsion and shock, barely above a whisper.\n\nTate nodded excitedly. “It’s incredible, isn’t it? The others left, but I was able to lure two of them into the holding room and trap them there.”\n\nI stepped back, feeling my stomach turn, and turned an incredulous gaze upon the man. “But, the bodies…” \n\nHe nodded again, almost eagerly. “That’s how I lured them. Most of the remaining researchers fled in here to hide. You see, it needs to eat, to *hunt*. It can’t survive without sustenance, no more than you or I. There were two in the beginning, but after the food ran out, this one turned on the other and now there’s only one.”\n\n“The food? You mean those *people*?” I tightened the grip on my rifle and took a step backwards to put a little space between the two of us. \n\n“When the shadows came in the darkness of the storm, a few of them were able to slip into the building before we realized what was happening. Half of the researchers were taken that night, in their sleep. You see, they hide and wait for the right moment. They avoid the light; I think it weakens them, but in the darkness...” he trailed off, and I saw an uncomfortable smile grow across his lips, almost of admiration, it seemed. “In the *darkness*, that’s where they live. *That’s* where they thrive, where they reign.”\n\nI took another step backwards, my free hand reaching for the door handle behind me and opening it, pushing it with my foot. “You’re crazy,” I said, bringing the rifle up in line with his chest.\n\nIf he even noticed it, he gave no indication. His eyes had taken on that maniacal glint again, and he stood, giving a small nod that I thought was meant to reassure me. “There’s no more for it to eat, Hooper. It’s been *days* since I’ve been able to feed it.” He took a slow step towards me, and I matched it with a retreating one of my own. He smiled and continued, as if explaining to a child. “I have only myself left to offer, but that’s not enough. Don’t you *understand?* This isn’t just a *thing*, not just an animal. It’s far beyond our understanding – far beyond our own primitive evolution. It’s *perfect*.”\n\nHis eyes flicked away from me for a moment to an illuminated red button on the console nearby, and his hand drifted over to it.\n\n“*Don’t!*” I shouted, bringing the rifle up to my shoulder. “Don’t do it, Tate!”\n\n“There’s nothing to be afraid of,” he said, an obscene caricature of gentleness filling his voice. “It’s quick.” His hand hovered over the button.\n\n“I *will* shoot you, Tate! Don’t make me do it!”\n\nFrom where I stood, I could see another of those airlock doors through the observation window, and to my horror, a swirling mass of impenetrable blackness massed at the threshold. I could almost feel its anticipation. This wasn’t the first time it had been fed. It knew what was coming.\n\nIn that instant, when my eyes flicked away from him, Tate stabbed at the button. With a curse, I squeezed the trigger on the rifle at the same instant, but it was too late. The deafening report in the small room was immense, but even as the round tore through the man’s chest, he’d already pressed it.\n\nI watched in horror as the twin airlock doors began to retract, and without another thought, I turned and fled as fast as my weary muscles could carry me. Thankfully, the codes required to open the doors weren’t needed to exit them, and I flew down the hall and through the research room. As I passed it and threw open the door to the reception area, I heard that wailing screech again from somewhere behind me, haunting and otherworldly, echoing through the empty facility, much louder than before. \n\nThen, I heard another sound, this one the agonized screaming of Morgan Tate. I only gave it the briefest of thoughts as I jerked open the outer door and fled into the snowstorm. I could only hope that feeding time would give me enough of a window to make it back to *Maggie*. \n\nThe air had darkened even more with the coming of dusk and had grown colder. Thankfully, the storm seemed to have lost much of its fury, the front having now passed by and leaving me in its relatively calm wake.\n\nI ran along the path, just enough light remaining of the day to follow the tracks I’d made on my way in. The rifle was heavy in my grip, but I didn’t dare lose my only defense. When that howling screech echoed through the trees behind me, I redoubled my speed, praying that it wouldn’t be able to find me before I’d reached *Maggie*. \n\nThe frigid air burned my lungs, and my throat was raw by the time I reached the snow-covered landing strip. I almost cried with joy at the sight of my bright yellow *Maggie*, waiting patiently for my return.\n\nI reached the cargo hatch and swung it open, throwing myself inside and pulling it shut behind me just as another of those haunting wails reached my ears, closer this time. \n\nMuch closer.\n\nI didn’t dare look out the windows as I threw off my pack and rifle and climbed back into the pilot’s seat. I buckled on my harness and my hands danced over the controls, the start-up procedure second nature.\n\n*Battery master on, fuel selector to center, mixture lever forward, fuel-oil shutoff lever down…*\n\nA resounding high-pitched howl penetrated the cabin and something black moved outside, rushing from window to window, door to door, searching. It was here now, trying to find a way inside!\n\n*Concentrate!*\n\n*…throttle at 10%, fuel pressure pumped to 5 PSI, engine primed…*\n\nI froze. My windshield had suddenly gone completely black, shrouding me in darkness. Even though I couldn’t see anything in the featureless void just a foot away from my face, I could *feel* its desperation. I felt its sightless gaze, and below that, some dark malice, an inhuman and alien hunger.\n\nI pressed the starter switch and the 9-cylinder radial engine started turning over, slowly at first, laggard and sluggish. My blood chilled as I realized that it wasn’t catching, wasn’t starting. My thoughts flew back to the engine problems I’d been experiencing before my emergency landing and, in that moment, I was certain my luck had finally run out.\n\nBut then, a backfire, then another, and then a third, coughing black puffs of smoke from the exhaust. \n\nAnd then it caught, and that big, beautiful Pratt &amp; Whitney radial took over, the loud drone rising smooth and steady as *Maggie* woke from her slumber. I pushed the throttle forward, inertia pressing me into my seat. I no longer cared about the engine misfires or the storm – a fiery death in the trees was preferable to whatever that *thing* had in store for me, I was sure.\n\nThe snow was deep, and even with the big tundra tires, I had to work to keep from nosing over as I began to gain speed. At some point, the black mass disappeared from my windscreen, and I was greeted with the glorious sight of an open path before me. \n\nWith the passing of the stormfront, the wind had shifted directions, and I was into a headwind now, perfect for my needs. I pushed the throttle to full and pulled back gently on the yoke. I felt the wheels leave the ground, now free from the snow’s drag, and continued my climb until I was above the trees and gently banking back toward the south, towards home.\n\nAs I passed over the landing strip, I thought I could just make out a black shape on the ground below, stretching and snaking along after me in its futile pursuit before I lost it in the trees.\n\n\\*\n\nThe engine miss returned after another ten minutes of flying, but *Maggie* carried me back to safety. She always took care of me. Forty minutes later, I was back on the ground in Fairbanks and taxiing for the hangar. \n\nStopping the bush plane just outside, I shut her down, unbuckled myself, and carefully climbed down to the runway, where my body fought with itself for which was going to happen first, the puking or the passing out.\n\nAt this point, I’d happily suffer either.\n\nMike Nichols came jogging out of the hangar after hearing my approach and helped steady me.\n\n“Jesus, Hoop, you gave us all a scare,” he smiled amiably. “It must have been a hell of a flight – you look like you saw a ghost, man.”\n\nI could only nod and stumble my way towards the warmth of the hangar, grateful for his shoulder to brace myself against. Just before we reached the service door, he paused and looked back at *Maggie*. “Buck told me you had some engine problems, but he didn’t say anything about a fire.”\n\nI frowned and shook my head. “No fire. I lost some cylinders.”\n\nHe stood there a moment longer, an odd expression on his face, before opening the door and ushering me inside. “Weird. I thought I saw some black smoke coming from under the engine cowl right after you [shut her down.\"](https://www.youtube.com/@dark_night_tales)",

        "text": "Hello, I'd like to share something that happened to me when I was nine years old and that I remember really well even now that I am 35. I swear I'm not lying or seeking for attention, but it bothers me that I haven't been able to find a proper explanation until now so I am asking for your help.\n\nI was on holidays with my family at Gabicce, a fairly known place on the Adriatic coast in Italy. I am mentioning it because there are several weird legends surrounding this region, like the Valbruna town's, which is known as the \"Italian Atlantis\", since it was apparently submerged by the sea for unknown reasons during Roman times, and fishers and locals claim to have found remnants of columns, temples and other proof of it, as well as an ancient temple dedicated to Zeus which was located on the St. Bartolo Mount, which is located just nearby, or miraculous sightings of the Virgin Mary. Also, It's quite an eerie place, because mountains, sea and towns are all merged together.\n\nI was taking a stroll with my father, there were many people surrounding us because it was June and the streets near the seaside were crowded, when I suddenly saw something really weird laying on the pavement.\n\nIt was animal's, a reptyle's apparently, leg, which had been cut off, but instead of dripping blood it oozed a clear, slimy fluid. It was dark green, almost black in colour, covered in scales, a little lighter underneath, with three slender digits, the middle one longer than the others, and every digit sported a curved claw, like a hen's foot. Of course I got really spooked off, and I instantly tried grabbing my father's attention about my discovery, but he looked really annoyed at me, claiming there was nothing on the pavement. I am absolutely sure he wasn't lying, but at the same time I am also really sure about what I saw. Nobody else seemed to notice that horrible paw, so I just walked away. When I got back a couple hours later and checked the same spot, there was nothing.\n\nAs I grew older, I did some research, and I found some similarities with a Tatzelwurm's leg (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatzelwurm), but since that creature is legendary and apparently doesn't really exists, I was more oriented believing that it could have been an abnormally big slow worm or lizard's leg, except that those usually have four digits instead of three and that they usually don't sport claws of any sort. I also researched about sea cryptids, but no sea worms or other creatures have been sighted in the Adriatic sea. If that was a cryptid's leg, though, other people should have seen it. Another possible (?) explanation is the Green Man, which is a legend about a reptile-human hybrid which has been sighted in various places near river Po in Emilia-Romagna, but it looks like he's really elusive and refuses contact with humans. I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nWhat really bothers me is that nobody apparently could see what I saw on that day... do you believe it might have belonged to some ghostly being? Or to a fae? Could someone help me understand? And who, or what, could cut it off like that? And for what reason?\n\nThese unanswered questions are really obsessing me lately...",

        "text": "Hello there my name is Brook Simone, I was told this was the site my son used before he disappeared. I have read his story and what he experienced during the nights. I...I should have known this would happen, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN DAMN IT.  I...I knew about the visitor I knew about EVERYTHING. It's just that I thought since I survived, I thought it won't go after me or my family ever again.\n\nOh right, sorry you must be confused. You might have some questions about what happened to me in the past or just what the visitor is. It might not be the right time for explanations but you should know as well.\n\nlets start off with me back when I was in college back before my ....son..... was even born back when I used to live in the same apartment my son also lived in.\n\nI was a \"tech wiz\" or what people call those who invents and discover new things. I may not be the smartest of the bunch but my friend tells me I was the brightest and most innovative in our class. In pre-school, I wasn't the one who can answer instantly when a teacher asked a question, I was the one who sits in the back building car engines using lego pieces.\n\nAs time went by, I began to have an interest to the supernatural. In college, I stopped inventing things and started doing research to anomalies and such. I was so intrigued in the stories of fictional monsters and gods to the point where It became my life's goal to encounter one. Boy, what a dumb dream that.  \n\n\nIt all started when I found a peculiar book under one of the bookshelves in the library I go to when I study, it looked like it sat there for hundreds of years. As one might expect, the book was covered in dust and cobwebs, I blew on it scattering all the dust away from the book making a cloud of dust in the air. I stupidly inhaled some dust and made me cough a bit, after that I looked back at the book. The book was covered in leather, I don't which animal was it from though. It also had a bunch of weird symbols written in its spine. In the front the title wrote \" o le  aon  quod  daxil oldu  o le dii\". It took a while to translate it since each words were in a different language but it might have said \"the one that entered the gods\" or \"...entered the realm of the gods\". I don't know I only remembered it vividly since it was years ago.\n\nIf I remember correctly the story was about a being that transcended all logic, speaks in actual contradiction, like it speaks about it being a dog but it's next sentence stated that in fact it was a cat. I don't know, reading it's story really made me run for my money as it was very difficult to read sentences with each word being in a different language some I don't even think is from this world.\n\nThe book talked about the being named  **Philoxenus.** though not human It was a but a normal being, living and surviving day in day out. The book stated that Philoxenus existed before man, before life on earth, it also stated that it lived when the earth did not have a proper barrier from the heat rays of the sun making it dangerous for life to flourish in the planet, but of course Philoxenus defied the law and existed in small patch land where it stayed lying there dormant not being able to move to the intense heat of the sun. It stayed stationary for millions of years until the ozone layer was finally formed. In which case it finally regained it's conscience.\n\nIt's awakening shook the earth which made a volcano to erupt under the sea and formed an island. Seeing its new creation Philoxenus wanted more, it wanted to know the limit of what it could do.  while it was on it's vegetable state before the ozone layer formed, Philoxenus had a dream, it dreamt of reaching the heavens, the sky the it looked at for millions of years waiting to get up. It jumped as high as it can shaking the very earth as he past through the moon, maars, and even the sun. It jumped so high it reached the void, a place between galaxies, a place where nothing exists, a place where no light, no life, and no planets.\n\nPhiloxenus questioned where it was, with no sense as to what direction it came from, it continued exploring the vast emptiness of the void. Hundreds of years has passed, still no sign of life, Philoxenus was big but the void was larger... much.....much larger. Philoxenus wanted to see something again, it wanted to see light, and life again. It has spent many years wishing to go back home, wishing to find a place to stay, wishing to find sanctuary, wishing to **VISIT** the place where it could finally fulfil it's goal of reaching the heavens. Hundreds of years passed by more, hope was fleeting, It did not know what to do, it had been floating in an endless void for many centuries. Until finally it saw light.\n\nIt finally found what it was looking for, the heavens the realm of the gods, in front of it was a door, a gigantic door bigger than the sun itself. Philoxenus clenched its fist winds up its arms preparing to **KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK** the knocking echoes through space and time, one so loud it penetrated the vacuum of space. The door then opens revealing a very bright light and in that light came out something Philoxenus did not expect.\n\nAn entity of pure light with wings bigger than planets, eyes that are impossible to count, a being so mystical, it temporarily blinded Philoxenus due to it's unfathomable features.   \n\n\nit then spoke:  \n\"be not afraid for I am a seraph of God\"  \n\n\nPhiloxenus:  \n\"seraph? God? what's that?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe seraph ignored Philoxenus' question and said something that would change Philoxenus life for the worst.  \n\n\nSeraph:\n\n\"child, thou are not meant to be here, thou must go back from whence thou came\"  \n\n\nPhiloxenus rightfully enraged from what he had heard;\n\n\"WHAT? what do you mean I need to go back? I suffered HUNDREDS of nothingness just to get here and you want me to go back? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IV-\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe seraph:   \n\"DO NOT QUESTION THE WORD OF GOD\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit's wings with impossible size and numbers started to move and flapped once. With that one single flap of it's wings. Made Philoxenus fly away with incredible speed. within seconds it arrived from the same place where it left, earth. fueled by rage, it's muscles tensed up so hard it's body emitted smoke. it's body then became so small it looked entirely different from what it originally look. It became skin and bones, its once might flesh turned to what you might think is it robes like a witch in a cartoon.\n\nwith one final fuel of rage it shouted \"CURSE YOU AND YOUR CREATION! I WILL TAKE EVERYTHING FROM YOU! YOU AND YOUR AVATARS! YOU SHALL SEE MY WRATH'' \n\nPhiloxenus then vanishes to the shadows never to be seen again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwell folks, that's about what I remembered in the book since the last few pages was complete gibberish and I could not decrypt any words from them. I do not know what it meant by \"avatars\" and how it correlates to it's **visits** If I knew I would have told you sooner. But for now let us end it here. next part will be about my encounter with **THE VISITOR.**",

        "text": "My roomie and I have been playing a game, [“Doll in the Hall,”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/) which is like Elf on the Shelf but the elf is a terrifying sock doll come to life. We’ve been recording the doll’s paranormal activity—*for science!*\n\nIt was a *very* long night, for reasons I’ll explain, and so when I started [typing this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ryj2m/my_roommates_creepy_doll_went_viral_am_i_a_jerk/) I quickly realized I’d need about six more cups of coffee and a diet coke to get through it all.\n\nSo, apologies for taking so long with this update, but I’m back now, baby, an Energizer Bunny bashing on the keys! (Why yes, my diet *does* consist almost entirely of caffeine and aspartame; doesn’t yours?).\n\nRight then, let’s get to it!\n\n**Darwin Award:**\n\nCurt came home within about 20 minutes of Karen posting our video of the doll, Boo Boy, toddling around, and predictably lost his shit. He threatened to kick us out unless Karen destroyed both the video and Boo Boy, who was suddenly nowhere to be found. Karen physically blocked Curt from entering her room to search (bold of her, given not only is the man twice her size, but we have an ongoing bet about whether he’s ever buried anyone in his backyard). She shouted that she *wouldn’t* take down the video but *would* call the police if Curt entered her room, and then slammed and locked the door.\n\nCurt swore and kicked the sofa.\n\n“Hey!” I said. “Chill—”\n\n“DO NOT bark orders at me in my own house! You unleash bad fucking mojo—”\n\n“It’s just a doll—”\n\n“You are playing with fire, and don’t even know you’re already burning!” He jammed his finger at me. “Well, I am not gonna be the collateral damage! If I so much as catch a *glimpse* of that… *THING…* toddling into my room, I will break its little legs, then I will break *your* little legs, then I will throw you both out on your asses onto the street to live in a box begging for money with your broken little legs—you get me?”\n\nHonestly, I had to admire the man’s eloquence. I mean, dollars to donuts he’d really do it, but hey, he sure could turn a phrase, huh?\n\n(Why yes, people who threaten to break my legs are fine in my book, as long as they do it with *pizzazz*!)\n\nAnyway, I was too stressed to sleep after that. Not only because Curt’s belligerent outburst had sent my heart rate spiking, but because after three days of Boo Boy moseying around in my periphery, his sudden absence was… *disconcerting*. Not so much because I didn’t know where he was in that moment, but because of the implications of his avoiding Curt.\n\nYou see, I’d been operating as if Boo Boy’s occasional movements were like ball lightning. Ball lightning is so rare that for centuries it has existed only in anecdotal accounts, and even now remains scientifically unproven. And while some accounts (especially early ones) have mistaken it for the work of spirits or devils, there’s no consciousness directing where the ball lightning appears or disappears. It’s not a spirit, moving with intentionality. And so Boo Boy’s walking was like that in my mind—a unique phenomenon, seemingly occurring at random around the house.\n\nBut his dodging of Curt implied a degree of intelligence--*sentience.*\n\nAnd if this thing was capable of decision-making, not simply moving at random but deliberately and with purpose… then what *was* that purpose?\n\nThis is the question that suddenly, very deeply chilled me. And as I settled on the sofa, I began to wonder if, in my mad quest for science (and Karen’s for clicks), we’d perhaps gone too far… When I skimmed my documentation of Boo Boy’s movements during “Doll in the Hall,” I found that I’d complained about Curt’s caution as “overreacting” but put down Boo Boy walking all around our house as \\*checks notes\\* “normal.”\n\nYeah, okay. My bad. My judgment *may have been clouded.* It’s possible we might have *slightly lost touch with reality*. Passed bananas and gone full fruit salad. Boarded the crazy train, commandeered it, and conducted it right off the rails.\n\nBut now that I was searching for evidence of *intention*, I found that there was nothing in Boo Boy’s movements to support that hypothesis. None save for the one single obvious choice—never to move when directly observed by us or *by the cameras*.\n\nOh God. The thing understands cameras.\n\nCurt’s warning came rushing back to me: *You are playing with fire, and don’t even know you’re already burning.*\n\nAnd so it was partly because I was too creeped out to sleep, partly to keep an eye on things that I stayed out in the living room, turning off the lights so as not to bother my housemates, leaving only the soft glow of the bathroom nightlight.\n\nI sat down on the sofa, adjusting the window shades to allow the moon’s silvery illumination to filter in.\n\nThen I fell to pondering…\n\n**Bad Fucking Mojo:**\n\nSo there I was, mulling over the mysteries of existence. (Deep thought being the virtue philosophers are famous for. You want fun? Flirty? Sexy? Sorry we don’t serve that here. Now, if you’re into endless pontification of the unknowable universe? Oh yeah baby, let me talk *deontologically* to you…)\n\nA shadow flitted in my periphery.\n\nI raised my phone before I even really noticed what I was tracking. It was no larger than a cat, but more like a monkey in its movements… toddling out across the carpet toward Curt’s door with the whisper of fabric.\n\nBoo Boy.\n\nI opened the camera app. Boo Boy had its back to me and I don’t think it had noticed me.\n\nWhen I clicked, a blinding light flared just for an instant. Boo Boy’s head turned, so in that moment of the flash, the doll’s button eyes appeared to be staring right at me. As the light faded, I heard a quiet patter back toward Karen’s bedroom. Her door clicked shut.\n\nApparently, Karen was still awake, because a moment later her door opened and she slipped out.\n\n“Did you see Boo Boy?” I asked.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“I just took a picture of him trying to go into Curt’s room…” I was fumbling with my phone, trying to open the image.\n\nAs soon as I did, I froze.\n\n“What is it?” Karen came over.\n\nMy heart hammered.\n\nI don’t… I don’t know quite how to describe the picture. It’d be easier if I could post it. Only, I don’t have the picture anymore, for reasons that I’ll explain. Honestly, I probably shouldn’t even describe it to you.\n\n(Not to be a tease or anything—I *will* describe it. I didn’t bolster myself with six cups of coffee just to *not* write about the pivotal moment. But I’ll save it for the end, and I’ll put a header warning it’s coming. That way if you want… and if you’re *wise*… you can skip it.)\n\nAccording to Karen, looking at the image was the mental equivalent of taking acid. Like the beginnings of a bad trip. Nausea. Dizziness. Hallucinations. For several moments afterward, everything in her periphery appeared to be crawling with snakeskin.\n\nI, lacking her expertise in illicit substances, can neither confirm nor deny. The best I can describe is that it looked… *wrong*, and it made my brain itch and crawl. My heart hammered as if I’d injected caffeine straight into my veins. Every hair on my body stood on end, and the longer I looked, the *less* I could make sense of it.\n\nThrough the sickening lurching of my mind, one rational thought pierced: my first hypothesis was correct. Boo Boy was *being moved*. Manipulated by a force that hadn’t triggered the motion sensors, but caught in the flash—it’s like it was taken by surprise, unable to camouflage itself. Sudden terror struck me like a sucker punch to my gut, my nerves jangling and then tightening like violin strings ready to snap on the next note.\n\nWe were both still staring at the picture when Curt’s door slammed open.\n\n“I can hear you two whispering. The fuck is going on?”\n\nKaren and I just looked at him like two children caught red-handed over a broken cookie jar. Karen started to tell him it was nothing, but I showed him the picture.\n\n“Jesus Fucking Christ!” he screeched, flinging one hand up to cover his face and the other to shove the phone away. “Jesus motherfucking Christ!”\n\n“Pretty sure he’s not part of this,” I mumbled.\n\n“Plato! Can you fucking please be serious!” begged Karen.\n\n“I *am* serious.”\n\n“You need to burn that motherfucking doll NOW!” said Curt.\n\n“Just *wait.* Okay? Wait!” snapped Karen.\n\nWe all started to talk at once, but Karen shouted us both down, snarling, “Will you just listen? We gotta do this the right way! If we just burn it, we might unleash whatever this… this *thing* is. We have to do what she says!”\n\nThat shut both of us up.\n\nThen, “Who the fuck is ‘*she*’?” demanded Curt.\n\nFor once, I was in agreement with him.\n\nKaren flipped on all the living room lights, opened up the messages on her phone, and introduced us.\n\n**All Aboard the Crazy Train:**\n\nKaren’s video had swiftly racked up thousands of views, including by a woman who went by the handle of “PsychicDeathLady123,” a self-proclaimed expert in dark summonings. She’d messaged Karen and told her she must get rid of the doll before the possession advances further, or the thing manipulating the doll would come for us. Karen hadn’t fully believed her, but had nonetheless been in the middle of listening to her instructions on how to perform a cleansing ritual when my flash had caught the picture.\n\nI had my doubts about this so-called spiritual expert, whose primary credentials were beady eyes, an exaggerated British accent, and jeweled rings on every finger, but in a video call with Karen, she asked right off the bat about Hitori Kakurenbo and who the players of our game were, proving she had at least some rudimentary knowledge of our situation (or at least knew how to Google). Still, it’s not like we were going to find a better paranormal puppetry expert on Yelp. PsychicDeathLady123 instructed us to begin by deleting *all* photographic and video evidence of the doll.\n\n“Why?” I asked.\n\nCue woo woo warnings about how the doll serves as a *token,* to which the spirit could bind itself in order to manifest in the material realm. Supposedly, the spirit could use images as substitutes for the token if players were close enough in proximity to form a psychic link; but if we deleted everything, the spirit would have nothing to latch onto. The players (Karen, I, and Binky—yes, the hamster) could then burn the doll in order to end the game and force the errant spirit back to the spectral realm.\n\n(Incidentally, I also asked about my posts on nosleep. PyschicDeathLady123 said being text only, they’re probably fine. *Probably*. So you know. It’s fine to keep reading. *Probably.*)\n\nWhile Karen drove to her sister’s house to pick up Binky, Curt and I searched for Boo Boy, whom we found tucked into Karen’s bedcovers with his head on the pillow, as if he were sleeping like a good little boy.\n\nGood grief.\n\nLess than an hour later, we gathered around the firepit outside. From in iPad propped on a log, PsychicDeathLady123 guided us through assorted rituals (they were exactly what you’d expect of such rituals, involving various symbols and invocations in what I later found out was a $500 call—apparently there’s an after-hours upcharge).\n\nSince Karen was holding Binky, the honor of closing out the game fell to me.\n\n“Oh, er, well friends, this has been fun, but we are now officially—”\n\n“Hurry the fuck up!”\n\nQuoth Curt, ever the epitome of eloquence.\n\n“Right. So… thanks for playing Doll in the Hall. Bye bye, Boo Boy.” I tossed the ragdoll into the flames. “GG.”\n\nA horrific screech lit up the night. The doll’s limbs curled and turned black, and the little pigtails of hair made from my, Karen’s, and Binky’s locks sizzled and puffed into smoke. All three of us stepped back from the flames and covered our eyes.\n\nSoon there was only ash.\n\n**Game Over:**\n\nAnd there you have it, folks! It’s been one heck of a wild ride, and I’m a day late updating because this post took so long to write, but we’ve officially concluded “Doll in the Hall!” Will update again if any more woo woo weirdness occurs. But since we obeyed the undeniable expertise of PsychicLadyDeath123, I’m going to assume this is *not* one of those horror cliches where we’ve seemingly vanquished the Big Bad Boo, only for it to pop up again in a followup post having possessed a new host (Probably Binky—*I’M KIDDING*! I will never let any harm come to our furry hamster overlord. Please put those pitchforks away).\n\nOh, but for continuity’s sake: YTA? NTA? ESH? Let me know in the comments!\n\nI’ll also post my description of the photo there, too, so you know… as with anyplace on the interwebs, read the comments [*at your own risk.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I write my story I think I should give a little backstory, I moved from Italy to the united states to visit my wife, and see some friends, but I never was well endowed with money, so I eventually started looking for a well paying job, and having had experience with driving cars, especially taxi's I found a job at Uber, for the first-week driving people I only met amazing kind and eel understanding customers, over the week I began to visit some of my family and friends.\n\nWhen I arrived it was nighttime before I reached the driveway of my wife's house.\n\nI knocked at the door of my wife's house, I hadn't seen her in about a year. I waited with butterflies in my stomach as I waited for the door to open. when it did I was greeted with the fragrant smell of well-cooked food and the comforting sound of air conditioning. She was so much more beautiful than I could have imagined. I felt warm goosebumps as I wrapped my arms around her in a huge hug, we went inside, and we sat on the couch still hugging.\n\n\"Ahmad! I miss you so much\" she said finally ending our hug\n\n\"Me too, I'm so sorry it took this long for me to come back iris\"\n\nI really meant it, even with the financial hardship it took to come to visit her it was 100% worth it.\n\nI looked into her eyes as I told her my plans for my stay.\n\n\"I'm planning on getting a job doing taxi services around here,\" I told her\n\n\"Couldn't you find different work, taxi service is so draining for you\"\n\n\"I know iris, but I need to work hard so that you and I can live the life we have been dreaming about for so long\"\n\n\"thank you,\" said iris, I gave her another hug, then looked out of the large glass window.\n\nIris looked at me with a slight smirk.\n\n\"let's go to bed, it's late\"\n\n\"I think your right iris, it is dark outside\" together we walked into the bedroom which was beautifully decorated, and yes...we had the best night of our lives.\n\nThe next day, I woke up and after hurriedly scribbling a short note, that said I had left for work and would be back in a couple of hours, I put it on irises blankets, grabbed my car key's and checked the Uber app, where I saw my next pickup spot,\n\nOh, and I should clarify that It was really early not even morning yet, in fact, its not an understatement to call it nighttime as I sat in my 2022 Toyota corolla\n\nI turned on my favorite song, “butterfly effect” and bobbed my head as I neared the point for the pickup. It was at a casino, and the man that emerged from the neon laced door came and waved at me, I poked my hand out the window, and waved him inside, he stepped in the front seat, and without acknowledging me he began to rock back and forth saying to himself in the most distraught voice.\n\n“oh no, oh NO…I lost all my money I saved all my last year savings and income just to hit my luck, and now I lost all of it just like that, what the heck will I do?”\n\nHe looked as if he was on the verge of hurting himself or worse. he was sweating profusely up till now he had not looked at memoir removed his covid mask. Yes it was that time.\n\nBut when I remember what I saw when he did I start itching and I get chills down my legs and back. \n\nHis Teeth looked like brad nails, and his eyes were an off-white color with a red vein going through each eye, and he swiveled his eyes to look at me. I was so shocked I ran over a traffic stop and came to a hard stop.\n\nI blinked and stared at the horror of a man that was standing before me.\n\n“Sir?” I said.\n\n“Im not a sir” he said tears now running down his black streaked face.\n\nI am not a small guy by any means and I had been hitting jump for the past 5 years, but looking down at y arms now and I felt like I was made of felt.\n\n“Get…out of my car” I said to him using the driver controls to unlock the doors\n\nHe looked at me and stepped out the car, it was then that I saw his mud caked hooves, they were not cloven…\n\nHe must have seen the look on my face, but he quickly unfolded his long pant legs over his “feet” and Ade his way into the misty city morning.\n\nI took a second to breath and get my bearings and locked all the car doors. And drove to my next stope slowly contemplating just going home. \n\n“No” I thought, I couldn’t leave them.\n\n“Some one is depending on Me to get them to there destination safe and quickly”\n\nWith this thought I drove to the next stope at the side of the road, there were two teenagers a guy and a girl, the guy waved and they got in. \n\nAs we chatted about were they were going, and they told my what a bad choice of song I had playing, I considered telling them about the guy I saw earlier.\n\nI didn’t.\n\nThe two teenagers left, I stopped and got some gas .\n\nBeing quite shaken and nearly questioning my sanity, I pulled over to a not yet opened coffee shop, I parked my car, and surfed reddit horror subs.\n\nAfter about three minutes I restarted my car, and after checking my phones Uber app, I drove about 30 more minutes to a small apartment complex. When I parked my car my phone rang.\n\n“Hello” it was the customer\n\n“Oh hello, this is Ahmad from Uber I see you have a pickup scheduled, and I am at the apartment”\n\n“Oh yes…Thank you I am coming down”\n\nI saw the man come down the dirty, concrete apartment stairs. He had a blue hoodie, and sweat pants. he had on a white covid mask.\n\nHe walked up to my car as I unlocked the doors. My heart rate quickened, and I hovered my hand over the lock doors button.\n\nWhen he opened the door, and got in, I couldn’t help but laugh at myself a bit. He looked at me.\n\nI smiled at him. He lied through his mask, I could see his artificially high cheeks’, he had sunglasses.\n\n“hi” I said\n\nHe looked at me he looked like he was smiling.\n\n“hi” I said again trying to get a look at his face\n\nI thought I saw the muddy-white eyes from before, it couldn’t be. This man was a completely different person.\n\nI sat in my chair for a while until I snapped out of it, and looked for the car keys, they were sitting in the middle of the seats. We both looked at them. \n\nI reached slowly down and got them, while bent I felt someone swiftly rub my back soothingly. I cringed sitting back up quickly.\n\n“What the hell was that for dude?” I said now angry\n\n“I didn’t do anything to you” he said looking out of his window with the back of his head turned to me.\n\n”I want to go to the gardening shop, to get some soil”\n\nI was surprised at the randomness of his request, and just nodded wanting to get this over with, but no, I HAD TO FIND OUT.\n\nI don’t know why I did this, but I guess it was just me trying to reassure myself that this man had nothing to do with the freaky man I saw earlier.\n\nI began with a shaky voice, I tried to make I sound as if I was hiding a light laugh.\n\n“earlier I…earlier I saw a freaky monster with white eyes with a whole lot of nails in his mouth…” I said it in a somewhat joking manner\n\n“Have you seen anything like that?” I added\n\nThere was a long silent pause, as the man turned to me, the light of my now flickering dashboard lit up his eyes.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“I have” he said, “he visits everyone with a Toyota”\n\n“Your kidding right?” I was just thinking to myself how stupid this whole thing Was when I saw him reach up to his white face mask.\n\n“Can I take this off?” \n\n“Come on dude, its covid keep your mask on”\n\nFor a second he put down his hands. Then reached back up to his face. He did this with one arm, with the other he yanked the key from the ignition, and pressed the sharp key to my neck, I pressed up against the seat, and he pulled off his sunglasses and mask. \n\n“I don’t know if you will this or not,” he said \n\nHe leaned in on my face, a smell like vanilla filling the car. His gums were like that of a shark, with bent nails lining his mouth, and his eyes, as Im writing this three days later I gag. His eyes were a muddy swirled white color. With no eyelashes, or brows. His eye had no purple or center, just a huge white abyss strung with red veins, that looked as if they would burst.\n\nHe closed his mouth, cutting his already messed-up chin, he had no lips. \n\n“Not to scare you mr Uber driver but, was it like this?”\n\nIt was.",

        "text": "Elizabeth loves her dog, she would do anything for him really. They did almost everything together except eat, dogs are meant to eat on the floor obviously. One thing she loved most about her dog is that it speaks, for example when she was about to go out her dog will ask if she could stay. She would have to tell him things like “Sit boy, be good for me okay?” or “I’ll be back soon, I wont be out for too long” sometimes a pat on the head will do good for him. Other times her dog will whisper at night to her while she tried to sleep.\n\n \n\nHe would often say things like “I will be here,” or “I’m watching you” or sometimes he’ll whisper “hide.” It’s very rare when he tell her to  hide, though she knows it’s just to protect her. She tried to tell people that her dog has such a wonderful talent for speaking but no one believed her, when she told them he can speak they think he barks. Her dog doesn’t bark. Elizabeth loves that about her dog, she think it makes him super unique, sometimes people will want to meet her dog, though they’re not friends. These people who try to visit her dog are men in suits, and when they come over her dog pretends he is unable to speak. He is not very fond of strangers, and really he only loves Elizabeth. Sometimes her dog will go out in the middle of the night and wont usually come back until a few days later, She would ask where he would go but he would never answer her questions, at some point she just stopped asking. Though her dog started acting quite different in the recent weeks, this is because one night he came home early from his trip outside, and he usually will stay out for a few days but tonight was different. He crawled through the doggy door and he sat next to her.\n\n \n\nHe was very quiet up until he got up and stood in front of Elizabeths bed.\n\n \n\n“Andy?” But he didn’t respond his usual response, which would be his whispering. Instead he growled and his bones sounded as though they were cracking, and he started to grow bigger and bigger. He ripped out of this skin of a husky and morphed into a hairless, black monster that reeked of old blood.\n\n \n\n“How long will you keep this up, your time is near…” It growled very quietly.\n\n \n\n“Just a little longer, I can’t let him go yet.” She cried softly, it’s growling became louder and it was clearly growing impatient with Elizabeth.\n\n \n\n“I should rip your throat out tonight, people are beginning to notice, the church has been here too often,” it inhaled deeply and whispered, “They know…”\n\n \n\n“I can protect you! I just need more time with Andy.” She begged the monster.\n\n \n\n“Andy is dead, I’ve killed your husband and his mistress and I agreed to be here for 5 years,” it inhaled, raised two fingers and continued to speak, “Your time is nearing, you have 2 weeks left.” It licked it’s lips and began salivating a black oozing liquid, “Mark my words Elizabeth, I will devour your flesh and it will be painful, I will not show mercy.” It growled an inhumane growl, before opening the door and leaving Elizabeth to her own thoughts. A few days later Andy returned as its usual self and she cherished every moment with him. After the remaining two weeks, Elizabeth and her dog had disappeared, and I found her Journal under the floorboards. In her Journal she wrote the steps down on how to summon the demon she had bargained with, Balaam. Elizabeth was my sister and I am not ready to let her go.",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/11s2ks8 )\n\nI’d gotten halfway to the dome and then found out just how rigged this test was. Max's stepmother must be really angry at to toss this sort of monster our way. The ground rumbled under my feet. From the ruined city came countless bones and bodies pouring out all collecting into one spot in the sky. I’d barely made any progress to the glass dome by the time a true monster formed. It stood higher than any building I’ve seen. The creature a force of nature in the shape of a human skeleton made from the dead. \n\nHow in the ever-living hell did anyone think I could deal with that? The monster’s hand came down and I ducked under a bridge made from a toppled building. The fingers tore through the cement and iron but somehow missed me by a hair. Since I was so small, I could avoid being seen. But if the thing decided to tear apart the entire city, I would be dead. I waited for my moment to make a run for it as the massive hand ripped apart a different building to rain down debris where I wanted to run. \n\n“Toby!” \n\nAnother voice I didn’t expect to hear shouted my name. I looked to see one of Max’s sisters jumping and waving me in her direction. I raced over to her. She took hold of my shoulders to look over what kind of shape I was in. She didn’t like how I looked but knew I refused to give up. \n\n“We’ll take care of this. You’re almost there, so keep going, ok?” She told me with a forced smile. \n\nI looked between her and the skeleton creature doubting that the sisters would be able to stand any kind of chance against it. But she sounded confident. I needed to trust them. With a bit of regret, I started running again hating the fact I needed to leave them behind. \n\nThat regret only lasted a few seconds. When I got further away, I watched Selene shift into a creature I didn’t expect but should have figured out already. Her body turned from a cute receptionist to a snake so large it was taller than most houses. But not that big compared to the skeleton she faced. At least she wasn’t alone. \n\nSo many of those snakes swarmed as the rest of her sisters joined her. Each with white scales that shimmered a light brown when they moved. All of them met to twist into one another. The bodies formed into the face of a wolf. They came up to about half as tall as the other monster. I still worried for them until they all spouted smoke from the false wolf’s mouth. Everything that touched the smoke melted in seconds. It wasn’t enough to fully take down the skeleton but at least it gave me enough time to reach the dome. \n\nNo monsters waited for me inside the glass dome. A glass wall separated me from the rest of the room. I slammed against it because I saw a horrifying sight on the other side through the glass. My best friend and the one I risked my life to save sat in the middle of the room with vines slowly wrapping themselves around his entire body. I shouted Max’s name, but my voice didn’t reach him. He didn’t open his eyes or move in the slightest. I banged against the thick glass but that only ended up hurting my hand. \n\nI needed to calm down and figure out how to reach Max. The glass went from wall to wall, ceiling to floor. There weren’t any openings. The only clue was an etched square in the glass with writing around it. The text was a language I didn’t have a damn clue about how to read it. I think it was the common language the creatures used to make spells. I cursed the fact that I never learned how to read it. \n\nI pressed my forehead against the glass pushing down a breakdown. I got so damn close. What everyone did to get me this far turned out to mean nothing because I was too stupid to learn more about their world. My self-pity party nearly consumed me. I didn’t think any more help could come out of nowhere to solve my problem, but someone did. \n\nI felt something press against my stomach from inside my jacket. It was as if the inside started to fill up with some sort... slime? By the time I processed what was happening, a head poked through my collar followed by a transparent set of arms. Sunny’s face stared back at me as he kept his arms around my neck to remain steady. I wrapped my arms under my jacket to support his weight confused about how he appeared. \n\n“Sunny... You...” I sputtered. \n\nHe gasped seeing the cut on my forehead and my sunken cheeks. It took a lot of him to stay focused on the task at hand. \n\n“I got worried so I drew a door inside your jacket just in case I could come by and help.” He quickly explained. \n\nI got confused for a second. I knew creatures could use magic to connect two doors but would a small drawn-on door and a regular one work? Unless he drew a small one somewhere in the apartment. Because of his body, Sunny could slip through a small opening. But he was on the weaker side magic-wise. At first, I didn’t think he could create connecting doors. But if they were small then he might be able to. He also could have half his body inside one door, and the other half on the other just in case he needed to go back really fast. When I finally clued in, I couldn’t help but hug him. \n\n“Sunny, you're a genius!” I told him. \n\nI thought I saw the orange spot in his head move slightly. It did that when he got nervous. He wasn’t good at taking compliments, so he looked away and spotted the writing on the glass. His face lit up and he leaned in to start reading. \n\n“Do you know what it says?” I asked hopeful. \n\n“No, but it’s similar to other dialects I know. I can figure it out. Give me a second....” \n\nIt took him a full minute to crack the code. I've heard slime creatures could be smart, but I never understood how smart.  \n\n“You need fresh virgin blood. Just place it on the glass and it’ll open.” Sunny explained. \n\nWell, that was easy enough. I doubted I ever would figure that out without him. \n\n“Sunny, you should go back. I don’t know what’s going to happen. It could be dangerous.” I said. \n\nHe nodded hating the fact he wasn’t strong enough to stay around. But he offered way more help than he ever might realize. With a promise I would bring Max back home, I gave him a quick hug and let him go back the way he came. \n\nA dab of fresh blood later and the fake glass door opened into a real one. I bolted inside, the vines wrapping around my ankles the moment I stepped nearby. \n\n“Max!” I shouted praying he heard. \n\nHe stirred, his head lifting slightly and eyes slowly opening. I pushed forwards ripping away vines at each step. \n\n“Toby... You should go back.” Max said in a small voice. \n\nI’ve never heard him like this before. I hurt more than anything else that happened to me that day. I shook my head refusing to give up on him. \n\n“I’m not-” I started but my words got caught in my throat seeing his expression. \n\nI’ve never seen him so distraught. The vines quickened their pace and nearly covered his entire body other than his face. He was letting them take over and I didn’t understand why. \n\n“It was cruel of me to give you my name.” Max admitted. \n\n“Why? Because I’m human?” I asked trying to understand. \n\n“Yes. After... what I did... I have no right to be friends with a human. I let it get this far because I’m selfish.” \n\nI hated hearing him like this. I got a step closer, all those vines trying to keep me back. \n\n“No matter what happened, I’ll listen. I’ll still care about you. So just tell me what’s wrong.” \n\nMax closed his eyes again as if he was about to shut down. Finally, he accepted my request and started talking. \n\n“Some creatures need to eat humans. Others do not. And others kill for fun. I thought I understood all of that and accepted it. I knew why humans hated us and hunted our kind. But... when my mother died... When they killed her, I didn’t care about understanding anything. I was just so angry. They murdered her for being what she was, and yet she never harmed a human. I wanted to get even. So... I just lost it and attacked a village of Hunters.” Max admitted in a distraught voice. \n\n“I can understand that. You-” I started but she shook his head refusing my answer. \n\n“I didn’t just kill Hunters. I killed innocent people who just happened to be there. And even if I only killed the ones who murdered my mother... That isn’t right. They had families that loved them too. I acted completely selfishly. And I haven’t stopped being selfish since. I knew the dead would hate me for this, but I decided something back then. That I would keep smiling each day because I stole that away from them.” \n\nMy best friend looked up and gave me a smile filled with tears. For hundreds of years, he lived for the ones who he took that life away from. I knew Max had genuinely happy moments, but he also forced himself to be happy. I never noticed how he felt. How did I deserve something as important as his name? Max felt guilty that he killed and hurt so many humans and yet he became friends with one. The vines started to creep upwards. I shook my head letting the information sink in. \n\nI pulled free of all the vines holding me back to finally reach Max. I started to pull away his bindings to get to him, tears in both of our eyes. \n\n“Whatever burdens you have we can share them! I’ll smile with you for the ones you killed! I already turned my back on humans, so I can forgive you for what you did even if you can’t forgive yourself!” \n\nTears streamed down my face and the vines ripped the skin on my hands. I didn’t stop. I needed to get to the person I cared so much about. My words reached Max and he pulled his body out from the nest of vines and into my arms. The plants died out the moment I grabbed a hold of him. \n\nBy some miracle and a lot of help, I reached him. I thought the test was over. But again, I was mistaken. A crashing sound tore through the dome as the skeleton's hand ripped off the ceiling. Max shielded me from the falling glass. I hoped his sisters were safe. But we were sitting ducks as the monster spotted the two people standing so far below it. I wasn’t able to stop Max as he ran out ready to attack the monster. I choked on my fear knowing Max wasn’t the strongest creature. If a group of his sisters couldn’t beat this monster, he stood no chance. \n\nOr... At least I thought so. In a flash, my friend turned from his loveable dog-boy self to a towering wolf almost as big as the skeleton he faced. He was far larger than how I saw him before. The plants and flowers twisted up his legs and bloomed on any surface he touched. The battle ended in seconds. Max opened his mouth wide and shot down a burst of magic into the mass of the dead. They all exploded into flowers and other plants. I realized that until that moment my friend had been holding back his magic due to guilt. I think Max might be stronger than any creature I’ve met at the Mailing Company, besides Sterling. \n\nHe shifted back just as Rufus came running over. He scooped his son into his arms over joyed that Max was still alive but also finally let loose his true powers. The rest of the help came piling in. His sisters came a bit beat up but all alive. They all took turns getting hugs from their older half-brother. I counted about thirty of them but wasn’t really sure about the number. Vicky came over to me and I asked where were Belizas fearing the worst. Vicky said Belizas was fine. He just wanted to punch more monsters. \n\n“What are you all celebrating? I have not announced the results of this test yet.” \n\nWe all froze at the sound of the voice. Kytiva stood, hands on her hip and a scowl on her face. Max quickly came over to me to put himself between me and his stepmother. I honestly was scared to death of her and was thankful for him defending me. \n\n“Toby passed the test, right? I mean-” Started one of the sisters. \n\n“And just how did he do that? All of you protected him. He barely did anything on his own. He should be dead ten times over by now.” Kytiva snapped back. \n\nEveryone around me stiffened and Rufus got closer. It looked as if he was ready to lash out and I never thought he had it in him. \n\n“What if he fails? Are you going to kill them?” Rufus asked in a low tone. \n\n“Do you think you can stop me?” She answered back. \n\nEveryone moved into a defensive position. If Kytiva made a move to kill me, she needed to deal with all the other creatures in the room. The issue was, I knew she was strong enough to kill all of us if she needed to. I didn’t want anyone I cared about to die for nothing. She noticed how the group reacted and scoffed. \n\n“You all know I am stronger than all of you. I did not marry you due to your power. I did so for your land and medical plants you can grow.” She pointed out. \n\n“That wasn’t the reas-” Rufus started to correct but stopped himself. \n\nHis reaction broke some of the tension and I thought I saw his cheeks turn slightly red. Kytiva folded her arms over her chest very, very pissed off. Her accent grew thicker as she huffed. \n\n“I married you because your chest is bigger than my own. Stop reminding me!” \n\nI looked. We all looked. Some made it more obvious than others. Max and his sisters had  clear expressions on their faces of suppressing this information. To her credit, Kytiva was still threatening after that scene. She walked over and stopped in front of me. Her arms were still folded, and a sour look on her face. \n\n“You took help every step of the way in this test. So many different creatures provided you aid due to your weaknesses. You have given me no choice but to do this.” \n\nI let out a squeak of fear when her hands landed on my shoulders. My eyes shut tight expecting a painful death. But a soft feeling came to my forehead. When I opened my eyes, I saw Kytiva leaning over to kiss my cut. \n\n“You’re adopted.” \n\nHer words were too much for Rufus. He passed out on the spot and the sisters just let him fall. I expected he did that often. My mouth hung open lacking any words. \n\n“Creatures work based on favors. They exchange time or even words. Everything has a cost. These people who helped you did not do so for free. They did so in exchange for the love you’ve given. In our world love is the most powerful force. It seems as if you are the kind that can give it away freely and make others love you back just as much. It is a rare quality and one any family should be proud of.” \n\nWell, I wasn’t expecting that at all. I opened my mouth to thank her but found it impossible to talk. The entire day caught up to me. I slowly started to fall to my knees and Max came down with me to keep his friend from passing out. I wondered if his stepmother knew people were going to help me when she made this test. She couldn’t be seen as going easy on us and throwing everything at a human that reasonably couldn’t handle the threats on their own. \n\n“You really did put Toby through too much. You bullied him. But... I get why you did all of this.” Max said up to Kytiva sounding annoyed at first. “So... thanks, mom.” He sheepishly added. \n\nHer tough demeanor crumbled away by that single word. Her face flared into a snake-like appearance, and she came down to grab both of us into a tight hug. Max calling her mom for the first time got to her. She kept giving his cheek kisses and saying the same foreign word over and over again. When I tried to pull away from her, she turned the affection onto my unprotected cheek. I preferred it when she didn’t like me. \n\nWith a lot of gentle prying, the sisters got their mother away from us. I still couldn’t stand so Vicky thankfully helped me along so I could take a door back home. Sunny fretted the entire time it took me to get into bed. I wanted to sleep slightly more than I wanted to eat. At the very least I knew I could take some sick days if I needed them to recover. \n\nMax stayed hanging out with Sunny as I slept. Just before I nodded off, I decided on something very important. Max was family to me. A lot of my friends were. I’d told my father a little bit about them but not much. I wanted to change that. Soon, I would ask Max to meet my only other family member. I wanted him to meet my father. The idea made me nervous, but it felt right at the time. \n\nI wasn’t aware of how much such a meeting could change my life forever.",

        "text": "It was close to  2:30 in the morning, and I wanted nothing more than to get home after a long day at the warehouse. It was year-end inventory time so it was all hands on the deck for organization, counting, and making sure what was on the shelves matched what the computers said. As I drove, I felt myself starting to nod off. The day had taken everything out of me. I turned on the radio and hit the scan button. It landed on *Turn the Page* by Bob Seger. I recognized the song from the Metallica cover and sang aloud to keep myself awake.\n\nThe only saving grace about working so late was the roads were empty. Usually, I had to contend with rush hour traffic so it was a treat to have a clear shot home. I was the only driver on the road. Solo, in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, which was odd, considering I’d been paying attention to where I was driving, and hadn’t done anything any different than I did on any other ride home. It was incredibly odd. I didn’t recognize where I was.\n\nAs I pondered this realization, *Turn the Page* ended and gave away to a rush of static. Once again, I found it odd. I never had problems with getting clear radio signals out here. Then I remembered, I didn’t exactly know where *here* was. Without thinking about it, I hit the scan button again, and it landed on station 91.1.\n\nLife hasn’t been the same ever since. \n\n\nThe music playing on station 91.1 wasn't like anything I’d ever heard before. The word *abstract*  comes to mind, but that word isn’t up to snuff in actually describing it. Maybe *experimental* is more suitable. Unsettling and unnerving. The noises coming out over the speakers were unlike anything I’d ever heard before. It sounded like something was being played backward, sped up, and then slowed to an agonizing crawl. It repeated itself in a loop with subtle changes to the voices in the background. At least, I thought it was voices I heard in the background. It’s entirely possible my mind was attempting to assign meaning to the static waves in the universe.\n\nIn the middle of this, a trumpet blasted. It was startling, to say the least. Then there were these random sound effects played throughout. Metal scrapping against metal. The snarls of animals engaged in a life or death struggle. The screams of the dead and the damned. I don’t know how I knew this. Once again, my mind was searching for meaning in nothing. Or perhaps I was tuned into a radio station broadcasting from the bowels of Hell itself.\n\nIt unnerved me to no end. There was something in those sounds my mind, body, and soul recognized as something I shouldn’t be listening to. Everything inside me tightened up with a growing dread ready to spill out into either panic or madness. I hit the scan button again, and the radio went around the full cycle of stations before landing on 91.1 again. I cursed at the radio and hit the button to shut it off. \n\nInstead of silence filling the car, a voice spoke and said:\n\n*Not joy*\n\nIt didn’t sound like it was coming from the song track. It sounded like it was coming from the speakers *themselves*. A jolt of electricity shot up my hand, and I yanked it back to the wheel. As this all happened, I’d been firmly keeping my eyes on the road, and trying to figure out where I was. Ahead of me, a dense fog filled the road. I slowed to a crawl as I came upon it and saw that it wasn’t behaving like a typical fog did. For one thing, it didn’t spread beyond a certain point in the road. It looked more like a wall *made* of fog. For a moment, I thought about doubling back and trying to find a different way home, but something inside me pressed me to continue. Wherever it was instinct or the voices on the radio communicating a warning, I’ll never know. \n\nInside the fog, visibility was close to nothing. Only a few feet ahead of the hood of my car. Wanting to focus my full attention on what was in front of me,  I tried shutting down the radio again, and nothing happened in response. As if to tell me this was a bad idea, the fog started glowing a preternatural crimson red. \n\n*Must be another car*, I thought to myself, and immediately dismissed the idea. Red headlights didn’t make sense. No car had red headlights unless it was a customized job. Even then, there was no practical reason for it. Red headlamps wouldn’t help to see in the dark. As I reasoned this out, the crimson light flashed over and over again making the fog look like a solid wall of blood. It made me feel lightheaded and weak. I wanted to look away from this, but I couldn’t. Crashing into something would be *very* bad. \n\nThe volume rose on the radio, and the music morphed into something that disturbed me deeply on a level that I haven’t since recovered from. It sounded like wind rushing through an empty field of desolation. Somehow, I recognized this from the sound alone. *I understood it*. It painted a picture in my mind of complete and utter emptiness. The loneliest place in the entirety of existence. Not only void of humanity, but of light, warmth, and hope.\n\n*This is Hell,* I thought, and I knew it to be the truth. I was more certain about this than my name.\n\nDriven near the edge of madness, I tried to push the button to shut off the radio. It didn’t work. I punched the console, hurting my hand, and breaking the plastic, yet nothing changed. Waves of anxiety, fear, panic, and rage made me feel as if I was about to explode from the inside out. Then mercifully, it stopped. \n\nThe voice of a child came on and spoke in a language I couldn’t understand. I’d bet my soul that no one else in the world would comprehend this language either. It was the language the dead and damned only spoke. Mid-way through her sentence, the voice morphed from a child's to a woman’s and said:\n\n*I want the hair all around.*\n\nIt returned to the child's voice, except there was a sound in the background all too familiar to me. It sounded like the inside of the warehouse I worked at. Forklifts were beeping. People shouting at each other. Trucks horns blaring.\n\nThen another voice shouted:\n\n*STOP TATTLING ON THIS SIDE!*\n\nA little girl answered:\n\n*I want to be old. No. No. No. No. NO. Tell he that is the sin. Tet. Tet. Tet. Tet.*\n\nAs the children argued in their forsaken language, the crimson lights darkened in the fog. It was almost as black as the deepest black hole in outer space. Despite the density of the fog and low visibility, I accelerated the car. I needed to escape the madness. I didn’t care if I died. Death would be welcome compared to the sheer, absolute terror I felt. It was beyond a physical response. I could feel my sanity slipping away. A part of my soul rejected being within me in this place of eternal damnation. \n\nThe second child stopped arguing with the girl, and it was her alone now speaking to me over the radio. Her voice morphed from a child's to a woman’s and then back again. It seemed to be using her voice to answer her back. \n\n*She died in the constabulary.*\n\n*Love gets us all.* \n\n*When was that?*\n\n*It is no more.*\n\n*London influenza.*\n\n*It's hot. It's hot. It's hot*\nAs their conversation continued, I felt a sudden pain in my mouth. I hadn’t realized it, but I'd chewed on my lower lip. Blood dribbled down my chin. My teeth were coated in a pink, frothy layer of blood. It was all I could do to stop from falling into the insanity threatening to overwhelm me. It worked better than I imagined. As the pain ebbed, the fog cleared. It went from the void of darkness back to grayish, and soon enough, it disappeared. \n\nThe road was clear again, but I still didn’t recognize where I was. I was overwhelmed with giddiness to be away from the fog. I drove onward, accelerating until I was going nearly 100. I wanted to get away as fast as I could from the nightmare behind me. There was only static on the radio now. No music. No voices. No children. Plain universal static. \n\n*Thank God*, I thought, and relaxed in my seat. A moment later, I passed an exit sign on the road and pulled off the highway. It wasn’t my exit, but I didn’t give a damn. I only wanted to be off the highway, and as far away as possible. \n\n*REPENT SINNERS! OR YOU SHALL BURN IN THE FIERY BLAZES OF HELL!*\n\nI nearly jumped out of my seat when I heard this come out over the speakers. The Bible-thumping radio host preacher continued spewing onward about the fornicators, homosexuals, and everyone else in the world he feared and loathed. I shut the radio off, and the car went quiet. I drove home listening to the buzz of the engine, fully awake now, and laughing my ass off at the preacher.\nWhat did he know about Hell and damnation?\n\nI arrived home close to 4:00 a.m., and I was exhausted. Yet, I couldn’t sleep. Over and over again, the entire episode replayed in my mind. The children arguing. The sound of the wind crying through the desolate field. Everything ricochets in my mind like a bullet that never stops.\n\nFor the next three days, I didn’t work. I couldn’t bring myself to drive on that road again. I also hadn’t slept in three days either. There was no way I was getting behind the wheel of a car or operating any heavy machinery at work. I stalked around the house like a zombie, out of my mind due to the lack of sleep, and those words and sounds, and feelings haunt me every moment. \n\nThe good news is that after the fourth day of not sleeping, and almost out of my mind with exhaustion, the thoughts finally started to go away. The voices no longer invaded my mind. The music, if you could call it that, stopped playing with the sound of the wind blowing against the house or the ceiling fan blowing overhead. \n\nWith the help of alcohol and strong narcotics, I was finally able to get to sleep again. I slept for nearly an entire day. There were no nightmares or thoughts about that night. There were only pleasant dreams of fast cars, beautiful women, and earthly delights. Maybe my subconscious was attempting to reorient itself again with something pleasant. I don’t know. \n\nIt’s been a long time since this happened. I don’t work at that warehouse anymore. I quit only a few days later and found employment in another company in the opposite direction of the highway I drove on that night. Not that I think it would have made a difference. Frankly, I don’t think about it much anymore. It isn’t something I want to dwell upon. These days, it is all a distant memory. Like a dream, you barely remember after waking up from it.\n\nI don’t listen to the radio anymore either. I’ve replaced terrestrial radio with podcasts, music, and audio books. No need to go searching for radio stations amidst the static of the airwaves. White noise and other sounds of that variety tend to bother me now. They used to feel comforting to have in the background at times. Now, I’d rather sit in complete silence.\n\nBut, of course, I am only human. People tend to tempt fate, even after avoiding tragedy. There are times when I’m driving, and I only do this during the daytime, surrounded by traffic, when I’ll tune into the FM band, and settle upon 91.1. There’s nothing ever playing there. I guess in my area, it isn’t a channel that’s used. I settle upon it and listen for words or music within the static. \n\nAnd yes, I’ve heard things. Whether it’s my mind searching for meaning in the white noise or I’m still attuned to the broadcast of the dead and damned, [I’ll never know.](/r/MacabreAvenue)",

        "text": "**knock knock knock!!** It’s the middle of the night, I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep, but I keep hearing this loud knocking on the door **knock knock knock** I tried to ignore it hoping whoever it is goes away. **knock knock knock** I have exams tomorrow I needed to sleep but this person doesn’t seem to want to leave. **knock knock knock** Whenever I try to check through the peephole I see no one, maybe they were just a bunch of kids playing a prank on me, I thought to myself. **knock knock knock** I wanted to see who it is so I waited until the knocking returns……………..\\*knock knock knock\\* “THERE IT IS!” I immediately looked trough the peephole but all I found was a bunch of…..”NOTHING?” I step back to think. **knock knock knock** “maybe they’re just really short? YEAH! THAT’S IT!” I thought to myself being proud of what a genius I am. **knock knock knock** This time I wanted to open the door and catch them in the action after I hear knocking. I waited and waited but I couldn’t hear any knocking.  “Huh, maybe they gave up?” Confused and tired I turned around to go back to- **knock knock knock** “AHA!” I shouted, but nothing, I saw nothing. I knew something was wrong my heart started raising and I started to sweat a little. I closed the door and thought to myself once again **knock knock knock** “If there’s no one through the peephole and no one outside the door, then it’s probably just………… a recording!” **knock knock knock** I snapped my fingers feeling smart and quickly tried to look for a recorder, I tried to know where the location is, so I walked away to the door trying to see how far I can hear the knocking. \n\n**knock knock knock** I came to the conclusion that obviously the sound was coming near the door but what I didn’t know is where it exactly is near the door. **knock knock knock** I pressed my ear against the door, and then **knock knock knock** I was shocked, I heard the knocking in the door like what you actually hear when someone knocks on the other side.  **knock knock knock** I got really confused I was certain that there was no one outside, I had double check it **knock knock knock** “I’m still right, no one there”. I stood there for a while trying to come up with a solution but I got nothing. **knock knock knock** My head started to hurt from all the thinking, “I want to save my brain power for the exams” I said. I then promptly gave up trying to solve this mystery so I turned around and walked towards my room, but as I turned around, I heard something “knock knock knock” I heard knocking, but its not actually knocking it's like someone imitating a knocking sound. It sounded like one of those witches in the cartoons I watched as kids but the voice was.....deeper and creeper.....so...much....creepier. \n\nI turned around and froze looking at the door, I said with a trembling voice, “Hello?” It then spoke to me “3 knocks, 3 opportunities, 3 mistakes” It then laughed horrifically and the doorknob started shaking and the door moving violently, I bolted to my room locked the door and hide underneath my blanket I don’t know what happened after that I just woke up the next day and it felt like it never happened, I must have fallen asleep as a coping mechanism from the fear and fatigue I accumulated that night. I went to school, did well on the exam, and came back home. But every night it always comes back, why? why does it have to always come back? Knocking again every night, I ignore it as much as i can and that seemed to work for now. Everyday my classmates notices me gradually being more tired and get eyebags from the lack of sleep. I would loved to say I could've just moved, but i was just a college student with no money living rent free in an apartment my parents lent to me. \n\nI don’t know how to get rid of it…. But what I do know is that every night the knocking gets louder and louder and my ears bleeding, making it even harder to sleep. The laugh growing louder and more maniacal. I don’t what will happen next, no one believes me, all the recordings I captured from one of the nights got corrupted for unknown reasons, pictures suddenly disappearing, videos plays an entirely different file whenever i try to show it to my friends, I don't know what else can I do, I'm scared.   \n\n\nupdate: hello, it's me my name is ----------- and I am the one who posted my experience in this website. I just wanted all of you to know, I am doomed, the door is broken the laughing is now inside the apartment, but **knock knock knock** the knocking still continues. I don't know what to do, my phone isn't working I am hiding in a secret room that my dad built when he used to live here when he was in college. I get a stinging suspicion that I was not the only one who experienced this. **knock knock knock** oh no.... it's getting closer, my dad might have fooled it by hiding in this place, but whose to say it won't be fooled twice? I hope I survive this ni-----  \n\n\nupdate: ḫ̶̮͋e̸̪͆ ̴̙̍͜i̶͍̿̑s̴̭̋ ̵̻̼̍n̴̟̆͑o̶̪͘̕t̶̛̬̩͂ ̷̮̾͜ẖ̵̨̆͠e̵͕̦̾ȑ̸͈͠e̴̳͚͘ ̴͕̉͋n̸̳͓̋͘ơ̸͚̇ẉ̸̠̇͝,̷̪̫̍ ̴̛̩̭I̴̯͂̌ ̴̼̤̈́h̸̺͗͜a̷͈͋̐v̷̗̫̔e̴̫͇̽̔

        "text": "**“Will Chameleon Man and his friends be able to stop the evil Toad from commencing his evil plan? Or will the fate of the universe be at stake to this slimy salesman? Tune in next week to find out!”**\n\nThe blaring yet catchy theme of *The Adventures of Chameleon Man and Friends* played over the overhead speakers as I walked out my office.\n\nI looked up from a clipboard of paperwork at my next patient: a young boy named Oliver Hughes; he was having trouble sleeping, and so far I wasn’t sure how to help him. I greeted him with a smile and he waved half-heartedly, paying more attention to the television, feeling dismayed that he missed the Chameleon Man episode.\n\nI was about to welcome him into my office when I remembered I’d forgotten my notes about Oliver in the filing room. I told him to wait, and he continued to stare at the screen.\n\nI walked over to my files, assuming that Oliver’s father, who was currently reading the newspaper, and my assistant Glenn would keep an eye on him.\n\n“Look!” Oliver shouted. “It’s Chameleon Man!”\n\n“Alright bud!” I shouted back. “I’ll see him too just in one sec.”\n\nI opened the O section of the filing cabinets and searched for his file.\n\n“It’s just like on TV! You have to see this!” I heard a loud shushing from someone else in the room, probably from Glenn.\n\nConfused, I shut the cabinet. The file wasn’t there but I caught a glimpse of it out of the corner of my eye. It was on the floor, half-opened amongst a handful of other files; almost as if someone had been going through it and dropped it. It was probably Glenn though my mind did jump to an intruder for a brief moment.\n\nI heard Oliver again, this time badgering his father, “Can I go with Chameleon Man?” \n\n“Chameleon Man is not real,” I could practically hear the eye-roll all the way here. \n\n“But he’s–”\n\n“I’ll not have another word.”\n\nI finished returning the files back to the cabinet and walked out, back into the lobby. I scanned the room and something was wrong. Something I couldn’t exactly–\n\nOliver was gone.\n\nHis father was still engrossed in the news. He hadn’t noticed. I looked around, and Glenn wasn’t at the register; instead I eyed him walking down the toilet down the hall.\n\n“Where’s Oliver?” I asked his father, confused.\n\n“Isn’t he with you?” he replied, not looking up from the paper.\n\n“No?” I puzzled. “I told him to stay here-he was just talking to you.”\n\n“Maybe he went to the toilet or something,” he groaned.\n\nI walked over to Glenn, just as he reached the lobby. “Did you see Oliver?” \n\n“No?” Glenn shrugged. “I thought he was with his dad.”\n\n“What the hell?” I swore. “Where is he?!” I began to panic now. I thought back on the spilled folder on the floor-could an intruder have gotten in? Did anyone see them? Surely someone would have seen *something*.\n\n“Glenn-” I was about to call Oliver’s father, but I decided not to, “we need to find him NOW.”\n\nI felt a brush of wind and noticed that someone had left the door a crack open. I pointed to it and nodded to Glenn.\n\nWe were on our feet before anyone could say another word. We ran outside, feeling the hellish summer heat. I searched the playground and the neighborhood while Glenn looked around the nearby shops. We needed to find Oliver.\n\nBut he wasn’t there. No matter how hard or where we looked he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI sighed in exhaustion, sweating profusely as we walked back to the clinic. “We need to call the cops. I don’t know what else to do.”\n\nAnd then I noticed something odd. Something I couldn’t explain.\n\nThere was a handprint on the plexiglass door, and it was definitely not human. The fingers were longer than *human* fingers and there were five fingers though the groupings were wrong. Three fingers were on the right side, and two were on the left.\n\nRight, and there were noticeable scrape marks on the glass.\n\nConfused and defeated, we went back inside. I saw Oliver’s father, still reading as if nothing had happened. I sighed and reached for the phone.\n\nIt took a whole hour for the cops to arrive.\n\nAnd when they did arrive, it didn’t seem like they cared at all. “High and mighty” Chief Pritchard was eating the last crumbs of a donut and ordering a young new-looking officer to go buy more from the shop across the street.\n\nEqually defeated as me, the officer ran off into the distance.\n\n“So how can I help you today?” Chief Pritchard said, licking the sprinkles off his lips.\n\n“A boy named Oliver Hughes went missing at two,” I informed. “I called you an hour ago. Anything could have happened to him.”\n\n“Maybe he just ran away,” the chief replied indifferently. “He’ll be back eventually.”\n\n“No. He isn’t the type,” I sternly rebutted. “I’m his doctor. And what you need to do is-”\n\n“Okay, okay,” he shrugged nonchalantly. “I’ll have them comb the area in an hour.”\n\n“In an hour?! We have to find him now! Isn’t time of the essence because-”\n\nThe chief walked away, meeting the younger officer running towards him, panting and huffing. He smiled greedily as he snatched the box of donuts. His greedy smile quickly turned to frown.\n\n“Buckley!” he hollered. “Are you deaf?! I asked for chocolate glazed donuts and you bought cream-filled donuts?!”\n\n“I’m sorry, Chief, they ran out–” the young man stammered.\n\n“Enough with the excuses!” The chief angrily stormed away with the box, pushing Officer Buckley to the side and he marched to buy donuts.\n\nOfficer Buckley sighed and sat, looking crushed. I went over to him and asked him, “What’s wrong with the chief?”\n\n“Ever since the previous chief Edwards retired and Pritchard got put in charge, we haven’t been actual cops,” he replied in dismay. “But me and some of the good ones are here to help in any way possible.”\n\n“Alright,” I responded, then proceeded to tell him everything I knew. In contrast to the chief, Officer Buckley was calm, collected, and took notes on everything I said.\n\n“Listen,” he started, “Chief Pritchard is going to forget about all this by the time he has his next snack. But I’ll see what I can do about arranging a search party. I’ll call your office if we get any more info.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nChief Pritchard was back now, a box of donuts in one hand and the other stuffing his face. How did this guy ever get promoted?\n\n“Right,” he began, crumbs spilling out of his mouth as he talked. “What were we doing here, let’s go!”\n\nWith that, they sped away and almost crashed into a tree. And after that, there wasn’t anything else I could do. So I called it a day in the office.\n\nI went over to the library, logging onto a computer and searching up for more information, to see if any other children had gone missing to no avail.\n\nFeeling like nothing could be done about this, I dragged myself home taking a glance at a board, and to my horror I saw three missing children posters.\n\nThey all had descriptions of where they were last seen and what they were last seen wearing and a number to call. Oliver wasn’t the only kid to go missing and I was determined to get down to the bottom of this. If the cops weren’t gonna do it, I will.\n\nI spent the rest of my day thinking about the case, trying to remember if anything had stuck out at me, anything that could be considered as foul play. But as hard as I thought, I couldn’t think of anything. Well, except the handprint on the door.\n\nOfficer Buckley had took a picture of it, though, and I was sure he was competent enough to find out what exactly it was.\n\nI hung up the phone. I thought about going back to the library- maybe I’d missed something. I even got so far as to open my door when I noticed there was a storm raging outside.\n\nSighing, I finished my dinner, took a shower, brushed my teeth- all that, hopped into bed and closed my eyes. Sleep, at last. \n\nAnd I dreamt of the strangest things. Chameleons and television. Starring Chief Pritchard as the evil toad. Chameleon Man, an alligator, a snake and a turtle were battling the Toad while children looked on, in anticipation of what happened next. And then-\n\nI woke up, awakened from slumber by a terrible noise. I glanced at the clock. It was two in the morning.\n\nThe noise continued, a screeching kind of thing, like metal against metal. It continued for a second and then **POP!**\n\n*Screech… pop!* And again. *Screech… pop!* And again.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and put on my glasses, confused. The sound was coming from opposite the room, behind the closed curtains that I’d gotten to prevent a particularly bright street lamp from keeping me awake.\n\n*Screech……****POP!***\n\n“What the hell?” *Screech…………………****POP!***\n\nI got up and walked towards the curtain as the sound continued. I heard the rain patter against the window as I neared.\n\nI heard the pop louder this time and I threw open the curtains revealing-\n\nI yelped in terror as I saw something that chilled me to the bone. It was *Chameleon Man*. It was *Chameleon Man*. In the flesh.\n\nThe uncanny bipedal thing stood outside my window, a single palm pressed up against the glass, fingers long and separated *just like the handprint at the clinic*. Its eyes were bulbous, glassy and black and it shimmered eerily against the rain.\n\nIt stuck out a long pink tongue and began to lick my window. It was a slow, delicate movement finished by what looked to be a single suction cup at the end of its tongue, which came off with a POP!\n\nAnd it continued, almost hypnotically. I doubted that what I was seeing was real. \n\nAnd in a flash, it was gone. Colours shifting and changing as Chameleon Man cloaked himself, becoming one with the rain. I heard a final pop against the window as I watched, entranced. \n\nConfused and lacking judgement, I fell right back asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was sure that it was all a nightmare. And yet the curtains were open. I edged towards the window, now horrified to see a familiar handprint on the glass.\n\nAnd the more I thought about the whole experience, the more it seemed all too familiar. It was almost as if I’d seen- no- heard it all before.\n\nThat was it! One of my patients, Rosa, had been talking about that Chameleon Man. One, almost coincidentally I was due for an appointment with her an hour from now.\n\nRight, I still had to go to work. \n\nI got my things ready, and poured a box of corn flakes sponsored by Chameleon Man himself. They tasted sour to my lips as I bit through them. Touched by the slimy claws of Chameleon Man. Or it was probably the fact that my milk was coagulated and spoiled.\n\nI gotta buy more milk later, I thought as I began my walk to work. Once again I passed the board with all the missing children’s posters on it, which now included Oliver.\n\nI heard a noise then, a rapid succession of clicking, right behind me. I whizzed around, seeing nothing. \n\nI heard the noise again- the clicking now coming from a bush. I began to back now as the bushes began rustling. No wind could be felt, and no animal was hiding beneath- no, not all of them all at once.\n\nAnd then I sighed in relief as a raccoon burst out of the bushes, a bug in hand. It paused, right in front of me and began to eat it.\n\nThat’s when it vanished. It was snatched away like a flash of lighting, swung to the side and into nothingness. I saw a silhouette of something *other* as I backed away faster. Blood appeared on the side walk and-\n\nI ran. I ran before whatever invisible thing that was devouring the racoon could take me too. And before I knew it, I was safe in my office, 5 minutes before my next appointment.\n\nQuickly, I headed to my files, opened it and took out the files I needed. Rosa Lopez. I saw what I feared there too- she had been talking about seeing Chameleon Man outside her window, licking and popping, and even in broad daylight, gesturing towards itself as if to invite her with it.\n\n*So it lured the children to come with it?* I thought. \n\nGlenn led Rosa and her mother into my clinic. I greeted the young girl, and we soon headed into my office. She too, was coming for sleep problems, just like Oliver. Perhaps- I thought, *perhaps they both- and all the other missing people saw Chameleon Man.*\n\n“Hi, Rosa,” I greeted, sitting down on my rolling chair. \n\nThe poor girl was too flustered to speak until her mother nudged her. “Good morning, Dr. Howell,” she whispered.\n\nAfter a bit of small talk with her mother, I finally decided to point the conversation into the direction I wanted.\n\n“I want to know about Chameleon Man- not the show, but the one you see outside your window, licking your window,” I inquired.\n\nRosa’s expression changed from composed to fear. “He’s still there- but he didn’t come yesterday.”\n\n“Alright,” I murmured. “Anything else?”\n\n“But he doesn’t only come at night, you know,” she continued. This was new. “I saw him this morning, too! I was watching his show on TV and then he showed up outside the window- he looked nice in the daytime- but my mommy always says not to trust strangers.”\n\nI sighed in relief. A question popped into my head. “This is going to sound weird, but has any of your friends seen Chameleon Man too?”\n\n“Oliver was talking about seeing him all the time and wanting to go with him. I saw my two friends Cody and Ava going off with him.”\n\nCody. Ava. Those names stuck shivers down my spine. Some of the kids whose names were on the board at the library. \n\nThe rest of the session was devoid of any other information. Normal, even. But now I was more confused. What was this thing- the actor of Chameleon Man- they did film not too far away- or something else.\n\nI would have to talk to Buckley about this, and before I knew it, I was at the police station.\n\n“So you’re saying your patient saw him?” he questioned.\n\n“Not just her,” I continued. “Her friends- and Oliver saw it too. She even saw one of her friends lured by him *into the woods.*” I paused, and then went on. “And I think I saw him too.” I explained that I’d seen him outside my window, watching me- although I didn’t say anything about the licking, or the fact that he vanished before my eyes.\n\n“Okay,” he murmured. “It might be someone from the show. I think I can convince Pritchard this is a big enough case to deal with- he’ll think it’ll make him get promoted some more or something.”\n\n“Good,” I nodded. “Call me if you know more.”\n\n“Will do–”\n\n“BUCKLEY!” the chief interrupted. “What are you doing talking to that man?! Get back to work!”\n\nBuckley sighed and went back to work and I too returned to the office to see a few more patients. Before I knew it, it was seven o’clock, the time I closed the clinic, and on my way home, I passed by a small grocery store, bought the milk I needed. \n\nVery soon, I was home. I turned on the TV, just as the phone started ringing. I rushed to my phone, picking up Buckley’s call.\n\n“Hello? Officer Buckley, anything?”\n\n“I don’t know if it is,” he began, “but look at the news. We do have a suspect.”\n\nI focused on the news. The Chameleon Man actor David Montgomery had been arrested over suspicions of being linked to a slew of missing children statewide.\n\nThe TV promptly played a leaked clip of the incident. Some officers were fighting with the actors, who were attempting to stop them. The chief was there too, patting himself on the back, although he seemed content not doing anything.\n\nAlthough Montgomery, still in costume, yelled that he was innocent, he was forced into a police car in handcuffs anyway. The director protested but the cops shoved him away.\n\n“So is it him?” I asked.\n\n“Chief thinks it is,” Buckley replied. “But not me. The others who were on set with him are his alibi.”\n\n“Could it be someone working with him? Or another actor kidnapping kids?” I theorized. \n\n“We're looking into that,” Buckley assured. “Some of the other actors have a criminal record, but nothing including children. But I found something weirder, though.”\n\n“Wha-” I coughed, a plume of dust falling onto my head. “Sorry, what?”\n\n“It’s not just our town,” he continued. I heard a thumping on the ceiling, and several more dust clouds began to fall. “It's been happening statewide. Children seeing Chameleon Man and disappearing a few days later.”\n\n“Really?” I asked. “So its not just–” I stopped halfway when I heard a thud on my TV. It fell over, falling onto the carpet. I heard a clicking sound next, a rapid succession of clicks and clacks that was eerily familiar.\n\nAnd then the thing appeared out of nowhere, right on the fallen TV set, lips laced with blood and bulbous glassy eyes that stared into my soul.\n\n“Chameleon Man,” I said, right before the thing charged, and pounced.\n\n“Wha-” I heard Buckley say, right before I haphazardly threw the phone at the monster. It hissed, and I backed only to trip on a pillow.\n\nThe thing snarled in anger and now I was throwing anything I could find at it, pillows, blankets, anything. Nothing seemed to work so I ran for my life, opening the door and slamming it shut. I sighed in relief as I locked it shut, trapping the thing inside my house.\n\nAs I backed away, the knocking stopped. I heard a familiar click and then- CRASH!\n\nThe humanoid lizard burst through a window, eyes on me and bits of glass on its skin. I ran for my life, hoping that someone would see me. But no matter what, nobody was there- everyone was fast asleep.\n\nAnd the thing was fast on my trail- just as I saw a familiar place- the police station. I thanked the universe that I lived close to the station.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my leg and fell over. The thing had sunk its sharp teeth into and tore at it, but I kicked it on the head all my might, briefly slowing it down. With the rest of my strength, I dashed to the police station, seeing a very confused Buckley welcome me in.\n\n“Close the door!” I shouted. “Chameleon Man is out there!”\n\n“What?” Buckley gasped. His nincompoop of a boss was there having a nap.\n\n“Close the door!” I repeated.\n\n“The actor?” he asked. “We arrested him- he got sent to one of the larger stations a few cities away.”\n\n“No-” I pointed at the monster that was rapidly approaching. “That!”\n\nOfficer Buckley’s face turned pale white from horror and shut the doors and locked it, just as Chameleon Man slammed into it, waking the sleeping beast- Chief Pritchard from his slumber.\n\n**BANG!**\n\nChameleon Man slammed in once more. **BANG!** \n\n“The hell’s making that noise?” Chief Pritchard demanded. The banging continued. “Open the door!”\n\n“That thing is no man,” Buckley murmured. “Something unnatural.”\n\nChief Pritchard ignored him and lazily walked towards the door. Chameleon Man slammed in once more and began to tear at it- and suddenly, a piece of the wooden door shattered.\n\nThrough the large hole we saw the face of Chameleon Man, grinning with blood-laced lips. Chief Pritchard shouted and ran, just as the monster burst in.\n\nThe chief instantly made it to a small holding cell and locked himself in- oh, the ONLY holding cell.\n\nI followed Buckley out to an emergency exit. We heard Chief Pritchard’s screams of terror- though we later learned he was fine, and that the monster merely tried to break the metal bars.\n\n“Car!” Buckley shouted, just as I heard the lizard’s hiss behind us.\n\nBuckley took the driver’s seat and I took his handgun. Chameleon Man slammed into the side, and he hit the pedal, slamming us right into Chameleon Man. We heard a slight hiss and then silence.\n\n“Is it dead?” I whispered, thinking aloud.\n\nAnd then we saw a headless shape rise up in front of us. *It was just the suit.* Its insides were nothing but black nothingness. It was a living, breathing costume.\n\nThe thing jumped onto the car roof, and Buckley hit the gas, knocking off and into the side of the road. And then we drove from there, trying to get away from the Chameleon Man- which had set its head back onto its body.\n\nWe saw the thing chase after us through the side mirrors, but soon, it was gone from sight.\n\n“Did we lose it?” Buckley asked, eyes on the road.\n\n“I…” I turned around and saw nothing, “I think so.”\n\n“Good, that’s-”\n\nChameleon Man erupted from the forest like a rabid dog and slammed into the side of the car. With hooked claws it began to climb, obscuring the glass and we crashed into a tree, but the force was enough to fling the living suit a distance away. But it was regaining itself now, despite the rips and tears into the fabric.\n\n“Get out!” Buckley shouted, kicking open the door. \n\nI tried, but I was stuck- the seatbelt was too tangled. Buckley found a pocket knife in his belt and cut me loose and with some difficulty, we climbed out of the fallen car and out into the open. Rain fell as we fumbled on the grass. Thunder and lightning shook the skies.\n\nAnd Chameleon Man was nearby too, rising up to his full height and snarling- no- roaring into the air.\n\nWe were at an abandoned military warehouse in the forest. Officer Buckley opened the door and pulled me inside, switching on his flashlight. Old-fashioned guns and some explosives sat on the shelves. Chameleon Man smashed through a shelf with ease, being hit on the head with several rifles.\n\nIt snarled and leapt at me, scratching  and tearing at me as Buckley began firing shots at it, yet nothing seemed to be able to stop it. The horror then dropped me and was about to kill me when the young officer grabbed shined his flashlight, luring the monster to him.\n\n“Come over here, you slimy reptile!” he shouted. Chameleon Man turned away from me and crawled towards him. Buckley ran to me and dragged me away, running out of the shed, just before closing the door, he threw a hand grenade at it.\n\n**KABOOM!**\n\nThe blast destroyed the whole shed, with Chameleon Man inside it. I stumbled down on the grass.\n\n“What was that?!” Buckley cried, panting, trying to bandage my arm.\n\n“Whatever it is, I just hope that that’s the last we see of it,” I shrugged.\n\nThough we didn’t know, miles away on the set of Chameleon Man, all in the dead of night, all the missing kids appeared out of thin air. Being at night, nobody saw them appear. When asked where they were, none could truly explain- at least nothing believable.\n\nThey told stories of another world, fighting the forces of evil with their favorite, though now feared character- *Chameleon Man*.\n\nAnd since the suit had been destroyed, nobody saw that wretched reptile ever again. The show’s ratings plummeted and it was eventually cancelled. Not long after, kids were all caught up in the latest new fad.\n\nBut sometimes I wondered, even now, decades after I’d last seen the thing. What exactly was it- a possessed suit- a demon? Was it alive? I didn’t know, but nevertheless still found myself trying to piece it all together. But that was the least of my concerns as the kids were back safe.\n\nI ended up moving to Oregon, but I kept regular contact with Buckley (whose first name is apparently Shannon), him updating me on the ongoings every once in a while, and I’d visit every so often.\n\nBut now, more than thirty years after the horrors, I'm hearing talks about starting a reboot of *The Adventures of Chameleon Man and Friends*. \n\nThe reason? A man by the name of Jeremy *Pritchard* (no doubt related to the chief) had found the suit.",

        "text": "It all started 12 years ago, and I can't stop it.\n\nMost of my childhood was average,  I lived with my younger sister Lilian who was 9 years old at the time, my mom, and my dad, I would dare to say I was happy before everything started.\n\nWe lived in a quiet town, one of those where you know everybody, where you don't pay any mind to the people around you, we were supposed to be safe, it all started when my sister disappeared.\n\nJust like that, we went to sleep after dinner that night and they were gone by morning time, just gone, erased, the only trace left behind, sitting on top of my bed, a letter read:\n\n*My new friend, we'll be gone for a while, I wanted to play, and I finally can, it's time for us to go but don't worry, and don't feel alone, I know how that feels and your sister will never feel that way again.*\n\n*ill come for you someday David.*\n\n*P.s. This letter is* ***only for you***\\*, you'll keep it safe for me, won't you? I know you will my good boy.\\*\n\nMy mother was the first one to notice her absence I still feel sick to my stomach just remembering the way she screamed when she noticed her daughter was gone, my dad rushed from downstairs to their room just to find my mom on the ground holding the little doll Lilian always kept in her arms, by the time the police arrived I had already found the letter, I wanted to tell them, I really did, but the words wouldn't come out, every time I tried to say something I just felt so sick, something about the way he wrote it  ❝***ONLY FOR YOU***❞ I knew what that meant, if I wanted to see my sister again I would keep my mouth shut, and so I did.\n\nThe police did their best, but after 2 months the trail went cold, the whole town had a dreadful feeling, that false sense of security that for so many years had loomed over us suddenly broke, and we were left with nothing.\n\nMy mom killed herself not two weeks after that, her heart couldn't deal with the pain and she slit her wrists in the bathroom at the bank where she worked, one of her coworkers found her, I would have cried but the day my sister disappeared I saw it in her eyes, she was already dead at that moment, and just like that my mom was dead, my sister was missing and the letter, the only thing I could think about was the letter, every night I read it, trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get my family back.\n\nI stopped going out, and people looked at me with a hateful sentiment, I was a reminder after all that the town was not a safe haven, instead of supporting us as they should have, they invented a story where I abused and killed my sister, that my mom couldn't take the guilt of covering up the truth anymore and that's why she killed herself, it was easier to blame me than to fear of the unknown.\n\nI knew the truth, I knew one of these bastards took my sister, it had to be someone from the town, it's just too much of a coincidence, why would they come here? why my house? it didn't make sense, I was alone in my room trying to figure it out, then I heard it\n\n”hey David” a dark, playful, and rusty voice that was filled with malice I couldn't quite locate said.\n\n”Who are you\" I responded trembling with fear.\n\n”Ohh silly David, how quickly you forget, you know who I am don't you??, as I told you before I'm your new friend of course\"\n\nAt that moment I realized, he was it, he took my sister, I started to scream at him  ”where the hell are you, bring back my sister you bastard”\n\n”hey hey David buddy play nice”, he said in a mocking way, ”do you want to see me?”  ”i can show you”\n\n”show me,” I said, at that moment my fight or flight instinct was frozen, I just wanted to run out of there, I couldn't move\n\nAnd from the darkest corner of the room he came out, a pale figure not human but not inhuman either, he was tall, taller than any regular human I've ever seen and his skin was almost white as if he hadn't been in the sun ever, I could see it in his eyes, whatever he was there was hell in his eyes, wide open, with a smile so cheerful almost maniac, he craved for death or at least that's what it looked like.\n\n”wha, ww,w, what the hell are you?” I said\n\nhis smiled disappeared and the cheerful and playful tone in his voice did too.\n\n”i told you, I'm your new friend”",

        "text": " \n\nWhen you’re a struggling stand up comic who refuses to quit, you’re on the road a lot. You stay in some pretty shady places because you’re broke as hell and also because you buy into this idea that it’s part of the lifestyle.\n\nIt’ll give you ideas or inspiration for the next bit that might make you go all the way. Even staying in a Motel 6 could anesthetize the Humor Muse. \n\nIn all these motels, you’ll always find two things, a curly hair in the sink and at least one painting on the wall. \n\nI think the people that own the sleazy places honestly think that a painting will class it up enough to somehow make you forget that the sheets are crusty or the room smells like bleach or that there are bullet holes in the ceiling above the bed.\n\nThe paintings are usually landscapes or seascapes with a horribly ornate floral frame of gold. They’re always hung over the bed, and they always make me laugh.\n\nFor the last three years, I have always taken a photo of said shitty paintings and posted it on my social media accounts. My face is always on the left side of the frame while the painting takes up the background. I always try to think of something clever to caption the photo.\n\nIt’s not terribly creative, but it’s a great way to interact with my few followers.\n\nI’ve been on the road for almost twelve years looking for my big break, and I’ve seen lots of shitty rooms and sorry paintings and taken lots of photos with a hack caption. \n\nOn Monday, I finally saw one that caught my attention in all the wrong ways.\n\nI was outside of Topeka and I got into this roadside rat haven around three in the afternoon. As I walked in, I glanced around the room and saw the usual accommodations, but the painting above the bed was anything but usual. \n\nIt was in a dark wood frame. The background was a foggy black swirl and a man wrapped in a dirty looking sheet was standing on a cracked and dry lakebed. \n\nNext to him there was a wreck of a small red row boat filled with cracks and holes along the side. Inside the boat was something covered by a tarp.\n\nOnly the slightest sliver of his face could be seen turning to his left; an almost imperceptible line of white. It looked like he was waiting to turn around and look at me. \n\nI dropped my bag on the bed and got close to the painting. I could make out the tiny brush strokes on its surface, and I could even see one little bristle that had fallen out of the artist’s brush and was buried by the raw umber paint that was streaked along the folds of the ghastly man’s sheet.\n\nIt gave me the creeps. Naturally, I took a photo.\n\nI had raised an eyebrow and had a quizzical look on my face. I captioned it thusly…\n\n“The man, like the audience, has barely any interest in looking at me. Whilst my career lies in a sad heap under a sheet in a boat going nowhere.”\n\nBefore I went on stage that night, I thought about the ghastly man in the painting. I thought about what it would take to get him and the audience to turn around and look at me. What would it take for everyone to notice me?\n\nI did three sets that night, and I killed. I didn’t do any of the material I had, I just went straight from inside. I even worked the painting into a bit about suffering for my art. I murdered. The energy I got was better than any drugs or alcohol that I’ve ever had.\n\nI had a few drinks after the show to celebrate and then I staggered my way back to the motel. The first thing I did when I walked into the room was waddle over to the painting to say thank you.\n\nI said my thanks for the inspiration and then I stared at the painting. Everything was the same, but I swore that the man’s face had moved. There was more of it.\n\nI could just make out the tip of his nose. I chalked it up to being drunk. I must have been imagining things.\n\nI didn’t sleep very well that night. I kept hearing things skittering around in the walls. I was sure they had mice, but for some reason, I just didn’t want to look at the painting hanging on the wall just above my head.\n\nI hit the road the next day and my phone was just blowing up. Every account had new followers. Apparently some people in the club the night before had recorded some of me, and it was getting some attention. \n\nSo many people were making comments about the terrible painting I had taken a picture with the night before.\n\nI stopped after five hours straight of driving in the middle of the country to get some gas. I took out my phone and I was going to start answering comments, but I stopped when I saw the photo.\n\nI could see even more of the face of the ghastly man in the sheet. What bothered me even more was that I could now see his left hand reaching towards the tarp in the boat.\n\nI shook my head and looked again. I knew that I had been really drunk the night before, but there was no way that I could have not noticed the man’s hand in the painting. \n\nWas there?\n\nI scrolled through the comments on my accounts. Lots of people were commenting about how creepy the thing was, but no one else seemed to notice anything about the painting changing.\n\nI drove for another two hours before I hit the next stop. Another fleabag motel. I walked into the room and immediately noticed that there was no painting anywhere within it. That was a first. \n\nI took a picture of me against the empty wall.\n\n“Looks like all you get is me tonight.”\n\nI sat down on my bed and opened my phone. I posted the new picture on all of my accounts. When I was finished, I looked at the picture that I had taken the night before. The man’s face had not moved, but his hand was now gripping the tarp in the boat.\n\nI put my phone down and got ready for my gig. I was imagining things.\n\nI did another three sets that night. I did even better than the night before. I had people in tears. It’s like the material was being downloaded into my brain just before I let it out. Even while I was saying some of it, I thought it wasn’t that great, but the crowds just ate it up.\n\nAfter the show, I looked back at my phone. More followers, more videos, more comments, and more changes in the painting.\n\nI could see the full side of the man’s face now. It was deformed. An open mouth and a cauliflower-like nose while his sloped brow encroached downward over his eye. His hand was pulling up on the tarp.\n\nI turned off my phone and drove back to the motel. As I tried to sleep that night, again I heard skittering in the walls and ceiling. More mice, I thought. It took me forever to fall asleep.\n\nYesterday, my next stop was only three hours away, so I slept in as long as I could, but I kept having dreams of that stupid painting. When I woke up, I felt like I hadn’t even slept at all.\n\nI grabbed my phone and turned it on. There was so much going on with all of my accounts, but I had no interest in checking in on them. I didn’t even want to see the photo. \n\nI called my brother instead.\n\nI asked him if he had seen the photo of the painting, and he told me that he had. I asked him to describe it to me.\n\n“Uh, ok. It’s some creepy sloth looking guy pulling a tarp out of a boat.”\n\n“Has it always looked that way?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Did you see the picture when I first put it up?”\n\n“Yeah, of course I did.”\n\n“It hasn’t changed since then?”\n\n“Has it changed? Since you posted it on your facebook…how high are you right now?”\n\nI got off of the phone and took a shower. I hadn’t had a break in over ten months. I thought I was tired. I began to think that maybe I needed to go back home and see my family, but then I thought of the crowds the last two nights. I had just started on a hot streak. I would be a fool to derail the train just as it was picking up steam.\n\nAfter my short drive, I checked into a motel. Again there was no painting on the wall, but this time there was an empty frame. I positioned my face directly in front of it.\n\n“Framed.” \n\nI couldn’t think of anything else. I was too fixated on the thought of that terrible painting.\n\nJust before I went on stage last night, I made the mistake of looking at my phone.\n\nI opened the picture directly from my phone rather than looking at what I posted.\n\nThe ghastly man in the sheet was looking directly at me now. His eyes were two little red dots barely looking out from under a cro magnon's forehead. His nose looked a deformed and rotting vegetable and his mouth was agape with only three crooked teeth peeking up from his gums. The tarp was hanging off the side of the boat, and there was a body lying inside. The ghastly man had his hands palms up at his sides.\n\nI began to sweat. \n\nI felt like puking, but then I heard my name. I took a deep breath and walked on stage.\n\nI flopped; at least I thought I did. The crowd loved it though. It was the weirdest thing. I stuttered, I lost my train of thought, and sometimes I could barely get a coherent word out. They didn’t care.\n\nI only did two sets last night, and they both went the same. Everyone backstage was even sucking me off and telling me how great I was. I had no idea what was going on.\n\nI sat down to collect my thoughts. My phone was blowing up again. I didn’t bother to look at any of that. Instead, I opened the photo. The ghastly man was pointing toward me with a dripping red finger and the body inside of the boat had changed. It was facing me, but there was no face, just a bloody mess.\n\nI called my brother.\n\n“Are you seriously calling me right now? Dude its after midnight!”\n\n“Just look at it Eddie!”\n\n“Dude, whatever you’re smoking, you need to stop. You’re getting paranoid.”\n\n“Are you looking at the picture yet?”\n\n“Yeah…just…hold your water man…um yeah, ok…same painting I was looking at earlier today when I wasn’t trying to sleep.”\n\n“What do you see?”\n\n“The same thing I saw earlier. Tobin, seriously, what is going on?”\n\n“I don’t know. Maybe…maybe I’m just tired of being on the road. Maybe I just need to come home.”\n\n“Listen, why don’t you get some sleep and then hit the road tomorrow. You can make it back here in, what, three days?”\n\n“Yeah probably. Eddie, I’m sorry I called you. I just freaked out is all.”\n\n“I understand. Honestly the painting is creepy as fuck anyway. If it’s bothering you that much, just delete it.”\n\n“Yeah, I think I will. I just…that thing in the painting…just freaked me out.”\n\n“What thing? The boat?”\n\n“No, the dude in the sheet.”\n\n“What the fuck are you talking about? It’s just a boat. It’s always just been a boat.” \n\n“You told me this morning that you saw the man.”\n\n“What the fuck are you talking about Tobin?”\n\nI hung up on him and opened the photo back up. \n\nThere it was. A background that was a foggy black swirl and a cracked and dry lakebed. A wreck of a small red row boat filled with cracks and holes along the side sat by itself. Inside the boat there was nothing.\n\nI drove back to the motel just outside of Topeka only stopping once for gas. I made it back just two hours ago and I managed to get the same room I had on Monday night.\n\nWhen I got inside, I looked at the painting above the bed. It was exactly what it was when I looked last. I opened my phone and I looked at the original post. There was no ghastly man in a sheet and there was nothing in the row boat.\n\nI turned to go back outside, but then something started knocking on the door to my room.\n\nThe knocking has been going nonstop for the last two hours. I’ve tried to make phone calls for help, but nothing is getting through. I looked through the tiny peep hole in the door only one time and all I could see was a red eye staring back at me.",

        "text": "We arrived at the location that Dr. Camber told us about. We looked around and saw a frozen lake and not much else. We were in the arctic circle of Northern Canada. We walked over to the lake and examined it. It didn’t propose much about what we were looking for. We cautiously stepped on the frozen water, testing to see if it would hold our combined weight. Once we were sure it could, we walked out into the middle. We were in the exact coordinates Dr. Camber sent us too. Nothing. We set up our supplies, and started making our way out, slowly looking around the lake. The ice was so thick, we couldn’t see the bottom. One member reached the edge of their area. “Falcon 1 this is Foxtrot 3, I have reached the edge. Nothing to see here.”\n\n“Foxtrot 3 this is Falcon 1, head on back over.” Falcon 1, our team leader responded. Foxtrot 3 started walking back, then immediately fell through the ice. I was the closest to his position and ran over. I stopped a few feet from the hole and slowly made my way over to make sure the edge would hold my weight. Once I was sure it would, I leaned over and stuck my head under water. What I saw blew the breath from my lungs in little bubbles. It was a pristine, white city. Shifting. Changing. Buildings combined, and broke apart. They changed shape. What amazed me most was that it was moving towards me. I saw foxtrot 3 trying to swim back up. “Foxtrot 3 this is Bluejay 2, do you copy?”\n\n“Bluejay 2 this is foxtrot 3, I do copy. Something is pulling me in. Send back up.”\n\n“Bluejay this is Falcon 1, leave foxtrot 3. Head back over.” I looked back at the white city, realizing it looked frozen for the first time. It had come closer, and a vortex was starting to form under the water. I noticed that weirdly the water was warm, while everything else was cold. Foxtrot 3 was directly in the middle of the vortex. The city still crept closer, and the pull of the vortex was starting to reach me. I pulled my head up and backed away. \n\n“This is Bluejay 2, calling out to everyone, back off the ice.” \n\n“This is Falcon 1, calling to everyone, you heard Bluejay 2. Pack it up and move.” Once all the supplies were packed up and moved safely away from the water. As soon as that was finished Falcon 1 started questioning me about what I saw. “What did you see Bluejay?”  \n“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you Falc. It was a city… A frozen city that was moving… Not just moving like locations but it was shifting. Changing… The buildings would combine, or break. And there was this… this weird vortex that started pulling Foxtrot in. The water was also warm, maybe like 26.6 degrees celsius. It was weird Falc. I don’t understand it. How did Dr. Camber know what was here?” \n\n“Those answers are above my paygrade Blue. But you did just start here right? This is your first field mission?” I nodded my head. “Well what you’re gonna see is only gonna get more weird Blue. Trust me.” I just stare at him, confused, worried, and most of all frightened. How could he be so calm about it? What had he seen before?\n\nI never got an answer to those questions. We packed up all the supplies and met at a rendezvous point, and got the hell out of there. I’m not sure what Dr. Camber wanted from there, and I don’t think I’ll ever find out. How Dr. Camber knew that was there, I’m not sure either. I’m not sure I want to know either. For now this is the end of my message. I have to be careful about what I put on here. If I get tracked I’ll get terminated. Permanently.",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying, I vivid lucid dream often. I know I am dreaming, decide what I will say and do, can wake myself up, as well as put myself back into the same dream after falling asleep again, etc. But this morning... this morning was different....\n\n\n\nI had woken up after only 5 hours of sleep and was lying in my bed trying to get a few more hours of shuteye.\n\n\n\nAs I began drifting off to sleep: It started off with a tunnel sound. This weird sound that I can only describe as a combination of when your going through a tunnel in the mountains when your ears are about to pop or you having a migraine. I felt it in the front of my face, the force of it. After about 3 seconds it would transfer to my ears, I'd hear it for a second and then they would ring like tenitis for a 2 seconds. Then it would stop for maybe 5 seconds and start again. On repeat. After about 6 times, I thought, \"oh this is weird... why is this happening? This usually doesn't happen in my dream or awake state. Am I dreaming?\" So, I woke myself up, looked around, \"yepp, I was falling asleep. Huh, that's odd but whatever, I'm tired. Happy I'm about to get more rest.\"\n\nI lie my head back on my pillow and the tunneling quickly starts again. Maybe 6-9 more times until I'm in my dreamstate.\n\n\"Waking up\" in my dream: I'm lying in bed in the exact same position in my room. Everything is identical to real life. I stretched my leg towards the center of the bed like I usually do sometimes. I feel something hard in the bed under the covers. \"What the f is that?\", I think. So I start pulling it out from under the covers... a snow scraper for the car windows. \"My boyfriend must've bought this, but why would we need it and why the hell is it in the bed? Ah, he mustv'e thrown it on the bed after coming back from the store and just forgot, whatever\", I think. I turn to go back to sleep and realise the four boxes of painting supplies I had left on the counter were on the bed. \"How petty of him\" I think \"He literally put it on the bed because I didn't clean it up lastnight?!\" *throw snow scraper into the hallway through the bedroom door* it breaks into pieces. \n\n\n\nWhen I notice somethings off: Still in bed with one eye open, I look at the snow scraper sitting in pieces in the hallway..it was alone. Along with it was an old maraca I had and another children's toy. Me and my boyfriend don't have a child, nor a maraca. \"Okay, I'm dreaming. Weird for me to wake up in the exact position I had fallen asleep it, but that wouldn't be a first. Whatever, boring dream. I'm going back to bed\" (aka about to fall asleep in my dream and switch to a new dream)...nope.\n\n\n\n\"I shouldn't be able to do this\": I turn to fall asleep and notice there is a menu board, like the one you would see sitting outside a shop, with a black background with menu items written on it in neon green marker, sitting between the doorway that leads to the hallway and my closet door. \"Wait! I can read this! Like, I can see all the letters and they make sense, not like I just 'know' what it says... I can actually read this!\" *start reading the board* \"Wait! Why can I read this? I shouldn't be able to read in my dreams\", I think. *I squint with my one open eye*  The words get fuzzy for a second but then come back. I close both eyes and reopen the other one (I still feel tired in my dream, and I'm hoping to go \"back to bed\" soon.)\n\n\n\n\"Is it trying to show me there's one more child?\": Now, there's a TV where the menu board sat. An old-style tv from my childhood. Showing me a picture of me with family as a child, a picture I remember fondly. Then it flashes and displays another picture. The same as the picture before but with an extra child about my age. Then, it flashes again and a new picture appears. Just like the last, it was a childhood picture I remembered fondly. Again, the picture that follows is the same, but with another child. This happens for about 5 pictures until \"my mother\" walks in. I put \"my mother\" in quotes because she looks exactly like my mother 20 years ago but has significantly more calming and lighthearted ora, like that of my grandmother. Deciding that this woman could definitely not be my dark cloud of a mother, I greet her according to her vibe \"Hi, grandma\". She looks at me and says \"Oh, I forgot something\" and walks out. Back to the tv I look...\n\n\n\n\"The extra\": Still, with one eye open, I watch this tv as it displays pictures I know first how I remember them and then with a child added. My eye is getting tired, *switch eye that's open*. A girl, about my age now, frozen midwalk at the foot of my bed. Old white nightcap over her head and eyes. She's 2 feet from walking directly into a wall.. frozen. 2 seconds is enough to read this situation...\"nope!\" *I switch eyes again, hoping that the change will bring me back to what I was doing before I switched eyes and saw her*. It did... but I couldn't help it...I couldn't control my eyes. Call it morbid curiousity, but something in me was curious to find out if she was the extra in the photos. *I switch back*\n\n\n\n\"Come join us!\": The girl, still standing there frozen about to walk into a wall. \"Yeah idk what I was thinking, bad idea. Both eyes, close now. Time to wake up\", I think. The girl, directly in front of me now, clearly frozen no longer, speaks \"Hey, what are you doing? Come on! Come join us, let's go!\" She says in the cheery voice you would expect a sister about your age to talk to you. She grabs me by the arms, I feel her hands touch my skin and my body start to lift off the bed. \"I just saw this girl fn frozen walking to nothing. No way in hell am I about to let her just guide me somewhere,\" i think. My eyes still closed, I can feel my body floating off the bed. I'm waiting for my feet to touch the ground. In my head I'm screaming, but in this place my mouth is only open about an inch, half plagued by the paralysis of fear. I say \"no. babe?! babe?!\" Calling out for my boyfriend because I'm starting to worry.. I still I haven't woken up. \"Babe?!\" *I wake up*\n\n\n\nAwake again, really: I look at the time... about 40 minutes had passed. Never do my dreams align timewise like this. I call my sister, tell her what happened and she says \"You didn't go with them, did you? Why did you say hi? You never say 'hi'...they take it as an invitation. Next time this happens, just act like you can't read, like you aren't aware. I'm so happy you got out.\"",

        "text": "I was ten when I told my mom about the pale lady in the wardrobe. She had long limbs and paper-white skin. She killed Marlene, my babysitter, right in front of me, and I watched as she dragged Marlene’s body into the wardrobe. She smiled at me as she climbed in after her.\n\nI told mom everything. I told her to get help and call the police. We could save her if we tried. We could help Marlene.\n\nBut mom didn’t believe me, nor did she care. Mom was very drunk and relieved she didn’t have to pay Marlene for watching me. She waved me away and pulled the man she had brought back into her room. She closed the door in my face.\n\nShe believes now, though. Oh yes, she does. But too little too late.\n\n It should have been her.\n\nI’m upset and scared, but more than anything, I am pissed. My mother’s stubbornness has irrevocably broken so many people.\n\nMy baby sister is the biggest victim of it all.\n\nI know we won’t ever find her.\n\nAs I’ve said before, Marlene was my babysitter. She was very nice and also very dumb. She once asked me what the Spanish word for tortilla was.\n\nMom loved to date almost as much as she loved to drink. Almost. Is it sad to say that I saw Marlene more than mom? If so, too bad because it’s the truth.\n\nMom was on another date that night. She told us not to wait up for her.\n\nMarlene and I were watching tv in the living room. She had put a frozen pizza in the oven and went to check on it. She was in the kitchen for less than a minute when she began to scream.\n\nI jumped to my feet, my heart beating so hard it hurt. Marlene ran into the room; her eyes were wide and terrified.\n\n“Run!” she shrieked at me. “Mariah, run!” My feet didn’t want to move; Fear glued me to the floor.\n\nMarlene grabbed me around the waist, and we ran out the front door. There was no moon and barely any stars.\n\nEverything was black\n\nI had regained my ability to move. I ran fast, and so did Marlene.\n\nWe had nearly reached Marlene’s car when I looked back, and I saw her. It was a woman. She unfurled herself from the house, limbs dangling. She had to be at least ten feet tall, and her pale skin gleamed in the dark.\n\nIt didn’t take her long to catch up to us, but it should have been me. Marlene pushed me hard, and I fell to the ground.\n\nShe saved me, and I could only watch as the woman grabbed her and took her back inside the house.\n\nMarlene screamed so loud for so long, but it didn’t matter. Mom and I lived on a street full of rotting or empty houses. There was nobody but us.\n\nThe woman must have lived in the house all along. And when we moved in, we were the trespassers. We were encroaching on her territory.\n\nThe last time I saw, Marlene was as the woman took her into the wardrobe. She wasn’t screaming anymore, but blood was running from her nose. Her eyes were full of tears.\n\nI watched her, and she watched me.\n\nThey never found Marlene. It’s not as though they really looked for her. Her home was as broken as mine was.\n\nI dreamed of Marlene often. I dreamed that I watched as the woman held her in her fist and squeezed. I listened to her bones crunch and saw her intestines spill out of her mouth. Brain matter leaked out of her ears, and her eyes formed gelatinous tears on her cheeks.\n\nShe had cared for and saved me. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her. I looked for her every day until the day I left for college.\n\nI never found any trace of her.\n\nI saw traces of the woman, though. Occasionally, I would glimpse her from the corner of my eyes. Her long arms would creep into the room and then slither out of sight. Once, I saw her reflection in the mirror as I brushed my teeth.\n\nShe only appeared when mom was out of the house, so I made sure never to be home alone. When I moved out, I moved across the country. I barely talked to mom.\n\nHowever, I spoke to Lizzy, my baby sister. Mom became pregnant with her when I was 17. I begged mom to move repeatedly, but she never listened to me.\n\nLizzy was ten. I told her about the house, but never about the pale lady. I told her never to be alone, and she listened; she had been safe.\n\nBut mom had gone to the bar during the night, and when she came home, Lizzy was gone.\n\nThere were claw marks on the door and a dark stain on the bed. The wardrobe was partially askew.\n\nIt had happened. The woman had taken her.\n\nMom was drunk and half crazy in grief. She asked me what to do.\n\n“Call the cops and look in the wardrobe,” I told her. “Find her! It might not be too late.”\n\nShe did and called back a moment later.\n\n“They said they’re on the way,” she sobbed.\n\n“Good. Are you by the wardrobe?”\n\n“Yes, yes. Oh, Mariah, her sock is on the floor. It’s drenched with b b b blood. Oh, Mariah, you were right. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”\n\nI hung up on her.\n\nI replayed the last conversation I had with my sister in my head. It would haunt me forever.\n\n“Mariah,” Lizzy whispered to me over the phone. “Mariah! Mom’s gone!”\n\n“What do you mean she’s gone? It’s almost midnight.”\n\n“I know! I woke up to go to the bathroom, and she’s not here!” Lizzy was near tears. I tried to stay calm for her, but it was hard. I felt dread crawling over my skin like a spider.\n\n“I think she went to the bar again. She’s been drinking a lot.”\n\n“Fuck,” I said, not bothering to censor myself. This was very bad. “Where are you?” I asked. I already knew.\n\n“In the house,” Lizzy whimpered. “In the house alone.”\n\n“Lizzy, get out of the house now. Run, run until you’re on the next street over. Fuck, no run until you reach the bar. There should be people there. I’m on my way. I’m going to book a flight right now. I’m taking you to live with me.”\n\nIt sounded so easy, a fantastic plan. It would be okay; it would be fine. I would fly to my sister and bring her back with me.\n\nEverything would be okay.\n\nBut it was too late. Fear immobilized Lizzy as it had with me all those years ago.\n\n“I hear something,” she whispered to me. “There’s something right outside the door.”\n\n“Mom?” I said, hopefully knowing that it wasn’t.\n\n“No, no…” Lizzy breathed, and her voice sounded muffled. “It’s not mom. I’m under the bed right now. It’s a woman…She’s, she’s whispering to me.” She gasped. “She’s in the room. She’s talking to me.”\n\nI couldn’t say anything. I burst into tears.\n\nLizzy was crying, too. “She says she remembers you. She remembers hearing you scream and pound on the door. She says that every day you would walk around the house looking for the girl. The one she killed.”\n\n“Lizzy, stop talking!” I yelled. “Lizzy, I’m on my way!”\n\nI grabbed my keys and ran to the door. Yes, I was in my pajamas, and yes, I was thousands of miles away, but I could save her. I could help my sister. I could help her like Marlene had helped me.\n\nIt was quiet, and when Lizzy spoke again, her voice was strangely calm.\n\n“She says that she watched you every single day in every single room. She says that you think you got away, but you didn’t. She says she’ll see you soon.”",

        "text": "The thing about carnivals is the sights and sounds of all things fun! We all had that one carnival we called our favorite and the foods that come with them. But one thing is for sure, when they become abandoned and left for rot, they become a searchers paradise of the unknown thrills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZak, Ryan, Derek and Mike made a pact with each other that if we were going to something fun, we'd always do it together, whether it's exploring old abandoned places or going on a fun trip! There was always a reason for doing these adventures, not knowing what they would be getting into!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing of an old abandoned carnival in the woods near their town from one of their other friends, they decided to go find it over the weekend! After they all got back home from school, they started texting each other to figure a way to get in the woods without their parents knowing. They quickly devised the plan, but little did they know, their lives were about to end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat Friday evening, they met up at the open field next to the woods on the outskirts of town. They made their move right after sundown, making sure no one saw them! After two hours of grueling hiking, they gazed upon the target they were after!!\n\n\"ClearWater Carnival\" is what the sign said nearest to the old run down ticket booth\n\n\"Lets go in and explore!\" said Derek, flashlight in hand!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I.........................I dont know about this guys. It fells off!\" said Zak, shaking and trying to get a better look.\n\nThey all decided to go in and check out the place, and right as they got inside, all of them felt an ominous feeling! The whole place lit up like it hadn't missed a day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Dude, lets get out of here!\" Said Mike, but no one listened! \n\nThey were all in shock at this and no one knew of the danger that was in front of them! Thats when they saw the sights!\n\nBLOODY BODIES! Bodies strewn everywhere! Used as prizes in games, child bodies strewn like puppets and bodies used as seats on most of the rides! \n\nThe boys ran but didnt get far!\n\n\"WHERES THE EXIT!\" said Zak, visibly freaked out!\n\n\"IDK, just run and search, we'll find it!\" said Ryan\n\nThey heard a BIG crash behind them, and saw the clown! He was drenched in blood, and carried a large axe! He gazed at the four boys, smiled the biggest smile they'd ever seen, then came charging after them!\n\n\"RUN, GO GO GO GO!!\" They all yelled, and they didn't make it very far! The clown was too fast\n\nHe hit Zak with one swing and killed him instantly! The other boys tried to fight back but no luck! The clown got the best of them too!\n\nI still remember the newspaper stories the next day of the four boys that went missing! The next day at school, I overheard one of the seniors touting that he had done the bloodiest scam ever. I never said anything, and rightfully so, because I learned a few days later that the same senior was arrested for trespassing at Kyle's house!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat goes to show you, never trust your friends, no matter who they are!",

        "text": "I sat there at the dead of night, lying on my bed, not even bothering to pick up the litter of clothes that are spread across the floor. I was wide awake while the deafening silence grew louder and louder, so much so that all I can hear is nothing. The pile of clothes seemed to multiply the more I look at them, the dirty stains of ketchup on one of the clothes makes it look like blood in the moonlight, it makes me feel uneasy but I know better that it’s just a piece of spilled condiment. There was no light in the room, the only light source I have are the moon and my computer, making the atmosphere more-gloomy than it should’ve been. I lie on my bed thinking about the choices I have decided and if they are the best or worst choices to make. The night did not seem to end no matter how long I waited, seconds turned into minutes, minutes turned into hours, all I can do now is distract myself with games, but that seems impossible in my current state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of boredom I got up from my bed and went for a night stroll. The cold breeze instantly hit my skin right as I went outside. The empty streets felt so peaceful, the windy roads, the breeze on the trees, the cold atmosphere, all that and the lack of people is more comforting than I thought, I might've even fell asleep outside on the cold hard pavement, but what was I thinking, I’ll catch a cold and a fever is not worth it for a little bit of comfort. As I walk on the empty street, passing by dark alley ways, stray cats, bus stops, closed shops, and street lamps, I sometimes see something on the corner of my eyes, something dark with bright white eyes, its face oozing with black substances, and its eyes glow bright in the dark but doesn’t emit any form of light. Every time I see that “thing” I thought to myself that it’s just my paralysis demon or just my tired brain making me see things, but deep inside I knew that that “thing” isn’t just in my head. I continued walking seeing that “thing” from time to time, every time I see it makes my body shake, my throat dry, and my heart beating faster and faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a long walk I finally found a café that is open 24 hours, I felt a sigh of relief exit my lungs and out my mouth while I made my way to an empty sit nearest to the window. The weird thing is, I have gotten used to that “thing” that has been following me for an hour, I’m still not sure why I got used to it that fast let alone getting used to it in general, there is just that lingering feeling that is strangely familiar whenever I see it. I ordered a small cup of cappuccino, probably not the best thing to drink in the middle of the night when you are a person that can’t sleep at all but what can I say, I loved coffee ever since I was young. The waitress gave me what I ordered in a small tray with some packets and a tiny spoon. I took a small sip on the coffee, it tasted bitter, sweet and very hot while it hit my tongue, as I swallowed, I felt the heat flow through all around my body, that is the greatest feeling after a long night of walking in the cold streets. As I looked out the window, I saw it, that “thing” looking through my soul. Now that I can see it more clearly without being scared, I just now only noticed it’s smile, that horrifying smile, it is as white as its eyes but it has no teeth only a white curve across its face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left the café after finishing my cup of coffee, as I was leaving it started to rain. The little droplets of the rain began to hit my not-so-protected head, I always love hearing the pitter patter of the rain while I walk drenched in water or not. As I walked on the streets, the rain began to drop more rapidly and the wind became stronger, I didn’t bring my jacket when I went outside so I’m just walking in the brewing storm without a little bit of protection. The peaceful sound from the soft rain suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was the rush of water hitting the ground like a person speaking gibberish. Lighting struck suddenly I felt the ground rumble for a bit and a flash of light before it happened, I hear thunder rumble every time lighting struck from cloud to cloud. I ran as fast as I could from the rain stopping under any bus stops I could see to take a short brake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally reached my house, I went to take a bath first to avoid getting sick, after that I picked up all my dirty and wet clothes and put all of them in small hamper, waited till my hair dried up and then went to bed. Like before, I couldn’t sleep but it was different this time, that “thing” it is now inside my house and it is staring right at me with its bright soulless eyes. I couldn’t care less because I wanted to sleep, I stayed awake long enough and I needed to sleep. I faced the other side of the bed where the window is, safe to say that the “thing” is not outside the window but it is right behind me still staring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been staring at me for a while now growing closer, as it grew closer, I could even smell it, it stinks like a rotting corpse it also smelled like sewer water, not like that will make me feel better. It made me anxious all over again, the thing grew closer and closer its rancid smell becoming stronger and stronger, smellier and smellier, becoming more unbearable. I didn’t even know if I was awake or not, all I knew is that I wanted this nightmare to end as soon as possible.",

        "text": "10:28: we left the school this morning at 6:30, we are suppose to drive to a town that about 50 minutes drive from our city but after 25 minutes we were in traffic. why there is traffic so early in the morning? i don’t know. we are still in traffic and something fell weird so i came to here, I’ll update if something happens.\n\n11:48: we are still in traffic and it doesn’t look like we are moving soon. i tried texting my mom to let her know we didn’t arrived but the message isn’t going through, I’ll try again later again.\n\n12:13: I’m not the only one that can’t seem to text to my parents, other kids complain that their phone isn’t working.\n\n13:28: we are still in traffic. some kids start to have panic attacks and some just laughing, my teacher Ms. Louise, tried calling the school many times but nobody answered. I’m starting to think that something bad is going to happen.\n\n14:34: the town doesn’t exist. Brian, a boy from my class tried looking up the town name and nothing came out of it. i didn’t believed him but then i tried looking up for that and there is nothing. fucking nothing. where the hell are we going? Ms. Louise said that she is trying to find out what going on and that probably that just misunderstanding but i don’t believe that. I’ll update later if we found something.\n\n15:56: we left traffic finally.\n\n16:25: nothing is working. before just to some kids texts and phone calls didn’t work, but now everything doesn’t work for everyone. we are right now just keep going and hopefully we would find some place to stay and find help.\n\n16:53: i just noticed that there isn’t other vehicles on the road and i don’t think I’m not the only one. some girls and boys from my class started to scream at Ms. Louise that they want to go home. i hope we are going home soon.\n\n17:34: i have no internet but for some reason i can write here. we are still on the road and we are starting to be hungry, until now we ate snacks and drank some water that luckily we were allowed to take on the bus, but now we ran out of that either. i hope we are going to get out of here soon.\n\n18:47: we are still doesn’t stopping. someone asked why we don’t talk to the driver, well because there isn’t one. yup, i don’t know when or how we didn’t noticed before but half hour ago Ms. Louise noticed that the man that was supposed to drive us is not there. she swears that she saw him and talked to him but now he is gone. i think she is losing her mind.\n\n19:29: we are hungry, tired, and need to go to the toilet. at the moment we pee in empty bottles. it’s disgusting but that’s what we have for now. as to the bus it’s still didn’t stop. even without a driver it’s still going and there’s is still no car on the road. if this isn’t a cruel prank then i think we’re losing our fucking minds.\n\n19:54: “do you think they are looking for us?” Amanda a girl from my class asked. we all said that yes ofc they are, but deep down we don’t think. as far everything that happened they think we made there or that actually we did made it, just not the real us, because by this point i wouldn’t be surprised if someone replaces us.\n\n20:35: we saw another car. we banged on the window and screamed for their attention but nothing. no one pulled over or stopped. and soon enough they took off. but now we have some hope that in some time someone will notice us.\n\n22:17: i went to sleep at around 9 and woke up 20 minutes ago to the sound of screaming. Miguel and Ross two boys from my class fight. this two idiots always had some rivalry but now of all times they took it out. the scream came from Alice another girl from my class who they accidentally hit in the face. Alice now have a black eye and crying in pain. that still didn’t stoped them so other boys separated them. we got to get out of here or we’re going to kill each other.\n\n23:16: Alice lost it. she tried to break the window, ofc that didn’t work and she is now screaming in pain. she probably broke her hand or something. i can’t hear her screams anymore. and that birch Ms. Louise just sitting on the side and doing nothing.\n\n00:34: finally there is silence. everyone is a sleep or tired. i think I’m going back to sleep and hopefully who’d wake up and this all be a dream.\n\n02:57: i just woke up and the bus isn’t moving anymore. we are standing in place. i don’t know if i should wake up someone or to try to escape from this hell. i can’t risk that chance. \n\n03:23: i wake up Ms. Louise and told her what’s happening. she told me she would try open the door and to stay quiet. she is now trying to open the door.\n\n03:27: she did it. she opened the doors. we are free.\n\n03:32: we left. only me and Ms. Louise, we can’t risk that those idiots would ruin something. we are going to find some town or a any place with people and come back to help them.\n\n08:45: sorry i didn’t update you all but a lot happened in the last 5 hours. after we left we walked for an hour until we found some town and went to there and knocked on some doors until someone opened their door. we called the police and they came after 10 minutes, they took us to questionings and they called my parents and Ms. Louise husband, at the meanwhile they started to look for the bus but still didn’t found anything. my parents would be here soon so I’ll update you then.\n\n13:36: so i have new information to you. there was never a trip. yup. we got an email from the school the night before about this trip but apparently they didn’t send that. the police are working right now on finding the sender of the email. also they still didn’t found the bus, and honestly i don’t think they will. the parents did looked for us so that’s something at least. as for now that it, i don’t think that i can update about this in the future but I’ll try my best. the one thing i do know for sure is that this person or this thing wanted us dead. I’m just glad i got out of there before they found the body of the real Ms. Louise.",

        "text": "I have been working as a dentist receptionist \n for 2 years now and it's been quite the ride.\n When I first started here I kept to myself I don't make friends easily so that left the outcome of me being alone at work almost every lunch break since I started here. The building where I work at is very crowded it's surrounded by a few shops that forms a U shape , a apartment complex with a Honchos take away resturant to the side and last but not least a car shop at the back with a alleyway filled with sewage water and oil, so not many wind or sun can come through windows from the back to the front leaving the work environment eerily cold even on summer days. I've noticed odd  things happening whenever I am alone at first I thought it might be my imagination or stress, but the more I spend time alone here the more I realized it was infact not my imagination running wild. \n\nWhen my coworkers go out to get lunch I stay behind catching up on some work or I practice my drawings. At first there were only noises like footsteps and doors opening and closing  do note that all the doors are locked except for the staff bathroom, the surgery room and the sterilization room  when I went to back to investigate I come across locked doors and not a person insight so my only plan of action was to ignore it and I did a pretty decent job until now. I had asked my coworker about the strange noices and she said that yes it does happen all the people that used to work here has mentioned it before and it only happened when you are alone so yet again the only answer was to ignore whatever it was.\n\n However things had gotten alot weirder I live in south africa and we have something called loadshedding it is a term used where our power supply company decides that it's time to switch off our power to save electricity but it causes more harm then good on that particular day we had just gotten our loadshedding and like I said there's no window's in the back except for the surgery and the bathroom, but with the buildings surrounding us and the alleyway behind it makes it kinda impossible for us to open the window in  the surgery without getting a strong smell that makes us want to puke our guts out so we close it for our own sanity leaving only the bathroom window open.\n\nI had too much water to drink so I had to go to the bathroom I told my coworker to watch the front for me incase we get a patient or the phone rings. As I got to the bathroom closing the door something tried pushing it open with force at first I thought it was my coworker playing a prank cause they know I am afraid of the dark, but when I glanced through the opening I saw no one but endless darkness, my heart started beathing faster and I received chills all over my body the first thing I did was yell out \" Not today buddy not today\" and pushed the door shut locking it as I did so.\n\n I did my buisness while I was still in shock waited a few minutes before darting out to get myself where light is, I told my coworker what happened and she replied it might be the wind cause it was windy outside however the wind wouldn't push open the door from the opposite side where there's no wind nor windows and like I said before we don't get much wind or light back there and the question that lingers in my head incase it was just the \"wind\" why didn't it happen before ? cause we do get strong winds like this but it never made me fight with a door to close it. \n\nToday was the last straw hence why I am writing this to tell someone about it without them thinking I am crazy. My coworkers had just left leaving me on my own to do some work I couldn't do before because of  loadshedding. My desk is quite a bit on the tall side and with me being short I cannot see over it when I sit down and people don't see me unless I stand up. So while I was busy with work the front door opened and closed thinking it might be a patient I looked up  seeing no-one I shook my head and continued what I was doing when it happened again.\n\n \"alright that might be the wind\" I thought ignoring it for the second time that's when things took a turn the phone rang and I answered it only hearing heaving breathing fron the other line I wanted to disconnect it. Just as I was I about to disconnect it the door opened stayed open for a good 10 seconds then it shutted closed with so much force that the whole front door rattled startled by both the phone call and the door I stood up and that's when a loud scream from the phone made it's way through the building I dropped the phone on the desk and fell to my knees holding my hands against my ears it felt like it was about to explode. when the screaming noices stopped I slowly pulled myself up feeling dizzy and disoriented I glanced at the mirror above the desk I had blood dripping from my ears the call disconnected people walking outside like normal they didn't hear what I just heard I closed my eyes for a split second allowing myself to drift into darkness...\n\n I am currently at home still shaken by the experience I just got off the phone with my boss I had to take a few days off I think the stress of the past few days has gotten to me...",

        "text": "“I swear to you, man! It’s an honest-to-God ghost town, just sitting out there!”\n\nThat was the line that hooked us. We had been standing around the pool table in our local bar, playing a few games and downing beers to celebrate the end of the week when the loud voice of Gerald Wright, a local hunter, filtered over to us, amplified by the sudden web of silence that comes between songs playing over the jukebox. Immediately, I looked up from the shot I’d been about to take to stare over my shoulder. He was sitting on one of the stools of the bar, talking to another hunter I didn’t know the name of, waving his arms around, a glass of beer precariously sloshing around in one hand.\n\n“I was out tracking a stellar four point buck through the woods, and I look down the hill to my left, and what do I see sitting in the valley? A damn ghost town, just sitting silent as a tomb with the afternoon sunlight glinting off the roofs and windows! I’m telling you, Mick”, he poked his friend in the chest, “I’ve been hunting up there twenty years, and I’ve *never* come across that place. I must’ve been blind to miss it!” He ran a hand over his face, pressing his fingers into his eyes as if to prove his point. I exchanged a look with Carlos across the table, raising an eyebrow and jerking my head behind me. I could see a look of curiosity etched onto his face in the bright white light of the lights over the pool table. It was one echoed in the third member of our group, Aaron. I held up one finger and set the cue down on the table, turning around and walking to the bar as the silence was broken by a country song coming on the speakers.\n\nI held up a hand to signal to the bartender. “Hey, Shelley, can I get one more Budweiser, please?” I called as she turned her head to me. She nodded, and I turned to the two men beside me. “Hey, Gerry, did I just hear you say something about a ghost town?” I asked nonchalantly. The man turned around to regard me with a look of confused irritation, but it melted away when he recognized me. “Oh, how ya doin’, Terry?”, he said, reaching out a meaty hand to shake mine, “Yeah, I was up hunting in the Lincoln Hills, going after what would’ve made an amazing pair of antlers to mount over my fireplace, and there’s, nearest as I can tell, an abandoned, empty ghost town sitting in a valley below me” He scrunched up his brow and shook his head. “Damndest thing, though. The place didn’t look that old. I never went down there, but. It looked, *new*” He shrugged his shoulders, and as my beer was placed on the bar in front of me, I asked one more question as I tossed a crumpled ten on the bar. \n\n“Was this near one of the logging roads?” He nodded. “Yeah, I could see the McKinley logging road off to the right, actually!” he said, then turned to his friend. “Shoot, we should go up there sometime while hunting, Mickey, boy!” Seeing my exit, I picked up my beer, slapped Gerald on the shoulder and bid him goodnight, then rejoined my friends. “You hear that?” I asked the two of them as I leaned against the pool table and took a swig of my beer. They both nodded. “Hell, yeah, man” Carlos said, leaning up next to me. Aaron leaned on his pool cue. “What’re you thinking, bro?” he asked. They both stared at me. “I’m thinking….”, I began, “I’m thinking we’ve got about five hours of daylight left before dark-“, I glanced at my wristwatch, “-actually, five and a half hours. Why don’t we take a trip up there and check this place out for ourselves? Do a little bit of urban exploring?” They exchanged a look between them, then shrugged. “Beats staying around here all night” Aaron said. “Besides, imagine the views we might get on YouTube for exploring a possibly undiscovered ghost town!” Carlos added. The guy had a small, but dedicated channel on YouTube where he showed off abandoned towns, mines and other places, garnering a few thousand subscribers.\n\n“Wait a minute, though”, Aaron interjected, “Gerry said it was up near McKinley road. There is absolutely no freaking *way* my car is going to make it up there. Neither will Carlos’ Explorer. Those ruts will tear ‘em both apart” I tilted my head at him, then smiled and rolled my eyes. “Did you forget I’ve got my K5 back at my place? That thing will eat up those ruts and dips and make it there and back perfectly fine!” They exchanged another look, then both split into grins. “Then what’re we still doing here?!” Carlos exclaimed, downing the last of his beer and throwing the bottle into a garbage bin. “Let’s go!” And with that declaration, we filed out of the bar into Carlos’ Explorer, and drove to my house. Sitting in the driveway was my pride and joy: An almost pristine Chevy K5 Blazer. We all piled into the truck, and after making sure we had all the equipment we might possibly need, drove through town and onto the logging roads.\n\nMany of them hadn’t been used in decades; the lack of maintenance on the roads had caused the dirt roads to become pockmarked with ruts and dips, making it look like the acne filled face of a teenager. Trees stretched over the road, some interlocking with each other like wooden fingers, and would occasionally scrape against the roof of the truck with a sickening sound as we passed through thick portions. Very quickly, much of the late afternoon sun became blocked by the thick foliage, leaving much of our drive in shadows. As we drove, I pushed a CD into the player, filling the cabin with the voice of Brad Paisley. I navigated around the dips and dents, occasionally slowing crawling through them and deep puddles where the road had become partially flooded by the previous night’s rain.\n\nAaron sat in the passenger seat, a yellowed, old as hell map detailing the logging roads in his lap. I’d bought it from a garage sale to help find my way around the backwoods when I went off roading. “Okay, if Gerry was right, it should be about two miles ahead of us. And if he saw it in a valley”, he pointed to a trough detailed by the map, “The only place I can think it would be, would be here, in Barrett Valley” Carlos poked his head between us to look down at the map himself. “You ever even hear about an abandoned town out here before?” he asked, the question addressed to both of us. We both shook our heads. For the next ten minutes, the music was the only thing heard besides the rumble of the truck’s engine and the scrape of the tree branches. Then it was broken by Carlos, pointing his finger past us and out the windshield.\n\n“Look!” he said. It would’ve been so easy to miss, being almost completely overgrown, but he *had* spotted something. It was an offshoot road, clearly not been used in even longer than the road we were on. “Good eye!” Aaron cried, turning around and slapping him high five. I stared at the road for a moment, though. I tilted my head sideways. There was…a strange feeling I was getting from looking at it. I couldn’t place it exactly, but it just felt…*unnatural*. Shaking it off, I turned off the radio, then reached down and shifted the four wheel drive into low gear. “Well, here we go, guys” I said, then turned slowly onto it. I will forever kick myself in the ass for not paying attention to that feeling. I know now it was an instinctive warning, one I failed to heed. \n\nIt became, if possible, even more slow going. I could barely see the edges of the road, as the bushes had already begun to regrow in the middle of it, a sign that nature had long since begun to reclaim this for itself. I turned on the truck’s headlights, along with the roof mounted lights to help see where I was going. For about ten minutes, that’s all that we saw: unending trees and bushes pressing in on us as though they were trying to trap us in place. Then, they began to space out, and the road became visible again. What was strange, though, was that, two minutes later, it changed from dirt, to tarmac. I remember actually feeling so stupified that I brought the truck to a stop for a minute, staring at the black road with yellow lines down the middle, before snapping myself out of my surprise, shifting back into two wheel drive and continuing.\n\nA minute later, and we rounded the last corner. And we finally saw it. I brought the truck to a stop before a bridge leading into town, and all three of us leaned forward. Carlos whistled. “Wow. That….that’s something I didn’t expect to see” he breathed. I had to agree with him. I hadn’t asked Gerald for details, but, I never in a million years would’ve thought in my head of this. The place was not even close to small. It took up the entire length and width of the entire valley, and stretching out before us were rows upon rows of streets, houses sitting behind long overgrown lawns that looked like small jungles. Off to the left, was what had to be downtown; at least four or five blocks were taken up by commercial buildings, along with what looked like a cinema and a community center. At the far end of the town, we could see the faded white church spire rising above everything else.\n\n“Holy…shit” Aaron mumbled. We all turned to look at each other, then laughed softly. “We just hit the jackpot!” Carlos exclaimed, reaching into his bag and pulling out his camcorder, beginning to film through the windshield. “You’re not kidding” I added, then looked to my right. “Look” I said, pointing. Set right after the bridge was a medium sized metal sign. In white letters that stood out from the blue background, it proclaimed: WELCOME TO MCKAMEY, POPULATION, 12,463. “Dude”, Aaron said as Carlos leaned forward to zoom in on the sign, “not even *our* town has a population of twelve thousand people” He looked around. “And this place looks too new to be from any more than thirty years ago” He was right; The design of the houses and the commercial buildings looked far newer than any abandoned town I’d stumbled across. “So, why do you think it’s empty, and we never heard about it before?” I asked, turning around in my seat to look at Carlos. He shrugged, running his free hand through his short brown hair. “Maybe it was a planned expansion of the area that never came to be. Maybe it was meant to be a new development, but the company or people financing it ran out of money, and had to abandon it”\n\nThe idea somewhat soothed the eerie feeling that gazing over the town had filled me with. *Carlos is right, he has to be. Just some rich idiot’s pet project that bankrupted him*. Repeating that thought in my mind, I slowly pressed on the gas, and we crossed over the bridge, which rattled slightly, into town. Now, if you, during the pandemic, ever got to see how eerie it looked, to see what should have been a populated area completely deserted, take that, and amplify it ten times, and you’ll have an idea of how it felt to drive through McKamey. The noise of the truck’s engine and exhaust bounced and echoed off the buildings and surrounding hills back at us through the open windows we’d lowered to let the cool air inside, and for Carlos to film. We criss-crossed through some of the residential streets first, looking to see if we could see any abandoned cars parked in the driveways or anything of the sort. But we never saw any. All we saw were the houses, all which seemed to have a relatively modern design to them, but aged by the elements, paint ripped off the sides and gutters hanging precariously off the roofs. More than a few had their windows broken; I noticed that some were broken inwards instead of out, as I saw no broken glass among the tall grass and weed infested front yards.\n\nThen we stopped at the church. Its white paint was fading as well, and the front doors stood wide open. We could see inside, where, visible in the slight gloom, many of the pews had been upturned. The pulpit had been destroyed, *Likely by vandals*, I thought, and the statue of Jesus crucified on the cross was barely visible behind its remains, having been knocked to the floor. I shifted my eyes from the mess inside, to the announcement sign at the end of the walkway leading up to it. The glass had fogged up with many years of disuse, but I could just barely make out the white letters which had been set up behind it. SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THE PESTILENCE! GOD IS HERE TO OFFER YOU SALVATION! I couldn’t understand why, but I unwillingly shuddered reading it, a chill shooting up my back. The guys had noticed it as well. “What the hell did they mean by, the pestilence?” Carlos asked, zooming in on the sign. “Fuck if I know” I said, for some reason unwilling to look back into the church. The shuddering feeling came over me again; to use the old phrase, it felt as though someone had just walked over my own grave.\n\nAaron looked at his phone. “Well, we have about two hours of daylight remaining. You wanna go check out the downtown area?” I let out a deep breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding, then nodded. “Yeah, why don’t we go check that out, then get back to town. I honestly don’t want to drive those logging roads after dark” They accepted my answer and turned away, but I knew I’d been full of shit. It had nothing to do with the logging roads; it was *here* that I didn’t want to be when the sun went down. I put the truck in drive, and with just a little too much of a push on the gas, pulled away from the curb. We drove back down the main boulevard towards the downtown area. About five minutes later, we had pulled into a faded parking space in the downtown square. Dirty windows concealed the surrounding building’s interiors, but the signs above, as broken and dirty as many were, still showed what they had been. Just from our space, we saw a laundromat, a library, the town newspaper building, what looked like a video rental store, a repair garage, a convenience store, and at the end of the square, the community center.\n\n“Hold on” I said, shutting the truck off and pulling the key from the ignition. Using another key on the ring, I unlocked the center console, and opening it, pulled a small black case from it. I opened it, revealing a silver handgun. “Well, *damn*!” Aaron exclaimed. I snorted, then held it up as I picked up two magazines from the box as well. “Beretta 92FS INOX. Don’t leave home without it” I pulled a holster from under the driver’s seat and, with a little wiggling, hooked it onto my thigh. I slapped a magazine into the gun, then clipped it into the holster, stuffing the extra one into my shirt pocket. “Not taking any chances, are you?” Carlos asked, lowering his camera. I shook my head. “Not around here where there’s a large wolf population. Last thing I need is to explore this place and get ambushed by a wolf or cougar which took up residence somewhere” Kicking open my door, I hopped out and made my way to the back of the truck as the others hopped out. I opened the tailgate and reached inside, pulling out another case, inside which revealed a hunting rifle, along with three high powered flashlights.\n\nI handed Aaron the rifle, along with some extra ammo, then passed out the flashlights. “Just in case” I said to Carlos, who looked perplexed at the firearms. *The guy’s only lived out here five years, he doesn’t know why it’s a good idea to carry out here all the time. Especially after the Connors incident*. I winced as I recalled the wolf attack on the now dead hiker. “So, where do you want to start?”, I asked, glancing at my watch, “We’ve got about an hour or so to check this out, if we want to get back before nightfall” The two of them looked around, Carlos already holding up his camera. “Well, I was thinking of starting with the library, then making my way to the newspaper building. Could help to find out when this place was abandoned from there, if this place ever even *had* residents” I scrunched up my mouth a bit; I loved libraries, but I spent enough time in one in a *living* town, let alone one long since deserted. I glanced around. “Okay, here’s what we’ll do, then. You two go check out the library and the newspaper office. Watch your backs and don’t get separated” I motioned down the other end of the square. “I’m gonna go check out the garage, and the video store” Carlos gave me a worried look. “How’re we gonna stay in touch, though, in case anything happens?”\n\nI reached back into the truck, before slamming the tailgate closed. I handed Carlos a radio; the second, I clipped onto my belt before turning it on. “That’s how” I said, before tapping it. “Keep it tuned to channel four, that’s what I’m on” They nodded, and after a final exchange of “Be Safe”, we parted ways. I watched them walk across the road and climb the steps to the massive wooden front doors of the library, then began walking down the middle of the road after they slipped inside. Now that I was alone, the town seemed to have an even more eerie feeling to it. *This place doesn’t feel like one that was built and then just abandoned*, I thought to myself as my boots crunched over dead leaves which had accumulated on the asphalt, listening to the wind whistle and my footfalls echo, *It almost feels more like it had been lived in first, and is now just…dead*. I couldn’t put my finger on why it felt that way; it just was, almost an intuition. As I headed for the garage, the wind whistled around me, and I felt a shudder go up my spine. I stopped, then turned and looked at the windows of what had to be apartments over the stores. They stood dark and unmoving, no shapes in them. I almost wished there had been figures in them. It would’ve been far less creepy.\n\nShaking my head, I turned back and walked a little faster until I reached the garage. Both bay doors were shut, and the windows on the top of them were too high to see through, so I headed for the cracked glass door that customers would enter. Flicking on my flashlight, I pulled on the handle. It opened after a moment of tugging, causing a bell hooked on the inside of it to ring. I stepped inside and looked around as it shut, the sound echoing in the stillness. Directly in front of me stood the main counter where the mechanic would greet customers; sitting atop it was the monitor for a computer, with a rack of part boxes and oil behind it. Shelves lined one side of the room with bottles and boxes that had their labels long since rotted or peeled away, as did posters on the wall. *Wait a minute…*I turned my flashlight back to the counter. I focused the beam on the computer monitor. *Uhhh…what?* I shook my head slightly, but, I wasn’t seeing things. It was a flat screen monitor, not one of the boxy units from the 80s, 90s, or even early 2000s. *That’s…that…how the hell did that get here?* I crossed the floor and vaulted over the counter, turning to look at it.\n\nIt was, indeed, a newer model flat screen monitor; the Dell logo still visible beneath the layer of dust covering it. I couldn’t see the tower, only the monitor and keyboard. Shaking my head, I turned away and stepped through the door leading to the repair bays. I shone the light around the dark, expansive room. The beam glinted off something metal in the far bay. It was a vehicle sitting up on the far lift. I crossed the room quickly, stepping over spilled oil and other fluids until I stood just below it. I felt an even larger sense of confusion and shock course through me as I stared up. *…What the actual fuck?* I wasn’t looking at an older car or truck. I was looking at a Cadillac Escalade. And not one of the older ones, either. It was one of the *brand new* Escalades, the generation that had only been out for two or three years now. *But…it looks much older than that*. The undercarriage was coated with what had to be years, if not decades of rust and corrosion, and the paint on the side was faded, as though it had sat outside in the beating sun for countless summers.\n\nFeeling a massive sense of unease sweep over me like a tsunami, I stepped around the back and aimed the light at the license plate on the back of the SUV. The sticker on the plate indicating what year it would expire was illegible; it had faded too much to read. Feeling like insects were crawling under my skin, I turned and quickly left the garage, banging open the door a little too hard and causing the bell to jangle loudly. The sound ricocheted off the buildings like a gunshot, and I froze for some reason, holding my breath. Another shiver went up my spine, and I looked around. But the streets remained empty. Reaching down, I pulled the radio from my belt and pressed the transmit button. “H-hey, guys?” I called, my voice shaking slightly. “There’s, um. There’s something really rather weird going on here” The radio crackled with static. “You’re telling me!” I heard Carlos’ voice filter through. “There’s what look like newer computers at the circulation desk for the library, and some of the books we found, neither of us had ever heard before in our lives!” I heard him laugh, still holding down the button. “This place is wild; I’ve gotten some great footage of it all!” I spoke into the radio, willing my voice to stay level. “That’s, uh, that’s great man. You guys ready to get out of here now?” \n\nThe answer I received was not the answer I wanted. “Just give us five more minutes, Terry! Please, we just entered the newspaper office, and this is our last stop” I wanted to tell him to take the newspaper offices and shove them up his ass, but, I couldn’t. He was my friend, and he sounded too excited. *Just give them five, and then you can be gone*. I thumbed the radio. “Alright, but just five, okay?”\n\n“Copy that” I heard Carlos say. But, behind that, I heard something else. I heard what must’ve been Aaron coughing heavily. “Hey, Aaron alright?” I asked. “Yeah, he’s fine, we must have kicked up something from the library floor!” he said, and then clicked off the radio. *Well, that’s great*, I thought, sighing and looking around again. A cold gust of wind hit me, and I pulled up my collar to shield myself. *I hate how this place feels so fucking….dead*. Not wanting to remain out in the open, I strode quickly back across the square to the video store. *Wanted to see in here, anyways*. Looking up, I could barely make out the name. “Nostalgia Video” Pulling open the dirt smeared door, I stepped inside and shone my light around. There was a circular desk at the front of the store, with aisles stretching out behind it. I began to walk towards it, when the light reflected off something stuck on the inside of the windows. I turned and saw it’d reflected off dust and dirt covered movie posters. “Hmm” *Maybe see what movies they were advertising last*. Trying to take my mind off the sense of uneasiness slowly being replaced with a, for the life of me, I couldn’t understand why, existential dread, I crossed the room and, using the sleeve of my coat, wiped away enough so it could be read. \n\nStepping back, I stopped, trying to process what I was looking at. I stared in confusion. *The Nun 2….?* I blinked rapidly, biting my lower lip. I am a huge movie buff, and I *knew* for a fact that there was no movie which had come out in the last few decades called that. There *was* a movie called *The Nun*, which had come out in 2018, and a sequel coming out later this year, but…*no, there’s no…this makes no fucking sense!* I looked down at the bottom of the poster at the smaller lettering. “20th anniversary re-release. Rent it now on Blu-Ray and Virtual Video Disc” My jaw dropped open. “What…the actual…FUCK, is going on?” I whispered. *…Okay, Ter, time to get the fuck out of here. NOW!* Turning and feeling as though I’d just stepped off a roller coaster, I stumbled out of the store and into the fading light. I put my hand to my head and took in deep breaths, trying to steady myself.\n\nThat’s when the door to the newspaper office across the street burst open. I snapped up, yanking the pistol out of its holster on instinct. But I stopped when I saw Aaron and Carlos dashing down the steps. The looks on their faces made whatever I was about to say die in my throat. Both of them had pale, terrified expressions on their faces, as though they’d just seen a monster or a murder. Carlos had something clenched in one hand. “Guys, what the fu-“ I began, but they tore past me, both screaming for me to follow them. Not knowing what else to do, I sprinted to catch up to them as they ran towards the community center. They reached the hulking building and slammed into each other as they tore for the handle of the fading yellow doors. “Move, let me open it!” I heard Aaron shout. “YOU get the fuck out of the way!” Carlos screamed back at him. I was about to step in and pull them both back, when one of them, I’m not sure which, managed to tear the right door open. I reached around them and pulled the left door back, staring inside. And…*Jesus, Mary and Joseph …*do I wish I hadn’t.\n\nThe inside of the community center was one giant room, a bubble glass roof which had long since broken providing light inside. Broken glass and leaves littered the floor underneath it, and tables had been shoved all to one side of the room. It was drenched in gloom. But not gloomy enough to hide what lay inside, and our flashlight beams made sure to leave no doubt. The *entire* town’s population looked to be here. They were scattered across the floor, with many in the center, huddling around each other. As messed up as it was, I almost wish they’d been rotting corpses. It would’ve shown they hadn’t been dead long. But they weren’t. They were all skeletons. I could see the bones of families huddling together with tattered, torn clothes on, parents holding their children. What had to be couples embraced each other, while still others curled up alone, hugging their own knees. The worst ones, were the few who lay slumped against the walls, a pistol in their hands, and what appeared to be a bullet hole in the back of their skulls.\n\nI began shaking, feeling as though someone were pouring ice water down my back nonstop. Behind them was a white banner, one which read in black letters “Emergency Shelter”. I looked from the horrifying sight to Carlos, my eyes wide and my breath coming in ragged gasps, trying to find something, I don’t know what, in his gaze. He looked at me, his eyes as wide as mine, and wordlessly handed me what he’d been holding. As I stared at it, I felt my jaw drop open, and the flashlight I’d been holding fell from my hand, smashing and breaking on the pavement.\n\nFor a moment longer, we all just looked at each other, the only sound heard being the ghostly whistle of the wind. And then we ran. We all dashed across the square, the sound of our feet echoing in the deathly stillness, reaching the truck and leapt inside. Jamming the key into the ignition, I slammed on the gas. Almost flipping the truck from how sharply I turned the wheel, I swerved onto the road leading out of town, sending it airborne over the bridge before crashing back down in a shower of sparks. “My camera!” Carlos cried suddenly, looking behind him. But there was no fucking *way* I was going back for it. I kept my foot down, smashing through the bushes and trees until we came to the logging road, then turned onto it, and not caring about my truck at all, flew down it back to town.\n\nAs soon as we made it back, I immediately drove to the police station. I must’ve looked like an absolute madman bursting through the doors, but luckily, the sheriff knew me, and didn’t pull his gun on me. Stammering, almost blubbering, I managed to get out what I could. I knew I sounded absolutely insane, but…I needed to tell them. I *had* to. I could tell they didn’t believe a word I said, but even still, they still sent a few deputies up into the hills with their off road cruiser to investigate. When they came back, they shrugged their shoulders at me. “There’s nothing up there, Terry”, one told me, “Nothing but an empty valley”\n\nI wanted to press, but. I let it go. They’d just assumed we’d had one too many drinks, maybe even eaten some shrooms and ended up seeing things. In the back of my mind, I knew they’d never find anything, even though I’d wanted them to. There was a reason for it. The object Carlos had handed me, which I’d stupidly dropped as I ran? It’d been a yellowed newspaper. The headline read: NATIONAL DEATH TOLL RISES TO 190 MILLION AS PRESIDENT DECLARES MARTIAL LAW! That wasn’t what cut through me like a knife, making me feel as though all I knew and believed about reality was crashing down around me. It was the date at the top of the paper. \n\nJuly 22nd, 2047. \n\nThat was over a year ago. When they’d come back and told us they found nothing, the three of us made a pact, vowing to never speak again about what we’d seen. We all felt it’d be better that way. So, why, after all this time, am I breaking it? Why am I posting my experience here and telling all of you when I’ve spent months trying to drown myself in booze in an attempt to forget? I guess as a warning, for two reasons. The first being, thanks to this site, I just recently learned about the concept of a time slip. An overlap of the past…or *future,* and the present. And second? Because last week, there was a town hall meeting. It was to introduce us residents to a wealthy land owner who has just moved here. I went, out of sheer curiosity. He spoke about how he’d purchased a large slice of former logging land to develop a new town, one to attract more people to our area. He even showed artists’ renditions of what he wanted it to look like. When I saw them, I felt myself begin to violently shake, as the existential dread I felt that day returned in spades. At the top of the concept art was the name he intended to choose for it.\n\nTake three fucking guesses what it was.",

        "text": "I’ve never minded working a night shift. Or at least, I’ve never minded working a night shift as a park ranger. Night shifts here are drastically different from most other night shifts. I’m naturally more of a night person, and there’s nothing better than being a night person and being able to be outdoors at night, especially in the desert. \n\nLike many things, nature truly comes alive at night. Forests do it, jungles do it, and the desert certainly does it. Unlike the other two, deserts not only come alive, but drastically change. It’s quite literally like a different terrain, as the scorching heat becomes cool. No matter how many times I’ve experienced it firsthand, it never ceases to be something like no other.\n\nThe night air was crisp, cool, and dry as I hopped in my car. As I headed down the road, I could hear a coyote sounding off out there somewhere in the distance. The sound never fails to give me chills, and I hope it never does. It’s one of those primal experiences that reminds you of the stunning power of nature. Better still is when you hear one coyote, and then you hear a different one responding to it. I love nature documentaries but experiencing that firsthand is in a league all its own. And the few times I’ve heard it, I cant help but wonder what they are saying to each other. Having worked as a ranger my entire professional life, I suspect I have an idea, but I will never know for sure. And that’s the beauty of nature. You can dedicate your whole life to it, and still find new things to discover.\n\nAlthough you do have to be extremely careful because rattlesnakes are very common around here. I can’t tell you how many I’ve stumbled across in my time. We do keep plenty of antivenom on hand, but I still have no desire to stumble into a nest of them. I’ve seen plenty of individual rattlesnakes over the years, but never a nest of them. Marco has, and he will never approach anything out here the same way again.\n\nI’d been assigned to check out an area with some other rangers. Things were typically quiet in the park out here, but that didn’t mean we didn’t get the occasional bit of the unusual. \n\nThe terrain was dotted with cactus plants, and I never failed to enjoy the sight of them, as the massive variety we had here was one of my favorite things to see, especially as the Sun sets. Some of the terrain out in this part of the state, especially at night, looks like something straight out of a movie. There’s nothing like building a fire with a saguaro cactus looking down on you from the canyon. And I was due to meet my fellow rangers at the main cactus attraction in the whole park, a feature I always enjoyed seeing. \n\nThe road dipped lower as I descended further into the park. As the road slanted down, there was a magnificent view of the cactus garden that was carefully maintained and went on for several acres. During the day, the cactus garden’s gate was wide open, and the path was open for anyone to leisurely stroll through. But even though it was currently nighttime, the gate had been unlocked. \n\nMy car bounced over the dusty roads, kicking up clouds of dust in its wake. Just ahead, I could see the other ranger vehicles all parked in front of the garden entrance. I guided my car right alongside the others before I got out and approached my colleagues. As I did, Jonathan gave me a wave. \n\n“Evening Peter,” Jonathan said. \n\n“Evening Jonathan,” I nodded in return before the other 6 rangers and I exchanged a brief greeting. They were all people I’d known and worked with for a while. The path to the cactus garden evened out as I had approached them, and now I was on an impeccably paved path that led inside. \n\n“Alright guys, here’s the deal. We’ve been seeing signs someone has been trespassing on park land. We’ve never actually seen the person, but we’ve seen footprints in odd places, and occasionally, we’ve seen things out of place.” \n\n“Understood. So why are we here?” Veronica asked. \n\n“Because we suspect here is where they may be hiding out.” \n\nThat was a good idea. During the day, the space under the complex would provide some cover from the intense desert heat. \n\n“So we just thought we’d do a quick search of the place.”\n\n“Sounds good to me.” Jonathan nodded. “Let’s do it.” \n\nI had only been in the cactus garden once before at night, but it was stunning. The lights in various colors helped illuminate the flowers and needles, giving the whole place a surreal vibe. My shoes lightly thudded on the impeccably tiled pathway as we all walked along, having split off in pairs from there. We don’t go off searching alone if it can be helped, so I was paired with Jen, who I’d always had a good rapport with. So it was no surprise the two of us made casual chit chat as we strolled along, flashlights out, and looked for any signs of trespassing. I asked about her two grown children, who were in college, and she asked about my parents, who were retired and living in New England. \n\nI was in the middle of telling her about the time I went out fishing with them on their boat when I turned the corner, and saw something. I wasn’t quite sure what it was at first, but then I realized it was a very faint opening in the wall behind a row of small cactus plants. Ironically, it was the darkness and evening light that made it visible. Because of the contrast it provided, I was able to see what looked like a cupboard or something inside.\n\n“Do you see that?” I asked Jen. \n\nShe nodded. “Sure do.” \n\nThen she stopped, held up her hand, and quietly gestured for our colleagues to come here. They did, and before I knew it, we were all looking at the opening in the wall. After Jonathan had radioed our superiors about what we’d stumbled upon, he gestured for us all to come closer. \n\n“Ok,” he whispered. “Veronica, Frank, and I will carefully approach, while the rest of you keep watch. Keep an eye out but stay put unless something happens.” \n\nWe murmured our agreement and the three of them approached the opening in the wall. I watched as they gently pulled on the section, so it opened further, and I heard the creaking and groaning of wood. Within moments, the section of the wall opened further, revealing that section was flimsily attached to the rest of the structure. \n\nThe passageway was just large enough to accommodate one person at a time if they crouched down like a crawl space, which is exactly what the rest of us did when they gave us the all clear to come inside. Inside there was the interior foundation of the building housing the cactus garden, but apart from that it was just a tunnel with empty rock walls, as the cactus garden was built into a side of the canyon. We all took our flashlights out after more radio calls back to our superiors. A quick check back at the ranger station revealed that part of the park was originally used as a mining camp, which was no surprise to anyone. But that was where the official records ended, so we had to investigate the old-fashioned way. \n\nThe tunnel didn’t have any tracks or other signs it had been regularly used by miners such as old equipment, so that didn’t give us a clue about what we’d find. But after a few minutes of following it, the tunnel ended and came to a dead end. Or so we thought, because hidden behind some dust and gravel, was a gap in the canyon wall, and we were all able to step through it. Within moments, we were standing in an open space that was enclosed by the canyon walls. It took a moment for the flashlights to properly illuminate enough for me to make out what I was looking at, but when I knew what this was, I had never been more excited in my life. \n\nThe buildings had long since ceased to function, but there was no mistaking this was a ghost town. It was small, and there weren’t that many buildings, but I’d been in plenty to recognize one when I saw it. The wooden foundations of buildings stood there silently, while the walls surrounding them had long since been reduced to their most basic layer of bricks. I wasn’t surprised, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t exhilarated. I’d grown up hearing about one ghost town legend or another, and who knows what story this place was apart of. Nor was I alone with my excitement, because all my colleagues started chatting excitedly amongst themselves, with me joining in. \n\n“Ok. Let’s split off in pairs again and see if we can find anything,” Veronica said. \n\nShe didn’t need to suggest it twice because we all couldn’t wait to explore. As we all went off to walk through the remnants of buildings, I had no idea what I’d find. There was no telling who, or what for that matter, could be lurking around. \n\nThe lack of natural light gave everything a slightly spooky feel. Because a flashlight, while essential, always seems to give everything a more unnerving mood. \n\nA brief double check with our colleagues back at the ranger station revealed that this place, whatever it was, had never been logged into any record before. Records of all abandoned towns in the area are kept pretty up to date, and there was no indication at all this was out here, so that meant this place was undiscovered, and we were the first people to set foot here in who knows how long. This naturally led to the question of what was this place, and why had it been abandoned? \n\nJen and I chatted happily about what this place might be while I cast my flashlight around for any of the telltale signs of relatively recent human inhabitants. Trash, footprints, and the smell of food were just a few of the most common ones. So far, there was no sign of any of that, as the area seemed to be extraordinarily clean. For a moment, I ceased to be a park ranger, and had become an archeologist, as I was breathing air, taking steps, and looking at things that hadn’t experienced human activity for what looked like ages. And I was this excited from just looking at the surface. Who knows what would be found when people started to comb this place more thoroughly? \n\nWe stepped over what was once a stone wall and found ourselves starring at what was left of some building. From it’s place in the center and the fact that the structure’s foundation seemed to be the largest, I suspected it was probably some sort of meeting place. \n\nVeronica and Jonathan had already gotten there, and the others were there right behind us. It didn’t take us long to figure out that no one had found anything, so we all carefully approached the last building. \n\nAlthough it looked just like all the others on the inside, this one made me feel like I was beginning to get a headache. From a look at my colleagues, I could tell they felt the same way, as they all grimaced unpleasantly as they looked around. There was nothing in here aside from something small near the wall facing the entrance. \n\nOur flashlights revealed it to be a statue, and a closer look showed that it was made of stone and carved to resemble what looked like a scorpion. \n\nThat was no surprise, because anyone who’s ever spent time out here knows to be very careful around scorpions. I’ve never been stung by one, but I know people who have, and they said it was beyond painful. And we’re in the age of antivenom. \n\nWe all stared at the statue for a moment before Veronica informed the ranger base what we’d found. After a moment, they told her, and the rest of us, to let it be, and a professional team experienced in handling artifacts would retrieve it in the morning. \n\nGood enough for us. So with that, we slowly walked back the way we came through the cactus garden. The fresh air felt amazing after being in that confined space, and I happily took in several deep breaths. Especially since the longer we were in there by the ghost town, the worst I felt. But now that we were out of there, I felt invigorated like I always did by the desert at night. \n\nIt didn’t take me long to say goodbye to the other rangers, and then it was the end of my shift. Then I left the park, picked up a sandwich, and headed home. Once there, I ate my sandwich with some chips and crashed on the couch. I must’ve dozed off because I woke up several hours later. But something was off. It took me a moment, but I realized that some sounds coming from outside had woken me up. \n\nI felt every muscle in my body tense up as I realized it was the sound of people outside. I lived in a single-story ranch house, so it wasn’t like I was in some apartment high in the sky where no one could break in. I listened more carefully than I’d ever listened to anything in my life, so I would have some clue as to what was going on. The voices were whispered, but I could make out at least three distinct people talking. There may have been more of them nearby. I had no idea what they were planning, but I was sure it wasn’t good. \n\nAll of this took place in the span of a few seconds. As quietly as I could, I got off the couch, grabbed my phone, and headed to my bedroom, where I kept several things I could defend myself with. As I crept as quietly as I could to my bedroom, I got through to the police, and I told them as quietly and clearly as I could what was going on. They told me to sit tight, and they were on the way. I thanked them, then tried to listen carefully to see if whoever was outside had heard me at all. Fortunately, they didn’t seem to. So all that was left was for me to listen carefully and wait. \n\nBut moments later, I heard an angry cry from outside, which was followed immediately by a loud crash. Then, several more different shouts joined the first one, which was then followed by several more. Fear had temporarily been joined by puzzlement and curiosity. I knew the sounds were sounds of agony and pain, but from what, I had no idea. My first thought was that someone had accidentally dropped their gun and it fired and hit the people outside, but aside from that I was clueless. \n\nThen all was silent, and I was left alone with my thoughts, which raced through my head. The quiet was both calming and unnerving, so I was on edge for what seemed like an eternity. I didn’t dare step out of my room until I saw the telltale lights from outside and the knock on my door announcing it was the police. I was greeted by two officers, while several more stood outside. \n\n“What happened here?” One of the officers, a gentleman with a thick white mustache asked. \n\nI told them briefly what I’d said them on the phone. \n\n“Yes, we know that. I mean what happened here?” He turned and pointed towards the side of my house where several hedges were. I followed them and saw three people in ski masks lying motionless on the ground. \n\n“I……I don’t know. After I called, I heard the sounds of yelling and screaming from outside. No idea why. I thought someone had accidentally shot themselves.” \n\nHe nodded, and took a step closer to the three masked strangers. But them he immediately jumped back, because in the artificial light from my garage, I could see several small shapes scuttling around by the hedges. Now I knew why there had been screaming. My unwanted visitors had stumbled upon several Arizona Bark Scorpions. I’d recognize them anywhere. \n\nThe cops did too, because they immediately called for an ambulance and informed them about what had happened. The medics didn’t mess around, but the intruders won’t be out of the hospital for a while because they had all been collectively stung dozens of times. It wasn’t pretty. \n\nThe strange thing is that I’ve seen that scorpion a million times, but never around my house. In fact, I’d never had a problem with any scorpion at home before. I asked my neighbors about it, and they never had the issue either. \n\nI eventually forgot about the incident and life went on. The professional team came and took the scorpion statue to a museum for further study, and a different team came in to fully catalog and document the ghost town. I wasn’t there when it happened, but it went off without anything odd happening. But sometimes, some of the park rangers have reported being off on a job, or being off the clock, and having an unusual encounter with a scorpion. Like Jen, who looked over and saw one on the floor of the backseat of her car, and inadvertently crashed her car because of it and later found out had that not happened, she would’ve been in a horrible accident just a few miles away. Personally, I’ve only seen a few scorpions since the incident at my house, but I swear, I could feel them studying me.",

My hands trembled as I unfolded the papers in front of me. It was a long e-mail that had been sent to me in April 1998.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDear Benjamin,\n\nI can only hope that this message reaches you in time. I know it will be hard for you to believe me, impossible even, but together with the evidence that I attached you should at least find it within yourself to consider it. It must be just recently that Julia kissed you for the first time and whispered those enchanted words in your ear. They’ll inspire you to follow her, to be part of something greater than yourself. And you’ll be happy together. There’s no doubt about it. For a long time, your life will be better than you ever thought possible. Please understand why, then, this message is the hardest thing I’ve ever written.\n\nDuring our final march through the nuclear wasteland of England, we found the ruins of the Leif Andersson Institute in what was once London. They had built a device there that allowed us, a small group of dissidents within the empire, to send a message back in time. I know such a sentence will be very difficult for you to take seriously, but I implore you to continue reading. The year, at the time of writing this, is 2047. We don’t have much time. For you, it’s only 1998 and time is on your side.\n\nLet me tell you what will happen to you if the timeline is allowed to continue on its natural course. There are only a few of us left… the few of us who still remember the early days. And I’m one of them, perhaps the one with the most insight into our history. I’ll tell you the story in past tense since that is how it happened from my perspective, even though for you it’s still nothing more than a dream of what’s to come.\n\nOnly a week after Julia kissed you, some of the targets were being given to Oliver’s cohort. They were mostly given pedophiles who had set up meetings with what they thought were twelve-year-old girls. It was a simple tactic that proved effective. Oliver and his friends showed up, wearing Roman theater masks that made them look terrifying even to the other cohorts, and attacked the unsuspecting victim with baseball bats that they had stolen from the gym at school and painted black. Oliver wasn’t ordered to kill, and to avoid it they were instructed to beat the victims in a very specific manner, with a specific number of blows to specific body parts, which made it look almost ritualistic. On some occasions in the beginning, you were ordered to observe these attacks from a safe distance just to make sure Oliver was following protocol, and you were happy to do so for the woman you loved even though you never had a taste for violence. Julia was too busy building what would become the Forum. It was an updated version of the Castrum but served as a web page aimed at the public. It bore the same red aesthetics as the Castrum but without the symbols of the legion and allowed the users to create their own profiles and add each other as friends. Julia insisted on forcing the users to register with their real names, abolishing the idea of privacy that had been a natural part of the internet thus far. She was happy to share her thoughts on this:\n\n“It’s simple. Information is going to be more valuable than oil in the future. It will be an asset, not only to satisfy the legion’s never-ending need for new targets but also for our financial needs. That’s why we need the users to share as much information about themselves as possible. It makes sense if you think about it. We’ll give the users the electronic bread and circuses that they crave, and all they need to offer us in return are their souls!”\n\nOliver’s cohort grew in numbers and a few other cohorts teamed up with them on their offline missions, but Julia wasn’t satisfied. She wanted the brutal attacks to seem more civilized. The first time Julia yelled at you was when you questioned her decision to bring parts of the legion’s choir to the offline missions.\n\n“Don’t you understand? We aren’t fucking troglodytes! We’re trying to *restore* the glory of civilization, not ruin it with some half-assed messy bullshit. Violence must always be shrouded in order and beauty or else it will be nothing more than savagery.” She calmed down, took a deep breath, and said, “The hymn must echo above the heads of the damned.”\n\nYou never questioned her again, and during the next mission—when a family house where the father was raping his daughter was invaded by Oliver’s cohort—the hymn of the legion was sung as the family watched Oliver and his boys strike the father over and over and over again with their bats until his spine snapped. And then you entered the house together with Julia, both wearing masks with neutral expressions, and Oliver and the others greeted you with their arms extended proudly.\n\n“Ave Imperator,” Oliver said and the others followed suit. “Ave Imperator!”\n\nYou saw that Julia was happy, and all the anxiety that you had felt after she yelled at you was immediately replaced with elation.\n\nAs it turned out, these offline missions were only a mere exercise. A bigger mission was being planned, a mission that Julia claimed would finally allow the cohorts to prove themselves to the legion. No one really knew what it was, but everyone still did the tasks they were given. One cohort was ordered to steal some materials from the woodwork room at school, another to acquire more capes and masks, and yet another to scout one of the poorest neighborhoods for a suitable location. Not even you knew all the details, although you knew the target: Los Bárbaros.\n\nOnce a location had been picked—a shabby soccer field behind an abandoned loading dock—the cohort managing target manipulation arranged a fake meeting with the street gang, posing as drug buyers. Los Bárbaros was a small group of six boys, considered a menace in the neighborhood but not viewed as anything more than pathetic thugs by the gangs who actually controlled the drug trade in the area. Hence, Los Bárbaros was most likely overjoyed when we reached out to them, giving them the illusion of not being wannabe gangsters anymore.\n\nEveryone who could sneak out at night was ordered to the soccer field. About twenty members from different schools managed to come, all wearing the red capes and masks that had been given to them earlier. They all hid from view in some bushes. Oliver’s cohort, together with you and Julia, were the only ones not hiding. Los Bárbaros arrived on their mopeds. It was too dark for them to see our masks from a distance, and when they noticed, they had reached the point of no return. Their leader snorted, taking a puff of his cigarette with a somewhat exaggerated motion of his hand as if to come off as larger than he really was.\n\n“What’s this, some kind of masquerade?”\n\nJulia took her mask off and exposed her calm face.\n\n“Julia, i-is that you?” one of the younger boys stuttered. “Guys, it’s Julia!”\n\n“What is going on here?” the leader said with uncertainty in his nasal voice. “What the fuck are you doing here?” He reached for a knife in his pocket. “Who the fuck are these motherfuckers, anyway? Crazy psycho bitch, just like your goddamn sister!”\n\nJulia appeared mostly calm, but she had tensed up her jaw.\n\n“We’re here to inform you that you have been sentenced to death for the horrendous crime committed toward my sister, Tavia Marcell, and for all subsequent crimes you’ve been committing ever since and would have continued to commit if you and your companions would have been allowed to live on.”\n\n“What the fuck did you just say to me, bitch?” the leader said, confused. “No one comes to my hood speaking to me like that. Threatening me with fancy words like some fucking—”\n\nOliver blew a trumpet that he had stolen from the music hall and the sound echoed solemnly between the concrete buildings that made up the neighborhood.\n\nSlowly, the others came out from their hiding spots, marching toward the center from the entrance as a solid column, making it impossible for Los Bárbaros to escape. The gang members pulled out their knives as they were surrounded by the legion. At the end of the column, one cohort dragged long wooden beams behind them.\n\n“Julia, what the fuck is this shit?” the leader said, his eyes darting around in a nervous fashion. “This ain’t funny.”\n\n“It’s the legion,” the youngest of the gang members said. “I have one of their members on my ICQ.” He put his knife on the ground with a trembling hand. “I-I’m sorry, I wasn’t involved... Tell them, tell them that I wasn’t there that night. Please.” He was begging his friends. “I’m innocent. Okay? Please.”\n\n“Pick up your knife, fucking coward!” the leader said. “These fucking dorks can’t do shit, you hear me? We are gonna cut’em up!”\n\nThe soldiers dragging the beams began nailing them together.\n\n“What are they doing, Julia?” the boy trying to save himself said. “I didn’t touch your sister… I promise. Please!”\n\nJulia didn’t pay him any attention. “Olivarius, execute the sentence.”\n\nLos Bárbaros tried to fight back, swinging their knives at everyone attacking them, but they didn’t stand a chance. They were beaten to the ground. Oliver’s cohort held them down. The leader of the gang went pallid as he must have realized that they would escape with neither lives nor honor.\n\n“P-please,” he begged, spitting blood, “let my little brother go… please. He didn’t do nothing, I swear, please!”\n\nHis brother wailed like a child as he begged, “Mom, please, Mom...”\n\n“You’re trying to defend him with the very crime he committed!” Julia exclaimed. “He knew, and yet he did nothing.”\n\n“What the fuck, no!” the leader yelled as he struggled even harder but still just as uselessly. “He’s just a kid—”\n\n“You didn’t seem to think so a moment ago,” Julia said, “when you asked him to pick up his knife.” She paused, ignoring their cries for mercy, and then she turned to Oliver and spoke with a stern voice, “Do it. Interficite barbaros.”\n\n“Centurion Filippus!” he yelled. “Commence the beating.”\n\nEvery soldier stepped forward and ritualistically broke every bone in the victims’ bodies with their baseball bats.\n\nAs Legion Legat, you didn’t have to participate in the beating. It was a great relief to you, as you never enjoyed hurting people, even if they were your enemies. All you had to do was stand beside Julia and watch all of this unfold in front of you. You had a clear view of their faces as their screams filled the air and their blood stained the ground.\n\nBefore they were dragged to the wooden beams, Oliver used one of their knives to cut their tongues out so that they wouldn’t be able to speak anymore. As he sliced the knife into their flesh, they screeched like feral animals and flailed about uselessly as they were restrained. After this, as if hit with a stroke of diabolical genius, he shouted toward his men:\n\n“Pull their pants down!” He was met with confusion. “Just do it, pull them down. We don’t got all night!”\n\nStill unsure, they looked upon Julia.\n\n“Follow your orders.” As she spoke, she looked at the members of Los Bárbaros with utter detestation in her eyes.\n\n“O-of course, Dominus.” With shaky hands, they began unbuttoning their pants.\n\nAs his private parts were exposed for everyone to see, tears finally formed in the eyes of the leader who had so far only dressed his agony in anger and hatred. Now, only a profound sadness remained on his tortured face. Once more, Oliver cut the knife into their flesh.\n\nOne of the legionaries at the back leaned forward and vomited behind his mask. Another one tried to get away but was stopped by one of the cohorts.\n\n“What the fuck are you doing?” The centurion grabbed him by the arm and forced him to stay. “You can’t leave.”\n\nThis was a watershed moment for the legion, as some of the members began to show considerable doubt for the first time. Only a few of the attending legionaries had been on violent offline missions prior. Some hadn’t even seen blood before, let alone been a part of such a heinous performance. As Oliver proceeded, Julia, sensing the doubt among the crowd, straightened her back and addressed the legionaries.\n\n“Crastati!” she shouted. “Crastati! Crastati! Crastati!”\n\nThe legionaries, caught up in the moment, began to chant along with her.\n\n\"Crastati! Crastati! Crastati! Crastati! Crastati!”\n\nThe group pressure was too much for the dissenters and they reluctantly joined in the chanting, forcing them to participate and share not just the twisted bacchanalian spirit of the group but also the blame for its actions. Julia made sure no one would return home with a clean conscience.\n\nOliver, feeling the support of the crowd, redoubled his efforts. Strange guttural noises of panic escaped the street gang’s bleeding, gurgling mouths as he proceeded with a sadistic smile. He then shoved their genitals into each other’s mouths to add to the humiliation. It was such a gruesome sight to behold that you didn’t dare to watch for too long. Instead, you turned your head toward Julia, who was the only one revealing her face at this time. She watched the execution with great pride in her eyes, and although you couldn’t stomach seeing the mutilation of these boys yourself, you felt happy for her.\n\nThe victims were then dragged to the wooden beams, and their wrists were nailed to the crossbeams. They were still conscious, although barely so, and they still tried to twist and turn in foolish attempts at escaping their humiliating fate. A placard was hung around their necks that read “RAPIST,” although Julia did refrain from placing it around the neck of the little brother, and then everyone helped with raising the beams and rooting them into the ground.\n\nWhen the crucifixion was complete and they were all slowly dying on their crosses, the choir began singing the hymn of the legion. And one by one everyone—even you, Benjamin—joined in on the singing as you watched the lives of Los Bárbaros come to their excruciating conclusion:\n\n&gt;*Dominus! Dominus! Dominus!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*You arrived the month of May*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*With a smile so glorious!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Oh, that unforgettable spring day.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*From Stockholm to Canberra*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*From the west to the east*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Barbarians roamed free on Terra*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Nothing could stop the beast!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Until you came...*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*From Remus and Romulus*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*You came in the month of May*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Dominus! Dominus! Dominus!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Oh, that unforgettable spring day.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Dominus! Dominus! Dominus!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*They took your sister away*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But you remain victorious*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*In the end, they shall pay*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Thus is the Roman way!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Over your sister you cried*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*We hear you as you say*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*That the empire never died!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*From Remus and Romulus*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*You came in the month of May*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Dominus! Dominus! Dominus!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Oh, that unforgettable spring day.*\n\nThe following day they were dead. This was the first time the work of the legion ended up on the news. Someone had taken a picture of the crosses in the morning haze before they were taken down. The news of the incident spread all over the world. During this time, the police still hadn’t taken notice of the legion, but you all knew that it was just a matter of time until they did. You became even more secretive than before. The Castrum was uploaded to a more secure server, and what we called the offline cohorts were divided into cells whose deeds were kept a secret from the rest of the legion.\n\nThese cohorts were mostly ordered to either recruit street gangs to the legion or to eradicate them. Oliver was promoted to general, and thus became the first member other than you and Julia allowed to wear a purple hood and cape. The crucifixions were limited to what were dubbed special representations of evil but were still carried out often enough during 1999 to keep making headlines all over the world.\n\nMost people seemed to believe it had something to do with Christianity, even though that didn’t make much sense, and that it all had been inspired by the coming turn of the millennium. The church found the practice particularly immoral and demanded a full-blown national investigation, but the general population soon realized that the victims were the kind of scum that the police had failed to do something about for years.\n\nNext year was ninth grade, the last year of high school. You still couldn’t fathom how much your life had changed since the days of the bullying. All that felt so far away for you now, almost as if it had happened in another life. Julia launched the Forum this year, and it quickly became a popular online community. Although she was still considered the Imperial Legate, you were the one administering most of the legion at this point.\n\nA few days before prom, Julia called you late one evening to ask you to be her date. This, above anything else, even though objectively it was far from the most extraordinary event to have happened since you met Julia, felt like the culmination of something much larger. Until now, what you and Julia had been sharing felt like a tentative, fragile thing—something that could’ve been easily broken or taken away. Before this, your relationship hadn’t felt quite real to you, as though at any moment you might wake up and discover that it was all just a dream. But this request felt different. It felt like a promise. For the first time, your love would be seen by others and that made it somehow truer than it had been before. For a moment, you just stared at the phone in disbelief, unsure of how to respond. But then, a wide smile spread across your face as you realized that finally, after all these years, you finally had someone.\n\n“Yes,” you said, barely able to contain your excitement. “Yes, of course, I’ll go to prom with you.”\n\nYou arrived at Julia’s house on prom night, flowers in hand and wearing the suit your dad had bought you for the occasion. You’d been so nervous sitting in the cab on the way there that you’d almost thrown up. You expected Julia’s parents to welcome you, but they were nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was Julia who answered the door.\n\n“Hey,” she said, smiling. She was wearing a beautiful white dress that flowed down to her feet with an intricate gold pattern stitched into the fabric. Her hair was done up in an elegant updo, and she was wearing a thin gold necklace with a small pendant. She reminded you of a Roman goddess.\n\n“You look beautiful,” you said, breathless. You felt like you were going to faint.\n\nJulia laughed and took your arm. “Come on, let’s go,” she said. “You came here in a cab, right?”\n\n“It’s waiting out front.”\n\n“Good,” Julia said. “Because I’m not sure I can walk in these heels.”\n\nYou laughed and helped her down the steps.\n\nEveryone stood up when you entered the school together, saluting both of you with outreached arms. It was one of the best days of your life. The school choir sang a beautiful rendition of *Bella Ciao*—a subtle nod to the presence of Julia and Legion Zero—and as the sun began to set, you and Julia walked out onto the dance floor, hand in hand. There, in front of everyone, you shared your first dance together. Oliver stood by himself at the edge of the room, watching as you danced and laughed and whispered secrets to each other. At one point, you saw him talking to one of his friends, and it looked like they were arguing. But soon enough, Oliver’s friend had walked away, leaving Oliver standing alone once again. And that’s when you saw it—clearer than ever before—the pain in his eyes, the hurt, and the jealousy. But even through all of that, he managed to smile and wave when your eyes accidentally met his. The night went on in a blur, and before you knew it, it was time to go.\n\nWhen you were leaving, Oliver sneaked up on both of you together with his closest men. He forced you into an alley where there were no witnesses. He had put on his hood and mask and held his baseball bat tight.\n\n“You love him?” Oliver said, radiating contempt as he spoke. “You love *him*?”\n\n“What are you doing here?” you asked. “Y-you can’t act like–”\n\nJulia placed her hand on your shoulder, calm as ever. “I love him, yes.”\n\nHearing this—which she had never told you before—sent a shockwave through your body. You turned to look at her, but she was staring at Oliver, unflinching.\n\n“No,” Oliver said. “There’s no way… I did everything you asked of me. I *killed* for you.”\n\n“And now you’ll kill us?” you asked. “Because she didn’t love you back?”\n\nHearing your voice triggered something within him, a rage you had never seen in his eyes before, and he looked back at his men as if to tell them to strike at his command. But just as he raised his black baseball bat, he fell to the ground. At first, you didn’t understand what had happened. Oliver touched the back of his head and looked at his hand, confused by the blood on his palm. His best friend, who had always been at his side, had struck him from behind with his bat. It was surreal for you to watch Oliver fall to the ground after being betrayed by his own friend. At that moment, everything he had done, everything he had made you go through over the years, felt like nothing. And yet, at the same time, it was strangely satisfying to see him get what he deserved.\n\n“I love you, Olivarius,” his friend said. “But I love the legion more.”\n\n“You son of a bitch!” Oliver hissed, holding back tears as his mask fell off. “I trusted you!”\n\n“Let the decimation commence,” Julia said. “I’m sorry it had to end this way, general. I’m grateful for everything you did for the legion… for me.”\n\nOliver, still sitting on the ground, looked up at his friends begging, “No, please, we don’t need them! Do you hear me? I’m your general, you have to follow my orders!”\n\n“I’m the general now,” his friend said. “You never understood the glory of the legion. For you, the legion was merely a means for violence, but it is violence that is merely a means for the legion… For civilization.”\n\n“B-but that’s just bullshit,” Oliver said. “We always joked about how ridiculous it all was!” He turned to Julia. All the rage had disappeared from his face and been replaced by what could only be described as resignation. Slowly, knowing full well he wouldn’t get out of this alive, he extended his arm in the form of the salute and said with an ironic, hateful smirk, “Ave Imperator, those who are about to die salute you.”\n\nThose were his last words, proving how much he had studied just to impress the woman he loved, before being clubbed to death by his own friends.\n\nUpper secondary school was different. Julia was accepted into yet another prestigious school. Neither your grades nor wealth was good enough for that school, but in the end, Julia hacked their records so that you could come with her. The legion only had a few members at that school, and the culture that had evolved at your former school didn’t exist here. No more secret salutes in the corridors, no more “salve, Dominus” every time you entered a room. For a while, your life felt somewhat normal again. But nothing had returned to normal, far from it.\n\nAt the beginning of 2001, cohorts had begun to form in other countries and the Forum became an international webpage. Every private message on the site was read and stored by the legion. At the end of the summer that year, a message sent through the site in Arabic was translated. It revealed a terrorist plot against the US, where a cohort had formed recently. It was promptly ordered to intervene, and on September 8, the perpetrators were stopped in their tracks. The legion ended up on the news the next day, described as a vigilante organization, although the crucifixions of the victims were described as unnecessarily cruel and difficult to understand.\n\nWith access to all the data generated through the Forum, the legion was able to spot more than just petty criminals and predators. It also identified corrupted politicians and conspiracies. Julia focused on a lot of the widespread corruption in Italy and also within the Vatican. She was opposed to any and all Abrahamic religions, but nothing could make her as upset as the Catholic church.\n\n“Monotheistic religions are the greatest corruption of man,” she said. “It’s like a virus of the mind, reprogramming the host’s brains… repurposing them to spread the disease at all costs. It’s beyond me how the freaking *Bible* gained more popularity than the *Odyssey*. It’s like comparing the phone book to great literature for fuck’s sake!”\n\nWhen powerful politicians and priests and so on began to appear hanging on crosses in empty fields, the legion was categorized as a terrorist organization—even though you always provided evidence of the crimes the victims had committed. Even though Julia had detached herself from the legion for quite some time and destroyed all evidence of her involvement, she was still worried that the police would arrest her.\n\nDuring the three years that followed before graduation, the Forum became one of the biggest online communities in the world. In 2004, Julia had already become a multi-millionaire. The youngest ever in your country. She formed her own company, called the Strix Corporation, and although she didn’t give you any position within the company, she made sure that you would never have to worry about money again.\n\nStrix made it possible for Julia to secretly fund the legion, but also to spread propaganda directly to the members—mostly the members living in Italy.\n\nAt this point, it makes little sense to continue telling the story in such great detail. You took the title of Imperial Legate while Julia became a public figure. Within the legion, she was never again referred to as Julia. Only as Caesar.\n\nSlowly, a strange kind of chaos erupted all over the world. In the west, the cohorts operated in the shadows with secret help from the ever-growing Strix Corporation. They assassinated key figures in high positions, burned down government buildings, tore down vanity projects wasting tax money, and attacked failing institutions. All of this caused civil unrest and radicalization both within the population and among politicians. Julia called it anti-social engineering.\n\nThe legion didn’t work as much in the shadows in the Middle East. There, the cohorts were provided firepower to fight back against dictatorships and terrorist groups. At the same time, the Forum fed the population with more and more propaganda, pointing their rage in whatever direction Julia saw fit.\n\nIn 2010, Julia made the decision to move back to Italy where she bought a small private island off the coast of Sicily. There, she began the construction of the company’s new headquarters. The building complex was huge, and when it was finished it looked like an ancient Roman palace made out of black marble. Julia’s new home became known as the Villa Strix.\n\nThis became your life. You moved into Julia’s palace and controlled the legion through secure channels. And you were happy, happy to share your life with Julia.\n\nJulia often sat behind her massive desk in her gigantic marble office, and every time you walked by her, watching her work or staring at the world map with dreamy eyes, you felt like the luckiest man in the world. You thought back on your life, on those horrible days before Julia saved you with her warm embrace, and you shuddered at what life would have been like if you had never met her. That’s why I know reading this is so hard for you. After all, from where you are right now, you’re still just a boy in love.\n\nIn 2019, there were massive protests against the Catholic Church in Rome, a direct result of the constant revelations of child abuse within the church. Julia wouldn’t let them live it down, and constantly fed Forum members with news about the atrocities. At the same time, she had worked hard on pushing Italy out of the European Union, and by the end of 2020, the nation voted to leave. She secretly formed a political party in Italy called SPQR, which grew exponentially with the help of the resources from the Strix Corporation and the unrest created by the legion’s anti-social engineering. At the start of the new decade, there was a general feeling in the air that something was about to change in the world.\n\nSPQR won the general election in Italy in 2023. At this time, there was a second revolution in Iran, instigated by the legion. The new government was inspired by the so-called Neo-Ancient Movement in Italy and applied similar rhetoric but with regard to the Persian empire. A man named James Khavari became the first emperor of Persia in more than two thousand years. He allied with Italy and the Russian Federation and thus created tensions that hadn’t been felt since the Cold War.\n\nJulia took the title of Roman Empress in 2030. The very next day, the Catholic Church was declared a pedophile ring, which was possible after years of actual cases and exaggerated propaganda. During a great ceremony, the Pope was arrested and forced to hand over his authority and all of the Church properties to the SPQR.\n\nThis decision made sense, even though the reasoning behind the arrest was a bit disingenuous, because there couldn’t be two emperors within the borders of Rome. The legion, once nothing more than a bunch of kids, joined the growing movement and became the first legion in the new Roman army.\n\nTensions reached their boiling point in 2045. James Khavari allowed the Russians to place nuclear missiles on the border of Iran, forcing the US to counteract. No one really knew what set it off, if it was planned or an accident, but on the 27th of January that year, Tehran was engulfed in a light a thousand times brighter than the sun, and a few hours later, Jerusalem was reduced to rubble. There was so much confusion during these hours. Usually, when something big happened in the world, there were people recording it with their devices, but this time was different. There was silence for the first time in a long time and simply lost contact. What followed was the footage of mushroom clouds, and the silence was replaced by a global outcry of anguish.\n\nYou ran into Julia’s chamber. She was in a meeting with one of her greatest engineers—Elonius—and they were both looking at her huge world map. The golden laurel wreath glimmered on her head as if she was partaking in a ceremony. There was even a butler in the room holding a silver tray with a wine glass on it. But when you entered, all of their attention was on you.\n\n“Benius,” she said when she saw you, “it has finally happened! After all these years, the docile and degenerate western civilization is falling. The barbarians are eradicated once and for all! Can you imagine? The Senate is being moved to the bunkers as we speak, and I’ll join them shortly together with the imperial guard. I want you to bring two of our legions to Provincia Britannia as soon as possible to make sure the territory is secured after the fallout.”\n\n“Y-you did this?” you asked in disbelief. “This was you?”\n\n“We did it together.” She looked at you as if surprised by your question. “It wouldn’t have been possible without you—”\n\n“I-I didn’t sign up for this,” you said. “Not *this*.” Your lower lip trembled. “The other things: the beatings, the crucifixions… Sure. Those people were evil. We had a *purpose*. That’s what you always said. But this—”    \n\n“There’s no difference.” She walked closer to you. “You know that. This was necessary, Benius. What did you think the hymn of the legion was about? It was about this moment. It has always been about this! My sister was raped twice. Once by a group of thugs, and then again by the society who let them get away with it. And now, just like Los Bárbaros, Western civilization will be destroyed.”\n\nYou felt her words like an iron fist. A long moment of silence followed. You couldn’t believe what was happening. The woman you once thought was so kind and wise had just destroyed half the world. What kind of person could do something like that?\n\n“But my dad—” you whispered. “He’s still in Stockholm.”\n\nYou hadn’t seen your dad since you moved to Italy, but you had planned to visit him over Christmas. A Christmas that was never going to happen now.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Julia said, “but there’s nothing we can do about that. The decision has been made. Besides, nuclear war can’t be planned precisely enough to know exactly when it’s going to happen. It’s almost like giving birth.” She stopped as if to admire her own phrasing. “The world is changing, Benius, and we have to change with it.” She embraced you, and as your body tensed up, she whispered in your ear: “Our love has finally conquered the world.”\n\nYour life had been turned upside down in the span of a day. All the luxuries and comforts you had grown accustomed to were gone in an instant, replaced by the harsh reality of a nuclear winter. You rushed out of the room, grabbed a phone, and desperately tried to call your dad, but there was no answer. In the end, you learned that Stockholm had been hit by one of the first bombs. And you never heard from your dad again.\n\nThe post-nuclear conquest of Britain was easy. You spent over two years in the rubble of London. Julia was content, happier than you had ever seen her before. But this was too big of a sacrifice for you. Again, I know it will be difficult to understand this from where you are standing right now. You have just discovered love. Your childhood dream of finally being loved has come true. But, please, believe me… You’re only occupying a small part of Julia’s mind. She’s already, while you’re reading this message, seeing the crucifixions; she’s already seeing the missiles cross the oceans… already seeing the laurel wreath around her beautiful head. If you read her diary, you’ll see that I’m telling you the truth.\n\nAt the end of eighth grade, she’ll bring you up on the roof of the school. There, watching the city, she’ll tell you that she can see patterns that no one else can see. And she will tell you that a great decline is coming, a great stagnation, and what she calls a boring dystopia followed by an end with no subsequent beginning. She will joke, “Someone should turn it off and on again.” That’s your cue. That’s your only chance to change the course of history and save civilization. No one will be looking. You have to push her. As I said before, I know how unimaginably difficult this will be for you. I know this… because I’m you, Benjamin.\n\nBut however happy Julia made me, it’s not worth the death of billions. It’s not worth the death of my father. I trust you’ll believe me after seeing the pictures, and that you’ll do the right thing. Mankind depends on it.\n\nI’ve attached a formula that you should be able to make using ordinary medicine and some equipment from the chemistry lab at school. If you consume it on the same day as the murder, you’ll forget most of that year including the act itself. I can only hope that it will help you live a normal life after your heroic deed.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI cried at the end of the letter. This was the missing piece of the puzzle, the reason I had felt so confused about what happened all my life. I had doomed myself to save a doomed world. The following year, I moved to London. I wouldn’t have written this if it weren’t for the fact that I already succeeded. I’ve infiltrated the Leif Andersson Institute. And tomorrow I’ll send a new e-mail back to 1998, telling myself not to listen to the first one.\n\nI’ll save her, and I’ll save the life we were supposed to have together. I don’t know if the timeline will change in an instant, or if it will happen gradually, but it *will* happen. My misery will finally be over. And Julia shall live [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/).",

        "text": "There was a legend about this village, that was told to me by my grandmother.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany centuries ago the Sky God would protect our village from the vengeful Storm God.   However, one day the Sky God fell in love with a woman.  One day he was tending to the skies when he heard the songs of angels coming from the world of men below.  The Sky God came down to our village to see a beautiful young maiden tending to her fields upon the hills.  When she saw him, she bowed before him.   She told him that the god of Death has taken her family and she was all that was left, her husband had died in battle and she had just lost a child.  As she cried the Sky God wiped her tears and embraced her.  The Storm God, who was jealous of the love they had, blew the maiden away and off the cliff, to her death.  The Sky God would spend eternity frantically looking for her all over the earth, asking the Sun to shine its light far away.  The Storm God, triumphant in his revenge, blew a storm to cover the village in a never-ending winter.  \"And that is why\", my grandmother said, \"it always snows in our village, and we never see the sun.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember very little about my grandma.  The smell of the hot tea she would make.  The soft and sweet perfume.  I'm starting to forget what she looked like, now in my later years.  However, I was only a child when I would see her, and pretty soon she passed away.  Sometimes I need to remember she loved me, if that is all she can be remembered by, other than that story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat cliff had become a legend in our village, so much that a lot of teenagers would challenge each other when it was late at night to walk out into the snowy cliff and guess the name of the woman who the Storm God had taken away.  Many names were guessed.  \"Chi\"  \"Rin\"  \"Yu\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, one night a girl was abused when she could not talk and her group of friends demanded that she speak and guess a name.  When she couldn't, they tried to push her off the cliff.  As she fell, she cursed them.   And I don't know about my grandmother's fairy tale.  But about that curse...  it's real.  Otherwise I wouldn't be telling you this story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee, over the years those \"friends\" of this girl would walk to the edge of this cliff and they would feel very dark and strong feelings.  Feelings of hopelessness....   feelings of fear.......   the cold.  And one by one, every single one of them committed suicide, jumping off that cliff to their death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 16 my parents were getting a divorce.  They had been fighting and yelling and my sister, who was 9 at the time, was a very quiet girl.  She had soft little sniffles and I always thought she was annoying.  Especially for how I thought at the time she was dealing with it.  The fighting between us all got only worse and worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt school, I had my own problems.  I never could please everyone, everyone wanted me to be something I'm not, like someone giving me a name I do not want.  My teachers were constantly disappointed in my performance at schoolwork.   All of the anxiety and pressure, multiplied by my own feelings led me to contemplate jumping myself.  Or as I put it, \"let the wind carry me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that night I snuck out and went to the cliff.  I felt dark and alone.  I don't know what else was going through my head, other than \"I give up, please end it all.  Please take me away.  Let the wind carry me\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was when my little sister came behind me.  She probably wanted me to come home.  So I ignored her.  That was when I noticed my parents coming behind her, running after her.  Was she running away?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo sooner could I think than that's when I saw her body run past me and off the cliff below me.  All I could do was stop and stare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we got home, both my parents were speaking together for the first time in years.  They both comforted me and told me that part of growing up is accepting loss.  They told me to follow their example, and \"never cry.  That kind of weakness isn't allowed anymore.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I looked at their faces, I saw different people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are so many things I wish I could ask my parents about that night, there is so much that I do not know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is one thing, however, that I do know.  It is simply this.  We are so terrible at trying to be so good at hiding our true emotions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYears later and I come back to that cliff every so often and I still feel dark and cold.  Alone.  I think of my little sister.  I even talk to her sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night I felt a dark presence.  I looked and there was a woman in a white robe floating above the cliff in front of me.  I saw the face of a woman that was not my sister.  She was so angry.  Everything about her was cold and icy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought of how much I hated my sister.  Why did she have to die instead of letting me go?  Why am I still alive?  I feel so helpless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman in white spoke.  \"I.......  fell........\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Bring...... someone.....\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Bring someone......  you love\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout thinking, I said, \"alright, sure.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later, I moved to America where I got an office job at a job placement center.  It was always a little funny to me that my job was to help others get jobs as well.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne coworker of mine was a beautiful young woman whose name was Emily.  Emily was exuberant,  she would always find new ways to make a boring workday more and more exciting.  I fell for her and fell for her hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had just started dating when she told me that she is a skier and she loves to find new slopes to try.  Upon hearing that I never skied before, she took me to the Rockies.  We spent a couple of days there as she gave me a tutorial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Keep your legs straight, your feet forward.  When you want to turn, turn on your feet.  When you want to stop, cross your feet like this.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmily then demonstrated.  I was a beginner so we started on a green circle even though she complained that I wouldn't feel the breeze going that slow.  Emily, with little effort, glided across the snow around me  I eventually got the hang of it.... so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was going very fast when I suddenly lost control and crashed into another skier.  Luckily, our injuries were somehow minor fractures but I had to be hospitalized for treatment with an overnight stay and found myself in a temporary wheelchair.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt hurt my pride to have Emily push me around and she was actually crying that we couldn't keep skiing together.  She told me that her parents took her skiing ever since she was a little girl but they both died in a car accident and she likes to remember them any way she could because she loves them and misses them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's fun to feel so liberating,\" she said, \"and let the wind carry me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe took a plane to my home village.  I wanted to show her my past since she showed me her parent's old cabin in Colorado.  I felt it only fair to show Emily what she showed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents were still alive.  And still married after 47 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I introduced them to Emily they loved her, almost like she had been living with us our whole lives.  They were getting the tea ready when my mother spoke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You should hear this town legend.  My mother used to tell my son here all the time.  Let me see....  a long time ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Mom, she doesn't want to hear the story.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yes she does child, now.... a long time ago the Sky God fell in love with a young woman.  Poor thing.  When the Storm God found out, he blew her off the cliff and that's why it'll always snow here.  Even the weather doesn't like how that story ended,\" she added in between sips of tea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmily was entranced.  She had to see this cliff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remembered what the women in white said to me, and I knew Emily was going to-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmily was already gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went out in the snow as a blizzard suddenly came, blowing icy chills that I had forgotten in my decade or more in adulthood.  This childhood adversity of chill and wind wasn't enough to stop me, however.  I knew a shortcut to the cliff above our village.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n400 feet up the snow I kept climbing as the wind howled and there was no sign of Emily.  Still I walked up the snow.  Laughing as I remember my father telling me all the stories of his winters being the worst, and with nothing to compare it to for me, winter is winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time I had reached the cliff, I was out of air when I noticed nothing was there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cried, \"EMILY!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"........I always liked that name.  Emily.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat sound.  It couldn't be.  The wind howled as I practically teetered over the edge.  The cliff below me beckoning like jaws of true death.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"....Who-who are you\"  I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...........I took the form of the one you call Emily.  Thank you for loving me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmotions froze inside me all over.  So many.  \"Everything was a lie?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...........Yes, I am afraid.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Are you the woman from the story about the Sky Go-\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...........No, and I always HATED THAT STORY!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe contorted and her eyes shone with a face truly like lightning.  I felt real fear like my body was about to burst in death that instant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this is the girl who was bullied off the cliff, guessing the name of a nameless woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"............I always hated everything.  For 70 years all I had was hate.  Until you came along.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What did I do?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\".........I saw you. .......I saw......  your sister......\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTears began to form in my eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You saw my sister?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\".....  It's me..... \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I had a horrific thought.  My sister died in 1999.  Emily was born in 1999.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo.  It couldn't be. Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReincarnation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe girl who simply came with the wrong group.  My little sister born to the wrong family.  The woman who fell in love with the wrong man.  They all shared the same soul?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what to think.  It was completely overwhelming.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas this the curse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman, or Emily, began to fade away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wait!  When will I see you again?  How can I find you?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\".....find me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with that, she was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was about 2018.  I decided to stay in my village.  I had to find her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a few days ago I was recently put in charge of a nursery in our village when an inconspicuous 5-year old girl found her way out of the nursery.  She was quite the rambunctious little toddler.  Then it occurred to me.  I know this girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen no one was looking, I took the girl in my arms up the 400 foot cliff and held her over the cliff.  It was time for her to be reincarnated, right?  That bullied girl from almost a century ago wants this.  My sister wants this. Emily wants this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't care if I go to prison.  I can already hear their words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Let the wind carry me.\"",

        "text": "Back in high school I had some friends who were wiccan. They told me some stories about them using a ouija board and I was intrigued so after a couple times using it and being mildly entertained a very interesting experience happened. Up to this point the times I used it could be chalked up to the ideomotor action. But this time my wiccan friend and I were in the back seat of another one of our friend's car with her in the driver and another friend in the passenger while we played in the back seat. She asked it the usual questions \"is there anyone there?\" \"Whats your name?\" \"how are you speaking to us right now?\" But then I wanted to ask a question, I asked \"can you prove you're real?\" The board responded with \"how\" I asked \"can you manipulate something in the real world besides just the planchette\" then the board kept repeating itself saying \"brightside\" over and over and over again that's all it would say \"brightside brightside brightside\" the girl and I were very confused. I kept looking out the car window looking at different lights looking to see if any were flickering or just acting odd, after about 20 minutes of the board repeating itself and us two looking around for whatever it was talking about the girl in the driver's seat spoke up and said to look at her air freshener hanging from her review mirror, when I looked up at it, it was spinning very intensely almost to the point it had no more room to spin then it would go the other way and again it was twisting itself almost all the way before going back again, I have no idea how long it had been doing so but it was interesting to say the least, what made it even more interesting was that on the air freshener it had the phrase \"look on the brightside\" after realizing what was going on we quickly said goodbye and we went our separate ways. I continued to play the game with her younger brother, nothing that convincing ever happened again and eventually every time him and I would play after asking for their name the board would only respond with \"zozo\" and while interesting at first because that is apparently the name of a demon associated with ouija boards it got pretty stale and I stopped playing completely. Still the brightside incident remains the only time that I've ever been completely convinced that the board wasn't fake and something more supernatural had happened. Plus I've had a couple of other experiences happen to me that I can't explain that made me want to completely stop associating myself with the board because of how scary it had gotten and they almost made me feel crazy when I would tell others about them, if this gets some views and you're interested in hearing about those lmk, I only have two other experiences I can vividly remember at the moment one time involving the most terrifying sound I've ever heard and another when I was laying in bed watching youtube, lmk which one you'd like to hear about and I might decide to share those experiences with you too but right now I need to go to bed for work and just thought I'd get this memory down before it vanishes in my mind forever, thank you for reading.",

The more I try to figure it out the deeper my headache becomes. \r\n\r\nWe've been walking for a few minutes before who I assume is the man running things decides to speak again. \r\n\r\n“Well, you two are here, don’t you have any questions? “ He says cordially. \r\n\r\n“Who are you? “ Mike says, his tone pure business. \r\n\r\n“Glad you asked, I always feel like an asshole explaining things unprompted. \r\n\r\nI’m what’s in charge of the mountain, not that the mountain is my only project, but getting into that is just going way off track. \r\n\r\nI am what designed the path, your hazards, your trials, and, of course, the promised reward. \r\n\r\nI’m not actually just this beautiful shell, but, going around in my birthday suit makes people a little edgy. \r\n\r\nYou could call me a Demigod, or force of nature, demon, angel, whatever helps. Any of the  above is within spitting distance.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a name, call me Arthur. “ The speech sounds well rehearsed, I shiver thinking of how many people this thing has sent through it’s cosmic meat grinder. \r\n\r\n“Why do you do this to people? “ I ask. \r\n\r\n“Sorry Kev, but that, unfortunately, isn’t a question I can answer. Right now anyway. \r\n\r\nYou see, I have an offer for the two of you. One I don’t just give every Joe Six-pack that walks in my door. \r\n\r\nDon’t get me wrong, you two are entitled to your reward as stated. And the mountain is everything I’ve promised, infinite pleasure at no cost. Indulging every vice and fantasy till the end of time with nothing in the way. \r\n\r\nThat being said, cards on the table here… oh, shit, is that a little too soon? \r\n\r\nMike, I can’t rewind your timepiece. You are ten steps removed from anywhere you should be, and frankly I’m surprised you haven’t popped, liquefied, or turned into something strange. \r\n\r\nBut that also means that we could work, very well together. Unique is very good in my field. “ His slick, used car dealer reply ends with us entering the mountain’s interior. \r\n\r\nCaves, cracks and nooks, spiraling infinitely upwards, extending past what should be a horizon, a world scaled honeycomb of hidden contents, creatures, and intent. \r\n\r\nI catch brief flickers of things moving, flitting from the shadows, or watching from concealment. \r\n\r\n“Doesn’t look like much from the outside, but everything you want is in those caves. Vice without consequence, until the lights go out on reality. No monkeys paw bullshit, just what you earned getting here. \r\n\r\nBut, indulge me here, let me see if I can sweeten the pot for you two. “ Arthur whispers something In a language I won’t even guess at and from a granite wall springs an office door that would seem normal if not for it’s location. \r\n\r\nThere’s a sense of vertigo, of displacement as we walk through, Arthur seems unbothered. \r\n\r\nWe find ourselves walking through what appears to be an upscale office building. Sharp dressed people of various ages and looks mill about. \r\n\r\n“Confused are we? \r\n\r\nWell, you guys are getting to see how the sausage is made, so to speak. \r\n\r\nI’m going to go out on a limb and assume that neither of you know exactly how things really work, so I’m going to speak in really broad terms. \r\n\r\nDo you know the difference between living creatures and God’s? \r\n\r\nNot the obvious, but in the grand scheme of things?\r\n\r\nGods started out with unlimited power, a handful controlling every aspect of every corner of reality. \r\n\r\nBut, as things are want to do, they reproduced, and found that with every generation, their offspring became weaker, less connected to the void. \r\n\r\nHumans, on the other hand, well, give them enough time and food, they just become more capable. “ Arthur pauses as we reach an oak door, stained a dark brown. \r\n\r\nWe enter his office, and find ourselves sitting across from him, his granite topped desk separating us. \r\n\r\n“But what does that have to do with you? \r\n\r\nIt’s simple. \r\n\r\nMy brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, they run their universe changing, esoteric, mindfuck, religion spawning, bullshit. Trapping people in ‘games’ they could play for 30 years and not realize it. \r\n\r\nMe? I’m just a young guy, couple thousand years old, couldn’t get involved with that mess if I wanted to, so I’ve made it my business to give everyone, God and mortal, what they want. \r\n\r\nAnd what I’ve found, is people want entertainment, and they want their dreams, even their nightmares, to come true. Even if they don’t realize it. \r\n\r\nSo, I find a legend, like you’ve seen, and I make it real, or real enough anyway. People didn’t find the path, they wanted it, and  I made it. \r\n\r\nAnd then I take their struggle, and sell it to those able to pay the bill. The void touched get the most out of it, they feed on suffering, but you’d be surprised at how many bored rich people buy a recording or two.\r\n\r\nEveryone you see here is someone from one of my projects, or someone they care about they brought into the fold, a person I’ve given a little spark of myself to. That little bit of power is something seekers of esoterica would kill to have, something that makes the pleasures and reward of the mountain look like a consolation prize. \r\n\r\nI’m a fuckin Chad, but even I need my support staff. \r\n\r\nAnd you two, christ on the cross, you’d be a get. \r\n\r\nMike, don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re a fucking dead zone. I can’t read a single thought in those scrambled eggs of yours.  \r\n\r\nNow Kev, I could make pluck out his own eyes, but you, not so much. It’s like trying to tune into static. “ I’m hanging on Arthur’s words, but then my heart stops, I’m holding a wickedly pointed brass letter opener millimeters from my eye, “See? Easy as hell, can’t even work up a sneeze with you. \r\n\r\nI can’t get you back where you came from, but I’ll give you a job back where Kev and Rabbit call home, one that would have you putting out the lights of things worse than Dahmer five days a week. \r\n\r\nOh, shit, Kev, sorry, put that down. “\r\n\r\nWithout input on my part I replace the letter opener to it’s exact position on the desk. This thing’s control over me is effortless, horrifying. \r\n\r\n“Don’t think you’re the ugly girl at the prom there Kev. \r\n\r\nThe mountain has been a pretty big hit for a long time, but honestly, it’s getting a little stale. For lack of a better term, ratings are down, it’s not worth the investment, and we need something new. \r\n\r\nI want something to appeal to these waves of new blood, half century , analog horror, God scraps. Half of them are so removed from the void, they might as well just be humans. So, who better to design the next project that you? A human who managed to navigate the path without turning into a cult leader, or psychopath. “ Arthur’s offer scares me and makes me want to spit in his face. \r\n\r\n“Why did you kill him? “ I say, point blank, my voice tired, and thin. \r\n\r\n“Yeah, thought that would be the deal breaker. \r\n\r\nI could tell you about the minutia for hours, try and justify my position, but that was your best friend, so I won’t. \r\n\r\nYour buddy was a fucking genius, and he thought that by raining on my parade, he’d be doing the world some good. He was probably right. \r\n\r\nI sat him down, explained that, right or wrong, I’m the guy with his finger on the trigger. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t listen Kev. I tried talking, I tried scaring the man, I tried letting him go, no strings attached. \r\n\r\nBut he spent his life learning, and he came here with a plan that would have worked, he wasn’t about to let that go. But I can’t let my projects suffer because some guy has moxy and a bug up his ass. \r\n\r\nIf it helps, it was quick, basically just flipped off his light switch. Soul intact, sitting wherever it should be. “ The answer is too simple, too blunt, but I don’t know what else I was expecting. This path has been full of callous, utilitarian death. \r\n\r\nArthur gives us a week to decide, to familiarize ourselves with his staff and the mountain. \r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few pin up gals fond of leather, I never really understood what people meant when they would talk about something being so horrifying it was beautiful, but the caves and grottos of the mountain  were fascinating and horrifying in equal measure. \r\n\r\nOf course, I could only see a tiny fraction of what was there, but each tier was a hedonistic mega city of focus to some vice or another. \r\n\r\nThe deeper one travels, the less human the inhabitants become, their bodies changing to accommodate amounts of drugs, food or… activities well beyond human tolerances. \r\n\r\nThis is a heaven for the broken, those changed so much by life, or the path, that their reward needs to be myopic and paranormal in scale. \r\n\r\nI found myself deep within  what I could only describe as a heroin enclave, watching twisted people, almost stick-bug like in appearance scuttle into and out of dimly lit cracks and holes. It was two days into our week, Mike takes a seat on the cliff face beside me, his approach silent, as always. \r\n\r\n“Any thoughts? “ He says, drinking from a silver flask. The booze smells old and expensive. \r\n\r\n“Do I want to be a junkie for eternity, or torture people for a living? No, haven’t been able to come to an easy conclusion on that one. “ I say, wearing my heart on my sleeve. \r\n\r\n“Can I ask you a question? \r\n\r\nLet’s say the worst man on earth is in a hospital. You know this guy is going to kill a million people. For a fact. \r\n\r\nDo you set the hospital on fire? “ The question seems out of left field, but Mike seems serious. \r\n\r\n“Sure, I guess. If it’s empty. “ I reply. \r\n\r\n“Okay, but what about if it isn’t? \r\n\r\nWhere does collateral damage turn into murder? “ Wind gusts as Mike lets the question hang. \r\n\r\n“ 1, 50, 1000, I don’t fucking know Mike, why are you throwing more impossible questions my way? And if you’re cooking something up, probably best not to be talking about it.” I’m aggressive, the never ending stress and fear starting to fry my emotions. \r\n\r\n“I’ve never thought that question was hard. \r\n\r\nWhich is why, I can never  trust my judgement completely. \r\n\r\nSee, to me, as long as that hospital has anything lower than 999,999 people in it, I’m the good guy. \r\n\r\nI think I have a third option that at least gets you home. And don’t worry about Art, if he could see what I’m doing, he’d have noticed the half alive body of one of his peons I’ve been working on. He’s no fucking God, he’s a sadistic universal glitch. \r\n\r\nBut that option, it’s going to be messy. And while, to me, no one that chose to come here is innocent, I’m aware most people wouldn’t feel the same. “ There is no jester’s edge to Mike’s words, he seems like he’s trying to justify his course of action to himself as much as anybody else. \r\n\r\n“Regardless, I thought we couldn’t hurt them, or Art? He let you try that out with your cane, didn’t he? “ My question is only delaying the inevitable, but it’s better than making this decision. \r\n\r\n“Yep, and that’s where I noticed the first cracks in arts little façade. \r\n\r\nCouldn’t put a scratch on him or the handful of idiots he brought in, not with my hands, not with my cane. \r\n\r\nBut the next day, I noticed something interesting. Guy spills coffee on himself, fresh out of the pot, screams like a son of a Bitch, starts taking off his shirt trying to get it off. \r\n\r\nI chalk it up to force of habit. \r\n\r\nNow, screaming when you spill coffee on yourself, that’s one thing, but when I saw the paper cut, it came together. No one bleeds out of force of habit. \r\n\r\nArt made this place, but he isn’t omnipotent, he isn’t omnipresent, there are cracks, flaws, and the best part is, he’s too much of an egotistical prick no know they are there. \r\n\r\nI can’t shut this place down, but I can do what I’m good at, and cause a massive amount of blood soaked chaos, should be good enough for you to run out the fire escape, metaphorically speaking. “ There is subtext to what Mike is saying. A moral weight of this decision that extends well past whether I live or die. \r\n\r\n“That still leaves the fire escape. “ I say, a ‘yes’ in all but the literal sense. \r\n\r\n“You have to leave me a little bit of mystery Kev, it’s my thing. “ I think Mike is half way through a sentence, but by the time I turn to him, he’s gone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow would you adapt in my situation, getting let behind the curtain, seeing the pullies and gears of the murder machine that has been killing your friends? \r\n\r\nPersonally, I got to know people. \r\n\r\nMike was around less and less, and with each passing hour sitting alone in the sterile, sparsely furnished room, my fear of Art finding out what Mike was doing and taking it out on me grew.\r\n\r\nSo, I made friends. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t hard, most people here had been through some variant of hell, some legend flavored gauntlet that tore them up, mind body and soul. \r\n\r\nBut everyone had nothing but nice things to say about Art. Chilling considering the path to the mountain, comparatively, was a milder one of his ‘Projects’. \r\n\r\nThe staff, outside of their jobs, live normal, albeit, charmed lives. Paid enough to never worry about material things, and given enough of ‘the void’ to never age,  get sick, break a bone, or choke on a grape. \r\n\r\nTwo days pass and I find myself sitting in a lunch room, a half dozen members of staff around me, asking me when I plan on signing up for real. At this point it’s all but decided that I’ll be a member of the team, and they couldn’t be happier. \r\n\r\nHad the dice rolled slightly different, I’d have taken art up on his offer, became one of these more than human office drones.  But my destiny isn’t peace, or answers. \r\n\r\nLights flicker briefly, not a rare occurrence, despite some deep contacts in the government, getting electricity to somewhere not quite in this world is, complicated, to say the least. \r\n\r\nBut when we are plunged into pitch darkness 5 minutes later, chuckles turn into nervous silence. \r\n\r\nI want to ask you again. \r\n\r\nHow would you feel? \r\n\r\nYou know what’s coming, and so did I. \r\n\r\nWould you feel vindicated? Invincible? The eye of a storm of violence? \r\n\r\nI didn’t.  \r\n\r\nI know this is it, and I know that no matter how smart, how fearsome, and how violence prone Mike is, we are going up against something that claims to be a God. Even if it’s full of shit, it’s doing a great impression. \r\n\r\nI have no information on the plan, or what it might entail, and to be completely honest with you, I have no assurances it’s for my benefit. \r\n\r\nSo, I don’t feel excited, or powerful. I feel afraid, alone and at the whim of nothing but Lunatics, and demons. \r\n\r\nRed hazard lights turn on with an industrial clacking noise. My companions in matching black dress pants and white shirts look into the hallway, quiet greets them. \r\n\r\nMitchell, a large man, 300 or so years old but not looking a day over 30 leaves the room, calling to friends and coworkers. \r\n\r\nThere is a plastic clicking noise, and what might be a gasp. I know, one way or the other, someone is dead or dying. \r\n\r\n5 immortals are frozen in fear, as slow, methodical footsteps come toward the room. \r\n\r\nFrom deep within the non Euclidean office building there is noise of panic and pain. I run through all the little tips and tricks Mike liked to talk about when the early hours of the morning turned into narcotic breakfast. \r\n\r\n“What’s happening, Art’s family doing something again? “ Tabitha says, with all of the ages she could have chosen, she looks well past her prime, severe, and pale. The type of swallow, soulless look, I’d expect of everyone here. \r\n\r\nTabby realizes she’s only talking to 3 other people. In an instant, something had taken 2 people  out of the room. \r\n\r\nTabitha, myself, and two twins, Maxine and Max, sit in silence, vague, ominous noises coming from the hallway. \r\n\r\n“ For your own sakes, just do what he says. “ I say, deadpan. \r\n\r\nIf I had a choice, I’d have called the whole thing off at this point. Signed up to be a paranormal producer, and let the world keep spinning just the way it has. \r\n\r\nBut what enters the crimson room can be accurately described as the personification of my lack of choice. \r\n\r\nIt's Mike, as… Mike as I’d ever seen him. Soot blackened coat torn, garish costume drenched in blood and damage, he saunter into the room. Something is off, I can’t quite put my finger on it. \r\n\r\n“It’s just this asshole? “ Tabitha says, voice dripping with distain. \r\n\r\nThe staff were evasive about exactly what Art’s gift entailed, but this, frail, old woman moves in a blur toward the wild eyed clown there was no way he would be quick enough to avoid her. \r\n\r\nBut he didn’t need to be. \r\n\r\nShe impales herself just below the jaw line, Mike has a death grip on a brass letter opener, in the same style as Art’s. \r\n\r\nHer distorted screams raise in pitch as he lifts her, bone cracking, dull, brass blade working its way past soft palate and into sinus. \r\n\r\nMike looks up as if doing a scene from Shakespeare. A twist of the blade stops the ancient female from being able to scream without giving her the mercy of death. \r\n\r\n“Oh, you mean Mike? \r\n\r\nOh no tabby, I’m not that clown. \r\n\r\nSee, Mike, he likes to play to win, he has goals, concerns, all that stupid shit. He likes to play to win. \r\n\r\nBut I’m the guy who comes out to play when shit’s hit the fan, call me Giggles. “ That voice, I don’t know if this is an act, with Mike, maybe it doesn’t matter, but there is a deep, vindictive bent to it. \r\n\r\nThe twins try to help their friend, but Mike uses her body as a shield, every twist or plunge of the blade making the two pause. \r\n\r\nI can’t control my breathing, I begin to shake, this isn’t what I wanted, this isn’t what any of these people deserve. \r\n\r\nSomething hits me in the face, light, a folded sheet of paper, a bloody fingerprint like a wax seal on one side. \r\n\r\nBy the time Mike manages to finish Tabitha off her body is a mangled wreck, the brass blade in just about the same state. \r\n\r\nHe casts it aside, sitting casually on a cheap table. \r\n\r\nOne twin runs, thinking the clown to be disarmed, Max, begins to beg for his life, making esoteric oaths of fealty I’m sure Mike neither understood nor cared about. \r\n\r\nMike gains max’s attention, slowly taking off his top hat, like a stage magician he pulls something from it, something small, and deformed, looking absolutely confused as to the situation it finds itself in. \r\n\r\nI don’t know what I expected, but it wasn’t what happened. \r\n\r\nAfter a drawn out moment of holding the kitten, Mike throws the thing, like a God damned softball, directly into Max’s face. \r\n\r\nThere was a noise like an auditory skip, and a tiny dull flash of something that might have been related to light. \r\n\r\nThe feline, was fine, unperturbed even, now rolling, blood stained on the floor. \r\n\r\nMax on the other hand, the man looked like he was hit with a sledgehammer, a gaping hole in his face, dripping blood and shedding bone. \r\n\r\nHe was on his way out to be sure, but Mike took no chances, he picks up the cat-like and uses it to bludgeon Max to the point of decapitation. \r\n\r\nI expect him to snap out of it, to run me through his plan, but Mike simply turns to me, I see nothing of the man I know in those eyes. \r\n\r\n“You, useless fuck, stay out of the splash zone. “ He says, sprinting out into the hallway with a sinister echoing chuckle. \r\n\r\nI open the paper, hands shaking, dull light barely enough to read the childlike scrawl. \r\n\r\n“\r\nKev, if you are reading this, shit has gotten bad. Some part of my plan fucked up, and, well, I broke. \r\n\r\nIt isn’t an act, it isn’t part of the plan, it’s what happens when I let myself get overwhelmed, when I get too fatalistic. \r\n\r\nI’m not talking some transformation, or another voice in my head. No man, this is just good old fashioned mental illness, disassociation, delusions, the works. \r\n\r\nIf I’ve got far enough, you should be able to find the device that will get you out of here. There will be a portly guy with a very nice family in the real world, he isn’t keen on me meeting, he will power it up and get you going. \r\n\r\nIf not, I’m sorry man. I’m not a hero, fuck, I’m not even a villian. I’m a guy with some serious problems who swung for the fences. “\r\n\r\nI laugh, it’s all I can do, angered Demigods all around me, my one ally mentally broken and slaughtering innocent people? This place is nothing if not a giant morbid joke at my expense. \r\n\r\nAll of you have been telling me this from the beginning, so I listen. I’ve come too far to curl up and die now. \r\n\r\nThe walk to the control room is a series of nonsensical twists and turns that should have done nothing more than taken me in circles. \r\n\r\nThe sights on the way though. \r\n\r\nThis wasn’t a fight, or settling a score, people left mortally wounded, others cut open and displayed. It felt like rampage, ritual and revenge all blended together. \r\n\r\nEvery noise makes me stop dead, I know what Mike is capable of, and after that note, I know it may get pointed in my direction. \r\n\r\nBut it isn’t Mike that finds me. The steel, keypad locked door to my freedom Sits at the end of the hallway, but between it and myself, appearing out of thin air, is Art. \r\n\r\nHe looks out of breath, hair slightly askew, demeanor just a step off of his normal arrogance. \r\n\r\n“Where is the clown? “ Art says to me, black and crimson energy starting to gather in his right hand. \r\n\r\n“Please, I had nothing to do with this… “ I start to plead, my valor having been spent. \r\n\r\n“Of course not, you don’t have the fucking balls, that God damned jester though… “ There is a noise behind us, with a flick of his wrist, Art sends the energy speeding down the narrow hallway, for the briefest of moments it illuminates a silhouette silently stalking toward us. \r\n\r\nArt sneers, another rot reeking energy bolt screams down the hallway, tearing a gauge out of one grey plaster wall, in the flash Mike’s grin glows. \r\n\r\nA click, a hum, and the office building from hell is harshly illuminated once again. \r\n\r\nThe scene is the pinnacle of the mountain of brutality I’ve had to climb. \r\n\r\nBodies, some living some not, hang from the ceiling, torn open, slashed from neck to groin, they drip a constant patter of droplets, blood falls like a biblical curse, camouflaged until now by the hazard lights. \r\n\r\nMike drops a hefty looking control box, hastily hard wired into the grid.  It makes me wonder how much time he spent setting up this fun house. \r\n\r\n“Well, I’m right here asshole, you think you thought of something no one else has managed to? By all means, let’s see it, life gets real boring after the first millennium. “ Art gives nothing more than a casual glance to the morbid display, walking toward Mike. \r\n\r\nThe brim of Mike’s hat hangs low, shadows obscuring everything but his fang like, crooked grin. \r\n\r\n“You think I came here to win a fight? Mike might have. \r\n\r\nMe? I’m just here to see how much damage I can cause. “ As  Mike reaches for his hat I see Art track his every move. \r\n\r\nThe cat flies through the air, but stops a foot from Art’s face, hovering, confused, in mid air. \r\n\r\nThe noise behind us starts to rise to alarming levels. No matter how good Mike is at causing shit, this can’t all be his doing. \r\n\r\n“Might have worked, didn’t. “ Art says simply, a shimmer of grey energy around the feline begins to constrict, at first there is nothing, the creature showing that same invulnerability from before. \r\n\r\nBut with visible concentration from Art, as the field turns almost opaque, the creature is crushed, left to fall, formless on the stain resistant carpet. \r\n\r\nI scream, the in unison look I receive from the two murderous bastards in front of me silences it. \r\n\r\nThe noise becomes too much to ignore, I look down the hallway, and off in the distance, lit in shocking detail is a mass of the denizens of the mountain. \r\n\r\nIt's a scrum, a melee, a mosh pit with lethal consequences. If there are sides to the approaching battle I can’t make them out. \r\n\r\n“So you riled up the locals and got a cat killed, great plan King Arthur. Any last words? “ Art doesn’t even move, he is simply holding Mike by his neck, screaming over the din. \r\n\r\nMike seems to have some, but his eyes are glued to the corpse of Jr. On the floor. \r\n\r\nThe mass begins to move, and boil, gaining volume, and spreading. Art chokes Mike, his other hand plucking an eye from the clown’s skull.\r\n\r\nMike’s attempts to free himself are futile, but as the rapidly shifting blob of flesh and organs launches itself at the Ceo of Purgatory, Art stumbles, falling over as one leg is engulfed. \r\n\r\nI sprint, I try not to look back, but I do anyway, I see Mike, art, and whatever the semi solid that was Junior get overrun with the denizens of the mountain. \r\n\r\nMike must have figured some things out because, as promised, when I began to slam my fists against the cold steel door, I was greeted by a portly man who placed me into a large clear cylinder before working away on keyboards of brass and bone. \r\n\r\nIt's been a year since I got out of the mountain, and while I can’t say it’s been the best year of my life ( getting used to life down a couple of fingers isn’t fun.), I can say it’s been the most free. \r\n\r\nI’m working, I’m, mostly drug free, and when I’m not, it’s fungus and Mary Jane, not coke and kibble. \r\n\r\nAnd up until last week, I didn’t hear word one about the mountain. \r\n\r\nTill the day a bunch of men, pushing seventy rolled up in the type of van father’s warn their daughters about, the outside painted like psychedelic vomit. \r\n\r\nWe had a conversation, and I’d almost decided they were full of shit, until a back window rolled down. Billows of skunk smelling smoke pouring out. \r\n\r\n“You got the balls for round 2 Kev? “ Mike says, his face a nearly skinless mess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know if I do.",

        "text": "Maybe it's because of the stormy weather we've recently had here. Maybe because I've been sleep deprived for weeks now. I'm not sure. There are things that follow you, though, and shape who you are. Whether you want them to or not.\n\nLet me start by introducing myself a little.\n\nI grew up in a small town in the northwest. I often joked about how my town felt like it was locked in time because, while I was young in the 90s and early 2000s, the architecture and technology of my town felt more like that of the 70s or 80s. \n\nOnce I had graduated High School I wanted to see a little bit of the world and as such spent a few years in South America lending humanitarian aid. After I came home, I continued my studies into Computer Engineering. Halfway through my studies, my bank account began running dangerously low so I took several semesters working across the country on the east coast, partially because of the job offer I had received and partially because I wanted to see more of the country.\n\nI've always loved the outdoors and camping, and have been to nearly every state in the U.S, many of them multiple times.\n\nSee, I've never been one to consider myself particularly 'in tune' with the supernatural, and in actuality scoffed at the notion for most of my life. But I guess if anything that is what this post is meant for; to bring into light the proceedings that made me believe, even if against my own will. It is my belief that the following stories have contributed greatly, if not wholly, to my insomniac behavior.\n\nNames and locations have been changed or withheld to respect privacy.\n\n**#1**\n\nIt was my second semester of college. Me and a few of my friends decided that we wanted to hike the tallest peak in the state, so we set aside a weekend to make the drive, camp the night at the base of the mountain, and start the hike at the crack of dawn. I say me and my friends but it was more the idea of Matt and Amy, who had started dating about four months prior. They had asked Jarom and I if we wanted to tag along, mostly (I believe) because we were from the area while they were from other states. We were happy to go; it was exciting.\n\nThe beginning of the trip was just as you might expect - lots of laughing, joking, singing to songs on the radio, you know, the kind of things everyone does on road trips. It was only a few hours away, and we pulled in as the sun was setting. The first thing I remember being out of the ordinary was that the sky was unusually red. Not the normal pink, orange, and yellow you might expect from a sunset, but bloodred. We hurried to set up the tent while the last of the light eeked around the horizon. Using flashlights we scavenged the area for wood and built a small fire to cook the food we had brought. \n\nIt was a dark night; there was no moon to grace us with its presence. Outside of the small sphere of light cast from the fire, we could see nothing. All of us had camped often, so this didn't scare us. Suddenly, though, Jarom shushed us. \"Did you guys hear that?\" he whispered. We definitely all heard it. Movement. And a lot of it. All around us the brush and dry grass was being rustled by small creatures in the dark.\n\nThe silence pressed on our ears heavy. We all held our breath until a sudden, sharp yipping broke through the cold air. Coyotes. Not uncommon in the area, and not too much of a threat to three young adults, but enough to put us on edge. Matt made some joke about it being time for bed, to which Amy quickly agreed. Me and Jarom put out the fire and just as we were about to pull out flashlights we all in unison noticed one of the most peculiar and inexplicable things I think I have ever witnessed. I don't even know how to explain it.\n\nSome of the side of the mountain that we would hike in the morning was glowing.\n\nNot like a bioluminescent glow. It was like this section of the mountain was lit up. Not by a spotlight, or any other kind of manufactured light source. The best way I can describe it is that it looked as if that part of the mountain had already made it to morning, albeit about 8 hours too early, and the rest of the world was plunged in complete blackness. We stared at it and conversed about it for around five or ten minutes, each as perplexed as the next as to where the light could possibly be coming from.\n\nAfter the shock of the phenomena wore off, we all turned away to head to the tent, which was only about fifteen feet from where we had our little fire. \"Wait, look.. the light's gone!\" Amy had said anxiously when we reached the tent. We all turned and looked and everything was pitch black. In the few seconds it took to walk back to the tent, the mountain had ceased to glow.\n\nWe all had a hard time sleeping that night as we talked about how strange it was that the light disappeared seemingly the moment none of us were looking at it anymore, and were frequently awoken throughout the night as the coyotes barked and rustled around the tent.\n\n**#2**\n\nWhen I was a young teenager I worked at a summer camp. It was my first job, and I enjoyed the experience. There were lots of weird stories of things that had happened at that camp and I wish I was in better communication with some of the people I had worked with because I know people were always having strange things happen. I'll have to see if I can get in contact with anyone I can.\n\nHowever, I have my fair share of stories.\n\nOn one evening, just as the sun was setting, I was returning from a checking on one of the further campsites. It was customary to check in with all of the campsites every night to make sure everybody had what they needed. At this point I had walked these trails so much, whether in the dark or during the day, that it was second nature. I had made it nearly all the way back to the main lodge area. Near the lodge was a lake that people could canoe and kayak in during the day. As I drew close to the lake I could hear plopping in the water. Some kid had wandered from their campsite and was throwing small stones into the lake, I thought.\n\nIt is fitting to mention that the stones were hitting the water very rhythmically. *plop*. four seconds. *plop*. four seconds. *plop*. As I rounded the corner I entered the lake area, where no one was allowed without staff members present for obvious safety reasons. I scanned the shore looking for the kid I was going to have to chasten for being away from camp after dark. No one. I looked across to the far shore, which was only accessible by boat and no one was there either. Instead, there was the silhouette of a very slim and tall person with long, bushy hair walking across the surface of the lake. Its strides were short but it moved extremely slowly, and it was walking towards me. I stared frozen in shock for what seemed like an eternity, and noted how its feet would sink into the water just a ways into the water, so that surface lapped just above where its ankles would be. It was a good ten to fifteen feet from the far shore, where the water should have been at least three or four feet deep.\n\nAs soon as I came to my senses, I noped out of that situation as fast as I could. I didn't sleep for a few days, and that night I spent in agonizing anxiety that at any moment whatever it was would hunt me down and tear through my tent and do whatever it was that it would do to me because I had witnessed it.\n\n**#3**\n\nWhen I was in South America, it was normal for us to be out late. Me and a friend, Emilio, were coming home one night and it was starting to get very late and very dark. We were in an area we didn't know as well as we probably should have, but we decided to take a road that should have connected to the road we lived on. It is important to mention as well that we didn't ever drive, we almost strictly walked wherever we went. \n\nAs we walked down this road, there were noticeably less and less streetlights. Also, strangely the road seemed longer than it should have been, like we should have reached the next road over already. We pressed on, however, even after commenting to one another about getting that weird feeling you get when something isn't quite right. \n\nEventually there were no street lights - we were going solely by moonlight at this point. The air felt colder than it should have, too. At this point I'm getting nervous, but Emilio insists we push on. We eventually come into an area with a large religious meeting house, but it's dilapidated; every window is broken, statues are missing limbs or have carvings in their faces, weird symbols and runes are etched into the outer walls, that kind of stuff. There are also about seven people in black jackets all sitting in our vicinity.\n\nSuddenly, in perfect unison, every head of every person in this spot turns and looks directly at me and Emilio in an almost robotic way. As they begin to get up from their spots on the ground and surrounding benches, Emilio murmurs \"we shouldn't be here\" and we both turn and hightail it out of there. Luckily none of those people followed us and we got back to the main road where we had taken our wrong turn. The next road down was the road we thought we had turned on, and took us straight home. \n\nThe next day while it was still light out we tried to find that road. Where we thought it should have been there was only a wall of buildings. We spent hours walking up and down the streets surrounding the area, thinking that maybe we had missed it somehow. We never found that spot again. We asked the people local to the area and no one knew what we were talking about. We checked maps and satellite images and saw no evidence of the building, which should have been easy to spot, on account of how large it was. To this day neither me nor Emilio knows what happened that night, and we tried to stay out of that area as much as we could.\n\n**#4**\n\nWhen I was living on the east coast me and a few friends lived in a large apartment building near the top of a heavily wooded hill. Who am I kidding? All of the surrounding area was heavily wooded hills. But sometimes after work we would set up our hammocks in the trees just up the hill a ways and relax. On one such occasion, we were all hanging out and laughing at ourselves because we had the idea to set up three hammocks between the same two trees, like a triple-layered bunk bed. The trees were definitely robust enough to handle the weight, and we thought it was such a dumb but hilarious idea that these three hammocks were all set up in such a way.\n\nI had to go to the bathroom, so I walked a ways into the woods to relieve myself. When I had found a suitable spot to pee, I began to take care of business. At about half a tank, I realized I could hear a faint radio static a little ways up the hill and to my left. Once I had finished, I began to walk towards the static sound. Through the static I could hear a woman's voice saying something, but couldn't make out what it was she was saying. Whatever it was was rhythmic, and followed the same cadence. As I got closer to the source, I could tell she was saying one word, over and over: Escape. Escape. Escape. Escape.\n\nI got that scary chill that you get in these situations and suddenly I realized I couldn't hear anyone or anything around me, just that one word. Was it me or was it also far darker than it should have been for the time? Suddenly I could hear footsteps and leaves rustling in front of me, so I turned and started running in the direction I thought I had come from. I popped out of the wooded area far away from where I thought I would have, but I knew where I was at, and returned quickly to my friends. They commented on how pallid I looked, so I told them everything that had just happened. For a while we were all silent there, but eventually we were able to all shake it off and return back to laughing and joking around\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I think I'll have to leave it here tonight. Revisiting this in such detail has taken its toll, and I've already had to take several breaks. I also started feeling slight vertigo and like I was bobbing up and down in my office chair a moment ago. I'll be working on trying to remember some more experiences in the meantime, and will post more as time allows.",

        "text": "My name is Donald Andrews. Donald Andrews, Ph.D., to be precise. I have always been fascinated by the supernatural world and the mysteries surrounding it. \n\nAs a physicist and chemist, I believed that if one could understand the underlying principles, the supernatural could be studied and harnessed through scientific means. For years, I was ridiculed by my peers in the scientific community for my unconventional theories. Little did they know how close I was to discovering the truth.\n\nIt all started in 1972 when I stumbled upon an old journal written by John B. Wallace, its earliest entries dating back to 1880. The journal was in tatters, but I managed to piece together the entries by date. Here are some excerpts from the journal from the year 1895.\n\n\\---x---\n\nApril 3rd, Morning:\n\n\"The wolves have not yet stopped howling. It’s been 4 days straight. The wretched creature shows no sign of relenting. It is not human, that I can be sure of. It strangled my hound yesterday. The poor creature is still yelping. How is it influencing those wild wolves? I intend to find out soon! Today I plan to poison the gutter it drinks water from. I have created an odorless compound composed of mercury - it is capable of dissolving in water. I will write down my findings in the afternoon.\"\n\nApril 3rd, Noon:\n\n\"As expected, he is dying. Even with all his uncanny abilities, it was not able to detect my compound. It is hissing and seems to be cursing me now. I have not been able to decipher its speech, but the creature is surely intelligent. It is the way the creature dresses - those golden robes, the brown leather armor and silvery boots. I bet it even knows English or some other human tongue.\n\nIt appears human, except that its ears are pointed, and it has no hair. It used to sing a sweet tune. It is capable of mesmerizing even the sanest of minds. It is only by plugging my ears that I was able to escape its godforsaken hypnotic tune.\n\nI fear that poisoning it might have taken away the properties in its blood.\"\n\nApril 5th:\n\n\"The accursed creature is truly astounding. It has a heart - a heart yes! Its blood has properties which seem out of this world. It MUST be rich in nutrients. I fed some to my hound yesterday. My hound's injured eye has fully recovered!\"\n\nApril 10th:\n\n\"I fear I have murdered a creature divine. May God have mercy on my soul! ‘Twas a messenger of God! Even in its dying breath, it told me a way to save my wife. It worked! She can walk again now.\n\nI shall now describe the recipe I used to heal her. What more arcane knowledge this creature had, I cannot fathom. But its body and belongings contain as many secrets as its mind, that I am sure of.\"\n\n\\---x---\n\nThrough hours of rumbling in John's descendents' dilapidated mansion, I had come across what might have been elf-blood.\n\nI became obsessed with the idea that this creature's blood might be the key to unlocking the supernatural world. I managed to obtain a sample of the supposed elf-blood and, using the University's electron microscope, I discovered something extraordinary. The DNA in the sample exhibited self-assembly mechanisms only intelligent entities could display. I was certain that I had found the source of so-called 'wizardry'. I believed that all 'magic' was a result of manipulating ancient technology, possibly of extraterrestrial origin; just as the modern computer revolution was a result of combining the power of thousands and millions of transistors and manipulating the electric current passing through them.\n\nIntrigued by these possibilities, I dedicated my life to uncovering the secrets of this arcane technology. It took me three decades, but I finally collected all the necessary components for a ritual that I believed would grant me immortality.\n\nAs I gathered the materials for the ritual, I faced numerous challenges and setbacks. My own children had me diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 90s, and I became a pariah among my colleagues. I spent years trying to recreate the machinery from scratch, only to fail time and time again. Eventually, I realized that attempting to fully understand the mechanisms behind this was an insurmountable task for a single person.\n\nIt was a humungous research mult-decade project which would require immense government funding and possibly hundreds of scientists, engineers and investors. Not to mention the humiliation I had faced from the scientific community either...\n\nFrustrated and impatient, I decided to focus on my initial goal: using this ancient technology to perform supernatural feats. I planned to revive the dead. The ancients considered it taboo to do so...however, I was sure that it had been attempted several times before.\n\nI started my experiments in the 90s, successfully resurrecting dead bacteria and later, larger animals. Just a few days ago, I managed to revive a dead deer that I had hunted for sport.\n\nEmboldened by my success, I decided that it was time to test my theories on a human subject. I chose my assistant, Dr. Canberra, as the first test subject. He knew too much about my experiments anyway. He would have the honor of being the first human to be revived using my newfound knowledge.\n\nIt took me decades to collect the numerous objects I required to conduct this ritual; esoteric objects and the skull of a beast long extinct. \n\n\\------\n\nJune 5th, 2007\n\nThe day of the experiment has finally arrived. I plan to kill Dr. Canberra today. Or Archie, as I call him. He *is* one of my oldest students.\n\n2 parts magnesium. 5 ounces of elf blood, 5 pounds of troll skin, 3 liters of sulphuric acid…, yes; I am ready. \n\n“Goodbye Archie! You were a good assistant…”, I said. He stared at me; his eyes filled with terror, like a dog trapped in a cage. Well, he is **literally** trapped in a cage, after all.\n\nDr. Canberra shrieked in agony as the machine sucked his soul. I then took my rifle and shot Canberra’s lifeless body in the head 3 times and twice in the heart.\n\nI transferred his consciousness into an artificial chamber made from exotic elements, elements unknown to any modern scientist. I then bound the consciousness back to his lifeless, destroyed body.\n\nTo my horror, the resurrection went awry. Dr. Canberra's body went into a grotesque dance, and his organs fell out as he tried to escape the cage. Realizing the process was too much for him, I activated my plasma incinerator, completely annihilating his body and disintegrating it at the particulate level. Large parts of my lab caught fire too. What was I thinking, having him only 50 feet away from me? I should have developed a sealed incineration chamber before-hand. Good to keep this in mind for the next time!\n\nDespite the failure of my first human experiment, I remain determined to achieve my ultimate goal: immortality and unfathomable power through this ancient technology I have spent my life studying...I must find a new test subject soon…",

I’m not exactly a prolific reader, and the Veilbreaking book was melting my brain. My new compadre made more sense of it than me. He really digs this occult shit.\n\nI guess I’ve mainly talked about *how* I came back to life, rather than *why*. Yes, I think we all know that Billy Riley wanted to clear his name by proving that he never killed me. I guess he never counted on becoming a soulless, flesh-eating demon in the process.\n\nBut there was more to it than that.\n\nJohn wanted to delve deeper into Billy’s motives, so we did some online research on our town’s history. Turns out Billy spent a chunk of time in prison for vehicular manslaughter, swerving a premeditated murder charge — the slippery sicko. He was released after serving a twenty-year sentence.\n\n“Look at this,” John said, pointing at his computer monitor. “It’s a post on the town’s private Facebook page — don’t ask why I’m sad enough to follow that.”\n\n“Is Facebook the webbed-page with five-second music videos?” I asked.\n\n“There’s… Just stop trying to understand the internet,” John said. “New evidence came to light in 2020, and Billy Riley was convicted of murder, not manslaughter. Your friends and family sought justice for you, by the looks of it. But Billy Riley’s been missing since the call for his arrest.”\n\nI sighed. “So, he resurrected me to remain a free man.”\n\nJohn nodded. “With regards to *how* he achieved that… I read the Veilbreaking book from front to back. Here’s what I’ve deduced: Billy Riley made a deal with an unearthly entity called Det, which brought you back from the dead. But Billy had to fulfil his side of the bargain — Det requires people’s souls.”\n\n“Jesus,” I shuddered. “We probably should’ve discussed this *after* I’d finished my lunch. What did you say you did to the grub? Hair-fried it?”\n\nJohn laughed. “I used an *air* fryer. Welcome to 2023. I’m sorry we don’t have the hoverboards from Back to the Future II.”\n\nI gasped. “Wait… They made a *second* Back to the Future? Dude, I loved the first film. I… Billy robbed me of a full life.”\n\n“We’re getting sidetracked,” John said.\n\nI nodded. “Sorry… Nerves make me talk a lot. What’s the plan?”\n\nJohn paused, before frowning. “You described Billy as physically *hollow*, and that worries me... I read about those who serve Det for too long. Lifeless husks who can only consume flesh, not souls. Ron, I think Billy’s too far gone.”\n\nMy friend paused, and I trembled at the prospect of my doomed soul.\n\n“There’s only one way we could possibly save you, and it’s a long shot. We need to sever Billy’s connection to Det,” John said. “Then we pray that the unholy thing returns your soul to the realm beyond the veil.”\n\n“Shit,” I whispered. “You’re a good dude, John. Thank you for helping me.”\n\n“Thank me when this is over,” He said.\n\nMy friend drove us to the local park, armed with nothing but the Veilbreaking book and good intentions. A store-bought pig’s liver festered on the backseat.\n\n“The book said that should weaken him,” John explained. “Only in a dulled state can his powers be returned to Det.”\n\nWe waited at a picnic table and watched the park slowly empty. A stillness in the air weighed heavily on my shoulders. As the sun set, silence consumed us. Billy was watching. I could feel terrible black eyes drilling into my skull.\n\n“He’s here,” I gasped.\n\nA horrifying creak confirmed my instinct, as two abnormal, abominable hands appeared from the darkness, clutching the bench on which I sat. Beneath the wooden table, beady black eyes inexplicably glistened garishly. John and I jumped up, shrieking in animalistic terror.\n\nThe woodwork of the table splintered and snapped, revealing the deformed shadow that used to be Billy. He was taller than before. He, or it, turned to John, who was clutching the pig’s liver, and lunged. I screeched as my friend sacrificed his arms to Billy’s predatory teeth.\n\nJohn produced an inhuman, agonising sound, but Billy quickly recoiled, realising that he had ingested something sinister. Free of the entity’s carnivorous canines, John collapsed onto the picnic table, clutching the stumps that used to sport hands.\n\n“He’s been weakened, Ron!” John woozily cried.\n\nLips twitching in horror, I called out. “I bring you the Veilbreaker, Det! Please, save my soul.”\n\nBefore our eyes, we watched Billy convulse, mouth agape, as the blackness within his eyes seemed to escape. His body shrank and crumpled, reducing him to a foetal ball in the grass. Writhing on the floor was no more than a man — the blackness hadn’t left his heart, of course, but he was human. Just a devious, dastardly dickhead.\n\nBilly shivered on the grass. “What… What have you done?”\n\n“It’s over,” John said. “Come the second hour, Det will save Ron’s soul.”\n\nThat brings us to the current moment.\n\nIt’s been a tubular ride, my futuristic readers, but I think I’m finally getting out of here. Back to the world beyond the veil. John’s going to take Billy to the police station when I’m gone. I’ll ask him to finish my story. I wish he’d been around back in my day. I think he totally would’ve loved the ‘80s.\n\nI’m not gonna miss 2023, but I’ll admit that it wasn’t all bad. Air fryers are rad.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "Apple Newton Chapter 1: Happy Apple Farm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing my age you got the privilege to see the earliest days of the video game industry evolve into what they are now. Yes, I'm a bit of an old fart. I was born in 1975 so I was 10 years old when the original Super Mario Bros. came out on the NES. It was my first console and we got the Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt bundle. From there I collected other such games. Contra, Dr. Mario, Friday the 13th and so much more. I was a teenager when the Super Nintendo was released and have had just as many fond memories with it as well. Discovering the Top Secret Area and how to beat Super Mario World without even completing world 2 made me feel like a total genius.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs time went on I still collected video games. PlayStation, Xbox, Wii, PS4 and the Switch were only just a few to name. It was amazing seeing video games evolve. Going from 2 bits to 8 bits and 16 bits. Then breaking into the 3rd dimension with simple polygons and now being able to replicate reality to the closest it's ever been. And don't even get me started on Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I can't deny that the classics always drew me back in. It may be just nostalgia but I'm not a big fan of many modern games. Live service games feel like too much of a commitment and I was more of a fan of action rather than the slow cinematics that have become so popular. Thankfully the indie scene does help me scratch that itch with some retro inspired titles. Super Meat Boy, Shovel Knight, Pizza Tower and Freedom Planet send me back in a fresh new way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI occasionally like to go to retro game stores to see if there are any classics I may have missed out on. But it really seems like all that's like is standard sports titles. Most of which I already own. And the ones that weren't were way too expensive for me to even consider grabbing. Sometimes retro game stores love to rank up prices either based on the popularity of franchises or if a popular YouTuber reviewed a game they just so happen to have. Trust me the second is way more common than you'd like to think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully antique stores can sometimes have retro games. Even if the quality and quantity may be smaller they are at least far cheaper than most retro game stores. So even if they don't work I'm not losing as much as I would with an overpriced retro game store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy collection is still ever growing to this day. Think like the set of Angry Video Game Nerd but split in half. Just look at my NES collection. Super Mario Bros. 3, Jaws, Ghostbusters 2, Donkey Kong collection, Castlevania and...hello? What is this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI may be almost 50 but you'd think I'd remember getting a game like this. It was near the beginning of my collection as I put everything in alphabetical order. It was an NES game with a white side label that had the words Apple Newton written in sharpie. I pulled the game out and the front cover was the same. I thought maybe someone had covered the real game with a blank piece of paper but no, this label was glued on like the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had never heard of a game called Apple Newton before. So I decided to do a quick Google search. The only things I could find were a discontinued PDA from Apple called the Newton, a PBS show called \"Newton's Apple\" that ran from the 80's to the late 90's and a mid-2000's board game called Newton's Apple Gravity Strategy Game. I thought maybe this was some licensed game based on the PBS show and someone had mistaken the title as Apple Newton.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout anything better to do I decided to try this one out. My childhood NES was barely working any more so I decided to pull out the Retron 3. It was this unofficial console that was able to play NES, SNES and SEGA Genesis cartridges. All I had to do was put the game in the right slot and turn the lower nob to NES. It took me a few tries to get the game working but after cleaning the game with a cotton swab I was able to finally get it on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe title screen was very standard for an NES title. The logo was blocky in the color red with a green shadow. And yes, it did indeed read Apple Newton. So it wasn't a typo. But now it made me even more curious. What was this game all about? There were two options on screen. Start Game and Password that were able to be selected by a cursor that was shaped like a leaf. Oh, how cute. Of course, this was one of the games that made you use the select button to navigate the menu. There was no information on this game online so I had to press Start Game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game seemed pretty competent. It even had cutscenes similar to what you'd see in games like Ninja Gaiden. But unlike Tecmo's classic, these were only still images. There was no text or any fade in, the images just popped back and forth. Kind of lazy but still presentable enough. Maybe I got my hands on a game that was a game that was never completed. Perhaps this was an early version used for testing before whatever company produced this title had canceled it. Cancelling games that are near completion wasn't uncommon. Thrill Kill, Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke And Mirrors and Starfox 2 were such games that also were completed but never released. Well, Starfox 2 did on the Switch's online service. But I guess that will only be the case until that service shuts down. Then it's back to being lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm getting side tracked here. The cutscenes showed an apple falling from a tree. The second shot shows this apple growing limbs and a face after bouncing off the ground. They looked ecstatic to be alive with a huge open smile and all of his limbs pointed outward to a celebratory pose. The last shot sees them running to the distance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the game finally starts. The text \"Happy Apple Farm\" came on screen. The level is loaded and Apple Newton runs from the side of the screen and stops to do a pose with a quick jingle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe level looks like a giant farm land with numerous trees all with apples in them. The perspective seems to be as if Newton is the size of a real apple as everything around him was huge. And the world seemed huge too as in the distance I would see the silhouette of a mountain. I moved them to the right where I could see a wooden sign take up most of the screen. The sign was telling me how to control Apple Newton. The controls were as so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Press left and right on the D-Pad to move.\n\n\\-Press down to crouch\n\n\\-Press A to jump\n\n\\-Press B to open to mouth\n\n\\-Press B again to release held object\n\n\\-Hold B while moving to run\n\n\\-Press down while running to roll\n\n\\-Press down in the air to do a ground pound\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty complex for an NES platformer honestly. I don't remember that many games from this era having a ground pound or a roll. Sure there was Kirby after he got the wheel ability. But it really wasn't as common as it is now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tested out all of their abilities and moved forward. I wasn't sure what the \"open mouth\" ability was for until I saw a large seed. I decided to use this ability on it and Apple Newton put the scene in his mouth. This made him double in size and despite how awkward it looked for him to move he was still able to use all of his abilities just fine. All that was different was his size and both his running speed and jumping height were slightly reduced. But his ground pound and roll seemed to be even stronger than before. An enemy was approaching me. A banana with cartoonish sharp teeth. Pressing the B button again caused the seed to shoot out and kill the banana. He flickered away like most game enemies would but the seed still remained. It seems like they designed this game around both sizes of Apple Newton and the seed. It makes me wonder how successful this game would've been if it did release.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI faced a few other enemies like a rolling orange with one eye on its side. Speaking of Kirby's wheel ability, it did bear a striking resemblance to Wheelie from Kirby's Adventure with an orange color instead of black. It almost looked like they just got the same sprite and recolored it. Maybe it was a placeholder? The second enemy was a grape with a simple angry expression. It would bounce around the stage towards me and even change direction if I were to pass it. Most of these enemies were easily killed by jumping on them. But using the seed was much easier. Especially against the bananas as if I were to jump on them I would stick to it while performing a slipping motion. Sliding uncontrollably in the direction I was facing. I could still jump but I kept the momentum and still took a hit of damage. I could see speedrunners doing some fun things with this game. Don't worry about the damage though. There was a meter on the top right of the screen. The more I progressed through the stage and the more enemies I'd kill the more the meter would fill. Once completely filled the screen would freeze and flash for a short bit as it would regenerate one hit I may have lost. That's actually a really cool system. I tried moving backwards through the stage but the meter wouldn't budge. So it would only fill if I continued through the stage. I had never seen a game do that before. Also this game seems to be generous with its health because I had a total of 5 hits I could take before dying. There was the number 15 under my health bar. Wow, that's a lot of lives to start with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight at the end of the stage was a new sprite. It seemed like the banana enemy but laying down, motionless. It looked to be almost completely brown. I wasn't sure what this was but jumping on them caused the same effect as jumping on the moving bananas. So I suppose this was like a bear trap variation of the moving banana.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter beating the first stage I was brought to a map and given a password to come back to this stage when needed. The password was B ! r + H. The map moved horizontally with numbers over each stage counting upward. There seemed to be 4 stages per world. Most of the stages used the same enemies and patterns. Well, there was one stage where I was climbing the inside of a tree. The background would move giving the impression that I was rotating around the inside of the tree. You could see holes that I guess were supposed to show the outside but instead of the blue sky it was completely black. I guess they didn't complete this visual in time. As I progressed through these stages the grape enemies became more and more common. Along with these new raisin variations. They slouched over and only walked across the stage. Much like a Goomba in most Mario games. These were easier to deal with than the regular Grapes. I thought it was done with the variations but then came the new version of the orange. It looked deflated and its eyes gave an angry look. At least I think it was angry. The position of the eyebrow made it difficult to tell. It seemed to move like the raisin but instead of moving forward it would pace back and forth. Occasionally gaining speed as it would squint while doing so but it would always slow back down. Still harder to deal with in comparison to the grapes though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got to the 4th stage I was brought to the boss. So I suppose each world has 3 levels and a boss. The boss was a batch of grapes all connected to a green tree-like formation. All of them have the same angry expressions as their brethren. Then a text box would rise from the bottom of the screen showing white text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"That's it! We're gonna hurt you a BUNCH!\" The word bunch was capitalized by the way. I lifted an eyebrow and made a sarcastic chuckle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow this boss would play is that each grape would shoot itself out in a straight horizontal line and boomerang back to its spot. It kind of reminded me of the Yellow Devil boss from Mega Man. Man, I really gotta stop comparing this game to others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could only hurt them when they were disconnected from the roots. So one by one I defeated all of the grapes. Except for the one on top. They did nothing but stare at me. Then, all of a sudden the game flashed like I had just filled the level progress meter. But it wasn't full. Not only this but instead of gaining health, I lost some instead. I lost one hit from my health bar. And I don't mean that it caused me damage. I mean that as in my healthbars max went from 5 to 4. Then the number under it had changed to 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I noticed the boss's appearance had changed. He instead looked sad and there was a bit more detail in his face. A few more pixels that I have no idea what they were supposed to mean? Apple Newton also got that same detail around his eyes as well. And his eyes looked a tiny bit smaller.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe text box rose from the bottom of the screen again. It read \"Do you remember that?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 2: Full Carton City\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReturning to the world map I was allowed to move on to the next area. Full Carton City. This presented itself as a massive city. But the buildings had round tops instead of squares. The password for this world was @ q i # g. I went into the first stage where I was immediately confronted by a new character. An Egg that looked like an old woman. A text box rose from below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh my Yolks! Bandits have stolen my truck! It was filled with all sorts of ingredients. Without it how will I continue my business? What? You'll chase after those expired ones? Thank you! I'll be sure to bake you my specialty as a reward. Pumpkin pie!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen went to black and now I'm on the stage. Apple Newton was walking in the middle of the street as stopped vehicles in a traffic jam were the platforms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's strange was that Apple Newton's appearance was just like how it was after beating the grape bunch. Smaller eyes and extra detail. And my health was still reduced to 4 hits and the mysterious number under it was still 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now there were changes in gameplay. Now there was a sprint meter. In the first world I was able to run for as long as I liked. But now I can only run for as long as the meter would allow. But still it seemed to be generous with how much sprint it gave me and it recharges rather quickly. All I had to do to recharge it was stop sprinting. I would run and jump and it would still charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first enemy and most likely the cause of this traffic jam presented itself. An egg in a robber's outfit. The only thing you could see were his eyes and mouth. His limbs were black lines. Perhaps a style choice or an unfinished sprite sheet?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were a few variations of the bandits. Some had guns, others had shields and guns while there were also a few that relied on brute force as they would try to hit me with punches and dives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the bandits that had a shield and gun I couldn't use the seed on them so I had to jump upon their heads instead. But this is when I realized that Apple Newton's jump was also reduced in height. Perhaps I was simply imagining things as these were the largest enemies I have encountered yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was moving across the stage, jumping over trucks and convertibles all while fighting bandits, when I got careless and allowed myself to be shot by one of them. The screen flashed white for a moment and when I returned everything was gone. All of the bandits, all of the vehicles and all of the people were no more. The background changed as well. Windows were broken, doors were boarded up, litter was everywhere and while I had said that all of the cars disappeared there still seemed to be a few in the background. They too were abandoned as their hoods would be bent and their windows shattered. All of the music was absent. This city turned into a ghost town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I could do was walk forward. This was easier said than done considering that my run was now limited but I pushed on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was beginning to wonder what this game's deal was. What was it trying to convey? This must've been some really ambitious project before it got scrapped. Makes me wish it was released to the public.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn my walk the buildings began to crumble more and more. Vegetation began to take over and eventually all signs of city life were gone and what was left were just a few broken relics completely covered up by nature. It was at this point when Newton stopped in his tracks. I didn't tell him to do that and none of my inputs would work. He just stood there for a few moments. Then the screen flashed white again and I was back at the world map. The first stage was complete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still don't know what happened back there. I definitely wasn't a glitch as if it was the location I'd be sent to would either reuse assets like Minus World in Super Mario Bros. or be a mess of visuals as the game would soon crash afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was clearly by design. Perhaps the devs had a story to tell. Most games would make their goal obvious from the beginning but I guess this one is taking a different approach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second level took me to...oh god, of course. A sewer level. For those who don't know sewer levels were a common trope in many NES games. Batman, Mega Man 4, TMNT and the entirety of Mario Bros. all had sewer levels. Some were good but some were bad. It was a hit or miss but still an annoying trope nonetheless. The most you'd ever see these days is a sewer in some horror game or a modern Ninja Turtles title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite this, seeing the sewers made me a bit nostalgic. Even though they were an overused trope they still symbolized the NES to some capacity. I guess the saying is true, you don't know what you have until it's gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bandits were more active in this stage but it was easier to avoid them as the sewers had far less obstacles to deal with minus the occasional gaps of water I had to jump over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were some bandits driving jet skis in the water in the foreground. The splash would cause damage if it were to hit Newton but there was no way to kill them so they seemed to be the only real obstacle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the stage I saw a track with egg bandits trying to empty it. When they noticed me they attacked but I was already used to dealing with them at this point. More eggs would jump out of the truck to attack but when I beat the last one the truck began to drive off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third stage took me to the rooftops. Well, sort of. Like I said the buildings had round tops so what I was walking on was the rim that separated the round stop from the square bottom of the rest of the building. I guess I was chasing after the truck from up high. There was no music and the sky was a gloomy grey and a dark silhouette of a mountain could be seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few bombs would be thrown my way and some bandits climbed up to face Newton but this was the worst the level had to offer. As I would continue through the stage I swore I could've seen something in the sky. A white line perhaps? It was only there for a fraction of a second so I could pass it as some graphical glitch or even my imagination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the stage went on there were less eggs climbing up and soon the bombs became absent. And now I know it wasn't my imagination as more white lines would slowly start climbing up the screen into the grey sky. At this point there were no more egg bandits chasing me and the stage was just as empty as the city before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen just when I thought the stage was over I saw a new face. This one was also an egg but it wasn't wearing the burglar outfit but it also wasn't the old lady I met at the beginning of the world. They weren't wearing anything and also had the same extra detail as Apple Newton had gained. He was looking around confused. He didn't seem to know where he was or what he was doing. When I was on the same platform as him he didn't seem to notice or even care. It was almost as if I didn't exist to him. Walking into him wouldn't cause any damage either. But I could still jump on him. This was the only character like this throughout the entire stage as it ended soon after. I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to be feeling right now. So I kept playing hoping to find some kind of answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now we're at the boss. I was in front of a bakery called \"Aunt Egg's Sweet Treats\" So that was the old lady I had met earlier. The sign would show a larger graphic of Aunt Egg holding a plate with the logo inside. The truck was being driven by another egg with a curly mustache. The text box rose up once more. \"Nyehehe! Now I will finally figure out Aunt Egg's secret! You won't SCRAMBLE my plans!\" Ok, he was dying just for that joke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe would continuously try to run me over but thanks to the additional platform in the center of the stage I was able to jump over. I was a bit confused on how I would defeat this guy until I got frustrated and spat my seed into his windshield. This caused him to get out and yell at me. This was the only time I could actually damage him. All I had to do was wait until he stopped, destroy his windshield and jump on his head while he's shouting at me. I repeated this up to 5 times and the truck broke down. Just like most other games, a few explosion effects covered the trucks until the tires popped off and jumped out of the destroyed vehicle and got on his hands and knees pleading for mercy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut before anything else could've happened the screen flashes white once more and now the scene has changed. I lost another point of health. Now I'm down to 3 and the number with an unknown purpose now read 45. Apple Newton lost his cheery demeanor and now looked tired with even more detail in his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe egg boss was standing in front of me. He too had an extra amount of detail on his face but his mustache was lighter in color and he was standing with a cane. Aunt Egg's Sweet Treats was completely abandoned. The sign was covered in grime and the door was boarded up shut. A text box appeared that read \"They used to taste so good. I never figured out her secret.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 3: Frozen Good Health\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally figured out what was happening to Apple Newton. He was getting older. Those details on his face were wrinkles. I'm assuming that's what that number under his health bar represents. It's his age. He was now 45 years old. Almost as old as me. This might also be why his health was going down and why he needed a sprint meter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure how to feel about all of this. It's getting a little too real for me honestly. It was making me a little depressed. I can relate to Newton as now my body isn't what it used to be. And just like Aunt Egg's Sweet Treats I too missed some closed down establishments I used to enjoy. The local arcade that's now an insurance company, the Blockbuster that's now a Dunkin Donuts and how my local mall is living on its last legs with barely a few stores left. A Spencers, Bed Bath and Beyond and an antique store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps this is what the devs were trying to convey as they were probably going through the same thing as well. I had never seen a game back then tell a story like this. Some modern titles yes but not any on the NES. It was either save the princess, stop the alien invasion or save the world. Not face the existential dread of aging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to keep playing. Just because I wanted to hope that there was some kind of happy ending. A light at the end of the tunnel. something to salvage this depression adventure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe new password was D y ! n q. The world I was in now was called Frozen Good Health. Now we're at our ice level. A cliché that still persists to this day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNewton was in a snow covered forest at night time. The stars up above blinked in and out every now and then and the soundtrack attempted to have a jolly feel to it. As jolly as the NES's soundchip would allow anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could take my first step a polar bear jumped out at me. This polar bear was covered in chocolate syrup, had a banana on its back topped with a scoop of strawberry ice cream, sprinkles and a cherry. But obviously they had some issues with the colors due to the NES's color limitation. For those who don't know, an NES sprite had a limit of 4 colors. So the cherry was the same color as the strawberry ice cream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis beast charged at me and I instinctively jumped over. I had just barely graved over the bear as I had noticed that my jump was reduced again. It also seemed like Newton would freeze as soon as he landed. As if he had to take in the impact of his own jump. Anyone remember that country song with the lyric \"When your legs don't work like they used to before?\" Those who do may understand what Apple Newton could be going through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to summon and hold my seed but as soon as I inhaled it the screen flash white for one moment as the sound that plays when taking damage played but was drawn out and louder than ever before. Apple Newton was standing by himself in a black void as his cheek was torn wide open. The large seed was sitting beside him as he had a shocked expression on his face. His pupils were small and his eyes were almost as wide as they were when the game started. And a greenish liquid was oozing from him as he was standing in a puddle of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen froze as the tone you would hear when an NES game crashes played through my Television. I was afraid that my time with this game was over. I was conflicted on how I should feel about it. Should I take this as a sign to leave before I get even more depressed or try again to see if there is some sort of happy ending? I reset the console and put in the password.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut instead of spawning in the first stage I moved on to the second. I was in a hospital as a chocolate bar nurse was staring at Apple. He stood up and he was wrapped from head to toe with bandages. I guess he couldn't see because his input was reversed. What was worse was that my health was reduced again to 2 hits. I didn't even get to really utilize the 3 hits before that happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the nurse saw this she ran towards me and as soon as she touched me the screen reset. There was no death animation, no level name coming on screen again, the screen just flashed and I was back in bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to avoid the nurses by either jumping over them or avoid their gaze if possible. While navigating the hospital I went by multiple large doorways. These doors were massive so I was able to see the entire room they represented. I saw some familiar faces in each one. First the banana, it was the brown version from the end of the first stage. Then the raisin, then the droopy orange and the stem of the grape bunch. But the head was still by himself and now he appeared as a raisin himself. I understand now. These other variations were simply the same characters just feeling the effects of aging. Like Newton was. Like I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed a flight of stairs and went down to the next level. There I was moving to the left instead, still avoiding ice cream cone nurses and gumdrop doctors. On this floor I saw the characters of the second world. First the egg bandit, it was the same confused one I saw on the rooftops of Full Carton City. He still looked confused and scared, looking back and forth as if he didn't know where he was. I saw a few other eggs and the boss too. He was in terrible condition, his mustache was much smaller and lighter in color and he himself seemed a bit discolored as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last room shocked me the most. It was Aunt Egg but I couldn't see her face as her blanket was put over her body but I knew it was her because a pumpkin pie was left by her bed. She was dead. And just to act as a conformation a white sphere left her body and flew upwards outside of the screen. She lived her life but came to the end like all of these other characters are about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went down the last flight of stares and went through one last hoard of doctors and nurses. As soon as I went through the exit on the right the screen black and white text came on the screen. \"Please, You've done so much. let us remember you for the hero you were.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen faded back in and I was outside. Apple Newton's seed was sitting on the ground near the building. I couldn't open my mouth to inhale it so I had no choice but to leave it behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStage 3. Apple couldn't see where he was going so when he stood on an ice platform it began to slide down hill. I didn't have to move that much. All I had to do was jump at the right time to avoid one coming debris and to move from one sliding platform to the other if one began to sink too far into the snow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a hectic stage that changed the tone for a bit but it was short lived. The stages seem to be getting shorter and shorter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was at the boss stage and I wasn't sure how this was going to go since I had no way to defend myself. The polar bear had returned but he appeared to be skeletally thin. The banana on his back had turned to mush, the strawberry ice cream scoop melted and is now mixing with the chocolate syrup and the cherry on top was gone. He slowly crawled towards me and no matter what I did Apple Newton wouldn't move. The monster inched closer and closer but it never was able to reach Newton as the screen flashed again and what was left behind was the skeleton of the monster covered in pink and brown melting bits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun was rising, turning the sky into a purplish color with an orange light in the distant horizon. But the light was obscured by the mountain I kept seeing in the background, The orange light would almost appear as an outline for it. I was closer than ever before to it. My health was now reduced to 1 single hit and the number under it, Apple Newton's age, was now 60.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen faded to black and I was brought to the final world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 4: Finished Plate Plains\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I entered the world map for the final world the bridge the connected itself to the worlds prior had disappeared. I was at the end game I was hoping that there would be something that would at least bring my mood up at the end. But what I saw next would do the exact opposite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world I was in was called the Finished Plate Plains. It was a great world full of white dots and spheres that would rise upward. Each varied in size and if they rose far enough they would pick up speed and become a white line that would fly into the grey sky. Just like what I saw in Full Carton City. The music was this slow beat that would stay on any consistent rhythm. I would be fast at one point, slow the next and try to speed up only to fall back down in tempo. It was a line an AI was trying to make a theme but it was never told what the tone should be. The password is 3 n D N g. There was only 1 level in this world. On a single dot that would be in front of the mountain. The same mountain I kept seeing throughout almost every stage as a backdrop. And now I was finally about to climb it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI entered the stage and the state that Apple Newton was in was shocking. His body looked as if it had deflated. The extra detail one his face were now black lines that wrapped all around his body and even connected to his eyes and mouth which too were black as he gave off a sad tired expression. On the left side of his head where his cheek exploded was a large black line that almost appeared as the root of the decay. He was almost no more. The sprint meter was completely gone as he could no longer run or jump, his walking speed was reduced to a snail's pace and all of his abilities were unusable. Time was not so kind to Newton.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first stage was a long grey wasteland with almost nothing for miles. There were pits that led to darkness but as my jumping was disabled I could only go over them by walking on the platforms that moved left and right over top of them. I suppose the theme of this stage was timing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I could do was walk and wait for platforms to take me to the next part of the stage. There were platforms rotating in circles, some that would act as temporary walls as they moved vertically and ones that would fall if I didn't walk off them fast enough. At first the plain was flat but then the platforms would begin to help me up the mountain. There was a white and gold platform with gems all around it. It was being held up with 2 black lines. One on each side as it would be connected to a diagonal line that went up the mountain. It was like some royal Gondola lift. I stepped on the platform as it began its ascend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I scaled up the mountain further and further Apple Newton's age had changed again. He was now 70 years old But I could not tell if his appearance had changed as he was facing away from the screen. And I could see certain familiar structures in the distance as silhouettes like how I saw the mountain from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst I was a large tree and a farm house representing the Happy Apple Farm. Except now the tree was dead and the farm house building was boarded up. It was leaning to the side as the roof was caving in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I noticed something on the mountain. strange structures that would pass by the lift. Gravestones. Each one had a grey sprite of a character I encountered throughout my journey, all of which were in their prime. Their names would also appear on screen telling me that this was the ending of my adventure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBanana Slips, Grape Goons, Orange Peelers and The Ghastly Grape Bunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen faded. Age 80. I saw the next location. Full Carton City. It appeared like the post apocalyptic version I was walking through when the game changed on me after getting shot by one of the egg grunts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAunt Egg, Egg Bandit, Egg Blaster, Egg Barrier, Jet Ski Egg and Johnny \"Hard Boiled\" Yolkini.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 90. I knew what place was coming next. Frozen Good Health. But it didn't appear as I expected it to. It was still standing and the yellow squares throughout told me that they were still in business. But something was different about it now. It didn't seem to be a hospital any more as it had the word Hero's Museum written on it with blocky pixelated text. And next to it was a tall tree that was larger than the building itself. The tree itself looked nothing like the pine trees in the forest but instead a tree similar to what was at the Happy Apple Farm. I can't say for sure but if I had to guess it would seem as though that tree was at the same spot as where I left my seed after leaving the hospital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe graves were of the nurses and doctors whose names were Cocoa Bar Nurse, Mrs. Neopolitan and Dr. Small Drop. Even the polar bear had his own grave; Sunday Surprise Attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe music at this point changed. It seemed like it finally decided on what it had wanted to be. It was a slow theme that felt a bit sad but something about it seemed hopeful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lift finally made it to the top of the mountain. There all of the 3 worlds could be seen in the distance and more as well. Some I never got the chance to explore. Perhaps they were built later in Newton's life as they did seem more populated than where he was from. Apple Newton was now 100 years old and he was still facing away from me. I was no longer in control of him as he walked slowly to the center of the mountain. There he stood, taking in everything. I could not tell how he felt as I still couldn't see his face. After a while he had collapsed and there he laid as a white sphere left his body and rose up with the rest. I waited for the screen to fade but it never did. After a few minutes of taking everything myself and waiting for something else to happen I finally decided to turn off the console.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days have passed and as silly as it sounds I think the game really changed me. Something about that experience stuck with me. It made me appreciate the life I had. Sure, I may be old and my body doesn't work as well as it once did but I'm still alive. And I may be for many years to come. I used to be existential in the end. Fearing my own age and dreading the changes in my body but now I think I have learned to embrace them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe may all die one day as most of us will at least grow old. But that doesn't mean we can't enjoy the time we have and do something with ourselves. To make an impact on the world that may even remain after we pass on. Many may say that there is no point because of how insignificant we are. But it's not about defying significance. Significance doesn't care about us and time despises us. So why should we care what they think when we could be enjoying what we have now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still keep the cartridge in my collection but I haven't played it again since that day. I might one day get footage of it to show everyone else. But that's when I learn how to use capture cards and when I feel like going through Newton's life again. Thank you, Apple Newton.",

        "text": "[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11rhnu3/i_challenged_myself_to_ride_the_tram_for_an/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter last night’s encounter with the group of thugs, I was quite shaken. I didn’t know, however, what day three would hold in store for me...\n\nI still kept to my people watching, and I still made up stories about my few lonely companions during the quieter hours, but not in an overly obvious and annoying fashion.\n\nThat’s how I came to notice a certain woman. She was middle-aged, wore a long skirt and a blue woolen sweater, and kept her hair tied in a ponytail.\n\nAt first glance, there was nothing wrong with her or her behavior. She was just another normal passenger, getting on the tram at point A and getting off at point B.\n\nThings turned strange, however, when I noticed her entering the tram again at a later station further along the line.\n\nAt first I thought I was mistaken, and my eyes were playing tricks on me. This was a big city. Many people lived here, and I was sure some of them looked similar.\n\nYet as I watched her, I noticed the same skirt, the same sweater, and even the pony tail. No, this was, without a doubt, the same person.\n\nThis was impossible. How in the hell had she got here within ten minutes, a good kilometer from where she’d gotten off?\n\nI couldn’t help but shiver, as I watched her getting off again a few stations later, and felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up when she reentered the tram yet again, after a good fifteen.\n\nIn total, she entered the tram on seven entirely different locations throughout the city in about an hour and a half.\n\nShe was, however, not the only one. There were others like her, almost a dozen in total.\n\nOne was an older man, about fifty years of age. He wore a suit, carried a briefcase, and I saw him a total of five times.\n\nSome were children, just laughing children who entered the tram on their own, then left it, and then entered it again a few stations later.\n\nThey only ever appeared when the tram was empty or almost empty, at least that’s when I caught sight of them. Whenever I did, however, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Yet they did nothing strange, never looked at me or even approached me. They just rode the tram.\n\nAt one point, my eyes met those of an older woman during her fourth ‘iteration,’ as I came to call it, but she didn’t even bat an eye, and gave me no attention at all.\n\nStill, this was one of the most unsettling things I’d noticed so far, and I tried my best to stay clear of these people.\n\nAnother strange passenger was a young man, dressed entirely in black.\n\nI first noticed him in the early evening hours. He entered the tram and stayed on it, just like I did. For long hours, he just sat there, in the same seat.\n\nAt times, he stared outside, but at others, he watched the people around him, and occasionally, I even found him staring my way. When he did, an unexplainable wave of fear washed over me, and I couldn’t help but squirm in my seat. He gave me the feeling of being a trapped animal, of being prey.\n\nThe reason was his face. He wasn’t merely staring, but grinning, always grinning a comically wide grin that almost divided his face. He wasn’t grinning at anyone, however. Instead, he seemed just to grin to himself. It was the strangest thing.\n\nAt one point, I watched as he leaned forward, pushing his face so close to the woman sitting next to him, it almost touched hers.\n\nI noticed how uncomfortable she was, but she never spoke up. She just sat there, squirming in her seat nervously, almost as if she didn’t see the guy.\n\nShe was, however, far from his only victim. He did the same to countless other passengers, and none of them called him out on his behavior.\n\nThe longer this went on, the longer I watched what he was doing, the more often I found him staring at me.\n\nAs much as I told myself to ignore him, to not attract attention; I just couldn’t. I was driven by the strangest sense of curiosity. This guy, whoever he was , or... whatever he was, he was just wrong.\n\nIt was shortly past midnight when I noticed the change. For the first time, the guy wasn’t grinning to himself anymore. No, now he was grinning right at me. I saw how he leaned forward in his seat, his hands on his seat, as if he was about to push himself upward at any moment.\n\nI tried my best to stare outside, to ignore him, but whenever I took a sideway glance, he was still there, still grinning at me and each time, his grin seemed to have grown wider.\n\nEventually, when I couldn’t take it anymore, I was about to get up, to leave my trusty row of seats behind and flee to the back of the tram. Then I stopped. The strangest of feelings washed over me, one that told me I should stay right where I was. Somehow, I knew that if I were to get up right now, he’d get me.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, but I knew. I saw the anticipation on his face, the way his feet shuffled over the ground and his posture, ready to pounce on me the moment I’d get up.\n\nFinally, after half an hour of this game of sitting duck had passed, he just got up and left the tram.\n\nOutside, he simply walked off without so much as looking back at me.\n\nEven now, I’ve got no clue what the hell was wrong with that guy. Maybe it was just some asshole trying to fuck with me, but somehow, I feel, he was something far worse.\n\nYet, as terrifying as this half-hour encounter was, it shouldn’t be the most terrifying thing I’d witness on day three.\n\nIt was later that night, as I sat in my seat, unable to fall asleep, that I noticed the first change in scenery.\n\nI told myself it was because it was night time and because of the darkness, but I’d ridden this damned tram for two and a half days by now. I knew the area it passed through. Hell, I knew what buildings were at what station!\n\nStation 17: a giant mall.\n\nStation 44: an old hardware store.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYet that night, I occasionally saw new areas, areas that were... different.\n\nAt one point, the tram passed through a street which was lined by nothing but giant, derelict tower blocks. Before long, even the tram tracks themselves seemed to deteriorate.\n\nThe tram rambled on through this forlorn area, shaking slightly, without ever stopping at any station. We must’ve been there for at least ten minutes without ever stopping at a station, which I know is impossible. On the way back, we never passed that area again, almost as if it never existed.\n\nAt other times, the tram took bends and went around corners that shouldn’t be there, and drove on through constricted, half-hidden streets and alleys that seemed almost too small for it to pass.\n\nWhenever we reached one of these strange places, I couldn’t help but stare outside, strangely curious about them. Some streets were so narrow, the tram was only a few inches away from the walls of the building, allowing me to steal glances through open doors and windows.\n\nWhat I saw was... utterly surreal, and made me question if I was even awake, or if all of this was nothing but a weird dream, conjured by two nights of barely catching any sleep and perpetually being stuck in a tram.\n\nIn one window, I was greeted by four people. They weren’t just inside their apartment, but were leaning out the window, their faces almost pressed against the passing tram. Their eyes were empty, their faces without any emotion. Yet when they were right beside me, I couldn’t help but inch away from the tram’s windows, afraid they might do… something.\n\nIn another window, one belonging to a tiny, inconspicuous building, I saw a giant hall that seemed without end. I saw only the floor, but no walls or ceiling. It just continued on seemingly endlessly, and was much, much too large for the building that contained it. Yet from the far back, off in the darkness of the most distant parts of that hall, I thought I saw eyes watching me.\n\nEventually, the tram approached a station in one such area, and then came to a halt.\n\nOutside, I saw a strange figure. At first, I thought it was a drunk person, or maybe someone disabled, given their strange posture and gait. Then my eyes adjusted, and I realized something was entirely wrong with that figure.\n\nIt was some sort of deformed... thing. Its limbs were bent at strange angles, seemed to have too many joints in them and sprouted from places they shouldn’t.\n\nAs the tram stood there, it crooked its head slightly in my direction. Then its head pushed forward, its neck stretching further and further, much further than should be possible.\n\nSweat broke out all over my body as I found the ghastly creature measuring me up and down. This time, it wasn’t just fear that came over me, but full on panic. My body started shaking uncontrollably, and I had to cling to the seat in front of me to somehow keep the panic at bay, to not freak out completely at the surreal sight outside.\n\nSlowly, the thing moved, approached the tram door on its long, spidery limbs and I already saw it entering the tram, saw it coming for me.\n\nAs it took these few select steps, I hoped, prayed, it would stay where it was. I think in the state I was in, I spoke, probably yelled those words repeatedly through the empty tram. Until, thankfully, the doors closed, and we left the waking nightmare behind.\n\nFor the next minutes, I just sat in my seat, my eyes closed, my knees below my chin and rocking back and forth like a scared little child. Eventually, when I opened my eyes again, all was normal, and the tram continued on its usual route, and did so for the rest of the night.\n\nBy now, it’s early morning. I haven’t been able to sleep yet, I couldn’t. Whenever I was about to doze off, I was afraid I’d end up at some unfamiliar surreal location again, and this time, the creature would actually enter the tram.\n\nInstead, I spent the last hour typing this all out to calm myself down.\n\nTo be honest, I thought about giving up, to just get off and call it quits after what had happened. But then, I thought about it. I was on day three, on day freaking three. If I stopped now, my friends would never let it go.\n\nMost important of all, however, as scary as these experiences were, they were also strangely fascinating. If I’d got off now, I’d probably regret it and wonder what else I might have seen on the Long Ride.\n\nSo I guess I’ll keep going for a while longer.

        "text": "I was awaken by the sound of the ceiling fan giving off a harsh clutch. I laid in bed peacefully, it had to be around 2 in the morning, the outside was still pitch dark. I stared at the ceiling fan, wanting to know where that sound came from exactly but it looked fine, spinning at a normal speed. I was too tired to even think at this time, I turned to my right side to fall back to sleep and I jolted when I saw that my son Christopher was standing right beside me by the bed, smiling, as if he was ready to start his day. \n\n“Christopher, what are you doing?”, I asked. \nHe continued smiling. He had a look in his eyes like he was up to something. I was waiting for him to respond. \n“Christopher, I asked you a question”.\n“Hi mom”, he replied. \n“Hi…, do you know what time it is, honey?\n\nHe just stood there smiling. I was bewildered at this point as to what he wanted. \n\n“Honey, you should go to bed”.\n“I have someone who wants to meet you”, he said. \n\nI was confused. I had no idea what he was talking about. I stood up and turned on the lamp. Christopher had the largest eye bags and still wouldn’t let go of that smile. \n\n“Honey, have you been up all night, you look dead tired”\n\nHe giggled.\n\n“Yes mom, I’ve been talking to Mr. Happy all night and he says he wants to meet you. We should grace his presence.”\nI was starting to get terrified. My son is 6 years old and he doesn’t have anyone to talk to besides me. I tried brushing it off. I got out of bed, grabbed his right hand and walked him back to his room. I put him back in his bed and tucked him in. He still had that smile on him. \n\n“Christopher, it’s night time ok, I get you’re in a good mood but mommy doesn’t like to woken up in the middle of the night”. \n\nHe finally let go of that smile and looked at me…scared. \n\n“Did I make you unhappy, momma?”, he asked. \n“No, honey-“\n“He doesn’t like it when people are unhappy”, he interrupted. \n“Who?”, I asked. \n“Mr. Happy”\nI had enough.\n“Honey, who is Mr Happy?”\n“He’s the man I talk to, he says that he’s tired of you being miserable because of the divorce with dad and your misery is only making him angry and stronger”.\n\n“Stronger?”, I replied. \n“Yes. Mr. Happy wants the whole world to be happy.”, he said. \nI didn’t know how to respond. I noticed a bruise on Christopher’s right arm. A large dark red bruise. \n“Christopher, what happened to your arm?”\n“He told me not to tell you”\nI was upset at this point. \n\n“Christopher, you stop this stupid non sense and tell me what happened to your god damn arm? Who hurt you?” I yelled at him.\n\nHe started crying and he bursted it out. \n“It was Mr Happy, he wouldn’t let go until I changed my frown into a smile, he says he’s going to do the same to you but to your neck.”\n\nI was fuming, I couldn’t take it, I don’t know how Christopher can come up with all this. My son is not mentally ill, I know someone hurt him and he wasn’t making this up. \n\n“I want to meet him, where is Mr. Happy?”\n\nChristopher stopped his crying and pointed at his closet. \n\nI turned my head around, slowly got up and walked towards his closet. I saw Christopher was slowly getting a panic attack. \n\n“Mom, don’t open the closet, I’m scared”.\nI ignored him. I opened the closet door as quickly as I could but there was nothing. Christopher let out a sigh of relief and I as well. Then I felt something funny, like I had eaten dry hard popcorn, I started to choke. \n\n“Mom, what’s wrong?”, Christopher yelled. \n\n“MOM!”\n\nI was being choked by an entity. I locked my hands around my neck as I was slowly being levitated. Christopher couldn’t stop screaming.\n\n“He wants you to be happy, mom! He wants you to be happy!”\n\nI couldn’t breath, it was getting tighter, I can feel an extreme pressure as if I was about to faint, all I can hear was Christopher yelling with the words “be happy” back and forth. \n\nI needed to get out of this. I looked at my son who was crying his eyes out and panicking and I did what I had to do at this point, I had to be happy, so I extended a huge smile across my face as I was being severely choked to death. \nI dropped to the floor. He let go of me. I was grasping for all the air I could and my neck felt as stiff as a post. \n\nChristopher came running at my comfort. He hugged me and then he whispered\n“Be happy momma”\n\nI was crying my eyes out, trying to catch every breath of air I could and I looked at my son…and I smiled, as so did he.",

        "text": "\n\nI work at a small diner in a rural town. It's not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills and I get to meet some interesting people. Most of them are regulars who come in for their coffee and pie, or their burgers and fries. They're friendly enough, and they tip well.\n\nBut there's one customer who always gives me the creeps. He only comes in late at night, when I'm about to close up. He's tall and thin, with pale skin and dark hair. He wears a long black coat and a fedora hat that covers his eyes. He never says a word, just points at the menu and slides some cash across the counter.\n\nHe always orders the same thing: a slice of cherry pie and a glass of milk. He eats slowly, savoring every bite. He never looks up from his plate, or at me. He just stares at the pie, as if it's the most fascinating thing in the world.\n\nI don't know why he freaks me out so much. Maybe it's his silence, or his appearance, or his odd choice of food. Maybe it's the way he leaves no trace behind when he finishes his meal: no crumbs on the plate, no stains on the glass, no fingerprints on the cash.\n\nBut what really scares me is what happens after he leaves.\n\nEvery time he comes in, something bad happens in town. A car accident, a fire, a murder. It's always something violent and tragic, and it always involves someone I know.\n\nThe first time he came in was two months ago. The next day, my best friend Jenny was killed in a hit-and-run on her way to school.\n\nThe second time he came in was three weeks ago. The next day, my boss Frank was found dead in his apartment with stab wounds all over his body.\n\nThe third time he came in was last week. The next day, my boyfriend Mike was shot by an intruder who broke into our house.\n\nAnd tonight...he came in again.\n\nHe ordered his usual slice of cherry pie and glass of milk. He ate slowly and quietly as usual. He paid with cash as usual.\n\nBut this time...he looked at me.\n\nHe lifted his head and stared right into my eyes with a cold and cruel smile.\n\nHe said one word:\n\n\"Delicious.\"\n\nThen he got up and left.\n\nI don't know what he meant by that word. I don't know what he wants from me. I don't know what he's going to do to me.\n\nBut I do know one thing:\n\nI'm not going to make it through this night.\n\nI locked up the diner and ran to my car, my heart pounding in my chest. As I drove home, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was following me. I checked my rearview mirror, but I didn't see anything. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nWhen I got home, I locked all the doors and windows, and turned on all the lights. I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that I was just being paranoid. But deep down, I knew that something was wrong.\n\nI heard a noise outside, a rustling in the bushes. I peered through the window, but I couldn't see anything. Then I heard a knock at the door.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. Who could it be at this hour? I hesitated, then slowly approached the door. I looked through the peephole, but all I saw was darkness.\n\n\"Who is it?\" I called out.\n\nNo answer.\n\nI cautiously opened the door, ready to slam it shut at the first sign of danger. But there was no one there.\n\nJust a slice of cherry pie and a glass of milk on the doorstep.\n\nI recoiled in horror. It was the same order that the man had made at the diner. How did he know where I lived? And why did he leave me this sinister gift?\n\nSuddenly, the lights went out. I was plunged into darkness, with only the faint glow of the moonlight coming in through the window.\n\nI heard footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming closer and closer. I could feel his presence, his malevolent energy. He was in the room with me.\n\nI tried to run, but my feet wouldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. I felt a cold breath on my neck, and then a voice whispered in my ear:\n\n\"Delicious.\"\n\nAnd then...nothing.\n\nI woke up the next morning, lying on the floor. The lights were back on, and everything seemed normal. But I knew that something had happened. Something terrible.\n\nI went to the diner later that day, hoping to find some answers. But the man was nowhere to be seen. The other customers looked at me with pity and concern, as if they knew what had happened to me.\n\nI quit my job that day, and left the town for good. I never found out who the man was, or what he wanted from me. But I knew that I would never forget him, or the taste of cherry pie.",

        "text": "Near the bar area of ​​my city you can find a corridor hidden between the buildings that will take you to an area not very well known to the public, an apparently innocent patio of light, on the north wall of this \"bubble\" within The block is where I work, the only place in this place if you don't count the vending machines outside.\n\nAn old bar, with an emphasis on “old”, it is not a very big bar, we have capacity for only 13 people, not many people visit us and only 2 people work here, Rocco and me.\n\nI prepare the drinks and serve the customers while Rocco prepares the appetizers, yes, we sell appetizers, from simple bar peanuts to calamari fritti in the purest Italian style, but in this place we have special rules for customers, one of them is that, if Rocco knows how to prepare a dish that is not on the menu, we prepare the dish for the customer and mark it as a \"special dish\".\n\nI like to say that we are a dynamic duo, although I can rarely see his face beyond the window that leads to the kitchen, besides that Rocco is not very talkative, or rather, he does not speak at all.\n\nBut that doesn't matter, this bar is a very pathetic one, old bottles decorate the place next to dark wooden walls and a slight smell of cigarettes (which is weird because I don't let anyone smoke inside the bar), a full pool table dust in the center of the place is the only means of entertainment for customers along with our old radio and television, and to finish the tour, a bathroom, where I'm sure more than one person died of overdose.\n\nIt's all you can see in this place, not for nothing we don't have many clients, of course, that and our \"style\" does not combine well with our hours or location.\n\nWe are so hidden that only interesting people visit us, I could tell you about the old woman who always tries to sell us ground meat of dubious quality, how we always run out of turnips, although we never serve them, about the empty bathroom that screams incoherently, or maybe want to hear something else get excited.\n\nLike that time the bar filled up with a bunch of people who I'm sure were part of some weird cult, which is weird, we never have that many customers, or that other time when a couple had a pretty violent fight, they left. and within minutes they returned unharmed, they repeated the fight over and over again all night, I sold a lot of wine that night.\n\nBut those stories are for another day or to be forgotten over a drink.\n\nOur shift is from 10 at night to 6 in the morning, so I don't have much free time at night, I sleep almost all day and at this point you could say that my best friends are: Rocco, the chair that I have behind the bar and our radio, since the damn television turns itself on and off, I have tried to unplug it, but I still can't find the power cord.\n\nThis place is strange and boring most of the nights, that's why I'm starting this diary, lacking things to do, I just have to record my days working in this bar, either that or try to guess who is living on the walls, or trying to guess what the vending machines outside say, I think they are written in Chinese or something, it's not like I can see my phone, there's almost no signal here, we don't have internet and our only means of communication It's a telephone.\n\nIf you manage to find this place and make the decision to enter this bar, you will always see me there, standing at the bar waiting for customers, with a bored look lost in my thoughts, you will be able to see Rocco's torso leaning out of the kitchen window, almost always with a cookbook in his hands, I don't know if it's an admirable work ethic or he's just as bored as I am.\n\nBut anyway, I spend every day, Tuesday to Sunday, working from 10 to 6, in this place, I'm the weird guy who makes the drinks and takes the orders, everyone calls me “Peter”, even if that's not my name, if you arrive at my bar and you are the first to show this post I will buy you a drink, it is not easy to find us if you do not know the area, but if one day you enter a corridor and at the end you see a bar with the neon sign that says \"Ghost Apple\", congratulations, you've arrived at the worst bar in town, where a loser and a giant will serve you tonight!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight's specialty is:\n\nNothing, we are closed",

        "text": "I was in my room listening to a scary video. One of those where you listen to scary voices that say creepy things or eerie children laughing or a creepy woman crying or something like that. Don't ask me why I like to scare myself like that but I do. There's something about that adrenaline rush you get from being scared that I find super fun. The video I listened to was a Five Nights at Freddy's video where the animatronics were talking in a creepy way and saying creepy things, nothing more than that. I lay in my bed while I listened to it. Suddenly the lights went off. Hmm, that's odd I thought to myself. I paused the video getting scared. I brushed it off thinking it was probably a natural explanation to it. I had to check the fuse box, I went out of my room and the whole house was dark. I pulled out my phone from my pocket and put on the flashlight. \n\nI started to make my way towards the fuse box but while doing so I couldn't help but feel like someone was watching me. The entire house was engulfed in silence. I brushed the feeling off reassuring myself that I was just scared. I got to the fuse box and flipped the switch, the lights came on and I sighed feeling relieved. The feeling of being watched disappeared and I felt much better. I got back to my room and resumed the video. After 1 minute in the video, the lights went off again. What in the world is going on? I thought to myself. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. I made my way towards the fuse box once again. This time I felt more scared than I did the first time. \n\nI opened the door to my room to find my house was again pitch black. It was night time so there was no sun outside. I made my way cautiously towards the fuse box feeling like someone was watching my every move. I suddenly got the feeling of someone standing behind me but when I checked there was nobody there. I looked around to see if I could spot something. There was nothing. I stopped to listen for a while but I couldn't hear anything either. I got to the fuse box and flipped the switch again. The lights came on once again. I stood still for a moment, listening. Nothing. Even though the lights came on, the feeling of being watched wouldn't go away. \n\nI got an idea to tape the switch, that way the power wouldn't go out again. I went downstairs and looked in the kitchen drawer for tape. To my luck, I found some in the drawer. I got back up and taped the switch so it would stay in its place. It made me feel a little better but still, I couldn't quite manage to shake the feeling that someone or something was watching me. I got to my room again and sat on my bed, my room was just the way I had left it. Nothing suspicious. I listened for a while longer. Nothing. I'm probably just scared and that's why I keep imagining that I'm being watched I told myself. I tried to calm myself down by saying that it was just my imagination. After all, it was impossible that someone was watching me. I live alone, no wife, no pets and no kids, just me. \n\nI moved out of my parent's house when I was 20 years old and now I live in another town far away from them. That's the way I like it. I liked being alone, focusing on myself and doing exactly what I wanted to. I pressed play on the video again, I was still feeling a little on edge. I kind of thought that it was super fun but at the same time, the light incident freaked me out. I listened to the video for about 5 minutes when it happened again. \n\nThat damned light went off for the third time. I paused the video and got really scared. This time I knew that someone had to be in the house. I grabbed a pair of scissors that was on my bedside table., I don't really know why I had scissors on my bedside table but right now I thanked myself for it. I was going to use the scissors in case there were burglars in my house. I pulled out my phone and switched on the flashlight again. \n\nI slowly made my way to the door and listened. Nothing. I listened a little while longer. Still nothing. I opened the door quietly, everything was dark, the only light came from my phone. I stood in the doorway with my guard up, I tightened my grip on the scissors and listened. Nothing. I looked around but couldn't see anything.
