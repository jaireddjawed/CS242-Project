        "text": "This [CNN article](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/16/news/economy/house-tax-bill-vote/index.html) goes through how the bill will affect individuals and corporations. It seems the most talked about provisions of the bill are reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, creating 4 tax brackets, eliminating the estate tax, as well as changing several deductions and credits. While the Senate and House Republicans claim the bill will grow the GDP and help the economy and taxpayers, Democrats call it a \"tax cut for the rich,\" [criticize what the bill will do to helath care](http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/363966-for-the-benefit-of-our-children-congress-must-reject-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs), and claim that the bill will grow the debt. \n\nThis bill is very complicated and will obvioulsy have some winners and some loosers. Overall, will the bill have a positive or negative affect on the economy and the middle and lower classes? ",

        "text": "Net neutrality is the hot topic of the day but another issue at hand is antitrust. Amazon in particular has come under scrutiny after its [acquisition of Whole Foods Market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/06/16/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-market-in-deal-valued-at-13-7-billion-2/?utm_term=.81d2c0921199).\n\n(Full disclosure: I work for Amazon but am obviously posting here in a private capacity.)\n\nHistorically, antitrust law has focused on horizontal monopolies, i.e., one firm cornering an entire market by crowding out competitors at the same stage of production. Vertical integration, in contrast, focuses more on owning the entirety of your upstream or downstream production chain. This is an oversimplification but is fine for the purpose of a high level conversation.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, acquiring Whole Foods gives them control of grocery distribution to supply their Fresh delivery system. To use another example, [look at the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730906-vertical-integration-could-put-brake-americas-unsustainably-soaring-health-care-costs):\n\n&gt;The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers. If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of United’s pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.\n\nNon-specific tidbits on the [argument in favor](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696911-tech-fashion-old-management-idea-back-vogue-vertical-integration-gets-new) of vertical consolidation:\n\n- Better integrated products (i.e., creating an ecosystem in which it is easier to get everything you need in one space);\n- Efficiency of doing things in-house;\n- Building customer relationships (via integration and the subsequent creation of frictionless consumer experiences)\n- Speed and efficiency from owning your entire production process;\n- Minimizing risk across uncertain geopolitical space\n\nThe trade-off in this is the potential reduction of consumer choice and \"boxing in\" of customer behavior (see: [Vox's analysis](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2017/12/4/16731310/cvs-aetna-merger) of the Aetna/CVS merger for examples). Likewise, we can see privacy concerns, such as tech ecosystems that collect data in one capacity to inform another (e.g., Amazon using Whole Foods to collect customer behavior data to hone their advertisement algorithms).\n\nMoreover, the reason why I mentioned net neutrality is because implicit in that argument is a concern over information limitation and throttling, but we can see examples of this with firms that own downstream production and content. Using Amazon as an example again, we have [historical examples](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0) of the company deprioritizing book search results related to a publishing dispute. Today, Amazon and Google are in a spat that has resulted in the [loss of Youtube functionality](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices) across Amazon devices.\n\nThus there is significant control over content here, at least in so far as we have a major player in one market able to influence an area where they have a smaller share but nevertheless major influence on access to a good or service. This is a particularly acute concern where that influence is tethered to a medium or platform with a strong correlation to information dissemination, such as vieo.\n\nThe additional historical justification for antitrust law has been the argument that it's bad for consumers, typically by limiting their choice to a single firm that has significant price control. The traditional metrics have been market share and pricing.\n\nBut how should we evaluate vertical integration if: (1) it doesn't usually increase market share that much (e.g., Amazon still accounts for very little of the grocery market post-Whole Foods acquisition); (2) arguably it creates a better environment for consumers who want fast and frictionless goods/services, and; (3) we have yet to come up with a strong corollary for market share and price controls as the metrics for \"too much\"?\n\nSpecific questions:\n\n- Should this be policed more explicitly and increased rigor?\n- What are the measurements by which we determine vertical integration has exceeded an appropriate threshold?\n- Arguably this is more of a concern across data collection and communication areas. Is this less an antitrust concern and more of a communications and data security matter?",

There is currently a spate of sexual misconduct scandals affecting politicians in the wake of the #MeToo movement.\n\nHowever, certain politicians find themselves undone by scandal, while others weather the storm or even enjoy a rally effect from the controversy.\n\nFor instance, [Anthony Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison] (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anthony-weiner-sentenced-nearly-two-years-prison-sexting-scandal-n803906) for sexting an underage girl, losing his wife and his career in the process.\n\nRep Tim Murphy (R-PA) recently resigned when it was revealed [he had had an extra-marital affair with a woman and prompted her to get an abortion.] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/rep-tim-murphy-resigns-from-congress-after-allegedly-asking-woman-to-have-abortion/2017/10/05/7a68a414-aa08-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?utm_term=.48d145f21f87) Murphy was notably a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus and supported pro-life legislation.\n\nHowever, others survived their controversies. [Bill Clinton was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate] (http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-clinton-impeached) during his presidency and served out the remainder of his term, [even getting a bump in approval rating.] (http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/20/impeachment.poll/)\n\n[President Donald Trump is accused by 13 women of various forms of sexual impropriety and making unwanted advances.] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/22/president-trump-and-accusations-of-sexual-misconduct-the-complete-list/?utm_term=.d28f137cb62b) However, he has faced no legal or professional consequences as a result other than [a currently ongoing defamation lawsuit by one of the accusers, Summer Zervos.] (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/presidents-immune-civil-lawsuits-state-court-private-conduct) He also [settled fraud cases against him for the defunct Trump University for $25 million, citing his schedule as president-elect as the reason for the settlement.] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/source-trump-nearing-settlement-in-trump-university-fraud-cases/2016/11/18/8dc047c0-ada0-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html?utm_term=.31a967b2268a)\n\n[Rep Greg Gianforte (R-MT) was charged with assault after bodyslamming Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs] (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/24/greg-gianforte-bodyslams-reporter-ben-jacobs-montana) after Jacobs asked a question the night before the election &amp; [was found to have misled investigators after the incident.] (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/greg-gianforte-guardian-reporter-ben-jacobs-assault) He plead guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and was sentenced to community service, anger management and a $385 fine.\n\nRoy Moore (R - AL) is currently running for Senate in Alabama, who will vote next week. [He has been accused by nine women of sexual misconduct,] (http://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-roy-moore-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-11) with the majority being underage at the time of the alleged incidents.

[Recent polls show Moore with a narrow lead.] (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/senate/al/alabama_senate_special_election_moore_vs_jones-6271.html)\n\n[Rep John Conyers (D-MI) yesterday resigned his House seat  as a result of sexual harassment charges from former aides.] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/conyers-wont-seek-reelection-following-harassment-allegations-report-says/2017/12/05/17057ea0-d9bb-11e7-a841-2066faf731ef_story.html)\n\n[In addition, Senator Al Franken (D-MN) has an announcement planned tomorrow in which he will reportedly resign amid multiple women coming forward accusing him of unwanted groping and sexual advances.] (http://www.startribune.com/source-says-franken-plans-to-resign/462299103/)\n\nGiven the wide-ranging outcomes across the board, I've got a handful of questions I'd like to discuss.\n\n1. What determines how much of an effect a scandal will have on a candidate's career? \n\n2. Are there any commonalities between scandals that have stuck and ones that don't have an effect?\n\n\n3. Are certain types of scandals more impactful than others? If so, which have been the least/most impactful, historically?\n\n4. How does partisanship affect this? Are scandals perceived differently depending on party?\n\n5. Are there qualities about the scandal or the people involved that determines whether it will have a positive or negative effect? If so, what are they?\n\n6. Can a scandal affect not only the candidate themselves, but spill over into the perception of their party itself? Are there any historical examples of this? Were the effects long- or short-term?\n\nFeel free to discuss any of these questions or anything else you think is pertinent. I'm just looking to spur conversation and find historical examples of how political scandals played out to see if there are any patterns we can observe.",

        "text": "For those unfamiliar with the case, basically a gay couple (Charlie Craig and David Mullins) came to Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado and asked the owner, Jack Phillips, to make a cake for them for their wedding. Phillips told them that although they're welcome to purchase a pre-made cake or other varieties of dessert, he will not create a cake specifically for same-sex weddings.\n\nCraig and Mullins filed a lawsuit against Phillips for discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (\"[CADA](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-24/principal-departments/article-34/part-6/section-24-34-601)\"), which they won in district court. The Colorado Appellate court upheld the ruling saying that Phillips must provide custom cakes for **any** wedding, so long as he offers custom wedding cakes as a service (he has actually stopped making wedding cakes at all since this ruling, a move which he reports cost him 40% of his business and forced him to lay off half of his staff [(Source)](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/05/politics/supreme-court-masterpiece-cakeshop/index.html). \n\nNow, Phillips is arguing that CADA violates the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) by compelling him to create something in conflict with his religious beliefs. \n\nThis will surely be an important First Amendment case for the Court. What are the legal arguments in support of both sides?",

Some say this is happening, and that CIA Director Mike Pompeo is lobbying for it himself. Others - includes spokespeople for the CIA itself - say that the White House would never support this, and that it has never come to their attention.

Has anything like this been done before in the United States? Do our current laws and the current makeup of our national security apparatus allow something like this to happen? Do the CIA or the President have any authority to supercede what laws may exist on the books and approve this themselves, particularly in the context of their _not_ being any laws on it right now?",

Does this mean if Pence didn't leave office he too would have to be impeached to be removed?\n\nEdit:  To make this post compliant for this subreddit, linking a Politifact article on Obstruction of Justice and Presidential culpability.  \n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/17/obstruction-justice-presidential-immunity-impeachm/",
