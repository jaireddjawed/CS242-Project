So, in theory, an advanced haki user should be able to get themselves out of the petrification caused by the love-love fruit. Furthermore, we saw in Wano that advanced haki users and can project their haki out onto other objects or their opponents to damage them from them inside. Can't those same users use their haki to break someone else out of petrification?\n\nI have a feeling that Franky and Ussop would be saved by luffy using his haki to break them out. That is how I imagine an emperor's crew should solve their problems, though haki and strength.",

Sanji is one of my favorite straw hats hands down I think he's p cute and funny. However, on my reread of the post marineford arc I can't help but cringing every 2 seconds. We've seen Oda portray drag queens like bon clay, Iva, and the new kama ppl pretty well so its upsetting and saddinging to see this portrayal to say the least. Tbh tho I didn't have a super big problem with it until Sanji meets up with the crew and starts sighing because he's finally able to see real women again is what he says. We've seen through Iva's powers that he can turn anyone into their preferred sex if they want it, so the members of Kamabaka are clearly dressing in drag and are men not women. Yes its joke but still Sanji's reactions can't help but make me feel a tad dysphoric as a trans girl given the fact that I struggle with thinking of myself as a real woman even though I pass and look nothing like the Kamabaka drag queens. Anyway tiny little rant if you read it thanks!!! I hope everyone has a great day/night!",

The whole SkyNet thing made me think about the reason why Ancient Kingdom (AK) have fallen. Here goes:\n\n* We know AK were a advanced tech society. I believe a similar thing happened to AK (IA becoming sentient) and other kingdoms decided to join and destroy AK and everything else before things got out of control.\n* After they destroyed AK, the kingdoms decided to make a new society but without the whole tech thing. That would explain why they CHOSE not to use the tech knowledge they had when creating this new society.\n* One thing (corruption) led to another (more corruption) and we have the world of One Piece as it is now.\n\nThat would also explain:\n\n* Why Alabasta (portrayed as a \"good\" kingdom) decided to join in the war against AK but avoided the whole celestial dragons thing.\n* And why WG tries so hard to avoid any research on AK (there are obviously many other reasons).\n\nSo what do you guys think? Does it make sense? \n\nI'm not one to post (or even think about) theories and english is not my native language (pretty sure u noticed), so it might be little confusing.

[Aki](https://i.imgur.com/yFaTMCQ.png) and Momonosuke are there too listening.\n\n**Orochi** `nervous`\n\n&gt;What do you mean the「Witching-hour Boy」has been captured? Who did it? I didn't hear any alarm. Where was he stealing from this time?\n\n**Shin'ichi**\n\n&gt;It appears he wasn't stealing at all. Black Maria's squad found him at his place.\n\n**Orochi**\n\n&gt;What? They just took a random boy from his home? Where is he being held? Send a message right away! The shogun orders his release immediately. That boy can't be the「Witching-hour Boy」!!\n\n**Shin'ichi**\n\n&gt;How... how are you so sure, Orochi-sama? I thought you were eager to capture him.\n\n**Orochi** `very nervous`\n\n&gt;And I am! But that's just some boy. How could we know whether he's the「Witching-hour Boy」or not if he's not caught in action?\n\n**Shin'ichi**\n\n&gt;They said they had chased the thief to Ebisu town and after some interrogations, he confessed. Apparently, he's not even that young. It turns out it was a boatsman named [Tonoyasu](https://i.imgur.com/DnsmWj1.png).\n\n**Orochi** `not nervous anymore but angry`\n\n&gt;WHAT?? They've been chasing and interrogating people in Kombu?? This region is off limits for them!!\n\n**Aki** `interrupting`\n\n&gt;Daddy! That's Toko's father...\n\n**Orochi**\n\n&gt;Quiet, Akimanosuke. Adults are speaking. I know who he is.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He's right, Shin'ichi. That man can't be the「Witching-hour Boy」?\n\n**Shin'ichi**\n\n&gt;Er... but how do you know, Orochi-sama?\n\n**Orochi**\n\n&gt;Because he's not a boy? Is he? Would we call him the「Witching-hour Boy」if he was an old man? Regardless, are you questioning me?? Send a message at once. Tell whoever is in charge to hand the man to the Oniwabanshu and get the fuck out of this region.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'll have [Fukurokuju](https://i.imgur.com/A90o2ms.png) go there right now and take care of things.\n\n**Shin'ichi**\n\n&gt;Of course, Orochi-sama. I'll send the message right away, Orochi-sama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that moment, Fukurokuju announces himself from outside the office and asks for permission. As he enters, Shin'ichi leaves and Aki and Momonosuke leave too.\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;Let's go, Momo! This is our chance to do that thing you told me.\n\n**Momonosuke** `happy that Aki remembered`\n\n&gt;Yes! Thank you very much Aki!!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You... You know who the「Witching-hour Boy」is, right?\n\n**Aki** `while they run through the palace`\n\n&gt;Yes. I'm the only one who knows. I won't say it to anyone, but the man they spoke about is innocent.\n\n**Momonosuke**\n\n&gt;Do you know him?\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;Not much. But he's the father of a girl...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;`blushes`\n\n**Momonosuke**\n\n&gt;\"A girl\", huh? 😏  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do you think your father will spare him?\n\n**Aki** `worried`\n\n&gt;I hope so, but I don't know. My father is not a very charitable man. but he's not the monster many think him to be either.\n\n**Momonosuke** `to himself`\n\n&gt;(*Is that the truth? Or is it just what he wants to think of his father?*)\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;Here we are, Momo!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAki opens a door and both kids enter a room where they find Nico Robin chained to the wall.\n\n**Robin** `to herself`\n\n&gt;(*Momo?! What's he doing here??*)\n\n**Momonosuke** `happy`\n\n&gt;Robin-san!! I'm so glad I could find you! Are you hurt??\n\n**Robin** `confused`\n\n&gt;Momo! No, I'm fine. Wha... what are you doing here? We've been looking for you everywhere.\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;No time for explanations, miss.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Take the handcuffs off her with this key. They left it on this table. The keys to the other shackles should be around here too, right?\n\nAki throws Momonosuke the key to the kairōseki handcuffs. But as he grabs the cuffs, he falls to his knees losing all his strength.\n\n**Momonosuke** `surprised`\n\n&gt;What happened to me?\n\n**Robin**\n\n&gt;The cufss are made of kairōseki, Momo. They'll take your strength if you touch them. You have to use the key without touching the cuffs.\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;Found them! I'll take you out of here through my secret passage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAki removes the shackles from Robin and the three of them go to the secret exit. Robin goes out first.\n\n**Momonosuke**\n\n&gt;Robin-san, please, tell Inuarashi that I'm very sorry for the trouble I caused to him. And tell Kin'emon that I apologize to him and the rest too.\n\n**Robin** `confused`\n\n&gt;What do you mean, Momonosuke? C'mon. Let's go you two!\n\n**Momonosuke**\n\n&gt;I'm really, really sorry, Robin-san. But Aki and I stay here.\n\n**Robin**\n\n&gt;What are you say...\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;Miss, if you don't hurry, they're going to find you again. The palace is heavily guarded at night.\n\n[Unknown artist](https://preview.redd.it/5dfxxwey57na1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=36efdca5aee7611cc22f80729bd25aa12ffc04c3)\n\n**Robin**\n\n&gt;Enough with the nonsense, Momo. I'll take you with me by force if I need to.\n\n**Momonosuke**\n\n&gt;Please, Robin-san, I beg you. This is something I need to do. If I am to rule this country and to make justice for my family, I need to see for myself what kind of man is Orochi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He's sworn to protect me as long as I don't leave this castle and I'm willing to take the risk. I didn't return to this country just to take the throne by force and do to others the same others did to me and my family.\n\nBefore she can reply or just grab Momonosuke by force, Robin sprouts an arm from the castle's wall and catches a kunai that was about to pierce her body.\n\n**Unknown ninja guard**\n\n&gt;Who's there??  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hey! Ring the alarm. I saw someone trying to climb into the castle.\n\n**Aki**\n\n&gt;Miss, you must leave right now. The guards are going to chase you. If you take Momo with you now, you'll put him in danger.\n\n**Robin** `impotent`\n\n&gt;Damnit! We'll come for you again, Momonosuke.

The troublemaker of the class turned vice-admiral.\n\n**Smoker**\n\n&gt;Hehe... and the model student all instructors commended for his grades, skills, but most of all, his determination and zeal for「Justice」became a pirate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Zephyr always believed you'd become an admiral one day. What made you switch sides?\n\n**Drake**\n\n&gt;Marines... pirates... When your abusive father has been both...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do you really believe there are two \"sides\", Smoker?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What do you think「Justice」is?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No. Tell me, do you really think Marines and the World Government represent「Justice」?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom a distant cell, more annoyed by what he sees right now than by the situation they're into, [Commodore Mocaccino](https://i.imgur.com/SEU2iUu.png), despite not hearing their conversation, can't be quiet about it.\n\n**Mocaccino**\n\n&gt;Excuse me, Vice-admiral, what's the reason of this friendly chat with a pirate? Our captor no less!!\n\n**Drake** `ignoring Mocaccino`\n\n&gt;Man, what does that guy do here? They sent him with you? You're fucked, Smoker. That guy's bad news...\n\n**Smoker**\n\n&gt;Haha... You talk as if I were leaving this island alive. Yes... my career would be ruined. But I guess I don't have to worry about that now, do I?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot far from there, Sanji heads for the meeting point he and Raizō had agreed on.\n\n**Sanji** `to himself`\n\n&gt;(*It looks like Luffy isn't here. None of the pirates I talked to knew about him. All that's left now is to rescue Smoker and get away from here ASAP. I hope Raizō has found a way.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*At least this time around, Kin'emon's emergency disguise has worked quite well. I'm quite sure they take me for some middle management boss or someone with some authority. They have all been very polite and obedient when I asked.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Good. I can sense Raizō after the next turn.*)\n\nSanji gets to the meeting point and immediately looks up at the ceiling knowing he'll find Raizō hiding there.\n\n**Sanji**\n\n&gt;At last, I found you.\n\nHaving barely finished his sentence, Sanji dodges a shuriken.\n\n**Sanji** `startled`\n\n&gt;Damnit, Raizō! Not again!!\n\nLooking like he had seen a ghost, Raizō throws a smoke bomb and escapes like his life depends on it.\n\n[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/fr1z4ot367na1.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=09d3c5e590a3d9d1d43a8edc2026c5762f089146)\n\n    Kōzuki clan retainer\n    霧の雷ぞう (Raizō, of the Mist)\n    悪魔の実: Maki Maki no Mi (paramecia)\n\n**Raizō** `to himself`\n\n&gt;(*He remembers!!

I suppose it'll be only me rescuing those marines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNear the brig, a young Beast pirate is walking down a corridor when...\n\n**Young pirate** `to himself`\n\n&gt;(*Oh! It's uncle Jack! I didn't know he had come.*)\n\nThe young pirate timidly waves his hand in an attempt to get Jack's attention from the other side of the corridor, but the All-Star doesn't react. Instead, he faces a regular-sized door, opens it and for the young pirate's [massive surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P5qbcRAXVk), the 8 meters tall pirate with a huge body goes through the little door as if it were the most natural thing to do.\n\nInside the brig, Sanji walks to the only pirate guarding the prisoners.\n\n**Sanji**\n\n&gt;(*It's true. They're changing sentries at 3. Everything is going smooth so far. I only need to sound convincing now. I don't know who am I disguised as or how the command chain works here, so better not say I'm on Kaidō's orders.

Did you just say... Jack sends you? **(ʘ ͜ʖ ʘ)**\n\n**Sanji** `a bit unsure`\n\n&gt;Yes. Is that... a problem?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(*Should I just knockout this guy? No. I don't know where are the keys to their cuffs and that guy over there is X Drake. I shouldn't start a fight with him now.*)\n\n**Guard** `more nervous`\n\n&gt;No, no, no, no, no. Not a problem at all. I... I think my mind played a trick on me or something. Just that. Not that I'm drunk or anything. That's not the case... Hm... So... What, what was it you wanted? I'm sorry I didn't listen well...\n\n**Sanji**\n\n&gt;The Marines. I'm taking them. Give me their keys and let them out. It's Jack's orders.\n\nMeanwhile, Drake hasn't payed much attention as he's focused on his conversation.\n\n**Drake** `kneeling but about to stand up`\n\n&gt;I'm very glad to have found an old friend here.\n\n**Smoker** `not as happy`\n\n&gt;I can't say the same, Drake...\n\n**Drake** `leaving`\n\n&gt;Bye, Smoker! Give my regards to Hina. And get that wound treated. It doesn't look good.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'll go to the canteen now. I bet the boys are there getting wasted while the ship is unattended at the bay.\n\nThat last sentence alerts Smoker that immediately realizes that upon standing up, Drake had left a key just below the cell's bars.\n\n**Drake** `as he gets out of the brig`\n\n&gt;You can come if you want too, Jack. It's better than messing with the poor guard.\n\n**Sanji** `frozen`\n\n&gt;(*¿Jack? Don't tell me I'm disguised as that massive man... That's what scared Raizō! What the hell was Kin'emon thinking about??? I'll kill him when I'm back!! I surely stand out like a sore thumb! Well...

        "text": "If you are confused by the title, the post is about “the traitor” on the Egghead Island who keeps shooting Vegapunk. I’m just trying to avoid putting spoilers in the title.\n\nTechnically, calling them “traitor” is incorrect. “**Perpetrator**” would be more accurate, or, you know, “[**Murderer**](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ab4e4426ad9892f375b58584640ad625/2d2d5a85bb846946-41/s1280x1920/283a6ef5f7ee60fe0a1830df0d9d4620d2bcdd15.pnj)”. Oda usually structures his arcs based on one of the popular **Literary genre**; like *Thriller Bark* being **Horror**, *Skypiea* being **Action-Adventure** and *Whole Cake Island* being… a mish-mash of **Disney movie** and **Super Sentai**; and *Egghead* is clearly inspired by the old-school “**Murder Mysteries**” (Crime Friction) akin to [Agatha Christie’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie) series of books about the Detective Hercule Poirot. A classic “[Whodunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit)” premise.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9g32i98556na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5bcfcf10f0826f2f83a5205aadba114f5f37e644\n\nMurder Mysteries have certain tropes that are a staple of the genre and which most of them follow. Now, there are **A LOT** of them for me to list them all but I will mention the most relevant ones and hopefully, by the time we are done we will have a better understanding of this whole situation.\n\n# · Misjudged death\n\nWhile not all mysteries are “murder” mysteries, most do start with a death. In this case, it’s not as much as death as different people wanting to kill someone; that someone being **Vegapunk**. His disappearance is what kicks off the mystery. We think he just got lost after Bonney chased him away but we later learn he was kidnapped. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynr3tp7656na1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=96d91e9c799ce6d9caae98e9fbcb52f9a980ce35\n\n# · Incompetent police\n\nRelated to the misjudged death trope, police are often drawing the wrong conclusions in mysteries. Even if the main sleuth is on the force, they're surrounded by incompetent (and often antagonistic) co-workers. CP0 might not be there to figure out who has done the murder but they are presented as rather incompetent and a foil to Straw Hats.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s395d3756na1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=006d02f62e39416fef2a6c418f2534fad4c8726a\n\n# · Red Herring\n\nUsually, there is a character that is the primary suspect for the murder and the story makes it quite obvious that they did it. However, this is purposefully done to mislead the audience from the actual murderer. It’s a “misdirect”. I believe that in this case, it’s Stussy that is meant to be a Red herring. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kuzw65856na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b1a3193620091bf35147df676a35ac5c5a66e69\n\nWe are introduced to the idea that there is a **double agent** on Egghead and it’s then revealed that it was Stussy. However, the troubles surrounding Vegapunk still haven’t stopped meaning the real perpetrator is still out there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sv3qfzv856na1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b14610e0d9ad718acf92aefbb9b103fd1c901116\n\nAdmittedly, this one is a bit shaky but I do think there might be something befitting more of this trope.  More on this later.\n\n# · Unsuspecting Suspect\n\nThere is always that one character that no one suspects to be the murderer, which makes them the most likely to **BE** the murderer. They hide in plain sight, unassuming, maybe they have a disability that makes them impossible to even consider. Or maybe they spend their entire day just **eating and shitting**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owk4q5ea56na1.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2cc6d07cb25dbb31efbba9cb94aa4b3ad5769aaf\n\n# · Villainous victim\n\nThe only person who seems to consider Vegapunk as a villain is Bonney but that still doesn’t mean he can’t fit this criteria. A lot of people still want to kill Vegapunk for different reasons: Bonney, the World Government and the mystery figure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h93ifi9b56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d2a5a359fc4061b4cef12049a87cb4f6d05c0ea\n\n# · Everybody done it\n\nIs the murderer Person A, Person B, or Person C? There's no rule against making it all of the above (or two of the above). In fact, the multiple murderer trope can help the \"early suspect\" get off the radar. They can be working together or working independently (without knowledge of each other's nefarious deeds). Whether it's one or many doing it, don't ignore the possibility of...\n\n# · Second Murder\n\nFirst murder kicks off the story (Vegapunk disappearing); the second one **complicates it**. Usually, it helps exonerate the “Red Herring”. Of course, with Vegapunk it’s a bit different since he has **6 other bodies**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmz9i78c56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=419f5e7e877668032ad671f0214b77fd0f69c5f3\n\n# · Stuck together\n\nAnother way to drive up the tension and stakes is to have your characters stuck together, whether it's a roomy home, a train, or an **island**. Throw in dangerous weather conditions that conspire to capture everyone together, and it's time to hurry up and find that murderer before another body turns up. Sounds familiar?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3d4rr7ad56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a711e013fd65a8ab970ea5b16ff42c90910ca344\n\n# · Nosy character with a vital information gets it\n\nThese nosy characters sometimes turn into the actual sleuth. Or they become a help (or hindrance) to the actual sleuth. Maybe the person was a witness or a co-conspirator. Or perhaps they know about a former relationship, past career, or maybe **that person** finds Vegapunk tied in the basement. The point is that this person has vital information they're ready to deliver, but end up with a **bullet** **to** **their** **brain**. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nhprnxd56na1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f9c95cae5810052efb5a248540c443d99b1254cb\n\n# · Detective team up\n\nNot as much as a “detective team up” as a team up between two groups that are enemies. This trope usually has two detectives that don’t like each other and often but heads, teaming up together to achieve a common goal. In this case, Lucci and Kaku want to team up with Luffy and Zoro to fight the Seraphims. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zix2jfoe56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=99a10a2e8303a990c40f9309e1c8fc7e49509b14\n\n# · Detective suspect\n\nWho is a more \"unassuming suspect\" than the detective? The answer is nobody. However, we don’t really have a detective, for now, but we do have the Straw Hats and the **Satellites**. Just because the Satellites are Vegapunk it doesn’t mean they don’t want to kill him.\n\n[Remember, everyone done it.](https://preview.redd.it/97z7drff56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a21e0e39ecdb5a68d0d1c521a9b2b88e61b9aa00)\n\n# · Criminal consultants\n\nThe theory is \"to catch a killer, you have to think like a killer.\" So who better to consult in a murder case than someone who committed murders? Who better to find the double agent and Vegapunk than the Miss. Double Agent herself?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1bar5kh56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d7714d181e40d2b0586a42f94e67909230cf5c54\n\n# · History returns\n\nThis trope can go a few different directions. The first one involves the detective. Since we don’t have a detective lets ignore this one. Second, another character (a **possible** **suspect** and/or **victim**) has to face something from their past. We already had a number of reminders of Ohara and Vegapunk’s involvement with it, not to mention his past with Kuma.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x26jcfj56na1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=05798173ede70161b15174de8b2867793ce661d6\n\n**However**, I think whoever is “the murderer” is targeting Vegapunk for **another reason**. The World Government wants him gone because his knowledge of Poneglyphs (and Ohara) and Bonney wants him dead because of his involvement with Kuma, so I think this mystery person wants him gone because of **something else**. Something we might see in the **current Cover Story**.\n\n# · Lights Off\n\nThe trope usually involves the reversal of fortune for the protagonist (detective in most cases) and it doesn’t always involve quite literally turning the lights off. Sometimes, it’s turning the Seraphims on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwxuvbwk56na1.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f5bf66b7204569f310c53c0b13bb07968cd4af4d\n\n# · Absent Murderer\n\nKeeping the eventual murderer absent from the main action is a useful trope in keeping the readers from guessing too early who they are. The murderer in Egghead’s case is likely someone who we have seen but they **haven’t had a big role** to play so far or **haven’t been the main focus**. It’s also possible that we didn’t see the murderer at all but that would make for a rather unsatisfying reveal.\n\n# · In Plain Sight\n\nPart of what people love about murder mysteries is trying to solve the mystery themselves. Some of the best stories in the genre help viewers do this by hiding clues and revelations in plain sight that, **on a reread** makes you go “***You should’ve figured it out sooner!***”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucvrlgpl56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=919df6f23b637eed122ca140a0131fa6ee10bcdd\n\n# · Amnesia\n\nThe opposite of being a person with vital information is a person who can't remember any of the vital information because of amnesia. However, this person may not be safe, because they may remember something with enough time. I don’t know if this really fits into this category but Kuma’s memory do play a big role in this arc. Whatever comes out of this will be monumental for the reveal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77p1qvdm56na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=50be7ba8d19aa1bd47599deb59898944dafa56fa\n\n# · Light bulb moment\n\nThis is the moment when all the puzzle pieces (or all but one) come together in ***One Piece*** and the mystery is figured out. It's obvious they've narrowed the field down to one (or two) suspects, and they call everyone together for...\n\n# · Big Reveal\n\nWhoever the murderer is, it would be impossible for us to correctly guess… **right** **now**. The mystery is slowly building until the “Big Reveal” which is a point in the story where everything gets resolved in swift succession, or in this case, a single Chapter that will tie every hint into a **single** **reveal**. As we still don’t have every hint, this is not a possibility.\n\n# So...Whodunit?\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, I want to try to make **an educated guess** as to who the perpetrator is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dibd8n0n86na1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c1081476629e05e4a5591b802e083d5236ad961\n\nThe *Egghead Island Arc* is an arc all about **Vegapunk** and Vegapunk was part of the scientific group by the name of **M.A.D.S**. Another member of the MADS is also part of the arc, that being **Stussy** which prior to her reveal appeared in the Cover Story also focusing on MADS and featuring **Queen**, **Caesar** and **Judge**. It’s evident that the current Cover Story is much more intertwined than the previous Cover Stories as it directly tie in with what is happening in the current arc.\n\nAnother trope of a Murder Mystery is what I call “**Time Dilation**”. It’s a trope where you are lead to believe that the events you are witnessing are set during **one period in time** while it is later revealed it was set during a **totally different period in time**. The Cover Story of ***Chapter*** ***1077***, the Chapter named “*You should’ve Figured It out Sooner*” features Judge and Caesar in “present day” conspiring to get rid of Vegapunk. What if these events aren’t happening currently but rather occurred **shortly** **before** the start of the *Egghead Island Arc* and the name of the Chapter is literally telling us, the readers, that we should’ve figured out the two of them are responsible?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ujc8wyu56na1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2eb38e18ca9862c6b2562ba04665e35c0a3e8e9d\n\nCaesar worked with Vegapunk until recently, and he worked with him on Punk Hazard where King was experimented on, so it’s very plausible he is quite familiar with how the system at Egghead works. After all, Stussy was familiar with the working of the Island; and she is also currently missing from the action when Sanji kicked Jim-brat. Judge is known for his clone Germa 66 army and genetically enhancing his kids. Judge gave his kids abilities similar to Devil Fruits and Vegapunk managed to quite literally copy the Devil Fruit abilities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc3ww6e776na1.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=684413ee9e53ef6df48cd51292adc5a7104267df\n\nThe biggest thorn in this theory is that this whole thing dates **back 2 months**, and there is no way the ending of *Whole Cake Island* happened that far back. It’s possible that Caesar or more likely Judge had a spy on Egghead, a clone that Vegapunk made that they secretly engineered to be their \"inside guy\". Doflamingo is seen with a gun so a [Seraphim Doflamingo](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N15hZ5HZTQI/maxresdefault.jpg) could be that guy. **However**, a more likely case is that the Cover Story of Judge and Caesar discussing getting rid of Vegapunk is nothing more than the aforementioned “Red Herring” - **It’s the misdirect**. They are the obvious pick for the perpetrator but they have a good Alibi as to why it can’t be them.\n\nIt is possible that it will be revealed Judged planned on getting rid of Vegapunk even before the whole Whole Cake Island ordeal so I wouldn’t be counting this possibility out. I still think that whoever kidnapped Vegapunk and is trying to kill his Satellites is connected to MADS, be it Caesar and Judge or not.\n\n# Credits\n\nA lot in this post was taken from [*21 Popular Mystery Tropes for Writers*](https://www.writersdigest.com/write-better-fiction/popular-mystery-tropes-for-writers) written by Lee Brewer, a Senior Editor of *Writer's Digest*.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11ouyys/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_law_in_whatever/",
        "text": "Part 9 of this \"What if\" series. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0nsehgqzb6na1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a17879a5b6083ea31a80b339bf87f76d2a769eb1\n\nIn my case, if anyone's curious: \n\nI wouldn't change much from how he was handled in Act 1 and 2 of Wano since I think Oda did a really good job with him there. The only thing I'd include was him actually contributing to the prison break in some way after Luffy lost to Kaidou, knowing full-well that Luffy is one of the strongest parts of this alliance. You could set up a way where he and (parts of) the Heart Pirates plan their own attempt at breaking Luffy out, but perhaps since they talked with Kanjuro and the others about it, they end up in prison. That way we actually get to see how Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin ended up as hostages, as well as this acting as yet another point for Law as to why he ends up breaking up this alliance, given that he was betrayed in this instance. \n\nAside from that, things stay pretty much the same for the rest of the first two Acts until the Raid begins. Maybe you could have a scene where he reacts a bit more in detail to Kanjuro's betrayal, given how he was directly betrayed by him as well in this scenario, but not much else changes until the battle on the Rooftop begins. There however I would keep the fight as a 4 VS 2 (and later a 3 VS 2) against the two Emperor after Zoro managed ot scar Kaidou and Law sent him down. Law leaving Luffy behind on the roof was a really stupid decision and didn't really make any sense, at least in my opinion. I'd actually make it that they all stay on roof, only to end up getting defeated in a very same way to how Luffy was knocked off of Onigashima by Kaidou in the real story. \n\nI already mentioned this in Part 2 of this \"What if\" series, but I'd make it so that Bepo catches Law before he falls into the ocean for good and brings him back to the floating island where he then lays him down somewhere outside the Skulldome for some rest. There, Law could have some moment of self-doubt where he thinks that, since Luffy has been knocked down the island as well, and since none of their attacks seem to work, fighting the Yonko is meaningless. But remembering that his crew, the Straw Hats, and the samurai are still giving their all, despite the captains' defeat makes him regain his battle spirit. \n\nSo when Luffy flies past him on Momo and stretches out his hand to carry him with him to the Rooftop, Law declines and instead teleports up there again with his Devil Fruit ability. Once there, the fight against the two Emperor continues and Law shows some new skills, be that simply the Awakakening of his Devil Fruit or also some Haki stuff, given how he regained his fighting spirit in this \"dream version\" of mine. It's said that Haki grows stronger when fighting against strong opponents, so I wouldn't find it too weird for Law to have learned Advanced Armament Haki after his first loss against Kaidou/Big Mom there. In case you're not the biggest fan of that idea, given how it could make him more of a traditional swordfighter similar to Zoro, I could also see a moment where he, Luffy, and Kid end up blocking a second Hakai from Big Mom and Kaidou in a very similar way to how the OG 3 Admirals blocked Whitebeard's shockwave on Marineford. This could then be all the hint of Law's skill in Haki for the entire Arc and the rest of his fight focuses on his Devil Fruit. This could also serve as a first hint at both Kaidou and Big Mom getting weaker or the three Supernova being an actual threat to them as they took the full force of that attack much better than Zoro did (on his own mind you) the first time. From here on out, the fight goes on relatively chaotic. Maybe you could include a moment where Law mentions Joy Boy and Kaidou visibly perks up at that, so Law decides to prioritize him first since he wants answers, giving Luffy and Kid the opportunity for some moments together against Big Mom. Law continues using his Devil Fruit Power to throw Big Mom and Kaidou off and later teams up with Kid to take on Big Mom alone, be that because out of his own accord or because they just \"fell\" to the Live Floor because of an attack or something. \n\nIn the end, Law and Kid take out Big Mom. Doesn't matter if that includes the bombs or not since, if done right, you could have also included a number of times where Luffy had hit her, so the readers who think that Luffy thinks is stronger than Kid and Law can still say that most of her damage was because of him. If you're really bold, you could also include a scene where he, Kid, and maybe the other characters from Wano then hold Kaidou in place during Luffy's last attack with a massive chain or so around his neck. At the very least, this gives more meaning to the phrase \"If it's a 1 VS 1, always bet on Kaidou\" since Luffy wasn't alone when he landed that last punch, everyone else helped him there. The Arc then ends for him pretty much in the same way it did in the actual manga. \n\nWay more ambitious than some of my other \"What if\" scenarios so far, but I really think that Law had seriously missed potential in this Arc. \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10suysq/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_hawkins_in/) \\- Hawkins\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10v431h/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_the_kid_and/) \\- Kid and Heart Pirates\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10x4ha4/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_orochi_in/) \\- Orochi\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10yw5h6/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_zoro_in/) \\- Zoro\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/111isx9/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_yamato_in/) \\- Yamato\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11b1wt7/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_franky_in/) \\- Franky\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11icj17/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_tama_in/) \\- Tama\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11m7dkj/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_nami_in/) \\- Nami",

        "text": "I don't think I'm going to say anything new here, but Sanji is tied for [my least favorite strawhat](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/vpakgx/ussop_is_not_relatable/) these days. He peaked in Baratie, in my opinion. I think he's got what could be the coolest fighting style in the strawhats, and i love his anime voice actor. In Baratie, I think Sanji was my favorite character at the time, but here are some examples of sanji losing me more and more over the years. He used to be suave, and a ladiesman, and progressively got more insufferably perverted and gross and that's only part of the problem.. \n\n# [Protecting Nami in Arlong Park](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_76_05.jpg)\n\nThis is was relatively minor offense, but it kind of irked me that Nami had just told everyone that Ussop was dead and she betrayed them. Zoro went to charge her (and I doubt actually kill her), but Sanji cuts in and says that Zoro isn't a real man for attacking a woman. I find this very silly. And this isn't because I think it's silly to defend a woman at any time. In fact, [this scene is](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_146_16.jpg) one of my favorite rescues from Sanji. So despite how silly I thought the Arlong Park stuff was, Sanji made up for it throughout the rest of Arlong Park and definitely in Drum Island. My love for him was restored back to 100%.\n\nBut this moment in Arlong Park was the beginning of a long trend of personally disappointing scenes from Sanji. Attacking Zoro for charging Nami who had implied she killed Ussop or helped Ussop get killed, is directly in contradiction [to this scene](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_114_11.jpg) as well, where he rushed to hold a gun to Robin's head.\n\n# [Sanji's Fight with Mr.2](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_188_06.jpg)\n\nNow after Sanji figured out how to get around Bon Clay's powers, this fight becomes one of my favorites in the series, especially in the anime. I was especially impressed with Sanji's ability to treat Bon Clay with respect after the fight was over and offer his acknowledgement. But the fact that transforming into Nami was a weakness at all was so stupid to me. I would've respected sanji more if he didn't have to work around that kind of thing all, but it was a moment to show Sanji's keen observation and ability to work around a disadvantage. So it's a mixed bag. \n\nYou probably have an idea of how sanji reacts when he sees an attractive woman now, but [this is](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_239_13.jpg) how he would respond in the old days. Much more chill. Again in most of alabasta and in Skypeia Sanji was great and one of my favorites, but the ridiculousness was starting to ramp up.\n\n# [Sanji vs Khalifa](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_403_02.jpg)\n\nThe most egregious yet. Sanji had been incredible in this arc up til this point, but knowing that Robin's life is on the line and not even subduing the enemy in front of you was so bad to me. I know of his childhood trauma, but it's a character flaw that the story doesn't force him to work on. He's always miraculously bailed out. He knows what the stakes are, and he could easily knock this woman out, but refuses. Nami is right as she chastises him, but also praises him. And that's my problem. The story recognizes this as a character flaw for sanji, but also as a great part of his character. I think it's only a flaw that needs to be worked on. And once he did this, unlike nami, my respect for him went way fucking down. \n\n# [Sanji Confirmed Creep](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_464_08.jpg)\n\nDuring his fight with Absalom, the thing that makes him most upset is that he no longer has the ability to fulfill his dream of spying on naked women in bath houses...This just isn't funny to me. This is bad. I don't care what cultural background leads to this kind of humor, I don't like it. I have no control over how sanji is written. So there's no point in me pretending like I can or that the story was made with my morals in mind. I can't, and it wasn't. But I can still react to this. And my reaction is that this is awful. All respect I have for sanji as a person at this point go even more down. I appreciated him for wanting to lay down his life for the crew when Kuma stormed the scene, but that doesn't change that he's a creep.\n\n# Sanji in Fishman Island Nosebleeds\n\nDo I even need to say anything about this? Stupid plot line from Oda all around. I get why sanji was more sensitive after the time skip, but this was not the way to tell that story in my opinion. Sanji is now becoming more of a gag character than a character. The nosebleed scene in the Wano bathhouse was also egregious to me.\n\n# [Sanji Tells Jinbe to Kill Himself](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_627_18.jpg)\n\nSanji had the audacity to tell Jinbe, one of the least problematic characters in the series, to kill himself as an apology to Nami. Sanji seems to be pretty emotionally intelligent most of the time, but this was wild. After Jinbe had poured his heart out in a humbling and self effacing way, Sanji says Jinbe should kill himself because it'll make Nami feel better. This is an L for two reasons. It demonstrates a general stupidity but also a complete ignorance on who Nami is, the person Sanji seems to be most obsessed with. \n\n# Sanji's Disregard for Kids or Men or Strangers at Times\n\nIf you're not a woman that Sanji is attracted to, he talks to people crazy lol. This is maybe a relatively minor thing, but it gets worse as the series progresses. [He shouts at a bunch of clearly vulnerable kids and tells them to shut up.](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_658_03.jpg) A lot of people like to say Sanji is the kindest strawhat, but [I just don't think that's true.](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_658_08.jpg) Like many characters in one piece, he's showed a disregard for people and their wellbeing at times when[other characters show more compassion](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_658_11.jpg). He'll race to rescue Tashigi, an actual declared enemy, but won't go out of his way to protect kids unless Nami asks him too. Now you remember that he rushed to save Toko in Wano, but that was because [he knew her already.](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_943_21.jpg) Nami was willing to save kids she didn't know. I think there's a ton of examples of Sanji being kind, but his disregard for others at times is shockingly unkind a lot of the time too. \n\n[Like when he tells Ussop to keep Nami safe for him?](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_991_07.jpg) They're both comparably weak, and at this point you could say Nami is superior to Ussop. So why is he saying this shit to Ussop, rather than \"good luck, you too\" or something affirming of both of them?\n\n# [Sanji Confirmed Creep Pt. 2](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_663_13.jpg)\n\nNot cool, man. Not Cool. I mean, [look at this shit](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_663_15.jpg).\n\n# [Sanji and Violet](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_703_11.jpg)\n\nViolet could've probably convinced a lot of people to help her, but of course it was Sanji. What happened to, like when the kids needed help, his idea that they're not a charity and won't be helping random strangers? When it's a hot woman begging for his help, though, he's all for it. And the story rewards him for this. Violet did need help. Sanji doesn't have to work on being duped by women, because it'll work out for him. Even while getting the shit kicked out of him, or maybe cause he's getting the shit kicked out of him, he's only thinking about perverted shit. How did he even get locked in chains? You're telling me they made chains that could hold Sanji? I think the CoO specialist shouldve been able to avoid that, even if he was jumped. \n\n# Losing Situations\n\nOda keeps putting Sanji in this punching bad scenarios, situations where he can't actually come out on top. or not giving him the hype that he deserves. There's a ton of examples, only a few listed below.\n\n* Why not make his bounty to the point where he couldve been a supernova in sabaody?\n* Why put him up against Doflamingo?\n* Why have him lured and beaten up on by Black Maria? I don't care that he's grown from Kalifa and actually asks Robin for help this time. This isn't a situation he should need help in. This isn't the kind of growth I'd prefer, because it's not a real change in character. He didn't have access to help in Enies Lobby when he fought Kalifa, but in Wano he was in a War with countless allies all around him.\n   * This is right after he complains to the Beast Pirates for not taking him seriously and recognizing him as Black Leg Sanji. \n   * He also says he's going to join luffy on the roof, but gets distracted by someone woman he doesn't know.\n   * AND after [telling luffy to conserve his strengt](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/opctcb/onepiece/onepiecechapters_993_08.jpg)h and focus on Kaido.\n\n# His Dream\n\nSanji has a dream for all blue that he never talks about anymore. Why isn't this dream being developed at all? I was really interested in it when he first brought it up. He could've been mentioning a search for it all this time but it never comes up. Whatever All Blue theories you subscribe to, you admit to admit that.\n\n# The Slave\n\nSanji argued with a cloud about who was Sanji's servant. Sanji met Stussey and immediately offered to be her dog. This is not the suave and cool man we met in Baratie. \n\n# His Powers\n\nThis might not bother any of you, but I'm not a fan of magic science so much. I'd rather it just be magic, so it was disappointing that Sanji's powerups were kind of an accidental discovery of abilities programmed into him. You could compare that to devil fruits, but I think the average devil fruit requires more awareness and skill to use effectively than just being bionically strong and regenerative. \n\nAlso, why did Sanji use the Raid Suit? He said he never would, but seemed pretty easy to convince himself to use it to mask his identity. But he didn't this kind of help when it came to speed blitzing Oven in WCI. Could the story not have been written that Sanji did a similar feat to ward of Page 1 and or Drake? Would that be hard to believe? Or did it make more sense for him to just start using the suit? I don't think so. \n\nI understand that he's mixing his haki with his body's magic science, but I prefer it less than other power up ideas people had in mind for Sanji.\n\n# Sanji and Zeff\n\nYou might think that all of this woman stuff is excusable because of Zeff. I don't. I have answers for this, but this all pretty long as is. But I will say, nothing that I criticize Sanji for is a misunderstanding of his character. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nSanji has done a lot of amazing things for the story. Many of my favorite moments are because of him. But the same is true for many of my least favorite moments. It's made me like him less and less over time. I don't think he's uniquely more kind than anyone else. I don't like the direction his powers took. I don't like his whole thing with women. I don't like that he doesn't get a lot of Ws, more so does the rescuing (often at his expense). \n\nThere's so much more to say, but I'll leave it at this: Many of you may think I'm just nitpicking or misunderstanding him, or not allowing grace because of cultural differences. I can address all of that, but I think I have good reasons regardless for liking Sanji less and less as time goes on.",

If it's really model Nika he should have been able to enter that form from the start so he'll have his base form, his hybrid form and his Nika form. I'd say Gear fourth is the closest to hybrid form and gear 2 and 3 are just useful implementations of his base form. Also the fact that his base form is already rubber is unlike all other Mythical Zoans we've seen.",

        "text": "As the youngest member of the D. clan fell to the ground on onigashima far beyond the veil of their world and our world on a chair shaped like a small sun a god watched his favorite mortal perish to the club of the azure dragon. His everlasting grin did not waver, how could it? The fun was just about to start! The other gods did not see it this way, they simply thought the sun god had chosen the wrong inheritor of his will. Several of them were even preparing to accept the young man’s soul into the afterlife but then the eternally grinning god reached into his burning throne and pulled out an old drum.\n\nAnd he began to play. For the first time in over 800 years the sound of drums were heard throughout the heavens. And oh what a joyous song it was! It was so freeing, any who heard it couldn’t help but smile and join in. The gods remembered what he had promised long ago, when the drums were once again played liberation was soon at hand. And so they grabbed their instruments and joined in as one. All Nika did was laugh and dance as Monkey D. Luffy’s heart began to beat in rhythm with the sun gods mighty drum. His grand laugh rumbled like thunder and grew in intensity as the strawhat wearing man grabbed a lightning bolt before hurling it like he would throw his own spear.\n\nAfter the battle was over the song came to an end but the gods knew this was only the beginning. The long horrible night that had begun over eight centuries ago was coming to an end and the first rays of the morning sun peaked through the darkness. Three tyrants fell in wano that night, and many more were soon to follow. A new emperor was crowned, and Joy Boy had returned.",
