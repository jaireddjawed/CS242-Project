        "text": "Up front, I'm going to be honest with you all.  I f'ing despise Postmodernism with a glowing, red hot ember of malevolence which lies somewhere between chilling disdain and seething disgust.   In my opinion, it is a circle jerk of grammar and linguistic games and the failure to slay the Buddha when he was found along the path.  Postmodernists, instead, sat down with him and shared a week of meals.\n\nThat may well be due to how it was first introduced to me - through Donna Haraway's \"Primate Visions.\"  As people in my class mounted heaps of praise on this book, I became increasingly convinced that there was something wrong with me, because all I wanted to do was hurl this tome across the room and to make a dent with it.  Then, I discovered that it wasn't just me.\n\nAs  Matt Cartmill said,   \n\nThis is a book that contradicts itself a hundred times; but that is not a criticism of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This is a book that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics.\n\nThis is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.\n\n This is a book that clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; but that is not a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and refreshing to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science. \"\n\nBut, by that time, I had come to bemoan the future of anthro, assuming this massive ego-gratification by that author marked the future of the science.  I picked up a computer science degree and only occasionally looked back.  As I did so, I saw only confirmation that I had made the right choice as cultural anthropology became mired in a thicket of questions like whether and to what extent it should embrace science - a thicket which never produced anything actually constructive.  Then, there was the Sokal hoax.\n\nNow, I get and support the notion of social constructivism, but that doesn't require Postmodernism.\n\nI knew one thing.  I simply did not and do not have the patience for the level of ego gratification found in Postmodern texts.\n\nMy question is, has anthropology found it's way back out of this intellectual wasteland yet?  What are the current paradigms which are moving into new ground?",

He was on the frontlines, in fact I believe he went behind enemy lines, as apart of recon or something. He told me stories about the horrible stuff he saw and never wants me to serve, he’s also a victim of the US’s use of the toxic agent orange chemical during the war. \n\nKeep in mind they are not married.

I've read that many divine battles in myths and legends were actually competitions between different people groups and their chief deities. Such as mesopotamian gods that were patron gods of their capital cities (marduk of babylon, enlil of nippur, anu of uruk...) and when some city gained power over the others, their god became the chief god of the region and the others are seen as lesser gods.\n\nCould the titans and giants be long forgotten deities of unknown origins that were subjugated by arriving peoples and merged traditions? Or they were just a story that came to existence the same time current gods (zeus, thor...) did to legitimize their right to be the true gods?",

The idea of numbers, even basic ones, were (allegedly) beyond their basic comprehension. When asked how many brothers someone had, the Afghan solider could not give an answer in the form of a number, but would instead list the names of their brothers.\n\nI would give an exact quote, but I'm afraid I listened to this on audiobook. I found the following quote via Goodreads that came from the same chapter: “Almost all Afghan recruits had been deprived of a basic education during their country's decades of turmoil. An estimated 80 to 90 percent could not read or write. ***Some could not count or did not know their colors***. Yet the Americans expected them to embrace PowerPoint presentations and operate complex weapons systems.” (emphasis added).\n\nThis got my head spinning. Before the writing down of abstract numbers, did people simply never use abstract numbers in their lives?\n\nI'm reminded of how the Romans did not have a ZERO, and how the Ancient Greeks (allegedly) could not see the color BLUE.\n\nI'd be fascinated to hear if scholars have looked into this intersection between abstract numbers and literacy.\n\nThanks!",

As in is there a theoretical mechanistic framework that describes how, why and from what influences are religions formed. Is there something I can read on this?\n\n2.) How did the abrahemistic religions come about - as in what influenced the genesis of Judaism/ monotheism. I am roughly aware of how the three abrahamistic religions describe it themselves, but I would be interesting in a more scientific explanation - if there is any?\n\n3.) Basically the same as in 2.) but for Buddhism, it seems to be such a big outlier in it's inert concepts to everything else.\n\n4.) Nordic religion:  \na.) I have had the impression sometimes that the aesir are not of nordic origin. is that a possible read, as in that they were maybe imported, assimilated from somewhere else?\n\nb.) There is a kind of synchronicity between e.g. Odin hanging on yggdrasil with his spear and jesus hanging on the cross and the aftermath of that. is that coincidental? is that influence of christianity already? and considering that those kind of thematical repetition between religions is not unique to this example, is there a name for this? is there a way to tell whether themes developed independent because they are compelling (like convergent evolution), or are direct assimilation from other cultures/religions?  \n\n\n5.) lastly: I have often read the theory that pantheistic religions are an evolutionary step, that is predated by something more simpler, where basically everything was venerated, be it tree, stone or animal. Is there actual evidence of that? Considering that a pantheon can already be shown for sumer, how far back are we talking?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry long post, but I am really curious.\n\nIf you can point me to something where I can read up myself, it would be very welcomed.\n\nAnyway guys, thanks to everybody who answers :)",

        "text": "I've seen a few articles recently regarding human olfaction and how it's generally been underestimated thus far. It's gotten me thinking more consciously about my own sense of smell and I'm curious as to what potential uses it could have if I lived as a hunter-gatherer.\n\nDoes anyone know if modern humans (or other hominins) have ever used the smell of animal waste, or whatever other strong odors you'd smell at a zoo or ranch, to sense if predators or prey are nearby? If so, could a person come to associate smells from prey animals with food and find them pleasant (like scents wafting from a restaurant) as a result? Or possibly associate certain ones with predators and avoid them because of that? \n\nI think I can usually smell if farm animals are nearby pretty easily, but I'm not sure if this is only because their waste collects in one area. I don't completely hate the way they smell despite it being rather pungent, but I also wouldn't call it pleasant. I know food &amp; scent preferences can vary widely by culture and individual though.\n\nI'm allergic to cats and I associate the smell of a litterbox with the discomfort of my allergies. But I know people without cat allergies usually dislike the smell as well. I often wonder if this specific odor sensitivity, or my allergies, are at all related to hominins being hunted by felids.\n\nIt just seems to me like there should be a reason why we're so sensitive to smells like cat and chicken waste and they're so easily identifiable. Any relevant information about human olfaction and ecology is appreciated. Or if anyone has evidence that we're only sensitive to animal waste odors because of something like dangerous bacteria that would be appreciated as well.",

(But my parents and sister told me it is more common but not so much more and that sexism is not about hating women nor seeing them as lesser inferior beings, that it's about men having had the roles of power, because they were stronger so exerted strength to get them, etc. But that women were also thought to have a just as important role, in the home.)\n\nI believe it's thought that women like men as a gender more than men like women as a gender due to this. Because people think sexism means mistreating, hating, etc. And that it's thought women treat men better and with more respect.\n\nI believe it's thought that women like men in a more well rounded way than men like women, because of sexism and because because people think men objectify women and that if you took sex away... men would prefer men in all other ways (they think women are unfunny, they think that men are superior, etc.)\n\nI believe it's thought that sexism towards men is only a thing as backlash against sexism towards women. So women who hate men hate them for how men treat women.\n\nI believe traditional roles are not seen as equal but different and are instead seen as representing a belief that women are incapable and to serve men. \n\nI believe that when men do typically female hobbies and jobs women propel them to success and praise them for the bare minimum (which they wouldn't do for a woman with the same skills), like drag queens and gay male makeup artists. But women doing typically male jobs or hobbies are held to higher standards, have to prove themselves more, are not given the same support and are even verbally abused (Female gamers, female Mps, in sport, etc.) And that there are boy's clubs that are hostile towards women in male dominated workplaces, but not girl's clubs that are hostile towards men in female dominated workplaces.\n\nI believe it's thought that women hate each other, get jealous, compete and have internalised misogny, but that men have stronger bonds, friendships and camaraderie. (Even though my psychologist told me that it's instead believed that women mostly support each other.)\n\nMy parents and sister told me I was wrong about all of these things and that most people don't think these things, my sister identifies as a feminist herself. But I asked this on this very subreddit and they said my beliefs are \"extremely common.\" And everybody on here tells me this whenever I have asked. Why the contrast?

Like, if you look at the way an American politician or millionaire thinks, dresses, and acts, it’s super different from the way an American who makes like 40k a year thinks, dresses, and acts. It’s kind of hard to subscribe, but if you’ve ever interacted with a weather person of your own culture and than a poorer person of a similar culture, you often have more in common with the poorer person of that similar culture. Like, both an American and a Canadian who make 40 grand a year are virtually identical, but an American who makes 40 million dollars a year dresses differently, they speak differently, they eat different food, and they display different thought patterns. And it’s not like you can just give some rando 40 million dollars and have them gain the cultural affects of the American upper classes. Like, lottery winners don’t act the same way people who made there money over time or people who where born with it, suggesting that having enough wealth for enough time is basically enough to make you switch to a different cultural group.\n\nI guess I’m asking why Anthropology lumps all of these visibly distinct cultures together as part of unilateral cultural groups rather than like, interacting sub-societies that have sort of colonized eachother.",

I plan to start with this, but there are only so many Spanish courses I can take.  \n\nTL;DR - What types of courses would be helpful to take in preparation for an Anthropology, MA/PhD program (possibly wayy) in the future?\n\n(Also I read the rules and some threads re: the rules, but I’m not sure if this violates them or not.

Also, it apparently was not inherited as a result of Sub-Saharan Africans mating with Neanderthals but as a result of Sub-Saharan Africans mating with modern humans from Eurasia who themselves had mated with Neanderthals or whose ancestors had done so. This mating supposedly happened over the past 20,000 years ([Source](https://www.science.org/content/article/africans-carry-surprising-amount-neanderthal-dna)).\n\nIt's obviously unlikely that Eurasians transferred only Neanderthals' DNA to Sub-Saharan Africans; they must have also transferred their homo-sapien-sapien DNA. This leads me to ask, _Did Sub-Saharan Africans have Homo Sapiens Sapiens' DNA and morphology before this mating occurred?_ Also, _What was the morphology of Sub-Saharan Africans before this mating?_ \n\nRecall that it was revealed a few years ago that Sub-Saharan Africans have DNA from a ghost hominid that comprises 2% to 19% of our DNA ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51508616)).\n\nDid Sub-Saharan Africans have a completely archaic, non-homo-sapien-sapien morphology before mating with Eurasian modern humans?\n\nI've read that the oldest fully modern human (homo sapien sapien) skeletons found were Cro Magnons, which were discovered in Europe (West Eurasia), and that no fully modern human remains have ever been found in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nBy the way, I am well aware of the Out of Africa Theory; I believed in it, but now I'm not so sure.",

The average height of a young men in many Southern European countries reaches 5’10. This is likely due to the fact that the humans that settled there didn’t have an ideal protein diet for a long time, and were naturally stunted genetically.\n\nThe same could be said for Japan, which has a healthy population, but low protein consumption on average, leaving them around 4inches  shorter overall than the Netherlands.\n\nCould the Gravettian culture give a glimpse of what the healthiest and strongest humans can be since they likely had an abundance of protein (hunting megafauna) for centuries?

She thought that humans naturally organized their life around a central vocation, and would not be able to simply stay happy without a larger purpose to pursue. I argued that this attitude is not necessarily common among humans, but only seems to be universal because of how much western culture and ideology prevails over the modern world.\n\nWe moved on to talk about the history of different civilizations throughout history, since my sister claimed that the vast majority of them, even outside of the west's influence, were driven by a 'vocational' attitude. My counterpoint was that cultures with a vocational attitude would naturally become expansionist, since excess populous in such a culture would become restless and look outwards to find a 'life's purpose', emigrating and spreading their world view. I argued that there were plenty of civilizations that *didn't* focus on living to work, but... a lot of what I was saying was made up on the spot.\n\nMy questions are, do you think human's naturally tend to 'live to work', or do they tend to just 'live and be strange' without purpose? And, why do you believe one side or the other? Are there *actually* many examples of 'live and be strange' cultures/civilizations, or no?\n\nI remember learning that certain native American tribes weren't vocational, and the same was the case for local Hawaiians before the island was colonized, but I haven't been able to find any sources to back up those claims.",

        "text": "\\*N.B.: I am aware that the dominant religions of the Post-Classical era are very different to those that existed during the dawn of civilisation, so I am not referencing any by name. What is important to my question is that religion is characterised as dogmatic, communal and authoritative (i.e.: a small tribe writing mythology to explain natural phenomena does not count as religion for the purposes of my question. An entire society believing in a common dogma and explanation for the universe, with the institution prescribing the dogma having some authority in said society, is what I am characterising religion as. \n\nI am, in general, an anti-theist; I believe in the modern era, dogmatic religion has not only done significantly more harm than good, but that belief in a God, unsupported by evidence or the scientific method, actively impedes and is impeding progress in society. I also believe, in the oft-quoted line from Marx, that \"religion is the opium of the people\". Today, I believe religion, insofar that it is based on faith and dogma, is an impediment to social progress. \n\nHowever, if religion is indeed \"the opium of the people\", could this rationale for its harm not also be reversed? In that it allows societies to be organised in stable hierarchies and facilitates the formation of States, and by extension, peace, compared to the intensely violent lifestyles of most hunter-gatherer tribes. \n\nIs this legitimate reasoning? Was religion instrumental in the formation of organised civilisation?\n\nI understand that this is a complex question to answer, insofar the formation of religion AND the formation of the State and organised hierarchies following the dawn of agricultural surplus can be characterised as a natural byproduct of humanity and human social evolution, and isolating causality between one and the other is very difficult (if there even is a causal link). \n\nI guess my question could be reframed as \"(To what extent) did dogmatic religion stabilise early human civilisations, and was religion instrumental in the progression and evolution of civilisations and States into the modern era, insofar that religion acted as a stabiliser?\"\n\n(Of course, the modern era would see the start of the very slow but accelerating decline of religion punctuated by junctures to its authority like the French Revolution, and I do think the decline of religion faciliated \"the Constrained Leviathan\" (in the words of Acemoglu and Robinson) and liberal democracy, although if alternative views exist here I am happy to read them too). \n\nFinally, any recommended readings on this topic would be welcome.",

        "text": "In most of the Western world, the path of a man and woman to becoming married typically begins with a relatively casual, informal encounter between them. After this informal encounter, the man and woman begin engaging in dating activities and begin referring to each other as “boyfriend” or “girlfriend”. This relationship is initiated by the couple themselves and organized by the couple themselves. The interpersonal chemistry and intimacy between the man and woman gradually grows throughout the duration of the dating process. At the couple’s discretion, the man and woman may or may not include sexual intercourse as a part of their dating process. Whether or not the couple have sex while dating is usually of little concern to anyone else beside themselves. If things between them don’t work out, they informally break up; if things do work out, the man, of his own accord, will likely ask the woman to marry him. Whether and when they get engaged is entirely at the discretion of the couple themselves. The choice of the couple getting married is typically based on their mutual chemistry and love for one another.  \n\nThis is more or less the custom of romantic courtship that most of the developed world is familiar with. But it’s my understanding that this custom is not the way it has always been. From ancient times, it appears that arranged marriage was the norm for how a man and woman got involved in a romantic relationship that would lead to marriage. Typically, a bachelor or his parents would go to the parents of the woman that the bachelor wanted to marry and would offer the woman’s parents a bride-price. (Or alternatively in some cultures, the parents of a woman would offer a payment of dowry to the family of a bachelor to give away their daughter in marriage to the bachelor.) The beginning of the relationship was arranged largely from outside the couple by family members of the couple, rather than the man and woman directly choosing each other. The initial encounter between the man and woman appears to be more formal and organized. After the bride-price or dowry is paid and the man and woman are now betrothed, a marriage date between them is planned upon. Often the man and woman know each other very little, if at all; thus there is often little or no real chemistry or romance between them at the time of marriage. The couple get socially acquainted with each other after their marriage instead of before. The woman is often forbidden from fornicating, and is expected to maintain her virginity while still a maiden, and only give up her virginity to her betrothed as a consummation of their marriage. This preservation of her virginity ensures that her husband’s eventual heir is genuine and will be able to carry on the husband’s bloodline. Furthermore, the woman’s virginity is of great concern to her parents, as the betrothal of a virgin daughter will fetch a higher bride-price for the family; alternatively, a non-virgin daughter may be of far less value, if she can even be married away at all. The betrothal between the man and woman is essentially a formal monetary transaction between the families of the man and woman. The couple’s relationship has less of a romantic purpose and more of a social purpose, involving the covenant between the two families in order to ensure a progeny and a family life for their respective son and daughter.\n\nHere’s my question: At some point in history the arranged marriage system became phased out in most of the developed world and was replaced by the more informal system of men and woman getting girlfriends and boyfriends, respectively. When did this happen? Why did this happen? What social or historical forces led to this change in how people engaged in romance?",
