        "text": "Good morning,\n\n  \nFor the future, I have a large interest, as do many others, in working for the FBI or other federal agency. Particularly my interest lies in working with or helping children in some way. Originally I wanted to become a Pediatric ER Doctor, but I think med school is out of the cards for me. Now, I am interested in pursuing perhaps something in the field of criminal justice in regards to protecting or finding justice for cases regarding child safety. I am also interested in counterterrorism. \n\n  \nLet's say hypothetically this was my experience:  \n\n\n* Bachelor of Science in *Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security &amp; Cybersecurity, Concentration in Emergency Preparedness*\n* Bachelor of Science in *Atmospheric Science*\n* 2-3 Years of Experience working professionally within my states homeland security division.\n* A masters degree.\n\nI guess my question lies with, if I were to apply with the above education and experience. Is there any particular masters degree you could recommend? Currently I am considering a masters in Emergency Management &amp; Homeland Security with a concentration in Security Risk Analysis. However, I have also considered receiving a graduate degree in Psychology or Criminal Justice as well.\n\nI have even considered a master's in child psychology given my interest in child safety, but my guess is that since you would be looking at the adults committing the crime, you would want a more general degree in psychology instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your time an help! Thanks!",

The university discourages outside work for any GRA but I don't think that the penalties of being caught would be any worse than stripping me of a small stipend and making me pay tuition for my final semester. I am highly considering working part time secretly as the real-world money that could be made the next 6 months is significant. Is there any manner in which this public university could figure out I have an outside employer? Or am I safe to secretly work? (Also, just as a disclaimer, my research would not suffer as a result of my side-hustle and there would be absolutely no conflicts of interest). \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!",

In my undergraduate degree, most of our critical essays and final papers focused on one text. I was only ever required to pull quotes and information from a single source. Now, in graduate school, my research topics are significantly broader, and require sometimes dozens of sources. I've found a note-taking system that works for me, and I've been great about creating annotated bibliographies. However, I'm starting to feel like I have a huge collection of quotes and interesting information, but no real way of linking my ideas in a way that makes sense. \n\nHow do you guys go about taking the sources and research that you have found, and fitting it together? I have bits of pieces from dozens of sources, but no real understanding of how to make the puzzle pieces fit. This has been by far, my biggest struggle so far this semester. \n\nHow do you guys do it? If you're writing a critical essay, how do you sift through all the research you have gathered? Do you store all your vital quotes in a single document/note? Do you create outlines? Mind maps? Do you use some sort of note-taking template? \n\nI feel embarrassed to ask this, because I feel like this is something so intuitive or something I should have figured out before this point -- but I find myself gathering more and more information, with no guidance on how to put it all together. \n\nI appreciate any help or advice you can offer me.",

However, much of my past employment history was with bosses that I did not like and have not kept in contact with (very condescending, not great leaders, actually the reason why I pushed so hard to become a leader myself) and my undergrad was many years ago, plus I was undiagnosed with ADHD at the time so my ability to produce assignments was much more limited at that time. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I am in need of one more reference. I was wondering if it would be appropriate to ask a former employee? They worked directly under me for years, was a mentee of mine and saw a lot of my work have direct positive impact on the company. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this? Would it be weird or does it seem appropriate?",

As such, I had my visa appointment scheduled late, which also contributed to why I couldn’t start on time. The typical student visa processing time for where my grad school is located is approximately 2 - 3 months.\n\nI’m scared that a similar problem would occur again once I re-apply for my student visa for the April 2023 semester. Could I request my grad school to send me my updated admission letter in advance to avoid the postal problem? And when should I make the request? Would next week be a good time?",

I am so tired I am falling asleep standing up and my chest is so painful.\n\nI hate this! I worry my supervisor will think I’m making it all up. Earlier this year I missed 3 months due to Covid, followed by a severely sprained ankle, topped off with another horrible infection.\n\nI am so anxious about missing time I am here at the lab hardly able to work. I took a Covid test and it was negative. I know I should be home in bed but I don’t want my supervisor to think I’m a whimp or some kind of weak link. Grad school is so fun",
