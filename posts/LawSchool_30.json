I was able to make friends with someone after my first week of classes, who introduced me o their group of friends that formed during orientation week. we’ve hung out a few times, like going out to lunch and bars, and usually chill in the library between classes. I know they have a groupchat with each other without me, and i’m not upset at that. same with them hanging out together at their apartments without me. I don’t expect to be completely integrated into this group, but i’d definitely like to be closer with them, ideally to the point where they can extend invitations to hang out outside of the library and the general vicinity of campus. thanks!",

        "text": "Long story short, I’m a non-traditional law student and I’ve worked a lot of jobs, went to three different colleges (two of which were community colleges and one big university) over the span of a decade. I’m taking ethics now &amp; they stressed the importance of having consistent law school applications &amp; c&amp;f applications. In panic, I checked my law school application and holy poo am I surprised I was even admitted with all of the misspelling and inconsistency. Anyways, I put on my application that I attended my undergrad institution for 4 years. Technically I attended for three years but at the time, for the sake of simplicity I put 4 years since it’s where I got my degree. I didn’t include my community colleges because I didn’t get degrees there. I also didn’t think it was a big deal because I genuinely couldn’t remember the exact dates I attended the other schools part time and figured it would all be on my transcripts anyways. Now I’m scared because I not only put that I attended for four years, but I also put the wrong grad year (a year after I really graduated). It was a genuine, albeit very careless mistake, and I wasn’t trying to hide anything. Before law school, I had no idea how important attention to detail was, nor how important it was to be 100% accurate in my disclosures. (Believe me, I want to slap myself too). \n\nI already amended my app once to include a traffic ticket that I didn’t think I needed to include from 2013 and correctly reflect employment history that included bartending jobs etc. (another thing I didn’t think they’d care to know) Now I just feel stupid amending again. How bad is this going to look for C&amp;F?\n\nLuckily - no criminal history, no plagiarism or anything weird with the schools. I had no reason to hide them, I was genuinely just a single mom working various part-time jobs and juggling school and a ton of other personal hardships. Those dates seem so blurry to me now, but I’m afraid C&amp;F won’t care. Other than looking like an incompetent dumbass, how bad is this going to be? \n\nAlso to my fellow law students &amp; lawyers, I promise I’ve learned the necessary organization and close-reading skills in law school to never make these mistakes again. Please don’t bully me. :(",

My grades said I earned a B (which was disappointing because I felt I did better than B work). I paid my tuition and started spring classes. Yesterday I went to the registrar to pick up my torts exam. They couldn’t find it in the stack. They said come back later. A few hours later in an email they said my exam was never graded, and they didn’t know how that B got entered into the system, and they will update me later today. So of course my mind is running wild with possibilities. Did they lose my exam? What will happen next? Whose B did I get? Will anonymity be broken? Will they stick me with a “middle of the road” grade to not upset the curve?  What if I am graded unfairly? The did the professor get in trouble with the administration? Will he take it out on me by giving me a lower grade? All of this anxiety is compounded because I am on a full tuition scholarship. I’ve asked a dozen lawyers if this ever happened to them, or if they ever knew anyone who this happened to. They said no. One of my friends said this really makes you question the integrity of their grading process. I’m freaking out, trying to hold it together so I can focus in Property right now.",

I already notified my soon to be employer about the discrepancy in my resume and actual employment dates, and it didn't seem to be an issue for them. \n\nHowever, I feel like it could be an issue with my law school.

I got my dream position, got the grades, and for a while was incredibly confident.   \n\nUntil I found out that one of my classmates was also summering at this firm.  This person is FUCKING.  GOOD.  Like top 5 students in our grade.  Published in our journal.  Older, more experienced, they’ve got it all.  \n\nDespite the past assurances from the firm, all I can think about is how I’m going to be completely swept away this summer and I won’t end up with an offer because of how incredible this other student is compared to me. It’s bringing back insecurities I thought I had shrugged off through hard work and discipline.  Quite literally, as far as metrics go, I am objectively worse than this student in everything.  And I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m gonna be thrown out in favor of a clearly shinier prospect.  \n\nIf anyone has felt this before, I’d appreciate some insights—todays been a bad one in terms of stress lol.\n\nThanks!",

I have been accepted to an LLM program in the UK in a niche field that I am interested in pursuing.  \n\nI'm not sure whether this would add value for me and I'm having a bit of trouble getting an answer to this question. I think this is partly because in many foreign programs Law is an undergraduate degree rather than a graduate degree? Most of the resources I have found are for international applicants who ultimately want to practice in the country of the LLM program, or for LLM programs within the US for JDs. My longterm intention is to live and practice in the US. Would it still add value for me to pursue the LLM program in the UK?  \n\nFor some more context my degree is from a good law school, though my work experience since graduating is a bit scattered and I have been having trouble breaking in to the niche field of interest. The main advantages I would be hoping for for is more area expertise/credibility, networking within the field, and  a reset for returning to the job market from an academic program.

The professor allowed students to pick from either a multiple choice final or a written question final. The exams were scored, and the average for the written answer final was much higher than the average for the multiple choice final. The assessments weren’t completely equal, as a result. The professor just plugged in the raw scores of the two exams and determined the curve. The students who took the multiple choice all got lower grades on the curve as a percentage while the written answer group took most the top spots. Don’t the averages need to be normalized before scores are combined this way? An average student who decided to take the multiple choice will now get a lower grade than a below average student who did the written response final. In fact, a student who takes the multiple choice will more likely get a lower score simply because they chose the multiple choice exam. I’m not sure what to do about this.",

I noticed these symptoms during my undergrad as well, but I was able to manage them and do well because success in my degree didn't really require us to do readings (though we were supposed to).\n\nWhat do I do, who do I go to to talk about this? For those with ADHD/ADD, do these experiences sound familiar?\n\nI have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and while I know these can also cause concentration issues, I feel like the concentration issues I am experiencing are beyond the scope of depression and anxiety.\n\nPlease help.

I do not want to disclose what it is, but it will require 6-8 weeks of recovery time in which I will not be able to go to work or school.\n\nI am currently in undergrad and initially planned to have this surgery done in summer of 2024. However, I recently found out I will be able to graduate sooner than expected, in spring 2024. I’d rather spend my summer working in order to start law school in fall 2024 with a good amount of money saved up. I’m currently living paycheck to paycheck and am unable to save given that most of my pay is going towards my tuition that isn’t covered by finaid, so my summer after graduation would be my chance to save.\n\nIf I do not get this surgery done in summer 2024 though, I was struggling to figure out when to do it because I do not yet have a firsthand experience of the workload of law school. Shouldn’t my summers between semesters be spent working? Is it necessary/recommended to get an internship in your 1L summer? Given the amount of recovery time, would it be better to wait until after I graduate law school? If that is the case, assuming that I am employed after graduation, my concern then is that it would reflect poorly on me to take 6-8 weeks off after only being recently employed? Or would that likely not matter to my employer given that it’s a surgery?\n\nHope this makes sense, any insight welcome.",

I’m sick but it’s more like a cold so I’m still trying to stay active and keep up with my readings even though I won’t be in class to go over them…..also this is my first time getting covid so any guidance is appreciated",

I’m looking to attend a part-time, weekend-based program. \n\nI have an engineering degree as well as an MBA (and my MBA was completed as a full time student while working as a parent agent at an Amlaw top 50 firm), with my MBA gpa being above the school’s median. I currently work in-house managing an extensive IP portfolio for a public company. \n\nMy plan is to explain that the degree of difficulty for my engineering degree is greater than the average bachelors degree, and that my success in the MBA program is indicative of success in a part-time law program. I also my touch on the difficulty of studying for and taking the LSAT as a working professional with my job, as both sittings came after unavoidable all-nighters for work. \n\nAny thoughts or tips on what to discuss or avoid would be greatly appreciated.",

I never thought I would be here posting this but I have driven myself crazy over the past few weeks worrying about character and fitness for the bar. I plan on speaking with a C+F attorney about these issues but any insight would be so appreciated. Originally, I didn’t think my C+F history was extensive or problematic, but the more I think the more I become convinced I am going to struggle getting past C+F. The things I’m worried about:\n\n-residence hall violation during undergrad for having alcohol in dorm while below the drinking age (3 years ago). Had a meeting with someone from campus health office as discipline.\n\n-poor attendance record during undergrad, which included being approached by professors concerned about my absences and meetings with advisors regarding the same. I was never put on any academic probation and never failed a class,  but this was a fairly consistent theme throughout college for me.\n\n-similar to the last one - tons of missing assignment deadlines in undergrad and turning work in late. Definitely was approached by professors on this issue but no probation or failed classes.\n\n-during undergrad, I was an RA in my dorm and was placed on probation by my supervisor for not completing assignments on time. This is after I was given a written warning for the same a few months prior. \n\n-during undergrad, questioned by campus police about an incident but was a case of mistaken identity and there was no follow up or discipline.\n\n-one speeding ticket\n\n-in high school, received in school suspension/detention numerous times for talking in class and other minor stuff\n\nAt any rate, I plan on disclosing to the fullest extent necessary, but I am wondering if any of these seem unnecessary to disclose or should be disclosed but will/won’t be an issue. I guess I’m just worried that the Board will view my undergrad record as evincing a pattern of a lack of diligence/reliability and that therefore I am not fit to practice. On the other hand, I have had a variety of internships (federal judge, big law and government) during law school where I performed my duties responsibly/timely and had stellar attendance - and I think if contacted those employers would speak positively about my reliability, work ethic and timeliness.\n\nIdk, please be brutally honest with me y’all.

        "text": "I'm talking about a situation where professors hand out ample practice exams with model answers of people who got A's. \n\nTo be honest, this is extremely helpful because it gives me a lot of room to practice and I can know what my professor is looking for.\n\nUnfortunately, there is just one issue - everyone else has access to this same information.\n\nI have found that law students are brilliant at finding out how to best work their exams to satisfy their professors. My worst grades have all come in classes where students know what professors want because professors have given them so much feedback from these past exams and model answers.\n\nI don't mean this to be a bad thing. I just find this to be really hard to overcome at times. The curve is tough enough but when you add an additional layer like this, I feel like you need to be near-perfect to even get close to an A.\n\nThoughts?",

Just grateful I found out during the drop/add period so I can rectify this situation. \n\nUgh",
