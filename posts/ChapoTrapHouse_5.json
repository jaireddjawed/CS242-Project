Maybe their politics are disgusting, but is it not just as disgusting to fantasize about beating up geriatrics and mentally ill virgin losers? They also constantly criticize 'liberals' for their perceived capitulation to conservatives mocking their lack of 'direct action' aka political violence seemingly unaware that democracy and civil society requires peaceful transitions of power. You can mock liberal comedians and late night hosts all you want, but they actually tackle the conservative problem in a socially acceptable way unlike radicals and their absurd dreams of bloody revolution.\n\nI love the comedy of Chapo but when they talk about violence they are painfully sincere and come across as extremist loons. Could we please get less of this in the future",
