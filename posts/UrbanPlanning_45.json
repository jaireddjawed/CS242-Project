I'm 23 years old, out of college for almost a year now, went to a top-15 liberal arts college and graduated with a degree in Political Science. I currently work for a nonprofit in DC that does government ethics research and litigation. It's a good job, but I've realized that I'm really most interested in urban politics, policy, design, law, etc. My office shares a floor with people who work on affordable housing issues, and I think their work is crazy interesting. They mostly have MPP degrees. I've talked to them a little bit about it, but I'm a bit at a loss for where to turn to next for advice. I figured this wasn't the worst place to start (but not end up, of course. I don't like to make life decisions based on reddit answers, but they can be helpful). So my questions are: is urban planning a good career? For the urban planners out there: what were your educational/career backgrounds before you got started in urban planning? Do you like your career and would you recommend it to a young person such as myself? For those who have pursued an MURP degree: was it a good investment? Did you enjoy it? Has it led you to a good career? And finally, where should I turn to next for some good advice?",

I am in great need of some advice.\nI know I like geography, maps, looking at masterplans, wondering around renovated streets/parks/plazas, thinking about how to improve public space, idealizing transport networks, reading through strategic documents from cities/regions. So after some research, I was able to divide my interest into 4 main areas:\n\n\n‚Ä¢\tUrban Planning: urban strategies, economic development of cities\n\n\n‚Ä¢\tSpatial Analysis: urban analytics, demographic analysis, urban cartography\n\n\n‚Ä¢\tUrban Design: masterplanning, street/junction design\n\n\n‚Ä¢\tTransport planning: transport modelling, cycling/pedestrian traffic modeling, network analysis, demand estimation.  \n\n\nSo, this is a pretty diverse set of topics, which makes me a little confused on which course to take. Since I have never worked in this sector, I guess the best approach would be to try to get a job that puts me in contact with all these areas, and then decide which one is best for me and get a formal degree. However, I am finding it extremely hard to get one of these jobs with my background, so I decided to get some training before continuing to apply for jobs. \n\n\nI was thinking I should go for a GIS/spatial analysis post-graduate diploma, since it provides me more technical skills and I think that would be more marketable to employers than getting a mostly theoretical urban-planning masters‚Äô degree (I already have a masters in economics and public policy). Besides, I can see how GIS skills can be applied in my other interest areas of urban and transport planning, so I would be able to apply to those jobs too. However, I am not sure if this path leaves urban design completely out of my future prospects.\n\n\nIf you are from this area or have some input, please help me out!\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

I've recently started looking for work after I graduate with my B.S. this coming December. However, everywhere I look, it seems that they want 1-5 years of experience on top of a B.S.... or a M.S. and 1 year experience.\n\nI was hoping that I could get my B.S. and leave school with ~$30k worth of debt, and find a job quickly making more than $22/hr so that I could easily afford to pay my fair share of the rent, utilities... etc (Live with my S/O).  Is this possible, or should I spend the extra ~$20-30k (loans) and get my M.S. while I'm here?\n\nIt just seems that entry level jobs for planning tend to be extremely challenging sounding, even for the $15/hr positions. \n\nI was wondering if someone with some experience in the field could give me some pointers about how to make better connections in the field, and maybe detail the typical work day of a City/Corporate/Business Land Use or Policy Planner.\n\nCheers!",

        "text": "Hi /r/urbanplanning\n\nWe talk often about the need for good transit, and talk less often about the money, but I'd love to hear your 2 cents about some real world implications. \n\nMy lovely city, Worcester Massachusetts, as a lackluster and insufficient transit authority that is in a death spiral. We are the second largest City in New England, but only \"city proper\". Our Metro is only at ~900k, smaller than Hartford, Providence, Springfield. As a result we have low density suburbs around teh city proper who *need* the bus service to the urban core but put a real financial drain on the system.\n\nWe *have* the density in the city. We were built around an extensive electric rail network, our Worcester Polytechnic Institute even had a lab *devoted* to urban rail. Our neighborhoods are largely in the same configuration as they were in the streetcar age. Wide streets lead from the core, or from one end of the city to another, leading to distinct and rather dense neighborhoods with commercial corridors. We have regular demand and more than that **We have 9 colleges and universities in the city proper and 12 within the metro area** we should be able to support a real bus system at least.\n\nBut in the face of level state funding, the RTA is in a death spiral. They're cutting hours and raising rates. No night service anymore, *barely* any weekend service.\n\nOur rail ridership into Boston is climbing steadily. Every time they add trains we fill them. We're now limited by rail capacity not interest. But that first/last mile of transit, getting to and from the station, is barely there.\n\nHow do we get out of a death spiral? Higher fares and less service definitely won't increase ridership. I don;t see a clear way out. ",

I stumbled upon this sub from one of the GIS courses I took in college and read a bunch of articles and realized it helped explain some of the underlying malaise I feel with American life. The having to drive everywhere, anytime I want to do something fun or see some friends, the same ugly strip mall with the same exact stores you see in every American city. I'm lucky to have a EU passport and lucky to  have traveled through Europe extensively so I've seen how things are done differently there, even in more modern cities, a small but not insignificant part of me has a desire to move to Europe.\n\nJust wondering from you guys who are experts and who know the trends and the numbers, what does the future hold for America development. It is trending towards something more sustainable or is sprawl and strips malls(sounds like a early 2000's emo band name) still the main thing. Just hoping for an interesting discussion and more enlightening articles with statistics that I can read, thanks for reading and appreciate any comments!",

        "author": "mrgrimmsby",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/7wtsgc/an_idea_for_promoting_architecture_in_cities/",
        "text": "Background: I am of the position that cities could be doing more to promote architecture and using the built environment to develop aesthetics and character for a city but there are a few problems with doing so. Most cities do employ visual guidelines but these are mostly there to prevent buildings from looking outright atrocious and they are generally minimal. Cities generally cannot enforce too strong of visual codes without it being a burden to developers and chasing them away from the city. Additionally when building public buildings, cities find it hard to justify putting forth additional expenditures for ambitious architectural projects when public funds could be better used for public services and vital infrastructure. Why would a city make for instance, an art noveau inspired library when it could just make a utilitarian box and use the saved money to make sure that the school district has enough for desks and textbooks? Raising taxes just to have nicer buildings is a bad idea, no way in hell that that would float politically. Urban design requires resources and we need a way to obtain those resources without foisting the cost onto developers or taking it away from services that need it more.\n\nMy idea is, what if cities set up architectural donation funding pools where citizens who wanted to see more ambitious architectural projects could donate money towards that end. The fund would build up until a major building project came along and the city could then offer the proceeds from the fund to subsidize the project in return for the developer going that extra mile. The city could bee planning a new civic building and decide to wait until the fund reaches a certain amount so that they could put it towards a facade. Or, you could implement this at any scale depending on the goals of the city and how much winds up being in the fund. You could have that art noveau library if the additional cost of doing so was carried entirely by those who wanted it. Many cities already have preservation foundations but this would be towards producing new architecture. \n\nFor example, say the city of Riverside has set up the fund and after two years managed to accrue $300,000 in the fund (yes its unrealistic but lets just say for the sake of argument). Then a developer comes in and starts making plans for a 7 story office building in downtown, planning to make a very standard glass box building but haven't started drafting yet. At this point the city could come in and say \"Hey, if you go ahead and change the design to having a stone/brick building in the mission style we will front you 300k for the added cost and you can keep anything left over\". Hopefully then the developer would take the deal and everyone goes home happy.\n\nThoughts? Is there anything I am missing about this? Maybe it has already been done and I just haven't been paying attention. I only recently got the basic idea for the concept so I'm still not entirely sure if it would work.",

Hopefully I didn't forget any, or many. I also [made a survey of them](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyO5E9iuNpFv3khMo0nyFTSAHOFZckXptDhzO_XivMbGnSKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link), because I'm interested which concerns are more important to people here and which are less important. Alternately, if you disagree with a concern, the survey includes voting options for that. Results are visible to all after filling out the survey.\n \nDid I miss any concerns? Which ones are most important to you? Whether or not you take the survey, I hope there's some good discussion here in the comments.\n\nHere's the list:\n\n1. Cities for the most part do not have room for shared vehicles. Not enough solo drivers will switch to shared vehicle service. \n\n2. Cities for the most part do not have room for shared vehicles, even if solo driving is reduced with some or all of: charging per mile driven, congestion zone charging, express lane tolling. \n\n3. Suppose larger shared vehicles hold six to twelve passengers and function like small buses but save time by making fewer stops. Most cities don't have room for them.\n\n4. Too many bus and rail users will switch to shared vehicles, resulting in still too many needed on the streets.\n\n5. Shared vehicles, even if eventually self-driving and incredibly safe to be around, are incompatible with walkable, bikable cities whose streets only have buses, rail, government vehicles and delivery trucks.\n\n6. Suppose rules, fees, and other changes discourage solo driving and shared vehicles can viably reduce congestion in some cities. Shared vehicles are still not good because cities will be limited from becoming more like Amsterdam or Oslo.\n\n7. Shared vehicles aren't environmentally friendly enough.\n\n8. The considerable, largely taxpayer-funded cost of providing excellent train, tram, and bus service is still less than maintenance costs for the additional street and freeway lanes shared vehicles need. Also indirect costs such as increased health care from people walking less. \n\n9. People won't stop taking solo Ubers and Lyfts, even if cities like Chicago change the current $1 fee on *all* Uber and Lyft rides into a $5 fee only on the solo rides and $0 on shared uberPOOLs, Lyft Lines or Lyft Line Shuttles. \n\n10. When demand is low, shared vehicles will circle blocks too much of the time and add congestion.\n\n11. Shared vehicles will be poorly regulated because of powerful business interests and not enough competent city officials. Counter-examples of cities with good regulation and government are not enough.\n\n12. Even if shared vehicles reduce congestion enough, space that could become parklets or better protected bike lanes will remain needed for parking and passenger loading.\n\n13. Autonomous shared vehicles are any of the following: a distraction, at least twenty years away, won't work when the public trashes or games them, not enough people will ever trust them enough to ride without a human driver.",
