I'm starting to wonder if the internet in general is getting more extreme, or did she actually start promoting something absolutely unreasonable?\n\nEverybody says the issue is her tweets: [https://twitter.com/jk\\_rowling?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\nI started asking around on the various discords I'm on, trying to get back into the loop. I do hear that she's transphobic and I'm not going to defend her or try to prove otherwise. She might be. However, I legitimately struggle to find anyone who'd point the finger at the exact thing she said that was so hurtful to everyone. Has anyone saved links to anything?\n\nWith how strong the discourse is and how extreme the opinions are, I would rather not side with anyone unless I can learn exactly what I'd be saying. I'm mostly interested because of the legacy thing. Hating on a video game that hundreds of people worked on because it's associated with someone seems a little far. Hence, I ask for precise context on why Rowling is so disliked.",
