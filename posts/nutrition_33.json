I don't currently have a cold and I'm trying to make this as general as possible. \n\nWhat is the best form of zinc, if supplementing, to achieve the reported effects on decreasing the duration and intensity of colds?\n\nI have been using PlusPharma Zinc Sulfate Heptahydrate 220mg with amazing results for years, but I just realized for the first time today that the product I use has gelatin capsules. I became a vegetarian several years ago and never thought to check.\n\nNow I'm looking for a vegetarian alternative. The 50mg zinc gluconate tabs from the drug store (basic CVS brand zinc supplements) were nowhere near as effective for me, yet [this article](https://www.livestrong.com/article/409076-which-form-of-zinc-is-best/) says that gluconate is more bioavailable than sulfate. \n\nIf that's the case, what is it about the sulfate caps I was taking that made them work so much better than normal zinc supplements? The bottle says they supply 50mg zinc from 220mg of zinc sulfate heptahydrate, which is the same amount of zinc indicated on the CVS brand.\n\nWhat do y'all take for colds?",

I heard that sugar makes it worst so fruit juice or anything of that nature is off the table but what about other drinks like vegetable juice or water? Beyond the taste, is there anything that might help even very slightly mitigate the negative health effects of alcohol? Just hypothetically as far as what we know about nutrition hypothetically.\n\nAgain, not asking for something that makes hard liquor \"good for you\" I know very well how bad it is, just asking if anything might help even ever so slightly with the health risks like say I mix each drink half liquor and half water (or any other healthy drink), would it change how my body is affected after drinking a full bottle that way compared to straight hard liquor?",
