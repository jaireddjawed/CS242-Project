I also help improve public communication about evolution, through co-participatory research and citizen science.  \n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are prevalent in fruit flies and provide an interesting evolutionary conundrum. Males can benefit from transferring STIs as they hinder the female’s ability to re-\nmate, so more offspring have his genes. However, this puts selective pressure on the female to reduce the infection’s impact on her health. This is ‘sexual selection’; sexes within a species competing against each other for individual benefit.    \n\nWe know that fruit flies drink the alcohol produced by yeast on rotting fruit and we want to understand why. We think this might help protect them from the impacts of an STI. So far, I’ve found that females prefer the yeast species Metschnikowia pulcherrima, used in wine production, just as humans might prefer a particular beer or wine. Consuming this yeast helps them produce more offspring and live longer when infected.  \n\nI’m happy to answer any questions regarding my research or PhD life!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://www.flickr.com/photos/uniofbath/52717001227/in/dateposted/)!",

        "text": "Hello and welcome everyone! My name is Sean I have traveled and cooked professionally, for most of my adult life. I am also the founder of Gradito – an online marketplace for trusted and talented private chefs and sommeliers.  \n\nWhen I traveled throughout Italy, I did it via train from Naples to Venice – stopping anywhere I could to eat and enjoy the wine. My primary aim was to understand the flavors and experience as many restaurants as I could. What I didn’t anticipate was the feeling of embrace by the people of Italy as a foreigner. The gracious hosting which I enjoyed while catching up with old friends, making new ones, and experiencing Italy’s welcoming hospitality which is so embedded into the cultural fibers of life.\n\nThere was one word that touched me because it was always associated with warm hospitality – ‘Gradito’! As per ‘welcome’. Referring to a welcome guest (ospite gradito) or a welcome dinner (cena granita) – it resonates with everything we love about Italian wine &amp; food culture but cannot describe in less than a sentence. It’s the word Italians use to say: ‘I give you what is most intimate and precious to me – my home.’ And it makes you feel like any meal served with their special attention tastes like a Michelin star experience.\n\nSo Gradito is – a feeling of welcoming through food, wine, and service – returned to you within your own home. \n\n10 years later, I am here, with my around-the-world experience and I keep coming back to these memories and feel that people today are seeking similar emotions. This is why we've created [Gradito.com](https://Gradito.com) \\- a platform to connect people through the vision of bringing the best chefs to the homes of its clients. To give them an experience and grant the time they lack or to adorn the occasion they celebrate. And in exchange, get closer to new customers, open their horizons, and reach new heights of their talent. Today the platform welcomes a new chef every month. Serves a new client every week. Tomorrow, you might see it as the most memorable, healthy, uplifting, or impressive way to have a meal at your own home.\n\nI invite you to discover Gradito and hire a private chef within minutes, at your home or office.",

I came up with Guidebook - while LinkedIn shows what was done at each job, Guidebook is about how people got there, advice they have, and skills they need for success. We’ve already got a ton of careers, from engineers, doctors, journalists, and more, but also some pretty unique paths from the likes of Tony Hawk, TV hosts, and pro athletes.\n\nIf you care about education for the future and want to share your path on the site, comment below! Literally any path is one worth learning from. It's currently invite-only, but I'm letting people from Reddit on!\n\n(below is copy and pasted from my previous ama)\nAs a teen, I find it harder and harder to know what kinds of careers are out there and which ones I should do, and I feel like a lot of teenagers feel the same way. I wanted to try to do something to help, and started a podcast where I interview different people about their jobs to teach teenagers (and adults) about what it’s like being a particular career. I’ve interviewed amazing people, and love doing it. \n\nSome (more famous) guests have included Grammy-winning band Portugal. the Man, language creator David J. Peterson, CONAN producer Aaron Bleyaert, and Inside the NBA Host Ernie Johnson, but I also talk to people with conventional jobs like tradesmen, accountants, dentists, and more.\n\nHere's me getting [featured](https://i.imgur.com/Xcc3Tjo.png) on Spotify.\n\nIf you want to ask any questions, do so below and I’ll try to get to as many as possible!\n\n**Proof:**\n\nMy last AMA: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b2dhuf/im_the_high_school_podcaster_that_just_got/\n\nMore proof (My anchor dashboard): https://i.imgur.com/KlhEFLF.jpg\n\nMore more proof: https://www.guidebook.gg/ama",
