I hear it all the time when people talk about the singularity (or teleporting), that you would be uploading yourself (or creating a copy of yourself elsewhere) What I don't understand is that making a copy doesn't solve what you do with your \"consciousness\" when you get older. Would you just be making a sort of museum copy of yourself that has your memories and experiences but goes on to live it's own existence? Is anyone working on solving this in a way that actually moves what \"you\" are into some vessel to prolong your existence?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your thoughtful and thought provoking replies.

        "text": "If we're ever able to join some kind of collective consciousness what would that mean for us? Adult brains are already pretty specialized so I doubt that we would become something akin to the neurons in our own minds. Even if we had a very low level type of connection where there would be no way to distinguish where a thought originated from, we would still have our own individual memories, and presumably personalities. If we went a safer route and had some kind of firewall that let in other minds' thoughts in a way more like  messages we wouldn't be anything more than humans with built-in phones. I think to get it to really work our minds would have to be capable of reconfiguring themselves drastically, or we would need some way to do it artificially. I think the latter is possible but it would probably have to be destructive, require replacing/removing the part of our brain that governs the self. What I'm wondering is if  e we do that, yes we won't be individuals anymore but will it even be us? Or will it be something else just using our neurons? How much of what makes us us resides in the part of our mind that would need to go? Would it even be worth it if we're essentially killed in the process? For the good of creating something bigger than ourselves I'd say yes but individually no. To actually find out we'd either need an understanding of our minds orders of magnitudes higher than we have now or we'd need to start chopping out people's minds and seeing what's left, which is obviously highly unethical. \n\nIf any of you have thoughts on the subject I'd like to read them, apologies if I've rambled too much or all of this has been brought up before.",

(Right now prosthesis are basically advanded stumps. Prosthetics need not only to react according to the brain, they should also provide feedback. Giving the person the feeling of touch, temperature etc etc) - This technology also exists, it just needs to be improved ex: bionic eyes\n3- Being adaptable, aka go-go-gadget. (Going for a swim? Attach fins to your legs. Climbing a mountain? Give yourself an extra 20 cm to reach those high ledges. You get the point)\n4(optional)- Individuality. (You can choose what kind of prosthetic you want. Maybe you want to go for the cyborg look? No problem. Go all bling with a golden arm. Or just keep it simple and go with a prosthetic that is indistinguishable from the natural body part)",

Please don't be harsh on me, I thought of this and wanted to know if there is anything like it but couldn't find anything.\n\nAlso, the only way that I'm aware that consciousness uploading is expected to happen somewhat soon is by slicing the person and scanning the state of the nervous system (very reductionist approach to explain it, I know), so if there are other methods, I'm not really aware of them.\n\nThanks for your help in answering to my curious and probably dumb question. :)",

His sentiment turns out to be accurate and the story follows the life of the girl as she experiences the changes that result from the singularity: mind uploading, walking on the surface of (I think) Jupiter, encountering and merging with extra-terrestrial species.\n\nThen the story arcs back as she remembers that conversation she had with the man in the beginning. She then sets off to try to clone him but becomes frustrated as she realizes there isn't enough information (physical/quantum/DNA) in order to do so.\n\nI can't remember if it ends there, but hopefully this is enough information for someone to point me in the right direction.\n\nThanks.",

Due to language and cultural barriers, Ledo lives as a lonely foreigner... but he's not alone. Ledo is just beginning his days on this green planet, asking what he must do to survive here, and what he is living for. \n\nThe synopsis wouldn't lead you to reason it but it's actually a serious anime on a future where Transhumanism has been realized. I won't give away too much. You just have to watch it.

One would optimize human freedoms by unbinding us from our physical embodiments, allowing us to exist in virtual spaces, acquire physiological enhancements, and even extend our life-span. In this path, self-expression, individuality would be exalted since we would actually have autonomy over the medium of our existence, and our physical embodiment.  \n\nAlternately, I see trans-humanists attempting to optimize culture and society, establishing a \"perfect\" society devoid of suffering, inequality, poverty, and violence. I imagine this world resembling the society described in Brave New World. However, despite being a seemingly perfect society, it was at the price of everyone's individuality. Even though the lifestyle is still apparently fulfilling, is this the world trans-humanists ultimately want, or is this vision of the future ultimately degrading to human nature?\n\nWhat are your opinions?",
