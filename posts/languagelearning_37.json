Everyone makes it sound so simple that I'm starting to think something might actually be wrong with me, and my brain isn't cut out for language learning.\n\n It feels like it should be able to learn this, and it should be hard but not this hard. I have a tutor who i see twice a week, I use linq to read stuff, I write little paragraphs with rough grammar to practice. The only thing that's somewhat easy is the pronounciation, but the grammar and vocabulary is so hard to remember. I feel like I have to think so hard before speaking that I just get discouraged because my conversations can't have a normal flow. I mostly read on language forums and videos that people say just listen to music, watch movies and consume comprehensible input and then suddenly they're b1 in a year. Has anyone else felt like this and then still was able to continue and achieve a b1+ level in a new language at some point?

I keep seeing four distinct arguments (among communities outside of language learning, but I would hope this could serve as a fruitful discussion here) that always start with one of two thesis statements. \"English is easy;\" vs. \"English is hard.\"  \n\n\nPeople saying English is easy typically have two very, very opposing reasons for saying that.  \n\n\n**English is easy; foreigners should have no trouble learning it**  \nThis argument is common in monolingual English spaces. \"English is so easy to learn, if everyone learnt it, we wouldn't have communication barriers,\" and other such points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat argument is just the tip of the iceberg. I've experienced just as much the argument from non-native communities of those who learnt English at a fairly young age and can speak it rather eloquently.\n\n**English is easy; Americans shouldn't stroke their ego by saying it's hard.**\n\nI saw this exact argument in an Instagram thread about a foreign speaker complaining about English verbs (it was in fact a comedy sketch, and the joke was that English's 3P sing. ending and the plural noun ending are the exact same). The thing is, this argument isn't usually unprompted. It's typically in response to this:\n\n**English is hard; I shouldn't need to learn a foreign language**\n\nThis argument is more or less along the lines of \"I've already spent my entire life learning one *hard language*, I shouldn't need to have another entire language on my mind.\" It's terribly misguided.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**English is hard; foreign speakers shouldn't be shamed for not getting it perfect**\n\nI agree with this argument the most, since it comes from a place of empathy towards foreigners. English is weird and has unique rules that a lot of languages may not have‚ÄîThat's confirmed. Even native speakers err in their own language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \"English is easy, English is hard\" debate has been going on for centuries, true, and while there's quite a bit of common ground you can find between the two sides, there continue to be stragglers vying for the \"answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed it's kinda like an SAT question.

        "text": "So long story short; I've been trying to learn russian on my own for a while now because my boyfriend is from Kazakhstan, but his family speaks russian in their household. \n\nI can read cyrilic and have practiced writting as well, and I understand a bit of it too, basic but enough to answer if I need anything and have a short conversation. But sadly I haven't been able to practice speaking because I'm terrified... I get really anxious!\n\nEverytime I've tried I've felt really stupid speaking to them. I tried a couple of times but got really insecure. His sister has laughed at me or I've been pressured a lot to speak and I just feel really nervous the whole time. I don't really understand it. English isn't my first language either (it's spanish) and never with english did I feel intimidated speaking it. I also learned japanese for a while and got very far with it, not much of an issue practicing and speaking with friends. So this is something very new for me.\n\nAny tips on what I can do, help me lose my fear or resources I could acces to practice speaking without the feeling that I'm being judged? Much appreciated!",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\nSo I‚Äôm a 2nd gen Taiwanese American (high schooler), and grew up speaking Mandarin and English (Mandarin being a second language of those two). I‚Äôve always thought my Mandarin is pretty on point and a lot of people say that too.  A few years ago, I decided to connect with my culture more/expand my word usage and started listening to MandoPop and watching Taiwanese YouTubers, picking up new vocabulary among the way.  And I‚Äôve made the point of trying to use that vocab in everyday talk with my mom or others I speak Mandarin to. \n\nRecently, I‚Äôve noticed my tones are sometimes off or I pronounce sometimes kind of weirdly (IMO). Or sometimes I get stuck and don‚Äôt know how to say something in Mandarin.  Another part is Im starting to overthink when I say some words like ‰∫å, I make a point to say it the Taiwanese way (between uh and er), or ÈÄôÊ®£ like ÈÜ¨ (I‚Äôm also starting to think words in the English spelling before saying it).  I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs natural for people to get worse in their second language as they get older (at least for 10-20) or is it purely me overthinking to the point where I‚Äôm screwing up how I say it.",

A lot of people say the best way to learn a new language is to find someone who speaks the language you want to learn and learn it one on one with them. So, I thought about finding some online services where you can connect with native speakers to learn the language. \n\nI‚Äôve heard the app Italki is a great resource for this, and the teachers only charge up to $10 and hour for a lesson which sounds great. The problem is that I‚Äôm wondering if this is too good to be true, and I‚Äôve also heard that it can be difficult to find a tutor on Italki.",

        "text": "Hello fellow language enthusiasts!\n\nI wanted to share my experience learning English as a second language. I grew up speaking a different language at home and in my community, so learning English was challenging for me. However, I was determined to succeed and ended up falling in love with the language.\n\nOne of my biggest challenges was learning how to pronounce words properly. English has a lot of weird spelling rules, and it can be difficult to know how to say a word just by looking at it. I found that the best way to improve my pronunciation was to listen to native speakers and mimic their sounds as closely as possible. It was also helpful to practice reading out loud, as this helped me to get a feel for the rhythm and flow of the language.\n\nAnother challenge I faced was learning all of the grammar rules. English has many of them, which can be overwhelming at first. However, I found that the more I read and listened to the language, the more natural it started to feel. I also found that breaking the grammar rules down into smaller chunks and practicing them one at a time helped me to better understand and remember them.\n\nOverall, learning English has been a rewarding experience for me. It has opened up so many doors and allowed me to communicate with a broader range of people. Don't get discouraged if you are learning English as a second language. It takes time and practice, but the rewards are worth it.\n\nHappy language learning!",

        "text": "I was learning French for 6 years of my school career and for around a year just out of self interest and pursuing a dream of becoming fluent. Since then, life just took control and I haven‚Äôt actively practiced for over a year. How does one recommend getting back into it? I used to be so into it, I‚Äôd watch shows in French, do my lessons multiple times a day, read French comic books but now I‚Äôm not even sure what level I‚Äôm at anymore so the start line is very blurred \n\nAlso, I‚Äôve heard people raving about this chrome extension where you can add foreign subtitles alongside the English subtitles and they say it‚Äôs an amazing way to learn. Is this really that good? Sounds like it would be a very cluttered mess. I‚Äôd be overstimulated trying to ready two subtitles and listen to the show lol",
