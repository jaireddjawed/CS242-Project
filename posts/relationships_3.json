        "text": "Tl;Dr gf is in a bad financial place with jobs, I’m in a good spot, and I don’t know how to give her advice because she has a hard time doing difficult things\n\n\nMet a year ago. We don’t live together. We don’t have shared finances. I’m currently 3 hours away doing an internship where I’m making $30/hr and don’t have rent. She works at a preschool making $14.50. I’m in a comfortable financial situation in terms of habits, awareness, and savings. She has next to no savings, lives paycheck to paycheck, and is constantly in a stressful financial situation anytime an unexpected expense comes up or she has to miss work. \n\nHer current pickle is that her family has a trip to her dads home country, and her work said they can’t give her the 11 days off, even though she requested it 3 months in advance. When she was told she can’t have the time off, she said “okay, I won’t go then. I can’t really afford to miss that much work anyways.”  (Also side note: it seems like she was denied having these dates off because “too many people had requested it off” but then found out later someone else was given the same time off after he request was denied). Her mom said that she has to go, the plane tickets are already bought; that if my gf doesn’t go, she owes her mom $1000 for the ticket (which is a bit silly because her parents are wealthy; $1k is pocket change to them, but it’s more than my gf’s rent) So my gf was trying to figure out what to do for weeks, and kept putting off talking to her boss about how she’s in a tough spot and needs to take the time off (she said she would send an email explaining that if she can’t get the time off she would have to quit to avoid owing her mom $1000; she procrastinated sending the email for weeks and it’s still not sent) \n\nLong story short, her mom finally said that my gf can go or not go, it doesn’t matter, and she won’t owe any money for the ticket. \n\nSo that weight is off her shoulders a bit, but all of this made her realize how shitty her job is (she loves the work, loves the kids, but the pay isn’t good, and the fact that she has such a struggle with her boss regarding time off (another side note: my gf gets sick semi regularly due to being around kids, and last time she could hardly breathe and didn’t want to get the kids sick and she called in to work, the boss asked her what her symptoms were and trying to convince her to come in because they didn’t have enough people), so even though she’s off the hook with this trip as far as the ticket goes, she still feels she needs to find a different job; and she still can’t afford to take nearly 2 weeks off from work, not to mention she’ll probably have to pay for stuff on the trip itself like food and whatnot. \n\nIt’s worth mentioning that my gf has an incredibly hard time doing difficult things. I don’t know anything about adhd, but she says that’s the cause. She stopped going to school after about a year and says she’s “bad at school” and doesn’t want to go back. She refuses to do any budgeting (she says “my system works for me”; yet for example she had a $17 subscription she’s been paying for since 2021 that she just saw, so clearly she’s not very aware of her finances). She’s had, in the year I’ve known her, probably 5 different “oh shit, i can afford gas or groceries or bills, but not all three” moments. One time her parents had to help her pay for stuff. Yet each time these moments occur, she doesn’t make any major changes to avoid it happening the next time. She’s talked about getting a new job when these things happen, but then doesn’t continue. She says she can’t handle a desk job, but knows that the type of job she has now (interacting with kids) doesn’t pay enough. In essence, she’s constantly in a tight spot financially but each time she gets out of it, continues on in more or less the same way. \n\nSo we plan on talking about this trip dilemma later today on the phone because she’s really not sure what to do. I really don’t know what to tell her. My advice each time she’s in a tough spot is essentially to suck it up, research good paying jobs she could go to school for, humble herself and ask her parents to help support her in this journey by paying for school or letting her move back in or something (I think this could work because her dad has quite literally told her that she needs to try harder; it’s clear he wants effort out of her above all else; he has savings for both of his children, im sure he would be okay with her using that for improving her situation by getting an education). I say this a bit more diplomatically to her but this is putting it all bluntly. I see school as the best long term avenue (although it doesn’t solve her immediate crisis, but that fact that she has crises all the time means something needs to be done), but I’m also biased towards school because that’s what has led me to the place where I’m at, which is quite comfortable. I also encourage her to start budgeting, to become aware of her finances. But she refuses. \n\nI’m not sure what I can say to her when we discuss this later. All the options suck for various reasons because every time she had reason in the past to make a change, she refused to.",

        "text": "\nSo there’s this girl at work (21F) which I (25M) clicked with right away when we first met. We’re talking here and there but nothing special going on. Few months go by, I suddenly develop strong feelings for this girl. It was quite sudden and intense. At one point it got so intense I decided to tell her about it - she turned me down. \n\nNo big deal, then we keep talking like normal, but now we gradually start talking even more and get closer in the process. We’re both rather fun in nature, we just have fun in the boring workplace. However, I am no longer going in with any romantic intent/expectation. She’s just a cool person at work that I like to talk to and with whom we have many things to talk about and whom I have interest to get to know better (as a person). \n\nThen few months later, suddenly out of nowhere she began showing a strong interest in me for about 2 weeks, perhaps 3. I was riding the wave and enjoying the ride, but I also started developing those strong and intense feelings from before, again. I fell quick and I fell hard. But after those 2-3 weeks, she started to, not slowly but rather quickly, by the day, show less and less interest and attraction, and now we don’t really talk anymore at all. But those 2 weeks felt so so real, it felt like teenagers being in love in high school. It felt so real \n\nWhole thing threw me quite off guard really, but the thing that annoys me the most is I have no idea why that last bit happened. And how should I best proceed from the current situation? I am aware that this person(or soul) has some really really special role in my life, I just can’t quite figure it out, and this I am confused about my next move(s) and general direction even. I would much appreciate some guidance/advice.\n\n\nTL;DR - Fell for a girl at work. Told her about it, she turned me down. No big deal. We kept talking, I no longer had romantic expectations or intentions. We start talking more and we get closer, then she suddenly began showing strong interest for 2-3 weeks then suddenly began acting completely indifferent - now we don’t really talk anymore. Idk how to interpret the whole thing, *especially* that last bit.",

We live together, have a strong bond, and I love him very much and have no interest in anybody else. \n\nThis morning, I woke up to a snapchat from an old flame I 'dated' (rather, it was more like a situationship, no title, but it was the most traumatic romantic and sexual connection I've ever experienced.) We are not even friends on the app and never were so I don't know how he found me. I debated whether to even open it but curiosity got the best of me, as he hasn't reached out a single time in the 3 years we've been broken up, despite sliding me requests on social media that I've declined. I wondered what he could possibly be saying.\n\nThe snap turned out to be a video of him shirtless, flexing and making what I guess were supposed to be seductive faces. There was no caption, not even a greeting. I felt violated, did not respond, and immediately blocked him.\n\nThe problem is I feel guilty for having even opened it despite doing nothing else wrong. In addition to that, I've been feeling on edge  because, even though this was not nearly as extreme, that kind of agressive sexual behavior is exactly what traumatized me in our past connection. I'm torn about whether to tell my boyfriend or not, because on one hand, the snap made me uncomfortable and he is my committed partner and confidant, but on the other hand, I didn't entertain my ex at all and don't want to put any unnecessary worries in my boyfriend's head. \n\nTLDR: Ex-flame sent me a semi-nude video unsolicited, I didn't entertain it and blocked him. Should I still tell my current boyfriend or not?",

        "text": "I’m (18f) somewhat dating this one guy (19m, I’ll call him T for this purpose). we never officially put a name on what we are but it’s definitely more than a situationship, cause we tell each other we love each other daily, and overall act like a couple despite not having a label). Anyways, T’s ex (20m) and him are still good friends and they keep in touch through stuff like discord and Snapchat because they live in different states. T broke it off about a year ago (might’ve been longer idk the exact timeframe they’ve dated), and T and I started becoming “more than friends” around September/October having met in July. Anyways, the two of them sometimes still voice call and overall hang out on discord, except when he brings it up like “I called with (ex’s name) this entire morning” when I ask what he did, I can’t help but feel self conscious. I feel guilty for feeling this way since we aren’t even official a couple. What really bugs me though is T does stuff with his ex he doesn’t want to do with me, like watch movies over a discord call. When I propose we maybe watch something, he is always reluctant. Granted, we live close to one another and see each other a few times a week. \n\nAm I wrong to feel jealous, and how can I stop feeling this way? Also, I am quite certain there are no more romantic feelings between the two of them, they just have a good friendship bc T helped his ex through a buncha trauma like he’s helping me rn. \n\nI don’t know how to bring up my concerns to him because I don’t want to seem controlling, but I guess it really affects me mentally sometimes (especially that he does stuff with his ex he doesn’t do with me). Like I said though, we watch movies in person together and hang out in person often and I know his ex realistically doesn’t even pose any risk to our relationship cause T is the one who broke things off. \n\nTLDR: feel self conscious and jealous of my kinda bf’s ex even though they’re just good friends",

        "text": "I, female (26) and my boyfriend male (23) were in a serious, committed, and exclusive relationship for over 1 year. \n\nWe started talking in 2019 when he was (20) and I was (22). And at the time he wasn't interested in marriage so we didn't continue to talk. However in 2022, we reconnected and this time he said he was serious and ready for marriage and stated that he wanted to get to know me for the purpose of marriage. \n\nWe are both Muslim, Pakistani, and raised in the GTA. \n\nOn March 14, 2023 I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. \n\nThe way I found out sounds almost unbelievable. \n\nHe came from the University of Toronto (Mississauga campus) to pick me up from my place after I finished work and we went to the McDonald's near my house. \n\nWe were at McDonald's sitting at one of the booths drinking our iced coffees. A little boy named David started playing peek-a-boo with me behind my boyfriend's side of the booth. \n\nAfter a while of playing my boyfriend seemed visibly annoyed with the little boy. I found the little boy very cute so I asked if he wanted to sit with us for a bit. He sat next to us and was such a sweet kid. He later returned back to his table behind my boyfriend's side of the booth. He peeked over again to play peekaboo. However, this time David looked shocked. He said miss, miss, he's looking at pictures of other girls. \n\nAnd I laughed and said what? And he said yah he's looking at pictures of other girls that aren't you! I turned to my boyfriend. David came back and sat next to us. And I asked him can I see your phone? And he said the kid is lying. I said okay lol. And then David replied miss I'm not lying, he is! I said, honestly you know that children don't lie. Can I see your phone? And so after a long hesitation he handed me his phone. On his snapchat I saw a few women snapping him constantly. Maybe 100s of snaps in the last 24 hours. So I opened one and it's pictures of a naked girl. I kept opening them and it was more and more explicit pictures of the same girl. \n\nI opened other snaps he was sent and it was the same thing but different girls. When I showed him his phone and said dude wtf? Who are these girls. He replied and laughed and said no dw it's just porn, probably a bot account. I replied saying that you added on Snapchat? And he said yah they requested me and I followed them back. I said but you're saving all the videos she sends you? And he said yah so I can watch them later y'know. I asked him, do you think that I would think that's okay?? He was silent. \n\nI had a random gut feeling and asked him to show me his Instagram account. And he said no. I said why. He said I deleted it. I said redownload it. Redownload it rn. I took his phone and downloaded it and made him sign in. After a lot of hesitation he signed in. \n\nI don't have Instagram. I've never made one. I'm not sure how to navigate the app. I asked him where are the DMs? And he pointed at the arrow, I opened them. I was shocked. He wasn't just talking to 1 or 2 girls. So many girls in the GTA. He was messaging them first. He was asking them to hangout. He was meeting them at their house. He legit met one girl the same day he saw me and rushed me that he needed to go? He met with girls while I was here in the GTA and when I attended a destination wedding in Thailand. He was talking to these girls while we were in a serious, committed, exclusive relationship. \n\nI asked him why? What did you do with these other girls? And when he said nothing. I asked him. Did you meet up with them? He said yes. I asked him again. What did you do with them? And he replied nothing. He even tried to gaslight me that it's not that big of a deal because it happened a couple of months ago? \n\nI wasn't having any of that and that's when I realized he's not going to tell me the truth. \n\nSo I took his phone and walked outside of McDonald's and proceeded to walk home which was about a 25 minute walk in -3 degrees Celsius without a jacket. He followed me. He kept saying can we please talk! And I kept calling him an a******. He ran back to his car. And then continued to follow me in his car shouting my name and asking can we please talk? \n\nI called my brother. I told him it's an emergency and to come pick me up from the street I was walking on. He came within a few mins of me calling him. My boyfriend saw my brother pull up and so he sped off and ended up going to his evening class at the University of Toronto (commuted from the Mississauga campus to the Toronto campus). \n\nI proceeded to call his older brother (he's an Imaam or like an Islamic priest) on my boyfriend's phone and tell him everything that happened. I was really distressed so I was basically just screaming that he's cheating on me and we're supposed to introduce parents soon and continue marriage talks in May??? His brother apologized on his behalf. I ended up hanging up. \n\nI had plans with my friends to go to the movies after work. So outside my house my friend was waiting in the car. I left my brother's car and went into her car. We drove to the movie theaters (Winston Churchill Cineplex) to meet up with my other friend. And we were returned our movie tickets. \n\nWe ended up going back and forth between Oakville and Mississauga. \n\nAnd I decided I'm going to go to his house and tell his parents what he did. He lives in Ancaster which is so far out but my friends were willing to drive me. \n\nI have never met his parents. He is scared of his parents. And I knew that. He has never told his parents about me. He had only recently told his brother that he wanted to marry me and needed his help to tell their parents. \n\nSo I drove with my friends to his house and ended up conversing with his family about what he did. They asked me so many questions about myself and what I was doing here and what I want in terms of next steps. They wanted to confirm with me that I no longer want to be in a relationship with him. They advised me that I shouldn't be with someone that behaves this way. We left from their home and drove back to Mississauga and I was dropped off at my place. \n\nWhen I got home I realized because I had his phone. He was emailing me the entire time asking to meet up to talk. \n\nHowever, in person earlier when I asked him why he did it, his only response was I thought we were going to break up in December so I didn't think it mattered anymore? When I asked them why the f*** would you think we were going to break up in December? We were so good? Like he was buying me flowers. We were going on dates? We were seeing each other frequently and talking all day. \n\nAnd it's because in December he came clean to me about lying from the start of our relationship. He lied that he was going to graduate in December, 2022. The reason that lie is significant is because when we were getting into a relationship i didn't want to date someone who wasn't done university and wasn't currently working. FYI - I have three university degrees: two undergraduate degrees and my Masters and I work full-time. However he told me he had a plan, and he was on track to graduate by December and he should have a job by then as well. \n\nHowever, he was failing all his courses. And in 2022, only passed 1 course out of all the courses he took. So he was well aware he wasn't graduating. Yet he continued talking about proceeding towards marriage. We even went engagement ring shopping. And so he thought when he came clean and told me the truth about lying about his grades and graduation I would just break up with him. Because it would take a long time for him to graduate and he still wouldn't have a job in our initial agreed upon timeline. \n\nHowever, I forgave him because I saw how genuinely and deeply sorry he was for lying to me about his grades and graduation. I guess he didn't anticipate for me to forgive him? That still doesn't give him the right to engage in romantic conversations and sexual activity with other women because he is planning to break up with me anyways in December. So it's okay to cheat from Sept - Nov. Like I'm not in the know. I am not aware. I had no clue. So I don't think it's justified but that's how he justified it to himself. \n\nFor me - cheating is unforgivable. \nTo him - telling his parents or even going to his house was unforgivable. \n\nHe crossed my boundaries and so I crossed his. \nBecause clearly he lacks the capacity to empathize with me. At this point with all the lying and the cheating, what more does he want me to endure? Like you pushed back all our timelines? Our future is very uncertain right now. It's all dependent on whether or not you get your s*** together. And genuinely I've been helping him through everything. With assignments, work applications, being a source of encouragement, and literally being his best friend. \n\nHe also had so many opportunities to come clean to me in December. I even told him if you've been lying about anything else or if you've been cheating on me cuz usually lying and cheating go hand in hand. Please tell me now and I'm willing to forgive everything and we can move forward. \n\nAnd he said no. I promise that's the only thing that I lied about. And I said okay we can continue our relationship. \n\nI wanted input on the following: \nI don't know if what I did was okay. \n\nMy friends are telling me that: \n1. He had clear intentions of cheating on me. \n2. He planned it by messaging other girls and meeting up with them. \n3. His motive was sexual in nature.\n\nAnd all of that is unforgivable and it's not a mistake that just happened once. \n\nMy brother still has his phone. His parents are coming to pick up his phone today from my house. Because they want evidence of what type of sexual activities he was engaging in.  \n\nI don't know what's going to happen to him because I know he comes from a very strict religious family. \n\nI noticed both his cell phone lines (US and CAN) were cut off. \n\nI'm going through mental turmoil. \n\nI literally hate him and I can't forgive him. At the same time I never got any closure or any real understanding why this happened. \n\nI can't sleep, I haven't eaten anything since Monday night, I'm not able to focus at work, and my mind is scattered, and I feel betrayed and heart broken. \n\nI'm lost.\n\n\nTLDR: summary here\n\nMy boyfriend and I dated for over one year. He comes from a strict Muslim family. He cheated on me a couple days ago. I took his phone. I ended up going to his house and telling his family. I still have his phone. His parents are going to come pick up his phone soon. I don't know what's going to happen to him and I don't know if what I did is wrong. I got absolutely no closure.",

He threatens me and says this won't work out and he will leave me if I don't get a job. Makes me feel bad to the point I start crying and get called dumb for crying. After my two interviews he asked me what I told them in interviews and said I'm not saying the \"right words\" to get the job. Idk what to do anymore at this point. I'm depressed and told him this and he basically says \"get over it you have to work quit acting like a child.\"\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend putting me down about getting a job when I'm trying my best.",

        "text": "You say we’re just friends\n\nWe started when you were already with someone. But we were just kids. And we were friends. Really, truly, just friends. I never thought I’d ever think of you like that. We just talked on the phone one night. And we just clicked. I found myself telling you about random things and we just kept talking. But we were definitely just friends. I liked someone else and you were dating someone else so we were really just friends. Then we got closer. We started talking a lot more and your girlfriend (who I used to be friends with and who I even encouraged to date you) suddenly had a problem with me. And I thought she was crazy? I would never like you like that. You weren’t my type at all and I liked someone else a lot. But then idk what happened. Really slowly and really gradually you just crept into my life. You were suddenly a part of my everyday. We just *clicked*. There’s no other way to describe it. We became so close, closer than any other friend I had. We had secret conversations and we thought no one else would ever understand us. We were unique. We were *different*. We were us. We were just kids but you were the first person I said “i love you” to (even though you said it first and all I replied was a polite thankyou). We became so close that you were the only person I liked taking to. I told you everything and you told me things you’d never told anyone before. You eventually broke up with your girlfriend (I thought I had nothing to do with that but she still blames me for it). When high school ended and my plans for my dream college shattered (couldn’t afford it and had to go to a cheaper school closer to home), you were there for me. You stayed here when all my friends moved far away. You were my constant support system. We met almost everyday. We were still friends but we started crossing some lines. Friends don’t usually say “I love you” every night. Friends don’t usually sleep on FaceTime or on the phone. Friends don’t usually hold hands and linger too long for hugs. Then my life hit rock bottom and you were the only one there for me. Friends don’t usually have phone sex. But at that point, we’d crossed enough lines that this felt natural. It felt comforting. We always said we’re friends. But we were “best friends”. We made promises of forever. We said we’d always love each other more than anyone else. You were mine. I was yours. \n\nI stayed in that rock bottom phase of my life and you were my life boat. But you had to move to the opposite side of the country. We still made promises of how it’d work. Long distance friendships work. It worked for 8 months. Phone sex and sleeping on the phone lasted 8 months. Then you found someone. You started dating her. My heart shattered into a million pieces and I can’t explain why. Or maybe I can. I just don’t want to. It breaks my heart that you’re dating someone. I know we were just friends but You were mine. Only mine. Idk what to do now. \n\n\nYou say we’re “friends”. But this was more than friendship. I just don’t know what to say now. Or how to say it. So I’ll cry myself to sleep.\n\nTldr: Friendship situationship is now breaking my heart once the guy is moving on",

So this relationship has been completely the opposite. We haven’t had any big fights and there’s plenty of communication, honesty, etc. \n\nThere’s one small problem and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. At first it was fine and I’d joke back. However, it’s beginning to bother me. My boyfriend has a habit of constantly responding to me by saying “rude” or “that’s not nice” or “quit being mean to me”. Even when I’m not being mean. So I started getting upset and he apologizes and truly feels bad. But what really crossed the line for me, is when we were with my dad and he tells my dad to tell me to “stop being mean to him and calling him names”. Which I didn’t. I called him out on it yesterday and he said that he was sorry and it was his attempt at flirting. He hasn’t had any healthy relationships before me, so I don’t know whether to believe that it’s truly his attempt at flirting or what. Am I overreacting?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! \n\nTL;DR BF jokes about me “being mean”",

I thought it would be a good chance for my bf to meet my friends so I mentioned it to him and he was excited. He can be quite socially anxious and shy/quiet in groups and especially meeting new people. \n\nWhen we get to my friends, there's me, my bf and 2 of my friends. My friend and I start catching up and she's talking about mutual friends and I try explaining to my bf who the people are that are being mentioned so he can keep up with the conversation and feel involved. My other friend spoke to my bf for a bit, asking him questions and being friendly and it looked like he was more comfortable. The friend I was catching up with didn't seem to talk to my bf a lot and mainly spoke to me then we went out to the bar and club and after about an hour my bf wanted to leave. I could see he was annoyed or upset so we left. \n\nThe next morning I asked him what was wrong and he said he felt like an outsider all night and that every time he attempted to make conversation with my friend, she's either give him a one word answer or change the topic of conversation to yet another person he didn't know. He said she was rude and it felt like he'd been invited just to be ignored. I'm not really sure what to do but I can see that it's annoyed or upset my bf.

        "text": " \n\nThrowaway account, as he knows my other account.\n\nBeen together for almost 5 years. Moved in together 6 months ago. 1 year ago my health rapidly declined, through testing and procedures, we finally know what's going on and I have a consultation with my surgeon this month. Recovery will be 2 months. So I had to stop working as I had a chronic illness out of control. He started a new job 6 months ago, which require us to move. He knew because of my condition I wouldn't be able to contribute financially for a while. I was uncomfortable with this because I've always taken care of myself, but he insisted. One is because he wanted to prove to himself and me that he could take care of a household and also because the place I was at was aggravating my illness. Talked about potentially moving in together for a whole year, so here we are.\n\nI knew my BF didn't know how to cook and clean because his place was always really dirty, like filthy to the point I wouldn't go over his house. I told him when we moved in together he would have to learn how to clean up after himself, as I keep a clean place. Moved in together and the truth came out, he didn't know how to properly clean, (even basic cleaning), as his mother hired a maid for him and his able bodied brothers. He was VERY embarrassed but was open to learning. Showed him the ropes and now he gets up on Sat and deep cleans with me. As I keep it clean throughout the week since I'm home.\n\nHere's where my question come in. I hear a lot about if one partner is working and the other is home. The one at home should cook and clean. I cook 99% of the meals (he's attempted to cook 2 times, my bday, and valentines day over the course of 6 months), and I clean 96% of the time since we moved in. He doesn't know the first thing about cooking. He comes home, food is cooked, house is spotless. My concern is once we get married or have kids, he won't know a basic life skill. Cooking. I want to teach him, as after recovery I will go back to work that can require me to be gone for weeks, and sometimes months. Even if the project is local, I can get home at 3am.\n\nIs it wrong on the weekends to require him to start cooking meals with me to learn, since he's the one working throughout the week? He will do it if I ask with no problem. But am I being unreasonable for asking? I grew up with a dad who worked and a stay at home mom. But my parents split chores and cooking. So I look at it as a normal request.\n\nTL;DR!\n\nGot ill, had to come off work. Bf and I moved in together for the first time together 6 months ago in a different city and he understood I couldn't not financially contribute until after surgery. He works on weekdays, get's home at 4:30. I cook 99% of the meals and clean 96% of the time. Taught him how to clean (he didn't know how), he helps deep clean on the weekends now. I want him to learn how to cook with me on weekends. So when we get married and have kids he will know how. But don't know if it's reasonable as I'm currently not working for health related reasons.",

        "text": "My ex (20M) broke up with me (21F) a month ago. We dated for 8 months. He broke up with me because he wants to be single and not have to consider another person. He admitted how scared he is to fully let go and love another person-- the lack of control over himself and his emotions, the inevitability of being hurt because he thinks that at this age we're doomed to break up at one point so why not control when he gets hurt and just break up now. I think that he feels a lack of control because before me girls would be obsessed with him, and not that I'm not obsessed, but he shows his love more than I do and I think he has the impression that he loves me more than I love him. A week before the break up he got really scared and upset because he thought I was gonna break up with him (but we wound up having a really good, emotional conversation where he told me how deeply he cares about me. and he later started feeling really uncomfortable from his public display of vulnerability). From all of our conversations, I really think he can see me/wants a future with me but he doesn't want to stop experiencing life while he's young because he's in a relationship. Despite this, I think he truly does love me but with his lack of emotional intelligence and his ingrained selfishness he would rather have the freedoms offered to him by being single (which I'm sure also includes hooking up with girls) than be tied down. (tbh I think that a lot of boys can cheat on their girlfriends and hook up with girls while they still love someone. the selfish one's at least). He's not a bad person, but he has a lot of growing up to do and because of this I do NOT wanna get back together right now. I think he has to change in a way that only happens with time. I'm honestly happy being single and being able to do what I want without the responsibilities of a relationship, I think this is an important period of my life where I might be missing out on fun experiences and doing what I want that I'm not gonna get the chance to do when I'm older.\n\nThe issue is that despite his flaws, he was really my best friend. I love him and I know he loves me, but I don't think this is the worst situation because I've also had a lot of fears about missing out on my youth because the choices I make affect another person. I want to travel, kiss who I want to, and have wild, spontaneous moments that turn into stories-- not have to sacrifice my youth because of a serious almost codependent relationship.\n\nI know that he would be okay with this but I need advice outside from people telling me I deserve better and what he did was fucked up (which I do deserve better, but he never cheated or lied and he's allowed to not want to be in a relationship, even if it hurts me.) I don't want him to never be in my life again, I definitely need more time to solidify the breakup, but I would like to see him occasionally, maybe once or twice a month or less than that or more, in a way that is far from friends, but I still get to have him in my life when I decide. I would only do this once I'm really comfortable being single and I am talking to/hookingup/hanging out around other guys. I know this will change and I will probably meet someone else and be happy, but I don't see myself in a relationship with someone else. I have a few other ex's that I deeply loved and did for a long time, but I have never felt this way about someone else, certain that this is the kind of man I want to marry and be with in the future. So, Should I see my ex occasionally or move on and go no contact?\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend broke up with me a month ago because he can't handle being in a serious relationship; he wants freedom without the responsibility of a relationship and he is afraid of being emotional and being hurt. Being single is probably what I need at this point in my life, but we love each other and I would like to keep him in my life. Should I see him occasionally when I decide or take a clean break?",

Our conversations were usually pretty casual and flirty but romance was never the main topic in the first place since we both were focused on learning a language and I didn't want to do something inconsiderate.\n\nOne day we talked about her favourite romance shows and talked about relationships etc. and she mentioned that she might end up in a second LDR but isn't sure about their standpoints since they have never met and she doesn't want to be with someone she has never met before nor who can't meet her.\n\nI jokingly said that \"I guess I'm unfortunate because I have no chance now\". She was confused and asked if I was flirting. I indirectly answered yes but at the end I said that I like her and would like to get to know her more personally but since she is already \"dating?\" the unkown mentioned person above I told her that I'm fine and respect that, if she doesn't want to date me now. At first she thought that I was sarcastic but then she realized that I was more serious but didn't really reject / turn down on me?\n\nWe were more discussing about why or what I like about her, about her past relationships. She has probably very low self-esteem since she said to me that why someone would like her because she has no special traits and that we haven't talked about very deep topics yet and so on.  \n( Note about LDRs: I don't have any problems with this kind of relationship since I work 100% remote and can very much afford to travel multiple times per year or even move to another country ).\n\nI'm also not sure, if she is just shy, not interest, doesn't know how to answer, busy ( time zone) or it's just the language barrier sometimes since she gives me short replies occasionally ( She actually speaks my language at a good level). She has read yesterdays message but hasn't replied yet.. I might want to give her some space maybe since I don't want to look like clingy or needy\n\nI'm not sure how to move on or what to do know and would like to get advice how I should deal with this situation.\n\nTLDR: I confessed that I like her but she didn't turn me down. She looked in my eyes a little bit confused, unsure and has low self-esteem. Unsure what to do know or how to deal with this situation.",

        "text": "Hey, I don't really know why I have the need to do this but my brain is playing with me so here it is. I am in a quite short relationship at the moment, both me and my new girlfriend are quite into each other and we have been together for 2 weeks now. We talked about our pasts and our experiences that we do not want to happen in our relationship. Everything is just going really good and I like her quite a lot. I did learn quite a lot about her that I like and she learned quite a lot about me that she likes. I have had really bad relationships in the past and those have played a big role for me to not hop into a new relationship pretty fast so I was single for almost 3 years now. Yesterday I had a really bad day for some reason and today when we saw each other I decided to go a bit deep into my traumas. One of those is trust issues, and I wanted to let her know that I do have problem with that but for the duration of our relationship I never had any of those thoughts, I do have a lot of trust in her and I don't really know why I had the need to do that but I did it. Her reaction was at first worrying but I reassured her that with her I don't really feel the same way and it is all good. I really don't know why I said it but there we go it is too late now to go back and change it. I did it because I trust her and I feel safe with her. At the same time I am working on fixing everything with my mental health and I go to therapy as well. Second thing, I hate it when I need to wait for a response for 4-5 hours on the texts, I understand it when I know that for example she studies and I know that she studies, or has uni or work or anything, that is really not the problem. I started laughing when I was telling that because I sounded controlling and she started laughing with me and told me I know what you mean don't worry. I felt dumb and annoyed with myself for telling that the way I told her but here we go. She reassured me she understands it and I have nothing to worry about. I hate it when I don't get the answer when I know she doesn't have anything and basically sits home and plays with her dog for example. Then I asked her would you be okay if I answered you 4 hours later and you know I had nothing beside me sitting by the PC playing games and she said of course I wouldn't be okay. \nI felt good when I told her all of this but at the same time overthinking kicks me in the butt now.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: So basically I told my GF that I have trust issues, but none with her and that with her I feel safe around and I trust her so that's why I told her that. I hate late answers (4-5 hours late answers not 3 hours or less) when I know that both of us are free. She reassured me that everything is fine and that she is happy that I shared all of that with her and made some jokes later during texts about all that. Am I overthinking for no reason?",

        "text": "So there’s this girl at work (21F) which I (25M) clicked with right away when we first met. We’re talking here and there but nothing special going on. Few months go by, I suddenly develop strong feelings for this girl. It was quite sudden and intense. At one point it got so intense I decided to tell her about it - she turned me down. \n\nNo big deal, then we keep talking like normal, but now we gradually start talking even more and get closer in the process. We’re both rather fun in nature, we just have fun in the boring workplace. However, I am no longer going in with any romantic intent/expectation. She’s just a cool person at work that I like to talk to and with whom we have many things to talk about and whom I have interest to get to know better (as a person). \n\nThen few months later, suddenly out of nowhere she began showing a strong interest in me for about 2 weeks, perhaps 3. I was riding the wave and enjoying the ride, but I also started developing those strong and intense feelings from before, again. I fell quick and I fell hard. But after those 2-3 weeks, she started to, not slowly but rather quickly, by the day, show less and less interest and attraction, and now we don’t really talk anymore at all. But those 2 weeks felt so so real, it felt like teenagers being in love in high school. It felt so real \n\nWhole thing threw me quite off guard really, but the thing that annoys me the most is I have no idea why that last bit happened. And how should I best proceed from the current situation? I am aware that this person has some really really special role in my life, I just can’t quite figure it out, and this I am confused about my next move(s) and general direction even. I would much appreciate some guidance/advice.\n\n\nTL;DR - Fell for a girl at work. Told her about it, she turned me down. No big deal. We kept talking, I no longer had romantic expectations or intentions. We start talking more and we get closer, then she suddenly began showing strong interest for 2-3 weeks then suddenly began acting completely indifferent - now we don’t really talk anymore. Idk how to interpret the whole thing, *especially* that last bit.",

We have been living together for almost 3 years now. \n\nI started discussing with him plans for marriage and buying a house as now we are both financially well enough to do so. His response has been to shut off and distance himself from the conversation. . Like puts his headohones on and walk out of the room. I have brought this conversation up multiple times and it has been the same response almost every time. \n\n  Only thing I managed to get from him as a reason is that he does not want to be in debt for the rest of his life to a bank. To him, there is nothing wrong in renting a house till end of time. For me, if we can afford paying the rental money every month, we can afford paying a mortgage. Especially with a very good joint income that we have together. \nI feel like am running out of time. I want to get married for a year or two, buy a house, live for a couple of years till we can further afford getting kids, and then go for that, but by this state, it seems that by then, it would be already too late. He is very much aware of my stance on this. \n\nI just need some advice on what to do and what could he be thinking? I really dont know if there is a compromise in such a situation that would make us happy\n \nThank you\n\n\nTLDR: BF of 6 years does not want to settle down and buy a house together but I want to and acoids the convo when it gets brought up.",

They ate all the food, crashed in our tent and  basically had their own party without hardly acknowledging my presence. I left alone and later on, he accused me of being self centered.\n\n\nI talked to him and he denied all wrong doing. He only focused on his needs during the conversation. How I made him look stupid in front of everyone and how I left him  stranded and so on. He never apologized, didn't even mention it was my own special celebration. I mentioned my needs aren't being met in this relationship and he said I'm being too finicky. That I'm asking to \"see blood\" only because he made the mistake of thinking he had equal footing in  the relationship and bringing people that are important to him to the campout site. The more I tried to reason with him, that it's not about his friends, but rather sneaking them upon me and the occasion, the more he resisted so I gave up. I said I no longer want the relationship because I feel humiliated and that I don't have an actual representation of my needs. \n\n\nHe blew up on me. He said I was testing his patience. That I'm just \"like the others\". That I was never in it to help him or actually invest in what he wanted to build but that I'm full of ego and unwilling to listen. I told him to grab his things and leave but he refused.\n\n\nHe called me about three times after our argument. He was angry and said some awful things, like I need to straighten up my behavior because no man will ever stick around like he did. That basically, he's doing me a favor by being in a long term relationship and that he was gonna propose but I just made him change his mind. I blocked him everywhere, grabbed all his personal stuff and canceled the Airbnb we were staying at. I left all his shit at his best friend's. I'm refusing to take calls from unknown numbers because it might be him. My head is a mess right now. I'm staying at a hotel and thinking about getting a new temp place out of the area. I don't trust him, especially after what I saw in his face during our argument. \n\n\nI feel as hurt as when I broke up with a very snobby ex who poverty shamed me but now this is a twisted reverse situation. Right now, the only person who knows this is my ex boyfriend who's been very supportive and treats me like family. At least I know he doesn't want anything from me. I don't wanna burden him with my stuff because I don't want to abuse his good will. \n\n\nRegarding my new break up, I just wanna get away from him. Another thing, while arguing, his sister's engagement came up. I'm getting the vague impression that he promised his family a wedding at a high end Airbnb that I guess would \"happen\" during one of my stays. I could be wrong but his insistence about not breaking up and continuously saying \" sister just got engaged\" was weird. \n\n\nThanks everyone for your support. And to everyone who sent me DMs. I'm gonna take myself on my own celebration for a do over like someone suggested. ",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will be a rather long post, but I hope some people will take their time to read it.. Cause boy do I need advice\n\nI'm f21, and used to have a big friend group, going out for coffee or a beer for that sake during weekdays - and would be out every weekend. Because of some dumb reason they all turned their back against me (this was a bit over a year ago) Today I know they regret how they handled the situation, but I never got back in contact with them.\n\nLong story short, I met this girl half a year ago (f25) and she introduced me to a lot of people and I was back to the person I used to be, going out every weekend and meeting new people. But our friendship quickly started to drain me, and a lot of people told me to cut her off, and still do. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah and I quickly became each others best friend, but with that a big responsibility came. I had to constantly reassure her, that she was pretty enough, good enough, had a great personality and bla bla bla, you get the point. This would occur everytime we went out, and the whole ''vibe'' would be based on how insecure she felt that day. (Which most of the time were awful) she was the ''leader'' of the group, and things had to go her way.. so you can imagine how it is with a bad vibe. She would often lie, to get things her way, or be jealous/insecure when we went out since she always compared herself to me or sometimes others. This would make me feel bad, and I reassured her that people don't want me - but her. Her responds would always be ''You have to say that since you're my friend''.. But would still ask me to reassure her.\n\nFor a while I stopped, because I knew I would just get snarky responds but that would offend her\n\nOne night I just got enough of her bullshit, I had told her I wanted to go to an event for the longest time (Note I actually already had planned to go with a friend, she wanted to be invited so I did:)))))) and she reassured me that ''yeah ofc we would go'' But ofc she had to show off her new job, and when I asked when we would leave, she said ''yeah maybe later'' This girl wanted to go somewhere else because a boy she liked was there, I got told by one of our mutual friends who was with us that night, that Sarah asked her to tell me she didn't have money enough so that would be an excuse to not go LITERALLY TO THE GIRL I HAD PLANS WITH FIRST. Which hurt me and pissed me off at the same time, so I left and she got annoyed and started texting me. My response was that I got told these things, and she said it was a lie - I offered her multiple times to meet me outside so we could talk but that just got brushed over, at one point I texted ''I can't be friends with people who lies all the time'' This was not only her, but the whole group I was talking about and she knew that - she decided to block me on all social medias and refused to give me my stuff back. This was after we've been friends for about 4 months. I was very depressed at that time, not only had I lost her but the whole friend group.. I was back to square one and questioned myself, am I the reason why I'm losing friends all the time? I tried to keep my chin up, but my heart was hurtig lol.. 2-3 months later she hit me up on facebook, she apparently left the group since it was so toxic and met a guy while traveling, her reason for contacting me was she missed me, and our friendship.\n\nWe became friends again, but this time it was just the two of us - and long distance. I'll try to make this short but everything again has to go her way, we wanted to move and start traveling together, ofc to the country where the guy she met lives because she felt at home. Me being me I followed her and we traveled to London - we decided that we would go again, though I needed some time since I had an exam and couldn't book anything before. She only had to wait ONE FREAKING DAY, but she decided that right here, right now she would book everything and I told her multiple times that I couldn't just throw everything out of my hands and just leave, and that I'll book tomorrow. She got mad for me not understanding, and said my reaction isn't fair because she has a lot going on and she would just go with a friend. She said ''Everything is not about you, I have other people in my life!'' This was about a week ago and these words still kinda hurt (Note, it was our dream to get a job together in London) We haven't texted that much since she's in London right now, but when we do it's about her all the time, I told her today I got offered a job interview, her response was ''yay!'' And quickly changed the topic back to her and how she's going out bowling with other people tonight.. I'm thinking like.. okay :/ what do you want me to say? It's like this all the time and at this point I don't know if I'm jealous, or just annoyed there's so much more but I'll make a list cause this is.. too long\n\n* Everything has to go her way\n* Very bipolar, and has psychotic issues. tho this shouldn't stop someone from being friends the bipolar is just.. a lot\n* Knows how to make you feel bad and will do it on purpose\n* Once said her friend thought I was hot, and that she liked him but in a friendly way.. Few days later she took him home and had sex. I wonder why? :)))\n* Gets jealous if someone likes me\n* Recently got mad because I talked to this guy at the club, who she liked (she literally has a man, tho not official) And we went downstairs to get beer, note how she never told me she liked him since we literally met him THAT night, and he doesn't even like girls\n* Her problems takes up a lot of time, and I feel like I'm only here for her to vent\n* Proceeds to go back to the guy she vents about, and I just feel like my time is wasted ngl (We sometimes chat for 3 hours about this whole problem)\n* Gets mad when I don't respond when online and spam\n* Gets mad if I skip over her question, or don't hype her up\n* Will ACTUALLY stalk u, and see if you're online if you don't respond\n\nNow you may ask ''Why don't you just cut her off?'' And the thing is I love her, and I now she loves me. For the first time I feel like I found a best friend, where I'm also theirs. Most of the time she makes me feel included and would do mostly anything for me. But I do feel drained at this point, but I'm also scared to just cut her off and be alone, what if I'm just the problem? Would love to hear u guys opinion\n\nIdk what to do, or how to feel - I feel like everything is my fault\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* My friend is draining me, I hate myself for it and I don't know what to do",

        "text": " \n\nI have been with my girlfriend for over 5 years now, and she has been asking for me to pop the question a lot, especially lately. We don't have a lot of problems, we have been to couples counseling before for arguing, but almost everyone we know refers to us as a dream couple. We have the same hobbies, we do pretty much everything together, we live together, we have the same sense of humor, etc.\n\nSo whats the problem?\n\nPart of it is, and there is no way to say this without seeming like a bad person and being vain, but I am just finding myself less and less attracted to her. She is not bad looking by any means, but physical attraction was never what made us get together and she was never my type, I was just amazed by how chill and fun she was and how well we normally get along. The other part is things shes does have been annoying me more often than they used to and becoming harder to overlook. She is a very headstrong and type A personality, so I pretty much always have to let her lead otherwise conflict arises. This has lead to a dent in my confidence as I feel less \"manly\" and \"in control\" sometimes even though I know that is ridiculous and somewhat misogynistic. It just kind of feels like what she says goes and if I argue I will always lose, so I just don't speak up sometimes which leads to internalized problems like these.\n\nWe still have sex slightly less than weekly, and its normally pretty good, but she doesn't get me going as much as other girls have in the past and the excitement I feel seeing other girls never went away. I was with dozens of girls before, and it was when I was at my most confident. Obviously that lifestyle shouldn't be permanent but I feel if I had to date again now would be the time as I'm more than halfway through my twenties and if I wait too long it seems to only get worse.\n\nLogically, it makes almost complete sense to marry her. We have built a pretty good life together, we live together, we have a cat we both adore, we have both become fully immersed into each others families, I already know what ring she wants, we do everything together, etc.\n\nBut would I be making the worst or best decision of my life if I didn't marry her, which would I guess mean leaving her? I can not imagine leaving her and this life we have, but I can't imagine marrying someone unless I have complete confidence in the decision and I just don't right now. She has been waiting for years so the pressure is only getting worse and I don't know how much longer she can wait.\n\nI have been feeling this awful indecisiveness for over a year and it is eating me alive. I truly do not know what the right decision is. I have even considered things like polyamory but I doubt she would ever go for that. Do I suck it up and marry someone that mostly makes sense and would put so much less strain on my life, or do I risk it all for the excitement of dating again and the possibility I'd be happier?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My GF wants me to propose ASAP and I am more scared than excited on if I am making the right decision",

        "text": "So I 35(f) am engaged to my 35(m) boyfriend of 12 years. We have not been doing well romantically and intimately and are in therapy together to try to sort things out. I feel like he’s holding on to our relationship with a death grip, because we are pretty codependent and now have a young child, but it has been feeling increasingly like he doesn’t actually like me as a person. I have always felt like I am just a terrible and annoying person, because of an abusive upbringing, so any time I felt this from him I felt like I understood why he wouldn’t like me or would think I’m annoying or too much to deal with. Now that I’m healing my trauma it seems more and more like I chose a partner who is in a lot of ways similar to my caregivers as a child who really messed me up. He is not abusive but I feel emotionally neglected all the time, manipulated and that his love for me is at times conditional. I have tried everything I can possibly think of to get him to stop taking me for granted, to show him there are issues that need his immediate attention and that my love for him is slowly dying. \n\nIt took him over a year of constant fighting and me pleading, to agree to couples therapy and he says he thinks it’s helpful and valuable, but I feel like there’s been hardly any significant changes and several of the changes I have seen have not been consistent. In a lot of our sessions I feel like he just wastes the whole hour creating untrue narratives about his part in the issues and then we end up going back and forth about this made up narrative and are not really getting anywhere. \n\nI feel so exhausted. Every time I try to tell him I’m at the end of my patience with xyz happening, he then seems to somehow make it all about me and how I’m not sure I want to be in the relationship anymore and that’s why there’s a problem. Every time I tell him when he hurts me emotionally he makes me explain it in excruciating detail and it feels like I have to argue why what happened hurt me. I feel neglected and alone so often it contributes heavily to my depression and self esteem issues, that I have been working really hard on improving. Any time I call him out for , what feels to me like gas lighting/ manipulation or lying , he just tells me it was not his intention and so it’s not actually gas lighting or lying/ manipulation. \n\nI told him recently that looking back it hurts me that he has seemingly never supported any of my ambitions and in some cases did the opposite of encouraging me. I just keep looking back at past and more present instances where the way he has treated me, if he were anyone else, I would assume they do not like me fundamentally. \n\nI think the most depressing part lately is that he waited for 12 years to propose to me and we have been engaged for almost a year. Neither of us want a big or expensive wedding, but he won’t set a date. I have told him numerous times for almost our whole engagement I wanted to get married at the end of this year on a specific significant date and he doesn’t seem to care and has given no indication he has thought about it in any significant way.\n\nI promised I would stick with therapy and not just walk away without warning, but I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I feel myself slipping back into a deep depression where I just cry all the time and can’t seem to enjoy anything except sleeping. I have talked to him directly in therapy and outside of it about pretty much all of this and nothing seems to change.\n\n\nTL/DR my fiancé doesn’t seem to like me as a person but likes our relationship and life together. I am feeling depressed about the thought he doesn’t like me as a person. Therapy and direct talks do not seem to make any difference. Am I misreading the situation maybe because of my mental health? Am I wasting my time waiting for things to get better? Or am I rally just an insufferable person who should be thankful to have a relationship at all? Am I looking at this all the wrong way?",

I dont know if Im being paranoid or if im valid in this concern, but some of the things he does towards some of them in particular rub me the wrong way. The first couple times we were hanging out he told me a bunch of his woman friends are after him but he isnt really interested in them like that. Comepletely unsolicsited comment by the way. We were in the middle of talking about chickpeas. He sprung that on me out of no where. He has admitted to me having crushes on some of his woman friends in the past as well. But he remains platonic with them today. Theres this one woman who I think its kinda obvious he likes, though I havent interacted with them both in the same room enough to tell. I do know his reactions to her when talking about her or when shes not around makes me slightly uncomfortable even if they, in isolation, are nothing glaring. One time he saw her car parked and got really excited and rushed to park right next to hers. There was one time he was talking about her tattoos and how he admired them and how he wanted to get tattoos similiar to that. One time we were hanging out and he said he remembered her saying she wanted some soup earlier that day, so he called her while we were on our date and asked if she wanted the soup she wanted earlier cuz he wanted to pick some up for her. Then there was the time he was showing off this cool tshirt to me he really liked. Come to find out the tshirt was her handmedown he brought off her. \nI brought it up to him and he hasnt spoken to me in a week. I dont know if I was overreacting and that turned him off or summn. How should I approach him again? \n\n\nTl;dr guy Im seeing has weird boundaries w some of his girl friends. Idk if Im overreacting though.",

He does not story/post often, seldom will stories a pics of his brother, music etc.. It looks like he used to story and post a lot more before I met him.\n\nI have spoke to him numerous times, he says he will do it by X date and just doesn't follow through. I even had a breakdown about the past recently, and needing him to go out of his way to make me feel more secure and do thing like this. He said he felt really dumb for not doing it yet, that he wants to do it, will do it by X date but he missed the deadline AGAIN.\n\nObviously, I know him best and I think this somehow has to do with his own insecurities. Other details: It would not be because he is embarrassed of my appearance. He does introduce me to his friends/family.",

Like I talk to her and it's like I'm talking to my mom it just doesn't work anymore. But the problem is we do every single sport together and our families do everything together. She's still super super into it but idk I just like being single. I plan on ending it over the summer maybe but that's a long time away and idk what to do. And she's friends with all of my friends and their families. So even if I end it we will still see each other all the time and that's kinda awkward. And she doesn't have much friends but she says that's ok because she has me. But idk I want out I don't like having the responsibilities of a relationship and it takes all the energy out of me.

I have no real dating experience and limited relationship experience. the first date went well, she was brushing up on my shoulder and i felt all was good. asked her out for another date a couple days later. it went well, we held hands at the bar. we made our intentions clear, we both want a relationship. this is where it gets rough for me. her \"best friend\" is a coworker ive known for five years and dont like him. we are civil but hes very immature and has wronged me in the past. apparently i talked too much shit about him. But after the second date we went back to her place, drank some more. made out and i spent the night. she even asked me to take my pants off to get more comfortable.. but we both agreed to not have sex. woke up had coffee, hung out for the day. i made a couple stupid comments throughout the day, she said so were dating now? and i asked about her single fb status being single. not differentiating dating vs official. she was having said friend pick her up, at the end of our date i made a comment saying wouldn't it be funny if he saw me leaving when he picks you up. she didn't text me the majority of the next day then \"breaks up\" because i was moving too fast and the fact that they are close \"Clearly bothers me\". i wish i could redo it all because i really did like her. i know im glorifying her but this is my first real time dating and its a hurting rn. side note that she talked about getting out of a pretty abusive 8 month relationship. luckily in my job its easy to avoid each other. maybe its a good thing as if it didn't get brought up now, maybe it would have got brought up later when i was even more attached. its just brutal as i feel like she was one of the first really attractive women to show any interest in me. id love to here your input. i know its only been two dates... not the end of the world.. just a new experience to me. is the best play to avoid her at work? or act like nothing ever happened?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - took a coworker out on a couple dates, thought it went well, she broke up with me because i was moving too fast and i didnt like her best friend at work ive known for years.",

He recently got this job- it pays him better than he has ever seen and I am so happy for him because it’s an automotive job (which he is a car enthusiast). I had my job first and it pays me alright as a woman that loves to help and working with people of disabilities. \n\nWe have come to a pickle where, I’ll wake up in the morning and he’s gone for work. When he gets home, I’m at work already. Once I get off - he is already asleep. So I never get to talk about my day or visit with him Monday through Friday. On the weekends he expresses he needs to make time for family and friends. Which feels like to me he prioritizes first. \n\nI’ve asked to spend a bit more time together on weekends or little as play with my hair to help me sleep once getting home when I have my chronic migraines. He expresses he is being asked to much and I “nag” and I have no respect for his rest or life outside of me. I’ve tried to tone down and let things be what they are but then he says I’m detaching. He starts to not answer my texts through the day and distance himself when he sees I stop “nagging” because if “ I’m on that shit then he is too”.\n\nHe has been on the line of breaking up and so have I because it feels like we have “no time” for a relationship. But we both don’t want to be without each other. He has gotten emotional about the importance of each other  but he doesn’t make an effort???\n\nDo I want this relationship more? and do I continue to detach to self prioritize or do I see this through to make a sacrifice for someone I love? \n\nHe also likes to make time to work on his own project car which creates more of a distance between him and I. I am more introverted and don’t like to make useless friends and be friendly with acquaintances- but he does. So I am more available than him but I do it for a desire of him and valuable time together. \n\nTL;DR He makes me feel like I control him or want to posses him but I feel like I’m asking for almost the bare minimum? Am I being THAT girl?? I can’t ask close friends because they will do the “fuck him girl and move on” but I want HIM.",

        "text": "Please help me unpack this - maybe an external perspective will help.\n\nI'm a woman, 39, and I really value friendships. For me nurturing friednships is more important right now (and really has always been) than having a relationship (I'm single and happily so).\n\nAside from my historical best friend (F38), who I have known since we were 6 and with whom I have the best relationship I could ever hope for, for many years I didn't have female friends and always missed it. I had a good circle of female friends in highschool and university, but when I moved abroad and started working in male-dominated sectors I struggled to make female friends. Recently I've spent more time on and off in my home village and made some new female friends, which I was over the moon about! I've always loved having male friends too, and still do, but there is something about a group of ladies together that is just unique.\n\nWhen I was younger I struggled at times with some potential female friendships due to the classic jealousy situation. At the time, I was very good looking (looking back I can now say this, I never felt it at the time!), and used to get a lot of male attention, this was usually the cause. Because I struggled with the male attention anyway, I started to develop \"strategies\" to discourage men while appearing less intimdating as possible to women: downplaying myself, pointing out my flaws, showing up scruffy, etc.\n\nThen with time I realised this is not a healthy strategy, and I actually need to be myself around friends and I do like to dress nicely and be put together. However, I kept my \"discouraging\" attitude towards male attention: I don't flirt, I think I actually forgot how to do it, and I don't try to appear sexy in any way or to make any even remotely sexual joke (unless with someone I'd like to be in a relationship or hook up with - very infrequent occurrance these days, because I'm also experiencing a time of celibacy for spiritual reasons). This helps me keep my male friends friends only and discourage them from developing sexual or romantic feelings towards me. \n\nFast forward to me finally having a good number of female friends. They are all in relationships, and those whose boyfriends I only know as their boyfriends everything is ok. However, there seem to be issues with those who get together with my male friends. \n\nOne female friend (35) asked me to introduce her to one of my long time male friends (32) and I did. They got together and it turned out a disaster, she got extremely jealous and told him I was saying horrible stuff about him to others, all starting because I sent him a text to organise a get together and she thought it was for me and him only. It wasn't, since they got together I immediately stopped hanging out with him alone, even though we had been close friends for five years, exactly for the reason of not wanting to cross any line. I also drastically reduced contact with him from weekly texts and phone calls, to only one phone call over a couple of months. This is just to say, I think I did absolutely nothing to make anyone alarmed. I kindly explained the invite was for both, but she thought I wanted him and was trying to make him fall for me, and demanded he stopped talking to me. He did and I accepted it, but I discovered later, this created a damage between them and they kept arguing about me (I had since disappeared from both of their lives, never reaching out to either of them), until they eventually broke up.\n\nNow, another female friend (42), and this one I really worshipped, has got together with one of my male friends (45). They are a gorgeous couple, so in love, both so bright and attractive, it's pure joy to see them together. Again, I've only hang out with them as a couple, never alone with him. He writes to me a bit more often than her and I make sure if I'm texting with him, I also text with her so that she doesn't feel I'm closer to him than her (even though I sort of was because I've known him longer). To organise hanging out I created a group chat to avoid misunderstandings, having learnt my lesson. And now, still, she's got really cold towards me and it turns out she feels threathened. She has started analyse my behaviour and found tiny clues that would indicate I'm interested in him, apparently I responded slightly faster to his texts than hers, but what really pissed her off was that he invited me to go out with him and a group of his friends while she was away for the weekend (I refused and didn't go). She's basically stopped talking to me. \n\nI'm starting to feel really hurt over this. Once was already a lot, but twice it means I'm obviously still doing something wrong, even taking all of these measures doesn't seem enough, and we are not kids, we are all over 35. The first lady I was only just getting to know her when the mess happened and we didn't have much in common, but this last one, I really cared about her and really opened up to her. I never had the faintest interest in her boyfriend, and never had the slightest flirty attitude towards him. I'm not even feeling that sexual lately at all and I'm quite disinterested in men in general these days, so it's not even something I have to force myself to do, I'm not oozing any kind of weird pheromone. Also this lady is stunning, way more good looking than me, so it can't be that. I'm now distancing myself from both to let them live their relationship in paece, but the male friend expressed that he is mortified by this, I suspect it will become an issue between them too. It feels absurd this is the second relationship I ruin wanting to do the complete opposite. I'm starting to feel I need to flee whenever two friends  get together. I'm not overpresent in their lives either, I live part of the year abroad and when back I try to also catch up on family relationships and I spend a lot of time with my nephew and niece. \n\nIs there a blind spot I'm not noticing? Anyone with experience of this unvoluntary triangles? \n\n\\---  \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : In spite of my efforts, I keep causing jealousy and losing female friends that get in relationships with my male friends  - what I am doing wrong?",

She’s sweet, funny, attractive and I love being with her. At first, I was confident in saying yes to dating but am having second thoughts and I feel terrible about it.\n\nThe last two years have been very centered in trying to improve my confidence, self esteem etc. after a bad breakup. Part of my desire to improve came from my lack of ability to flirt, which sounds really stupid, but I’ve always been extremely socially awkward so getting better was a big part for me. In the months leading up to meeting this girl I’d been talking to a few different people and was having a lot of fun finally being able to comfortably talk to girls and people in general. It was like I had discovered a new ability and wanted to play around with it a little bit, which sounds so incredibly douchey, but my social anxiety had always prevented me from even thinking about talking to someone.\n\nAfter we started dating, I felt like I had spent so long been working up this ability to finally have fun flirting with people, only to put it to rest a few weeks after finding success. I’m totally obsessed with this girl and would never be unfaithful, but still have this desire to “test out” my ability to talk and flirt with people. I feel like an asshole for even thinking this way, but I know it’s not fair to either of us. Does anyone have any tips on how to confront this feeling?\n\nTLDR; started dating a girl and I really like her, but feel like I’m not ready to stop talking to other people after spending so much time trying to improve my confidence with flirting.",

        "text": "TLDR: Girlfriend said I manipulated her into taking birth control pills, and now isn't willing to use any form of birth control whatsoever, and I am looking for a way to approach talking to her about this and finding a solution.\n\nMe and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and when me and my girlfriend first started dating, every time we had sex i'd put a condom on, and had absolutely 0 problem with it. A couple months in she asked if we could try it unprotected and though I was extremely weary due to the fact I have anxiety and stuff like this will make me stress about the fact I am going to have a child until her period comes, I eventually agreed to doing it one time.\n\nAfter this first time she kept telling me how much better it was, and although I agreed I did not want to risk impregnating her, and made that clear to her, so she offered to go on birth control, so we could have unprotected sex without the risk of a child. I asked her a couple times about when she was actually gonna go on the pills and every time she would say something like \"at my next doctors appointment\" and eventually she got around to going to the doctors appointment and taking the birth control pills. A couple weeks into taking the pills, she was not in a good place mentally, which is not uncommon for her due to some mental health issues. This particular time though she blamed me for \"pressuring\" her into taking the pills which she believed was the cause for this episode, even though she never showed any form of resistance to taking it, and essentially blamed it all on me saying, she never wanted to take it and it would make her \"fat, unhappy, etc\".\n\nAfter this I backed off quite a bit, and just started to use condoms again, which I again have no problem with, the only thing is that my girlfriend says that condoms make sex too painful for her and having it unprotected is the only way that she wants to have it. Now each time we have sex we track her cycle and have sex in the least fertile times and try to get a plan b after having sex. As a broke college student i've already probably spent $500+ on plan b's and it isn't sustainable at all and I really don't wanna risk pregnancy. Now when I bring it up I don't bring up the birth control pills but I try to have an open discussion about what we should do to prevent pregnancy, but she always kinda shuts it down and tries to change the subject, and I really don't want to go through her blaming me and calling me manipulative, but these conversations lead no where, I try to give all the options but nothing works for her, the pills affect her mentally too much and will make her \"fat\", condoms hurt too much and i've even suggested using lube or finding a different type of condom, but apparently she doesn't want any foreign object down there at all, she's too scared of how painful an iud is going to be, and literally the only thing she is fine with is a plan b, which isn't realistic financially nor is it good for her body to be constantly messing with the hormones. I personally don't feel like i'm in the wrong because we're far too young to have children, and i'm not getting a vasectomy at 19 years old, but I still have no idea how to bring this up without her instantly blaming me for not caring. Any tips on how I should bring this up?",

I was instantly mad because i'm not even unfit and i have a decent body and he's never actually mentioned anything like that before.

I really want to go be with this man?!\n\nIt sounds crazy objectively, to have someone you slept with 6 years ago fly you out to meet/kinda sorta maybe do stuff. \n\nIs this something most moral people would be disgusted at? I feel shameful for wanting a man who is in a relationship. \n\nTLDR: Guy (34m) I (24f) slept with 6 years ago wants to fly me out but he is in a relationship",

        "text": "This is my first time posting and English isn't my first language so sorry in advance.\n\nMy current relationship of 10 months had a rocky start. My mistake was having a fwb with his roommate and I deeply regret it. After 2 months of having that fwb I started doing more with my now boyfriend (we knew each other for about 1 year until that time). We have common interests like cooking etc. so it felt really natural. And I never thought it could come to us having a relationship, that's why I never thought about the consequences of having a fwb at that time.\n\nSo when I realized that I am about have a real relationship with my bf I started pushing him away. I had the fear of missing out so I had all sorts of excuses for him and myself, but he was still trying. I was \"frustrated\", and randomly confessed my feelings to fwb while being super drunk and he rejected me. My bf heard of it from other people and was devastated. After that I kind of came to my senses with the help of my friends. He forgave me and we went low contact with fwb even though they are friends.\n\nNow we're in a relationship and everything is normal again between me, my bf and fwb. But because of his past relationship (his girlfriend promised to wait for him after he went to USA for a year abroad but got into a relationship with his best friend instead) he has trust issues and our start just feeds into his insecurities.\n\nHe sometimes has nightmares about me cheating with fwb but I don't know how to tackle that. We're planing to talk about everything that happened so far the next time we meet. But I don't know what else to do. I know I was acting in a irresponsible way in regards of his feelings and I apologized to him many times.I want to make it up to him so bad and I feel so guilty. How can we tackle this situation? I have a feeling that just talking about our past isn't enough.\n\nTL;DR: I messed up the start of our relationship and because of trust issues he has from hist past relationships, he has nightmares and is sad overall.",

        "text": "\n31F 32M\nLast November, I finally started putting myself out there and tried online dating. Ive never really dated anyone due to body image issues etc (I lost over 30 lbs in the last few years). I met a great guy who had a few mutual friends. He had just gotten out of a 4yr relationship about 2 months prior to this (his ex dumped him), but he had told our mutual friends he was over it and ready to date. We really connected, he said I was \"special\", told his friends and family about me, talked about future plans etc. I don't have much experience, but looking back I guess we moved pretty fast. We dated for about a month (6 dates), had lots of cuddles and just talked for hours when we were together. It seemed to be going really well. We had sex about 3 weeks into dating, and it ended up being really awkward- neither of us finished and it just felt weird. Ive only had sex with one other guy and it was more of a one night stand thing- but that time the sex felt more \"connected\" than with this guy. I found it weird because leading up to it, I figured sex with someone I really had feelings for would be amazing. I think my lack of experience had something to do with it, but I still wonder exactly what happened and if maybe we weren't sexually compatible? Or maybe he realized he wasn't over his ex once we got intimate? I say that because at one point during sex I apologized for not really knowing what to do- and he said \"its not you- its me.\" And at one point he stopped mid sex and said he needed a minute, he got up and left the room and came back a few minutes later (he was still hard so it wasn't that he went to finish on his own or anything)\nAfter our night of awkward sex, I just felt a little embarrassed and awkward in general. I told him I thought it would be better the next time if we tried again, and he said \"you're probably right\". But in the week after the hookup, I noticed his texts were more dry and it was always me initiating/asking questions to him. He didn't really try to continue our convos via text. This made me really sad/I felt like he was just throwing me away easily because we had one bad night. It was confusing because his feelings prior to this seemed SO strong. He had initiated all of our prior dates, but hadn't brought anything up so I asked him if we could hang out again. He agreed, and we hung out the next week. When we hung out I was planning on talking about the awkward night etc but I just felt so embarrassed so I never it brought it up (and neither did he). Our conversation on this hangout was really superficial. I know I wasn't acting myself because of how embarrassed I was. I really wish I would have tried to have a deeper conversation with him on this date. I have so many questions for him now, but feel like it's too late to have a conversation about it now.\nAfter the last date, he continued to be dry via text. So instead of continuously overthinking everything, I decided to just straight up ask him if we wasn't feeling it anymore. He responded: \"Its true I haven't been feeling it lately. I think we have both been very busy recently. Im open to hanging out more to see how we feel. But the feelings aren't very strong so maybe thats a sign\". This text killed me, because it validated all of my feelings and made me feel like an idiot. I felt like he used me for sex and never really cared about me. Ive never been so hurt. I backed off after this response. About a week later he snap chatted me personal inside joke. I didn't respond. I was so confused on why he would do that if he had just hurt me? About a week later I was missing him so sent him a few snap chats- he replied to all of them.\nOver the next month, we didn't text at all. I continued to send snap chats here and there and he would always reply but he never sent me any more snaps after the personal one. One night I texted him because a mutual friend asked about him and I had told him she asked about him. He responded saying: \"Honestly you caught me at a strange time in my life. I think you're a great girl, i think it's that i just came out of a relationship and I don't know what to do\".\nAfter that text, Ive just been confused. I don't know why he would send the that a month after he told me he wasn't interested. Why was it necessary for him to tell me that? That text did make me feel like he maybe did like me, but the timing just wasn't right? I'm not sure how to read it or what it means. Was he trying to tell me I was a rebound? Its driving me crazy trying to figure out exactly what he meant!\nIts been about 2 months since that last text. We dont really talk, except I send him snaps about once a month and he always replies and we talk a little though there. But nothing else really. I dont know why but I still think about him every day. Im not sure if its because I want him back, or because I dont really know his true feelings or exactly what happened/why it all ended. Im just so hurt, especially because I finally put myself out there and feel like it all blew up in my face. I have nothing to compare this to and now feel like Im going to make the same mistakes in the future because I dont really know what I did wrong :( I feel like theres something wrong with me and maybe Im just meant to be alone forever. I feel like this guy realized something about me that he hated, and I dont know what it is.\n\n\nIve been thinking about asking to meet up to talk with him as friends. But i dont know if this will come off as desperate, and I dont know how awkward I would feel if we actually did meet up. I feel like maybe I wouldn't have the courage to even ask him all of the questions I want to ask him. I just really want to know what happened. Part of me thinks maybe I was a rebound, then part of me thinks it was something wrong with me or something I said or did. Its just so weird because he was so into me and then all of a sudden it was over.\n\n\nTLDR: 31F 32M Dated briefly for a month and moved pretty fast. He was only 2 months out of a 4yr relationship. He lost interest after sex but continued to keep in touch. Not sure If I should ask for closure or let it go.",
