For example you play some life sim, you play for what feels like 24 hours but just an hour of real time passes.

Climate change, shrinking populations due to sperm count reduction and younger generations having fewer children, global supply chains have shown their inherent weakness, global debt outpacing global GDP, global oil supplies have ~50 years estimated at current rates of use, etc... Investing in the stock market has been the standard for growing wealth and securing your retirement, but this exponential growth is proving to be unsustainable and its questionable that anything could truly keep growing. Even just from a resource depletion perspective, market growth will at some point catch up to resource limitations, but many other factors could affect the market in bigger ways.\n\nFor younger people, do you see 401k and long term stock market investing as viable for retirement? My immediate reaction, colored by the last 100 years is yes, it's the safe bet, but I'm looking for a little deeper digging. It feels like all the easy ways of exponential growth have been tapped and 8-12% average yearly returns that occurred during the time period of off shoring of labor, tax cuts, and automation is a thing of the past. What are your thoughts on long term viability of these 'tried and true' methodologies of wealth growth going into the future?",
