I am now totally overwhelmed and confused. I’d like to have a simple two stage manufacturing process that then also handles sales inventory, updating stock for Bricks and then e-commerce. I’d also like to be able to pull sales data from it all. At the moment I think we will use a large selling platform(woo commerce) and then something like Airtable or Odoo that will speak to Woo and hopefully use airtable or payments company as our POS. I’d like to be able to get as much data as possible at every level to hopefully drive further efficiencies and analysis as possible. \n\nShould I find a consultant to ask about all this in more detail? How do I do that and what kind of costs are involved. Is this the kind of project I should use Upwork for? Is upwork the best place to go? \n\nThe short answer is I’m Totally out of my depth and can’t even work out if I’ve got the budget to do it at all. Any and all advice gratefully received.",

        "text": " \n\nOver the past three to four years, our organization has been working to enhance our Agile practices. While this journey has had its ups and downs, it has given us value to be more iterative.\n\nFirst, I would like to provide some context to better understand the situation. I am part of the IT software development leadership team, and my software engineering teams are all organized into scrum teams, consisting of a Product Owner, Analysts, Scrum Master, Developers, and Quality Assurance specialists. Our sprint cycles are two weeks long. Engineers work on a feature branch and deploy it to a DEV environment where it is tested with other features. The engineers then promote the changes to our QA environment where the QA testers will perform their testing.\n\nOne of the recurring challenges brought to my attention is that during the two-week sprint, the developers consume most of the sprint on feature development, leaving limited time towards the end of the sprint for the Quality Assurance team to conduct their testing. I decided to sit in on a grooming session with one of the teams that have these challenges and one of the things I observed was that the PO was grooming tickets with a large number of acceptance criteria (8 - 12 bullet points of criteria for the ticket to be marked as complete). I asked the PO if she could refine that ticket into smaller workable user stories so the developers could deliver smaller features over to QA as soon as they complete the user story's feature.\n\nI have engaged in discussions with several IT stakeholders and the following are some of the outcomes of those discussions. I would be grateful for feedback from others who have selected any of the potential options listed below for their own use and how it has worked out for their scrum teams.\n\n\\*\\*\\* **Option 1 \\*\\*\\***\n\nImplement a Shift-Left Approach for the Quality Assurance (QA) Team. This approach would involve the QA engineer starting the testing process early in the software development cycle, potentially testing in the feature branch or the development environment. As a result, the QA team would not have to wait until the code is promoted to the QA environment. Additionally, the QA team would be working closely with the developers from the outset, potentially assisting in the creation of automated unit tests for the feature.\n\n\\*\\*\\* **Option 2 \\*\\*\\***\n\nInstead of shifting left with option 1, ensure the team is refining the user stories small enough so the developers can work on smaller features (ones that might take only a 1 to 2 days) and quickly promoting those features into the QA environment for QA to begin testing as early as day 3.\n\n\\*\\*\\* **Option 3 \\*\\*\\***\n\nOption 1 &amp; 2 - Refine User Stories and Implement a Shift-Left Approach for the Quality Assurance (QA) Team. The objective of this combined approach is to break down user stories into smaller, manageable features that can be completed within 1 to 2 days by the developers. At the same time, the QA team would start testing the features early in the software development cycle, either directly from the developer's feature branch or in the development environment, rather than waiting for the code to be promoted to the QA environment.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe only concern with shifting left for us is that I understand that to shift left, you need to practice automated testing as much as possible, and implementing TDD would also be helpful. Otherwise, your QA is going to be spending a lot of time manually validating in several places (feature branch, DEV environment, and the QA environment).",

The user enters their phone number, they are sent a verification code through Twilio.\n2. The user enters the verification code and assuming the verification code is correct, the user is either navigated to the home page, or a different page to provide their name and email if they are a new user.\n3. If they are a new user, they enter their name and email and then are navigated to the home page.\n\nLogin/Registration flow backend:\n\n1. A **non-authorized** endpoint that accepts a phone number as a parameter, requests a verification code text be sent to that number.\n2. A **non-authorized** endpoint that accepts a phone number and verification code as a parameter, confirms that the verification code is valid,  and checks if the phone number exists in the Users table. If the phone number exists, then return a JWT (with the user\\_id as a claim), and a boolean that says the user is not new. If the phone number does not exist, then Insert the User into the table, and return a JWT (with the new user\\_id as a claim), and a boolean that says the user is new.\n3. An **authorized** endpoint that accepts no parameters (uses JWT), to update the Users table with the user's name and email.  \n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Would it be bad practice to use the INSERT in my Users table as a way to determine if the user is new or not instead of doing a separate SELECT query to check if the phone number exists in my Users table (phone number is a unique constraint)? I imagine I could just catch the duplicate key error that is thrown on the INSERT, instead of doing two separate queries to the DB.\n2. Should my endpoint that requests a verification code to a phone number be authorized in some way? I could imagine some outside caller potentially spamming that endpoint to send verification codes to random numbers.\n3. If I use a JWT, I shouldn't ever need to pass the User ID as a request parameter right? Or is it bad practice to use the JWT to carry the User ID around?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification about something I said. Thanks in advance for any help!",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello Reddit Community,\n\nAre you someone who has always been fascinated by the world of software engineering and is looking to start a career in the field, but feels held back by the idea of needing a traditional university degree? Well, I have some great news for you! The world of technology is rapidly evolving, and with it, the way we approach education and career development.\n\nIn today's society, we have numerous resources and opportunities to learn and grow our skills, regardless of whether we hold a traditional university degree or not. With the rise of online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy, anyone with the drive and determination can learn the skills needed to become a software engineer.\n\nThat being said, it's important to note that becoming a software engineer is not an easy feat. It takes time, effort, and a willingness to continuously learn and adapt. But, with hard work and dedication, you can gain the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this dynamic field.\n\nSo, the real question is, do companies hire software engineers without a degree? The answer is yes! While a traditional university degree may be a preferred requirement for some companies, many are open to hiring individuals who have gained their skills through self-study, online courses, or bootcamps. Companies are becoming more focused on the skills and abilities of potential hires rather than just their education background.\n\nIn conclusion, while a traditional university degree may give you a solid foundation in software engineering, it's not the only way to start a career in the field. So, if you're ready to dive into the world of software engineering, don't let a lack of a degree hold you back. Take advantage of the numerous resources available to you and start learning today!\n\nShare your thoughts and experiences in the comments below, and if you're interested in learning more, check out my latest blog on this topic [https://medium.com/@has06/becoming-a-software-engineer-without-a-degree-exploring-the-possibilities-a72aa737c0b4](https://medium.com/@has06/becoming-a-software-engineer-without-a-degree-exploring-the-possibilities-a72aa737c0b4).\n\nLooking forward to the discussion!",

(\"Log in, navigate to this page, create an entry, go back to the home screen and check for the update\"). Is that even correct??\n\nBUT INTEGRATION TESTING??? How the heck do I know what to test? There seem to be dozens of instances where two modules might interact. For example, I might have my API routes defined, call the business logic, which calls on the database layer. Do I check API layer &amp; Service layer, Service layer \\* DB layer, DB layer &amp; actual db instance separately (four tests)? What if the API layer uses two different services? Or is it enough to have a one integration test per API route?\n\nEven unit testing a service layer function might call on the database layer. Is this a separate integration test? \n\nAlso I have been storing unit tests next to the referenced code. Where do folks even place integration tests? In a tests directory with its own structure? (Some feature test directory -&gt; multiple test files that involve that feature ?)\n\nI feel like folks with enough experience in the industry might pick up on how far to test / what it feasible / reasonable etc. just by working on large (and hopefully well maintained) code bases.

My title may say \"software developer\", but at 8 months in I've only JUST began writing code, and I could barely call that \"professional experience\". It's evident to me from the work of my tenured colleagues that this company has no future in software development, and I will be stuck working with some of the worst software on this planet (FactoryTalk, RSLogix, the likes) for the remainder of my time here if I don't leave.\n\nI fear for my chances of getting a job in the future and don't want to stay somewhere that is going backwards, so I believe the best time to leave is now.\n\nI've been applying steadily over the last 8 months to no avail, only 1 interview out of over 100+ applications. Granted I did very well in that interview and was, by their remark, in the top 5 out of 800 other applicants. Each application I send comprises of my resume and a catered cover letter filling in the above link with some personalized statements. But the fact remains that I'm getting nowhere and feel like I'm stuck in a rut. I just want out.\n\nPlease rail into my resume and cover letter, don't hold back. I want fully honest, critical judgements and detailed advice because I want to actually start my career and earn some real experience in my field.\n\nIf you notice any personal information still left in the forms, please let me know and I'll change them ASAP.",

In this implementation, I would have an events table with event types and body, and my primary projection would be the read-only data structure that preserves the application state.\n\nThis is how I roughly envision this system:\n\n[sql based event sourcing](https://preview.redd.it/yqirxns9f6ha1.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=020bec6406af88f89c239b74424a282472e2593e)\n\nBecause the system is not expected to ever exceed 10/req/s I wouldn't introduce any async actions or eventual consistency, but rather do every event update inside of a single transaction. \n\nFor example, this is how a typical controller would function;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;def create(params) do  \n&gt;  \n&gt;   res = transaction do  \n&gt;  \n&gt;event = create\\_and\\_save\\_event(params)  \nupdate\\_projection(event)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;end  \n     \n   if res == :success do  \nreturn http.201  \n   else  \nreturn res\\_to\\_http\\_code(res)  \n   end  \n&gt;  \n&gt;end\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I already anticipate is that uniqueness validation could be tricky, as well as looking up the history of a particular entity (ex. give me all changes for milestone ID=xyz) without storing its ID somewhere on the event.\n\nWhat is your take on this? \n\n* **Am I doing something very bad in this design?**\n* **Do you have some advice or warning about something that I am missing?** \n* **What is the best resource to educate myself further on this topic?**",

It was the end of the day and I suppose I was just exhausted, and was fairly confident that the code would work, so I approved it. The code was merged it pushed to a product that currently has no users and is still in the testing phase.\n\nThe code I approved did not work, and one of our lead developers wants to meet tomorrow to come up with a fix. I'm concerned he'll ask me why I didn't catch the error, so I plan on fully confessing. \n\nI'm saying all this because I feel like I've kinda squandered the trust that was placed in me as a code reviewer, and I'm worried I'll be reprimanded and punished for it. \n\nThis is new territory for me, so I guess I'm just posting here wondering if anyone has been through anything similar.",

The first two interviews went smoothly, but it was the third one that proved to be the challenge.\n\nThe third interview consisted of two parts: scoping tickets and product design and a coding challenge **unrelated** to the scoping tickets. Although the coding challenge was a breeze, I struggled a bit with the product design part (mostly because I don't really do that in my day to day job).\n\nTwo days later, I received this feedback: \"*The team felt that your experience was much more software engineering led rather than aligned with the product focused ways of working that \\*insert company name\\* adopt.*\"\n\nI am eager to improve my product-focused skills and was wondering if anyone could provide some recommendations on what I should read or do to improve in this area. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAlso, is this a common thing to be required from late junior/early mid level developers?\n\nThank you.",

For example:\n\n* Do they have like 3 teams \"core\", \"standalone\", \"cloud\" - and what are the % of engineers in each team? (VS the % of users on both product lines?)\n* Do they have policies to restrict the choice of technologies they rely on? For example use only portable, open-source technologies instead of proprietary ones (e.g. Rabbit instead of Azure Service Bus) ?\n* What's the impact on the solution architecture? Are you monolithic or fully containerized, using k8s as a runtime environment?\n* How do you keep the 2 product lines sync and up to date on the long term? How do you manage infrequent on-site updates VS a maybe continuous deployment for the cloud solution?\n* What about the customer support? Do you have 2 teams?

        "text": "So for starters, I’m in a situation where I’m a tech lead of a software group. What we have to work off of at the point are system requirements, that is very high-level requirements meant to apply to software, hardware, safety, security, test, and other groups working on this project. It’s our responsibility to write software requirements, design documents, and ultimately implement the software for this system.\n\nI think the way we’re doing this currently is wrong, but I’ve been overruled by one of the senior engineers on my team (that in itself is a complicated situation, but not the point of this post). Basically, what we ended up deciding to do was this:\n\nHigh level design of the software comes first. This is where people draw boxes with arrows and say generally how certain things will interact in software. We’re doing this before requirements because (quote) “how can you write requirements for software if you don’t even know how it’s going to be designed?” This is done only by senior engineers.\n\nAfter that, requirements are written. This is where we delve into exactly what particular software units need to input and output, as well as what information each data structure needs to contain. This is also the responsibility of senior engineers only. \n\nAfter that, we do low-level design. This consists of writing each function out with its parameters and returns, then writing pseudocode for that function. This is finally where the whole team contributes. \n\nFinally, we implement the low-level design exactly. Until we reach this point, no one has touched a real compiler. \n\nWe’re doing this iteratively in sprints, so all of that happens for small pieces of software in cycles.\n\nThe thing is, this seems wrong to me. What I think is this:\n\nSoftware requirements should precede design, even high-level design. Requirements should be conveying what the software needs to do regardless of how it’s designed.\n\nHigh-level design should bound the implementation, just as requirements should bound the design. Design should be our attempt at saying, “if we make software like this, all requirements will be met”. \n\nLow-level design as we do it should not exist. It’s no better than writing code on paper. The code documentation should cover this instead, and developers should be working with real compilers and tests by this point in order to create an implementation that works in the real world rather than in their own heads.\n\nThat’s the crux of it. What I want to ask is: Am I off base? If the way we’re doing it now really is better, then I’d appreciate an explanation as to why I’ve got it wrong. If not, then how do I explain/justify that what I’m proposing is a better way to go forward?",

Finished bootcamp, done 6 weeks of Leetcode after (80%easy, 20%medium). Then I got my first job (React mostly day to day development). After 6 months at that job I have gone through an extensive interview for a Backend Apprenticeship in another company and accepted the position. I have started in the beginning of the year. Currently in the new position I am asked to learn on my own, with my mentor explicitly being there just to do the overview, which is pick my tasks and making sure that I don’t mess up production environment. For the first 4 weeks, I wrote some code to replace some strings in JS and some Python code for hiding some personal info (Both of tasks ade deployed to prod.).\nNow the problem: I am not only learning a new language (Golang), but also a company’s project structure, flow, Redis usage, Aws Lambdas ans Events, writing unit tests, setting up metrics for error checking, and a lot more. I have 6 weeks until the decision is made and I have been told that because of the hiring freeze in the company the expectations are gonna be higher for the conversion to FT BE because it is considered an exception (pre-freeze rate was 80%). My biggest struggle is because I can learn fast when someone shows me something (or explains it) once, but figuring everything on my own takes more time. I feel really stressed although I like the company and the work. I know that for a Backend Engineer expectations are high but is it realistic to learn this much in less than 3 months? Does anyone have any suggestions or advice, should I start applying to other jobs just in case?\n\nThank you in advance",

        "text": "I feel like an idiot.\n\nAt work I was tasked with writing a launcher for a bunch of independent linux processes that we are developing. We wanted to support launching them, cleaning up system files that they left hanging around (for various reasons they couldnt clean up after themselves), and searching and modifying config files enmasse. It's a developer convenience thing that would end up on every dev's machine.\n\nWe also wanted to support both WSL and remote Linux boxes from a single client. Ultimately I settled on a TCP solution: An agent would run on the remote board, and the launcher would connect to it in a client/server configuration. \n\nWe wanted the launcher to be extensible, so I wrote an XML schema and a parser that allowed us to add new apps to the launcher without changing any code.\n\n\nThe launcher would parse the XML, generate start/stop controls for each app, and then send commands to the agent running on the remote machine who would in turn start and stop them, as well as return status messages about the processes and clean up after them as they start up and shut down.\n\nThe problem? The commands were unencrypted plain-text including the locations of binaries on the remote machine, and exact config parameters to run them with. The TCP server would run whatever the connected peer told it to, in whatever folder was passed.\n\nI created a TCP server that could run arbitrary commands received as plaintext on a remote machine, with no login required. All a hacker would need to do is open a wireshark instance, sniff the packets, and then they'd know everything they needed to know to make the target box do essentially whatever they wanted. We were going to configure it as a linux service on our virtual machines, dev boxes, and wsl instances\n\n\nI spent DAYS writing this before I realized what I did. Luckily I caught myself before it was pushed to the repo and other developers actually started using the dang thing. Maybe it would have been caught in the PR, maybe it wouldnt have, but every WSL instance on every developer's machine could have had the worst possible kind of back door installed on them.\n\n\nI don't know how I didnt catch this earlier. Neither did anyone else that I showed it to and discussed my design with. Like, I'm happy I caught it, but how did I not see it for what it was before I dang near finished the thing? \n\nThe worst part is that I have cybersecurity training. \n\nUgh.\n\nI guess sometimes you don't see the forest for the trees.\n\nI could implement SSL and encrypt it, but even encrypted I hate the idea of an \"Arbitrary Bash Command\" service running on any of our machines, encrypted or not, so I'll probably give up the remote agent component altogether and use an ssh-based solution.",

Most data calls would fall under O(N), O(N\\^2) and so on.\n\nWhen you have a database, how would you identify that a method may fall under O(N\\^2) (or greater) and how would you approach optimizing it?

Tech teams can use the elaborate framework given by IEEE repeatedly with their own unique activities and procedures. The major stages of the software maintenance life cycle are described by this framework as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Problem identification phase: Phase one of the problem-solving process involves identifying the software modification requests and giving each one a unique identification number.\n2. Problem analysis stage: This stage evaluates each legitimate modification request to ascertain its viability and scope.\n3. Design phase: Based on needs provided in earlier phases, developers construct new modules that need to be replaced or modified at this stage.\n4. Implementation phase: During the implementation phase, developers adjust the software as a whole and add specifications, new features, and code.\n5. System test phase: During this stage, the development/testing team tests how well new modules work with the overall system.\n6. Acceptance test phase: During acceptance testing, internal users or a third party specify and run tests on the fully integrated system.\n7. Delivery phase: The group distributes updated software to users following a positive outcome from the acceptance testing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rexebspvaxfa1.png?width=1434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec4f97fe2e59badd97bd662b5d45df4c98580d02",

        "text": "Since ChatGPT, many articles have been popping up about how AI will replace software engineers and developers. (Maybe not in the near future, but eventually)\n\n1) Reasoning, if AI will be able outperform humans in software development, building amazing application useful for other engineering courses like CAD softwares, then what stops it from replacing other engineers like mechanical, aerospace, etc?\n\nAs far as I know if we reach a point that AI is able to automate software engineers, then won’t it as well automate all other engineers? I mean if the AI is smart enough to automate the development of complex applications, then it will also be able to automate the usage of those applications. Maybe it won’t even require to develop those applications and just bridge to output the required engine/design artefacts. It will be able to assemble complex physical process pipelines.\n\n2) What I don’t understand is why will software engineers/computer scientists be replaced before other engineers. Aren’t they necessary to maintain and enhance AI? If we reach an AI able to learn entirely alone this means no other job is safe.\n\nI can’t quite understand why software engineers/computer scientists are the most in danger of losing their jobs. I though computer scientists would be the last jobs to become obsolete if AI excels humans, since they are the brains behind AI advancements.\n\n3) How aren’t careers like lawyers, accountants, physicians, etc more in danger? Those careers can be highly automated as well. Aren’t computer scientists needed to automate them?\n\n4) Also will software engineering/computer science change towards a more AI and interdisciplinary point of view? Or will it remain the same and just become obsolete in the future?\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not talking about the near future.",
