If I found it has any effect whatsoever, it seems a short step from there to someone saying you were implicating one race or people with a certain trait. For example, region of high heat and humidity might have certain customs...*omg are you saying Mexicans are lazy?!*\n\nOr perhaps you were studying outcomes and professions of people by culture. You're might find, objectively, that Eastern European Jews took experience in money lending into their emigration to America, and are still to this day found in Banking and Finance at higher than average rates. But that's a stereotype!\n\nOr in psychology, it's hard to imagine studying *anything* by race or sex or cultural breakdown, and finding any discrepancy that can't be spun to have a certain implication, or upset those who think any implication of non-equality in anything is always wrong.\n\nSo, what effect does this have? Do people avoid certain topics of research because of it? Are certain results ever not published? Do you ever feel pressure to bend or soften the facts because of how people might take it?",

The center of the political discussion in a great many countries around the world seems to be in a similar place.  On a host of issues such as same-sex marriage, taxation, defense spending, labor and business regulation, pornography regulation, etc., many countries seem to have the same policy debates contemporaneously.   Countries as different as Canada, Israel, India, the U.S., France, Mexico, Australia, Chile, Poland, or Greece all seem to be debating in a roughly similar place.   There are some outliers (e.g. the U.S. doesn't have universal health care vs. Scandanavia has a much more robust welfare state).   But in general, although there are many individual *people* in each of these countries who have extreme views on these subjects, there don't seem to be any democracies in which the population as a whole has a view that is wildly out of step with the center of the policy debate in other countries.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at here is that I'm guessing that there might be an \"innate\" tendency for human societies to generate a right-left split in politics that is roughly evenly matched.   Is there any evidence for or against such a proposition? ",

People we all know, MLK, Gandhi, Mandela, Malcom X, Cesar Chavez. Aside from a few differences (especially Malcom X), overall you can see the common method of these leaders: We need remain peaceful and within the law so we don't fuel their hate. This is a great idea, however some leaders took this lesson at different levels. MLK for example was of course Christian influenced, as he himself was a religious leader, so not only did he encourage non-violence and understanding of your enemy (the people who discriminate), but also from teachings in Christianity he taught to forgive and wish the best for them, to not hate but actually even love them.\nThese were and have always been bold ideas. But I wonder, do these extreme methods of peace, to not only fight back but to love, forgive, etc, actually yield positive results when opposing hate? Or are they simply good morals for the self?

In studies following both English- and Spanish-learning toddlers over several years, they found that children who are faster at recognizing familiar words at 18 months have larger vocabularies at age 2 years and score higher on standardized tests of language and cognition in kindergarten and elementary school.",

        "text": "Research has shown that many perceived sex differences in performance and preferences in various fields are strongly influenced by changing culture. For instance, the gap that was researched in the 1990s showed high-performing males outnumbering high-performing females in math performance 12:1. That ratio has now decreased to just 2.8:1. In Iceland male violent crime is at a record low compared to the 80s, and Iceland is considered one of the most equitable nations in terms of gender. Etc, etc. As societies progress towards gender equity, a lot of differences start fading away. This is all detailed in this great post by a group of psychologists compiling meta-analysis to evaluate the veracity of the Google memo, where the find support for James Damore's assertions but question his reductive conclusions.\n\nhttps://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/08/10/the-google-memo-what-does-the-research-say-about-gender-differences/\n\nHowever, this is not universal. This phenomenon can just as easily go the opposite way. In gender equal societies, women and men are more likely to stick to the things they *prefer,* like women preferring \"people\" while men prefer \"things.\" In Scandanvia, for instance, the difference in attitudes towards math between the genders is more pronounced than in conservative countries. Women will also be more agreeable (more \"demure and delicate\" as some would say) in gender equal societies than their counterparts in other locations, etc. This is all detailed, again, in the link above. They summarize it this way:\n\n&gt;But the cross-national findings sometimes show “paradoxical” effects: progress toward gender equality in rights and opportunities sometimes leads to [larger gender differences](https://www.bradley.edu/dotAsset/165918.pdf) in some traits and career choices. \n\nMy question is, why do you think that is? Why does the hard, quantitative data in ability (math, reading, etc) show that gender differences are narrowing in more equal societies, but the \"soft,\" more subjective data regarding personality traits and individual preferences show a *widening* gap in some gender-equal societies?",

        "text": "I bet I'm not the first one to make this somewhat sociological observation but I still want to share this, all the more because what I'm about to say here applies to many online platforms, I think, not just Reddit.\n\nThe first time I seriously looked into what Reddit actually is was a few month ago. My boyfriend who was (and is) an active user tried to explain to me why Reddit is the best approach to taking your daily dose of news: instead of getting tons of biased political BS through regular news websites, you can subscribe to subreddits that you're actually interested in with user -provided links and topics and unlimited discussion space, all of those contributing towards your deeper understanding of what's going on out there. All of which is great, and I have a lot of appreciation for that.\n\nHowever, let's look into the following hypothetical scenario: say, I'm a conspiracy theory junkie (or a feminist, or an atheist, whatever), and I go and subscribe to all the subreddits that reflect my interests. Next, all the links and discussions start pouring into my feed that support my views because they are provided and upvoted by users who are as much into the subject as I am, and I'd be unlikely to be exposed to alternative viewpoints through my subscriptions. \n\nAnd here's my question: would you say this way of doing it provides me with fuller and better information on whatever issue I'm looking into, or does it make more biased by supplying a lot of arguments in support of one side and isolating me from differently oriented sources? \n\nSure, people argue on Reddit and you can be subscribed to multiple subreddits that represent different positions, but I'm talking about the general trend and how it affects society as a whole. Any opinions welcomed.",

        "text": "Hey there. First of all, since this is a very complex topic, I'd like to clarify some aspects about my perspective (wich I can prove, if necessary) so I don't make anyone offended.\n1. English is not my first language. I don't have all the vocabulary to express myself as I'd like to here and there will be some grammar mistakes. Sorry!\n2. I always try to adopt a Marxist analysis, meaning that I side with antifas and I'd love to punch a nazi in the face \n3. I am a Latina woman, which means I am a race mixed person: my father is a black man and my mother a white woman. So no, I'm not one of those white supremacists despicable ppl.\n\nWell, this question was brought from a discussion with Marxist feminists about abortion practices vs eugenics. We were discussing this article https://www.cbsnews.com/news/down-syndrome-iceland/ and the ethics involved in using abortion to reduce genetic conditions that are considered problematic.\nAs we all agreed that, in a context of disparity and capitalism, the decision of having an abortion should be made by the mother only - independently of the case, we focused on discussing about reasons a woman would have to make this choice in an ideal situation, where there would be real support from the state for a shared childcare.  In this case, what are the ethics implications of aborting a fetus only for having (idk how to say this in English) a \"genetic deficiency\"? And is this a eugenic thought? \nAt this point, I made my mind that I would still not bare a child with an severe intellectual illness because I wouldn't want it to suffer and I wouldn't want to suffer myself. I have close relatives with severe down syndrome in their 30s that have to be bathed by their parents. They don't talk, barely communicate, and they had been like this all their lifes. Of course I take care of them and love them and I would like people to not discriminate them. But knowing what I know about the difficulties of existence, I wouldn't bring a person who will be forever intellectual ill to this world, even though I want to have children one day. And then I thought that was an eugenic thing to say.\n\nLately I found some articles, in Portuguese, that distinguished eugenics from racial hygiene. Eugenics being a scientific way of reducing human illnesses and genetic problems, like genetic engineer, and hygienism being  supremacist bullshit stuff.  Now I'm even more confused, and I'd like to know what you guys think of this situation. Is erradicating down syndrome a eugenic thing to do?  Isn't it a kind of illness, afterall? In an ideal perspective, from any kind of view, isn't it preferable that people are always born (intellectual*) healthy?\n",

In China, I'm always told to never trust strangers (including cashiers, chefs, doctors, etc), since they'll try to take advantage of you. People seem slightly less considerate of others, e.g. cutting in line or not giving up bus seats to the elderly. Robbery and scams are also more common. For example, when I went shopping for a phone, I was told that most of the phones sold were bootleg. We had to contact a family friend to sell us a legitimate phone. If he didn't know us, he would've sold us a bootleg phone too.\n\nIs there a cultural reason for this? Obviously, relative income is lower in China, so more people have to resort to scamming others in order to maintain a decent quality of life. However, it seems weird that a Communist country, which should value working together, has a population that antagonizes each other so much.",

Some people even go as far as saying that suppression of ideas is not effective.\n\nI'm deliberately ignoring here the position that claims that free speech is a fundamental right that must not be breached under any circumstances. I also don't care about whether the Nazis hold any significant political power or are likely to do so in the future.\n\nGiven this context, I have a question:\n\n*Empirically, how effective is the suppression of free speech regarding silencing certain ideas, and how sustainable is that?*\n\nThe Soviet Union, for example, lasted for a long time while silencing any opposition to the State. Suppressing dissenting opinions seems to have played a crucial role in keeping it stable for as long as it did.\n\nSeveral branches of Christianity seem to have thrived by suppressing alternative ideas.\n\nI could probably dig up a large number of examples or counter-examples.\n\nOf course if you're willing to perform genocide on your enemies you can silence them just fine. I'm interested in situations where you're only willing to imprison, kill or otherwise punish individuals or small groups of like-minded individuals in order to silence them.\n\nI'm aware it's hard to attribute the fact that ideas don't spread merely to the fact that you're suppressing free speech, but I'm interested in what history has to teach us about it.",

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone had any knowledge of a review that compares and contrasts these.\n\n\nThanks!",

I also see it on Twitter but don't really pay attention to them. In short, with the social data on a person (gender, lifestyle, buying habits, pixel tracking) I'm thinking advertisements are better targeted and in some way increase sales and spending.\n\nBesides direct targets, there's also a lot of word of mouth spreading and social media has made it faster and easier to share whatever and whatnot. I'm also guessing there's a lot more spending on social influencers who guide people to buy something.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Assuming spending is increasing, is it possible to say social media is helping small business growth more than before?\n\n1. Conversely, can social media activity be linked to the downfall of growth in some industries or even corporations?\n\n1. In regards to paid sponsors and social influencers, is there a way to track if consumer trust has been affected by this?\n\n1. If I could find a correlation between social media activity per person and GDP growth, how would I prove that's casual and not merely a correlation?",

As such, these must count as major events not only in the written history of the Jewish people, but as major events to the Judaic Faith. We have the tale of the Exodus of the Jewish people, and now we seem to have a current, as-of-this-moment-being-written, history of the Holocaust, the development and growth of Israel as a Jewish state, as well as a large proportion of the global Jewish population making aliyah (mass immigration of Jews to Israel.)\n\nHow exactly is Judaism reacting to this? Are there special commities created to write down a Jewish 'high-council' approved document of the Holocaust? Of the creation of Israel? Of the Jewish population making Aliyah?\n\nOr is this a far more complicated issue? Are different factions in the Faith approving different documents? Are there documents being created at all?",
