        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWnWZe2KzGA\n\nHere we have a nice pop history channel looking to compare the Roman and British empires based on expansion, value and legacy. Honestly I'm not well versed in the history of the British Empire but I do know my Roman history so I'll mainly be focusing there.\n\n00:47 *\"In 509 BC, it became a Republic and its biggest foe was the dominant power of Carthage\"*\n\nRight off the bat we've got some bad history. Here it is implying that right as Rome became free and a republic it became the arch-nemesis of Carthage. This, however, wasn't immediately the case. In fact Carthage was a big supporter of Rome in its infancy against the Etruscans. They offered Rome aid against the Samnites too and continued to be nominal allies right through to Pyrrhus' campaign in Sicily in 278 BCE. Their hostility only really started to arise shortly after in the coming decade. All in all Carthage and Rome were allies for longer than they were enemies,\n\n00:57 *\"...and it was formally recognised as an empire after the adopted son of Julius Caesar, Gaius Octavius, took power over the free Roman Republic\"*\n\nThis quite the generalisation, understandable for something trying to work as an infographic. But Rome didn't \"formally\" recognise itself as a monarchy when Augustus initiated the first settlement in 27 BCE (assuming that they mean that when they say Empire). Since Rome was a monarchy in the 9th to 6th centuries BCE Roman culture had a strict hatred for its people to be ruled by a monarch, and this was the case right through to Augustus' time. The idea of a Rex (King) was seen as the worst fate, ultimately leading to the death of Julius Caesar by the \"Liberators\". The stigma behind even suggesting that one might attempt such a thing could be career ending, or worse life ending (as seen with the Gracchi). In fact Augustus wanted to remove himself far from that image in a number of ways, such as referring to himself as the Princep (the leading man) of Rome, a term used to refer to the most important people in Roman politics (previously being Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, Cato, etc. the generation before) but now just one person. Also he adamantly refused to accept the title of Dictator even in the dire state of plague and famine in 23 BCE, since he feared the public's fear and hatred of a king.\n\nThe time in which Rome could have been seen to \"formally\" declare itself a monarchy is after the time of Caligula's assassination in 41 CE where there was a serious thought by the senate to restore the republican tradition. Up until the Praetorians came and declared Claudius the ruler of Rome. Here we could say is the point of no return for when Rome became a proper monarchy, some 68 years later than the video claimed.\n\nAlso Augustus was not the only one to have \"took power over the free Roman Republic\". That had been done by both the Populares and the Optimates with Sulla, Marius and Caesar.\n\n1:20 Small thing here but it shows chariots among the military arsenal of Rome. Chariots weren't used by the Republic nor the Empire and were seen only in arena races.\n\n1:33 *\"...parts of what was known as Great Britain were now ruled over by the Roman Empire after the first Roman invasion of the Britons by Julius Caesar in 55 and 54 BC\"*\n\nHere they're saying that Rome took Britain gradually after Julius Caesar's conquests in 55 and 54. However the implication is wrong. Caesar's two campaigns amounted in failure and failed to materialise any presence on the island. The most it amounted to was gloria for Caesar in the sense that he ventured into the most unknown territory, so much so that there was debate among his political enemies as to whether the island even existed or was a propaganda ploy by Caesar.\n\nThe Roman conquests of Britain only really took off during the reign of Claudius and his first campaign in 43 CE. They would proceed to conquer modern Wales and further north into modern day Scotland. They would reach a peak at the Antoine Wall by the Firth of Forth in the mid 2nd century CE but settle at the Hadrian Wall near the modern ~~Brit~~English/Scottish border.\n\n1:55 This isn't the roman stuff but this map of the peak of the British Empire, however it missed a bunch of areas. For example it misses: Egypt, Sudan, The horn of Africa, Afghanistan and Burma. Plus for some reason it adds these two islands off the east coast of Australia.\n\n2:24 *\"Julius Caesar lead conquests into the Iberian Peninsula, what we now think of as parts of Andora, Portugal and Spain.\"*\n\nThis here is implying that Julius Caesar had conquered the Iberian peninsula or a large swath of it, however this isn't true. Rome had acquired its first holdings in Iberia after seizing the colonies of Carthage after their victory against them in the Second Punic War. These were parts of the southern and eastern coasts. From here Rome expanded west into Iberia over the next century, particularly in the Celtiberian Wars and Numantine War. The Iberian Peninsula was only finally subdued in the times of Augustus in the Cantabrian Wars (29 - 19 BCE), more than 2 decades after Julius Caesar was assassinated. \n\nHowever Julius Caesar did campaign in Hispania, but only as a Praetor in 62 BCE in Southern Hispania. There he conquered two small tribes to squash a rebellion (which were frequent in the province) but certainly did not subdue the whole Peninsula. The only other time he would return is shortly after his march on Rome in 49 BCE he marched into Iberia against some of the legions Pompey had stationed there.\n\n2:35 *\"Caesar didn't stop there! Launching assaults against the Parthian Empire...\"*\n\nI'm guessing they're still talking about Julius Caesar since they hadn't differentiated if they meant Augustus. So then they're mistaken again as Caesar **would** have gone on his expedition against Parthia if not for contracting 23 stab wounds days before he was to leave.\n\n4:53 Here we see that you trust no one, not even yourself dual wielding two gladii...\n\n5:02 *\"If you were unlucky enough to be put in the Colosseum gladiatorial ring, you might die even quicker...\"*\n\nAlthough prisoners, enemies of the state and slaves would often meet their demise in the arena, if you were an actual gladiator your chance of dying was significantly lower. Many of the professional gladiators lived rather well and are noted to have fought numerous battles, retire and live to an old ripe age. Its important to keep in mind that they were a trained and disciplined in the ways of fighting, and most importantly had huge personalities and loyal fans. To kill one was to lose a lot of money and in the later Empire was fine-able. Also the loyalty of their people to them isn't to be underestimated as was seen when Caligula issued 5 popular but defeated gladiators to death, which caused a huge uproar and riot by the spectators. \n\nIn reality proper Gladiator fights were more akin to a WWE match. A few clashes here and there, throwing around the place, maybe a cut or two and you've got the crowd riled up. Victory wasn't just assured by the death of an opponent but could be from \"tap-out\" or even happen if no blood is drawn but one is put in a losing position. They were also refereed, they could call it off, declare a move illegal or even time them out to get wounds treated or to have a back-rub. \n\nThe death rate of the gladiator was between 1/4 to 1/5, which is including professionals and non-professionals. They would usually fight 3 matches a year and usually only about 10 until they ended their career. The fatality rate could also probably be due to the sheer amount of arenas across the Empire with estimates of upwards of 400 arenas. \n\n5:22 *\"...they had a holiday in which master switched places with their slaves, or at least let slaves criticise them.\"*\n\n**IO SATURNALIA!** *ahem* Yes during Saturnalia the lines between Master and Slave were slightly blurred but the distinction was very much still there. Its better to think of it as them treating the slaves like they were more valuable/important slaves (i.e: Butlers) than the degenerates their masters would have thought them of as. Slaves couldn't properly critique or complain either (\"Why did you send me to the Latifundia?\") but maybe be loose with their words when playing dice games or when drunk without the whippings and beatings that would normally follow. They could however sit and eat with their masters, but were still of course obligated to a number of their jobs like serving and preparing food and the like.\n\n6:30 Actually these are good reasons, good job video!\n\n7:20 *sigh* And now you've done it with the good ol' Dark Ages spiel!\n\nWell that's all folks. Its a nicely designed video, I can give them that, but the research seemed to be rather iffy. If anyone else noted any faults with the British side of the history it would be great to hear. Also I have to note that the video didn't seem to actually go into any comparison, it just sorted of stated what each one did in their time and that they collapsed.

        "text": "[The Image that is the centre of discussion](http://i.imgur.com/VGWfo0p.jpg)\n\nBecause of a drought of content on badhistory recently, I have been looking through old posts to get my critical hardon on, so to speak. Just shy of a year ago /u/hborrgg/ discussed the image above, which shows the advancement of the European Knight throughout the centuries. He only discussed the odd choice to show a 17th century musketeer - a choice that I also disagree with since reiters or lancers would likely be a better representation of a western \"knight\" in 17th century. [You can find the thread right over here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5dl2c1/evolution_of_the_european_knight/)\n\nBut since that thread already discussed the 17th century, I instead want to look at the areas I'm more familiar with, specifically the mid-13th to mid-15th and early 16th centuries. It's also been noted that this image was used in children's book, and to that I say that this does not excuse badhistory. I'll be using mostly effigies and iconographies to show a point. They're not *necessarily* the most accurate representations of contemporary armours, but they're often the best we've got. \n\n\n**1100**\n\nThis one doesn't appear to be too bad. This isn't my area of expertise in the slightest though, so don't quote me here, but as far as I know we have no evidence of using gambesons (padded armours) in this era. This does not mean that gambesons were not used. We simply don't know, though historians seem to agree that it's fairly likely. No real badhistory there that I can find, just a small tidbit of information.\n\n\n**1250**\n\nOverall this knight isn't too bad. My biggest problem is with the great helm. I can find no examples of great helms from this period that look like this, and this shape appears to be much more modern. Great helms of this period were more likely to look like actual buckets, with much less shaping done to the front. Examples in effigies: [here,](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/1262/2853/) [here,](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/3367/2803/) [and this bad boy](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/1551/1556/). The Maciejowski Bible was also written in this period and shows no helmets of this sort. Rather, most of them are very similar to [what the effigies show](http://www.keesn.nl/mac/macpics/mac10vA.jpg)\n\n\n**1330**\n\nAnd we move on to 1330, where more decent history is mixed in with more badhistory. The coat of plates appears to be Wisby style, which historians agree would be accurate for this period, since we assume that the weapons and armour used by the defeated side at the battle of Wisby were outdated due to the lower status of the soldiers. I should just briefly mention that I personally don't believe leather was used very often for coats of plates, because it's a terrible material for armour and wool is much easier to look after - an important trait for battle harnesses. I believe the overuse of leather in modern reenactment to be mostly an inaccuracy. But that's my personal educated guess, and nothing more.\n\nI'm not entirely sure that this shape of sword is accurate for the period. While I looked around for swords of this era, it's hard to tell whether something this pointy would be used. Oakeshott types XIII and XIV would probably be accurate for this period, and neither are quite this slender, so I think I'll have to mark it down as badhistory. \n\nThe use of leather for greaves, the armour that protects the shins, is also peculiar. [There are extant examples of leather armour for the arms. Leather WAS used a bit, though not as much as some people think.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/75/0a/29/750a29a578ff2953b546f09acd356c5e.jpg) [Another example](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2f/9f/3d/2f9f3d78eb90b96798ecb938d831dd8a.jpg). However, I can find no examples of extant leather greaves, and this just seems like a bizarre choice all around.\n\nThe gauntlets were supposed to be [Wisby style, I believe](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b9/8b/42/b98b4219471d974599d57126e05f9edc--th-century-grave.jpg), though the lanes are outside, while most reconstructions I've seen, including the one that the museum itself shows, has the wrist segments on the inside of the leather, as you'd expect from a coat of plates.\n\nThe bascinet shown (the skullcap in the top right corner. From my understanding we call this one an early bascinet because it's pointed, and will develop into the bascinet proper that we know and love) seems a little anachronistic too. The Facebook page *XIV Century Armour* has an excellent pdf file containing ALL extant 14th century armours that we know of, and all of the bascinets/skullcaps with noseguards come a few decades after 1330. This is supported by the effigies, [which sometimes show some very interesting visors](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/992/2421/), [here too](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/1423/19887/), but not nasal guards. Of course, such a guard would obscure the face of the wearer, which is a big no-no for many effigies, but we have examples of actual bascinets and nasal guards, and many of them come from later.\n\nEDIT: This does not meant to say that these sorts of bascinets couldn't have existed. I just know of no examples from THIS early.\n\n\n**1400**\n\nOne of the most heavily reenacted time periods, because it bridges the gap between relatively simple armour that looks cool and the very complicated armours that came just a few decades later. The start of 14th century is just before the Battles of Agincourt and Grunwald too, and God knows people love those two. So it's unsurprising that, alongside the many masterpieces, there is also a lot of crap. This drawing leans a tiny bit more to the crap side. \n\nAt this point in history, a shield would be pretty much redundant for most men-at-arms. Plate armour does the job more than well enough, ~~and since this particular man-at-arms has a polearm, he wouldn't even be able to use a shield effectively.~~ *As /u/psychocanuck correctly pointed out, he has a warhammer and I'm a stupid idiot. Excuse me.*\n\nThe breastplate is outdated too. [It's in an odd Churburg style,](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/568086940467893492/) but Churburg is dated to 1380s. There is no actual consensus on the age of this breastplate, and some dates appear to be as late as 1420s, though I'm pretty skeptical. In either case these sorts of armours were not the norm, [as effigies are wont to show](http://effigiesandbrasses.com/search/?year=1395&amp;year_end=1405&amp;tags=&amp;institution=&amp;name=&amp;costumes=1&amp;genders=M). The thing is that, even *if* this breastplate is accurate for the start of 15th century, if you're going to show the advancement of a man-at-arms, you should probably show the normal. That's bearing in mind that most dating estimates 1380s-1390s.\n\nOther than that, not too much to say about this armour. Appears to be Italian in style, judging by the vambraces. English-style vambraces tended to be different, more protective, since the English preferred fighting on foot.\n\n\n**1450**\n\nWe get onto probably my favourite family of armours; the Milanese plate armour. These things are absolutely gorgeous, with asymmetrical pauldrons offering a ton of protection for the left side, where most blows would come from, and leaving the right side slightly more exposed to allow the man-at-arms to couch their lance with ease. The armour itself doesn't have too many issues, though I have absolutely no idea what's going on with the gorget.\n\nThe sallet at the top left is odd though. The bevor plate - which protects the chin and throat - seems to wrap around the neck. [There are examples of lanes being on the chin as opposed to throat/collarbone](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/60/6d/01/606d0162a746abd6a0306fbb51c3cc53.jpg) but the gorget in general is just shaped weirdly. Also this appears to represent a French-style sallet alongside an Italian harness. Not necessarily incorrect, since armours were mismatched, just weird.\n\n\n**1525**\n\nThe transition from an Italian armour to a German armour is strange to me. This is a Maximilian set of armour, but this form of armour developed from earlier Gothic-style plate armour, and NOT Milanese plate armour. It just strikes me as odd that they chose to do it this way. If you're going to talk about the evolution of armour, it's probably best to focus on a region, because the entirety of Europe varied greatly. Exports, of course, were very popular, but you should still focus on individual regions as opposed to the entirety of Europe.\n\nI don't really know enough about the Maximilian plate armour. The placement of the Zweihander to the right of the 15th century man-at-arms is peculiar, since this weapon was indeed used in 1525, but not in 1450. I assume it's the lack of space. I'm also not entirely sure that someone wearing a full set of Gothic armour would employ a zweihander, a weapon most commonly associated with mercenary bands. Again, this area isn't my forte so I won't comment any further, and if you happen to know more about early 16th century I'll be happy to hear your thoughts.\n\n\nOverall, not too bad. I'm mostly nitpicking, but I was told that if I want to be anal about small details this is the subreddit for me. So here I am.\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "Welcome back to Part 2 of Hallmark's miniseries on the life and times of Cleopatra. If you watched part 1, why are you here? You should already know better than to willingly sit through this. If you missed it here [it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6sge8w/hallmarks_cleopatra_1998_50_shades_of_pedantry/).\n\nWith that settled, time to dive back into the contrived melodrama surrounding Cleopatra's stay in Rome, which I think was largely inspired by Suetonius' account. In other words, *Like the sands of Egypt slip through the hourglass, these are the days of our lives of the 12 Caesars.*\n\n1:12:43 Cleopatra responds to Caesar's insistence that Octavius is his son by saying \"Octavius is not your flesh and blood.\" But...he was, he was his grand-nephew and also it was not known that Octavian would be his heir yet so if she is so out of the loop that she has no idea who his close relatives are, how does she know that Octavius will be adopted?\n\n1:13:04 Caesar says \"Egypt is only free because I wish it so.\" but it is really doubtful that he could have attempted to conquer the country in the midst of the civil war and afterwards he would need to not only come up with an excuse to annex Egypt (something that far-sighted Romans had been conquer-blocking for decades) but also pour troops and resources into *that* war and not invading Parthia. Even his intended conquest of Parthia was controversial and contributed to his impending doom, so the best time for him to have conquered Egypt would be immediately after defeating Ptolemy and Arsinoe but even then I doubt it would have gone smoothly because Octavian's dramatic and crushing defeat of Cleopatra was followed by revolt and insurrection in Egypt (and plenty of drama with Egypt's governors). I mean technically I think Rome *could* conquer Egypt at this time but that line of thought takes us too far into alt-history to make reliable assumptions. That said, maintaining 2 legions in Egypt did guarantee Caesar a great deal of personal influence over the country and the crown in addition to Rome's obvious innate advantage.\n\n1:13:54 Julius Caesar sends Marc Antony to protect Cleopatra and Caesarion, which does not sound *that* unreasonable until you consider the context and realise he basically said \"*Let me send my recently disgraced co-consul to babysit, having recently tried to turn his unpopular behaviour around and rein in his alcoholism he will be perfect for the job of single-handedly protecting them from...something. Whatever I am afraid of happening to them in my own villa this night of all possible nights for something to happen.*\"\n\n1:14:14 Octavius was almost certainly not aware that he was Caesar's heir, no one just automatically assumed that a relatively unknown teenager was going to be given the keys to the kingdom, and having Octavius actively scheming against Cleopatra at this point is just going overboard to establish a rivalry between them that did not exist. Not to mention vilifying him by having him *literally plot to murder a baby so his inheritance is more secure*. Now I think it is probably clear to everyone who is familiar with me that I think Actium was an inside job and a Neo-Hellenistic era was/is imminent but why is Octavius always basically the devil in these adaptations, why not just let him and Cleopatra both be morally ambiguous, ambitious autocrats instead of making everything meh vs evil? I will not bring this up again no matter how many times it comes up in the film because I *know* this is just a major plot point and we have to deal with it.\n\nBut that brings us to another issue, in every adaptation the birth of Caesarion and Cleopatra's visit to Rome with him stirs up massive controversy and is a crux for a lot of the drama. But the problem is that Caesarion is only brought up by contemporary sources *after* Caesar's death despite other mentions of his mother's activities prior to that. This makes it seem that his presence and perhaps even his existence was fairly obscure until his mother began to make claims over his paternity. It most certainly indicates a lack of widespread controversy because none of it is reported either by Cicero or later historians, and even when Suetonius reports gossip over him in the wake of Caesar's assassination it is primarily centred around people who were close to Caesar and had a stake in Caesarion's status one way or another, meaning that this does not help us ascertain much of anything prior to that. \n\n\n1:15:06 First of Antony is still wearing guyliner and I have no idea why, secondly why is he perpetually wearing full armour? *No one* in the history of ever wore full armour in all their waking hours and soldiers were actually not allowed to be fully armed and armoured within Rome just because they liked it. I just realised that there has not been a single scene without him wearing full armour no matter how inappropriate. And you know it just seems uncomfortable, Roman kit was heavy and full of mostly necessary equipment but why would anyone go around covered in heavy metal of the non-genre kind just to look cool?\n\n1:15:15 There is no reason to think that Antony and Cleopatra were friends or even close before meeting in Tarsus, in fact the circumstances surrounding their meeting kind of imply that they were not. So all of this alcoholic bonding is anachronistic and forced.\n\n1:16:20 Marc Antony never thwarted an assassination attempt aimed at Caesarion in Rome by singlehandedly butchering the assassins.\n\n1:16:52 Antony just did a springboard jump across the room to pounce on and waterboard/interrogate an assassin in a fountain. He has the brutality of the Punisher and the agility of Spider-Man, but the drinking ability of Rick Sanchez? No wonder Caesar left him in charge. I should not even be complaining, the sight of him flying across the dark room and knocking that guy off his feet was hilarious.\n\n1:17:53 Julius Caesar never demanded to be hailed as a demigod by the Senate, nor was he officially made a divinity until after his death.\n\n1:19:09 Caesar and Cleopatra have an exchange wherein it is made clear that he intends to become a king and feels he should be considered divine which Cleopatra fully supports, but historically there is also no reason to think he wanted to be considered a literal, living god.  Whether he had kingly aspirations is debatable but if the stunt at Lupercalia was planned it still proved that he could not pull it off at that time. At best we can say that he associated himself with the divine most prominently through his relationship to Venus, his ancestress and patron.\n\n1:20:25 See I thought I was being overly critical of inaccurate political statements and implications in this extended bath scene but clearly I underestimated this scene. Not only has an inaccurate falling out between Caesar and Cleopatra occurred but Caesar just literally told Cleopatra that she was in fact not free to leave Rome, or him. Neither of those things have any basis in any surviving literary and are really messed up.\n\nI mean, this scene has Julius Caesar plotting his own ascension to kingship and godhood, telling Cleopatra that she does not really have the option of leaving if she cares about Egypt, shrugging off Octavian's attempted assassination of Caesarion and then leaving her when she gets upset about it. Why are the Julii such douchebags in this adaptation? They just literally made up a scene revolving around things that did not happen. At this point it is more interesting to point out which bits are semi-accurate than pointing out bad history.\n\n1:21:21 Cleopatra asks \"Why should I believe a word you say? That you'll free my land? Or marry me? Or be a true father?\" But free Egypt from what? The treaty proclaiming it to be a friend and ally of the Republic? Rome *was* more powerful than Egypt but that was because it had steadily grown as a military and trading power over the last century while Egypt declined and was now no longer a force to be reckoned with although the country as a whole was still lavishly wealthy.\n\n Although it is true that many Roman politicians took advantage of the situation there was no decree or agreement that could undo Roman influence over Egypt at this point, it was intertwined in the political and economic network between the two countries. Even if Caesar waved a wand to undo all of the previous debts and precedents permitting Roman interventions in Egypt, the Ptolemaic dynasty would still feel a practical need to be on friendly terms with their neighbouring superpower, this was the case following the conquest of Macedonia and it was *certainly* the case in the 1st Century BCE. \n\nThe other two things were also probably off the table but I do not have as much information there so I am less confident in any extrapolations. In any case we do not have any solid reasons to think Caesar promised either of those things, and with the exception of rumors and speculation we have every reason *not* to believe that.\n\n1:22:30 Well I mean I already mentioned that there is no reason to think there was not any such falling out between Caesar and Cleopatra but I am going to point it out again because there is no reason to think this precipitated Cleopatra not supporting the Parthian campaign. Technically it is possible but only in the sense that anything not explicitly contradicted is possible.\n\n1:23:23 Oh greaat, rather than actually exploring the regicidal motives of the conspirators the writers went with a copy-pasted version of the propaganda against Marc Antony. \"*He is ruled by weakness and indecent pleasure.*\" it even sounds copy pasted from literature against Antony. Also as *if* Octavius was involved with the conspirators when he had no motive, nothing to contribute, no strong affiliation with its members, and was not in Rome when Caesar was assassinated but anything to make sure the audience knows who the bad guy is.\n\nAlso why are they conspiring in the Temple of Venus Genitrix exactly? Not very inconspicuous is it, especially when they could just go to someone's house and conspire like normal traitors.\n\n1:24:05 Oh, I see. They just literally took the theory that Marc Antony knew about the assassination and let it happen because he wanted to inherit and replaced \"Antony\" with \"Octavius\". That is a falsehood built on inaccuracy that rips off a theory making it technically 2.5X normal bad history.\n\n1:25:38 Marcus Junius was not the one that stabbed Caesar last, nor was he in all likelihood who Caesar addressed if he said anything to the effect of \"Kai su teknon\", it was Decimus Brutus who has basically been absorbed by his more famous brother at this point.\n\n1:26:17 Antony did not immediately run to the aid of Caesar because he ran away,  and iirc Caesar was just lying there for a couple of hours.\n\n1:28:59 First of all, Caesar's funeral did not go to plan, supposedly after Antony gave his speech in the Rostrum the crowd made an impromptu pyre for him right there, but he was originally going to the Campus Martius and secondly Cleopatra was not present at this event because foreign monarchs were not permitted to cross the pomerium and it seems really unlikely that anyone would have made an exception in this case, especially since she is not mentioned as having been been present. On the bright side Antony is no longer wearing armour because although that is perfectly appropriate for a casual party, do not even *consider* wearing that to a funeral.\n\n1:30:10 This film jumpcuts from Antony swearing to avenge Julius Caesar to the Liberators' Civil War, and implies that Antony went directly to fighting Caesar's assassins while glossing over the fact that he ensured they were not punished for the murder and first came into open conflict after Antony's term as consul ended and he was appointed to the province of Macedonia which was not a favourable position for him. Prior to this he was not trying to destroy the Liberators or openly alienate the Senate in any way because he was keeping hid options open. \n\n1:30:20 Apparently cavalry charges down the side of a steep valley into a riverbed are impossible to detect until the horses were a few meters from you.\n\n1:30:45 Cassius was not captured by Marc Antony and forced to commit suicide, he killed himself after receiving reports of Brutus' defeat and subsequent suicide. Also he died at the first Battle of Philippi which was not fought between the straggling march of Cassius' troops down a river while Antony rushes down. It is true that Antony outmanoeuvred him but the two forces still met in formation not by everyone running around and Cassius' forces getting slaughtered. With the exception of Cassius killing himself, Antony did not actually accomplish a clear victory and certainly not the crushing final defeat of Liberators' forces that is portrayed here.\n\n1:32:40 Octavius never had Casca assassinated in the baths, in all likelihood he died in the Battle of Philippi. That said, I am completely assuming that the disjointed battle sequences I just saw were the Battle of Philippi at all, because the movie is not interested in explaining or contextualising any of it.\n\n1:34:19 Brutus' body was not mutilated on the orders of Octavian because Octavian never ordered such a thing and Antony ensured his corpse was treated with respect. Also Antony chastising Octavian for desecrating the body of his enemy is actually really ironic given that he had Cicero's head and hands lopped off and nailed up inside the Forum irl.\n\n1:34:30 Antony screams at Octavian that he is a butcher but this is historically like the pot calling the kettle black. The Second Triumvirate brought back proscriptions and as I mentioned above Antony carried them out with zeal, the Roman civil wars saw a lot of butchery but Antony's hands were no cleaner than Octavian's by a longshot.\n\n1:34:46 Cleopatra is sure that Octavian will invade Egypt, but historically there was no reason for her to assume this and she did not. Cassius had threatened to invade Egypt previously but it made no sense for the Second Triumvirate to at this point, and in any case it was Antony who accused her of supporting the Liberators'. Also why she is wearing a beaded necklace and what is up with that crown? Did the costume designer decide diadems were too boring and decided that making it a multicoloured modern art serpent was the way to go? Because that has been bothering me every time I see it.\n\n1:35:00 What an interesting assortment of characters advising Cleopatra. First of all Rufio is not mentioned following his appointment as commander of the legions left in Egypt by Caesar and the legions left by Caesar in Egypt did not remain in Egypt because they were killed, captured, or mutinied during the Liberators' war. Exactly what happened to Rufio is not known but he was definitely not still working for Cleopatra years later. All of the other characters are Egyptian, not Macedonian or even Greek which is inaccurate even though the court of Cleopatra was fairly diverse.\n\n1:36:41 Mother. Of. GOD. Every time I see a nemes head-dress on an official I am going to *scream*. Those Nubian guards are *still* wearing nothing but black kilts and headdresses by the way in addition to copious amounts of oil. \n\n1:36:46 \"Unsinkable ship\" meant you were going to die all the way back in 44 BCE.\n\n1:37:05 That ship's captain looks and sounds like the Medjai from the Mummy? [One wikipedia search later] It IS the Medjai guy from the Mummy in this, he just did inaccurate Egyptian historical drama after drama eh?\n\n1:37:50 Apollodorus says the construction of the fleet will bankrupt Egypt but this does not pan out. Although we know that Cleopatra debased the currency, this was in all likelihood more to do with the impact of famines on the economy and the construction of naval vessels was only one part of the crown's military expenses after Caesar's death, the maintenance of huge mercenary contingents, and the support and equipment of Antony's questionably successful campaigns in Parthia and Armenia (which included levies of troops) was by and large the biggest expenditure. Not to mention that she was not said to be in dire financial straits until they began to lose the Final War of the Roman Republic. Beyond this there is absolutely no reason to think that Cleopatra was planning to go to war with Rome at this early stage because of Octavius trying to assassinate Caesarion (which never happened), not only would that be basically lunacy from a practical standpoint but the only literary sources which indicate this are all extremely hostile accounts which insinuate that she planned to destroy Rome all along, even from when she was planning her return from exile, which is...also lunacy.\n\nAnd afterwards she asks Apollodorus about Marc Antony, as if she already *knows* that he will be the key to her efforts against Octavian if she can only turn them against each other, to which Apollodorus states that they are unlikely allies. While that may be correct it is the understatement of the 1st Century, because Octavian and Antony were rivals from the moment Caesar's will was read and they were at each others throats regardless of Cleopatra, not to mention that Antony first sought out Cleopatra as an ally under pretense of charging her with supporting Cassius so even if we assume that Cleopatra was intending to manipulate Antony all along we still can not chalk this whole debacle up to her questionably existent master plan because every other player was taking what amounted to the most apparently expedient course of action to them.\n\n1:37:48 Unlike in this scene, Cleopatra most certainly did *not* go to Antony at once, apparently when he requested her to come to Tarsus she said \"Right away! After I procrastinate a few months...\"\n\n1:40:36 Ok...you know Marc Antony is the definition of a noble, naive idiot in this series and it is *really* getting on my nerves. From making him a selflessly devoted servant of Caesar who rushed to his aid when he got knifed to death, to arguing for more humane treatment of enemies with Octavian, to receiving a surprise visit from Cleopatra who turned up to manipulate him out of the blue with no invite, they just go overboard with it. \n\nBut what brought this mini-rant on was having Cleopatra's visit be a surprise and not the result of him sending Quintus Dellius to her with what amounts to an ultimatum. \n\n1:43:18 The alliance between Antony and Cleopatra was to support a venture against Parthia, not to betray Octavian.\n\n1:47:00 Antony was not a subordinate of Octavian, technically they ruled together and Antony definitely pursued his own interests while governing the East so this series needs to stop pushing him as a \"simple soldier\". Yeah...nothing more down to earth and disciplined than Neos Dionysios, the Lord of Asia.\n\n1:47:30 Cleopatra did not leave Tarsus after one night as she and Antony spent the winter together before Antony embarked on his Parthian campaign. But this scene just glosses over the fact that Antony even planned a Parthian campaign in the first place, as well as ignoring the existence of any of their children but especially the twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene who were conceived and born in Tarsus.\n\n1:47:46 Antony tells Octavian that Caesar is a title that has to be earned, completely misunderstanding how adoption works. That or the writers were confused by the difference between the name and the title. \n\n1:48:30 I can understand that Lepidus is completely excluded from this scene in which the provinces are divided between Octavian and Antony, no one cares about Lepidus and his existence is basically to make the Triumvirate into a tripod, the most unstable of structures. But they argue over who gets Egypt which makes no sense, although there were the Eastern provinces and the province of Africa, Egypt was an independent state and not a part of either. This is a *huge* oversight that screenwriters seem to make consistently and it drives me nuts.\n\n1:48:45 No, Octavian did not get just Spain, Gaul and Africa, the seat of his power was in *Italy* and Lepidus (the hoax \"triumvirate\") got Africa.\n\n1:49:40 Octavian did not suggest that Antony marry Octavia, an unnamed general did.Also this film completely ignores the existence of Antony's wife Fulvia and the war she and Lucius Antonius waged against Octavian which precipitated the need for Octavian and Antony to forge a stronger alliance. This movie skips over all that, pretends the hostilities between the two only exist because Octavian is amoral and weak while portraying Antony as being otherwise willing to serve him which is about as far from the truth as possible, and goes straight to Antony's marriage to Octavia.\n\n1:52:00 Camels were not widely used in the Classical period, horses, mules and donkeys might be present in Cleopatra's retinue but not camels.\n\n1:53:50 Isis was not the daughter of Amun-Re in Egyptian mythology, she was the daughter of Geb who represented earth. Not to mention that in the Ptolemaic cosmology Cleopatra's father would be considered as Dionysius-Osiris, or Serapis before Geb.\n\n1:55:05 Antony did not visit Alexandria until 34 BCE but this has to be anywhere between 39-37 BCE because Antony has already married Octavia but not yet reconciled with Cleopatra. \n\n1:56:58 Caesarion looks to be about 6 here which is in line with the movie's timeline but in real life he would have been around 10. Also those attendants look Nubian or Aethiopian but are wearing the white headbands that denoted relatives of the Ptolemies? Seems legit. As legit as the gellabaiya and turbans the Egyptians wear in this film.\n\n1:57:32 I have no idea where to begin taking apart the bad history in this scene. Its premise revolves around the idea that Antony became the direct overlord of Egypt and that Cleopatra has successfully estranged him from Octavian whereas before he was serving him loyally, and it omits Antony's Parthian and Armenian campaigns entirely. So none of this should be happening the way it is on the political level. On a personal level, Antony should have been previously married with three children and currently be married to Octavia with whom he has two children, while he and Cleopatra also have two children. The enmity between Cleopatra and Octavian was also not derived from Octavian's repeated attempts to assassinate Caesarion, because he made no such attempts at this time and their rivalry developed over time as a result of Cleopatra's claims over Caesarion's paternity and her support of Antony.\n\n1:58:55 Cleopatra just poured a bead of unmixed wine down Marc Antony's back and licked it off. Wtf, is that the ancient equivalent of snorting drugs off of someone? Because that would probably taste like wasted opportunity and a brothel. One more thing I never needed to see in a small screen historical adaptation.\n\n2:00:09 Antony never declared Cleopatra to be Caesar's legal wife, that would be obviously awkward considering that they *were* legally married...just not to each other. He did however declare that Caesarion was his true son so this series has finally gotten *something* right.\n\n2:01:09 Antony did not merely bestow Syria upon Cleopatra, he also bequeathed Cyprus, Cyrene, Cilicia, Media, Armenia and Parthia. And this was hardly an abrupt move, as this ceremony was nearly identical to the Donations of Antioch where Antony had bestowed similar titles on Cleopatra and her children with the important distinction being Antony's declaration of Caesarion's paternity and their treatment of Armenia and Parthia.\n\nSo I am going to cap off Part 2 and we will wrap up the last hour long segment next time with the Final War of the Roman Republic.",

        "text": "You may remember there was that whole shitstorm about people of colour in Roman Britain.  Two weeks ago, I saw an interesting comment about British folklore not including black kids.  Somehow, that disproves the presence of people of colour in Roman Britain.  [I commented about that in this post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6qdfhw/but_anyway_even_if_there_were_theres_no_evidence/?st=j6b2wn50&amp;sh=a12ab7ee)  I got a couple of interesting PMs, including one reading:\n\n&gt; Title: Why in the world would black Romans want to live in the UK?\n&gt; LOL\n\nThanks mate, good contribution, a bit anachronistic (considering the Acts of Union between England and Scotland were around in 1707, 1297 years after Rome's military withdrawal from Britain) but okay.\n\nI'd like to talk about an exchange between a certain redditor who will not be named and myself, which I'll talk about below.\n\nSo, the conversation starts with a PM titled \"W0t\", so you know we're dealing srs business from the get go.  The first message I get is:\n\n&gt;\"Can such late texts really contain genuine folklore from the Roman period\"\n\n&gt;Are you serious? We have evidence of Troy - Homer wrote about it hundreds of years after.\n\n&gt;Of course it can. Oral transmission. Also, you've ignored the primary sources of De Excidio, the Penitentiaries and the Letter to Coroticus, not to mention the Vergilius Romanus, which shows the Britons loved Vergil's Aenead (which has black characters in it, and indeed the illustrations show swarthy people) even in c. 500 AD.\n\nSo there's a few issues with this.  Firstly, the issue with the Trojan War is totally irrelevant to the issue of the legitimacy of the Gododdin and the poems of Taliesin (and I'd urge you to read the Gododdin and think to yourself if anyone actually had to be at the Battle of Catraeth to write the content - a partial, okay-ish translation is available [here](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/sechard/492godo.htm)).  Secondly, the Iliad and Odyssey are hardly accurate descriptions of a Trojan War, and there's still no evidence that chaps named Agamemnon and Achilles fought at the site of Troy against Hector and friends - I don't think anyone would really argue they reach a level that's beyond legendary.  Thirdly, oral transmission is not that valuable as a historical source, much less for events that happened hundreds of years before the stuff's written down.\n\nThe next part of this message sees my friend go completely off his rocker.  Firstly, none of the texts he mentions are examples of British folklore.  Gildas' *De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae* is, while valuable, a polemic against the current state of affairs in Britain, and is hardly a non-biased, accurate account of post-Roman Britain, with some of the events he describes having left no historical record.  It's also highly focussed in one area of Britain, describing kings based in the west.  St Patrick's *Epistola* is a letter addressed to a king named Coroticus, identified with Ceredig who supposedly ruled Alclud, criticising him for taking Christian slaves in Ireland and describing him as not of the Romans.  Finally, the Vergilius Romanus is a probable British manuscript of Virgil's *Aeneid*, not a British retelling.  Most importantly, none of them offer proof that there were non-white people living in Britain - while the Vergilius Romanus may show illustrations of non-white people, that's not proof that there were non-white people living in Britain, because it's perfectly reasonable to assume that the illustrators knew what they looked like anyway.\n\nI then get:\n\n&gt; Not only has folklore survived, unwritten, for 1700 years in some areas (the fourth century administrator of Atrebatia, Einion), it was written down in others.\n\nYeah, not really in medieval Britain.  A lot of it has been lost, leaving no trace (leading some scholars to argue for the existence of, for example, more branches of the Mabinogion).  Also, this \"Einion\" he talks about?  It's an attempt to link Saxon myths to historical events, which is a big nono in this sort of area - there's just no proof of it.\n\nI respond:\n\n&gt;Some areas maybe - not early medieval Britain, where decent primary sources are lacking and the stuff we have that may be folkloric unreliable sources on the events from 300 years previously\n\n&gt;Like read the Gododdin - what does it tell you about the ethnic makeup of post-Roman Britain?\n\nI get:\n\n&gt;Everything. Many of the warriors named are half-Saxons.\n\n&gt;Atrebatia and Einion are part of Early Medieval Britain.\n\n&gt;Folklore is an accurate historical source. Such as Noah's Flood or Ragnarok being inspired by the 700th century BC flood and the bad weather events of 535 respectively.\n\nNo, Atrebatia is not part of early Medieval Britain - there's no record of a polity based around the tribe of the Atrebates persisting in early Medieval Britain, and even if it did, by 600 the area would be thoroughly Anglo-Saxonised.  There's also no evidence that the warriors in the Gododdin were indeed half-Saxons, because there's no contemporary record confirming their existence (if you believe the Gododdin was not the genuine product of the sixth century), and all we have are genealogies from after the fact, which are incredibly, incredibly dodgy as historical source.  \n\nThen we get \"Folklore is an accurate historical source\" which is clear bullshit for reasons I've mentioned above and also in my other post.  Then there's the use of theory as fact.  I'll focus on Ragnarok.  Considering the rather major gaps in our knowledge of Norse mythology, thanks to sources written by Christians who weren't pagans, it's pretty hard to link events in mythology to actual historical events.  In fact, no one really knows where it came from - there are re theories related to Christian belief, volcanic explosions in Iceland, etc.  In short - it's pretty stupid to link folklore to historical events, and you're wading into r/badhistory when you do so, unless you have very strong proof (which we don't).\n\nI think what this guy needs to understand is the concept of a primary source, which is a source contemporary to the events its describing, and in general needs to spend more time studying historiography in general.\n\nI then get this message:\n\n&gt;No they wouldn't. Do society a service and top yourself.\n\nNice.\n\n\n\n**Sources: (fuck proper formatting i'm sick of this shit)**\n\nThomas Charles-Edwards, *Wales and the Britons*\n\nGavin Speed, *Towns in the Dark*\n\n*Edda*, translated by Anthony Faulkes\n\nVarious lectures and supervision reading",

It is time for the second part of my review of Fall of Great Empires – Alexander the Great and the Fall of the Persian Empire:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isQxUC_DILw \n\nSo let us continue!\n\n27.40: The narrator calls Persia a desert world. Again, Iran has many different types of climates, and the province of Pars also has forests, which is hardly indicative of an arid region DRINK!\n\n28.53: Another reference to Persia as a desert. DRINK!\n\n30.22: The narrator says the people of the Persian Empire were content. Even though the Achaemenid state was very tolerant, it should not be forgotten that it had expanded through conquest, and that the military was the basis of its power. Many cultures within the empire did not enjoy being ruled by a foreign people. For example, Egypt frequently revolted and was independent from 404 to 343 BC. DRINK!\n\n30.38: Yet another claim that Persia was a desert. DRINK!\n\n36.16: The narrator says it was the sarissa that decided the outcome of the war between Macedon and Persia. I disagree with this. Now, the sarissa phalanx was an incredibly deadly formation. It was difficult to defeat in frontal combat, and allowed soldiers to kill and hold off their opponents without risk to themselves. However, it was only one component of the Macedonian army. There was also light and heavy cavalry, missile troops, and light infantry. More importantly, it was a veteran force that practiced combined arms tactics and was led by experienced officers. As such, it was an army that was incredibly difficult to defeat in pitched battle. DRINK!\n\n36.46: The narrator calls the Macedonian phalanx an elite. The phalangites, or Foot Companions, were just regular infantry. It was the Hypaspists and Hetairoi heavy cavalry that were elite troops. DRINK!\n\n37.50: The narrator states that the Persian force at Gaugamela was made up of mercenaries. This is highly inaccurate. The core of the army was still native Persian troops. Arrian refers to a Persian guard unit, the Apple-Bearers, as forming the center of the battle-line. Other nationalities, which included Indians and Mardians, were levies from the satrapies and were thus part of the regular military structure of the Achaemenid empire. Greek mercenaries were present, but this was to supplement the Persian force, not replace it. DRINK!\n\n38.21: The narrator says the army of Alexander were fellow countrymen who worshipped him. The Macedonian army was in reality just as multi-national as the Persians. There were non-Macedonian Greeks, Thracians, Agrianians, Paeonians and Illyrians. There were also lots of complaints from his troops about his later conduct, so they hardly worshipped him. DRINK!\n\n38.23: Alexander's armor is clearly just fabric which was decorated to look like a linothorax. DRINK!\n\n38.28: More Pompeii-style gladii. DRINK!\n\n38.38: Obviously Alexander went to the 40K school of helmet wearing.\n\n39.42: MY GOD MAN! USE GLOVES WHEN YOU HANDLE CUNEIFORM TABLETS!\n\n40.41: Yet more Pompeii-style gladii. DRINK!\n\n41.31: The narrator and historians are excoriating Darius for retreating, but as the ruler of the Achaemenid empire it was critical that he escape. Without the King of Kings there could be no focal point for administration or organized military resistance. \n\n44.17: The narrator says Alexander advanced into Persia without much resistance. He actually encountered substantial resistance. At the Persian Gates Alexander was initially defeated by a commander named Ariobarzanes who forced Macedonian troops to retreat. It was only after pulling a Thermopylae that Alexander was able to outlank and vanquish the Persian general. DRINK!\n\n47.40: Reference to Darius as a king.

As someone who is not, by any means, an historian (as an engineer, I think I took one history class as an undergrad) it seems like this is a great history podcast. He seems to really do a ton of research and put a lot of care into making sure that he tells the story as accurately as he can, based on the sources he has.\n\nI'm just wondering what some of the actual historians of this sub think. \n\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for your responses! It sounds like my initial speculation was correct, that the show is a pretty good, entertaining intro to various history topics, but shouldn't be used as a source. So perfect for someone like me! And I'll be sure to check out some of the other pods mentioned!",

However, I stand by my arguments concerning the two specific claims made in the linked comment.**]\n\n*[Resubmitted because I missed a typo in the title]*\n\n---\n\nSubmission in question: https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6shkul/from_the_us_museum_of_holocaust/dld51hk/\n\n**Claim #1:**\n\n&gt; \"Hitler was extremely hostile to corporations. He confiscated many corporation owned properties and converted them into communal places for the people.\"\n\n**Sourced rebuttal #1:**\n\n&gt; 1. \"Since German business had a major stake in the struggle against the left, it should make an appropriate financial contribution. 'The sacrifice[s]', Goering pointed out, 'would be so much easier . . . to bear if it [industry] realized that the election of 5 March will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably even for the next hundred years.'\" (*Adam Tooze - The Wages of Destruction*)\n\n&gt; 2. \"In material terms, the consequences of demobilization made themselves felt in a shift in bargaining power in the workplace. In effect, the new regime froze wages and salaries at the level they had reached by the summer of 1933 and placed any future adjustment in the hands of regional trustees of labour (Treuhaender der Arbeit) whose powers were defined by the Law for the Regulation of National Labour (Gesetz zur Ordnung der nationalen Arbeit) issued on 20 January 1934. Often this is taken as an unambiguous expression of business power, since the nominal wage levels prevailing after 1933 were far lower than those in 1929. From the business point of view, however, the situation was rather more complex. Though wages had fallen relative to 1929, so had prices. In practice, the Depression brought very little relief to real wage costs. In so far as wage bills had been reduced it was not by cutting real wages but by firing workers and placing the rest on short time. Nevertheless, when the wage freeze of 1933 was combined with the destruction of the trade unions and a highly permissive attitude towards business cartelization, [...] the outlook for profits was certainly very favourable. (*Adam Tooze - The Wages of Destruction*)\"\n\n&gt; 3. \"Nachdrücklich machte er [Hitler] sich die Wünsche der Großwirtschaft zu eigen, indem er die Verringerung der Sozialausgaben im Reichshaushalt anordnete, um den Unternehmern steuerliche Vergünstigungen einräumen zu können. Er forderte sogar (was kein Interessenvertreter der Industrie öffentlich auszusprechen gewagt hätte), daß die steuerliche Belastung der privaten Unternehmen in den folgenden fünf Jahren nicht höher sein dürfe als im schwersten Krisenjahr 1932, in dem das private Steueraufkommen auf einen in den Zwanziger Jahren nicht gekannten Tiefstand abgesunken war. (*[Dieter Petzina - Hauptprobleme der Deutschen Wirtschaftspolitik 1931/1933](http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1967_1_2_petzina.pdf)* [PDF-Warning]) --- **Translation**: Hitler firmly adopted the wishes of the industry. He reduced social spending in order to reduce the tax burden on companies and even demanded that the tax load in the following five years must not exeed the rate set in the worst crisis year of 1932.\"\n\n&gt; 4. \"Although modern economic literature usually ignores the fact, the Nazi government in 1930s Germany undertook a wide scale privatization policy. The government sold public ownership in several State-owned firms in different sectors. In addition, delivery of some public services previously produced by the public sector was transferred to the private sector, mainly to organizations within the Nazi Party. Ideological motivations do not explain Nazi privatization. However, political motivations were important. The Nazi government may have used privatization as a tool to improve its relationship with big industrialists and to increase support among this group for its policies.\" ([Source](http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf) [PDF-Warning])\n\n&gt; 5. Companies were seized if they were Jewish: [Confiscation of Jewish Property in Europe](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Publication_OP_2003-01.pdf) [PDF-Warning]\n\n---\n\n**Claim #2:**\n\n&gt; \"The Nazis also created the most powerful union in German history. It was a government backed union called Deutsche Arbeitsfront that all german workers had to join.\"\n\n**Sourced rebuttal#2:**\n\n&gt; 1. \"Inexplicably, the socialist trade unions lulled themselves into believing that they might be able to cooperate with Hitler's government. They even joined with Hitler and Goebbels in orchestrating 1 May 1933 as a celebration of national labour, the first time that May Day had been treated as a public  holiday. On the day after, brownshirt squads stormed the offices of the trade unions and shut them down. Hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks in property and welfare funds were impounded. Robert Ley, a harddrinking Hitler loyalist, established himself in command of the new German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF). The dynamism of Nazi shopfloor activists (NSBO) had by this time reached proportions that were disturbing even to Ley. So, to restore order, the Reich appointed regional trustees of labour (Treuhaender der Arbeit) to set wages and to moderate conflicts between employers and rebellious Nazi shop stewards.\" (*Adam Tooze - The Wages of Destruction*)\n\n&gt; 2. \"The Nazis aimed to establish a state guided by racist, antisemitic and authoritarian principles, and as such deemed it necessary to bring all areas of civic life under government control.  Following a major celebration of May Day, all Trade Unions were closed down, their headquarters seized and their leaders attacked and imprisoned. German workers were forced to join a German Labour Front which controlled deductions for taxation and the Strength through Joy programme – a propaganda programme paid for by German workers.\" ([hmd.or](http://hmd.org.uk/content/02051933-dissolution-german-trade-unions))\n\n&gt; 3. \"Hitler aimed not only to secure complete control over all sources of state authority: he also sought the total mobilization of the general population behind the Nazi cause. To that end, he demanded the abolition of all competing organizations within public life, including the free trade unions. Although the Nazi government had already declared May 1st “National Labor Day” and was planning to celebrate it as a legal holiday with great pomp and ceremony, it was simultaneously making preparations for the final destruction of the unions, as is evident in the following directives issued on April 21, 1933, by Dr. Robert Ley (1890-1945), staff chief of NSDAP political organizations. Ley went on to oversee the National Socialist takeover of the unions by the German Labor Front [Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF].\" ([Source](http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/English7.pdf) [PDF-Warning])\n\n&gt; 4. \"Selbstverständlich wollten die Nationalsozialisten jede Form von Arbeitskämpfen, \"die wirtschaftliche Waffe, die der internationale Weltjude anwendet zur Zertrümmerung der wirtschaftlichen Basis der freien, unabhängigen Nationalstaaten .. .\" nach der Machtübernahme nicht mehr dulden.

        "text": "Today I am partaking of some low-hanging fruit, that is the 1999 Hallmark mini-series *Cleopatra*. For the record, I never actually watched the entirety of this before even though I read Margaret George's *Cleopatra*, the 1000 page ~~Cleopatra biography with accompanying OTP fan-fiction~~ sorry, \"fictional autobiography\", this is based on. So this will be a fun ride-along of first impressions as I force myself to finish this.\n\nThis mini-series is inconsistently acted, has an underwhelming production value and mutilates its own source material to create a confusing and often infuriating mess which you can enjoy on YouTube [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2F7TPVHcIhs). Basically I am splitting the two part 3 hour miniseries into three episodes so I can get into some bad details.\n\n0:00:10 *TEN*, literally ten seconds in and I have an easy few paragraphs of Bad History. See in the opening text it says: \n&gt;Egypt 47 BC, Cleopatra the twenty year old Queen of Egypt is in exile.\n\nYeah, no, she was at least 21-22 in 47 BC given that she was born 70-69 BC. But wait\n&gt; Her brother and sister have stolen the throne.\n\nNo, her brother Ptolemy XIII and a cadre of advisors have usurped her and forced her into exile, but Ptolemy is technically as rightful a monarch as her if not more so given that he was naturally next in the line of succession and their father left it in his will that they were to rule jointly as husband and wife according to tradition which *Cleopatra* originally supplanted by making herself de facto sole ruler. So the options for legitimate line of succession are:\nCrown passes to oldest living son = Ptolemy XIII.\nLast king's will is obeyed = Ptolemy XIII marries Cleopatra VII and they rule jointly.\nWill of Ptolemy X is obeyed and no one gets the throne because it goes to Rome.\n\nHer sister Arsinoe IV has not made a move yet so she has by no definition stolen anything, we can go around the bush as to whether the conspirators originally intended her to replace Cleopatra after their little coup d'état but as of yet Arsinoe appears to have been quiet as a mouse.\n\n&gt;Egypt is part of the Roman Empire and is in debt to Rome. The Great Julius Caesar and his army have come to Alexandria to collect the debt.\n\nNo. No. No. First of all, technically there is no \"Roman Empire\" yet, as historians still consider this period to be the Republican Era, hence the Final War of the Roman Republic happening at the *end* of this story. Although technically Rome never officially became a monarchy so do what you will with that. In any event, Egypt was not a truly a part of the Roman Republic or Empire or whatever you want to call it by this time.\nYou could call it a client-kingdom and that is true but it was not an organised province nor was it under the direct control of Rome, the reason this matters is because there is a world of difference between being at the mercy of something and being owned by it which is a nuance this series glosses over. Egypt was also was not technically \"in debt to Rome\" the crown was in debt to individual politicians which is different than owing the state. Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII incurred massive debt by taking out loans to pay off several Roman politicians including Aulus Gabinius, Pompey the Great and Julius Caesar in exchange for protection from annexation, restoration to the throne in the wake of his own usurpation by his wife and two eldest daughters Berenice and Cleopatra, the older half-sisters of this film's protagonist. Although *Cyprus* was annexed and his brother (the king of Cyprus) committed suicide which was embarassing, certainly, Egypt was still technically sovereign, they were just \"friends and allies\" and it would not be annexed until about 18 years after the start of this film.\n\nAnd *then* Julius Caesar did not just decide to visit Egypt and collect his debt, he came because he was following his vanquished foe Pompey the Great, who as it turns out had already been slain. Yes, he ended up demanding that they cough up his money but that is not why he found himself setting off from Pharsalus to Syria and eventually Egypt, he came because he was still finishing one of the largest and most important civil wars in Roman history.\n\n0:01:47 New Kingdom armour and weaponry (inaccurate New Kingdom armour and weaponry at that, look at those blue and gold headdresses) on Nubian guards in Alexandria when the film is set in the First Century BCE. For everyone not caught up on their Ptolemaic Egyptian history, by this time (that is to say roughly 300 years after its conquest by Alexander the Great) the core army consisted mainly of Greeks and Macedonians, with foreign mercenaries and also a large amount of Egyptian conscripts forming a large bulk of the fighting force. All of whom by this time they would also not be using the centuries outdated New Kingdom gear but be trained and outfitted in a fashion similar to Macedonian armies with the exception of mercenaries who decided to operate BYOA (bring your own armour) like the Roman Gabiniani (but they were not New Kingdom Egyptians either!)\n\nThe Romans are not dressed much better, they seem to be wearing armour from the Late Imperial period, instead of what fashionable Marian armies would be wearing. But military history is not my thing and this sub has some experts on the case already so I will mostly leave that alone.\n\n\nRoughly 0:02:30 This movie [brought to you by Snapple](http://m.imgur.com/yHEd0s1).\n\n0:04:10 Arsinoe had *not* made a bid for the throne when Caesar first landed in Egypt, so this scene should not involve her as a major player. Now Julius Caesar arrived in Alexandria while Ptolemy and his court were with an army preparing to attack Cleopatra's forces near Pelusium. They promptly returned to the capital but this will completely gloss over that as the drama of Caesar entering Egypt unfolds without mentioning Pompey even though his murder and Ptolemy's advisors gifting Caesar his head was a catalyst (or at least the excuse) for much of Caesar's initial actions. \n\n0:06:15 There is absolutely no reason to think that Cleopatra got advice/pep talk from a famous prostitute before seducing Julius Caesar. Sorry to disappoint but I can not find a source for that and even if I did hopefully the dialogue would be less stilted and cringy.\n\n0:12:00 [sighs, face palms] A secret panel room in the throne room? Sure, why the hell not, but no way am I supposed to accept a secret wall panel entrance to a bedroom presumably for seducing important guests. Who would even have commissioned that and moreover how often would it have been used and with *whom*? Feel free to speculate in comments.\n\n0:17:30 I love how this movie pushes Arsinoe as the primary in the civil war and not that she was proclaimed queen in the middle of the civil war by Alexandrians and then completely glosses over the idea that there was any political fallout for Caesar and Cleopatra in Alexandria after it was revealed that more than diplomatic relations were going on and accusations of favouritism got around. And by \"I love it\" I mean it fills me with pedantic rage, Arsinoe had not been proclaimed queen at this time so *why* is the movie goes out of its way to make a point of having it be Cleopatra vs Arsinoe. \n\n0:18:45 Oh my, how *absolutely shocking* for Cleopatra that Caesar expected her to marry Ptolemy XIII to seal the deal so they could betray Ptolemy later. Politically arranged incestuous marriage in the Ptolemaic dynasty? No, never! Cleopatra VII would have never entered a meaningless nominal marriage to a sibling for political purposes, not until the Nile flowed from the South and the Egyptians kneaded clay with their hands, and made their bread of barley. /s/s/s/s\nIt is not as if Cleopatra does not act like enough of a brat in this movie to begin with, the temper tantrum over something as arguably reasonable in context as that is just silly. Also this expositional argument is overly drawn out and informative when it comes to detailing Ptolemy XII's backstory with Rome.\n\n0:19:45 Cleopatra goes on a poorly acted (much cringe, such camp) mini rant about how if she had reigned instead of her father she would have had war with Rome instead of indignity. Honestly though, Cleopatra even in the beginning of her reign continued her father's pro-Roman policy (which was not too popular a stance in Alexandria) and never exactly developed a reputation for hating Romans and boldly seeking open conflict when an easier option suited her even better in the long run. Normally I do not nitpick with characterisation specifically but this is almost the anti-Cleopatra unless I missed her belligerent warmongering with Rome and refusal to be seen as a Roman collaborator, actually I think this scene was probably handwritten by Horace ^I^am^onto^you...\n\n0:26:00 More ridiculously inaccurate and anachronistic armour for the Egyptians. Minecraft armour,  obviously outdated bronze weapons that give me Middle Kingdom vibes and generally looking like they were conscripted by the Scorpion King. Why can I never get any hoplites in these adaptations, is it so much to ask for?! Also the battles in this movie remind me of History Channel docudramas. Not a good thing.\n\n0:27:32 Do not get me wrong, I like Julius Caesar as much as the next person but even the most hard-core, full-blown Caesarean, veteran of Alesia would object to this straight up glorification of his personal prowess in battle. I mean, he is like single handedly hacking through Egyptians like buttonmashing Ryse: Son of Rome on the easiest difficulty. His killstreak is insane.\n\n0:28:40 OK, no Cleopatra did not head down to the Library while it was burning, and was probably not even in Alexandria at the time. And will everyone stop circlejerking about the library already? \n\n0:30:00 Um, pretty sure Cleopatra just flipped an Egyptian cavalry officer off his horse with a spear like goddamned Eleria Sand while in the palace grounds going to the library. *Possibly*, or maybe that was the library. I still have no idea of *exactly* what is happening in this entire sequence but I may be simply subconsciously blocking off bullshit from myself. In any case whatever is going on did not happen and is approximately 99.89% absurdity.\n\n0:33:13 I just want to say that I am not joking but I mean it in utter seriousness that I have seen 5-9 year olds act out movie scenes and they all put more effort and authenticity into it than whatever Arsinoe is doing. That said they were incredibly talented children and I feel bad using them as the low-bar to measure this film against but at the same time...I expect more from a cast featuring Timothy Dalton and Billy Zane.\n\n0:33:20 Oh great, Ptolemy just died by falling out of his time travelling Maryannu chariot and drowning in the Nile.\n\n0:33:27 Why would Cleopatra be choosing to wear such a quintessentially Egyptian costume as the Horns of Hathor and this elaborate gold garb for an Alexandrian and Roman audience? Why are these Alexandrians wearing bad Egyptian Halloween costumes? *What* is Julius Caesar wearing? Exactly what is the purpose of this scene? What is my purpose in watching this?\n\n0:34:41 Cleopatra does ancient yoga.\n\n0:35:20 Historically, Arsinoe was present in Julius Caesar's triumph in 45 before ending up in the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus where she spent the last years of her life before Cleopatra got Marc Antony to have her killed. So unlike in this scene, Cleopatra did not have Arsinoe strangled in a dungeon in 47 BCE, she had her offed in a sacred Temple around 40 BCE despite Arsinoe being technically off-limits. Also Caesar actually *did* add her to his growing collection of political prisoners and paraded her in golden chains at his triumph before reluctantly sparing her life at the insistence of the sympathetic mob, so if there ever was a battle of wills over who would get Arsinoe, Caesar must have won but there is no reason to believe there was a battle of wills over it and having Arsinoe shipped away and killed or exiled was a great way to dispose of a potential threat without Cleopatra getting her hands dirty.\n\n0:38:13 I-just-killed-my-sister face.\n\n0:38:25 Jump-scarius Sieze-her.\n\n0:38:45 Fifty Shades BCE.\n\n0:38:50 So Julius Caesar just tried choking Cleopatra while they stand outside Arsinoe's death-dungeon cell and then followed up with sorry-I-just-choked-you face stroking, \"*you will not cross me again*\" and a hug. Honestly, 99% of my problem is probably the dungeon, if I lived to ripe old age and never saw an adaptation featuring Arsinoe getting strangled off screen before some gentler strangulation I would be content. At least the false wall in the throne room did not lead here.\n\n0:39:32 The hell kind of boat is this? It looks like a weird hybrid of an Egyptian barge and the bizarely huge Greek ships the Ptolemids supposedly commissioned except not bizarrely huge. Also yes, Egyptians and Nubians were pressed into service on ships in the early Ptolemaic period and there is reason to believe that they were a considerable presence after the suppression of the revolt in Upper Egypt by Ptolemy V, *but* there is no reason to think that Cleopatra's barge would have been manned exclusively by Nubians. And this movie goes out of its way to show a crazy amount of Nubians and I guess maybe Ethiopians working as guards and laborers that it borders on a black slave fetish. Even if Ptolemaic Egypt's *entire* Nubian population was enslaved I feel like this would be an excessive amount of black labourers, plus it feels weirdly racist and fetishistic given that we only ever see a disproportion of ultra muscular blacks doing half naked manual labour but not anything else? Even Cleopatra's bodyguard is half naked Nubian men which is just inaccurate. All in all I am not a naval engineer or even naval historian but everything about the way this boat seems to be run seems slightly off like they just added rowing and ropes and hoped it looked good on camera. As it happens it does not and neither does the green screen.\n\n0:39:43 mfw \"cleverly\" disguised modern leather furniture finds its way into the first century BCE. \n\n0:39:45 Julius Caesar says he feels like he is in paradise. Counterpointing that poignantly is the fact that right about now I feel like I must be in ~~purgatory~~ perdition. Also did the writers know that this sentimental river-cruise affection scene would be literally be right after sister-murder-strangley-affection time when they were writing this or was this editing room magic? I want to believe the latter because my brain is confused. And exasperated. And mildly bored but still somewhat amused.\n\n0:46:14 Ok technically there is no way to ascertain Caesarion's birth date, but he was in all likelihood born sometime in summer and was conceived around the Siege of Alexandria, meaning Julius Caesar was probably aware that Cleopatra was pregnant by the time he left Egypt. I am not really sure why I am complaining because this is still way more accurate than HBO and Liz Taylor's versions which feature Caesar sticking around for Caesarion's birth so he can have a dramatic \"Behold, my son!\" moment.\n\n0:46:46 Cleopatra actually had to deal with \"famines, ~~revolts~~, riots\" in the 3 years before Caesar turned up (droughts and debt will do that) and took an active hand in trying to restore order and prosperity. This \"you can not lean on Caesar for everything\" character development is as contrived as her growth from being a reckless, conflict-seeking warmonger, there is basically every reason to think that Cleopatra wanted to rule not shirk the administration of Egypt off on Caesar. Also, can I point out that Cleopatra's reign is known for being relatively *free* of revolt and internal strife? Outside of the Alexandrine Wars she never had any significant opposition and this was with her being outside of Egypt in Italy, Syria, Anatolia, for long stretches when any homegrown revolt or usurpation would have a marked advantage, making her something of an exception to the general rule with later Ptolemies so this conflict is really contrived.\n\n0:47:09 Wow, Republican Rome looks a bit too Imperial for my tastes but I guess anachronistic architecture is to be expected in any movie where Alexandria looks so Egyptian.\n\n0:48:44 Marc Antony is over yelling \"I object\" like this is a televised court case. That would explain a lot. Also I see they predicted his eyeliner in *Rome*, because everyone knows Antony's life motto \"Roses are red, I wanna die, Make-up is fucking great for a guy.\"\n\n0:49:22 Hahaha, Brutus calls Egypt \"useless\" , temporarily forgetting Egypt's official title of \"bread producing cash cow\" in Latin. For those wondering, that is not a reference to Hathor as is often claimed but to Mooby the Golden Calf whose ritual importance pervaded Roman political rhetoric at this time. *^The ^last ^part ^is ^not ^true...\n\nSeriously though, Egypt was so economically important that Brutus' statement is insane. Only modern audiences think of Egypt as a desert, Brutus should know better and his fellow Romans should not agree if he starts up with something ignorant like that.\n\n0:50:00 Ok cool dramatic reveal scene but did everyone in Rome not know about Julius Caesar's campaigns in Africa and Pontus and Asia Minor and solving the mutinying soldiers in Italy and well everything else besides that directly affected most everyone present, is that even possible? Maybe the lead in the water was already causing mass amnesia by this time. Also at the point in time where you are cutting down and condensing parts of Cleopatra's life and reign to better expound on Caesar's, just call it Caesar &amp; Cleopatra or something to that effect because it is obvious that this miniseries has more than one star.\n\n0:52:10 Julius Caesar *invited* Cleopatra to Rome, and several other Eastern client-kings also visited Rome around that time for diplomatic purposes. I mean, you know, all of them were probably not also having sex with Caesar but those are just details really. The salient point is that her visiting him was not any act of defiance and her presence in the city was not unprecedented, and although her visit stirred up *some* controversy it was hardly the primary worry on everyone's minds in 45 BCE. Also why does Rufio care about the paternity drama going on with Caesarion?\n\nI wondered how long I could stand her accent, it turned out to be exactly 52 minutes and 44 seconds. I spent too much time in Latin America for this to sound exotic or \"Near Eastern\", this is like the spiritual successor to the British Romans, and Portuguese Caesarion's of films past but more arbitrary.\n\n0:53:15 The flail and crook was an important royal icon in Dynastic Egypt but not Ptolemaic kings in Alexandria.\n\n0:53:35 Yeah...no. No matter how badly this movie wants Cleopatra's character to develop and her to notice the plight of the people and be the leader they need at last, her policy towards the people is not noticeably different after Caesar leaves Egypt. She passed legislature addressing the distribution of grain during famine from the earliest beginnings of her reign, given that famine struck in her first year, not letting everyone starve was near the top of her list. The man being tried says \"No wonder the people hate you. They are your children but you give them nothing but fear.\" Obviously this is untrue because she passed an edict ordering all grain to be handed over to the state and anyone caught disobeying was killed. Since subsidised grain was distributed to the people and informants were given 1/3 of the property of the individual convicted while slaves got 1/6 and their freedom, she gave them fear, bread, property and sometimes freedom which might explain her popularity. Also why is Rufio advising Cleopatra?!\n\n0:54:50 There is no reason to think that Rome's grain tribute would require *everything* in the royal granaries. Even if we go with a high end estimate of 200,000 tons exported to Rome and a poor harvest of 800,000 tons. Now the tribute was likely nowhere near the high end estimates of grain exportation from the Roman province of Egypt, and we can still reasonably expect a grain yield of at least 1 million tons without being unrealistic, even if there were not grain stores left over from previous years due to consecutive famines, *and* the amount of grain exported was not adjusted, there should still be a sizeable supply. Would people have starved? Absolutely, but not solely due to Roman demands and the debt the Ptolemaic dynasty owed to Roman politicians made itself felt fiscally more than anything else.  \n\n0:55:16 I mentioned that Cleopatra distributed grain but I have never read anything about opening a silo and telling everyone to take grain. I mean, at least one guy would just keep coming back in different clothes, even *if* people did not go crazy fighting over it, why would anyone distribute food like this? \n\n0:55:45 Cleopatra said \"In the name of my unborn child\" but technically, it would not have a name yet now would it? ;-) Also that fake pregnancy bump is REALLY fake looking. \n\n1:00:05 Marc Antony was not sent to intercept Cleopatra on her entrance to Rome, really why would that be necessary and out of everyone Caesar could send why choose Antony? I feel like he would be near the bottom of that list given how Caesar felt about him. But the movie has to kickstart some romantic tension between these two by the second act so here goes some inaccurate closeness between Antony and Cleopatra prior to Caesar getting shivved because \"romance\" is essential to these adaptations. Not that I complain about seeing more Billy Zane, but still. \n\nAlso Antony says of Caesar \"I *love* him\". Take that Antony/Curio shippers!\n\n1:03:10 Just completely glossing over Cleopatra's diplomatic reasons for visiting Rome, like renewing Egypt's treaty with Rome or meeting with any Roman politicians? Ok.\n\n1:04:12 Cleopatra is angry that Caesar sent her *no* letters after leaving Egypt but this does not seem likely because Dio in a possibly fabricated or embellished story tells how Cleopatra tried to use the letters Caesar sent her as proof of their mutual love in a bid to convince Octavian to be merciful. Although this story takes place around 15 years after this scene Caesar's assassination on the Ides of March 44 means that all of these letters had to be authored before her second visit to Rome, with this sequence being a mish mash of her first and second visits. So basically we can not be sure but the only evidence implies that he did write her numerous times and that she received and held onto these letters. \n\n1:04:53 Cleopatra says \"His name is Ptolemy Caesar, but I've taken to calling him Caesarion.\" Actually apparently it was the Alexandrians who gave him the nickname but it had a way of sticking to him as evidenced by the name's longevity. Caesar had previously asked \"Whose is it?\" which is...interesting, although Octavian did raise doubts as to his paternity we do not know exactly what the basis of these claims was, although many scholars have cited the timing of his conception we actually have no evidence of when this was so speculation over it is dubious, having Caesar make that statement implies that he at least sees a possibility that Caesarion's father was someone else's even though we never have any further indication of that possibility in this film. This is not badhistory but I want to point out that subtext implying even with what we *think* we know about the film, maybe there should be doubt, which is nice for anyone who is into history and is 100% better than \"About your father...\" I am not getting over that arc, is this how Medievalists feel about William Wallace fathering that French king in Braveheart, because if so I feel for you.\n\n1:05:05 Caesar says \"You had a child and didn't tell me?!\" but there is a good chance that Cleopatra would have been visibly pregnant by the time he left Egypt and it is implied that part of the reason she visited was for him to be able to meet Caesarion. In any case, the news that she had a son some months after he left Egypt should probably have reached him in the nearly *two years* that passed in between, how could this be a surprise to him in 45 BCE?\n\n1:06:00 Nothing like fanfare played by Roman soldiers using instruments that had not yet been invented to set the tone for a dramatic scene in which Cleopatra meets Caesar's family as well as a host of other characters like Cassius that would totally not be invited to the same semi-intimate setting in Caesar's home. Seriously, this is excellent and oh my a ridiculously heavy gold set of the Horns of Hathor that she would never have actually worn especially not in Rome, lovely.\n\n1:06:45 Octavian was not known to be Caesar's heir at this time, all the smart money was on Antony or Brutus but Octavius was under everyone's radar. And then Brutus says \"There are no kings here your majesty.\" I mean, except for all the client kings that were visiting Rome at this time. Also \"your majesty\"?\n\n1:07:18 It is a little known fact that the writers saw this scene and said \"Gee, what a wonderfully underwhelming triumph to be surrounded by famous buildings that did not exist. We should totally do this again but with 20% more red paint.\" Thus HBO graced us with more armoured troops within Rome, lackluster processions and anachronism. What they both need is 100% more gladiatorial combat, extravagance, exotic animals, and Arsinoe IV. I demand blood and water on the Campus Martius!\n\n1:07:53 Uh what? Caesar's Egyptian triumph was quite clearly a celebration of his victory over Ptolemy and Arsinie not Cleopatra, and although the balance of power in their relationship seems to have been perfectly clear the line between Caesar's mistress and Rome's conquered enemy is *pretty* clear. At least, those two things would not come together for around 15 years.\n\n1:08:05 I find the lack of red paint on Caesar displeasing.\n\n1:08:15 There is no reason to think that Cleopatra was mocked by the crowd, from most accounts of the triumph that the soldiers sang some humorous jokes at Caesar's expense and these may well have included Cleopatra at some point but there is no literary evidence for her being singled out or the focus of Caesar's triumph, all in all it seems like this movie presents Cleopatra as a stand in for Arsinoe's humiliation but that is just problematic. And even Arsinie apparently earned the admiration and pity of the Roman people. And when Octavius informs her that they are calling her \"Caesar's whore\" this is somewhat anachronistic, as this popular sentiment is not evidenced until after death although some individuals at the time, mainly Cicero, did not like her already, the majority of the Roman populace does not seem to have felt strongly towards her until the events surrounding the Final War of the Roman Republic.\n\n1:09:24 At this point I am not sure whether to comment on the fact that there is a guy dressed as what appears to be a satyr or that all of these Roman matrons are wearing bright colours and a *lot* of gold to the point that they resemble Hellenistic queens, so instead I will complain about whoever keeps shouting \"The Queen *of Egypt*!\" whenever Cleopatra enters the room.\n\n\n1:10:30 Wtf? I am not sure what is worse, Cleopatra ruining a perfectly good party or the idea that Cleopatra could just walk up like \"Ayy, this is totally Caesar's kid btw!1!! Lmfao get rekt Octavian\" and like that Caesar has no choice but to recognize him as his son? It was hardly as if a foreign, *married*(everyone forgets this part) queen could just waltz up and basically bestow paternity on their own child via social pressure. Honestly even if he said that Caesarion was without a doubt his son and famously brimmed over with paternal affection in public settings, he would not have been legitimate by Roman standards so this is just a weird hill for basically every adaptation to die on. And as far as we know Caesar never publicly recognised him as his son.\n\nIt bothers me a lot more than it should how the \"Caesar picks up Caesarion in front of the Roman crowd and declares him his son\" moment is such a lasting trope. Where does the idea of baby-handling = legal obligation even come from? Brutus literally says \"No you touch him, you CLAIM him!\" which is just stupid, even if this scene were not fabricated. And really, *why* would Caesar sacrifice his public image to claim paternity of an infant? Even *if* he thought Caesarion would be useful to him further down the line or he genuinely wanted to be his father it would not make any sense for him to declare paternity, at least not until Caesarion was somewhat grown. If we take into account the fact that he kept it on the down low that he had made Octavius his heir or the rumours that he thought Decimus Brutus or Marcus Junius Brutus or Junia Tertia was his child and kept his mouth shut for years, it is not a stretch to say he had the restraint to not just claim Caesarion outright. And at this point would Cleopatra have wanted him to *legally* be Caesar's heir? I think not, if that would have come along with citizenship and the fact that Romans do not feel so positive about Roman kings. The primary thing she went after seems to have been acknowledgement, Julius Caesar saying that he was the biological father and the advantage that would have followed that, most attempts to attack Octavian's claims by using Caesarion's paternity would have been laughable legally given the presence of Caesar's will and Octavian's seniority (not to mention...citizenship) this is a pretty important nuance that I have never seen properly expressed on-screen. Acknowledgement and legitimacy were not the same thing, one is bitterly contested where Caesarion is concerned, the other is impossible from a Roman perspective and I do not think this would be lost on Cleopatra given her apparent understanding of Rome in other areas, the issue of Caesarion's paternity also made him technically illegitimate from an *Egyptian* perspective so this was nothing shocking. The fact that every adaptation doubles down on the acknowledgement ≠ legitimacy later on means that the baby lifting was meaningless so why emphasise its meaning like some sacred inviolable action in the first place if the baby holding was *not* an enormous geature? Is it just a device for substanceless drama without any regard for sense?\n\nSo far this series is pretty bad but I am going to close here before any inaccurate closeness between characters develops or something tragic happens (slip in the shower, get stabbed 23 times in the abdomen etc) \n\nThe worst part is, this is one of the more accurate adaptations in a lot of ways, although there are things that Liz Taylor's adaptation and *Rome* did better from a cinematic viewpoint, on the whole this presents one of the most nuanced portrayals of the relationship between Egypt and Rome, as well as doing a decent job of not depoliticising the relationship between Cleopatra and Caesar creating a film that overall gives a more balanced picture for general audiences but I still hate all the places it stumbles unnecessarily and wastes its source material, all this tells me is how low the bar really is for accuracy. \"*Oh gee, there are no Zulu dancers and Cleopatra is not an Egyptian Lindsay Lohan, A++!*\" I mean, it yes this makes more sense than *Rome* or a film compared to *Ben Hur* but that is like saying Spartacus makes more sense than 300, not really a compliment.\n\nCome back next time for episode 2: *Days of Our Lives of the Caesars*!

        "text": "Ok, full disclaimer, I've never watched *Adam Ruins Everything* anywhere else so I don't know if it's on purpose that he's supposed to act like the [smuggest douche for the entire video](http://i.imgur.com/oLmIfpf.png) but I'll go ahead and assume that it's not satire, and that what we're supposed to do is join him in self-absorbed superiority while they present wikipedia-level understanding of history as obvious fact. This has the benefit of giving *him* the benefit of the doubt since he could be doing persona, but the con of them purposefully instead of accidentally contributing to the overall smug of levels polluting the world. \n\nAlright, the video is short so I don't have to suffer for too much. But it's still too long. Y'All owe me.\n\n**Michelangelo Started His Career Off As A Forger**\n\n[00:30](http://i.imgur.com/KXfh0wn.png) Ok, so the video starts off the claim that Michelangelo started his career as \"a forger\". \n\n&gt;\"Should I make a 'Madonna'\" the intrepid Michelangelo actor wonders, \"Or a giant David with-ah tiniest of the wee-wees\". \n\n&gt;\"But did you know,\" Adam smugly says smugly \"That this master of originality actually started his career as a forger?\"\n\n&gt;\"Or I could just knock off some Roman thing.\" Loser-Michelangelo shrugs and trudges off.\n\nLeading all of the hundreds of thousands of people who watch *Adam Ruins Everything* to conclude that Michelangelo was a hack. \n\n&gt;In the late 1400s everything Roman was all the rage, and just like today it was a lot easier to sell a classic than something by an up-and-coming artist.\" Smug Adam smugly says smugly. \"So according to his first biographer, Michelangelo cooked up a scam\".\n\nOk. Putting aside the... problems with his first biographer, this is wrong, even without taking into account that they are taking a primary source at its face value. Every single second-rate hobbyist historian with something to prove is of course going to dive straight into the primary sources without a second thought. This gives them the surface-level benefit of being more \"real\" than all the professionals who actually do this for a living by \"hitting the raw source\" without giving two whits of thought to extenuating circumstances or any of the voluminous amount of literature and schools of thought written on any subject at all and therefore gives them the freedom to draw their own conclusions, accuracy and context be damned, which is rather like putting a bucket on your head and having the freedom of running around blind until you trip, hit a light pole or get run over by cement mixer, upon which you announce you meant to do that all along and this explains why the Jews did it.\n\nThe thing is, *Adam Ruins Everything* can't even get that right, JFC. \n\n**Michelangelo Cooked Up A Scam**\n\n[01:04](http://i.imgur.com/Nzh6evb.png)\n\nHere is the relevant passage from *Lives of the Artists* by Giorgio Vasari, who had written a sort of anthology of biographies of the artists of the Renaissance in question that states:\n\n&gt;[There he made for Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici a S. Giovannino of marble, and then set himself to make from another piece of marble a Cupid that was sleeping, of the size of life. This, when finished, was shown by means of Baldassarre del Milanese to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco as a beautiful thing, and he, having pronounced the same judgment, said to Michelagnolo: **\"If you were to bury it under ground and then sent it to Rome treated in such a manner as to make it look old, I am certain that it would pass for an antique, and you would thus obtain much more for it than by selling it here.\"**](http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariMichelangelo2.html)\n\nLook at the sentence before it. Literally the sentence before it. What does it say? \n\n&gt; **Lorenzo di Pier Francesco** as a beautiful thing, and he, having pronounced the same judgment, said to Michelagnolo: \"If you were to bury it under ground ...\n\nLorenzo di Piero Francesco di Medici. \n\n&gt;[Michelangelo cooked up a scam](http://i.imgur.com/Nzh6evb.png)\n\n&gt;Lorenzo di Piero Francesco di Medici. \n\n&gt;[Mikel angelou cooked](http://i.imgur.com/vnYS6nV.png)\n\n&gt;Leornzo\n\n&gt;http://i.imgur.com/jQ7l4Ma.png\n\nFor an TV show ostensibly about correcting misconceptions, they seem to be playing awfully fast and loose with their methodology. Or reading comprehension. Literally in the sentence before of the primary source that they blindly cite without any nuance they get it wrong and completely cut out the man who supposedly suggested this forgery in the first place, Lorenzo di Piero Francesco di Medici, a member of a cadet branch of the Medici and friend of Michelangelo after he returned to Florence after an unfruitful session spent following the Medici to Bologna after Lorenzo di Medici proper died and Piero the Unfortunate's mismanagement of Florence leads to the main branch of the Medici being ousted from Florence. They portray Michelangelo as having \"cooked up as scam\" by himself, unable to make it big, rather than how it was actually told, where his friend Lorenzo di Piero told him that the Cupid he carved looked so good and life-like that with just a little dressing, it could pass for a Classic, which was considered to be a high compliment, so much so that Michelangelo decided to improvise the sculpture to look as such, or the dealer who sold the sculpture buried it to make it look old. The key point-- the forefront-- is NOT that Michelangelo committed fraud or made a forgery. The key point, is that Michelangelo was good enough to make it succeed fraudulently, which of which Lorenzo di Piero's stated comment on Michelangelo's statue is key. But the show omits it, why.\n\nThe sons of bitches who wrote this show concocted this glaring omission, I assume, because they:\n\n1) Either have a very dim view of their viewership and didn't want to confuse and bamboozle their middle-school viewers by adding a single other person to their already over-simplified story which, assuming the kind of person who would like this smug drivel, is fair enough I suppose.\n\n2) Were too lazy to properly portray the story, and didn't want to put in the extra effort and actor when they could just broadcast libel since the subject in question has been dead for almost five centuries. Why work as hard, when they could instead portray the greatest artist of all time as an equally lazy of a hack as they are. Which for a educational TV show about correcting misconceptions makes writers of said show not only lazy, but hypocritical pieces of shit.\n\n3) Did about thirty-eight minutes of research on Cracked.com, afterwards the show writer on the team who was too slow to \"Nose Goes\" types their findings from their Macbook Pro letter-by-letter into a group text where they quickly cobble together their shit-stained script. After they get through the boring part of *research* and *historical method* they move onto what they actually want to do, [which is to make dick jokes](http://i.imgur.com/KlskynT.png) while reruns of Impractical Jokers covers their unwatchable asses by inflating their undeserved numbers. \n\nThis, even past all of that, is completely ignoring the other problem-- which is that they are taking Giorgio Vasari at his word. Vasari, who bald-faced lied in his second edition of Lives of the Artists to make Bartolommeo Bandinelli look like a vindictive asshole who tore a cartone done by Michelangelo to shreds. What these unfunny, [fedora-tipping](http://i.imgur.com/QiWphub.png) mythbusters-wannabe hacks don't realize is that Vasari isn't interested in writing a historical account, despite pretty much everyone else's suicidally-determined intentions to use Vasari's *Lives* otherwise. What Vasari set out to do was construct a cohesive narrative of the art of his day, and how the qualities presented by the artists he approved of detailed in *Lives* paralleled and portrayed qualities that he believed affected good art and how these qualities of art affected the entire cultural movement of the world that he lived in. Historical accuracy came second to educating the generations after as to what was proper art, how the seminal artists reflected that proper art and who was an asshole, because \"Bandinelli was totally an asshole\" citation Vasari, Life of Bandinelli. \n\n[I will give the show writers only a little bit of credit in that this story is corroborated in Condivi's version of Michelangelo's biography in  *Life of Michelangelo*.](http://www.freeinfosociety.com/media/pdf/4760.pdf) This, however, only gives the original story little more credibility. It was just as likely that Michelangelo was flattered by it and decided to keep the story in to bolster his legacy, or that perhaps Michelangelo himself was approached to be interviewed when Vasari first was writing *Lives* and that it was Michelangelo himself who started the rumor. For all Michelangelo's virtues as an artist, the man himself was likely not above embellishing or aggrandizing for the sake of his family's legacy, since he had much to live up to, having grown up under lofty stories of the Buonarroti family's legendary ancestors, the Counts of Canossa and entering the much more risky venture of producing art. Michelangelo would be plagued by worry for his family's and more specifically, his name's legacy, so much so that despite his actual, verifiable patrician ties with nobility from his mother's side^1, Michelangelo chooses to put his supposed descent from the Counts of Canossa to the forefront instead. This would have been a far more humanizing and accurate portrayal of Michelangelo that the *Adam Ruins Everything* could have done, [instead of doing Super Mario talking about tiny wee-wees.](https://youtu.be/_ioCYKZn6fo?t=38s).\n\n**Michelangelo Was Flagrantly Copying Older Sculptures**\n\n[01:21](http://i.imgur.com/hBNdlM8.png) \n\nFuck you. Literally not a single word after \"Michelangelo\" and \"Was\" is right. Not even the plural of sculptures at the end. This is libel. This is an actual lie and it's infesting the minds of the impressionable teenagers who watch your garbage and actually believe it. \n\n\"Flagrantly Copying Older Sculptures\". What, pray tell, is he copying? By the primary source your show cites (which you guys did, abysmally) Michelangelo carved the sculpture first -- then his friend Lorenzo said that it looked so good, it could pass for an antique. What exactly is flagrant or copying about carving in a Greco-Roman style? The only dishonest factor there is that Michelangelo supposedly then claimed his *original work* was actually older than it actually was after alterations. None of that is 'flagrant', or 'copying'. Supposedly fraudulent, sure. But 'Flagrant Copying' is something else entire. If we are to take the primary source at face value, Michelangelo first carved a sculpture which was then fraudulently passed off as an antique, and no where is there any of the flagrantly implied plagiarism. Inspiration is not plagiarism, although I could see how such an uninspired group of show writers may confuse the two.\n\nNEXT. \"Older Sculptures\"? Plural?! You mentioned *one*. Michelangelo maybe made ONE fraudulent sculpture. One sculpture that was NOT 'flagrantly copied' but may have been slightly altered to be passed off as older than it actually was. Where in hell does the plural come from? The only other possibility is the theory that Michelangelo forged the Laocoön, which was a theory spearheaded *twelve years ago* by a Professor Lynn Catterson, and the [theory itself has a number of questionable parts to it, to put it lightly](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/apr/27/1). I assume that since I can find no where else that mentions this Laocoon forgery theory since Professor Lynn Catterson's original publication that this theory has never gained traction in the art history community. Nevertheless I have rented Professor Catterson's article on JSTOR and will contact my old art history professor on this theory and will edit this post if I feel like her ideas does deserve any merit. She is after all, a professor of art history at Columbia and deserves that respect no matter what type of asshole uses her work for cheap entertainment. Not that *Adam Ruins Everything* deserves any of the credit for literally any of this at all even if her theory does hold water, since at max we bring that sculpture count to TWO, which is very different from your bullshit \"Flagrantly Copying Older Sculptures\" would imply. \n\nJFC, following the only source that this garbage video cities is like watching a game of telephone being played in slow motion. Michelangelo first carves a sculpture so well that his friend mentions he could pass it off as an antique, then he possibly starts off the chain of embellishments with the man himself possibly exaggerating a story into him actually tricking a cardinal, which then passes to a garbage article on the internet retelling the tale from Vasari's mouth wholesale which is like showing a picture of the ass-half of a horse and calling it a unicorn, which passes to a garbage show on TruTV where they say \"Michelangelo was flagrantly copying older sculptures\". I don't want to see what the next line of telephone looks like. I'd rather put cement blocks in my trunk and drive off a cliff and into the ground.\n\nI don't know if all of the other segments of *Adam Ruins Everything* are this bad. I sincerely hope not. The only wish I have left is that when I'm watching my *Impractical Jokers* that I don't accidentally run into *Adam Ruins Everything* and give it one more view count that it doesn't deserve. \n\nAdam 'ruins everything' indeed.\n\n1. Michelangelo's mother, Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena, was an actual noble who was descended from two noble merchant families, the Del Sera (di Siena) and the Rucellai. She died when Michelangelo was six, having probably married Michelangelo's father when she was in her early teenage years as was customary for a young woman of the times. I will put forwards that another potential reason as to why Michelangelo would bury his patrician ties from his mother, besides not knowing his mother at all since she died when he was young, is because through her, he was related to the Medici family proper by marriage, and during Michelangelo's later life the Medici were seen as despotic tyrants. Regardless of his reasons to attempt to ignore his mother's lineage, his comes off as very concerned about family legacy in his inter-familial letters in particular. \n\nSources used: \n\n* [Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori](http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariMichelangelo2.html), *Giorgio Vasari*\n\n* [Vita di Michelagnolo Buonarroti](http://www.freeinfosociety.com/media/pdf/4760.pdf), *Ascanio Condivi*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With World War II in full swing this entire final half hour is dedicated to dishonestly portraying what happened in the war.\n\n(1:02:53)- Well we’re off to a great start in this segment with the film trying to paint Hitler’s failure at Dunkirk as an act of kindness. How in the heck does the film possibly think that Hitler “in a spectacular gesture chooses not to annihilate the British expeditionary force at Dunkirk”. That’s just plain false. Hitler didn’t choose to not annihilate the B.E.F., he failed to annihilate the B.E.F. For reasons that are still debated Hitler held back his tank divisions possibly because either the tanks had advanced too far ahead of the infantry or because Hitler was worried about the muddy terrain in France that he had fought in in WWI. Regardless of why the tanks did not engage the Luftwaffe were believed to be sufficient to deal with the remaining allied armies until the rest of the army could advance. While the evacuation was happening the Allies fought the German army and airforce who were trying to stop their retreat. This failure to stop the British and French forces from retreating across the English Channel is one of Germany’s largest mistakes in the war and it most certainly was not a conscious decision made by Hitler to purposely let the Allied armies escape.\n\n(1:03:41)- The Germans agreed to the Soviet Union occupying the Baltic states and Bessarabia in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact so I’m not sure why the film is portraying this as the Soviets betraying the Germans.\n\n(1:03:50)- So the film is implying that Stalin broke off the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by stating that Stalin broke his non-aggression pacts with “all six of his neighbors” this is confusing because the Soviet Union had more than six neighbors at the time. It’s also wrong because the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact remained in place until it was broken by the Nazis with the launching of Operation Barbarossa\n\n(1:04:08)-Now the film is talking about how tens of thousands of innocent civilians were murdered by the Soviets while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge that the Holocaust was happening. This movie is ridiculous.\n\n(1:04:43)-Still can’t find any evidence or details regarding Hitler offering peace in 1940 besides the book I mentioned at 57:46 in part 3 of this analysis. A book which was written by an actual Nazi and isn’t very credible.\n\n(1:07:00)- Still no credible evidence of these more than two dozen offers of peace supposedly sent from Hitler to the British, but even assuming that they exist we are told nothing about the contents of these supposed peace offers and how reasonable or unreasonable the terms may have been. This is done to deceive the audience into thinking Hitler was an advocate of peace rather than the warmonger that he actually was. \n\n(1:07:11)- So I did some googling and found this document Summary of Principal Peace Feelers September 1939 March 1941 that the film is touting as some genuine attempt made by the German government at securing peace with the United Kingdom. The issue with this document being used as evidence of Hitler wanting peace is that it clearly says it’s not from Hitler. The document pretty clearly says on the first page that the prime mover was Goring and that he was asking the British to accept peace if he replaced Hitler as head of the Third Reich. The reason this was never taken seriously was that it was unverifiable that Goring had the means to carry out this coup and if his attempts at making peace were genuine. So it’s not at all the damning piece of evidence that the movie is claiming it is.\n\n(1:09:15)- The argument that the British were warmongers because they didn’t want peace with Carl Goerdeler if he were head of the Third Reich is idiotic. The movie is correct in stating that Carl Goerdeler was a member of the German resistance as he was a German monarchist and despite supporting Hitler initially he would join in the attempt to assassinate hitler on July 20th 1944. However the British wouldn’t have known that Goerdeler was a member of the resistance as up until that plot failed he was believed to have been loyal to the Nazis due to his job in the German government as the Reich Price Commissioner. It therefore would have been very reasonable for the British to not want Goerdeler as Fuhrer since they believed him to be just another Nazi.\n\n(1:14:01)- So using this Stalin speech from May 5th 1941 is a bogus justification for Germany launching Operation Barbarossa. This speech happened seven weeks before Operation Barbarossa began and the speech was not a public address, it was delivered to members of Stalin’s inner circle and graduates of the Frunze Military Academy. The press coverage at the time of the speech was merely that Stalin gave a speech to the graduates on May 5th and there was nobody else in attendance. This means that there’s no way the Germans could have known about the speech before Operation Barbarossa began. This isn’t just postulating though as Adolf von Thadden revealed after the war that the only reason the nazis knew about the speech that Stalin gave on May 5th was because they had pieced its contents together from the recollections of Soviet officers who had been at the ceremony and were captured by the Nazis. This speech cannot be used as a vehicle for Hitler to “learn Stalin’s true intentions” because Hitler didn’t know what Stalin said until after Hitler had already invaded the Soviet union.\n\n(1:17:43)- Maybe the film should elaborate a little on what happened to those Soviet prisoners of war. Maybe they should mention how 500,000 of those Soviet prisoners of war would end up in the concentration camps that this movie refuses to acknowledge exist. Or how over 600,000 of them would be used as slave laborers and were treated as sub-humans and many were literally worked to death.\n\n(1:19:46)- Captured German troops were discovered to have been murdered with their hands tied behind their backs!?! Who would do such a dreadful thing as murdering prisoners of war!?! In all honesty I don’t have a problem with the movie mentioning Soviet mistreatment of German prisoners. What I take issue with is the movie bringing up Soviet mistreatment of German prisoners while ignoring the Holocaust and the Germans shipping Soviet prisoners of war off to concentration camps.\n\n(1:20:02)- Hold the phone, I think I just heard the phrase “German war crimes” said in this documentary! This is astounding! The documentary isn’t going to mention what these war crimes were but at this point my expectations are so low that I’m shocked that the phrase “German war crimes” even made it into the script.\n\n(1:20:12)- What!?! Is this film really trying to tell me that there is no evidence of the germans systematically brutalizing prisoners of war in german custody? Is that a goddamn joke!?! There’s mountains of evidence for Soviet prisoners of war as well as Soviet civilians being placed, alongside Jews and other people that the Nazis considered sub-humans, in concentration camps. This movie is getting dangerously close to Holocaust denial. So far it’s been committing Holocaust denial by omission but now it’s almost straight up denying that the Holocaust ever happened.\n\n(1:20:41)- So now the film is saying that killing partisans and insurgents is ok as it doesn’t violate any international laws. This is directly contradicting what the film said earlier about the Polish army killing German partisans. The movie cannot condemn other nations for killing partisans while it defends germany’s killing of partisans. \n\n(1:21:23)- This movie needs to shut up about the Soviet Union “acting outside of the rules and norms established by the international community” until it finally admits that Germany was committing genocide against peoples it believed were sub-human.\n\n(1:26:26)- Commandos? Extermination campaign? Is the movie finally gonna mention Einsatzgruppen; the German military unit tasked with going into recently conquered Eastern European territory to kill any slavs with an education, priests, and Jews? No of course not! They’re talking about Stalin carrying out his scorched earth campaign.\n\n(1:33:17)- Ok so this movie just went into overdrive to somehow get from 1942 all the way to 1945 in less than a minute. I’m not saying that glossing over some of the most important events of World War II exposes this movie as a failure of a documentary on even the most basic level but glossing over some of the most important events of World War II exposes this movie as a failure of a documentary on even the most basic level.\n\n(1:34:01)-The film can complain all it wants about German prisoners of war being used as laborers but the fact of the matter is that many German prisoners found that the conditions in the prisoner camps in America were better than those they had had in Germany. The same cannot be said for Soviet prisoners taken by the Germans. Furthermore, despite the fact that many German prisoners were not repatriated until 1946, after the war had ended, this was due to evidence uncovered regarding the Holocaust and the victors feeling that German soldiers had to pay in some fashion for what their nation had done and what many of them had had a hand in perpetrating. German soldiers were also forced to watch documentaries on what happened at the concentration camps. Maybe the creator of this movie should check a few of those documentaries out since there are two minutes left of this movie and the Holocaust has not been mentioned once.\n\n(1:36:20)- This last Hitler quote is also idiotic if anyone actually buys it because Hitler definitely intended to make war. He laid out right in Mein Kampf that he wanted to secure more lebensraum for the Germans, so either he thought everyone would surrender to him immediately or he was intending on fighting wars the entire time. I’d stake my money on the latter since even Hitler couldn’t possibly be that stupid.\n\n\nAnd that is the end of this absolute garbage piece of media. This was just so difficult to watch, I apologize to any of you who watched this trash, I definitely regret not placing a warning on part one of this series regarding how bad this documentary really is. I’m honestly at a loss for words at how bad it truly was. There was just so much wrong with it. \nThe thing that I honestly found most disgusting in this whole movie was the blatant hypocrisy that was rampant throughout the whole thing. Whether it be calling Austro-fascism despotic while defending Hitler, or constantly claiming persecution and mistreatment of Germans (without sufficient evidence) while ignoring what the Germans were doing to civilians in the Holocaust. And on the subject of the Holocaust I cannot understand how this movie can reasonably call itself a Nazi Germany documentary while refusing to mention the Holocaust even once. This film doesn’t go as far as active Holocaust denial (which I’d categorize as actively stating that the Holocaust never happened) but it is definitely guilty of Holocaust denial by omission due to not once mentioning what was happening to Jews, Slavs, and other minorities under Hitler’s reign. \nThis film also had serious problems with its sources. It almost seems like they just read the titles of documents and never actually read them. Some documents don’t even say what the documentary says that they say! The quotes in this movie were also just dreadful. There was no citing where the quotes came from which meant I had a hell of a time finding out if they were real or not and what context they were said in. This last half hour in particular has a few timeline errors, where the film uses information that was unavailable during the time period to justify claims that the filmmakers are making. It’s things like these that make it abundantly clear that nobody working on this film was a historian.\nSo in conclusion I think this film is utter garbage and it holds absolutely no value as a documentary. The people who made this garbage should be ashamed of themselves and I honestly hope that at some point they rethink the decisions that they’ve made in life and reconsider their beliefs regarding World War II, Hitler, and the Holocaust.\n\n(Before I end this analysis I’d like to thank everyone who read this entire lengthy post, I really hope that you all enjoyed it! I’d also like to apologize to anyone who actually watched the documentary due to me linking it in this subreddit)\n\nSources- Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris by Ian Kershaw\n\n Hitler: 1936-1945 Nemesis by Ian Kershaw\n\nThe Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918-1933 by Sally Marks\n\nMunich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II by David Faber\n\nInside Europe by John Gunther\n\nGod’s Playground: A History of Poland by Norman Davies",

I remembered reading this article a while ago, so I set out to debunk it.\nInsinuating that the treaty of Versailles is unduly harsh is wrong. As noted by both my sources the treaty left Germany one of the strongest economic powers in the region and while the maximum size of their military was reduced the economic stipulations weren't very harsh. Adding to that, at Lausanne in 1932 the economic reparations were cut by a factor of 10 and the time in which Germany was to repay them was also increased. \nThis claim comes hand in hand that WW2 was directly caused by the stipulations the treaty of Versailles, when in fact many of the stipulations were not enforced or enforced lightly. And even the claim that the treaty of Versailles caused German nationalism isn't completely true as it must ignore the fact that right-wing nationalism rose after German Revolution. And while the treaty may have been a cause of the rise of nationalism seems like it is bad history to argue that history is a chain of political events in which one simply leads to another.\n\n2 supporting sources: \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25776836\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3hiukg/is_this_bad_history_of_the_treaty_of_versailles/\n\nRebuttal to 1st source \nhttp://noglory.org/index.php/articles/112-lions-and-donkeys-dan-snow-s-10-myths-about-world-war-one-answered-by-no-glory\n\nGerman Revolution \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319#Aftermath\n\nNote: This is my first write-up that I have posted so if there are any inaccuracies please correct me, I don't want to sound like a definitive source on this topic.\n",

Germany's military casualties were over 3,5 million.\n\nA research conducted by Rüdiger Overmans in 1999 showcases that the \"absolute losses\" during WW2 of Germany was **5.3 million** shown in [Table 6 (Tabelle 6), page 15.](https://dokst.de/main/sites/default/files/dateien/texte/Overmans.pdf)\n\n&gt;But JoJy, that seems pretty high, and \"absolute losses\" can also mean \"missing in action\", is there a more precise number?\n\nYes. We have information provided by *\"Statistisches Jahrbuch für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland; 1960\"*. [Table 3, page 78 (Tote der deutschen Wehrmacht im 2. Weltkrieg*)](http://www.digizeitschriften.de/download/PPN514402342_1960/PPN514402342_1960___log16.pdf) showcases deaths in the Wehrmacht being **4.4 million**.\n\n##Conclusion of point 1\nThe only conclusion I can come towards is the pie chart most likely uses an outdated source by accident which kinda makes Germany seem like an insane überarmee.\n\n# 2.  USSR's military deaths are a bit too high\n\nThe problem I have with the USSR's military deaths is that I can't really find one that cites 13 million military dead. Hell, even Wikipedia's maximum estimate is about 10 million military dead in the USSR if we go to the WW2 casualties article.\n\nHowever, according to *\"The Journal of Slavic Military Studies Volume 6 issue 4 1993 Bacon, Edwin - Soviet military losses in World War II\"*, estimate military losses in the USSR were [about 8.6 million](http://i.imgur.com/xOntGfz.png). And, again, [Wikipedia seems to show an estimate of 10 million dead, with 7 million being KIA/MIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II) ). \n\n##Conclusion of point 2\n\nIt seems the pie chart most likely takes into account POW deaths of USSR troops or something, I honestly can't tell you.\n\n#So is the German K/D just a meme?\n\nGermany did have less casualties than the USSR, but it seems like the information provided in the pie chart is incredibly absurd to imply that for every 1 German, 4-5 Ivans would be shot down or whatever. I'm fairly interested in casualties myself so feel free to correct me if I've messed anything up\n\n##Bonus point for anyone interested:\n\n[Here's statistics showcasing monthly losses of Germany during the start of Operation Barbarossa](http://i.imgur.com/hYAjvuJ.gif)",

Get ready because this section of the film is just the worst. In this section the movie finishes up on describing the prewar Europe and covers the early stages of WWII.\n\n(43:48)- So the film is basically saying that if the Poles had known that Germany was going to partition Poland between itself and the Soviet Union then they definitely would have agreed to allow Danzig to be annexed by Germany and somehow this is FDR’s fault instead of Germany, the country making claims on its neighbor’s borders, demanding the annexation of Danzig, and organizing secret plans to split Poland with the Soviets. Yep that is definitely America’s fault.\n\n(45:29)- Once again the movie states that it’s Poland’s fault that Germany invaded them because Poland didn’t give in to Germany’s threats. Yeah that makes tons of sense obviously the whole war is Poland’s fault because they didn’t want to cede one of the most important ports along the Baltic Sea to Germany.\n\n(46:24)- So now we’ve finally reached the German invasion of Poland and notably the film has left out the Gleiwitz incident, in which German agents disguised as Polish agents seized a broadcast station along the Polish-German border and played an anti-German radio message in Polish to make it look like the Poles had attacked the station. This false flag operation was then used as justification for the Nazi invasion of Poland.\n\n(47:50)-  I don’t understand how this film can constantly uses human rights violations of Germans in other countries as justification for Hitler’s aggressive actions while simultaneously ignoring the Holocaust which was happening throughout the entire course of the film inside of Germany. The funny thing is that I can’t find any substantive evidence of systematic persecution of Germans in Poland prior to WWII.\n\n(48:40)- Um I’m gonna need a citation on 1000 German civilians being murdered at Bromberg. The numbers I found were 254 German civilians killed (It’s also widely accepted that many of these were German insurgents who had attacked the Polish military) which is about a fourth of the number the film claims. Also the film leaves out the estimated 800 polish captives also shot at Bromberg by the Germans (maybe that’s where they’re getting their 1000 from?) and also the 3000 Poles Germany murdered at Bromberg as part of Operation Tannenberg as well as the 50 Polish prisoners of war falsely accused of taking part in the massacre who were summarily executed. Seems like the film needs to find a different account of what happened on Bloody Sunday and at the Valley of Death.\n\n(54:17)- The movie is phrasing the fact that 40,000 people died in the siege of Warsaw like it’s Poland’s fault because it didn’t surrender sooner to the invading German army. This is all sorts of wrong and messed up victim blaming.\n\n(54:59)- This movie cannot seriously be attempting to blame France and Britain for the continuation of the war that Hitler started. The peace offer they are discussing isn’t even a generous one. It’s literally that Germany will let some parts of Poland be independent again while Germany annexes Danzig as well as the entire Polish coastline. That’s not a generous peace deal and you can’t make the country who started the war look like the innocent party.\n\n(57:46)- So funnily enough I can’t really find any sources for Hitler’s attempts at negotiating peace with Britain and France other than one book written by Friedrich Stieve (which is where I suspect this film is getting its information from) who was literally a Nazi who was working for the government of the Third Reich so I feel like any claims he made in his book might be untrustworthy.\n\n(57:51)- So the film is phrasing this like Britain laying naval mines in Norwegian territorial waters was justification for the German invasion of Norway. This makes no sense since these events happened within one day of each other and I cannot find any credible sources that claim that the Nazis knew about Britain laying the minefield before they launched the invasion. \n\n(58:29)- Ok I guess Denmark is occupied now. The movie isn’t even gonna bring up that invasion or try to justify it, Denmark is just German now.\n\n(59:26)- Has the movie given up on its own premise of defending Hitler and the Nazis? It basically just admitted that Germany invaded neutral Belgium, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands without any attempt to justify or defend why Germany did it other than to attack France. It’s not really bad history it’s just weird for a documentary to abandon its core premise around the 60 minute mark. (I won’t complain though if this documentary stops trying to defend Hitler).\n\nThis concludes part three bringing us up to the one hour mark in this piece of garbage. I found this section to definitely be the toughest to make it through. I think it was weird how the movie basically began to stop trying to defend Hitler’s actions when that’s sort of the whole reason that they made the documentary. I’m not complaining since I don’t think that anyone should be trying to defend Hitler’s actions but I do have to wonder what was going through the heads of this film’s production staff. We still haven’t heard the word Jew or Holocaust mentioned at all which is still very concerning, but we still have one more part to go so maybe the film will pull a 180 in that last section and fix all its historical inaccuracies. It’s doubtful but we’ll find out tomorrow in the concluding segment.\n\nSources- Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris by Ian Kershaw\n\n Hitler: 1936-1945 Nemesis by Ian Kershaw\n\nThe Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918-1933 by Sally Marks\n\nMunich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II by David Faber\n\n\tInside Europe by John Gunther\n\n\tGod’s Playground: A History of Poland by Norman Davies",

        "text": "Link to Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6qy1ek/hitlers_war_what_neonazis_neglect_to_mention/\n\nLink to documentary being discussed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mA0kk29DBA&amp;t=3601s&amp;index=1&amp;list=WL\n\nWe resume our dissection of Hitler’s War: What Historians Neglect to Mention with the next 20 minute segment recounting further appeasement by the Allies and the buildup to WWII.\n\n(21:08)- The movie leaves out the parts where German paramilitary groups committed terroristic actions in the Sudetenland, how Hitler had created plans to invade Czechoslovakia if the Sudetenland was not ceded to Germany, how Czechoslovakia was not even invited to the Munich Conference where the Sudetenland was transferred to Germany, and how losing the Sudetenland cost Czechoslovakia most of its natural defences and defensive fortifications. But none of that matters as long as we see more video of smiling Germans waving at the camera!\n\n(25:01)- This documentary is ridiculous! How the heck can it possibly try to paint Poland as villainous for annexing regions of neighboring states while simultaneously defending Hitler’s annexation of regions of neighboring states!? You have to choose one or the other, you can’t do both!\n\n(26:01)- I’m gonna need this movie to fact check their claims that 95% of Danzig’s population was ethnically German. Estimates at the time range from Poles being 6% in 1929 but due to increased Polish immigration those estimates rise as high as 20% by the 1930’s. This isn’t that bad of history to be fair though since they were probably only looking for the estimates that would have the German population at its peak and 95% is pretty close to 94%.\n\n(29:59)- So now the movie is trying to portray Poland as desiring war with Germany and Germany only wanting peace. This is ludicrous as the German Foreign Minister had cited the Czechoslovakia Crisis as a failure due to the fact that he wasn’t able to give the German army a situation where they could test their skills in a real war. According to Lord Halifax, Hitler told him “If the slightest incident happens now, I shall crush the Poles without warning in such a way that no trace of Poland can be found afterwards. I shall strike with the full force of a mechanized army, of which the Poles have no conception.\" What part of that sounds like a nation that wants nothing but peace? Hitler had also mobilized German forces along the Polish border which isn’t what nations planning for peace usually do.\n\n(30:50)- So the film doesn’t actually provide a source for Winston Churchill saying that he wants the German economy to be completely smashed, and upon my own research I also cannot find a source for it and several sites claim that the quote is made up. This leads me to believe that the film is either lying to make a point (which isn’t uncharacteristic of neonazis) or they just did no research (which is also a common trait of neonazis).\n\n(32:23)- Somehow I’m finding a contradiction with the film saying “No threats toward Poland are made and not a single word of war is uttered” and Hitler saying “If the slightest incident happens now, I shall crush the Poles without warning in such a way that no trace of Poland can be found afterwards. I shall strike with the full force of a mechanized army, of which the Poles have no conception.\"\n\n(32:58)- Violence against Polish minorities!?! Those Poles sure are barbarians! It’s a good thing nothing like that happens in Germany! Once again movie you can’t vilify Poland for these things while defending Hitler! It’s one or the other not both! On a less sarcastic note, I cannot find any evidence for these claims that the movie is making about Polish aggression against German minorities.\n\n(35:14)-The Soviet Union was isolationist? What about the Westward Offensive and the Polish-Soviet War? Not exactly the actions of an isolationist country. \n\n(40:49)- Is the movie trying to suggest that WWII is the Soviet Union’s fault because it didn’t join France and the U.K. in a military alliance which would have deterred Germany from invading Poland thus causing WWII to never happen? That’s some funky logic they have going on there.\n\nThis wraps up part two of this series. This section’s discussion of the oppression of minorities really brought to my attention how little we’re hearing about the Holocaust or Jews in general in this documentary. I find it a little odd that we are now 40 minutes into a documentary about Hitler and Nazi Germany and we have not once heard the words Jew, Jewish, Concentration Camp, Final Solution or Holocaust. So keep that in mind moving forward in this documentary. I’ll be posting the next section tomorrow.\n\nSources: Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris by Ian Kershaw\n\n Hitler: 1936-1945 Nemesis by Ian Kershaw\n\nThe Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918-1933 by Sally Marks\n\nMunich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II by David Faber\n\nInside Europe by John Gunther\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6qy1ek/hitlers_war_what_neonazis_neglect_to_mention/",
        "text": "Hello fellow historians! Today I will be digging into one particularly egregious piece of bad history known as Hitler's War: What Historians Neglect to Mention. Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mA0kk29DBA&amp;list=WL&amp;index=1\n\nSo as a preface I figure I should provide a few bits of context. Hitler’s War: What Historians Neglect to Mention is an English translation of Alphart Geyer’s film Hitlers Krieg? Was Guido Knopp Verschweigt. The translation was done by Justice4Germans (Yeah that sounds legit). The original film is based on the book 1939 - Der Krieg, der viele Väter hatte (The War which had many Fathers) written by Gerd Schultze-Rhonhof. \n\tWith the proper people accredited I figure I should also put any and all biases I have out in the open to just for everyone to know where I’m coming from. I hate Nazis, I think they’re among the worst people to walk the face of this Earth and I think they were without a doubt the people who caused WWII. I think that the people behind this film are all either neonazis or Nazi sympathizers with the possible exception of Gerd Schultze-Rhonhof, who was born in 1939 and therefore qualifies as an actual Nazi rather than a neonazi. I randomly found this documentary a while ago while watching a different WWII documentary and was just in shock that this piece of garbage was allowed to exist. So without further adieu let’s take a look at Hitler’s War: What Historians Neglect to Mention.\n\n(2:58)- And here we have the subtitle of the movie “ What historians have neglected to tell us”. This subtitle implies a few things about historians that just aren’t true. It implies that they are one single organized group, it implies that they all have identical mindsets and opinions on history, and it implies that these historians have all agreed to work together to stop people from realizing that Hitler was innocent all along. All of these assumptions are obviously false and the movie is just trying to preemptively tell its audience to pay no heed to the historians who will find many faults in this movie because they’re just in on this vast anti-Nazi conspiracy.\n\n(4:19)- So this film decides to use a quote taken completely out of context from Sebastian Haffner to describe Germany at the time of the Nazi takeover. To be fair the film does accurately state that Haffner was a critic of the Third Reich but this is only so the movie can say “look, even Hitler’s critics thought him becoming chancellor was a good thing”. This quote from Haffner however is meaningless without it having been provided within adequate context, and that context is not provided so it’s difficult for a viewer to check what Haffner was trying to say with his quote about Germans having feelings of salvation.\n\n(4:46)- The health and well being of the ethnic German Middle class is what the film should be saying here since Nazis were most definitely not concerned about the health and well being of Jewish and other minorities who were members of the Middle class otherwise they wouldn’t have passed the Nuremberg laws and other legislation designed to limit their rights. Also the film leaves out that these four year plans that Hitler had were designed to make the military ready for war and this remilitarization cost so much that resources were diverted from Germany’s private sector which led to shortages among the general population. The film describes the four year plans as Goring was hoping they’d be rather than how they actually panned out.\n\n(5:27)- Social and economic boom for Germans should be stated here since those benefits were definitely not being felt by minorities who were having their property stolen and their rights stripped away. I’ll start sounding like a broken record if I point this out every time this movie talks about how Hitler was helping Germans without mentioning how he hurt German minorities at the same time so I’ll just state here that this film doesn’t adequately describe how non-German citizens of Germany were unable to enjoy the economic success of Germany during the Third Reich and leave it at that.\n\n(7:30)- The film is leaving out the part where after Saarland reunified with Germany Hitler went into the territory and arrested all the political dissidents that had taken refuge in the territory after the Nazi takeover. But that’s fine movie just keep showing those happy Germans waving at the camera, nothing wrong here!\n\n(9:08)- Umm excuse me movie but how does a mutual defense treaty between France and the Soviet Union nullify the treaty of Locarno which you just stated was to cement the new Western borders of Germany and guaranteed that the signatories would not attack each other. A mutual defense treaty is not an attack on Germany and it involved no territorial claims on Germany’s Western border so how the heck is that justification for Germany remilitarizing the Rhineland. You can’t say “they violated the Treaty of Locarno so we violated the Treaty of Versailles”. That’s not how treaties work and the French never violated the treaty of Locarno!\n\n(9:36)- So building on the previous point the film is talking about the Treaty of Locarno demilitarizing the Rhineland but the treaty of Locarno didn’t do that, the Treaty of Versailles did.\n\n(12:00)- The film is leaving out the parts of the Disarmament conference in Geneva where Germany was partially responsible for the talks breaking down due to their insistence that Germany be able to have the same size military as other League of Nations members despite the treaty of Versailles stating that they cannot.\n\n(12:44)- So know the film is trying to justify why it was okay for Germany to annex Austria and their argument is seriously that they were both in the Holy Roman Empire and were also both in the German Confederation. Both of these organizations were pretty loose when it came to union with the Holy Roman Empire encompassing a variety of states which were both German and non-German, and the German Confederation was even less of a political union than the Holy Roman Empire was.\n\n(13:38)- Oh the irony of a documentary defending Hitler calling Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss despotic. Oh wait but that’s probably just because unlike the film’s favorite dictatorial chancellor, Dollfuss banned the Austrian Nazi party due to their terroristic actions against the Austrian people.\n\n(14:00)- And the film just casually throws in that the Austrian Nazis murdered Dollfuss in an attempted coup and neglects to mention any possible links between those Austrian Nazis and another Austrian Nazi who happened to be chancellor of a neighboring nation.\n\n(15:03)- Does the documentary expect me to ignore the fact that Arthur Seyss-Inquart was literally only Austria’s Minister of Public Security because Hitler had threatened military action against Austria if they didn’t appoint Nazis to key government positions? Because I’m not going to ignore that. And on a side note, maybe the film should use someone else to talk about civil rights injustices that occurred during Austrofascism. Some possibly suggestions would be anyone who wasn’t found guilty of crimes against humanity during the Nuremberg Trials!\n\n(17:02)- Peaceful voluntary unification after Germany threatened to invade their nation. Yeah but other than threatening to use military force it was totally peaceful. Also the movie leaves out the part where Himmler and the SS went into Vienna before the rest of the army to arrest Jews and any political dissidents. \n\n(17:27)- Wow 99.7% voted for unification!? I’ve never seen anyone win a vote by that much! It’s almost as if Hitler and the Nazis rigged the vote to justify after the fact their illegal annexation of Austria and were trying to use falsified public support as an excuse for their illegal actions!\n\n(19:37)- It’s almost comical how the film tries to use the treaty of Saint-Germain to show how Czechoslovakia was unjust and violating the treaty, immediately after the film finishes the section on how Germany annexed Austria which was in violation of the treaty of Saint-Germain which forbid Austria from unifying with Germany.\n\nOkay that’s enough of this film for one day. I’ll revisit it at a later time to dissect another 20 minute chunk of this thing because if I did this in one post it would definitely be too long.If you enjoyed this just let me know and I’ll try my best to get the next section out as soon as possible I hope you’ll all join me again for the next installment of Hitler’s War: What Neonazis Neglect to Mention.\n\nSources: Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris by Ian Kershaw\n Hitler: 1936-1945 Nemesis by Ian Kershaw\nThe Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918-1933 by Sally Marks\nMunich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II by David Faber",

But that still doesn't give evidence that north africans looked sub-saharan african. Rome had provinces with sub-saharan africans, but they were in far south of Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\n&gt; But anyway, even if there were, there's no evidence that there was intermingling with the native population, as, black kids, to my knowledge aren't even part of british folklore.\n\nI'm sure most of us are aware of everyone's favourite English alt-right commentator's little incident on Twitter, and I'm sure most of us are aware of the alt-right's frothing at the mouth on this fine website.  Most of the points regarding non-white people in the Roman Empire, I feel, have been made already.  That's not what this post is about.  Rather, here we have a redditor talking about British folklore and the lack of black kids, and using that as proof that there was a lack of ethnic intermingling with the locals.\n\nSo there's a few ways one can take this.  Firstly, what exactly does he mean by \"British\"? Secondly, what the heck is \"British folklore\" and what does it constitute?  Finally, can whatever \"British folklore\" is tell us of the ethnic makeup of children in Roman Britain?\n\nSo, what's British?  In my mind, \"British\" has two meanings - either people of the island of Great Britain, encompassing modern-day Scotland, Wales and England; or, alternatively, it specifically refers to \"Celtic\" people living in Britain - the Britons.  Let's assume he means the latter, because that's obviously the most relevant.\n\nRome on the whole did not extensively settle Britain, and Roman influence is mostly felt in the south-eastern part of modern England and south-eastern Wales (where there's evidence of .  The former was extensively settled/conquered/assimilated into Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, who came after the Roman period, while the latter was not, maintaining Brittonic culture for centuries after the Anglo-Saxon settlement/conquest/genocide.  Areas under Anglo-Saxon control tended to adopt Anglo-Saxon customs, as evidenced by burials, as well as culture, ad evidenced by the English language.  So, for a large part of Britain, it is probably not conceivable that pre-Saxon folklore survived into the modern period.\n\nSo, then, let's consider \"British folklore\".  Thanks to our deduction, we can safely assume that British folklore is essentially Welsh folklore, and most importantly, early Welsh folklore.  It's the nature of folklore to not really last for centuries, much less preserve information about ethnic identity.  So, we'll be looking for stuff that's written down.\n\nAnd what Welsh stuff do we have that's written down?  We have prose stories, such as the *Four Branches*, as well as quite a bit of poetry.  There's quite a few things we can say about this evidence of British folklore.\n\nFirstly, dating.  Two of the oldest surviving Welsh texts are the *Gododdin*, composed by an \"Aneirin\", and the poetry of Taliesin; together they constitute the genre of \"Epic\" poetry.  They claim to be from the sixth century, about post-Roman cultures and events, but there's a lot of debate about it.  This claim is most likely faulty due to things like language and the actual content, and they are more likely from at least the ninth century - at least four hundred years after the end of Roman Britain!  Can such late texts really contain genuine folklore from the Roman period?\n\nSecondly, content.  The stuff that we have tends not to be about Roman Britain or anything like that, unless it's incredibly twisted (some have said that the Coranaiaid in *Lludd and Llefelys* are Romans, but it's a weird depiction of Romans if they are indeed Romans, because they're guys who can hear everything on the island of Britain).  Also, a lot of this stuff was first written down several centuries after the end of Roman Britain.  Furthermore, the earliest stuff we have like the *Gododdin* is light on description of physical appearance, so I don't think you can draw any concusions based on the content of this stuff either.  \n\nAnd finally, intent.  The stuff we have is written (because expecting verbal transmission of stories from like 300 AD is a little bit much).  They were written by monks, who could read and write, unlike most of the unwashed masses in Britain.  The obvious implication here is that what we have is not necessarily representative of what the average Briton, who may have had contact with non-white people, actually experienced (and the passage of time probably distorted recollections of this experience anyway).\n\nSo, in conclusion - it's an absoutely ridiculous claim to suggest that black kids should appear in British folklore in order to prove that non-white people were around in Roman Britain.  Considering that the earliest representations of stuff that may/may not be folklore are so far removed from Roman Britain, whatever Romano-British folklore included is definitely lost.\n\nSources:\n\n* T.

In 1945, he was the first to calculate, in a four-page, hand-typed memorandum, the location above Earth's surface where a satellite's period exactly matches the 24-hour rotation period of Earth. \n\nWhich is wrong. The altitude was known at least from the 1920s. From [Basics of Geostationary Orbit](https://celestrak.com/columns/v04n07/):\n\n&gt;The concept of the geostationary orbit has been around since the early part of the twentieth century. Apparently, the concept was originated by Russian theorist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky—who wrote numerous science and science-fiction articles on space travel at the turn of the century. In the 1920s, Hermann Oberth and Herman Potocnik—perhaps better known by his pseudonym, Herman Noordung—wrote about space stations which maintained a unique vantage over the earth.1 Each author described an orbit at an altitude of 35,900 kilometers whose period exactly matched the earth's rotational period, making it appear to hover over a fixed point on the earth's equator.\n\nTsiolkovsky and Oberth are well known, but not for being the first calculating the altitude of geosynchronous orbit. Calculating altitude of GSO is not a particularly noteworthy accomplishment. It might have even been done earlier than Tsiolkovsky.\n\nClarke's accomplishment was suggesting communication satellites be placed in geosynchronous orbit. This idea was a huge game changer. It pushed the boundaries of human economic activity to 36,000 kilometers above earth's surface. It spawned a communication satellite industry worth hundreds of billions.\n\n",

I.E.: Nazis being portrayed as right wing.\"\n\nWell let's examine exactly how stupid this is. Many uneducated/willfully ignorant people think that because the full name of the Nazi Party is the National Socialist Party, they were Socialists. They were not, they were on the opposite end of the political spectrum and in fact were openly hostile towards Socialists and Communists. Similar to how the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is in no way democratic. \n\n\n- Conflict with and hatred of the Left Wing\n\nOn June 30th, 1934, a purge occurred in the Nazi Party during which the left wing of the party, the Strasserists, were murdered. This purge also included Brownshirt leaders and others who may have posed a threat to Hitler's power. [This was known as the Night of the Long Knives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives). After this the Nazi Party continued to be [completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism#Anti-communism) [anti-communist](https://www.thoughtco.com/was-adolf-hitler-a-socialist-1221367). The entire ideology of Nazism was based on race, while Socialism and Communism are entirely class-based. Adolf Hitler was even quoted as saying \"I absolutely insist on protecting private property ... we must encourage private initiative.\"\n\nThe first concentration camps were opened in 1933 and intended for imprisonment of political opponents. The first of these opponents were [Social Democrats and Communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust#Nazi_Germany)\n\n- Hitler's Economics\n\nIn addition, he also said \"The basic feature of our economic theory is that we have no theory at all.\" Which is at complete odds with the entirely-economic ideology of Communism.\n\n\nNazism is [a far-right political ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism). \"The term \"National Socialism\" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of \"socialism\", as an alternative to both international socialism and free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the Marxist concept of class conflict, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the \"common good\" and accept political interests as the main priority of economic organization.\"- Christopher Kobrak.\n\n",

        "text": "Summarized by the quote; there seems to be a belief that if you captured a ruler you could demand anything and expect to get it, after all:\n\n\n&gt;It's not capturing castle that matters, but capturing a king.\n \n\nThis misunderstanding is even more prominent in games like Crusader Kings II where capturing a war leader gives you 100% warcore thus ending the war.\n\n\nBut in reality unless you were also able to get the heir **apparent** (or anyone who could become the heir apparent) it didn't really have that big of an impact. Sure, you would get a hefty ransom out of it and perhaps part of the ransom could be paid in territorial concessions.\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n\n[1071](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1071): [Basileus Romanós IV ton Rhōmaiōn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanos_IV_Diogenes) was captured by [Alp Arslan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alp_Arslan). He was released with a promise of ransom. Not only did Romanós have two non-disinherited sons, but his stepson served as symbasileis.\n\n\n[1141](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1141): [Rei Estevienne des Engleis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen,_King_of_England) was captured by [Dame Mathilde des Engleis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Matilda), [la werre ceville engleise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy) however did not end and Estevienne was soon exchanged. While in captivity two of his sons were free.\n\n\n[1174](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1174): [Righ Uilleam I na h-Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Lion) was captured the forces of [Rei Henri II des Engleis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) and therefore agreed to sign a humiliating peace treaty. Uilleam had no heir apparent, in fact he had no children, only a brother as heir presumptive.\n\n\n[1192](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1192): [Richard Cuerde Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England) was captured by [Leopold der Tugendhafte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_V,_Duke_of_Austria). As we know he was later ransomed and never had any legitimate offspring.\n\n\n[1356](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1356): [Rei Jean II de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_France) was captured by [le Prince Noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward,_the_Black_Prince), but the fighting continued until 1360 when he was ransomed in a compromised peace treaty. Note that the treaty didn't release Jean, but included a section about how his ransoming should be handled. Although his youngest son accompanied him in captivity he had three others sons.\n\n\n[1449](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1449): [Zhèngông Huángdì](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yingzong_of_Ming) was captured by [Esen Taishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esen_Taishi). Zhèngtông did have a heir apparent, however he was replaced by his brother, thus he was released without a ransom.\n\n\n[1465](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1465): [King Henry VI of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England) was captured by [King Edward IV of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England), but fighting continued... Henry had a free son. Even when Edward was forced to flee London in 1470 in he didn't bother to dispose Henry. In the following year Henry's only child was slain, while he himself was recaptured and followed his son only 17 days later.\n\n\n\nOnly case which included concession, ransom and subjugation was that of Uilleam, brought to him by his dire situation. I would argue that if Richard had been captured by Philippe Auguste or Uilleam similar outcome had occurred.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I don't know how accurate my statement is for the Early Modern Period and after, but I'm confident that it was the case before. \n\n\nEdit I: Fixed formatting.\n\n\nEdit II: Added Wikipedia hyperlinks for your convenience.",

        "text": "Strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a long and wild ride.\n\nI recently discovered Graham Hancock from my YouTube suggestions, an unfortunate result of watching academic lectures and Alex Jones remix compilations. While he has been discussed here before, it’s been a long time since someone’s gone fully into the crazy. This post is my attempt at making sense of a man who, despite being well-travelled, well-read, and eloquent, is perhaps the most dogged pseudohistorian in existence. \n\nI’ll be taking a look at two sources. In this post, I’ll be examining [this lecture]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VUmtCLePL8), and in Part 2, I’ll go over [this blog post]( https://grahamhancock.com/hancockg17/), which demonstrates how Hancock can hide his crazy in a well sourced, seemingly well researched article. \n\nI’ll try to limit the extent to which I fell into this rabbit hole, but be warned – there is no bedrock to the crazy. Braver souls than I have ventured here and gotten lost between his arguments for the erosion of the Sphinx and his theory on ancient maps pointing to Antarctica, never to be found again. You’ve been warned.\n\n**Defining Pseudohistory**\n\nBefore proceeding into the realm of Graham Hancock, I wish to define a few terms. On pseudohistory, I’m using the same criteria and definition as the [Skeptic’s Guide]( http://www.skepdic.com/pseudohs.html). Second, to elaborate on “professional,” I mean someone who has dedicated their livelihood to writing and publishing works on history and with a captive audience, distinguishing Hancock from your average Wehraboo on /r/history. Follows of the sub know about our favorites; we've got the stubbornly misguided (Jared Diamond), the disingenuous (Samuel Huntington), tinpot theorists (Gavin Menzies), agenda-pushers (Grover Furr), conspiracy theorists (from JFK theorists to David Icke and beyond), and at some point we cross the threshold into pure insanity and the distinction no longer matters. \n\nGraham Hancock falls fully into the tinpot theorist category due to his dogged pursuit of proving his multitude of theories, despite all evidence against them. Additionally, he’s been a pseudohistorian for a long, long time. According to his [Amazon biography]( https://www.amazon.com/Graham-Hancock/e/B004561L0S), Hancock first discovered the wonderful world of pseudoarcheology in the early 1980s during a trip to Ethiopia, which led him to hunt for the Ark of the Convenant. You can read the rest of the biography to get a good sense of what we’re dealing with.\n\n**The Lecture**\n\nHancock’s body of work is enormous, and all of it is crazy. While I could tear into _Fingerprints of the Gods_, [others in the field have done it far better than I ever could.]( https://badarchaeology.wordpress.com/2013/12/29/graham-hancock-and-the-lost-civilisation/) Instead, I’ve chosen this lecture because it demonstrates his craziness in an easily digested format that doesn’t required digging through one of his books. Get out your conspiracy bingo cards and prepare your livers, everyone, as I present [The Advanced Pre Ice Age Civilizations that Vanished From Earth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VUmtCLePL8)\n\n**Introduction**\n\n0:00 – It’s unrelated to Hancock, but it’s always nice to see a shitty intro like this. Speaks volumes for the channel.\n\n2:02-2:55 – In this section, Hancock outlines _why_ his work is important. Hancock describes humanity as a “species with amnesia,” then goes on to say that society ensures that we don’t question the past, because society is meant to keep people asleep and away from asking questions. Hancock then follows this bit of conspiratorial horseshit by saying that study for the past is liberating for the present, stating a reason why I went into history. Goddammit.\n\n**The Ice Age**\n\n3:55 – Hancock describes the glaciation during the last Ice Age, stating, “any traces of anything underneath it were ground to dust by the weight of that ice.”\n\n4:57 – Hancock lays more groundwork by focusing on how much land was lost by the sea level rise – “as much as Europe and China put together.” I could be pedantic and ask for his definition of China, but if I took that approach, we’d be here all day.\n\n6:06 – Description of catastrophic failures of glaciers that rose the sea level overnight, which leads to…\n\n6:25 – flood myths! Here Hancock says that he disagrees with academia’s belief that the flood myths come from local floods. Another tangent that I won’t go down.\n\n7:01 – Atlantis! (Take a shot.) Hancock’s argument here is that if Atlantis is just made up, why did Plato choose a date around 12,000 years ago? \n\n10:21 – Hancock pushes for the flood myths in the Middle East by describing the rapid flooding of the Persian Gulf. \n \n**The Mystery of the Maps**\n\n11:11 – Now we move onto the first of Hancock’s truly insane topics, his obsession with old maps. This topic [has been covered on here before]( https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2x6qjq/500yearold_map_supposedly_shatters_the_official/), but I’ll take a stab at a few of his claims.\n\n12:05 – Hancock describes how the maps that we have from the 13th through 17th Centuries drew on older maps that have been lost. I think you can see where he’s going with this.\n\n12:17 – “And these ancient maps seem to record the world as it appeared fifteen, twenty thousand years ago.” Hooooo boy, here we go. Hancock's claim hinges on the idea that there was a powerful civilization that mapped the world millennia ago. Even if we get over this _massive_ leap in logic, consider the claim.  His argument is that the maps of this civilization survived the Ice Age, persisted through the Neolithic, and were only lost *now* when they were replaced by more accurate maps during the Age of Exploration. \n\n13:23 – Ptolemy was also drawing on older maps, so goes Hancock’s argument. Older maps that, again, must have come down from the Ice Age.\n\n14:48 – Hancock claims that accurate longitudes only appeared in Western maps in the 18th Century, while the maps from the ancient world had accurate longitude measurements. Here we see the popular tactic of presenting only two choices – either accurate longitudes on the maps were made by sheer guesswork, which is preposterous, or they were the result of maps being passed down since before the Ice Age. Hancock forgets that there is a wonderful tool used by cartographers for centuries known as [Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation).\n\n15:00 – Charles Hapgood is the “best source on this material,” which is to say, the _only_ source. Hancock picked Hapgood's work and ran with it, no questions asked, and with Hapgood, [there are _plenty_ of questions to ask.](http://www.skrause.org/writing/papers/hapgood_and_ecd.shtml)\n\n16:00 – Here we are, the introduction of Antarctica. Take a good long drink, ladies and gentlemen, because this is not the last you’ll be hearing of this continent. Here, Hancock shows us an image of a map from the 16th Century, where Antarctica is shown as part of South America. His claim is that Antarctica, undiscovered until the 19th Century, still appears on all these old maps. Why? Is it because of errors, like showing California as an island or other phantom landmasses? Is it because of guesswork and speculation on the part of earlier cartographers? Is it a misidentification of Australia? No, of course it isn't, argues Hancock, it's clearly because the pre-Ice Age civilization mapped it out and passed their knowledge down throughout history. And I'm not putting words in his mouth, because a minute later he states the following: “Is it possible that those source maps may go back to an earlier civilization? One that had the technology to map the entire globe?”\n\n17:55 – Hancock now compares the depiction of Southeast Asia in a Ptolemaic map to the lost continent of Sundaland. This is absurd on a number of levels, but let’s just debunk it using the same logic that Hancock is trying to apply here.\n\n[This]( http://imgur.com/gallery/rxzvZ) is the part of the map that he’s describing. [This]( http://i.imgur.com/ofZoezR.png) is the Malay Peninsula. [This]( https://atlantisjavasea.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/sundaland-last-glacial-maximum_75.png) is Sundaland. I don’t know, you tell me, what does the map resemble the most? Again, I’m just asking questions. \n\n19:09 – Hancock now discusses the Isle of Brasil, a mythical island off the coast of Ireland. He then states that there exists an undersea bank close to the area that was exposed during the Ice Age. Only problem is, the bank is too deep. According to [this survey]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17445647.2015.1099573), the bank is 145 meters under at its absolute tallest, as contrasted with the [sea level rise of 120 meters]( https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/gornitz_09/). But remember kids, in pseudohistory, if something _kindasortanotreally_ fits and supports your worldview, then it must be true!\n\n19:45 – Hancock cites the island of Bimini as further evidence of his lost civilization. [Take another shot.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimini_Road) \n\nAt this point, I’d like to quote one of the best Hancock debunks I found, courtesy of [the badarcheology website.]( https://badarchaeology.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/hancocks-fingerprints-of-the-gods-part-i-misunderstanding-early-modern-cartography/) The conclusion sums it up far better than I:\n\n&gt;We are faced with an inexcusable ignorance about how to conduct adequate research into the past, a naïve belief that it is possible to rely on only one interpretation of the evidence, a failure to establish an hypothesis by showing how his own explains the data better than existing hypotheses or a deliberate suppression of evidence that undermines his hypothesis…the result is that Part I of Hancock’s book is not a scholarly examination of early modern maps, but one that is tendentious while trying to give the impression of scholarship to an unsuspecting readership who he hopes will see the work as well researched because of all those footnotes.\n\n**The Egyptians**\n\n20:20 – At this point in the video, we enter the longest and most tired section, where Hancock builds up his arguments around Ancient Egypt, the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and more. I readily admit I’m not an expert on Ancient Egypt, and given the amount of work written debunking Ancient Egyptian New Age bullshit, others have said it better than I can. As such, links are done as necessary.\n\n20:30 – Pyramid woo. Drink. \n\n23:29 – Greater antiquity of the Pyramids, i.e. they’re over 10,000 years old. Hancock prefaces this by stating that no matter how angry the archeologists become, “no matter how they swarm out of their nest over anybody who dares to criticize the existing paradigm,” truth seekers like him will keep bringing it up. Take *another* shot.\n\n27:50 – [Rainfall erosion of the Sphinx,]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_water_erosion_hypothesis) with the added claim that this means that it dates back to the Ice Age.\n\n29:34 – The Pyramids over Giza, [“that atmosphere of strangeness and mystery cannot be escaped.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)\n\n32:00-40:36 – Gawking over the design of the pyramid. At least he doesn’t say that it couldn’t have been built by human hands.\n\n40:41 – the “ONLY” evidence that Egyptologists cite to link the Pyramid to Pharaoh Khufu. \n\n44:55 – At this point Hancock says the most reprehensible thing in the entire video. Hancock begins by saying that the Ancient Egyptians cared far more about death than our society does. From there he says, the following.\n\n&gt; The Ancient Egyptians put their best minds to work for 3,000 years on considering the mystery of death and what we may or may not confront when we die. And when it comes to these matters, I'd rather listen to the Ancient Egyptians than any bloody modern scientist. Because the modern scientists are pygmies, you know! They're infants, they're children! They may be able to weigh, measure, and count brilliantly, but they know nothing of matters of the spirit. We need to turn to civilizations like Ancient Egypt, the Ancient Maya, and to surviving shamanistic cultures around the world to understand, really, the mysteries of life and death. \n\nThis is the most pure distillation of Hancock's problems with modern society and why he is such a dedicated and deluded pseudohistorian. To Hancock, the issue isn't just a conspiracy to keep people asleep, it's a problem with how _everyone else_ in the modern world carries out their lives. Furthermore, ancient civilizations aren't meant to be studied to learn about how they existed, they're to be studied to fill out his worldview.

Here, Hancock posts perhaps the most wondrously _stupid_ thing yet: [this map.](http://i.imgur.com/5I0WeZn.png) He uses it to claim that there are a number of notable historic sites on various different longitudes. Usually, Hancock’s dishonesty and stupidity take a little more time to parse out, but here, it’s just too easy. This has gotten fairly tedious, so let’s have some fun.\n\nGraham, I propose an experiment. Take a map of the globe and pick any seven lines of longitude. Let’s make it nice and complicated and take a set of seven digits in the Fibonacci sequence, with east and west alternating based on if the number is even or odd. We get 8°E, 13°W, 21°W, 34°E, 55°W, 89°W, and 144°E. Put them on a map and search for some civilizations and you get:\n\n* 8°E – Carthage\n\n* 13°W – Ghana Empire\n \n* 21°W – Icelandic Commonwealth\n \n* 34°E – Cappadocia \n \n* 55°W – Newfoundland\n \n* 89°W – The Mayans\n \n* 144°E – Hokkaido\n\nWhat’s this? Why, it seems that the Phoenicians of Carthage and the Ainu of Hokkaido both knew about the Fibonacci Sequence, why else would there be people there? And you’ve got the Mayans too, and we all know how much they knew about astronomy and _matters of the spirit_! Judging from this set of data, I’m going to publish a theory that the Norse settlers of Iceland discovered Newfoundland because of their knowledge of the Fibonacci Sequence, and if academia rejects my idea, that’s because I've made an effort to actually _remember_ the past, unlike those myopic ivory tower dwellers!\n\n1:08:45 – “Angkor, or Ankh Hor,” means “life to Horus” but that’s just a coincidence according to those pesky scholars!\n\n1:11:17 – Hancock claims that the various structures around Angkor, including “pyramid-like hills,” trace the constellation of Draco, which only appears in the northern hemisphere. And this correlation could _only_ appear in the year 10,500BC. But before you get out your pitchforks, Hancock says it’s okay, because the current temples of Angkor are built atop _earlier_ temples.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt the conclusion, we come to the meat of why Hancock is such a dedicated pseudohistorian, which is to say, why all conspiracy theorists write the way that they do – because _he has the truth,_ and _you're a blind slave to society_. Let's proceed.\n\n1:11:53 – Hancock ties it all together, and explains that because we “are a species with amnesia,” that maybe when we tie everything together, some of that existential dread that all of us feel may be lessened with this truth.\n\n1:13:11 – “In the modern world, sadly, few such mysteries concern us.” Hancock then shows off a few clips of pop culture and financial documents to show how *degenerate* our civilization has become. \n\n1:14:18 – Hedonism and consumption, he argues, rule the day, because we have severed ties with our spiritual side. How does he know this? Because this is what shamans in the Amazon told him on an expedition. He caps this off with a rant at the destruction of the rainforest.\n\n1:16:37 – Hancock closes with a prophecy from the [Hermetica.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica) He notes the similarity between this prophecy and one from the Maya, and reads the passage as yet another example of the Wisdom of the Ancients™. If you still have a square open on your bingo card, mark it.\n\n1:22:00 – Hancock makes a reference to 2012, saying that he is “unsure” if there will a catastrophe. If you still have any alcohol left, drink it.\n\nJoin me next time where I'll take apart the blog post. In the meantime, I'm going to go back to /r/shitwehraboossay for some easily-debunked levity.\n",

        "title": "Bad Martial Arts history: Taekwondo, the martial art of peasant suppression.",
        "author": "HumanMilkshake",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6pfd26/bad_martial_arts_history_taekwondo_the_martial/",
        "text": "Alternate title: Communism is not an appropriate lens to use to judge the reasoning for the development of martial arts\n\nSomewhat recently there was [a post where I got to flex my small-but-mighty knowledge of martial arts history](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5zko8a/bad_romanorajput_history_or_how_byzantinebasileus/df1b7su), which is one of the only areas I could honestly be said to be an expert. Wanting to contribute to the subreddit, I decided to see what I could do about posting some interesting martial arts history.... and promptly came up with nothing for four months. See, there's fairly little that could really be called \"bad history\". There are plenty of styles with somewhat mythological origins that make it difficult to figure out the style's origins (Wing Chun somewhat famously has about a dozen wildly conflicting origins), or to separate what is true from what is a myth (how much of Northern Pray Mantis kung fu is based on the movements of a mantis?). But there's very little real \"bad history\". \n\nAnd then I remembered [this](https://www.revleft.space/vb/threads/148351-Martial-arts?p=2032649#post2032649).\n\nThe relevant portion is the line:\n\n&gt; I just can't abide an art that was originally designed so that Korean noblemen could kick the shit out of peasants without soiling their hands... Hence the 5 million variety of kicks and lack of emphasis punching or grappling techniques.\n\nNow that comment was specifically referring to the Korean martial arts style Taekwondo. This comment has a number of issues.\n\n**But first: History!**\n\nKorea and Japan have never had the best relationship, what with Japan's multiple attempts at conquering Korea. In 1910 Japan formally annexed Korea. For various reasons Korean martial arts were experiencing a dip in popularity at the time and during the occupation were largely displaced by Japanese Judo and Aikido and Okinawan Shotokan karate. After WWII when Korea became an independent country (more or less) a number of the students of these Japanese and Okinawan martial arts started their own schools replacing the Japanese names for strikes and movements with Korean ones. Some stuff happened (it's complicated) and the most prominent of these masters developed what we know as Taekwondo in an attempt to unify the new Korean martial arts. Some other stuff happened (it's complicated) and in Korea they're mostly unified under the Kukkiwon and the Korean Taekwondo Association (KTA), but outside of Korea there are dozens of conflicting organizations. The most important TKD organization is the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) which administers TKD in the Olympics.\n\n**Problem the First: TKD != Taekkyeon**\n\nMany TKD students today like to claim that TKD was built primarily on the pre-Japanese style of Taekkyeon, which was one of those styles that was falling out of favor during the occupation. I think a lot of that has to do with, well, the war. Since TKD was founded in the 1950s, when Korea had no nobility, his phrasing strongly suggests that he is taking the position that Taekkyeon is the source of TKD, and therefore whatever moral failings Taekkyeon has is something that TKD has to take blame for. But notice how in my above paragraph I didn't once mention Taekkyeon? Right, that's because the two are mostly unrelated. \n\nThe Korean schools that merged to become TKD are called [The Five Kwans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwan_(martial_arts/)), and while Won Kuk Lee and Hwang Kee both studied Taekkyeon, four of the five based their teachings on Karate, and the fifth (Yoon Byung-in) did not know Taekkyeon. Furthermore, [here is a video of Taekkyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga1Im-3ZtH8), and [here's one of TKD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPVuC6ugmAw). Notice how they look almost exactly nothing alike? Taekkyeon is more flowy, loopy, and they use their hands to defend themselves and strike, while TKD is aggressive, linear, and goes for powerful kicks. Did you noticed that TKD guys tend to not even really, like, defend, just going straight for the knock out? [Now watch this video of Kyokushin Karate guys knocking each other out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUEw2RoWkSM). Notice how they're very linear, aggressive, and go straight for the knock out, not even really bothering to defend themselves? \n\nAlso, if you go to the wikipedia article for Taekwondo, [it says that TKD is mostly based on Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo), so I win.\n\n**Problem the Second: That's not how that works**\n\nThe literal reason why modern TKD has so much emphasis on kicking is complex. The rules of WTF-style TKD definitely emphasize kicks (punches only earn you one point and you can only hit the chest piece, but a kick can hit anywhere above the belt and can get up to three points). The more time you spend reading about the topic the more explanations you'll see, but none of them have anything to do with Taekkyeon being about noble warriors beating up peasants. I've heard it's because you're more likely to knock someone out with a kick so the rules emphasize this, a Buddhist inspired Korean belief in not dirtying your hands with war, it was meant to distinguish TKD from Boxing as much as possible so it would be more likely to get into the Olympics, and a dozen others. I don't know, and there's probably no single answer anyways. \n\nIn the video I posted of Kyokushin fighters knocking each other out, did you notice how most of the knockouts were done by kicks? You will find a lot of \"knock out by kick\" in Muay Thai and kickboxing too, which I cannot help but think is probably a natural trend. Anytime you're going for a knock out, it seems like you would benefit from a strike that involves using some of the strongest muscles in your body.\n\nBut here's the thing: just because there's no conclusive reason for a thing, doesn't mean you can just project an explanation based on your ideology with no evidence. \n\n**Lightning Round**\n\n* The guy suggests that Taekkyeon has a huge emphasis on kicking so Korean nobles wouldn't get their hands dirty kicking peasants. Taekkyeon does not have a huge emphasis on kicking, as demonstrated earlier in videos\n* Also, Taekkyeon was founded (as far as I can tell) sometime in the late Joseon dynasty, which did not have any kind of warrior noble to the best my knowledge.\n* Why does he think the major role a warrior noble is beating up peasants? Like, he doesn't say \"kill peasants\", he says \"kick the shit out of\". Does he think Korea was such an awful country that there was enough peasant revolts to necessitate the development of a martial art *just* to beat up peasants?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6owzax/bad_history_of_writing_guns_germs_and_steel_chp/",
        "text": "I realise that hating on *Guns, Germs and Steel* is not exactly new in r/badhistory, but I figured I'd focus on a chapter I haven't seen before. This chapter is particularly important to criticise, because Diamond essentially uses the study of writing systems as a substitute for any consideration of cultural histories. It is also a sterling example of his cherry-picking and appeals to \"common sense\" that do not, on closer examination, *make* sense.\n\nLet's start with his introduction. Diamond claims that \"knowledge brings power\", and therefore writing, along with \"weapons, microbes and centralized political organization\" is a \"modern agent of conquest\". The key questions he asks here are:\n\n* \"Why, then, did only some peoples and not others develop writing, given\nits overwhelming value?\"\n* \"Of those peoples who did develop it, why did some do so much earlier than others?\"\n* \"Did writing systems spread by being copied, or did existing systems merely inspire neighboring peoples to invent their own systems?\"\n* (for funsies) \"For instance, today almost all Japanese and Scandinavians are literate but most Iraqis are not: why did writing nevertheless arise nearly four thousand years earlier in Iraq?\" ^1\n\nAnd then he tips his hand when he says,\n\n&gt; Similar questions arise whenever one tries to understand the origins and spread of many other aspects of human culture—such as technology, religion, and food production... We shall therefore trace writing's development not only because of its inherent importance, but also for the general insights into cultural history that it provides.\n\n^1 He also shows a stunning lack of knowledge about modern social conditions that might lead to lowered literacy rates, but that's practically to be expected.\n\nDiamond goes on to split up writing systems into three: alphabets, logographies, and syllabaries. As a side note, he says Japanese's \"predominant writing system\" is logographic \"kanji\", with an additional syllabary system, \"kana\". In reality, Japanese uses both together, and calling kanji its \"predominant writing system\" makes no sense.\n\nHe then goes into a relatively standard history of the development of Sumerian writing systems: that they started off as pictograms, then eventually became a logographic-phonetic mix.\n\nDiamond then asserts that, via what he calls \"blueprint copying\", speakers of different languages took that basic idea of Sumerian cuneiform and adapted them for their own languages, starting with early Semitic \"experiments\" in representing vowels with diacritics, taking a detour into the Greek deployment of \"co-opting\" letters for vowels, and ends with \n\n&gt; the line [of writing system development] most familiar to European and American readers is the one that led via the Phoenicians to the Greeks by the early eighth century B.C., thence to the Etruscans in the same century, and in the next century to the Romans, whose alphabet with slight modifications is the one used to print this book. **Thanks to their potential advantage of combining precision with simplicity, alphabets have now been adopted in most areas of the modern world.**\n\n(emphasis mine) *Personally*, I'd have amended the start of sentence as: \"Thanks to their backing by imperialism and cultural genocide...\"\n\nAlso, aren't there large swaths of the world that still use logograms and syllabaries, like, I don't know, China or Japan?\n\nHere's the thing: the job of a writing system is to represent a spoken language. That's it. If it can do that, it's accomplished its job. There is nothing about alphabets that makes them the most efficient system. Some languages are more suited to some writing systems as a function of their linguistic features. To claim that alphabets are the most precise and most simple is to completely miss the point.\n\nDiamond then falls over himself to show examples of people taking the \"blueprint\" of the alphabet and re-applying it. He tells the story of the developments of Cherokee syllabary, and of Hangul, and then back-applies it to Egyptian hieroglyphs. He spares one paragraph to talk about Chinese characters' independent invention, making him sound more baffled by its existence than anything, then promptly ignores it (and Mayan writing, to which he devoted *two* paragraphs) for the rest of the chapter.\n\nThen, using the sound logical basis of \"I think so, therefore it was,\" he asserts that it would just have been too hard for Egypt and China to have independently developed writing.\n\n&gt; It would be a remarkable coincidence if, after millions of years of human existence without writing, all those Mediterranean and Near Eastern societies had just happened to hit independently on the idea of writing within a few centuries of each other. Hence a possible interpretation seems to me idea diffusion... That is, Egyptians and other peoples may have learned from Sumerians about the idea of writing and possibly about some of the principles, and then devised other principles and all the specific forms of the letters for themselves.\n\nThere's also [this diagram](https://i.imgur.com/DYcwxq6.png). Note the question marks next to China and Egypt.\n\nHe rounds out his chapter by saying that Sumer, Mexico and China, his three places of independent writing system invention, were home to large centralized political systems, which have a \"necessary relation to food production\". He ends by saying that \"The history of writing illustrates strikingly the similar ways in which geography and ecology influenced the spread of human inventions.\"\n\nWell, maybe in Diamond-land it does. As with most of his work, the problem is not necessarily with the evidence he presents. It's with the huge, gaping holes in the work. It's in what he never asks and conveniently forgets to show us. And, therefore, it's in the conclusions he draws with this incredibly selective presentation of evidence.\n\nLet's summarize his narrative:\n\n* Writing is independently developed in a handful of areas—Mexico, Sumer and China...\n\t* because all of them are hubs of centralized political power and early food production (except he doesn't know when major food production started in Mexico, so he ignores it)\n\t* and they all use it for religion, bureaucracy, state propaganda, or some combination of the above.\n* These early writing systems, or at least the idea of writing, spread to their neighbours, apparently through sheer proximity.\n* These writing systems simplify as writing moves into wider, private usage.\n\nAnd here are some notes, before we really dig in:\n\n* The earliest examples of poetry, comedy, or any other non-utilitarian use of writing Diamond provides is Greco-Roman: \"Greek alphabetic writing from the moment of its appearance was a vehicle of poetry and humor, to be read in private homes.\" Way to not be Eurocentric!\n* He makes no distinction between different *types* of alphabets: as far as he's concerned, abjads, abugidas and alphabets are all the same, merely variations on the core of Sumerian cuneiform.\n\nNow, here are the irritating questions Diamond never bothered asking!\n\n###Was there literally anyone else who adopted writing outside of his narrative?\n\nIn Diamond's world, there's only one path to developing writing, in that you must be a centralized political state with surplus food production i.e. agricultural. \n\n&gt; Writing was never developed or even adopted by hunter-gatherer societies, because they lacked both the institutional uses of early writing and the social and agricultural mechanisms for generating the food surpluses required to feed scribes.\n\nHe might be surprised, then, to learn about [native Mi'kmaq heiroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%27kmaq_hieroglyphic_writing). Even accounting for the controversy around it, it pokes a hole in his neat narrative, being developed by non-agricultural society.\n\n###Why did these writing systems spread? And how?\n\nHe *says* they spread by religion, trade and conquest, but never talks about it here. Nor does he ever do the work of establishing that the areas that he believes were early language blueprint copiers had ties by trade, conquest or religion.\n\n&gt; Once writing had been invented by those few societies, it then spread, by trade and conquest and religion, to other societies with similar economies and political organizations.\n\nExcept obviously they also spread to societies with *dissimilar* economies and political organization, on account of all the conquering. Funnily enough, he'll later use it to gloss over the violence of genocide, [preferring to call it \"language replacement\".](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6owzax/bad_history_of_writing_guns_germs_and_steel_chp/dkktxn4/)\n\nSure, Diamond makes off-hand references to trade, but by never showing that there *were* trade links between different people (the line quoted above comes a page before the end of the chapter), he gives the impression that language spreads like mono: sheer geographic proximity is enough. All his stories of writing adoption in this chapter go like this: someone sees written language, somehow knows it's an inherent technological advantage, and carefully and deliberately creates an entire writing system, adapting it on the way for their own language. \n\nThis is something he does for pretty much all technologies. Despite an early chapter (chp 13, *Necessity's Mother*) where he says that technologies and inventions are socially influenced, he doesn't ever seem to *use* this approach, preferring to assume (European) guns, germs, and steel are superior. As is Sumerian cuneiform, clearly—remember how he tried to claim that Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs are merely copying the idea of writing from those vaunted Sumerians? Somehow, these early language adopters just magically know those scribbles are writing, and that they could use these alphabets (that they cannot read) for their own language.\n\n###How did these writing systems change after adoption?\n\nDiamond says that early adopters of writing had to adapt them to their own languages, but *never* thinks about how they might change afterwards. He writes that Sumerian cuneiform had settled on a reading order: \n\n&gt; writing should be organized into ruled rows or columns (horizontal rows for the Sumerians, as for modern Europeans); that the lines should be read in a constant direction (left to right for Sumerians, as for modern Europeans); and that the lines should be read from top to bottom of the tablet rather than vice versa.\n\nWhat, then, accounts for modern Arabic's left-to-right order, or the existence of ancient Greek [boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon), where every other line of writing is flipped with reversed letters? Never mind the various changes in spelling, the invention of modern conventions like punctuation, line and letter spacing, or the changing shapes of letters themselves. We could also look at the invention of [simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters) as a more recent example of an overt attempt to change a writing system, in this case to promote literacy. Or, perhaps, the [changes to Arabic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Arabic_alphabet#Early_Islamic_changes) that run hand-in-hand with the growth of early Islam, as new non-native speakers had to be introduced to the language.\n\nBut it's easier for Diamond to pretend that writing, just like language, remained static after it became Roman. It's a common theme in many of his chapters: he'll go from prehistory, to the early centuries CE at most, then let you assume there's a straight line between two thousand years ago and now. If he ever considered the messiness of change, why, he might have to integrate human society, politics, and agency into his story about climate bands!\n\nSpeaking of literacy...\n\n###How widespread was writing in literate societies? How widespread was literacy?\n\nIt baffles me that Diamond can go on and on about the advantages of writing without ever once talking about *printing* in this chapter. He mentions it briefly in earlier chapters, saying that it took Gutenberg's press for the conditions surrounding the invention of printing for it to really take off. But he looks only at the material, not the social. He never takes the time to think about how writing might be transmitted within a given society.\n\nYou'll note that when Diamond says \"writing became more accessible to the public\", he meant Greek society. You know, Greek society, with its well-known literacy rates and public education for everyone. He assumes that, because the earliest preserved examples of Greek, Etruscan and Roman writing is on drinking cups, that must have meant that they were \"vehicles for private communication... co-opted for public or bureaucratic purposes.\" What is his other evidence? Don't hold your breath.\n\nDiamond never accounts for any changing social conditions that might lead to rising (or falling) literacy in the general public. He seems to assume the existence of writing somewhere in a society is enough for all members of that society to benefit from it (which would explain why he thought [illiterate Pizarro personally benefited from thousands of years of European literary tradition](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/)). I can only imagine some form of literary telepathy is involved.\n\n###What other methods of knowledge preservation and transmission exist?\n\nDiamond never seems to understand that people might have other, just as viable, methods of transferring knowledge to different generations. He never acknowledges that writing systems, as a form of technology, are *also* subject to social factors that affect their development and adoption. His off-hand dismissals of proto-writing systems, or other methods of recording data such as the Incan quipus, shows an arrogant attitude towards anything not recognized as \"writing\". \n\nNever mind that Europeans, as in much of the world, had lively oral traditions that ran alongside literate ones—or where did Diamond think Homeric epics like the *Iliad* came from? Folk tales, mnemonic devices, recited works—all of these are ways in which people can transmit knowledge without having to resort to writing. Indeed, given the lack of general literacy for much of human history, how did he think that information was transmitted to the general public? It's that literary telepathy at work again.\n\nAnd lastly,\n\n###How on earth is studying writing systems alone enough to make up for not bothering to look at cultural history?\n\nIn no way does studying the spread of writing systems necessarily tell you anything about the spread of technologies, religions, or food production. The study of the spread of writing systems is *not* a substitute for the consideration of culture—but we couldn't have that dirtying up your precious geographic determinism, now could we?\n\nRelying on the history of writing systems as a stand-in for any cultural history is itself incredibly Eurocentric. It is a history that has been plagued by European assumptions of what qualifies as a \"proper\" writing system, and a field where much evidence of non-Eurasian writing has been destroyed. He uses Chinese and Mayan writing as token efforts to deflect his Eurocentric arguments, but his hyperfocus on Sumerian cuneiform, and on Greek and Latin writing as its successors makes it laughably clear where his biases lie. He falls right into Eurocentric assumptions that writing automatically supplanted all other forms of knowledge preservation and transmission, because it suits him.\n\nThis is ultimately my problem with *GGS*. It's not that I deny that geography *might* have had an influence on history. It's that, to accept anything Diamond says past that sentence, you have to also accept his hatchet-job of human history. He glosses over thousands of years of history, and plenty of other human civilizations, presenting insultingly simplistic histories of non-European nations, in order to make it fit his neat little theory. \n\n----\n*disclaimer: I am neither a historian nor a linguist, merely someone with too much time on her hands and some familiarity with languages other than English. Props to my linguist friends for sharing in my suffering and telling me about some of this stuff. Correct me if wrong!*",

        "text": "In a series of tweets about Donald Trump's ongoing Russian connections, Joy Reid, MSNBC host, slipped in [this gem](http://imgur.com/t3PKLJZ) about Donald Trump's wives. Let's count the errors. First, \"Soviet Yugoslavia.\" Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union were famously at odds, owing to the fact that Tito's partisans largely liberated the areas that became Yugoslavia with little help from the Red Army. The two countries were a part of the COMINFORM from 1945 on, but Yugoslavia was kicked out of the organization in 1948 because of an unwillingness to accept Soviet dominance. In fact, Yugoslavia became a leader of the non-aligned movement. But it doesn't end there. Melania was born in Slovenia, which was, in fact, a part of Yugoslavia, but Ivana, according to Reid, was Slovakian, which was not a part of Yugoslavia. It was a part of Czechoslovakia, which was a part of the Warsaw pact, but not the Soviet Union. Although to be specific, Ivana is Czech and was born in Moravia, which is now a part of the Czech Republic. \n\nBut, like any bad tweet, Reid soon made a correction. Was it any [better?](http://imgur.com/Mz7qDnF) Not at all. She acknowledges that Ivana is Czech, but Slovenia and Slovakia were not the components of Yugoslavia. In case Reid is reading this, the current countries that made up SFR Yugoslavia are Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo (if you are inclined to recognize it). \n\nAs a bonus, check out her [bio.](http://imgur.com/BfsCOmi) Oddly fitting because as of now, she still has not corrected the tweet accurately. I'm not really sure that it is a good thing that blue checkmarked TV hosts tweet out blatantly false information that goes uncorrected in a bizarre mission to question the loyalty of American citizens of Slavic origin. Seems a tad xenophobic.",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! I must credit u/somenbjorn as for this review as, in ages past, he provided a link to the website where I discovered it. The title is Fall of Great Empires – Alexander the Great and the Fall of the Persian Empire\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isQxUC_DILw\n\nI have my imaginary bottle of Glen Grant Single Malt, so let us begin!\n\n0.14: The narrator calls Darius III a king. The problem here is that this was not his title. The Persian ruler was the Shah-an-Shah, or King of Kings. His power and authority was such that his royal rank was considered much higher than a simple monarch. DRINK!\n\n0.40: The narrator asserts that Darius III can still see his world going up in flames. This is a reference to the destruction of Persepolis, and whilst Darius III no doubt heard about what happened to the palace, he was not there to actually witness it. DRINK!\n\n1.32: The narrator states Persia was an empire of desert and rock. If he is referring to the province of Pars (I refuse to call it Fars as this is the Arabic pronunciation, which lacks the Persian 'P' sound), then he is hilariously incorrect. Here are some pictures of the wasteland that is Pars:\n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/theotheriran.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/iran-fars-province-tarom-waterfall-7.jpg\n\nhttp://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/54985354.jpg\n\nhttps://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/96258203.jpg\n\nNow, there are portions of Pars that are arid, but it is a large region with a diverse climate. DRINK!\n\n1.47: The narrator calls Persepolis the capital of the Persian Empire. In truth the Achaemenid ruler maintained multiple capitals and travelled between them. Such complexes included Susa, Pasargadae and Ecbatana. DRINK!\n\n2.04: Reference to the Persian ruler as a king. DRINK!\n\n2.09: Another reference to the Shah-an-Shah as a king. DRINK!\n\n2.24: The historian says that the Achaemenid Empire was in many ways the fore-runner of the Roman Empire. This is absolutely wrong. The Roman Empire had an entirely different administrative and ideological evolution with no connection at all to the Persian model. The Roman Emperor was initially just the princeps, or first citizen, of the Roman state, and the basis of his power came from a republican tradition that abhorred royal monarchies. It took many centuries for the empire to become to become 'imperial'. DRINK!\n\n2.34: The narrator claims the whole known world paid tribute to this empire. The Persians were certainly aware that the world was larger than their empire. Darius I made it clear the boundaries of the states that were subject him:\n\n\"Darius the King says: This is the kingdom which I hold, from the Scythians who are beyond Sogdiana, thence to Ethiopia; from Sind thence to Sardis -- which Ahuramazda the greatest of the gods bestowed upon me. May Ahuramazda protect me, and my royal house. \"\n\n3.03: Yet another reference to the Persian emperor being a king. Are these guys *trying* to kill me? DRINK!\n\n3.12: The narrator once more describes Persia as a desert. DRINK!\n\n3.34: The narrator asserts Persepolis was regarded as the eighth wonder of world. No modern historian or ancient writer I have studied has labelled it such. DRINK!\n\n4.34: \"Looking down, the symbol of the city's former might, the bull of Persepolis\". Unfortunately this is not going to be the only bull in this documentary.\n\n5.28: Nice try, producers! You may be trying to fool me by having a historian call the Shah-an-Shah a king in German, but I am on to you. DRINK\n\n6.07: One more use of the term 'king'. DRINK!\n\n7.16: Another description of the Persian ruler as a king in German. LEGE NEUE LEBER EIN! GETRÄNK!\n\n7.46: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n7.59: The narrator says that Alexander, in his short life, achieved more than any other commander before him. I would dispute this. The first Persian King of Kings, Cyrus, conquered most of the vast area of the empire to begin with. And unlike Alexander, his accomplishments did not fall apart on his death, but continued for another 200 years. I would regard Cyrus as having done far more in that context.\n\n8.24: Alexander is actually using a historically correct saddle with no stirrups. SURPRISING ACCURACY DRINK!\n\n9.45: The biggest mistake here is that the majority of the archaeological team is not made up of starving PHD students.\n\n13.04: The narrator states Darius III used his scythed chariot to flee defeat at the Battle of Issos. Scythed chariots were used only in specific circumstances. The chariot used by the King of Kings would have been highly decorated and a focal point of command. It would most likely have not been intended for combat, and would have lacked scythes as it would have made it dangerous for his cavalry and infantry guard to accompany him. DRINK!\n\n14.46: The Macedonian heavy cavalry here is using what appears to be a Pompeii-style gladius, rather than a xiphos or kopis. DRINK!\n\n14.54: That is clearly a Roman scutum, which would not have been used by either the Greeks or Persian. DRINK!\n\n15.25: \"Faster, or we'll be late for Game of Thrones!\".\n\n15.31: Narrator calls Darius III a king. DRINK!\n\n15.42: More Macedonian cavalry with gladii. DRINK!\n\n16.02: Alexander is now doing his best impression of Scrooge McDuck.\n\n16.42: \"You may now address me as Alexander the Fabulous\".\n\n17.06: Looks like Alexander wasn't exactly equipped with a sarissa, ifyaknowhatimean.\n\n17.37: The narrator claims the Persian King of Kings had megalomania. This..... irks me. I am thoroughly irked now. The Persian rulers believed that they ruled by the blessing of the Zoroastrian god Ahura-Mazda, and thus they had the responsibility to ensure the peace and prosperity of their suspects. Daruis had written in one of his inscriptions:\n\n\"Darius the King says: By the favor of Ahuramazda I am of such a sort that I am a friend to right, I am not a friend to wrong. It is not my desire that the weak man should have wrong done to him by the mighty; nor is that my desire, that the mighty man should have wrong done to him by the weak.\"\n\nPropaganda aside, Persian rulers are also recorded by Herodotus as taking counsel from others and rewarding loyal followers. Greek artwork also shows the Shah-an-Shah debating with his advisers. This is hardly the image of a tyrannical individual. DRINK!\n\n18.06: \"Did Darius, the hated enemy, become Alexander's secret role model?\". I can see Alexander writing in his diary right now: \"OMG Darius-Senpai noticed me!\". Stolen from u/Halocon720.\n\n20.29: Note that the first thing he illuminates is her ass.\n\n22.17: Sure, the graphics for the cut-scenes are great, but those in-game are probably gonna suck.\n\n23.27: The narrator explains that the chariot out-classed every other weapon system. The chariot become obsolete by the time of the Achaemenid Empire, and cavalry were far more flexible and effective. Scythed chariots were used only to try disrupt infantry formations, and has little success. DRINK!\n\n24.05: \"Alexander to dreamt of unlimited power, his battlefield would be the whole world. Minus most of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and North and South America.\n\n25.07: Like in other documentaries, scenes from the ancient period are filmed in color, but those from the early 20th century must be done in sepia tones.\n\nWell, that is that, stay tuned for Part 2!\n\nSources\n\nThe Anabasis, by Xenophon\n\nAncient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550-330 BCE, by Matt Waters\n\nEmpire, Authority, and Autonomy in Achaemenid Anatolia, \n\nThe Histories, by Herodotus, Elspeth R.

He decided to use a very...odd analogy to prove his point - the Ottoman Empire.\n\nI've pasted the transcript here, lightly edited at points, and [linked the video](https://www.c-span.org/video/?431096-1/us-house-approves-national-defense-authorization-act-34481&amp;start=17278) where you can hear his words in all of their glory:\n\n&gt;THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN A LITTLE BIT OLDER HISTORY BACK IN THE 16TH CENTURY AND 17TH CENTURY WHEN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WERE RL SWEEPING ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE, THEY PRESSED THEM INTO SLAVERY. THEY WANTED TO HAVE THEIR CRACK TROOPS AND OTHER TROOPS, TOO, AS WELL, BUT WHAT THEY DID IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM REPRODUCING WAS THAT THEY DID REASSIGNMENT SURGERY ON THOSE SLAVES THAT THEY CAPTURED THAT THEY HAD PUT INTO THEIR TROOPS. AND THEIR REASSIGNMENT SURGERY, THEY TOOK THEM FROM BEING A VIRILE REPRODUCTIVE MALE AND INTO A EUNUCH. THEY WERE SUITABLE TO WORK IN THE HAREM, BUT THEY FOUND OUT WHEN THEY PUT THEM OUT IN THE FIELD TO DO BATTLE AGAINST THE ENEMY, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TEST TOSSER OWN TO TAKE ON THE FIGHT. AND THEY FIGURED OUT TO STOP TURNING THESE MEN INTO EUNUCHS. AND THE OLD HISTORY THROUGH THAT IS REPLETE WITH NARRATIVE AFTER NARRATIVE AND TAKING OUT THE KNIFE AND CUTTING THESE MEN AND SOME WOULD DIE AND SOME WOULD LIVE, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD THE WILL TO FIGHT. THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO KEEP COMPLETE MEN IN THEIR TROOPS WHERE THEY FOUGHT WELL. THAT'S A LESSON FROM THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE \n\nR5: There's quite a bit to unpack here.\n\n\n&gt;BACK IN THE 16TH CENTURY AND 17TH CENTURY WHEN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WERE RL SWEEPING ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE, THEY PRESSED THEM INTO SLAVERY. THEY WANTED TO HAVE THEIR CRACK TROOPS AND OTHER TROOPS, TOO, AS WELL\n\nRep. King is clearly speaking about the [Devshirme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devshirme) system here. From the outset, King isn't exactly correct here, though it isn't his most egregious statement. While slaves certainly were taken during the Ottoman conquests of the Balkans, the vast majority were simply sold as normal slaves. The Devshirme levy occurred every few years during peacetime, and was more akin to lifetime conscription than Western chattal slavery: boys were selected for their strength and intelligence, trained over the course of a decade, and then entered into professional government service either as a bureaucrat or soldier. Induction into the Devshirme system was a fast track to power and privilege in the Ottoman Empire, to the point that the Ottoman government became completely dominated by this elite caste. Later in the system's history muslims actually fought and won the right to have their children subjected to the system.\n\nBut the characterization of Janissaries as slave soldiers is a common one, so this transgression can be forgiven.\n\n&gt;BUT WHAT THEY DID IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM REPRODUCING WAS THAT THEY DID REASSIGNMENT SURGERY ON THOSE SLAVES THAT THEY CAPTURED THAT THEY HAD PUT INTO THEIR TROOPS\n\nWhoa whoa whoa. First of all, King seems to suggest that the Ottoman Empire was regularly conducting sex reassignment surgery on a mass scale in the *16th Century*, when SRS is a complex series of surgical procedures, hormone treatments, and therapy that was not successfully undertaken until the 1930s (I believe). With the context of the rest of his remarks, he's very clearly conflating castration with SRS, which is also completely wrong.\n\nA final note: while Janissaries were forbidden to marry for much of their history, this wasn't done to \"keep them from reproducing\", this was done so that the Janissaries would not have families and thus develop other loyalties besides the Sultan, State, and the Corps. The Janissaries later received the privilege to marry, though it was fairly rare even then.\n\n\n&gt;AND THEIR REASSIGNMENT SURGERY, THEY TOOK THEM FROM BEING A VIRILE REPRODUCTIVE MALE AND INTO A EUNUCH. THEY WERE SUITABLE TO WORK IN THE HAREM\n\nAgain, castration is absolutely not sex reassignment surgery. But more importantly, to my knowledge the boys taken by the Devshirme system were rarely, if ever, castrated and sent to the Palace.\n\nInstead, the Palace (not just the Harem) was operated by a system of eunuchs. [White eunuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapi_Agha), usually drawn from slaves from the Caucuses (again, not from the Devshirme), were initially a very powerful group as they worked closely with the Sultan himself, but as time passed and authority within the palace passed increasingly to the Harem and the women within, the [black eunuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizlar_Agha) (drawn primarily from African slaves and responsible for guarding and staffing the Harem) became the primary eunuch power group, to the point that the position of white eunuch became ceremonial.\n\nSo King is correct in that they could work in the Harem, but they were also important and powerful civil servants and administrators, with many eunuchs serving as provincial governors\n\n&gt;BUT THEY FOUND OUT WHEN THEY PUT THEM OUT IN THE FIELD TO DO BATTLE AGAINST THE ENEMY, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TESTOSTERONE TO TAKE ON THE FIGHT. AND THEY FIGURED OUT TO STOP TURNING THESE MEN INTO EUNUCHS\n\nWhat.\n\nThis is an impressively stupid statement. First of all, once again, *the Janissaries were not eunuchs*. Second of all, Eunuchs in the Ottoman Empire were not used as common combat soldiers (though they may have been used as *commanders*, especially as they frequently served as provincial governors and the head of a provincial government had a military role). Thirdly, testosterone levels do not make a soldier. Aside from the long history of women participating in combat, to this day, success of an army in battle relies on tactics, terrain, training, armament, discipline, morale, logistics, and a hundred other factors, none of which is testosterone levels. Fourth, the Ottoman Empire never really stopped \"turning these men into eunuchs\": [we have pictures of eunuchs from the late 1800s](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/the-black-eunuchs-of-the-ottoman-empire.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=105388&amp;NewsCatID=474), even though slavery had been abolished in the Empire and the eunuchs no longer had any formal court role.\n\nFinally, the period of time when King seems to be referring to rampant castration in the Ottoman military ranks, with a corresponding lack of fighting spirit, was among the Empire's most militarily successful, bringing the Empire to the gates of Vienna.\n\n&gt;THAT'S A LESSON FROM THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE \n\n\nThere are many lessons to be learned from the Ottoman Empire, but this is not one of them",

        "text": "On Mindless Monday, Momojo had brought my attention toward the YouTuber/blogger Real Crusades History (RCH), whose schtick is debunking popular crusade history and submitting his own interpretation of events. Unfortunately, RCH seems to harbor an interest in presenting the crusades as the starting point of a grand Christian vs. Muslim trend, and he tends to be simplistic in his assessment.  \n\nHe came to be famous enough for his credibility to get asked around in our beloved [AskHistorians,](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/30oi83/what_is_the_consensus_on_real_crusades_history/) where thejukeboxhero presents their objections to his style of historical presentation. RCH has since responded with a [blogpost](http://realcrusadeshistory.blogspot.com/2016/03/re-whats-consensus-on-real-crusades.html) of his own.  \n\nNaturally, the thing for me, amateur crusader and random person, to do is to respond again to this blogpost without much thought to my life and limb – true to the old crusading tradition. I've provided you with the links to thejukeboxhero's and RCH's arguments, but I'll quote parts of the relevant sections so that you can follow along as I go. This should be fun, right? Let's do this!  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“His understanding of Islam as a monolithic hive mind bent on devouring Christian Europe is ludicrous and reflects his own ignorance of the diversity and complexity of one thousand years of Islamic civilization.”  \n\n&gt;Thejukeboxhero is setting up a strawman here and misrepresenting my position. Of course I understand that Islam was incredibly diverse and encompassed a wide variety of dynasties and peoples. …  \n\nThere is not much to say at this point. RCH claims that he understands the complexity of Islamic civilization, and he demonstrates this by listing several dynasties and the often-contentious relationship between them. His summary of connections within the Muslim world is indeed accurate – but unfortunately, it’s his description of Muslim-Christian relations that’s flawed, as we shall see.  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“There is no evidence that if unchecked, Islam (whatever that means, the Ottomans aren't the Almoravids, or the Safavids, or the Fatimids) would have conquered all of Europe.”  \n\n&gt;Notice how thejukeboxhero keeps referring to the diversity of groups and dynasties within Islam as if that means Islam as a whole has no overarching identity. …  \n\nRCH misses thejukeboxhero’s argument here. The latter is trying to contend that there was no unified Muslim effort to conquer Europe, but the former instead alleges that they do not think that “Islam” is not a useful description for members of that faith. Frankly, this is not a charitable interpretation because thejukeboxhero has mentioned “one thousand years of Islamic civilization” in the section RCH himself quoted earlier, showing that they’re aware of this categorization.  \n\nDoes RCH assume that thejukeboxhero had forgotten what they said, or is he the one who doesn’t remember what he’s quoting?  \n\nTo be fair, RCH will eventually attempt to address the crux of thejukeboxhero’s argument later, but at the moment, he instead attempts to argue on points that I think both sides could agree on: medieval Christians and medieval Muslims tended to see the opposing side as a single, simplified group of “others”. This is a justifiable claim, and his knowledge of primary sources to elaborate on this matter is remarkable, but it does nothing to address thejukeboxhero’s true argument. While it is important to know how Medieval people saw themselves and others, he should have analyzed how that unsophisticated perception matched and influenced the reality of relationship between them. RCH doesn’t do this here.  \n\nIn a history class, this lack of answer is a surefire method to drench your eyes with the sight of a huge red cross across your essay. But what if we pretend that he actually manages to understand thejukeboxhero’s claim here?  \n\nWell, the closest he has come to addressing thejukeboxhero’s argument in this section is through his example of Saladin, whom he describes to be “casting his designs on ‘the lands of the Franks’ in terms of this larger conflict between Christendom and Mohammedanism, saying he wants to ‘free the earth from anyone who does not believe in Allah’.” At last, this sounds like the beginning for the counter-argument that all Muslims were indeed trying to conquer Europe! Regrettably, RCH fails to explain this evidence and use it as such a counter-argument in two ways:  \n  \n1\\. First, he doesn’t show that this desire to subjugate Christendom is universal among all medieval Muslims, not just Saladin in this example. He does mention in another example that the Ottomans had positioned themselves as the heirs of the Umayyads’ tradition of conquest by assuming the title of caliphs. However, although a primary source would go a long way to illustrate the way the Ottomans saw their caliphate this time around… RCH disappointingly doesn’t deliver when his source expertise is needed the most. We’re instead left with a lot of questions: What is the role of a caliph in the Ottoman Empire? Why did the Ottomans model themselves after the Umayyads exactly? What about the Rashiduns and the Abbasids?  \n\nI wasn’t about to do RCH’s homework for him, but thankfully, we have AskHistorians to shed some light on some of these questions.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5qo9qi/what_happened_to_the_abbasid_dynasty_after/  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3c430h/in_the_beginning_the_caliph_was_someone_with_the/  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1sgnxi/did_any_ottoman_sultans_ever_use_their_role_as/  \n\nTo summarize, although the Ottomans had assumed the title of caliphs for some time, the title itself no longer signified its holder as the leader of all Muslims; it had become a common title for Islamic rulers. It was only in the 19th century that they tried to manufacture a claim of descent from Prophet Muhammad and fully use the title in a political-spiritual sense, to mixed responses.  \n\nSo no, the title of caliphs did not demonstrate the Ottomans’ eagerness to conquer Christendom. They didn’t even use it to claim a relationship with earlier Islamic dynasties until much, much later.  \n \n2\\. Second, he implies too much importance on his source’s face value. RCH has succeeded in highlighting the prevalence of pro-Muslim and anti-Christian rhetoric among Saladin and his entourage, as his quoted passage unmistakably portrays the sultan as an eager wager of holy war – but he does not explain how this rhetoric translated to Saladin’s actions. Did he ever entertain a serious ambition of invading Europe? How much effort did he actually put into “[freeing] the earth from anyone who does not believe in Allah”?  \n\nSaladin died not long after the Third Crusade ended, so we unfortunately couldn’t find out whether he would eventually attempt to sail across the Mediterranean Sea and strike at the European mainland. As far as I know, Saladin had never made any preparation toward this goal, and considering that his empire was constantly plagued with financial difficulties and that there was no material or strategic benefit that he could gain from conquering a territory in that continent, I’m inclined to consider that it was very, very unlikely for him to pursue this purported naval ambition in reality.  \n\nHe did not treat Christians with extreme prejudice as well, to say the least. Of course, he still executed and enslaved many of his foes, but he was as pragmatic as he was zealous. When he conquered Jerusalem, Saladin made a deal with the commander of the city, Balian d’Ibelin, and ransomed its Christian population under generous terms. He had allied himself with Isaac II Angelos, the Byzantine emperor, so he handed the control over most of the city’s churches to the Eastern patriarchate instead of tearing them down. Later, at the conclusion of the Third Crusade, he agreed to recognize the crusaders’ rule of Tyre and allowed Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Lands to continue. All these instances show that Saladin’s attitude toward Christians was more complicated and more measured than a simple reading of that passage would lead you to believe.  \n\nAs a final point, RCH’s [selected quote](https://books.google.com/books?id=amWLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CI+think+when+God+grants+me+victory+over+the+rest+of+Palestine+I+shall+divide+my+territories,+make+a+will+stating+my+wishes,+then+set+sail+on+this+sea&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XIlg_oL0dS&amp;sig=Zy-9i9xNSYARtvks02V6ldfJ4fA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4dqswprVAhVkyVQKHTvFDscQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20when%20God%20grants%20me%20victory%20over%20the%20rest%20of%20Palestine%20I%20shall%20divide%20my%20territories%2C%20make%20a%20will%20stating%20my%20wishes%2C%20then%20set%20sail%20on%20this%20sea&amp;f=false) on the whole focuses more on the terror of the sea and Saladin’s willingness to risk his life and suffer a glorious death for God by sailing across it than it does on the conquest of the Christians. This leads me to conclude that this passage signifies Saladin’s rhetoric more than it does his actual policy. He was not trying to subjugate all of Europe and extinguish Christianity in actuality.  \n  \nSo that’s that. However, if you’ve been paying attention, you would realize that I’m being a little unfair in the analysis of these two examples, because I’ve tried to portray them as arguments for a unified Islamic desire for European conquest when RCH has likely advanced them as evidence for contemporary perception for two opposing religious identities during the Middle Ages, in his wrongful belief that he somehow needs to prove that claim. This is because he will advance the former argument later, and these examples are laden with implications that he is correct in that matter. I’m addressing these implications right now in order to nip the bad history in the bud.  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“The notion that crusading proved to be the crucial event that united Europe is silly as well. It is certainly symptomatic of the more universal identity pushed by the reforming popes of the eleventh century, and while the international scale of the conflict is certainly novel, to suggest that crusade (sic) saved Europe assumes that there was actually a concerted effort by the Islamic world to destroy it.”  \n\n&gt;Nonsense. Crusading extended far beyond the ambitions of the reform popes of the late eleventh century, and the crusades were not merely “international”. The Crusades represented an enormous movement in European Christendom, which would echo down the centuries. …  \n\nThis is a fun part. The Crusades have certainly contributed to a sense of shared identity in Western Christendom, but RCH has placed too much value on its importance in unifying European countries. Therefore, I’m going to evaluate his claims on how the crusading movement has transformed Europe.  \n\n&gt;To start with, the First Crusade created a universal shared experience by the bulk of European Christian societies, with each region having heroes they remembered from that conflict, and whose exploits in this Crusade would be commemorated for generations.  \n\nThis is true to some extent. The Crusades were so celebrated that it influenced much of Western European cultural traditions. Muslims/Saracens/Infidels became a staple foe in chansons de geste (epic songs celebrating deeds and accomplishments), and a lot of adventures described in these songs came to take place in the distant East as well. The most obvious example is perhaps Chanson d'Antioche, which retells an actual conflict in the First Crusade, along with other songs in the Crusade cycle, but there are other chansons that contain such elements as well – like the Chanson de Roland, or the Song of Roland, which famously transforms a skirmish between the Franks and the Basques into an epic battle between Christians and Muslims.  \n\nYet, it’s hard for me to say that this contribution is a thoroughly unique innovation. In terms of a common, shared experience, the different regions of Western Europe had gone through many other historical incidents before the Crusades together, the rule of the Roman Empire being a prominent example among them. Additionally, I would argue that Western Europe’s common religious and legendary tradition had already created a sense of cultural unity even before the Crusades. To illustrate this point, of the Nine Worthies – nine historical and legendary heroes celebrated in the Middle Ages for their chivalry – only one of them, Godfrey of Bouillon, was a crusader. Even then, he is only one of the three Christians in the group, as the rest of them are made of three pagans and three Jews. (Although this does not mean that the Medieval society had neglected their religious perspective in adoring these heroes!)  \n\nAt the same time, the way the Medieval public conceived chivalry and heroism continued to evolve through time as well. While martial prowess and fighting heathens and unbelievers continued to be popular elements in Medieval literature, purely warlike heroes like Roland began to give way to ones who were also well-versed in courtly love and etiquette, like the eponymous protagonist of Gottfried von Strassburg’s Tristan. Fantastic beings like monsters and giants also joined the Muslims as opponents in such later works.  \n\nSo, my verdict is: yeah, kinda, but not that much.  \n\n&gt;After the First Crusade, for centuries to come, Europe’s kingdoms, constantly embroiled in regional and dynastic conflicts with one another, would nevertheless draw on this Crusading consciousness to unite in times of struggle against a threat which they believed transcended petty rivalries among Christian princes, and threatened Christendom itself: the civilization of Mohammed, or as the medievals referred to it, “The Saracens” or “The Moors” or “The Turks”. Wars as far removed from one another as the campaign at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 and the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 both drew on this shared legacy.  \n\nThe Christian participants of the battles that RCH mentions here had indeed drawn some inspiration from the crusading movement, or even were part of its later manifestations, but he has once again overestimated the unity brought by the Crusades. In my original post, I talked about the way Christian countries used to go against the supposed sense of unity within Christendom in order to strike an agreement with Islamic powers, or even form an alliance with them for the sake of pragmatism. The 16th century Franco-Ottoman alliance, which placed the two countries on the same side against other Catholic powers like Spain and Holy Roman Empire, is perhaps the most outstanding example of this trend. This is not to say that there wasn’t a general current of conflict between Christians and Muslims during the Crusades, or that the Medieval conception of Christendom did not exist, but it is far too simplistic for RCH to assume that Christians would always unconditionally work together against the Muslims, especially after the crusades became less and less popular.  \n\nThe idea that the crusading movement has set Christian Europe against Islam is also flawed, because there were crusades directed against followers of other religions as well, such as the Baltic crusades against the pagans living in that region. There are also other crusades that made this argument problematic, but I’ll save it for the next sub-section.  \n\n&gt;Europeans viewed their own wars with each other very differently than they did the wars called Crusades – wars sanctioned by the popes as holy and for which the participants earned spiritual rewards.  \n\nWhoa, pretty sneaky! Suddenly we’re talking about “Europeans” instead of “Christians” now. Well, again, this is true to an extent, but imagine this: what if Europeans waged crusades against other Europeans?  \n\nThis is the second most egregious assumption in RCH’s entire essay; that “Christendom” maps out directly to the entirety of Europe (or Western Europe). Of course, there’s the matter of the Fourth Crusade and its adverse impacts on the Eastern Christians, but the crusading movement had in fact turned itself inward and targeted other Western Europeans as well at some point.  \n\nYou’re probably guessing that I’m referring to the Albigensian crusade. You’re correct – there were crusades that were launched against European heretics, the Albigensian crusade in southwestern France being the most famous of them all. However, the more pertinent examples to put against RCH’s claim are the political crusades.  \n\nThat’s right, the popes had actually declared crusades against their European, Christian opponents, complete with the promise of indulgences. Popes Gregory IX and Innocent IV preached a crusade against the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, and then against his heir, Conrad IV, as they came to dominate southern and northern Italy. Later, in the 14th century, the popes would declare crusades against Venice and Ghibelline (it’s complicated, but for our purposes, it can be reductively described as an anti-papal, pro-emperor party) cities in northern Italy. This is why the idea that the Crusades had single-handedly united Europe is a little absurd. Never mind all Europeans, they could barely define Christendom in terms beyond “anyone whom the popes didn’t mind.”  \n\nNow, there is a case to be made for RCH to argue that the European Christians had somehow overcome these historical kinks and continued to unquestioningly see themselves as a cohesive whole. Furthermore, he can also claim that the idea of Christendom eventually translated itself to the concept of Europe. But he needs to explain these things and provide supporting evidence to make a compelling historical argument, and he doesn’t do them in this essay.  \n\n&gt;For example, when Fernando III of Castile and Leon achieved a stunning victory over the Moors of the Iberian peninsula, Louis IX, the King of France, sent him a thorn from the relic of Christ’s crown of thorns as a symbol of the sacredness of Fernando’s victory over the ancient enemy of Christendom. Louis would have never done that had Fernando won a war against the King of Portugal or the King of Aragon or one of his other Christian rivals.  \n\nThis example is actually quite hilarious because Louis IX had acquired the same crown of thorns by buying it from Latin Emperor Baldwin II, who was desperate to raise some cash to protect himself from various threats, chief among them the Eastern Christian Byzantines.  \n\nI would like to apologize for destroying the idea that relic trading is this super mystical thing Christians did solely in a spirit of unified, militaristic religiosity.  \n\n&gt;What I am talking about here is how European Christians themselves perceived of these things.  \n\nThis is where things get a bit confusing. Is RCH trying to say that the Crusades worked in unifying Europeans because of what the Europeans thought was happening in said wars?  \n\nThat’s not a bad argument in itself – I have mentioned that the way contemporary people saw themselves and others and the reality of the situation did not necessarily need to match; it might actually be true. No, it’s confusing because it implies that he considers “the civilization of Mohammed” being an existential threat to Christendom simply as a popular perception of the time. However, in the next section, he writes…  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“to suggest that crusade saved Europe assumes that there was actually a concerted effort by the Islamic world to destroy it.”  \n\n&gt;This is a strikingly inaccurate comment. How could one honestly look at the history of Christendom’s interaction with Mohammedan civilization and conclude that there was no long-running ambition in the Muslim world to take control of as much of Christian Europe as possible? …  \n\nDo you see what’s happening here? I’ll even say it in bold.  \n\n**There’s no point in implying that the Medieval perception didn’t match reality when you believe that reality was a perfect reflection of said perception, you nincompoop!**  \n\nBut you know what, that’s fine. This is what we’ve come here for: the Jerusalem of bad history in this entire essay. To summarize his argument, he’s claiming that the Muslims had always wanted to subjugate Christian Europe, as evidenced by the many wars and conquests that they waged against the latter’s territory. He further claims that this is the common identity among the Muslims: the wish for their religion to dominate the Christian European lands, and the world.  \n\nNow, I’m going to argue against this point by quoting the pertinent parts of RCH’s claim while replacing the historical events he’s referring in his essay with another. Keep in mind that I’m not trying to construct a strawman; these are analogies that I hope will shed some light on why his argument is flawed. Ready?  \n\nWe’ll go with the crazier example first.  \n\n\"How could one honestly look at the history of Taoist-Confucianism’s interaction with State Shinto civilization and conclude that there was no long-running ambition in the Shintoist world to take control of as much of Taoist-Confucianist East Asia as possible? State Shinto emerged in the late 19th century, and within a few decades had taken control of some two-thirds of the Taoist-Confucianist world: the bulk of Taoist-Confucianist Korea and Manchuria.\"  \n\nI hope I don’t have to explain in depth on why this is dumb. While the Japanese Empire had imposed State Shinto on the territories it occupied, it didn’t wage war against East Asian countries because it was trying to assert its religion. Instead, its main goal was to acquire land and resources and to express its imperialist ambition.  \n\nNow, the saner example.  \n\n\"How could one honestly look at the history of Mesoamerican religion’s interaction with Christian civilization and conclude that there was no long-running ambition in the Christian world to take control of as much of religiously-Mesoamerican America as possible? Christianity was fully established in 15th century Western Europe, and within a few decades had taken control of some two-thirds of the Mesoamerican religion’s world: the bulk of religiously-Mesoamerican Mexico and Panama.\"  \n\nAt first glance, this might make more sense than the previous example because there was a Christianizing component to European colonization of America. However, it would be extremely simplistic of us to reduce this episode in history as a simple clash of religion; the colonizing powers were also driven by the desire to acquire wealth and land, and their attitudes toward proselytizing natives and practically every other issue were far from uniform, even when they had followed the same missionizing religion.  \n\nAnd that is why this entire argument is flawed. Do you remember our discussion on Saladin earlier? That’s right, rhetoric alone does not signify actual policy. RCH needs to demonstrate the religious component of the Arab conquest of North Africa and Andalusia beyond the fact that the conquerors were Muslims and the conquered were Christians, and evaluate just how much it affected their expansionist attitude. He also needs to do the same for the subsequent conquests done by various Islamic powers later on. However, he does not do either of these beyond mentioning the Muslims’ vague desire for proselytizing and prominence – something that they shared with the Christians as well.  \n\nAskHistorians have threads that discuss the role of Islam in the Arab conquest (and vice versa), and I recommend checking them out.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3uozsa/during_the_growth_of_the_islamic_empire_was_it/  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3tyehr/what_main_factors_led_to_islam_spreading_rapidly/  \n\n&gt;Throughout the centuries of warfare between Muslims and Christians, one thing alone prevented Mohammedans from expanding further: Christian military victories.  \n\nI’m tired and a little outraged, so I’ll just rebut this through a series of questions: What about Mongolian invasions? What about Tamerlane? What about conflicts between Muslim powers? What about civil strife and internal dissension?  \n\n&gt;Regardless of how we might think of the Crusades, for Europeans during this period, Crusading was the way they conceived of their resistance to Muslim expansion.  \n\nHe does it again. Did the Crusades, or did the Crusades not actually resist Muslim expansion in reality? Who cares about what the Medieval Europeans perceived in this line of argument?  \n\n&gt;The popes called Crusades in every region where there was a frontier with Islam, in Spain, Italy, Eastern Europe, Syria and Palestine.  \n\nAnd in every region where there was a frontier with pagans, and in every region where there was a frontier with heretics, and in every region where there was a frontier with the popes’ political opponents. That’s probably everywhere, but I’ll keep you in touch after further research.  \n\n&gt;It was broad, it transcended regions, and it was a tradition that went on for centuries. So when I stated in my video that the Crusades were a unifying force that facilitated the survival of European Christendom, I was entirely correct.  \n\nWatching Star Wars as an activity was also broad, transcended regions, and went on for… well, not centuries, but it was still a pretty long time. It was a unifying force, but did it facilitate the survival of America?  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“Again, check out my post on the justifications of crusade in the years following the conquest of Jerusalem. The author of the video seems to take such rhetoric for granted and is generally uncritical of the (two) primary sources he cites.”  \n\n&gt;No, wrong. I’m not using those two primary sources uncritically. I’m not “taking the rhetoric” of these sources for granted at all, I’m merely providing them as an example of a commonplace way of viewing the world among medieval Europeans during the age of the Crusades. …  \n\nI had to go and watch that video as well. It seems that RCH has indeed used the sources as a way to look at the Medieval Europeans’ point of view, but I think they were intended more as a reflection on the warrior class’ new, spiritually edifying role in a crusading world rather than as a statement of Christian, European unity. So on one hand, he has successfully set out on what he’s trying to do, but on the other, I don’t think he has used the sources all too effectively. I have mixed feelings about it, but I’ll give it a pass, I suppose.  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“The video is concerned with proving that the Crusades were, in the long run, a 'good thing'. From an academic and educational point of view, this line of inquiry is problematic at best, intellectually dishonest at worst.”  \n\n&gt;No, again, wrong. Where in my video “How the Crusades Saved Europe” do I state that the Crusades were, in the long run, a “good thing”? I never said that. Thejukeboxhero made that up himself. …  \n\nIn that video, RCH states that Europe and America owes their way of life to the crusaders.  \n\nThis is called “implying.” He does a lot of that in this essay, too.  \n\n  \n\n&gt;“You're better off finding a solid introductory text to the period, such as The Crusades: A Short History by Jonathan Riley-Smith.”  \n\n&gt;I certainly agree with thejukexboxhero that this book by Jonathan Riley-Smith is excellent, as I have used it and many other books by Riley-Smith in my videos as sources. Unlike thejukeboxhero, I make liberal use of primary sources and Crusades scholarship from top-level Crusades historians in all of my videos. …  \n\nReally. Well, I also have a copy of Riley-Smith’s The Crusades: A History, and it’s what I’ve mainly used to write this entire essay. It’s funny how I can use that to rebut the arguments presented here, even when I don’t have as many primary resources available at hand.  \n\n  \n\n&gt;So there you have it, the comments of Thejukeboxhero on reddit thoroughly debunked.  \n\nThis last line is presented here without comment.",

        "text": "This one particularly riles me up, as someone of Indian origin. It started with a USA Today writer, [mentioning](https://archive.is/WYULf) (snarkily, I think), that a lack of people of color or women in the upcoming film *Dunkirk* may \"rub some people the wrong way.\" The conservative share-o-sphere [went running with it](http://archive.is/LFvCF), in their quest to make any search for representation in the movies look ridiculous. And then, today, it got [posted to Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/6okcft/usa_today_complains_about_lack_of_women_and_no/), to the tune of comments like:\n\n* \"They're mad that a British film about British soldiers during WWII has no women in it or blacks? Open a fucking history book.\"\n* \"When feminists and SJWs start revising history to make it fit their agenda, they have become really stupid. History is written. This movies reflects the facts not the fairy tale wish list of fat feminists.\"\n* \"A friend made a joke about this very thing a few days ago. We all laughed and laughed at how ridiculous it would be for anyone to complain about such a thing. And yet, here we are.\"\n\nI'd like to respond to the charge that there were no people of color involved at Dunkirk. What bothers me most, probably, about this line of thought is that none of these comments are based on history--rather, just based on assumptions--which in themselves are based on either earlier pop culture, or what one *wishes* to see in a movie. Nevertheless, as these commenters requested, I cracked open a history book, and found pretty much the opposite of what they would like to see.\n\nThe British and French empires, at the outset of the war, were global and multiethnic — with their holdings in Asia and Africa [far outweighing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1939) the European home countries in population. The British Indian army, by the close of the war, was the largest volunteer army — [ever](http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/documents.php?nid=12). Colonial subjects from places like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Algeria were pressed into service in large numbers. When the Allies were at their most desperate, attempting to defend Britain as the German army menaced it from across the channel, while attempting to also prepare to press the offensive in North Africa, they recruited Indians in massive numbers to stem their losses following their retreat from Europe.\n\nAnd what about Dunkirk? By the time the Allies were retreating from Europe, the French army was at its most depleted for manpower. The units they fielded at Dunkirk had huge percentages of Chadian and Senegalese soldiers, who went on to [form the Free French army](https://www.pambazuka.org/governance/forgotten-african-soldiers-wwii-celebrations) following evacuation (when they returned to liberate Paris, American commanders [requested](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7984436.stm) that de Gaulle remove them from service so an all-white army could enter the city):\n\n&gt;In 1940, the French army included more than 100,000 black French soldiers from France’s African colonies, mainly Senegal, Mauritania,and Niger. More than 75,000 of them served in France before and during the German invasion; the rest of them served guard duty in the various colonies. As the Wehrmacht panzer divisions swept across France in May-June 1940, some of those black French soldiers (about 40,000 of them), mainly organized in black regiments or mixed units, were engaged in fierce combat against German soldiers. About 10,000 black soldiers were killed, some wounded, and others taken prisoner during the French debacle ([source](http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=24173)).\n\nAt least two thousand Indians and hundreds of East African conscripts fought with the British (here's a [photo](http://imgur.com/mPQ66Om.jpg) of a Sikh soldier at Dunkirk):\n\n&gt;Four contingents of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps were sent to support the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1940. There was a need for animal transport companies to help with the supply of troops, as the British Army had disbanded its animal transport companies after the First World War. The British, French and Canadian Forces were cut off by advancing German troops in their push towards the Channel. The soldiers retreated to the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk from where 338,226 were evacuated, among them three contingents of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, while one contingent was taken prisoner by German forces. ([source](http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/battle-and-evacuation-dunkirk-operation-dynamo))\n\nDunkirk was a massive event, so a tour of occurrences happening over its course could ignore these people while remaining more or less accurate— but their appearance (and I’m hearing a single black French soldier does appear), should hardly be out of place. Representation of colonial troops at Dunkirk would be nothing more than realistic representation — to display otherwise might be called revisionism. \n\nI feel compelled to call out this type of bad history because this is more than whitewashing a movie--it's whitewashing real, lived experience for the sake of remembering only the involvement of white people, to the point that people laugh at the assumption that people of color could be involved in anything at all.

I know that's a little rough for you to handle. I know you want to hold on to that...somehow thinking whites built the Pyramids, but I'm trying to understand.\n\nSPENCER: Yeah, we did.\n\nMARTIN: No, you didn't. They were building things in Egypt while white Europeans were still in caves. That's a fact.\n\nThis exchange is interesting because two extreme positions that proliferate online and often clash with one another—white supremacy and Afrocentrism—are being played out in a live humorous dialogue that ventures into the absurd, with both sides engaging in some questionable history.\n\nAnyone who has a passing familiarity with the meme-o-sphere has probably come across the [\"WE WUZ KANGZ\"](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-wuz-kings) meme at one time or another. \n\nIf you've never seen it before or don't know what it is, I'll explain it briefly. Basically it's a meme that is believed to have originated on /pol/. It's mainly used by white supremacists to poke fun at Afrocentrists, aka [Hoteps](http://neguswhoread.com/five-kinds-hotep/), who fetishize ancient Egypt as [\"a black civilization\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Egyptian_hypothesis).\n\nThe question of the race and the ancient Egyptians is anachronistic in two ways: For one, race is an outmoded unit of analysis for archeologists and scholars in general. Furthermore, Egyptians themselves didn't think in terms of race. \n\nSo while tracking the DNA ancestry and the population history of the ancient Egyptians is a useful scientific pursuit, spending time and money trying to quantify the amount of melanin in the skin of 4000-year-old mummies so that we can classify them into categories (Caucasoid, Negroid, etc.) that geneticists and anthropologists have long since moved past seems like an exercise in silliness.\n\nBut back to the issue that Martin and Spencer are discussing: Were the Egyptians black as we understand the meaning of the term today? \n\nWell, no, not exactly. At least, not primarily. But, with the exception of the Ptolemaic dynasty that would rule in the later years before the Roman conquest, they weren't what people today would consider \"white\" either. In fact, we know definitively that at least the rulers of one dynasty, the 25th Dynasty, which ruled Egypt for about a century from 760 BCE to 656 BCE, were Nubians from the southern Kingdom of Kush and they would be considered black.\n\nBut neither the Ptolemaic Dynasty nor the Nubian Dynasty built the Pyramids, which were constructed far earlier in the 26th Century BCE during the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. In October 2016, a team of researchers were able to finally put the question to bed once and for all when they successfully [sequenced the genome](http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/were-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white-scientists-now-know) of a mummy from the New Kingdom Period (1,388 BCE) at the height of Egypt's power.\n\nThe verdict? They were brownish, much like their descendants. \n\nThe tests determined that they were most closely related to populations who moved to the area from the Levant aka the Near East. This confirmed the mainstream view among Egyptologists that Ancient Egyptians constituted a local population made up of multiple ethnicities that converged in the fertile Nile Delta region. The 8 percent sub-Saharan admixture in modern-day Egyptians did not enter the population until about 1,500 years ago, possibly due to the slave trade, according to the study. \n\nThe findings of the study are consistent with the art portraying the ethnicities present in and around Egypt that Spencer erroneously used as evidence to support his argument. In this [fresco](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Races2.jpg) from the tomb of Seti I, four ethnic groups are depicted from left to right: Libyans, Nubians, Asiatic and Egyptians. On the far right, the Egyptians are depicted as darker than the Libyans or Asiatics but lighter than the Nubians.\n\nBut why Spencer and the alt-right so adamant to ridicule the Black Egyptian Hypothesis? It has nothing to do with a commitment to historical accuracy. \n\nThe aim of denying the \"blackness\" of Egyptians is core to the white supremacist narrative that, when left to their own devices, black people were (and still are) incapable of developing technology or civilization. They commonly point to the failure of sub-Saharan tribes to develop a written language as proof of their genetic inferiority.\n\nBut Afrocentrists and black supremacists often try to flip this narrative as Martin did in the interview when he said that Africans were building Pyramids while white Northern Europeans were living in caves.\n\nStill, what I find most fascinating about this is not even the historical question of whether or not the Egyptians were black—it's somewhat irrelevant—but rather the [history of the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy) itself and how the views have changed over time in tandem with the rise and fall of scientific racism, colonialism and then later the advent of genomics research.\n\nThe alt-right's attempts to revert the scientific understanding of biological race back to where it was at the turn of the 20th century run in parallel with the effort to turn back the clock on archaeology to an earlier colonialist view of Egyptology, which, like Spencer, considered Egypt to be a \"white\" society.\n\nThe earliest theory, which dominated from the 6th century to the mid-19th century, was the Asiatic theory, which was mostly Biblical in origin, and stated that the Egyptians were \"the descendants of Ham.\" \n \nLater this view was supplanted by two Eurocentric theories. The first was the Caucasian hypothesis. Samuel G. Morton, the skulls and mustard seeds guy, was one of the first advocates of this theory, who proclaimed in 1844 that Egypt was populated originally by \"a branch of the Caucasian race.\" He admitted that Negroes were present but insisted they were only captured slaves or servants. \n\nThen there was the so-called Hamitic hypothesis, which rejected the Bible stuff but kept the name (I guess because it sounds cool and also kinda sciency?). It also stated that the Egyptians were an Ethiopid or Arabid people from the Horn of Africa. This view also asserted that these were Caucasian people and they brought all civilization and agriculture to the region.  \n\nThe Hamitic theory held sway among some circles well into the 20th century, when it was challenged first by the [Dynastic race theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynastic_race_theory), and in the 1950s by the Black African Theory. The Dynastic Race Theory argued that the First Dynasty was established by a Mesopotamian group who brought civilization from the east to the local population, but that since has been overruled by genomics evidence, as I previously stated.\n\nBut now we come to the story of the Black African Hypothesis proposed in the 1950s by Senegalese anthropologist and historian [Cheikh Anta Diop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheikh_Anta_Diop). Today, Diop's quest to prove the Egyptians were black might seem Quixotic to us today, and Diop himself might be dubbed a Hotep.\n\nDiop was a remarkable character who virtually alone tried to overturn the entire paradigm of Egyptology, a discipline dominated by European academics. And though his Black Egyptian Hypothesis is now considered largely discredited, he was ahead of the curve in his support of the Out of Africa theory at a time when the multi-regional theory of human origins still held sway. \n\nWhile some of his academic work may have been flawed or misguided, his legacy is important. He will be remembered for his insistence that Africans themselves should define what it means to be African and not have that definition forced upon them by their colonizer. And he took issue with attempts by European scholars to reassert racialist classification of \"whiteness\" and \"blackness\" via a geographical proxy, such as Mediterranean vs. Sub-Saharan, which is precisely what Spencer does, when he insists that Egyptians are \"North African.\"\n\nIn his work \"The Evolution of the Negro World,\" Diop wrote:\n\n&gt; But it is only the most gratuitous theory that considers the Dinka, the Nouer and the Masai, among others, to be Caucasoids. What if an African ethnologist were to persist in recognizing as white-only the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, and systematically refused membership to the remaining Europeans, and Mediterraneans in particular—the French, Italians, Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese? Just as the inhabitants of Scandinavia and the Mediterranean countries must be considered as two extreme poles of the same anthropological reality, so should the Negroes of East and West Africa be considered as the two extremes in the reality of the Negro world\n\nIt's important to point out that Diop's argument did not rest solely on genetics but rather evidence of shared cultural traits between Egypt and Central Africa, such as specific rituals of circumcision that differed from those practiced by Semitic peoples.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that the standard of proof for evidence that the Egyptians were black has historically been much higher than that needed to assert that any other civilization, such as Ancient Greece or the Roman Empire, was “white,” which has always been accepted as a given.\n\nLike the Egyptologists of Britain and the other colonial powers, the alt-right seeks to retcon humanity’s origin story to write non-white people out completely, and the motives are much the same. But Afrocentrism, in trying to counter this, swings the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. In the end, both sides aim to utilize history as a weapon in present political debates on race to the detriment of objectives of disinterested historical and archaeological scholarship\n\nEDIT NOTES: \n\n* Elaborated on Diop's views with regard to culture \n\n* Included some more information that places Spencer's comments on Egypt being \"North African\" in the broader historical context of the Egyptian race controversy as it played out mid-1950s.\n\n* I tried to balance the last paragraph with the view that Afrocentrism is just as much a political threat to objective scholarship as Eurocentrism\n\n* Changed the description of Spencer's National Policy Institute from \"far-right\" to \"white nationalist\" at the request of a commenter. \n",

But I asked that. So I asked the president, so what about Napoleon? He said: “No, no, no. What he did was incredible. He designed Paris.” [garbled] The street grid, the way they work, you know, the spokes. He did so many things even beyond.  And his one problem is he didn’t go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather?\n\n[Emperor of the French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_the_French)\n\nTrump may be conflating [Napoleon I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) and [Napoleon III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III), his nephew.  Napoleon I abdicated the throne the final time on 22 June 1815, mere days after his defeat at Waterloo.  Napoleon III would not come into power until a few decades later.  First as President of the French Second Republic on 20 December 1848, and then seizing power as Emperor of the Second French Empire on 2 December 1852.  Napoleon III would then later [commission the renovation of Paris as an imperial project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Paris).\n\nOne may forgive Trump for not knowing there was more than one Napoleon or France's love-hate relationship with republics and monarchies. Almost understandable, even.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;And his one problem is he didn’t go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather?\n\n?? Still trying to decipher this word salad.  Napoleon I enjoyed military strategy and war, so I don't think extracurricular activities were the problem.\n\nNapoleon was defeated strategically when the Grand Armee was unable to force the Russians into a decisive engagement and destroy their armies with missed opportunities at Grodno, Vitebsk, Smolensk and Borodino.  Hence Napoleon's inability to force Tsar Alexander to the table with a [Tilsit-style peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Tilsit).\n\nBut Trump is generally correct that weather played a role in stopping Napoleon's invasion.  The looming threat of winter and the Russians continually being able to withdraw in good order provided the impetus for the Russians to continue fighting.    \n\nHowever, the full impact of the Russian winter did not come into play until Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.\nHot weather, [mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasputitsa), marsh, poor foraging terrain and roads arguably played a greater role than General Winter, with most of the casualties of the Grand Armee incurred on the march to Moscow.\n  \nTemperatures during the Russian summer in 1812 averaged around 30C with thunderstorms over Vilnius turning Russian roads into mud.  Disease and exhaustion while trudging through muddy roads would have a large impact on both soldiers and the supply train.  De Tolly's decision to commit to scorched-earth tactics against Napoleon \nalso drastically weakened the ability of the Grand Armee to supply itself, and the underdeveloped infrastructure and farmland naturally could not sustain a force of such size. \n\nBy the end of summer the Grand Armee would lose a third of its number (Zamoyski 2005).  By Borodino and the capture of Moscow in mid-September, the Grand Armee would have lost over two thirds of its original number, an unsustainable number of casualties given the still intact Russian force under Kutuzov.  The most consequential engagements and decisions in this invasion occurred long before the first snow fell in Moscow.\n\nObligatory link to [Charles Minard's 1869 infographic on Napoleon's invasion of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia#/media/File:Minard.png)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBonus:\n\n&gt;TRUMP: Same thing happened to Hitler. Not for that reason, though. Hitler wanted to consolidate. He was all set to walk in. But he wanted to consolidate, and it went and dropped to 35 degrees below zero, and that was the end of that army.\n\nI'm always surprised that the \"Kiev or Moscow\" debate finds its way to the strangest of places.  \nTrump is a valid secondary source on all things Barbarossa now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nLouis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, [*Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, Complete*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3567/3567-h/3567-h.htm), 1831\n\nPaul Britten Austin, *1812: The March on Moscow*, Greenhill Books, 2000.\n\nAdam Zamoyski, *Moscow 1812: Napoleon's Fatal March*, Harper Perennial, 2005.",

I want you to read all of this and come to your own conclusion.\"\n\nAs you can see in the articles above... Georgia's declaration of causes contains:\n\n&gt;This state of facts gave form and shape to the anti-slavery sentiment throughout the North and the conflict began. Northern anti-slavery men of all parties asserted the right to exclude slavery from the territory by Congressional legislation and demanded the prompt and efficient exercise of this power to that end. This insulting and unconstitutional demand was met with great moderation and firmness by the South. We had shed our blood and paid our money for its acquisition; we demanded a division of it on the line of the Missouri restriction or an equal participation in the whole of it. These propositions were refused, the agitation became general, and the public danger was great. The case of the South was impregnable. The price of the acquisition was the blood and treasure of both sections-- of all, and, therefore, it belonged to all upon the principles of equity and justice.\n\nIn the declaration of causes from Mississippi:\n\n&gt;In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.\n\n&gt;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. \n\n&gt;Utter subjugation awaits us in the Union, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. We must either submit to degradation, and to the **loss of property worth four billions of money**, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property.\n\nThe bold portion is referring to the estimated cost that abolishing slavery would entail, because remember, they didn't consider them people, they considered them property.\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\n&gt;The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\n\n&gt;But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.\n\nSo basically... By the northern states granting a sort of refugee status to \"fugitives\" (aka slaves that fled the south for the north), they are accused of violating the Fourth article of the Constitution. So the south's \"states rights\" WERE being violated. Their right to own slaves. So the secession was about slavery. Right? Why is this controversial?\n\nWithout making this too long... Texas and Virginia say pretty much the same thing... That the north has violated the constitution by invalidating the slave-status of southern slaves, focusing on their definitional difference as either slaveholding or non-slaveholding states, and stating their secession because of the violation of their states rights on deciding what to do about slavery. AKA the \"states right to own slaves\" as it is put nowadays by commentators on the subject.",

These same poetic accounts do imply that she enjoyed it however but honestly 2 men in like 22 years of reign is fucking weak. I realise that nothing is more erotic than politically motivated serial monogamy with older Roman politicians that you barely know, I mean Roman matrons were the real players of the ancient world, but going all out and saying that she was obsessed with sex is a little generous.\n\nThere is literally more literary evidence for Julius Caesar's affair with Nicomedes or any of the Romans who were accused of sleeping with their sisters than there is for Cleopatra's vivid sex life. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but just because you can not definitively disprove something does not mean it is proven to be true, why does everyone think that is how history works?\n\nBut dildo pioneering?

Also there is literally no reason to think that she did engineer dildos because the oldest mention of this is from a [book on unusual sex practices that was published in 1992 and authored by someone called Brenda Love](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MfmNPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=editions:uJIH-gD3-b4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR45OD2ZDVAhWGL1AKHf8dA-EQ6AEIOzAF) despite never being indicated by any source or evidence from Antiquity or the Middle Ages. Seems Legit. Further down\n\n&gt;One invention was the dildo filled with live bees\n\nOk I am going to need a source...\n\n&gt;The girl at my local sex shop said Cleopatra invented the first iteration of the vibrator that was essentially a hollowed out piece of wood, that housed live bees to create the vibration.\n\nOh, I had no idea a specialist covered this topic, by all means carry on.\n\nSeriously though I could go the easy route of simply pointing that there is not a single ancient source mentioning this but to be honest I want to ask how stupid you have to be for this to sound reasonable. I mean, if you wanted to take a gourd or a piece of wood and you filled it with bees which were magically trained to fly at top speed perpetually, how much vibration could this even produce? We need Mythbusters on this, I am not interested in testing this and also have a severe bee allergy irl.\n\n&gt;She also sucked off 1000 Roman noblemen in one night apparently.\n&gt;Edit: 100\n\nLol, wut? Another user in the thread pointed out that she literally would not have enough time even if she managed a Roman a minute without taking a break. His response:\n&gt;Sorry it was actually 100 my bad.\n\nTo be fair, by my reckoning that gives her a little over 7 minutes per Roman without taking a break which is still pretty ridiculous. This is also an interesting ploy to gain the respect of Roman politicians, I truly doubt it would really do well for your reputation or general social standing, but still an imaginative gambit nonetheless. My real question is why did no Roman authors ever mention this and can you teach me your time travelling skills to divine this information? Also most versions of this internet legend have it happening in Rome but I honestly have to wonder why Julius Caesar would be OK with this, having your mistress go down on a few hundred of your colleagues and/or rivals would be kind of...concerning?\n\n&gt;She was also famous for her ability to perform oral sex. Her admirers (and enemies) called her \"the gaper.\"\n\nOh my god, Sources please?! I think I am going to die on this thread, who even comes up with this stuff?\n\nOn the bright side there were some people debating whether or not Roman sources on Cleopatra should be trusted outright which is admirable although it is kind of a depresssing conversation to see if you know that Roman sources do not have bee vibrators or Roman noblemen orgies.\n\nI actually think there was a TIL featuring 300 Senators a while back but I have no idea where this from either, although I never did have time to sift through the published translations of Virgil's pornography collection, I had to get back to my studies after *Render Unto Caesar That Which Is Sexy* and *Two Consuls, One Cup*.\n\n[The link to the relevant thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6na5du/what_xrated_history_facts_dont_they_teach_you_in/dk89afo/) which currently has around 4000 upvotes, meanwhile I can turn out a thousand words on societal and cultural change following Alexander's conquest of Egypt and get a grand total of 4 upvotes.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6nrroo/the_tulsa_race_riots_whats_all_the_fuss_about_yall/",
        "text": "The brilliant amateur historians of the alt-right are at it again with an effort to [debunk](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/comments/6nk9ue/did_the_tulsa_race_riot_even_happen_srs/?st=j57rypjv&amp;sh=e62aab33) the [Tulsa Race Riot of 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot), arguably the worst single incidence of white-on-black racial violence in US history.\n\nThe post starts with a fuzzy retelling of the incident, which lends it a kind of \"It was all a big misunderstanding\" sort of flavor:\n\n&gt; At first glance it seems like a genuine grievance in the event itself. IE rape accusation, paranoid blacks thinking guy will be lynched without trial are armed and tell the cops/judge their POV, white guys angry at armed black guys tell them to drop weapons, on and on then a firefight breaks out, lots of blacks die etc.\n\nAlready this omits many of the important details, namely the specifics about the incident that led to the riots. [Dick Rowland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Rowland) a 19-year-old black shoe-shiner was accused of sexually assaulting Sarah Page, an elevator operator, though most accounts say he tripped upon entering the elevator and reflexively grabbed Page's arm to break his fall. There are other theories that the two were lovers and they were having a fight.\n\nPage declined to press charges, but the police arrested Rowland anyways, leading the white-owned *Tulsa Tribune* to run an [article](http://www.greenwoodculturalcenter.com/tulsa-race-riot) with the incendiary headline \"Police Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator.\" Some sources reported reading in the same edition an editorial calling for Rowland's lynching.\n\nI take exception with calling the black people of Tulsa \"paranoid\" in this case. A more accurate phrasing would be \"justifiably concerned.\" The white citizens' response to a black man grabbing a white woman's arm was to try to lynch him and then proceed murder 150-300 people and reduce the entire black part of town to ashes. Doesn't that make *them* paranoid?\n\nThen OP starts to move into the conspiratorial from there:\n\n&gt; That being said, something is very very wrong with this event. The history of it, the timing of discoveries, and what not.\n&gt; I became suspicious when I saw this event under a list of \"pogroms\" which are traditionally (but not always) attributed to Jewish individuals. When I saw that I thought \"Jesus christ it seems just like the 5 gorillion fellow goyim that Weisenthal made up.\"\n\nOP's Nazi-sense has started to tingle. Don't worry, fellow Aryans! Detective Goebbels is on the case and he has vowed to leave no Wikipedia article un-skimmed!\n\nHis first piece of \"evidence,\" drawn, like the rest of his \"analysis\" from a single Wikipedia article is that there are no records about the number of people who died in the National Guard's interment camps set up when it was called in to quell \"the negro uprising.\" NOTE: Thousands of black people were arrested in large numbers and interred, but the white mob that perpetrated the vast majority of the violence was left untouched because of collusion with the local city government and state authorities. \n\n&gt; Yep some of our fellow black goyim were put in concentration camps! They lost 6 billion american blacks in concentration camps. I mean we don't have any proof, but it's just true\n\nOP points out the lack of information about a particular subset of the deaths that occurred—those in the interment camps— and immediately proceeds to cast doubt on all the numbers regarding the death toll.\n\nThen he goes on to again quote Wikipedia: \"The state government has made limited attempts to find suspected mass graves used to bury the unknown numbers of black dead. The Commission reported that it was not authorized to undertake the necessary archaeological work to verify the claims\"\n\nOP is baffled by this: \n\n&gt; Again, lack of evidence. \"Not authorized\" to verify claims, or \"not interested\" in looking for proof? The whole point of the comission is to look for fucking proof\n\nOf course, OP didn't bother to read the actual [2001 report](http://www.okhistory.org/research/forms/freport.pdf) by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riots in which professional historians, archeologists, forensics experts, etc. thoroughly reviewed the archival evidence. I'm guessing reading the report would cut into his busy schedule of posting cartoons of green frogs dressed like Augusto Pinochet on 4chan or sending anonymous rape threats to female vloggers for feminist critiques of Super Mario Brothers.\n\nIn the commission's report, it specifically addresses the fact that large-scale excavations weren't cost effective so they limited their search for mass graves to non-invasive techniques, like radar scans. They were searching for signatures of mass graves in the traditional sense, i.e. one big hole with lots of bodies, but contemporary evidence suggests that bodies were buried in individual plots, so they might be especially hard to detect if the area where they were searching also included pauper's graves, or unmarked burials.\n\nAccording to Walter White of the NAACP: \n\n&gt; O.T. Johnson, commandant of the Tulsa Citadel of the Salvation Army, stated that on Wednesday and Thursday the Salvation Army fed thirty-seven Negroes employed as grave-diggers and twenty on Friday and Saturday. During the first two days these men dug 120 graves in each of which a dead Negro was buried. No coffins were used. The bodies were dumped into the holes and covered over with dirt.\n\nJohnson's statement is corroborated by oral interviews conducted on behalf of the commission with relatives of the grave-diggers hired to dig the plots.\n\nNext, OP looks at the disparities between the death tolls reported in newspapers at the time and concludes with his brilliant powers of deduction that some sort of fuckery is going on, as if real-time reporting on death tolls in the middle of a war zone were a simple process.\n\nHe observes:\n\n&gt; Again, lack of evidence. The numbers are all fucking over the place.\n\nThe commission, after historians reviewed the findings, went with the records of the Red Cross as the upper limit and the accounts of the Salvation Army commandant as the lower boundary plus the 39 dead confirmed in official death certificates. (There were only death certificates for the few blacks who died in the hospital. The only two black hospitals were burned down in the riots, and blacks had to cross a warzone to get to the segregated white hospital with the vague hope that they would be admitted.) In total, the best, most reliable estimate ranges from about 160 to 300, not including those who may have died later from injuries sustained in the rioting. Some estimates go up as high as 500. Property destruction was 1,200 homes burned and $16.7 million (today's dollars) in property damage or looted property.\n\nOn the white side, the estimate is smaller and more accurate since all the white victims were hospitalized for their injuries and pronounced dead in the hospital. For that number the Commission tallied 13.\n\nOP then quotes the Wikipedia article once more: \"The Tulsa race riot of 1921 was rarely mentioned in history books, classrooms or even in private. Blacks and whites alike grew into middle age unaware of what had taken place.\"\n\nNow, he feels like he's **really** onto something! Having apparently never heard the term \"whitewashing,\" OP concludes, \"So this is the main thing; the entire event was essentially \"unknown\" for a long fucking time, and there is essentially no evidence to confirm/deny most of the allegations.\" (except for all that evidence)\n\nFunnily enough US history books also tend to gloss over the fact [mass white-on-black racial violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_racial_violence_in_the_United_States) happened like this on a yearly basis for nearly a century, peaking in an nation-wide orgy of [anti-black violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Summer) only two years prior. \nOP ends by reiterating his anti-Semitic thesis:\n\n&gt; Whether or not something fucked up happened is not my claim; my claim is that these \"historians\" arbitrarily found a loosely archived event in history (this race riot) and turned it into an agenda laden narrative \"supported by experts\". Maybe as a Judeo-Leftist attempt to lure blacks into the alliance fold as fellow Pogrom/Holocaust victims. \n\nOP thinks [14 large legal-sized boxes stuffed with primary historical records](http://www.osu-tulsa.okstate.edu/library/Archives/Series_1_TulsaRaceRiot.pdf) and hours upon hours of taped oral interviews = \"loosely-archived \n\nOP then adds a note at the bottom to provide further \"evidence\" of the conspiracy:\n\n&gt; also, someone put a revert \"cabal order\" on this topic. Which means they have people/bots actively monitor edits and IMMEDIATELY revert any/all edits made by \"non approved\" individuals on the subject, regardless if the addition is accurate or not. It's probably George Soros's Open society operatives\n\n::S H A K E S  F I S T :: DAMN YOU GEORGE SOROS!!! DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!\n",

I guess it lets them live out their fantasies of fighting for their ideologies on the streets like it's Weimar Berlin.) Anyways, one of our best and brightest posted [this gem](http://imgur.com/a/MQjux) around the 4th of July. \n\nThis meme is, of course, extremely asinine. Great Britain was a monarchy, Socialism is an actual belief structure with common traits. Big government is not inherently socialist and just because a government does more does not make it more Socialist. The American Revolution was the result of many complex causes and motivations, and while it is easy to look at the Boston Tea Party and say the Revolution was based on taxes, it was really more of a response to increasing British involvement in their North American colonies following the Seven Years War and the lack of colonial representation in Parliament. This increasing of tensions can be seen particularly in Boston, where events like the Boston Massacre and Tea Party eventually boiled over into open hostilities and war.\nFinally, and perhaps most egregiously, Socialism would not be developed for decades, well into the 1800s; so really, the Founders would have no idea what neither Bernie nor this meme are talking about.",

It is time for the second part of my review of Deadliest Warrior Season 2, Epsiode 3: Attila the Hun versus Alexander the Great:\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x511mvj\n\nSo let us being!\n\n20.05: \"The gastrophetes, a killing machine with devastating firepower\". As opposed to one with slightly annoying firepower.\n\n20.49: The way they are testing the gastrophetes is to shoot at several targets that are moving  back and forth in a predictable fashion at close range. A more suitable evaluation would be to see if the person  would be able to hit a horse size target in motion at long range, as that would be far more realistic. A horse archer would *never* come close to an army that had soldiers equipped with bows or crossbows as they would be far too vulnerable. DRINK!\n\n20.56: One of the hosts decides that the gastrophetes will be used on foot, completing negating the idea of Alexander fighting as heavy cavalry. DRINK!\n\n21.20: Robert Borsos is loosing arrows barely 20 meters away from the target. How do you spell \"pin-cushion\" again?\n\n23.49: \"Back in the fight club we're re-writing history\". By making it worse?\n\n24.06: Inaccurate Persian shield! DRINK!\n\n24.41: I know they said Rashad Evans is back, but I like to think he just kept hanging around the studio so they eventually just gave up and found something for him to do.\n\n25.01: Anachronistic Persian shield. DRINK!\n\n25.24: Hehehehehehe, 'butt-spike'.\n\n27.20: The rider testing the xyston has a modern saddle and stirrups, and is holding the weapon in one hand. Alexander would have used only a clothe saddle, and utilized the xyston in both hands. DRINK!\n\n28.08: They are countering the xyston with the lasso. I have no words.\n\n28.19: \"You slowly placed a length of rope around my waste! Curses, my sword is now useless!\"\n\n29.53: A spear is a superior offensive weapon to a piece of rope? Get out of here with that crazy!\n\n30.14: HOLLYWOOD COMBAT ROLL! DRINK!\n\n30.41: Incorrect Persian shield. DRINK!\n\n30.55: One of the 'experts' says the kopis was responsible for Alexander's conquests. Funny, I thought it was a veteran army practicing combined-arms tactics, a talented officer corps, and being lead by a genius commander which did that. DRINK!\n\n31.31: Attila has the Sword of Mars, which is supposedly made out of iron from a meteor. According to Jordanes, Attila supposedly found the Sword of Mars, which was the sacred weapon of the Scythian kings. Jordanes makes not mention of the weapon being made from a meteor, and in reality Attila would have had a highly-decorated Migration Period spatha, but that is of course too prosaic for this show. DRINK!\n\n32.13: The skulls in this show come from staff who attempt to insist on historical accuracy.\n\n32.24: And another weapon demonstration done by people riding a horse with a modern saddle and stirrups. DRINK!\n\n32.42: \"Take that, unarmoured piece of meat!\"\n\n35.18: \"We're not looking for pain, we're looking for death\". I see this man was also once a High School teacher.\n\n38.17: And now we enter..................THE MATRIX!\n\n38.27 \"Alexander, wouldn't it be simpler if we just charge the Huns rather than spend three hours setting up this thing?\". \"STFU, Amyntas\".\n\n38.36: \"Is it me, or does that sound like someone loading a ballista?\".\n\n39.13: \"Hahahahaha, killing people is hilarious!\".\n\n39.14: This actor went to the Star Trek school of extended death scenes.\n\n39.22: \"Give me back my rope!\". \"No, I need it to complete my collection!\".\n\n39.37: So Alexander grabs a small pelta from one of the fallen Macedonian troopers. Any infantry personally accompanying Alexander would have been Hypaspists, and would be equipped with the larger hoplite aspis. DRINK!\n\n39.39: I like how they made no account for the shields when initially evaluating their equipment. Also, what the hell happened to the other soldiers?\n\n40.00: \"My arm! This will not hinder me in the slightest!\".\n\n40.45: Attila won the battle, but Makeboos shall win the war!\n\nAnd that is that.\n\nSources\nBy the Spear: Philip II, Alexander the Great, and the Rise and Fall of the Macedonian Empire, by Ian Worthington\n\nThe Composite Bow, by Mike Loades\n\nThe Origin and Deeds of the Goths, by Jordanes: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14809\n\nThe Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China 221 B.C. to AD 1757, by Thomas Barfield\n\nThe Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28587\n\nShadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War, by Kaveh Farrokh\n\nWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900, by Guy Halsall\n",

        "text": "http://tomatobubble.com/arch_of_titus.html\n\nI. \"The fact that the majority of modern Jews are descended from European converts or converted Khazarian Turko-Huns (Ashkenazi), and not from the ancient Judeans of Titus's day, doesn't matter. Why ruin a grand self-delusion, a fun party, and a great fairy tale? Rome is gone, the Jewish Money and Media Barons are lording over the Western Hemisphere, and nuclear-armed U.S.-backed Israel isn't going away anytime soon. What a reversal of fortune indeed!\"\nThere is no evidence that Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Khazars, as this quote by a professor of history at Hebrew University indicates. \n “There never was a conversion by the Khazar king or the Khazar elite. The conversion of the Khazars is a myth with no factual basis.” As a historian, he said he was surprised to discover how hard it is “to prove that something didn’t happen. Until now, most of my research has been aimed at discovering or clarifying what did happen in the past ... It’s a much more difficult challenge to prove that something didn’t happen than to prove it did.”\nThat’s because the proof is based primarily on the absence of evidence rather than its presence – like the fact that an event as unprecedented as an entire kingdom’s conversion to Judaism merited no mention in contemporaneous sources. “The silence of so many sources about the Khazars’ Judaism is very suspicious,” Stampfer said. “The Byzantines, the geonim [Jewish religious leaders of the sixth to eleventh centuries], the sages of Egypt – none of them have a word about the Jewish Khazars.”\n http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.601287\nVarious genetic studies have proven the same. \n\n\nII.Rome did not fall because of the Jews and moral degeneracy. But that is too stupid to respond to.\n\n\nIII. 'The \"chosen\" Zealots didn't believe in diversity!' This a gross oversimplification of their rise. First, they were being ruled by pagans who did things like appoint their religious leaders and pull down their pants on their holiest place on the holiest day of the year and not get punished.\nFrom Josephus, War of the Jews\n\"..when the multitude were come together to Jerusalem, to the feast of unleavened bread, and a Roman cohort stood over the cloisters of the temple, (for they always were armed and kept guard at the festivals, to prevent any innovation which the multitude thus gathered together might make,) one of the soldiers pulled back his garment, and cowering down after an indecent manner, turned his breech to the Jews, and spake such words as you might expect upon such a posture. At this the whole multitude had indignation, and made a clamour to Cumanus, that he could punish the soldier... \"\nSure, they weren't the most tolerant bunch, but they had reason to rebel.\n\n\nIV.'...As we all know by now, if there is one thing that Jewish Supremacist Zealots hate more than an \"anti-Semite\", it's a \"self-hating Jew.\" Jesus of Nazareth had to go.'Jews did not kill Jesus. This has been indicated by people like the Catholic Church or the Lutheran Church. The Romans would of had great interest in killing him to his gaining of a large following. In fact, he himself was offered the opportunity to deny the charge of \"King of Jews\" but refused, placing the blame at his feet.\n\n\nTLDR: What is wrong with people?\n ",

        "text": "I came across [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6k3ond/my_mil_tried_to_baptize_my_son_in_secret/djjbv50/) recently, and it's incorrect. This person says that infant baptism started in Europe during the Black Death, which is incorrect - infant baptism is much much older than that. \n\nPOST DONE.\n\nNo, I'm kidding. They're incorrect, but I think there's much more interesting things to talk about than strictly whether or not they're correct. The more interesting question to me is how we know they're incorrect, and what history of traditions like baptism actually is. I think there's a long and illustrious tradition of making fun of people who use religious texts to talk about literal history, but it's important to remember that religious texts can and do tell us quite a lot about history, even if we sometimes have to read between the lines to do it.\n\nTake, for instance, infant baptism. \n\nWe know for a fact that Christians have been baptising infants since at least the 3rd century because [Tertullian complained about it](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0321.htm), saying that children shouldn't be baptised because they had nothing to forgive and were putting whoever spoke on their behalf at risk. Origen also references infant baptism at about the same time, arguing that since even infants are baptised, adults should see baptism as a solution for original sin. \n\nIt's possible and likely that infant baptism took place before the 3rd century as well. Writers like Origen refer to much older verses like John 3:5 as the origin (heh) of the tradition, meaning that it was likely going on before Origen arrived on the scene. Depending on how one interprets Acts, this book can be read as advocating for infant baptism. Acts 2:39 and Acts 16:15 both explicitly reference a \"household\" or \"children\" being baptised. Given that a Roman household included children, this could be interpreted as referencing children, but this view will depend on the particular reading you have of the verses. Personally, I'm sceptical, but in the spirit of due diligence, I'm including it here. \n\nWhat I find interesting about this question of when this tradition started, though, is not blatant historical record. This is a random tradition in a small religion, at least in the beginning, and those sorts of things tend not to be recorded. What's really interesting is how we know so much about how old this tradition is. That method is one we can use for a lot of different questions to learn about history, even when it's not explicitly stated. \n\nLet's go back to my two examples from the beginning, Tertullian and Origen. Both men were writing at about the same time, but represent diametrically opposing ideas of what Christianity, Christ, and God are. At the risk of going too deep into theology, Tertullian was very much a materialist, believing in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three separate entities; Origen saw them all as one entity. Tertullian saw souls as coming into being with a person; Origen saw souls as pre-existing a person. Tertullian saw sin as being inherent to body; Origen saw it as inherent to the soul (to simplify his views). You get the idea, though. \n\nThey don't have a tendency to write specifically about infant baptism because it tends not to be of interest to them. The bit I took from Tertullian is about why baptism is important and what it signifies, namely, the washing away of the bodily sin. Origen is writing more specifically about the importance of baptism in renewing the soul, with babies being a tangent on that. Their interest is in what baptism signifies as a rite and as part of Christian orthopraxy, with babies serving as examples of why a practice exists, rather than as the reason for writing in and of themselves. Origen and Tertullian don't care about babies - they care about establishing their own particular views of Christian belief as dominant. It just so happens that through their arguments, we can learn a lot about what Christians were doing at any given time.\n\nYou can find these sorts of historical nuggets all through religious texts, where the examples people use to make their arguments, or the references that are made tell a lot about what people were doing, or what their general worldview was. One of my favourite examples of this is dating the Gospels based on prophecies about the destruction of the Temple. Mark 13, for instance, goes into great detail (relatively speaking) about the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, something which took place in 70CE. That, coupled with the general apocalyptic tone of the book, make it likely that it was being written at about the time the Romans were burning the city down. It definitely wasn't Mark's *intention* to communicate what it was like to live in Jerusalem with a bunch of angry Romans, but because that's the lens through which Mark chose to write about Jesus, we can learn a lot about Jewish apocalypticism in Jerusalem around 70CE. There's a ton of examples of things we can learn from reading between the lines, and I really could go on forever, but you get the idea. \n\nUltimately, my point is that twofold. First, babies have been baptised forever - this didn't start in medieval Europe. Second, the reason we know this is fantastic. People in the past, much like people now, used their experiences and the world around them to make arguments about metaphysical and spiritual things. From their arguments and from what they chose to use to make those arguments, we can learn so much about their world and what it was filled with. Personally, I love that, and I love how much information there is in these sorts of texts, even if you have no interest whatsoever in the theological elements.\n\nSources!\n\n- I used the NIV Bible, if you want to check my quotes and debate my interpretations.\n\n- I didn't get into him because he's not as interesting as Origen and Tertullian, but [Hippolytus of Rome](http://www.bombaxo.com/hippolytus.html) also writes about baptising babies around the 3rd century.\n\n- Baptism in the Early Church by Everett Ferguson\n\n- Tertullian quotes are from [here](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0321.htm)\n\n- The Narrative Function of the Temple in Luke-Acts, Ronald C. Fay (and if you're interested in learning more about the role of the Temple in the Gospels, do let me know, because it's fantastic in dating the Gospels, determining authorship, and just generally looking at how the different Gospel authors saw themselves and Jesus)\n\n- [This is very important research.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qw6Hon013E)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6mgh6v/pennsylvania_was_anarchocapitalist_mind_asplode/",
        "text": "So I was debating with an Ancap on Reddit (having nothing better to do with my time) and during the debate he brought up 17th-century Pennsylvania as an example of an anarcho-capitalist society. Needless to say I was intrigued. He sent me the following link, which is an excerpt from Murray Rothbard's *Conceived in Liberty*, in which he presents an anarcho-capitalist interpretation of American history:\n\nhttps://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard81.html\n\nAs interesting as the \"Holy Experiment\" seems, I fail to see how it is an example of anarcho-capitalism. It seems to me more like an example of state capitalism gone wrong. Penn received Pennsylvania as his own private property from none other than Charles II. Penn encouraged immigrants to flock to his new lands, hoping to turn it into a Quaker utopia. They repaid him by rebelling and refusing to pay the rent and taxes which they owed to him as owner of the land. To claim this as an example of successful anarcho-capitalism is like saying that the kulaks in the Soviet Union killing their livestock proves the success of Stalinism. Furthermore, as this documentary (In Penn's Shadow (1680-1720) - Philadelphia: The Great Experiment) explains, the colony had slavery, which necessitated the institution of the state to exist (15:25):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-31iitsBAh0\n\nNone other than Murray Rothbard states:\n\n&gt;In the vast stretches of America, William Penn envisaged a truly Quaker colony, \"a Holy experiment...that an example may be set up to the nations.\"\n\n&gt;In his quest for such a charter, Penn was aided by the fact that the Crown had owed his father, Admiral Sir William Penn, the huge sum of 16,000 pounds for loans and back salary. In March 1681 the king agreed to grant young William, the admiral's heir, proprietary ownership of the lands west of the Delaware River and north of the Maryland border in exchange for canceling the old debt.\n\nSo Penn was effectively a capitalist acting under the auspices of the state.\n\nRothbard makes it seem like the colonists did not pay taxes at all, yet according to the Hoover Institution:\n\n&gt;From 1682 to the end of the century, Delaware was joined in legislative union with Pennsylvania under the proprietorship of William Penn. Under his charter, Penn was permitted to tax only with the advice and consent of the freemen in the colony.\n\n&gt;Penn sold land at the incredibly low price of 10 pence per acre down payment with a quitrent of one-fourth penny per acre. The three lower colonies of Delaware that became part of Penn’s original grant from Charles ii attracted Europeans who wished to escape religious wars. The Assembly and Executive Council of Pennsylvania-Delaware financed public services with fines, a tax of a penny per ton on all vessels over 12 tons, and duties of 2 pence per gallon on strong liquor and 1 percent ad valorem on all other goods. Counties were permitted to levy direct property and poll taxes to underwrite roads, bridges, and ferries. Few schools were supported from public funds (yet colonists were subject to fines if children could not read and write by the age of 12).\n\n&gt;On several occasions, the queen demanded that Pennsylvania-Delaware residents contribute men and money to military efforts against Indians in New York. Several taxes were authorized, including a penny in the pound levy on all property, real and personal; those with net estates less than £30 were exempt. Freeman rated under £100 paid a poll tax of 6 shillings. Pennsylvania-Delaware taxpayers never fully met the queen’s requests. A request to provide £350 for the erection of a fort above Albany was refused outright in 1701.\n\nhttp://www.hoover.org/research/colonial-roots-american-taxation-1607-1700\n\nSo although there were occasions when the colonists in Pennsylvania refused to pay tax, and they paid less than they were supposed to, there is no evidence that they paid no tax at all. \n\nRothbard writes:\n\n&gt;If for most of 1684–88 there was no colonywide government in existence, what of the local officials? Were they not around to provide that evidence of the state's continued existence, which so many people through the ages have deemed vital to man's very survival? The answer is no. The lower courts met only a few days a year, and the county officials were, again, private citizens who devoted very little time to upholding the law. No, the reality must be faced that the new, but rather large, colony of Pennsylvania lived for the greater part of four years in a de facto condition of individual anarchism, and seemed none the worse for the experience.\n\nYet this is clearly false, since, as the documentary points out. According to the historian Stephen Nepa (21:04), Philadelphia had the highest incarceration rate of any American colonial city, with lawlessness and deviance running rampant.\n\nAll in all I am not convinced that Pennsylvania can be cited as an example of anarcho-capitalism. The only places where this claim appears are libertarian websites like mises.org. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Rothbard seems to be cherry-picking history to suit an agenda.",

So instead I shall exmaine Deadliest Warrior Season 2, Epsiode 3: Attila the Hun versus Alexander the Great:\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x511mvj\n\nI have an imaginary bottle of Glen Grant single malt whiskey, so let us begin!\n\n0.14: HOLLYWOOD COMBAT SPIN! DRINK!\n\n0.23: The Persian troops are holding their violin shields in the wrong way. They have them horizontal, which means they lose any possible protection to their lower and upper bodies. A second mistake is that Achaemenid infantry used large round or crescent shields by in the 4th century BC, and had not employed those of a violin shape for over a hundred years. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n1.24: The initial introduction of the two warriors takes place. I find that the decision to match them against one another is not sensible. Alexander is fighting as a heavy cavalryman, and Attila is a horse-archer. Such troops used very different tactics and were not comparable at all.\n\n1.32: The narrator describes Attila as \"The notorious raider who ransacked Europe. His murderous missions forever linking his name with cruelty\". Now, one does not become a powerful warlord by comporting like a fluffy puppy, but the Roman historian Jordanes noted that Attila was \"restrained in action, mighty in counsel, gracious to suppliants and lenient to those who were once received into his protection\". Attila was an individual of complex motives, so reducing him to a caricature driven by plunder and blood-lust is imposing a false narrative. DRINK!\n\n1.45: More anachronistic Persian shields. DRINK!\n\n2.41: The handles on that Persian shield are made of plastic, and the techniques of manufacturing this material had been lost with the departure of the Annunaki in 1827 BC. DRINK!\n\n2.58: The first Attila the Hun expert is Robert Borsos. He is an individual who actively practices horse archery, so I will give DW a point for that. Nonetheless, he does not appear to possess the necessary academic background. I must take a shot even though I have immense respect for his skills. DRINK!\n\n3.22: The next is Sean Pennington, who is lauded as being adept with the dagger and spear. There is nothing about this guy on IMDB besides references to two b-grade actors. Nor is there anything showing up in a google search related to ancient history. DRINK!\n\n3.22: Another reference to the \"cruelty\" of Attila. By what standards? Hunnic society? Roman society? Or modern sensibilities projected backwards? DRINK!\n\n4.47: The initial expert on Alexander the Great is Peter Van Rossum. He appears to be a reenactor focusing on the Roman Empire, and this is the extent of his expertise. DRINK!\n\n5.05: The second is 'bladed combat specialist' Kendall Wells. He has an extensive resume on IMDB as an actor, stuntman and writer without any background in history. DRINK!\n\n5.21: The narrator asserts Alexander was from Greece, completely ignoring his Slavic heritage. \n\n5.54: Inaccurate Persian shields. DRINK!\n\n6.15: One of the 'experts' states Alexander the Great was responsible for killing more people than any other conqueror before his time? So more than the Assyrians? Highly doubtful, as Alexander aimed on ruling a coherent and stable empire, and only engaged in massacre against highly recalcitrant tribes in Central Asia. DRINK!\n\n6.50: The ballista, a perfect weapon for a one-on-one duel. \"Attila, could you stand there for half an hour while I get the trajectory for this thing?\"\n\n8.36: \"Dude, I used a siege machine to hit a non-moving target after several shots!\". \"Awesome-dacious, brospeh!\"\n\n9.33: \"Just how lethal is the ballista's flying bolt?\". Well, based on the dummy who had his head completely impaled by a large piece of wood......\n\n11.46: So the counter to a ballista is an.....axe?\n\n11.48: So the exact type of axe they are using is the Scythian axe, or the sagaris. Oooooooone slight problem. The weapon was only used about 900 years *earlier* than the time of Attila. It was common amongst Iranians like the Persians, Medes and Scythians from the 6th century BC onwards, but it had long fallen out of use by 400 AD. Axes during the Migration Period looked like this:\n\nhttps://myarmoury.com/talk/files/dsc01083_114.jpg\n\nOr this:\n\nhttp://poppy.nsms.ox.ac.uk/woruldhord/files/original/7d08bfec57a2a988321ff52413cff20e.jpg\n\nAs opposed to this:\n\nhttps://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Eq1PhbMM--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1878a1ns2s1vpjpg.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n13.34: There is no way in hell Alexander would have worn a helmet like that. He might have worn an Attic helmet:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/59/be/d0/59bed059fbb1c61540f0b54842242516--spartan-helmet-helmets.jpg\n\nor a Phrygian helmet:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/66/7c/30/667c30f3baba85ac48685d6fbb8bc067.jpg\n\nBut not the bizarre monstrosity here. DRINK!\n\n14.23: They need to trademark the term \"Physics for killing\".\n\n14.55: The narrator asserts Attila wore very little body-armour. Now, we have no primary sources that describe what Attila wore, but the ruling classes of steppe societies were the most well equipped and acted as heavy cavalry. The same was probably true for the Huns. As such, Attila probably availed himself of metal scale, lamellar or maille as a sign of his status, and to not die horribly. DRINK!\n\n15.33: They have invited a former UFC fighter to test out the effectiveness of Pankration. The problem here that the modern version has absolutely no connection to the ancient method of combat. There are no surviving schools or tradition to draw on, so the best that can be achieved is to try *guess* how the ancient Greeks fought. Presenting the current techniques as an accurate representation is absolutely dishonest. DRINK!\n\n19.55: Incorrect Persian shield. DRINK!\n\n20.01: Now they are matching the Hunnic composite bow with the gastrophetes. The problem with this was the gastrophetes was never a common battlefield weapon in the 4th century BC. A better choice would be to use a sling or an Scythian-style composite bow, which were far more common. DRINK!\n\nAnd that is the end of that. See you for Part 2!\n\nSources\n\nBy the Spear: Philip II, Alexander the Great, and the Rise and Fall of the Macedonian Empire, by Ian Worthington\n\nThe Composite Bow, by Mike Loades\n\nThe Origin and Deeds of the Goths, by Jordanes: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14809\n\nThe Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China 221 B.C. to AD 1757, by Thomas Barfield \n\nThe Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28587\n\nShadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War, by Kaveh Farrokh\n\nWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900, by Guy Halsall\n",
