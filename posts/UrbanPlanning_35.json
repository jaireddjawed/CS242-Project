They're not hit with powerful hurricanes often, but when they are, storms like Hurricane Sandy knocked out power to millions simply because all the lines are above ground. That's not to mention how ugly they are on top of everything else. What's getting in the way of these areas gradually burying their lines?",

        "text": "I realize that most discussions about suburbs deal with the issue of the typical low density suburbs of North America. I wonder if other countries have the issue of high density, high end buildings built in suburbs.\n\nAs the picture shows, several high end apartment buildings next to the BRT line. In Curitiba, zoning regulations mean that these taller buildings can only be placed next to the city BRT, and height decreases accordingly.\n\nAs for the neighborhood in the picture, only a few who live in those buildings are likely to use the BRT. These are very expensive apartments and their owners usually have more cars than members of the household. Due to cultural reasons, Brazilians prefer apartments than \"McMansions\".\n\nTwo observations: A majority of luxury apartments built next to the BRT is particular of that neighborhood. Usually, the constructions built next to the BRT are middle class. Second is that the city has a relatively high income, favorable geography, and did not face the mass migration that caused the appearance of favelas such as the ones in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. While there are favelas, they were urbanized and are far \"less extreme\".\n\nEdit: the picture did not upload:\nhttps://reddit-uploaded-media.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/images%2Ft2_i3fas9m%2Fqy4tb0mthku01\n\nEdit2: Middle class neighborhood with equivalent buildings next to the BRT line. These constructions have already been finished.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ca8xxh2\n\nCity equivalent of a favela:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GdR9Ydm\n\nEdit3: Allowed height is related to proximity to the BRT lines:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/H5aGeyV\n\nBonus: Institute responsible for the world first BRT system (I guess):\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QhPUU5L\n\nAnd the city trinary road system:\nhttp://www.ippuc.org.br/rede/arquivos_projetos/10%20BRT%20BUS%20RAPID%20TRANSIT//10%2023.jpg",

        "text": "I don't know if this is the correct place to post this, but it seems to be the best fitting subreddit for this post.  \n\nBasically, I've been lately reading a good amount of the [Urbanophile](http://www.urbanophile.com/) and the [New Geography](http://www.newgeography.com/) and both have focused a lot on the emergence of the superstar cities, cities that are nearly hegemonic when it comes to the domination of an industry and their tendency to draw elites and company headquarters to their borders and away from smaller and less global cities.  This is easily illustrated with the effect New York City had on [St. Louis' advertising industry](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/maraprmay-2016/the-real-reason-middle-america-should-be-angry/) where over time advertising agencies moved to NYC and were consolidated into NYC based firms at which point the focus became more about maximizing profits and cost cutting measures occured, hurting St. Louis while enriching NYC based people.  Or look at Caterpillar deciding to move its headquarters from [Peoria to the Chicago area](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-caterpillar-st-0420-20170419-story.html).  \n\nIs this a good thing, is this new wave of consolidation benefiting more Americans than when headquarters were more spread out across the nation?  I'm doubtful because wealth consolidation levels are the [most unequal they've been in the past 50 years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/06/the-richest-1-percent-now-owns-more-of-the-countrys-wealth-than-at-any-time-in-the-past-50-years/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5bbb52562d9c) of American history, implying that the profits made in these superstar cities aren't flowing back out to the country's hinterland to benefit people.  And [exurbs and suburbs](http://www.newgeography.com/content/005823-suburbs-exurbs-grab-nearly-all-metropolitan-growth) see the largest share in population growth and city cores the lowest, so it's not like the superstar cities' populations are booming in proportion with the amount of wealth they generate so that people are moving closer to the centers of wealth production.  \n\nI'm not advocating for a forcible dispersal of sections of industry across the country; the superstar cities that attract company headquarters and elites have out-competed their rivals and are reaping the benefits of their fitness, but as I've read more about the superstar effect, I'm increasingly doubtful that it's actually beneficial for the average person.  \n",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I am a layperson with interest in good urban planning, not an expert.\n\nI feel like we've reached a critical point in time where mass/public transit and walkability are coming into favor as our cities grow. By making the choice to live and/or work in dense areas, many Americans are signaling that they are okay with, or even in favor of forgoing a commuter car and using transit instead.\n\nSo, now cities must expand their public transit to meet the new demand.\n\nI see lots of people talk about rail, but I feel that rail has too many drawbacks to be a viable option and that cities should focus instead on expanding their bus service.\n\n***\n\n**Rail Pro**\n\n* Is sexy\n\n* Can haul a very large number of passengers \n\n* More environmentally friendly to operate a train than a diesel bus. \n\n* Fixed infrastructure implies that the municipality will continually offer service and therefore encourages investment near rail stops. \n\n* Trains have a longer service life than busses. \n\n**Rail Con**\n\n* Rail infrastructure must be built before a single train can run. So it has massive upfront costs. \n\n* Rail infrastructure is extremely expensive to build in the US, so it would be too expensive to cover everything and everyone. \n\n* Trains can't go up a steep hill. \n\n* Trains and Rail cars are more expensive than busses. \n\n* Rail service must cross roadways, which can cause a safety hazard or add potential for delays (I rode the light rail in Charlotte, NC and a train was delayed 40 minutes due to a car accident that happened at a crossing and was blocking the train from moving. There was no notification until the train was already 15 minutes late). \n\n* Fixed infrastructure means a lack of flexibility. Trains can only run on their particular track. \n\n***\n\n**Bus Pro**\n\n* The road infrastructure required for bus service already exists. Additional infrastructure needed for expansion of bus service (curb-cut and structure for new stops, new roads) is minimal.\n\n* Busses are less expensive than trains.\n\n* Since the infrastructure mostly already exists and busses themselves are relatively cheap, service can begin immediately and can be rolled out over time with a series of small investments (relative to rail). \n\n* Busses can go up steep hills. \n\n* Busses can be rerouted (in my previous example about Charlotte's rail, a bus can simply drive around an accident or, at worst, take a different street).\n\n* Busses can be reassigned to handle major events (for example, on a Sunday (which is normally slow), busses can converge on the football stadium to handle people coming and going, as opposed to rail which is fixed in place and can't be rerouted to serve a special event.)\n\n**Bus Cons**\n\n* Busses aren't sexy (and maybe we need a propaganda campaign to change people's minds about this). \n\n* Busses have to share the road with commuter cars (but there are ways to arrange roadways to favor busses over cars).\n\n* Lack of bus-specific infrastructure doesn't guarantee continuous service, which doesn't encourage investment near stops, unlike rail.\n\nIt seems to me that rail is exorbitantly expensive to even get started, whereas busses already have almost all necessary infrastructure in place. Add to that the fact that busses are much more flexible in where they are able to go (up a hill, on a different road/route) and busses just seem like the way to go.\n\nI will concede that rail *does* have use and should be considered, but only for longer range and high-capacity routes.\n\nAm I wrong here?",
