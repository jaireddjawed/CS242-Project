Just for context. My wife and I both work from home, so we pretty much depend on our connection.\n\nMonday March 6th, 12 pm: internet goes out, light goes red. I call them, they tell me it should be fixed within 48 hrs. I don\u2019t love it but that\u2019s ok. I Can figure it out for a couple of days.\n\nWednesday March 8th: I call them a couple of times and they tell me they should be here today. By 3:30 pm they arrive, nonchalant technician tells me that my issue needs to be fixed by someone else. Says they\u2019ll try to be here that same day, if not it won\u2019t get past Thursday. I\u2019m staring to get angry but what can you do?\n\nThursday March 9th: I call them at 9 am to see at what time they will be here, a representative says they have it scheduled for 12 pm at the latest.\n\n12:30 - obviously no one shows and no one calls. I call them, that apologize and say they\u2019ll be here at 4.\n\n4:15 - same old, no showing, no call. I call yet again and they apologize again and assure me they\u2019ll come before 6.\n\n5:50 - silence again, I call for the fourth time. A rep apologizes, says they\u2019ll come Friday. By this time I\u2019m furious, I go full Karen and ask for a manager. Manager gives me yet another apology. I ask if they are lying or just incompetent. He gives me a personal guarantee that they will come on Friday. I log off from the situation and watch some forgotten dvds (been using streaming only for a while).\n\nFriday March 10th (today): I call at 9 am to see at what time are they planning to arrive. They put me on hold. They tell me that my ETA for fixing is 24 hours. I snap, I call their biggest competitor. They say they will come set me up today.\n\nWho arrives first? We\u2019ll see.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for all the kind comments and suggestions! I Definitely feel better than I did all week. Here\u2019s what happened next:\n\nFriday 1 pm: competitor arrives, they start setting up, guy even notices other company\u2019s router and asks about it, so I obviously share the story.\n\nAbout 45 min later, original company arrives to fix (without calling first, which they assured me they\u2019d do). Apparently they didn\u2019t even need to enter my apartment, so I let them in and they get to work in the building, where all the connections are. During a simultaneously awkward and glorious 30 min, I\u2019m standing there watching both parties working side by side. \n\nOriginal internet gets fixed, new internet guy asks me if I\u2019m keeping both. I tell him that I won\u2019t. New company offered better price and better speed (plus a couple of friends have told me they have better service).\n\nA bit later new company finishes. I now have 2 routers (until I cancel the original one which is paid until the 22nd). Things finally appear back to normal!\n\nThank you all so much for reading.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678474563.0},{"title":"Cashier from the gas station followed me home.","author":"berrylife","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/11lcywy\/cashier_from_the_gas_station_followed_me_home\/","text":"Bought a pack of cigs at the gas station and the cashier gave me my change with the cigs.\n\nI tossed everything in my purse and left, to go back to the house.\n\nMind you, this isn\u2019t even my house, I\u2019m just here hanging out for a few hours.

I feel vindicated in not having complied with the unreasonable ultimatum I was given. In retrospect, I probably just should have walked out. Many have mentioned that the cashier should have stepped in. There was a bit of a language barrier, and I don\u2019t think he had the ability to explain well. I did end up calling and was able to explain the situation to her superior. She was very kind and apologized for the experience. She told me that they never have the customer get back in line in those situations, and that I should have been allowed to grab the other chair. She did say that she was going to document the situation, and have a talk with the woman to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. All is well now. Thanks for the solidarity! \n\nSo today I went to a thrift store in search of a couple chairs for my breakfast nook. I found the perfect fit for my space\u2014brand new chairs, and lucky for me, 50% off of all green tags (the tags were green, woo!) I grabbed two chairs of the three available, and headed up to the register. When the cashier went to ring up my purchases, he could only find a tag on one of the chairs. He was very concerned about this, and told me that sometimes chairs are sold in pairs and wanted to be sure about it before he rang me up for two. I told him that I was pretty sure that they were being sold individually, because there were three available for sale and they all had separate tags on them. (My guess is the tag for the second chair fell off somewhere when I made my way up to the register.) Anyways, the man wasn\u2019t comfortable with just ringing me up for two and insisted that he check with his supervisor first. So we waited. And waited. My three year old was losing his patience, flopping his body this way and that in the cart, asking when we were going to get out of there. The line behind me was piling up, and people were staring at me impatiently, like I was the one causing the hassle. We continued to wait. The man at the register called for backup cashiers, but the line had gotten LONG after waiting for such a while.\n\nThe supervisor finally arrived, clearly already irritated. The cashier asked her if the chairs were sold as a set or separately. Then she looked at me as if I was the one asking, and scoffed, \u201cThey are sold SEPARATELY. We can\u2019t give you two chairs for the price of one. Do you still want them?\u201d And then I said, politely, \u201cYes, I do, thank you.\u201d Then she stared at me blankly for a second, and said, \u201cI also can\u2019t give you the 50% off the chair without the tags. You\u2019ll have to pay full price for that one.\u201d I was starting to get a bit flustered at this point\u2014my kid was having a meltdown, the line behind me was getting longer, people were staring, and the lady was just being mean. So I replied, still a bit confused, \u201cSo you\u2019re not able to just scan the other tag twice? If it\u2019s really a problem, there\u2019s a third chair I can grab that does still have the tags on and I can switch it out for that one.\u201d I pointed towards the chair, which was just an aisle away from where we were and would have taken less than 30 seconds to grab and be back to the register. The woman paused for a moment, then looked me dead in the eye, and said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that. You can either pay full price for this one right now, or you can go get the other one and take it to the end of the line.\u201d At this point, I was so overwhelmed that I wanted to cry. We had already waited such a long time. So I pathetically pleaded, \u201cReally?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes. So are you going to pay full price or go get the other one and get back in line?\u201d At that point, I was so anxious and overwhelmed that my mind was jelly, but my subconscious wasn\u2019t going to be bullied into paying full price for an item that was on sale, or be pushed into waiting in a line that I had already waited in. \n\nI didn\u2019t answer her. I took my cart, walked over to the chair that still had the tags on, and took it back to the cashier. The woman stared me down as I approached again, but she didn\u2019t say anything further. The cashier had begun helping someone else just before I returned (who frustratingly had a full basket of items and needed to look at a bunch of things in the jewelry case, which made my time in that store even longer).\n\nAfter an unnecessary amount of time, my son and I finally made it out of there. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when I got into the car. I tend to be emotionally triggered when I feel like I\u2019m being treated unfairly. That and I was in the prodromal stages of a migraine attack, which later became full-blown. From my standpoint, I really feel like I was treated unfairly, and I feel like other people would be in agreement. But maybe my judgement is clouded?

I've been there. I've been a cashier, delivery girl, and food runner at my old fast food job. I know what it's like to not get a tip. BUT, I never, *ever,* asked straight to the customer's face, \"You don't want to tip me?\" That is just so uncouth.\n\nAnd what did you do tonight for me and my friend's AYCE sushi night? You brought us our food. The food that we ordered from a TABLET. You barely interacted with us. Hell, the HOST interacted more with us; he at least asked us if the tiny table was fine and helped us out when we thought that our tablet was broken. If I was tipping him, then I would absolutely give. All you did was try to rush us out when we were discussing how to split the bill (listed on the tablet) and asking if we were done. \"Oh no, not yet, I just want one thing of ice cream, and then we'll pay!\" I said.\n\nI get it, at buffets, you don't want customers to loiter and eat all the food. But how are you gonna bring me the bill BEFORE I even get my ice cream? We hadn't even eaten that much; We went through maybe two rounds of food and one cocktail we shared before we felt stuffed. I just wanted one more tiny thing and then we'd be good.\n\nI put it all on my card and my friend paid back her share in cash to me (she's the one who got the cocktail too). I get the card back, fill out the receipt, and just converse with my friend, waiting for the food to digest. They take back the check, we converse some more. My friend's still trying to polish off her cocktail, but she says she can't, so I chug it for her. I got yo back, bestie.\n\nTHEN, the dreaded moment:\n\n\"Excuse me, you didn't leave a tip on the check. You don't want to tip? And also, you forgot to sign the bottom.\"\n\nI WAS SO FLUSTERED YOU GUYS. To be fair, that last part is my fault, but, my friend and I were literally just talking about how we're introverts and this restaurant was great because we don't have to talk too much to the servers. Not to say we're crippled in that sense, but you know, sometimes you just don't feel like socializing with strangers. BUT NOW-\n\nSo I stutter and fumble for a bit before taking out my wallet and fumbling more with the cash my friend just gave me. By the way, the server (*food runner,* not a true \"waitress\" in the sense that she took our orders) is STARING AT ME THE WHOLE TIME. Waiting for what she probably expects to be 20%. In any other situation I probably would have. But 1. I'm struggling right now to get consistent income, I work per diem and only get paid twice a month. Adding to that, I was already freaking out earlier because I lost my debit card somewhere, so I had to pay with a credit card.\n\n2. Our bill came to over $80. It's $30 per person (a change from before inflation, it used to be $25) for AYCE, and my friend's drink came to around $14. Adding tax it came to that. I get it, everyone that night was working hard, it's Saturday night, it's busy as hell. But if I'm gonna tip someone I'd rather do it for a person who A. was super nice and accomodating, and B. actually interacted with me beyond getting me the food. When I was a cashier I never expected tips. When I was a FOOD RUNNER I never expected tips. I would graciously accept when I did, but never did I openly ASK for it.\n\n3. Girl, YOU WERE SUPER RUDE. I'M SORRY BUT YOU WERE. Your tone might have been neutral but you definitely implied I was being scummy for not leaving anything. I did feel a bit bad, up until the part where YOU CALLED ME OUT. Now I'm scared of looking like a dick in front of my friend.\n\nSo I slowly sign the receipt (she's still staring btw) and I reluctantly take out $7. I gave her a *tiny* bit of empathy; maybe she has a quota to meet or whatever, but I sure as hell wasn't giving her 20%. She said thanks and took back the check. My friends straight up told me I should have just given the $5 bill and honestly, I should have. We should have just bounced after they took back the check the first time, though I guess we couldn't have because I had to sign anyway. And I don't know if it was the alcohol I just chugged or the lingering sense of embarassment or both, but I was still fucked up when we got back in my car. Friend and I just watched a video for a bit until we got our bearings.\n\nAm I being overdramatic about this? Yes. But was I justified for initially not intending to tip at all?

Only she cuts it around at a slant. So my right side is like an inch longer than my left side. She asks how it looks. I tell her the right side is too long. Again, she says, \u201cif you part your hair in the middle it\u2019ll be longer on that side.\u201d  And starts trying to move my hair around to show me. I tell her again that I don\u2019t part my hair in the middle. I tell her, \u201cI wear it on the side part, just how I have it, every day. I want it cut so it\u2019s one even length all around.\u201d\n\nShe got really huffy but she did what I asked.

Well For anyone not aware, there is currently a pretty serious shortage of the medication that's been going on for months and only seems to be getting worse. Originally I was prescribed one dosage, but that stopped being in stock months ago so they altered my size of the pills but kept me at the same daily dosage, just need to take more pills. Well starting in October this dosage size also started to be hard to find, and the pharmacy I normally use ran out and my doctor told me they don't have time to look around, so to call around until I found somewhere that had it and they could send my script there. Called around, found a place, no worries.\n\nFast forward to January and my stock was out again, but it was much worse and I was told to call different pharmacy chains. So I tried wallyworld and other box stores, until I call my nearby location that sounds like VHS, and told the pharmacist that I was calling to see stock of a medication. The guy is clearly annoyed but asks for my patient info, I tell him I have not used them before and I just need to see if they have stock first and then my doctor will send my prescription. He gets really cagey but says ok what medication, I tell him my Adderall dosage and he absolutely flies off the handle. \"UM SIR, THAT IS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AND FOR MY SAFETY  I WILL NOT EVER DISCUSS CONTROLLED STOCK OVER THE PHONE!\"\n\nRight away I'm taken back, I have called dozens of different pharmacies during this shortage and not once has someone acted like that was weird. I stay calm and respond \"Okay... I'm just confused as my doctor told me to call you guys and I've called other places with no issue..\" and he snaps back \"WELL AGAIN FOR OUR SAFETY I WILL NEVER EVER DISCUSS CONTROLLED STOCK WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN A DOCTOR, NOT JUST ANY JOE SHOPPING AROUND FOR DRUGS!! DOES THAT NOT SOUND REASONABLE TO YOU!?\"\n\nSo I'm just like okay man idk what to tell ya, I was told to call you by my doctor and you're the only one acting like this, but nevermind. I immediately call the other nearby VHS location and ask them their stock, not only does he give me the exact amount he has, he gives me sock amount of the first location I called, as well as when they get deliveries in to help my odds of finding some LOL. He said it was crazy what I experienced at the first place, and how its extremely common for people to call for medication inventory and especially Adderall due to the shortage. Good news is he said he'd let upper management know because that's not okay for him to freak out as he needs to be able to tell people these things.\n\nEDIT: One quick edit for clarification I did not ask for the specific amount they have in stock, I can understand why that would not be able to be answered (though ironically I have had several pharmacies give me their exact amount, especially when they had some but not enough to fully fill my prescription). I simply asked if they had my medication \"in stock\" to be filled.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677720616.0},{"title":"Would be theft for me, but not for thee?","author":"TontosPaintedHorse","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/11falap\/would_be_theft_for_me_but_not_for_thee\/","text":"I went to a gas station yesterday in my smaller\/mid-size Texas town. I bought 2 cans of tobacco and a Gatorade totaling $16, and paid using my debit card.\n\nThe total was not displayed on the card reader, and when the clerk pulled and looked at the receipt he made a funny face before offering it to me. As he handed it he said he accidentally charged me $116 instead of $16.\n\nI acknowledged the mistake and politely asked him to just put it back on the card. He immediately told me he couldn't do that and started explaining to me how I could recover the money he overcharged me. He said he'd give me the receipt with the overcharge and a corrected one and write a note on it and I could go down to my bank and explain it and they'd give me $100.\n\nNow... I'm not a businessperson at all, frankly, but this didn't seem like the best option to me. I couldn't get him to accept that his plan wouldn't work so I called my bank and had to put them on speakerphone so they could tell him the same thing. Bank said if we couldn't resolve it I could file a dispute once the charge came through but I'd have to cancel my card and jump through hoops.\n\nI asked the clerk to call the owner and he immediately told me the owner is busy and doesn't have time to talk. I asked him to simply give me a $100 gas credit or cash instead. There were immediate \"buts\" to all of the solutions I offered.\n\nBefore I got off the phone with the bank rep I asked if I needed a police report to prove what happened and of course they said \"we don't have to have one but it's helpful.\" So I said loudly so the clerk would hear me, as I had walked away to verify identity with my bank... \"Ok, I'm going to see if I can get the manager\/owner to resolve the issue and if I can't I will call the police and make a report.\" I didn't want to go to that extreme, but also didn't want to leave without my $100!\n\nThe clerk then had a new plan. He said the owner would be there in the morning and I could just come by and get my money then. He was still refusing to even attempt to call the owner so I called the police non-emergency line.\n\nKeep in mind that the conversation between the clerk and I all this time had been civil. I have lots of patience and simply dont like confrontation. The clerk just seemed to want to ignore the reality of the situation, that the business had \"taken\" my money and was refusing to give it back despite me offering several alternatives to resolve. I chose the word \"take\" carefully when I tried to sum up the situation in a simpler way because I had no desire to escalate or call it theft. He kinda seemed surprised, saying defensively \"I didn't *take* your money.\" \n\nI explained the situation over the phone and the PD dispatch said it wasn't a criminal matter, but a civil matter between the business and I.\n\nI then asked if it would be a criminal matter if I took $100 worth of items off the shelves and walked out with them and she said it would. I, flabbergasted, let out a sigh and thanked her for her time. Not trying to make this a police bashing thing, but wtf? \n\nThe clerk then says \"I can try to call the owner,\" walks 4 feet from the register and dials the number of the owner, which was written on the wall.

I knew it would be pricey - it ended up being just under $500 for two 80 minute massages - but I know the service is fantastic and it was what she wanted and deserved!\n\nThe massages were indeed amazing and the facilities were everything you\u2019d expect them to be for that sort of thing. We were really enjoying ourselves and went to lounge by the heated pool. We decided to order some food, which you can do by calling room service. The room service menu is pretty limited, but nice. \n\nHere I have to explain that my sister and I are both gluten free (medical, not personal choice) and she has additional allergies. We are both also lifelong vegetarians, although this is no longer really an issue in our country or in places like the States or the UK. \n\nWe are extremely aware that this makes us very annoying diners and we both avoid eating out because it\u2019s often a bit of a headache. When we do, we both try very hard to limit questions or requests, and to be satisfied with whatever a place can do to accommodate us, even if it means just having a plain old side salad as a main. We have both worked extensively in customer service (I have waitressed specifically) and know how it goes, so we try as hard as we can to be nice and as not demanding as possible. \n\nUpon looking at the menu, I saw they had a GF Mac and Cheese (this is extremely rare and super exciting so I nearly didn\u2019t believe it!) and a sandwich on GF bread that looked tasty. My sister wasn\u2019t quite as easy, but saw a salad she could have. She also wanted to inquire about corn vs. flour tacos and if she could have a certain side. \n\nMy sister made the call and prefaced it by apologising that we would have some questions. She first asked if the Mac and cheese was actually GF and the girl on the phone said yes so I was thrilled! That and my sandwich ordered, that\u2019s me sorted. She then asked if the side she wanted was GF, as it wasn\u2019t noted on the menu, but usually would be (it\u2019s VERY common at least where we live for things to not be noted as such when they are). The girl asked her to hold, but she didn\u2019t actually but the call on hold, instead just put the receiver down. My sister heard some shuffling and background talk, and then the following occurred:\n\nGirl (muffled but clear, in our local accent): well this lady is asking for so much bullsh*t! (Then after picking up the phone in a customer service, non regional accent) Hello!!\n\nSister: (still cheerful, but quite surprised) Wait, am I the lady? \n\nGirl (pretending not to hear her): hello? Hello?\n\nSister (less cheerful): seriously, am I the lady asking for so much bullshit?\n\nGirl: click.\n\nMy sister was very upset and hurt and wanted to just not order food or anything else, but I decided we should call the front desk and discuss it. My reasoning for doing this is that a) we deserve to be able to ask a couple questions without rudeness and b) this resort is a famous rep of our country and the type of tourists they cater to would not tolerate this - this sort of attitude is getting more common in customer service here and it sucks. I work in tourism and our reputation is important to me. \n\nI called the front desk and asked to speak with a manager, the lady who answered said she was one. I explained the situation and she was horrified and said she would investigate. She then asked if we had made our order, and I said no because we were hung up on. She asked if we\u2019d still like to and I said that I was rather hungry but was concerned about any kind of pushback from the girl in question. She asked who I had spoken to and I told her I didn\u2019t have a name, but it was a (probably) young woman of our nationality. I also explained it may be difficult to take our order as we still had a couple questions and didn\u2019t want to trouble her, and she said she wouldn\u2019t know the answers but was more than happy to find out. I explained our order and asked one question, and she said she\u2019d call back. \n\nFive minutes later the phone rang and the lovely front desk lady informed me that the GF Mac and cheese didn\u2019t exist and my sisters question was a negative. She offered a alternate to the Mac, which I declined (still had the sandwich!) and took my sisters new order. This phase was not without its issues, as she didn\u2019t know the menu - but I expected this and kept asking her to please stop apologising as she was going above and beyond. She said she\u2019d call again and please stay by the phone.\n\nShe called back soon after and said she had investigated the situation. As follows:\n\nManager: I have spoken to the girl in question and she says that she wasn\u2019t speaking to your sister but venting her frustration over the chefs not being able to accommodate her questions. However, this is not an excuse for profanity, and it is a resort policy that staff not use profanity on property for any reason, and for that I apologise. This is an awful situation for you and I\u2019m sorry she used profanity with your sister. \n\nMe: I appreciate your apology and your efforts to resolve the issue! However I wish to make clear that my complaint is not her use of profanity, I myself swear like a sailor and that alone wouldn\u2019t bother me at all. My concern is that what you have said isn\u2019t what happened. I completely understand that may be what she said, or what you need to tell me, but I want to make clear my concern was feeling and not the phrasing, as it upset my sister a lot. \n\nManager: I completely understand and I apologise again, I really don\u2019t want you to feel unappreciated.\n\nMe: you have done all you can and I know how these things go, thanks again for your efforts and apology! \n\nShe then asked to speak to my sister, and apologised to her. My sister explained how hard it is for us to order food sometimes and how badly we feel, but it was really upsetting to be spoken about like that. She then thanked the manager, who told her the food would be there soon and let us know if any further feedback. \n\nThe food arrived about 30 minutes later, mine was delicious. My sisters was very good, but not overly filling for a nursing mum. No one\u2019s fault at all! We were given a 15% discount on the food before service charges and grats. The man who brought the food told us the discount was \u2018for not being able to hear us on the phone and disconnecting the call.\u2019 I have been given a greater discount for less fraught issues, but I was pleased to be accommodated and ultimately would not have cared discount or not since the manager made it clear she was concerned. \n\nMy boyfriend seemed to think I had made a big fuss over the whole thing. That being said, he always thinks I make a fuss even if I simply ask if something can be GF if it\u2019s not noted. My sister is still upset and feels like we deserved to say something, but it wasn\u2019t worth it. I feel confident in what I said, but I wish I had explained to the manager that I too work in customer service and I too complain to colleagues about my guests ALL the time - I just make sure they don\u2019t know about it. I have no issue with the girl in question complaining about us (I\u2019m sure it happens all the time, no matter how polite we are), but us hearing it isn\u2019t great. \n\nAlso, I wonder if my elaborating that I didn\u2019t care about profanity but did care about the real issue came across how I intended it (I\u2019d never complain just about someone swearing, and especially not directly to me) or if it came across as me just being nit picky, which I didn\u2019t wish to be. \n\nThoughts? Karen or nah? \n\n*note - I only refer to her as the \u2018girl\u2019 because the manager did. I originally called her a woman, but I never saw this woman, and for all I know she really is a girl. It\u2019s very common for us to refer to someone even my age (29) as a \u2018girl\u2019 so it\u2019s not a big thing, but I know it is in some cultures. Also, I only made note of her using our local accent because it is clear she wasnt speaking to my sister. My sister sounds somewhat American, I sound more \u2018local\u2019, and the girl used a very customer service version of our accent with my sister, as did the manager with me until she realised I was local, when she then switched to a stronger accent. This is normal for us in any interaction, but it strongly shows to me that the girl definitely didn\u2019t know my sister was listening and also let\u2019s me suspect we would have been treated differently (better or worse, not sure) if we were tourists or not local.\n\nExtra note - I accidentally posted this to r\/talesfromthefrontdesk, not even sure how!

I was at the supermarket with my mom. We went through the whole store and I kept asking my mom for all kinds of snacks and sweets. She repeatedly said no. At the end of our visit, we went to the deli section. They mostly have meats and cheeses, but they also have stuff like potato salad or tuna salad. They also rotate things seasonally and this time, they had chocolate pudding. I knew this was my chance. If I could order the pudding before my mom had a chance to say no, the worker would have to give it to me right? They sold the pudding by the pound and I decided that I needed an entire pound. I knew I had to speak quick once they called my mom's ticket, so I got the sentence in my head ready to go \"pound of pudding!\". I kept repeating it in my head. Once they called my mom's number, I walked up to the counter and waited for the worker to greet my mom. Just as my mom was about to order, I cut it and screamed \"POUND OF PUDDING!\". The worker was shocked, my mom was shocked, and I was shocked. I didn't mean to yell. I just wanted to say it quickly, but I guess I got a little excited and screamed at the top of my lungs. The worker stared at me and then bursted out laughing. My mom also started dying laughing and I did the same shortly after. My mom looked at me and said \"Fine, you can have the pudding.\" It was the best day of my life. Finally I would have my pudding. The worker put it in the little container while still chuckling. She even gave me a little spoon so I could eat it in the car on the way home. And oh did I eat it in the car. By the time we got home, there was only a small amount pudding left and my mom looked at my shocked and gasped \"You ate ALL the pudding?! That was a whole pound of pudding!\". I just shrugged and she told me if I wanted a pound of pudding, I would have to eat the whole pound so she made me finish it in the car while she brought the groceries in. I didn't really understand why I had to eat it all, but now I realize it was because my brother would definitely be jealous that I got a pound of pudding and he got nothing. \n\nI still bring this story up once in a while and it gives us a good chuckle.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677687809.0},{"title":"Make me a man Sandwich","author":"Low_Cicada4957","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/11es9mz\/make_me_a_man_sandwich\/","text":"I'm on a computer.

I say stupid because I think to know why this rule is in effect and I respect that. So my apologies to the mods, here's the anonymous version.\n\n*We now return to our original tale...*\n\nWhat's better than standing in line before the tills at the supermarket? Standing there with your girlfriend in tow ;)\n\nLast weekend my gf and me visited a local supermarket which - in my opinion anyway - sells pretty good stuff for very good prices. In fact, this supermarket is one of my favorites; also because they sell genuine German beer (fully committed to the Reinheits gebot!).\n\nBut I digress...\n\n**Standing in line before the till**\n\nWe had a bunch of stuff as well as some beer for the weekend, got in line and we soon noticed that it took quite a while before the line moved, things were unusually slow. Directly before us was an older couple, she was walking with an aid (\"rollator\") and he was also visibly of age: grey hair and the looks. They eventually get to the register and much to everyone's surprise: the cashier asks for their... ID? Obviously this took some time because this is something no adult would expect over here in the Netherlands, let alone a senior citizen!\n\nBehind us were a bunch of students who also saw the whole exchange and it immediately led to some remarks about having to be completely blind if you thought those people were under age. My gf also rolled her eyes when we saw this unfold and told me: \"*I'll handle that*\". I nod back and we put our stuff on the belt.\n\n**Cashier asks everyone for ID?**\n\nWell, sure enough: \"*I will need to see some ID to sell the alcohol*\", the cashier tells me. Not a problem I tell her, my gf will handle that. So I call over to my gf: \"*Honey*... *Aussweiss bitte!*\", and point towards the cashier who is now looking at me with a rather uncomfortable expression while the students behind us start laughing it up.\n\nSo my gf comes over and gives the cashier her ID who is now looking at it with utter confusion on her face. Oh, right, did I forgot to mention? My gf is of Japanese origin and thus has *two* nationalities: Dutch but she also has a Japanese ID, which is the one she just handed to the cashier.\n\nNow, the thing with a Japanese ID is that it contains *a lot* of kanjii (the strange Asian signs?) and if you don't know where to look then... good luck finding what you need.\n\nAfter she took her time staring my gf asked (in English) if there was something wrong...  \"*That's a perfectly valid ID, you know*\", she told the cashier (my gf only talked Japanese & English during this encounter).\n\nNeedless to say it seems the cashier didn't like any of this, she gave the ID back and then asked to see mine to which I told her that she could forget about that idea. After all: it was my girlfriend who was going to pay for our groceries so... obviously *she* needed to show ID, not me.\n\nWell, there was a bit of sputtering to which my gf told her that if she didn't trust our age then she should call for her supervisor: \"*Surely he'll be able to resolve this matter, no?*\", my gf says with a grin on her face: \"*Don't worry, we got time...*\".\n\nAnd with an annoyed look the cashier gave in, my gf paid and with a big grin on her face told the cashier: \"*And thanks for the compliment, I always knew I still looked my 20's*\". For the record: we're in our fifties ;)\n\n***In conclusion...***\n\nNow, I really don't know what was up with all this. Maybe she had a bad day, maybe she felt entitled... I dunno but either way it's *very* uncommon for cashiers to ask older people for ID when they buy alcohol in the Netherlands, this goes double for senior citizens.\n\nAnd because of all that the line went into extreme sizes, right through the middle of the store which is highly uncommon over there.\n\nEither way, I hope she got whatever it was that upset her out of her system and that things go back to normal.\n\nThanks for reading!","upvote_ratio":0.28,"created_utc":1677581972.0},{"title":"Why would the restaurant staff assume that always the man will be paying the bill, not the woman?","author":"Suziethejanitor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/11bxb5y\/why_would_the_restaurant_staff_assume_that_always\/","text":"Bit upset with the always \u2018here you are,sir\u2019\n\nEdit : I\u2019m the woman in this scenario.

We get back to our buddy\u2019s game store and start going through the bag and notice we were missing an entire other forty nuggets. We check the receipt on the bag to make sure we ordered correctly (we had a couple other items as well so the bag didn\u2019t feel **too** light), and we did. So we make a call to the restaurant to inform them of the missing items in hopes that it was either sitting there and the drive thru forgot to give it to us, or they would just make more that we could go get. \n\nThe store answers and tells us to bring the food back with us. That felt weird to me because I was under the impression they couldn\u2019t take food back after it left the premises, but whatever. We put it all back in the bag and make the trip back. We go inside and hand them the bag with the receipt on it, and the manager working there takes it back behind the counter and does something with it.

I messaged the seller to ask if the item was a \"repop\" or if the contents had been inspected. The seller initially responded, but never followed up. The estimated delivery date passed, and the I sought advice on Reddit. I then messaged the seller again and received a response admitting that the kit was likely a fake and offering to cancel the order and issue a refund. However, to the my surprise, the seller shipped the fake kit after the cancellation was requested. I am now wondering if this strategy is an attempt to avoid a bad rating on \\[online auction site\\].\n\n**Normal version**:\n\nHello. I bought a vintage model kit on\u00a0**Jan 27**. I\u2019ve seen crappier specimens go for $2000, but this one was listed for $449.95. The seller looked legit\u2014he allows 30-day returns (seller pays return shipping) and 100% positive feedback.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more suspicious I became. Is it possible that he\u00a0*himself*\u00a0was scammed and is selling a fake item unknowingly? It could be a \u201crepop\u201d\u2014a new kit disguised as a vintage one but worth 1\/10th the value\u2014or worse, a box full of loose plastic bits that sound like a model when you shake it?\n\nSince these kits are sometimes sold as collectibles while still sealed in shrink wrap, many buyers hesitate to open them to examine the contents. This could suggest that the seller may not have known the contents either.\n\nSo after buying, I sent him a message asking if (1) he knew for sure that it was not a repop, (2) if he had inspected the contents, and (3) why the shrink wrap looked so new.\n\nHe responded right away:\n\n>Hi BUYER, you ask very good & pertinent questions. If you don't think it rude of me, it's 11pm and I get up early. I will gladly tell you the story of the kit, previous owner who had quite a large collection and the homework I did on everything before listing it \\~ tomorrow!! If you'd prefer, I would gladly talk via phone about it all.I appreciate your thoroughness and am happy to see that the kit will be in good hands. Chat soon, SELLER\n\nTwo days passed and he never contacted me. So I wrote back on Jan 29, \u201cYes, I\u2019m all ears, please send the info.\u201d\n\nFeb 2, the far-end of the Estimated Delivery date, came and went.\n\nI asked people for advice on reddit. Some people said just open a case for item not received, others said to send one more message.\n\nBy Feb 19 (!), it was obvious that he had attempted a scam, had been caught, and wanted me to just cancel the order rather than fess up. I decided to send an overly polite and naive-sounding message just to see what would happen. Here\u2019s what I sent:\n\n>I hope this message finds you well. It's been 23 days since I purchased the \u201c1961 Aurora #423 Frankenstein Model Kit - Instructions English & French \\~ T710a\u201d from you, and I still have not received it or any update from you regarding its status. I'm starting to get concerned about the situation, and I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an update.  \n>  \n>I understand that you may be busy, but as a buyer, it's important for me to know when I can expect to receive the item or if there are any issues with the order. If you could let me know what's going on, I would greatly appreciate it.  \n>  \n>Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter.\n\nTwo days later, to my shock, he actually responded!\n\n>I greatly appreciate your note and you patience. I sent a couple of messages early on that after some study, the box does not appear to be constructed the same as other 1961 vintage kits. **\\[This is a lie. He never sent any messages.\\]** The exterior is 'printed' onto thinner cardboard stock and does not show on the inside of the bottom lip of the lid. The early original kits have a bit thicker cardboard and the printed exterior paper 'wraps around' and underneath the bottom edge of the lid \\~ extending up a little on the interior of the lid.  \n>  \n>We bought a large collection that did indeed include a good number of original kits along with cases of later era issues. It was the opinion of my lister at the time that these were truly vintage. After looking closely, I am led to believe without hesitation that the kit does not date to 1961. We located instructions from one of these and they were printed in the UK but are very 'white' and clean \\~ again on thin paper \\~ which makes me believe again that it does not date to 1961.  \n>  \n>Please feel free to cancel your order and we will refund the payment immediately.\n\nI read the email\/message last night and couldn\u2019t believe that I got a reply.\n\nToday I got up to cancel the order and, to my utter amazement, right after telling me that it\u2019s a fake, he shipped it.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. This strategy of ignoring me for three weeks, then admitting that it was fake, then telling me to cancel, and then shipping it anyway \u2026 does this combination of actions trigger the \\[online auction site\\] system in some way to make him look better? Because he can now say, \u201cHey! I shipped it! He can\u2019t give me a bad rating?\u201d\n2.

So here's the story of that whole mess.\n\nWe moved in at the end of November. This house is about 100 years old, is a former rental property and has not had much money spent on it. Our boiler is oil fuelled and provides heating and hot water - we have no electric shower units or anything. It's all the boiler.\n\nIn November we had someone come and look at it to help get it working after it had been unused for some time. He said he'd do a service on it but would be away for a few months. We couldn't get anyone else out because it was nearly Christmas. In January we had another company come out to quote for fitting some radiators (not all the rooms had them, because that would have made sense) as part of this they said they would service the boiler. I'll call them 'Company B' \n\nWell, 2 weeks ago (a few days before the radiators are due to be fitted) our boiler broke down. Turns out it hadn't been serviced in at least ten years. Maybe more. We lost heating and hot water.\n\nCue an emergency callout to Company B, as we were already dealing with them. They sent Engineer 1 to take a look. He couldn't do anything and the next day, Engineer 2 came out to check what parts were needed and to order them.\n\nEngineer 3 turned up a few days later to fit the radiators. After fitting 2 of the 3 radiators E3 told us that the third radiator hadn't been ordered and so he obviously couldn't fit it. He did however get the heating back on after a week of not having it, so we were pretty happy. Until then we'd been using two electric heaters for the whole house  which already has a damp problem, and it was getting worse without heating. \n\nStill no hot water though. Turns out they ordered the wrong part, they need some kind of valve but ordered the one for the heating, not the hot water system. \n\nA week passes.\n\nFor two and a half weeks at this point, we've been washing ourselves and the dishes with water boiled in the kettle. Four adults doing this caused our kettle to break yesterday, so we spent \u00a330 on a new one. \n\nWe were told 2 days ago that our radiator, which was meant to be ordered weeks ago, has now been ordered but will not be here until mid march. Which is inconvenient but obviously not our biggest concern, though why they hadn't ordered it before is anyone's guess.\n\nToday Company B sent someone out to finally replace the part in our boiler. \n\nThey have ordered the wrong part. After looking at the boiler several times and sending several engineers, and ordering the wrong part once already. \n\nStill no hot water.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676457152.0},{"title":"Need to find a new salon","author":"goldfishintheyard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/112n7a9\/need_to_find_a_new_salon\/","text":"I had been going to a local salon for years.

We stayed at a hotel overnight before moving and while there I decided to order a bunch of new shampoo bars, soaps, moisturisers etc etc from an eco friendly beauty company I'd bought from before, who were having a sale.\n\nRed flags I blithely skipped past - The company had changed names and when I went to their old website they say this was because they were being bullied\/harassed over orders. Their new website listed products with a third company name on them too. Their ads on facebook are also all marked with 'angry reacts' with comments deleted. \n\nDid I heed this warning? Nay. I was bedazzled by a discount code.\n\nI placed a \u00a320 order (which was down from \u00a335 due to the sale). I was shortly notified of a partial shipment and we moved into our new house, where it would be delivered. Albeit by a courier and not the post office, which was the method I'd paid for at checkout. \n\nMy partial order arrived a few days later, missing like 2 items. I liked the items that had arrived and started using some of them. I was then notified that the sale was now EVEN BETTER, and because our new house was so depressing (mould, rubbish left behind, broken appliances, damp etc) I ordered a little pick-me-up - another \u00a320 ish order.\n\nHere's where I begin to regret my choices.\n\nThe 2 items from my original order never ship. Because there's a strike on at the post office I am slow to start emailing, I give them like two weeks. Then I start asking for my order. I am told a replacement will be sent. Nothing arrives. I am told my items will ship tomorrow. Nothing arrives. I am asked to give them 5 business days. Nothing. Even though they already used a courier on my first order, they are now adamant that this is all to do with the post office. They can only use the post office and the strikes are causing a delay.\n\nDuring this time I am order lots of stuff for the house and it's all arriving within days, including the post office stuff. I tell the company this and they don't have an answer. Not to mention my order hasn't even been dispatched, so how can it be delayed in the post?\n\nMy second order (oh my hubris!) has also not even shipped partially. I placed the order on the 7th of December. \n\nIt is now JANUARY.\n\nI finally receive a dispatch notice on my second order - 2 items are being dispatched. \n\n2 of 9. After over a month.\n\nI email them and tell them this is getting ridiculous. No response. I give them a week before I open a case to get a refund. They send me an email saying 'a replacement is on its way'.\n\nMy 2 items from the second order arrive. Still nothing on the rest of my original order. I email them asking for a refund. The send me the same email as always - 'a replacement is on its way'. At this point I realise they're not even reading my emails. They're just sending the same response to every other email and ignoring the ones in between.\n\nI open a case with all my screenshots (the thread is actually too long to upload fully) and am quickly refunded for both orders (just for the items that didn't arrive, fair). In doing so I notice that their order confirmation for my second order lists 2 of some items when the total suggests I only bought one. But whatever, I get my money back. Who cares at this point.\n\nI later discover that the shampoo bars I ordered are DREADFUL. They don't clean hair at all. I am too tired to be angry at these people anymore.

I have a fairly thick skin, but certain things can really send me over the edge.\n\nI ordered a koi plakat betta fish from a seller online. They had excellent reviews, only a couple bad reviews, but it's extremely rare to find anyone with zero bad reviews. I fully understand that things happen. I had wanted a koi betta for a long time, and the photos from customers showed absolutely beautiful patterns, so that's why I went with them. There is a pet store near me that carries betta, but they've never had any koi variants and I've been going there for years.\n\nI'm no stranger to ordering freshwater fish (also snails) online and having zero issues with the animals that have arrived.\n\nUnfortunately, the fish arrived dead. To start, they had it in a bag of water of course, but there was a really thin layer of bubble wrap around the bag. The styrofoam box they shipped in was way too big for the bag, and the bag had no cushioning to prevent it being jostled too much. Like, of course you have to ship in water, and of course the animal will get bounced around because it's in water, but this fish would have gotten bounced around A LOT. Way more than any fish could handle.\n\nI would just blame the shipping company, however, the seller didn't account for that either. A different seller I've ordered snails from will put them in enough water to survive shipping, plus soaking wet cloth, and with a heat pack or cold pack based on whatever the weather will be in the location they're shipping to. Also significant padding to avoid being tossed around. The fish seller didn't even try!\n\nOn top of that, the poor fish had ich on it. It didn't get the ich from the two day journey to my home. There were a lot of white spots (not shiny scales, actual ich), so it had been present for a while. Who does that? Send someone a sickly fish? If the fish had arrived live, I would have quarantined and treated it for sure, but that's obviously not a possibility.\n\nThe package arrived at 9:45am, and I got the email the package was in our mail lockers right when it was dropped off. The mail lockers where everyone from our complex picks up packages, is indoors and the room is well heated. I get dressed, go down the street to the lockers, get the package, and come back home. Open it up, discover dead fish, take photos. That was at a little after 10:00am.\n\nThe seller's policy was you had to open the package within an hour of arrival, photograph the fish with the bag UNOPENED within that hour, and within two hours write to them so they can refund. I did exactly that.\n\nWhat the seller tried to say was that I had left the package outside for 6 hours, didn't contact them within two hours of delivery, and that the bag in the photo was open. I took multiple photos, and had shared all of them. The bag is clearly CLOSED.\n\nI sent them the photos again, pointed out the timestamp on the photos, sent them the email of the delivery, plus the delivery confirmation from the site to show the package was not sitting outside for 6 hours.\n\nThey finally agreed to refund me.\n\nYes I left a very harsh review about them.\n\nI'm mad for ordering the fish, even though they sent me a sick animal which is their fault. A day after this happened, I saw a review that described something similar to what happened to me. So maybe they were good in the past but have gone down hill since.\n\nOn the bright side, the day this happened, I figured ya know what? I don't care about the koi variant anymore, the tank is cycled and I want a betta fish. That pet store I mentioned at the beginning of this post has some beautiful betta, so I'd rather have a healthy, living, breathing betta than a dead one. I go there and doncha know they have to koi betta, and I chose the one who has a red head, pink body, blue fins and silver speckles. His name is Kingsley, since he's in a planted tank. He's got a great personality and is getting along fine with the ramshorn snails and mystery snails. It took him all of a day to realize I'm the human who brings the food so he gets excited whenever I approach the tank. He's not easily spooked or anything, very active about also well-manner for a male betta. I couldn't be happier. It was a good end to a crappy situation.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675701470.0},{"title":"Don't go putting things in you but just because a random customer tells you it's a good idea.","author":"Rachel_Silver","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/10txmah\/dont_go_putting_things_in_you_but_just_because_a\/","text":"A week ago, I stopped at the fast food joint near my storage unit. While I was waiting for my food, I heard one of the crew members talking about his melatonin habit. He spoke about it enthusiastically; someone else said he had a drug problem, and he said, \"Hell yeah!\"\n\nI chimed in. I told him that melatonin isn't absorbed in the stomach, that it doesn't make it into the bloodstream until it reaches the intestines. Because of that, it takes effect twice as fast and is 30% more effective if you deliver it directly to the intestines by inserting the gummies into the rectum.\n\nNone of that is true. I made it up.\n\nI just stopped in there again, and that guy was working. He was mad at me. It turns out, he tried it, and it didn't work at all.\n\nEDIT: Commenters have accused me of spreading bad medical advice. Allow me to retort.\n\nWhat I said hardly qualifies as bad medical advice. It didn't harm him or put him at risk of harm. It didn't lead him to eschew necessary medical treatment. He didn't spend money on ineffective medications, supplements or devices. He was out the cost of however many gummies he used and had one night when he didn't fall asleep as easily as he had hoped. And he faced embarrassment in front of his coworkers. \n\nI didn't \"spread\" anything. I didn't post it on Facebook or Twitter. I didn't pitch it while appearing on Oprah. I said it to one person. For it to spread, he would have to pass it on to other people, which he didn't do because it didn't work. The only reason he would have passed it on would have been if it HAD worked. But if it worked, I would have been GOOD advice.\n\nI had no idea that guy would take me seriously. I am not a Jedi; I have no supernatural power to make people obey me. He showed no outward signs of being impaired in any way. He is an adult, and is 100% responsible for the decisions he makes and what sources of information he chooses to base those decisions on.\n\nThere is an abundance of bad medical advice in the world. Most of it comes from sources with an agenda. Some people are just trying to gain followers. Some want to increase traffic on a website to increase advertising revenue. \n\nOthers profit a little more directly. Look at the supplement industry; you have Dr. Oz using his credentials and platform to mislead people about the efficacy of products for personal gain. People who follow his advice risk real, lasting harm.\n\nThe guy I talked to made the mistake of believing something outlandish from a total stranger just because I used a couple of big words and managed to say it without laughing. He found out that I was not a reliable source in a way that was unpleasant. That's an opportunity for him to learn a valuable life lesson. Maybe next time he will hesitate before unthinkingly following advice from a stranger. If he doesn't, there was never any hope for him to begin with.","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1675561378.0},{"title":"Your body might look good, but your mouth don't","author":"Shieldmaiden81","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/10tnohk\/your_body_might_look_good_but_your_mouth_dont\/","text":"Just for context, this is a true story, happened a few years ago, I was not involved, I did witness this all happen though.\n\nAs I said happened a few years ago, I seen something today that reminded me of it.\n\nSo a few years ago around holiday time, I was out at the local Dollar store doing some shopping for some items I needed. This particular store was severely understaffed for the evening shift. There were two cashiers, even though the store only had three registers total. There was also one manager on duty. That made up all the employees in the store. It is holiday season, after Thanksgiving, so I have no idea why the store had so few employees working at night, when they have several during the day. But any ways, the manager had been in the back of the store the whole time I was there cleaning, arranging items on the shelf, trying to put things back where they go. \n\nAs everyone knows who work retail, when a company does this, they expect the manager to have the store cleaned properly by the next day, and to be out of the store on time. And it seemed all of this was laying on this one manager to do while the other two employees ran register.\n\nSo any ways, there were two lines backed up with people wrapping around the isle behind the registers. In one line a lady had on barely any clothes. It was December, but we lived in a southern state so it wasn't like freezing cold, but in my opinion a little to cold to be wearing what I call booty shorts, and sports bra, but to each their own, not my place to tell her what to wear. As I was standing there minding my business and waiting my turn, I guess someone close to the lady had said something about her choice of clothes, and how they were inappropriate to wear out in public. Next thing I know the lady started going off on a tangent about how these fat bi\\*ches needed to mind their business, and they were just jealous they couldn't look as good as her after having six kids. She was cussing, and raising her voice and get more vulgar and louder as she went on. A few people asked her to please keep her voice down, and not to cuss, because there was children in the store. Which only made her get louder. She got so loud that it drew the attention of the manager on duty.\n\nAt first the manager didn't know what was going on, she just assumed that the lady was aggravated because she had to wait in the long line. So she asked one of the cashiers why they didn't call her up for help. She opened her register, and started taking whoever came into her line. Well the lady doing all the yelling came into her line, and had two people in front of her. The whole time ranting and raving. So while the manager was ringing up the first person, she calmly asked the lady what the problem was, and asked if she could help in any way. The lady still cussing up a storm and still talking at the top of her lungs started telling her. \n\nSo the manager was like ma'am please I am trying to listen to what you have to say, but I would really appreciate it if you would stop with the cussing and lower your voice so I can understand you better. There are children here, and I do not wish for them to listen to this language. Well that set that lady off, and she started cussing out the manager. So the manager while still ringing up customers, and doing her job, simply stated if you can not lower your voice and stop cussing, I am going to refuse you service. Well as you can imagine that didn't go over well. So the manager stated calmly once again, that she refuses the woman service, and asked her to leave. The lady said f\\*ck off I am not leaving until I purchase my items, and if you don't sell them to me I will just take them. By this point the manager just picked up the phone, and dialed a number. \n\nAll the store is standing around watching this unfold, quietly. Even the ones who already paid for their items stuck in the store to watch it. The manger could be heard asking to have a police officer to show up, explained the problem, and said she would like to have a customer trespassed. Once through with the phone call, she went back to ringing up customers. Well the lady refused to leave. Stood in line with her items, and when she got to the front of the line, the manager simply picked up her items, grabbed a basket, placed them all in it, and stuck it under the counter, then started ringing up the next person. \n\nThat really set the lady off, and she stood in the way of the card reader, thinking if she blocked it, no one could swipe their card. The manger kept asking her to leave, over and over. But when it came time for the other customer to pay, she simply asked the customer for their card, and cashed them out from her side of the register. Bypassing the card reader on the counter. That really pissed the lady off, and she tried to come over the counter after the manager. \n\nIt was at the moment the cops came in and caught her trying to attack the manager, they handcuffed her and took her outside, and then one came in to ask what was going on. The manager explained, as well as a few witnesses and the lady had been arrested.\n\nSeveral of the customers, told the manager what a wonderful job she did keeping her cool, and how she handled it. \n\nI don't know what came of the lady, but the manager only stayed on at the store a couple months more. I had gone back in a few times after the incident, and talked to her. She was moving out of state. Hopefully she is doing well.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675535878.0},{"title":"What is Butane?","author":"_yakunitatanai","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/10tq5q8\/what_is_butane\/","text":"This was about three years ago - I (then 23F) and my fianc\u00e9 (then 26M) took a trip up to a northern city in our state for a weekend getaway. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how true it is, but my parents told me that if I plan to travel by car to a place that\u2019s a higher altitude then you need to empty any torches\/refillable lighters you have to reduce combustion and\/or drainage of butane.

Yeah, I was gonna be that guy who holds a camera in the ocean in Hawaii.\n\nHowever, on 1\/27 I noticed that the delivery had been delayed and said that Saturday delivery had been requested, which of course wouldn't work for  me since I would be on a flight. So I called, got someone named Abby.  She assured that the camera would be delivered on time and asked for  proof that the delivery had been delayed. So I grabbed a screenshot of  their own website to send back to her, gave her my honeymoon address in Hawaii to reroute the shipment. She promised that she would get back to  me by the end of day with what was happening. When I asked to clarify  when the end of day would be, she dodged the questions and just repeated  end of day. I was just curious what time zone they were in, but I  shrugged my shoulders and moved on. Guess what happened by the end of  day? Nothing, no response.\n\nSo, on 1\/28, during a layover I called again. This time I got a man named Jade.  I asked him to get the package rerouted or to talk to a supervisor. I gave him the address again because what he had on file was wrong. I told  him I'd be on a flight for the next 6 hours, but they could call me back anytime after that, which was still 2-3 hours of business time  left. Guess what happened by the end of the day? Nothing, no response.\n\nSo, on 1\/29, I called again. This time I got quickly rerouted to a  supervisor, Fred. He seemed understanding. He promised to look into  possible solutions and to get back to me within 24 hours. He read me the  Hawaii address they had on file and it was wrong again, so I corrected  it again. Guess what happened by the end of the day? Nothing, no response. And what happened by the end of the next day? Nothing, no response.\n\nSo on 2\/1, I called again, got someone named Arnold. I tried to get him to link me up with  Fred again, but Fred wasn't in office so they put me in the queue for  another supervisor. Thirty minutes later, David called me back.

Surprise surprise, no refund ever came and the manager never called me.\n\nIt wasn't worth pursuing so I dropped it, but the whole situation still makes me really upset.\n\nEdit: for clarification, the cashier touched her own face near the upper corner of her eye.

The store runs a promotional sale for meat products (buy 5 items for $20). For as long as I've gone to this store (and the chain itself), it's always let you do this sale twice a day using their membership card. So I went to the self-checkout and rang up my items, and it wouldn't take the money off for the second order (someone in the meat dept. had stickered a couple of packages of meat wrong). I called for the cashier watching the self-checkout over to help me. She said \"oh, it only lets you get that sale once a day\". I asked her when they had changed that (keep in mind the sales paper and all of the signs in the meat dept say \"limit 2 transactions per day\"). She said \"it's been that way since I started working here in 2017\". I told her calmly that I've been coming to this store for years and 2 a day has always been the policy, and that it says it on the advertisements. Her response? \"Are you ret**ded or just stupid? I know my job! Do I come to your work and tell you how to do your job?!\". Then she walked away, leaving the self-checkout on an employee service page...so I couldn't even check out. \n\nAfter that, I left my stuff and walked over to the CS desk. I told them what happened, along with this nice old lady who was checking out at the self-checkout next to mine who confirmed what the cashier had said. The manager on duty fixed my purchase (it took them a second to figure out that something had been mislabeled), and they called the cashier over and asked if what I said was true. She tried to say that I screamed at her and demanded free stuff, which was swiftly debunked by the nice older lady and several other people who were nearby. They fired her on the spot, and she's walked away in a huff.\n\nI wasn't happy she was fired, even if she deserved it. I was sad more than anything. If she had so openly said something like that to me, a person who isn't mentally handicapped, you can imagine that there's a good chance she's said it to someone who was. I can't begin to think how that would feel. And if she had just taken the time to look over my order in the first place and find that one item (that the manager found in like a second), all of this could've been avoided. \n\nPeople, please don't use the word \"ret**ded\". While it was at one time a common word to display disgust with someones stupidity or the stupidity of a situation, we know now that it is really hurtful.\n\nTL; DR: cashier used a mentally challenged slur at me and didn't do her job, and the result was that she was fired on the spot.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1674924990.0},{"title":"I can buy whatever I want for whoever I want","author":"Whiskeygirl81","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/10p87ca\/i_can_buy_whatever_i_want_for_whoever_i_want\/","text":"My husband and I were sitting in a diner eating lunch one day. At first we thought we had a great server. Friendly, attentive etc.\n\nWhile sitting there enjoying our meal, a guy I knew my whole life came in. Now mind you he is older than I am, was friends with my mom. And lived in a care facility, because mentally he was not all there. During the day he rides his bike all over town, it gives him something to do, and he enjoys it. At night he goes back to the care facility. He gets disability, but most of his money goes to paying the care facility to live there.\n\nWell on this day he came in, asked a waitress for a cup of water in a to go cup. My waitress decides to chime in and says, you know we can't just give you the water, you have to pay for it. Robert was already pulling out change and counting it out at this point, and he said yes I know and held up the change. My waitress kept after him, saying I don't think you have enough change, you can't get a water, and just berating him.\n\nI told my husband that I was going to buy Robert a drink, and he was ok with it. So I called my waitress over, ( at this point I am upset at the way she treated Robert , but don't show it) and I said add his drink to my bill. She said you don't need to do that, he comes in every other day and expects us to give him water for free. I am not allowing you to pay for him. That statement right there set me off. So loud enough for the whole place to hear, I said for starters it is none of your damn business to tell me what I can and can not do with my damn money if I want to buy someone something I damn well can, and your job is to do what the f\\*ck I want. Secondly your behavior towards that man was nasty and out of line. Sitting here loudly berating him because he looks as if he don't have enough money for something. You don't know Robert or his situation. I do , I have known that man my whole damn life. Thirdly water is f\\*cking free on your menu, but you want to be a b\\*tch and charge him for it, because you think he is homeless and beneath you. Well news flash b\\*tch that man is not homeless. Stop passing judgement on people because of the way they look. Now give him his damn water, and it better be a f\\*cking large one, put it on my f\\*cking bill, and bring me my damn bill. I will not be leaving you a tip, and I want to talk to your manager right now,\n\nShe ran off to get manager , while the whole diner applauded me. Robert thanked me, and the manager came out to talk to me. I told him, that I did not appreciate her attitude, that if she wasn't reprimanded I would leave a review online, as well as call corporate. And that from now on if I ever heard of Robert being treated that way again, I would make sure everyone knew how they treated customers in their establishment. He assured me he would rectify the situation, and any time I saw Robert after that he said he has never been treated poorly again.\n\nETA: Thank you for the award","upvote_ratio":0.49,"created_utc":1675098981.0},{"title":"She wasn't having it","author":"Forsaken_Ad_1453","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/10luu68\/she_wasnt_having_it\/","text":"A while back I was at a nearby Asian market stocking up on boba , I don't know if you've ever bought it in bulk for personal use but you'll get it in like 5+ gallon buckets that can be hard to wrangle depending on how many you have.

Before getting started, we go to one of the restaurants for lunch.\n\nWe arrive a little after 11:00 and are seated right away. The restaurant had just opened so it\u2019s not busy at all.  The waitress brings our menus and takes our drink orders.

We say no and that we just want the check, and she leaves. Five minutes later:\n\nWaitress: \u201cHey, I just wanted to double-check.

Today it's about my experience at a known food chain this week. \nI'm sorry if I offend anyone or if I come off as whiney. \n\n'Midge of backstory; my days are not in routine, I struggle often, I have a clingy older infant, and living situation causes me stress. Work does too, am a retail worker and recently I have been struggling with my performance (which I am not proud of). The town I live in doesn't have many pleasant residents. I have more negative interactions than positive, neutral being the usual. \nMy child is hard to lay down to sleep so often I am tired and lack energy, I don't drink energy drinks (for multiple reasons).\nI'm fairly shy and get nervous when ordering food. I don't like to bother people and hope people wouldn't bother me BUT when I work, people have actively harassed me. I have grown to dislike people in the recent two years. I still try to maintain a level of professionalism even though my willpower to is draining.\n\nThe story: My day started with me opening the store. I am one of the key delegates for managing. It opens at 8 but we have to be there either at 6-7 am, and my child didn't sleep until 4. I was tired. It was a busy morning, I was by myself for 3 hours, had a deadline for a store task, a few customers threw their money (very rude by the way especially when your cashier has their hand out for the cash). Prices issues. Unhappy people here and there. Tiring day. I didn't get breakfast or lunch. I got off at 3 and my lover texted me about getting food from the mentioned food chain. I agreed and off I went.\n\nI wear glasses and completely forgot them (don't do this) as normally I don't wear them at home but I can't see far away as well, and I don't have a spare in the car (we all should ngl). But I generally remembered what my lover likes since they didn't specify what they wanted so the menu wasn't as much of an issue until I decided I wanted to get something but wasn't sure. I probably should have looked at the menu online. It didn't occur to me. I get into the building. \n\nI greet the ladies there, I slightly cut off the lady but I didn't mean to because we greeted at the same time but I apologized. Her face went from smiling to sort of a deadpan I guess. I really wasn't trying to cut her off. She asked what my order was but I forgot how many chicken fingers were in the item so I had to take a moment, I apologized and said I forgot my glasses. Everything is fussy up there.. okay? \n\nI ordered three items. A salad, the meal fingers, the chicken sandwich meal. She asked a name for the order and I gave my name. She asked for the spelling (no one has ever asked me for the spelling), I spelled it out, she said it back. With how my name is you could put idiot in there if you take off the a and add ot. I heard her lowly say it but I didn't think much of it. My receipt however had the spelling she gave me. I could tell she was irritated and pissed off about something from her demeanor. My order came quick. I was struggling with the ice drink machine as it wouldn't give me ice immediately when she yelled for me with a tone even though she saw me right there. I haven't a clue what I did. I apologized and thanked her. \n\nI am a bit goofy by nature and it gets more noticeable when I lack the requirements for surviving. However I really can't think of a reason as to why she blatantly insulted me. I did nothing to her. The order didn't take longer than 2 minutes if even a minute and they were dead at the time. I read the names out properly. I just took a few extra moments. I have gone there on other occasions and all were pleasant except for one other when this boy in the further back of the restaurant saw me, made eye contact, and said \"oh boy here we go\". I laughed at him and made my order quick with no issues and went about my business while staring at him. Because why not. Their job is on the same street as mine and it is possible some of them have gotten pissed off with my store. It's whatever. It's just.. I don't try to cause issues for workers.

My wife and I were going to an early show at the theater during the week, and we went to a nearby restaurant for lunch. It was a nice little place that I'm sure gets busy at night, but was basically empty for lunch, there was only 1 waitress and no one else eating besides us and a small group of young Asian guys a few tables down.\n\nWell as soon as the waitress walks up, she immediately gives off just an aura of hostility. She was not friendly at all, very short and seemingly annoyed with any questions we had. She'd disappear for long stretches and eventually she gives the other group their bill. Now the guys seemed quiet and friendly and didn't do anything weird or inappropriate while we were there, so idk if they were the cause of her anger but however she spoke to us, she was worse to them, and it was clear they didn't appreciate it either. Well they pay their bill and leave while she's away. She walks up to grab their check, and literally yells \"what the F\" sprints to the exit after them and starts yelling at them down the street \"SO YOUR JUST NOT GONNA EFFING TIP ME HUH??\n\nNow I used to manage a restaurant, no matter how bad the service is, I always tip. It's just usually like 30% for good service and less for bad service.

I worked food service when I was young, then moved to retail and then owned my own retail store for many years. I know shit happens, that it all works out in the end, and not getting stressed about stuff is the key to happiness. I don't like drama. Some people just can't work with that, probably because there's no suffering in it.\n\nThere was a restaurant that I used to eat at two or three Friday nights a month. It was high end casual. White table cloths, they changed the cutlery between courses, just under a hundred dollars per person without alcohol. We don't drink.\n\nOne server who had been there forever took care of the back of the room by himself with a runner\/busser. Six deuces, three four tops a four person booth and a six person booth. We were always there about five. I had someplace to be at 7:30. The hostess would seat us and he would be right behind her with our drinks. We were fast. No alcohol, gone in an hour, good tippers. If it was busy, he could get another turn out of that table.\n\nOne night we walked in and he was working the front. When he saw us, he mouthed 'sorry.' The manager had decided to put him in the front and two servers in the back section. His section was full. Right away things went off the rails. I wanted a tonic water with a lime, in a pint glass. Huh? Tonic water. Out of the gun. With a lime. Just tell the bartender; she knows. I got soda water with a lemon in a ten ounce glass. Whatever, that'll work.\n\nIn this place, all the entrees changed throughout the week. On Fridays there was usually a bunch of stuff I don't eat. Coho Salmon, fresh water fish, mollusks, lamb. I ordered filet au poivre. Medium well. (You can keep your opinions about that to yourself.) Soup, salad, entree. Did I want my soup and salad with my entree? Ahhh...no. Soup, then salad then entree. Just like it says in the bible.\n\nI like to sit opposite the pass so that I can watch the show. I knew the Chef in this restaurant. He had been a customer of mine in the previous place he worked. He was out tonight. He had told me earlier in the day that he was going to his sister's wedding that weekend.\n\nMy filet comes out. It was a little charred. Not unusual with medium well. But at one point the grill had flared and it taken them a minute to get it under control. The filet was well\/medium well about an inch or so around the edge, and then a bloody center. So I ate what I liked, plus everything else on the plate, and pushed it a way. The busser came to clear my plate. I knew him well, because he was the other half of the team that could manage the back half of the restaurant on their own. He looked at the plate, he looked at me, then he took the plate by itself up to the pass. The manager saw that and ran over. My server was there already. An animated discussion ensued. They pulled and inspected the ticket. I could see by the hand gestures the conversation was something along the lines of, it says medium well, it isn't medium well, why didn't you make it medium well. The chef threw up his hands and walked away.\n\nThe manager comes up to the table. Was there a problem with your meal? Now, the one thing I hate more than drama is bull shit, because bullshit causes me to want to make drama. I wanted to say, you knew what the issue was over there. Was you memory wiped while you walked the ten feet over here? But I didn't. No, I said, everything is fine. Is there anything I can do....she starts to ask. I hold up my hand and say yes, you can not do this. It takes her a second to get that. Then she starts to say, okay, well I'll just take the filet off... No, I say, just leave the check alone. Now I'm annoyed. She turns and goes to the POS and probably starts to take the filet off, but at this point my regular server sees whats going on, he sees that I am becoming angry, walks up to the manager, takes the ticket, pushes her out of the way and enters it under his number as it originally was. When he gets to the table, I am already holding out my card. He runs it, I add 20% and sign and we are on our way. I smile and say good evening to everyone on my way out.\n\nAs we were walking down the street, my friend says, why do I feel like you were a raging asshole in there? But you were never rude and you never raised your voice. Because I was a raging asshole. I made it quite clear that we all had a role to play in there, and I did everything I was supposed to do. I ordered my food, I ate what I wanted and I paid my tab. I was polite, I smiled, I looked everyone in the eye, I didn't complain, I didn't point any fingers, I didn't shame anyone. Any mistakes were made by not me. And everybody got paid.

They will definitely ask if you want your soda refilled or your alcoholic beverage.

First, let me assure you that we can work this out.\n\nWe appreciate your business, and want you to understand our methods, and why the invoice was sent. I will quote some of our policies that some folks just don\u2019t read in advance\n\nI\u2019ve also attached screenshots of your order with costs, etc\n\nWe ask that you read our \"info and policies\" section of our website for a better understanding of the process.\n\n\\[LINK\\]\n\nThis describes exactly what you were questioning about additional charges and\/or hidden charges.\n\n\\[*Here\u2019s the relevant part from that page \u2026*\n\nWhenever possible, we try to combine multiple items together to save you shipping costs. Since preorder item arrival times are only estimates, we strongly suggest keeping any preorder item in separate orders from in-stock or other preorder or special order items. We will ship ahead any in-stock items in orders that contain preorder items yet to arrive. This will result in extra shipping costs to you. Please be mindful of this when combining preorder or special items in a single order. Also, some items, such as posters requiring a separate mailing package (tube), or very fragile items, may need to be shipped apart from others.\n\nShipping charges are estimated only. Final adjusted shipping charges will be calculated at the time of actual shipping based upon both the \"raw weight\" and \"dimensional weight\" (Length x Height x Width). At times shipping charge adjustments occur due to unexpected special handling or packaging, or size and weights as many items are newly released, so we may attempt to contact you for additional shipping charges prior to shipping the products, or we may charge you or change the method of shipping to accommodate funds provided or for time constraints. The customer accepts that all direct, out of pocket shipping charges to \\_\\_\\_ are to be paid for by the customer. \\_\\_\\_ does not absorb shipping charges for any reason.\n\n\u2026 *END of relevant part*\\]\n\nYour order contained multiple items with different arrival times, and since we ship together, we usually wait for all items to arrive.\n\n\u201cWhenever possible, we combine multiple items together to save you shipping costs. Since preorder or special item arrival times are only estimates, we strongly suggest keeping any item that may have different arrival times in separate orders from in-stock or other preorder\/special item orders to avoid more shipping costs and delays of your in-stock items.We also, though, reserve the right to ship ahead any in-stock items in orders that contain delayed items yet to arrive. This will result in extra shipping costs to you. Please be mindful of this when combining items in a single order.\"\n\nThe Witch Aurora Tribute kit was drop shipped directly from the caster (we pay $35 to him to ship).\n\nThe second shipment for the 4 mini busts we charged you $15 and it cost us $14.62. (Please see attached screenshot that supports this.)\n\nThe third shipment upcoming for the Hunchback is estimated to be around $20, and we have only a $17.40 credit for this order which is for the item and shipping, hence the paypal invoice to cover the 3rd shipment and item costs\n\nAlso, you saved $37 on the order with your coupon redemption.\n\nSo, bottom line is that if we ship this $36 item that\u2019ll cost us $20 to ship, we will then be losing $38-39 without any additional funds, hence the invoice. It is not a hidden fee, we do explain in our policies.\n\nWe understand that people bundle items to save on shipping, but often aren\u2019t aware that one item may ship in Feb and the other in Dec, and often don\u2019t read our policies concerning bundling shipments.\n\nWe appreciate your business and recognize your support, and look forward to your reply\n\nThank you for your patronage and patience, and Happy Holidays!\n\n**GUY-A**\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REPLY EMAIL END \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHe then attached a bunch of screen shots showing that the shipping fees charged by \\[SHIPPING COMPANY\\] are indeed very close to what they charged me for shipping. But I didn\u2019t accuse them of inflating prices, just of splitting things without permission and hiding this info on a back page, and not mentioning this on any of their website pages. (In fact, it's in small print on their \"Returns and Refunds\" page.)\n\nMeanwhile, I have three other pre-order items\u2014$1400 worth\u2014on standby that the manufacturers haven\u2019t shipped out to the stores yet. I will cancel these after I resolve this since I discovered that I can get them for over $150 less at \\[OTHER ONLINE STORE\\] that charges a flat $4.00 shipping fee. And I won\u2019t do business with **MM** anymore.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to get this finally resolved before I pull out. I\u2019d like to either (a) receive my item, or (b) get a full refund ($52, not the $17 they think is proper), before I cancel my three huge orders. But it seems that, with this small print that states they can ship items as separately as they see fit, and change prices, I have no text-based grounds.\n\nThe fact that he acted so unethically a year ago (see timeline above) makes my writing something cool and polite hard. As you all know, my heartfelt emails sound infantile and are unhelpful.\n\nThanks in advance for taking time to look at this long post.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1672723841.0},{"title":"I was mocked by a big chain fast food associate.

We arrived a little early so we we\u2019re waiting on the bar and we we\u2019re happy about it but they didn\u2019t actually sit us until way longer than our reservation had actually started and there were visible empty tables. \n2.

The entrees took a very long time to arrive for us and  everyone around us, the kitchen was open so we could see they were playing a game.\n5. They started to get pushy to getting us to order more drinks when we were on our 4th and 3rd cocktail respectively and they weren\u2019t empty yet.\n6.

It was a good offer but still a pretty hefty sum (1.6k\u20ac) so I expected quite some quality. \n\nWhen it arrived I noticed some things that weren't right, e.g. The TV being tilted a bit more to one side (even used a level to be sure it wasn't the wall unit it was placed on), the frame not fully covering the screen, unstable rear wall. I talked to customer support about it and they said pretty much the only thing I could do is to send it in and replace it. \n\nSince I paid so much money for the TV I expected a bit more here and initiated an RMA to hopefully get a better unit. The RMA process was started and I got an email saying they will let me know when the old TV is picked up so that I'll get a new one. This was end of May '22.\n\n\nAfter 6 more months of waiting, chatting with customer support, calling the support Hotline and always getting a \"we are working on it\", I finally got a call in November. They told me something must have went wrong and asked whether I still want to return the TV and get a replacement. They checked that there was another unit in store to be sent out immediately after my TV was returned (another really stupid way to handle it, instead of just switching it right away). The lady on the phone said it will not take longer than a week, max 2.\n\nSo the process was initiated again, again I got an email saying they will notify me for the pick up date and this time the old TV eventually got picked up by the end of November.\n\n\nNow it's 29th of December and I still don't have a new TV :). Chats\/talks with customer support end in \"yeah, status is still processing. Old TV is not marked as arrived, yet\".

It was an east coast chain with lots of things on a flat top and lots of ice cream. At the end, the bill was about $25. I\u2019d never touched the check, which means I\u2019d seen those extra couple bucks get thrown in, and understood the concept of a tip, but had no idea how to calculate it. Nobody else had any clue either so I added an extra $3. \n\nNext time I was in the car with my dad, I told him what happened and asked how to tip. From then on, every time the check was dropped, I got to grab it and estimate the tip (much to my brothers\u2019 annoyance). And from then on, I figured out how to tip properly. \n\nMy dad and I still talk about and consult on tips (especially recently when he started getting delivery or using ride shares and I got to teach him). We were talking about it recently and I just learned that after that first snafu he actually went back to the restaurant to give the waitress the rest of her tip and a bit extra cause it was a place we went often enough, and he knew the waitress. He said, \u201cit was my fault you didn\u2019t know how to tip.

I have sometimes found a hair in my food, and just took it out and carried on eating. Having worked in the food industry a few years back, I know it's a very demanding job, and sometimes people make mistakes, and that's perfectly fine. But that one restaurant meal, a few years back, was the most baffling experience of my life, and as I recently got reminded of it, I thought I would share it here!\n\nAs I mentioned, it was a valentine's meal, but we had decided not to celebrate it on the day, but rather the day before or after (I can't quite remember), just to avoid the crowds of people and have a quiet evening.\n\nMy then-boyfriend \/ now husband had booked a table for 7pm at this Italian restaurant. We arrived maybe 5 minutes earlier, and as planned, the restaurant was basically empty, there was maybe one or two other couples in a room of about 30 tables. The waiter who welcomed us confirmed our reservation, but then proceeded to say that we needed to sit down in a waiting area while they got our table ready. We then had to wait for about 25 mins there, even though every single table in the restaurant was already clean and dressed. The waiter kept going in and out of the kitchen, always empty handed, but never prepared a table for us. He eventually just came back for us and took us to a random table that had been ready since we arrived..\n\nHe then came back about 15 minutes later to see if we wanted any drinks, and we asked for two small glasses of red wine.\n\nA few minutes later, he comes back to take our food order, and about 15 minutes later, the food turns up, but we still don't have any drinks, so my boyfriend politely enquires about them, to which the waiter replies \"mmh yeah... I'll see how the wines are getting on...\", as if it needed to be cooked or something \ud83d\ude05 \n\nFrom where we were sitting, we could clearly see the bar area, empty, and the bartender, just casually leaning on the counter and chilling. We see them talk for a few minutes, before they actually bring us... two very large glasses of red wine. My boyfriend then tells the waiter that he can either give us the drinks but make us pay for the price of the small glasses, which is what we ordered, or take these back and give us two small glasses instead, whatever is easier for them. The waiter just had this very confused look on his face, and just said yes, while very obviously pretending to write something down on his notebook. Weird, but OK \ud83e\udd2a\n\nSeveral minutes later, the manager then comes to see us, and brings us another two large glasses of red wine. At this point, no one had taken away our first drinks, so we now had 4 untouched very large glasses of red wine. So we explain once again, that we only wanted two small glasses, not 4 large glasses. In the end, they take away two of the glasses and leave the other two for us to drink.\n\nAt this point, we are already half way into our meals, and we just finish eating and decide to not have desserts. We then ask for the bill, which again takes about 10 minutes, even though the restaurant is still completely dead, and lo and behold, we have 2 larges glasses of wine on the bill. So we ask the waiter to change the price for two small glasses, since that was our agreement. \n\nThe manager comes back with the amended bill, and we ask to split the bill in half, to which he replies \"romance is dead!\" We try and laugh it off, and my boyfriend is about to pay, when he realises that the manager put the full amount on the card and tried to trick him into paying the bill for me too.. He politely asks again to split the bill, and the manager reluctantly obeys, while adding comments saying that men should pay for women, and that his own wife, I quote, \"rapes his credit card, left, right and centre\".. He then proceeds to ask how long we've been together, to which we reply \"6 months\", and he just says \"I give your relationship 3 months\".\n\nSuffice to say we left and never came back! \ud83d\ude05\nAnd now that we have been together for 7 years, and married for one, it remains a fun weird restaurant story to tell people..!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671746916.0},{"title":"A tale of two autocentres","author":"BaffledAndBemused","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/zrff3i\/a_tale_of_two_autocentres\/","text":"For simplicity and anonymity purposes, let's call this big UK autocentre corporation Happy's autocentre.\n\nSo I live in the West of England and have for the past 3 years almost for university, but this is the first year I've lived somewhere with free on-street parking so I decided to bring my car with me. However, I'd never gotten any repairs or my MOT done in the area, so I decided to go with Happy's, since they have a branch where my parents live as well and they've always been really helpful and affordable.\n\nSo I happily book myself an MOT for early December (the only available day where it didn't clash with lectures was the day it ran out or a month before so I chose same day as it had had a service fairly recently) and go about my life. December rolls around, I take it in all happy, go to work by bus...and get a voicemail after work saying that the parking break needs repairing but they themselves don't have time to do it until January. Crap. \n\nNo biggie i think to myself, so I call my next closest Happy's as again, I'd rather trust in this branch than some random garage, take it in the following week and leave it with them Friday-Tuesday. They tell me it's all dandy, charge me \u00a3149.69 for their troubles, and I happily trot back over to the first Happy's to get my retest done, and once again go to work.\n\nToday (which is also my 23rd birthday) I call the Happy's branch all happy to ask when I can pick up my car, just to be told...they haven't done anything. The brake still isn't working, in fact it's worse than before, they can't even get it to stay still on the rollers they test the brakes on without even turning them on. Our friendly customer desk person, T, asks me where I got it done because this is still going to fail, to which I say \"well, your colleagues at XYZ location, I have the invoice and everything, they charged me like \u00a3150 for it\". Our friendly customer desk person seems very displeased by this, asks me to give him an hour to sort it out and he will call me back.\n\n10 minutes ago, T calls me, tells me not to worry, they're taking it apart NOW and it will be done today. I ask if I need to take it anywhere else or anything like that, and am informed no, he is dealing with it and I don't need to worry about a thing.\n\n\nInteresting concept...if I hadn't had to get an MOT retest, I wouldn't have felt the need to check my brakes or handbreak were working. I wouldn't have thought twice about parking on a hill or doing a hill start, because the garage told me it's fine, they charged me, they told me they checked it. My car could have been damaged, I could have gotten into an accident, I could have hit someone running into the road because my breaks weren't working well enough. I am fuming.\n\nI will update with the outcome after work...\n\n\nUpdate:\nSo, trusty T from my local Happy's called me as I was on my way to work to let me know that one one of the two parts he needed actually arrived today and the other one will be arriving tomorrow. Bless this man he sounded so done with the company! But my main concern was that today was my last day where I could have an MOT retest rather than a whole new test. Luckily, T was a step ahead of me there and told me not to worry, he will do a full MOT on it tomorrow after the work is done, also because he's concerned about other issues that may have arisen from the botched repair, and most importantly...I'm not paying a thing for it, it's all entirely being done for free (as it should be but it was nice to have confirmation of that) and I will be able to get myself home for Christmas!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671614394.0},{"title":"Maddening customer service experience from a billion-dollar tech company","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/zqrd0z\/maddening_customer_service_experience_from_a\/","text":"So I want to develop a chatbot project, and I wanted to test this hundred-year-old tech company's products, which has this neat AI Engine named after Sherlock Holmes's best friend.

And a lot of people have had horrible experiences at this store (myself included in a few cases), but I wanted to share the story of how an employee at this one particular store helped save the life of a lovebird.\n\nTo explain; this lovebird was one of two (no, they were not a mated pair; I strongly suspect that they were siblings) that belonged to one of the fellow members of my grandmother's church. Well, that member passed away and their family didn't want the birds, so they ended up getting passed from church member to church member as they tried to find someone who would take care of them. Grandma remembered that I used to have birds (two parakeets), and figured I'd be the best to take care of them.\n\nI was *woefully* unprepared for lovebirds. They are not like parakeets *at all*, but I did everything I could to try and be their forever home. A few months after they came into my care, one of the birds began obsessively plucking. The bird was clearly uncomfortable, constantly moving, feathers never fluffing, eyes pinning, and I had no idea what was wrong. Everything I could find online said *go to vet*. Only problem is that the majority of vets in my area cater to dogs, cats, horses, pigs, sheep, and cows. Birds aren't really on that list. I was driving past the animal shelter when I remembered that they sometimes get chickens turned over, so I went in and asked for what vet they take animals to. They sent me to their vet of choice.\n\nI went in, explained my situation to the young woman behind the counter, who nodded and began talking about the cremation fees and that I'd have to find my own \"cremation containment unit\" for my pet's ashes, because they didn't sell those. Bear in mind, they hadn't even *seen* the bird yet. Just a rough description of what was wrong with him. I was devastated. I was in shock.\n\nI made my way to the pet store (which happened to be near the vet) and was in bird supplies when I was hit with the overwhelming realization that *my bird was probably going to die*, which would lead to the other one dying, because birds need flocks and I had no access (or funds) to buy another lovebird. I'm standing there, quietly losing my mind, when an employee asks me what was wrong. The whole story spills out and the young man nods and says \"Sounds like your bird developed an allergy.\"\n\nRecord scratch. What? That's a *thing*? Birds can get allergies?\n\nYes, dear reader. Yes, they can. The employee recommended a specific, allergy free bird food (which, bonus, had less waste than the food they *had* been eating up to that point), so I bought it and took it home and switched their food (making sure to thoroughly dump, wash, and dry *everything* to avoid cross contamination in case that was the issue)--and the problems cleared up. My bird started relaxing, stopped picking at the skin (which was what happened next after the feathers on the chest were all plucked out) and calmed down. I had to be extra careful to make sure the bird didn't catch a chill (no feathers to insulate the chest), but it survived several more years.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671360324.0},{"title":"How am I feeling bad after overtipping?","author":"Rakne97","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/zov821\/how_am_i_feeling_bad_after_overtipping\/","text":"TLDR: because of sudden circumstance, I overtip someone who was less deserving and get guilt tripped over it.\n\nContext: So my family and I just left the homestay we booked at, which currently was undergoing renovation and failed to inform us about it.\n\nWe were in a mad panic as it was the weekend and tourist season so there was difficulty in finding a place to stay.

My friend gave me the umbrella, which I put in my iced coffee.\n\nMy friend basically slammed it since it was summer and it was hot outside, and asked for a refill which the waitress got for her. About 25% of the way into the next iced tea she realized she was getting inebriated and asked if the iced tea had alcohol, to which the waitress became defensive and said \"it's a long island iced tea, which is what you asked for\". We told her that she just wanted a regular iced tea and that we were minors, so she just took the long island iced tea away and brought out a plain iced tea in a plain glass. When she returned with the iced tea, she said I had to take the umbrella out of my iced coffee because it was an alcohol marker and made me give it to her, which I felt was way overkill and also just not true in most restaurants.\n\nAt this point, my friend, who had no real previous experience with alcohol, was already kind of fucked up from the 1.25 long island iced teas and couldn't drive, basically trapping us at the restaurant as I did not even have my permit yet at the time. After this the waitress became pretty rude with us, not only taking away my drink umbrella but dropping off the food without saying anything and rushed away (she actually gave us opposite dishes and we had to swap) and refusing to come by again to bring napkins or refill water, which my friend needed to help sober up.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, now around 12:15 pm, the waitress brought the bill unprompted and told us that the restaurant was closing in 15 minutes. The bill charged us like 24 dollars for 2 long island iced teas, which she refused to strike from the bill even when we said she only drank about a fourth of the refill and didn't ask for\/want either drink. We called her dad and he said it wasn't worth it to fight her, so we just paid and tipped a very small amount, and the waitress basically immediately boxed up our food and kicked us out as soon as she returned, despite other people still sitting and eating unrushed.\n\nThe restaurant was off the highway and literally could not be exited or even crossed on foot without driving to exit. We had to go out to the car my friend still couldn't drive. Looking back I think the waitress realized she could get jail time\/fired for serving minor alcohol and wanted us out of there asap and that's why she was rude and pushy with us, which she didn't even apologize once for.\n\nWe turned on the AC since we were now trapped in the car. Of course, we did not realize it because we were dumb kids, but by spending another hour waiting for my friend to sober up in the ac without turning the engine on we basically killed her battery, and the car wouldn't start when we tried to turn it on, fully trapping us in the parking lot. \n\nHer whole family was at the destination by this point, including her brother and his friends in their car, so I had to call MY dad who was at work at the time to come and jumpstart her car, which again was like a 45 minute drive out of town. We had to wait for him which took another hour and half since he didn't leave right away and were very late and in bad moods when we finally got to the destination after another 3 hour drive, and we probably shouldn't have driven there the whole way after just jumpstarting the battery but there were no further issues. \n\nIt's kind of just become one of those stories her family tells, but looking back I kind of think we should have tried to sue. This happened about 6 years ago so it's too late now, but in my opinion the waitress really should've been held accountable for basically spiking a minor's drink and stranding us, kicking us out early to seemingly cover her own ass. The whole experience made me scared of driving when I started driving and scared of alcohol for a time, and soured our vacation since she kind of failed the rite of passage driving trip through no fault of her own. \n\nI know there was that one case with a 5 year old who was served a long island iced tea and the mother got like 75,000 dollars, but what would've been the likely actual consequences if we had tried to take legal action as 16\/15 year old's and not young children? Should the waitress have been fired or the restaurant fined\/liquor license revoked? Is this one of those things that just kind of sucks for everyone and we were better off not trying to sue? Overall it was one of the worst dining experiences I\u2019ve had, the food wasn\u2019t even good.

I think she created it to order a single promotional item many months ago. Fast forward to yesterday. All of the sudden her inbox (email) is unexpectedly flooded with over 60 random \"thank you for subscribing\" to various spam mail services. Because she misses zero details, she sees (buried inside all these mails) a \"thank you for you order\" mail from Bloomingfail's, followed by another email shortly after notifying her that her email \/ account credentials had been updated in the Bloomingfail's system....\n\nShe opens the mail, and  sure enough, someone had just placed an $800 order, shipping to her name, at an unknown address, in another state. Obviously she tries to log into her account, but she is locked out as the perpetrator has migrated the account to themselves after order #1.\n\nFirst call she makes is to American Express who immediately jumps into action and closes her card to minimize any further exposure considering these asshats have all of of information including name, address, phone, email, credit card info etc.\n\nNext call is Bloomingfail's. Not kidding the automated phone system is garbage. She is disconnected 6-7 times while also being forwarded to phone lines for unrelated departments across the mix. Zero exaggeration here. It took her almost an hour to find someone willing to help. Once she got someone, his first comment was to make an excuse that during holiday season, this type of fraud is \"common\" and to be \"expected.\" After that he asks some real questions.\n\nQuestion #1 from him: \"Was this fraud committed with \\[her\\] Bloomingfail's credit card?\" She does not have one, so the answer is \"NO.\" She informs him that they had used her personal credit card information that was stored in Bloominfail's system \\[tied to her account\\]. The tone to a huge turn at this point... He basically said, she was on her own and suggested she call American Express. She let him know that was already taken care of. Clearly this customer service agent did not give a f\\*ck as this fraud didn't seem to effect Bloomingfail's in any negative way.\n\nQuestion #2 form him: \"Is there anything else we can help you with?\"  She told him yes, I do need your help...\n\nFirst, she asked him if he could please get \\[her\\] back into \\[her\\] account so she can delete all her information as the account it is clearly not secure. He asked for her account information... Then told her, he could not get her into the account, as her email and login credentials no longer matched the account.  She explained to this dipsh\\*t that the thieves just changed all this providing details from the recent Bloomingfail's mail and order reference \\[previous and past\\] as evidence that someone had hacked their system and her account. Silence. He basically said he could not grant her access to an account she did not have access credentials for. I'm not making this sh\\*t up.\n\nSecond, she asked him to cancel the pending  \\[fraudulent\\] order that was shipping to her name. with some random stranger's address in another state. She expressed (he\/they) \\[Bloomingfail's\\] have just been notified that the order in question was in FACT fraud. Silence. He would not cancel the order.\n\nWe hung up in disbelief. Clearly Bloomingfail's wanted to keep the order as they make the money here no mater what... Essentially partaking in a know fraudulent transaction with no reason to care otherwise.\n\nI mean, seriously we are not making any of this up.\n\nThe only upside is that Bloomingfail's did in fact ship the order today. Since the item was shipped in my partner's name \\[with appropriate billing information attached\\], she was able to log into UPS and redirect the package to a hold location \\[next to our house\\] that requires ID for retrieval... Plus we live about 3 states away. So these crooks can't get their hands on this order no matter what. Once we receive the order we will turn it over to the local police (or American Express) as stolen property.\n\nI'm also seriously contemplating shipping a box full of d\\*cks \/ dildos to the address with a big \"F\\*ck you!\" note inside. Just because. These thieves are lame.\n\nUpdate: As noted we redirected the package the day after the order was shipped.

She's been contemplating using the money on heating but has decided to continue to layer up & have somewhere  comfortable to sit. \n\nSo today we went to a retail park that had 6 different furniture stores. She just wanted to go to one of them & try out the 3 styles she'd seen online, that had the colours she wanted & thought it would be sorted. \n\nThe sales woman who 'helped' her was clearly constantly looking around for people who wanted a whole sofa set, so more commission. She made a bit of effort initially, but when my mum was disappointed about the colours not looking like they did on the website & the models (in her budget) she wanted to try not being in store, she knew it wasn't a guaranteed sale & stopped bothering. \nI told my mum that she should have a think & come back. Sales woman practically rolled her eyes. We walked out and my mum started telling me how guilty she felt, the woman is trying to make a living, times are tough for everyone, she should just get that one so the sales woman gets the commission.\nI told her she'd saved hard for her chair & she shouldn't have to compromise & let's have a look around the other shops to see if we can find the right one. \nWe go to 2 other shops, the sales people were all the same. As soon as they realised she wasn't 100%, they lost interest & she felt more guilty. \nShe started crying when we got out of the 3rd shop. She felt guilty spending money on a luxury item when everyone else is struggling. \nI was torn, there were still 3 more shops to try, I didn't want her getting more upset but really wanted her to find 'her chair' & have something to look forward to.\nSo i got her to agree to go to 1 more store. \nYou know those little moments in life, the ones you dont even realise at the time? The ones that end up making a big difference, this was one of those. \n\nThe next store not only had the chair she wanted, comfortable, in the right colour but the sales lady was wonderful.

I dropped off my prescription and went into the corner out of the way to wait. \n\n\nThere was a guy talking to the pharmacist and he had his service dog with him. The dog was wearing his vest with tags, and he had tucked himself under the counter facing outwards, keeping careful watch on everybody nearby. \n\n\nOlder entitled lady is next in line behind them, and she starts trying to coax the dog out so she can pet it. The dog is having none of this and actively moves away from her because he's well trained and focused on his task. \n\n\nThis isn't enough for her. She then crouches down and scoots closer to the dog, extending her arm and calling \"her\" out. The guy was ignoring her and just trying to finish his business to leave as fast as possible. \n\n\nOne of the pharmacy techs spoke up at the same time as myself and another person in line. The guy in line told her to stop, she ignored him. The pharmacy tech told her not to bother the dog and she replied she just wanted to pet it. Now I've had my share of ableism directed at me, and I was feeling spicy after all the pain I was in from the dentist. \n\n\nI also told her to stop, it's a service dog. She replied oh \"she\" wants it! I said no that doesn't matter. This dog is considered a medical device, and he's performing a life-saving task. You are harassing this man.. stop!\n\n\nThen she finally stepped back, and said oh I see now \"she's\" wearing a vest. We went back and forth a bit more, and I told her that because this was inside of a grocery store, they sell food, only legitimate service animals are allowed inside. She responded saying she sometimes brings her chihuahua in the store tucked in her jacket. I just said you can't do that!\u00a0\n\n\nBy that time my prescription was ready. The guy and his dog left, and he thanked me on the way out. I heard some of the pharmacy employees asking each other if the lady was standing in view of the camera. I left after that, so I don't know what else the pharmacist may have said to her. Hopefully she gets banned from the store for bringing her pet inside. They could get shut down for that! And they may be feeling spicy about somebody harassing a guy who may very well be one of their favorite customers.\n\n\nI worked in pharmacy for a number of years until recently, so I've been on both sides of an interaction like this. The dog was such a good boy, working hard and never losing focus on his job. And the guy just wanted to pick up his meds like anybody else can, he shouldn't have to defend his dog every second.

It\u2019s only two minutes away which is great for my dog who doesn\u2019t like car rides. Receptionist is always rude but the rest of the vet staff is usually nice. Plus I\u2019m laid back and I\u2019ve worked in customer service jobs before, so I know how much their jobs can suck. I\u2019m extra patient with the staff.\n\nMy dog had his annual exam there four months ago with no issues. All the tests  came back negative. As usual, the vet tech asked if he was on any medication, I told them he was on medication for flea and heart worm. Then when the vet came in, we had a whole discussion about it because I was considering switching him to a different brand.\n\nFast forward to now, the vet clinic didn\u2019t approve my Chewy.com order for his heart worm refill. I called and asked the receptionist why.\n\nAfter pulling up his file, she said he had to come in and get tested again in order for him to get the refill because he wasn\u2019t on meds at the time of the annual exam and they need to make sure he doesn\u2019t have parasites.\n\nI explained to her that he\u2019s always been on meds nonstop since I got him a few years ago. She counters that I didn\u2019t tell them. I explained further that I did. She wouldn\u2019t budge, which I understand, it\u2019s a liability if it\u2019s not on their records. I\u2019m just annoyed at the fact that I did inform them of his medication status and they failed to document it. I\u2019m also getting less patient with her attitude at this point.\n\nThat was the last straw. I took my dog there a few times before that. I wonder if the receptionist is racist based on how she always treats me compared to the other customers she treats in front of me. It\u2019s just suspicion and I don\u2019t always suspect someone is racist when they are being rude.\n\nSince they\u2019re requiring blood tests again, I\u2019m just going to switch to a different clinic that\u2019s nicer. They saw him recently because that clinic he usually goes to didn\u2019t have availability at the time.\n\nUPDATE: The new vet clinic actually says that my dog doesn\u2019t need to have blood work done again. They just need his records from his previous vet. That\u2019s nice, I assumed he needed to have blood work done again because of what the receptionist at the old vet told me. Not sure if it\u2019s good veterinary practice but they saved me money and I know he\u2019s never been off his heart worm and flea meds.\n\nEDIT: I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned my suspicion that the receptionist might be racist. There\u2019s some misunderstanding which is my fault because I didn\u2019t provide enough context. The suspicion is not because she wouldn\u2019t approve my dog\u2019s refill. The reason why is because I noticed she was consistently treating customers around me better. Maybe I\u2019ll provide specific examples in another post since it would be long.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t automatically think a rude person is racist. I have dealt with a handful of rude receptionists before, but she\u2019s the only one that I suspect might be a bigot. I do hope I\u2019m overreacting though.\n\nI definitely am not going to leave their clinic an online review accusing her of it.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1668532758.0},{"title":"Mistaken for 13","author":"RoseDragon529","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/yw5yfr\/mistaken_for_13\/","text":"I was at this \"nerd store\" in the local mall (had a bunch of stuff from different fandoms and stuff that wouldn't look out of place at a convention) and I got this little blind bag plushie.

But not telling disruptive people to control themselves or going as far as to kick out the really awful ones, hurts the business in the long term. Here's why:\n\nLast year my partner and I found a really cute little restaurant near where I live that we went to a few times over the course of a year. This was a pretty happening place that seemed to have folks in it all the time who were around our age (late 30's to early 40's). The first time we went we sat in the front of the restaurant near the bar and it was way too loud, so the other times after that we always sat in the back where it was much quieter (this was a seat yourself kind of a place).\n\nThe last time we went in there together, we sat in the back like usual. There were two other tables that were occupied, and that was it. The table in the far back corner was sat at by three people, who were very chatty but nothing outrageous. Yet.\n\nWe order our food, talk about this and that, then it comes and we start to eat. All is good. Then about a third of the way into our dinner that table I mentioned before starts to get loud. They aren't arguing but they are talking so loudly that their voices are booming across that whole area of the restaurant.\n\nOur server comes a few minutes later and checks in with us. Food is good, but the noise level is bugging me and I mention it. I was kind of lighthearted about it, just said humorously that I could do without the loud talking and nodded at the table. She said she understood and disappeared for a little while then reappeared several minutes later, this time checking in with that loud table.\n\nWell, the server joined in on the conversation and the volume went up considerably. It was already annoyingly loud enough, to the point where my partner and I couldn't talk to each other, but now it was just drunken boisterousness. It really bugged me that she encouraged it. It didn't help that the trio started hollering, not aggressively but just being way too loud. I spotted the other table near us turn and look at the group sharply when they started hollering, and I also overheard them complaining to the server when she checked up on them a little while later.\n\nMy partner was getting agitated and I told him I wanted to leave so we asked for to-go boxes, packed up, paid and left.\n\nI've never gone back there. Maybe I'm making a big deal of it but I don't eat out to hear three people hollering back and forth about how much they like peanut butter.

I noticed my 22 y\/o friend had a wristband and I was confused because I didn\u2019t get one, so I went back and I asked the bouncer why I didn\u2019t get a wristband when I am 21. He tells me it\u2019s because I have a fake ID.\n\nMy ID is 100% real; I turned 21 this July. I try to argue with him, and he says \u201cI teach classes on how to spot fake IDs, that there is a fake.\u201d I ask other bouncers to please look at it and FIVE other bouncers also said my ID was fake.

At this point I actually started crying because I have pretty bad social anxiety and this interaction was stressing me out a lot. I asked them if they would like me to call the police to confirm that my ID is real and they were not receptive at all to anything I was doing. I didn\u2019t call the police because they didn\u2019t actually confiscate my ID and so I wasn\u2019t sure if I really had any leverage over them. \n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if I hadn\u2019t bought tickets to this event and if it wasn\u2019t in the middle of nowhere. I couldn\u2019t have just taken my ID and went somewhere else because I had spent $30 on my tickets for this event and I was going there with friends. My friend ended up buying my drinks for me the whole night, but it was really annoying because I had to rub the Xs off my hand and hide the fact that I wasn\u2019t wearing a wristband with my jacket, and I was worried about getting kicked out the whole night. They wouldn\u2019t let me talk to a manager either. I talked to multiple other people in the club who were also 21+ and the same thing happened to them.\n\nI think they were very power-hungry bouncers and refused to admit that they might have made a mistake. My mother sent me pictures of my birth certificate and passport but I ended up just going in without a wristband. I don\u2019t understand why they think I would raise hell and argue with them about my ID being real if it was fake and risk them calling the police on me. I have had fake IDs before, and whenever I was caught I would just say \u201calright guys let\u2019s just go somewhere else.\u201d I\u2019ve made the decision to carry around my passport on me from here on out because I really don\u2019t feel like being in this situation again.

So when I finally asked why they kept adding meat, they told me that \"Oh, the receipt doesn't show the order requests\", but that is a lie (it shows the request right under what you ordered). So I sent a complaint to the manager that my meal keeps getting messed up, and they emailed me back asking what time I was getting the meals.

So we\u2019re not off to a great start. At least they get her a new drink and don\u2019t charge us for it. 2 of us get a starter Cesar salad and it tastes like tuna or salmon. I know that Cesar salad dressing has anchovies in it but those are two very different tastes. The real disaster starts when we get our meals.\n\nOne person in the group ordered a full Cesar salad and\u2026 she finds a live tick in it. Thankfully the rest us were done eating\u2026 but what does that mean about the state of the kitchen? I\u2019d rather get hot gravy spilled on me (that happened to my dad once, but that\u2019s a story for another day)!

I was looking for a pair of shooting gloves. I do target shooting and I like to wear gloves, especially with larger caliber guns. My old ones were falling apart. So I found a few online at a well known big box store that specializes in hunting\/fishing\/camping stuff. The one with taxidermy animals and a big fish tank. \n\nI went there after work. Inside the entrance is a young man in a wheelchair who asks me if he can help. I figure I got this, plus I wanted to look around, so I said No Thanks. Props to the store for hiring a disabled person though.\n\nSo I wander around the hunting\/shooting area for quite a while, can't find the gloves. I ended up in the shoe dept. Mistake #1. The woman there sees the logo on my sweater from a car dealership I work at and immediately launches into a diatribe about trying to buy a new Subaru (not our brand) and can't get one, blah blah blah and wouldn't shut up. I actually turned my back and walked away while she was still rambling about Subarus. Never once asked me if I needed anything, or even acknowledged that I was a customer.\n\nI decided to go up front and give the greeter guy a whirl. Mistake #2. Unfortunately now he was deep in a conversation with a Pest. A Pest is someone who hangs around retail stores and talks the ears off the captive audience there and never buys anything. The Pest says \"go ahead and help this guy (me), I'm just making conversation\". I explain what I'm looking for, the wheelchair guy looks at me like I just asked for dilithium crystals for my spaceship. But he's eager to help and we set off for the gun department. But with the Pest in tow, who states \"yeah, I'm looking for gloves too\". F\\*\\*\\* me. \n\nWe search all the places I already searched to no avail. I split off, and in a few minutes I actually stumble across their small display of shooting gloves. Success! I look around and there's the greeter and the Pest, aisles away and deep in the same conversation, completely forgetting me. So I found a pair that worked and brought them to the register. My two \"helpers\" never even glanced my way.\n\nI'm used to shopping for my shooting supplies at regular gun stores, which are legendary for their unhelpfulness and snarky attitude but I thought a national chain would have better customer service game than this.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1667010388.0},{"title":"\"a s**tshow of a day\" just got worse","author":"factualmistakes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/yg3hut\/a_stshow_of_a_day_just_got_worse\/","text":"This actually happened a few months ago but I just stumbled upon this subreddit. \n\nMy husband and I (as well as our young children) were at a generic grocery store and decided to go through self check out. Generally this company has stopped employing as many people on the front end so it's faster to go through self check out even with larger orders. I'd say we had 15-20 items, nothing crazy. We scan everything just fine, move it back into the cart and get ready to pay. My husband discovered a rewards check in his wallet so we decide to use that and as normal, press the \"other\" button that has a picture of a check on it to pay. \n\nThe attendant appeared to be a woman in her early twenties. She took some time coming over- which is fine, things get busy. Especially when you're running 6 kiosks by yourself. But when she comes over and my husband attempts to give her the check, she says \"we don't do that over here. You have to go through the normal registers.\" (Paraphrased)\n\nThe thing is, my husband works for this company. Not this store, but he's employed by them and knows everything there is to know about their stores - ESPECIALLY front end. We immediately just assume she's new and doesn't know, so we try to very politely explain that you can do it, you just have to transfer it to the front \"desk\" where there's a flip up till for whoever is working u-scan.\n\nShe gets annoyed and tells us that she knows but (and this is a quote, I sent it to my friend because I was so shocked) \"don't do that anymore. It's been a real sh*t show of a day and it's too much work.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say. She continued talking and littered her sentences with more cursing, right in front of my 1 and 2 year old children. I kind of gave my husband a WTF look, thinking maybe she worked with him at one point and it's supposed to be coworker banter and she just didn't think about the kids being there, but he's just as shocked as me. I keep the kids away from her while he finishes the transaction and we leave. \n\nSince my husband works for the company he doesn't get the \"leave a review\" code at the bottom of his receipt like most customers, so I called the front desk and asked if the front end manager was there. I relayed what happened and she was absolutely horrified. She was incredibly apologetic about both the employee lying about not being able to take a check (which she confirmed is possible and they're trained to take checks- not to refuse them as payment), and the amount of cursing she was doing in front of us and our toddlers. \n\nI don't know what happened to her. Generic store is union so it's very unlikely she was fired, but I never saw her again.\n\nEdit to add: This is the first and only time I've made a complaint about an employee. I met my husband working retail and he still works retail, so we try to be understanding towards others since we understand it's a high-stress low-reward environment. My kids are learning how to talk and repeat EVERYTHING. If they weren't there I'd still be shocked at a stranger talking to me like that but I probably wouldn't have complained.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1666998729.0},{"title":"Really strange restaurant experience","author":"FreakyPickles","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/yfur0x\/really_strange_restaurant_experience\/","text":"So, last week I went out for lunch with 2 old friends.

So, I have been living in my hometown for a few years and going to the gas station store there every now and then. It's right around the corner from my apartment, and it only takes a few minutes to walk there. So recently, I went there late at night, when I was feeling a bit under the weather, to see what I should buy to feel better.\n\nNow; to give some backstory, all the employees recognize me as a regular customer, except a late night worker who is an old man, that I will call \"Kevin\". I have been there a few times late at night, and Kevin has never been very friendly, and sometimes he acts like he's trying to catch people stealing, by watching people from a distance. I ignore it, because although it's a bit unsettling, he never did anything that I could actually report, until recently.\n\nSo I go into the gas station to look for something to buy. As soon as I enter, I can feel Kevin's eyes on me from the checkout counter. I ignore it and look for something to buy in the gas station aisles. As I am looking, at some point, suddenly, I see him slowly come around the corner of an aisle and walk towards me suspiciously. I try to ignore it at first because I know he just wanted attention, but he gets closer and closer, not taking his eyes off me, until I ask angrily, \"Can I help you?\" He then motions to check my pockets. I was confused at first, then it hit me, \"Black man in a store ate at night? Must be here to shoplift!\" Yes, I am a person of color, so it's possible that he could have been racist. Before I could respond, he gets mad and rudely tells me to leave the store, telling me that it's closed (it's open 24\/7, so that's a lie). I tried to argue back with him, but he would not listen. Also, before I left, he tried to gaslight me and tell me that maybe the situation should be forgotten about, because I am might be making too much of a big deal out of this. However, I wasn't going to let his actions slide.\n\nWith that said, fortunately, this story does have a good ending. The next day, I immediately spoke to the manager and told him what happened. The manager was not happy and said he will have a serious talk with the employee. However, it doesn't stop there. An employee who works there and has seen me there for a while now, also heard about what happened (probably from the manager setting Kevin straight), and he immediately had my back.\n\nHe told me that he also reprimanded Kevin and said that his behavior has no excuse and that he can't be treating people like that. A few days after, I ran into the manager, and he asked how I was doing. I thanked him for talking to Kevin, and we shook hands and he gave me compassionate smile, almost as if you could feel how seriously he took the situation. Thank goodness for people who aren't afraid to do the right thing.\n\nHonestly, it's frustrating dealing with this kind of stuff, especially when you're accused of something you didn't even do.  While I am happy that I stood up for myself and that others had my back, I will not be going back to the store late at night when Kevin is working there (if he is still working there, that is).

My autistic teen is really hyperfocused on witchcraft lately and has been stoked about visiting all the shops. In one shop the woman working the counter was really amazing, telling him cool stories behind a lot of the herbs they sell. He bought a book from her shop, refused a bag to save waste, and we went merrily on our way to the next shop. \nNext shop he picked out a somewhat expensive wand and I picked out a pretty candle. We go to check out and the shopkeep tries to ring us up for the book in my husband's hand (my son passed it to him to hold while he looked at the wand). Completely honest mistake, so we just showed her our receipt and figured that would be it. It was not. She took the book from my husband and kept saying it's her book and that \"we have a problem\". Her reason was that she said the price on the receipt is different than the book. Confused, we said that was really weird. We just bought it from a shop a few minutes ago and it is the receipt that we were given. She threatened to \"go review the video\" and we said great! That would be great! It will show my son was literally reading it as we walked in the door and we can get on with it. At this point my husband and I are still being patient and figuring this will be a simple thing to clear up. It's busy and we understand mistakes happen.\n \nShe goes back to just saying over and over that \"we have a problem\" and that she knows it's her book. I am getting frustrated and say that's a bit much, it's a common beginning witchcraft book that is sold in practically every single shop we've been in and we literally have the receipt. She is insisting that we took it from her store because the price on the book is different than the receipt (receipt has the title of the book printed btw). She has the book in her hand and refuses to give it back. My son begins getting really agitated and my daughter begins to cry. I tell them to go wait outside. My husband is insisting she check her video and she is refusing now saying that she just knows it's her book because of the price difference. Now we feel like we are crazy so we start going through every bag we have thinking perhaps we did pick up her book by mistake. No book. Now we are at a standoff, she will not give us the book back even though we have the receipt in hand. We are getting frustrated, it's been a few minutes of this back and forth and we now just want the book so we can leave and skip the purchases. I ask my husband to let me check the receipt and it says the title of the book and 28.99 as the price, I say this and she says no it says 26.99. I look again, no it says 28.99 and hand it back to her. She inspects the receipt for a minute then pulls another customer in (there is a crowd waiting to be checked out) to look at our receipt. That person also says it's 28.99. The shopkeep looks very angry for some reason then starts actually yelling at us that we're supposed to have a bag from the shop that sold it to us (wtf?). Now my husband has gotten to the end of his very long rope and tells her that as long as we have a receipt there is no bag requirement. We have given her the proof of purchases and we want that book back. She gives it back and continues to berate us for not having a bag. I say we're done here and never mind the 90.00 purchases, we are leaving. Get this... she starts screaming \"No! I'm throwing you out! Get out!\" and starts coming around the counter at us.

She 14 & was demolishing it so capable of giving me feedback. \n\nThen I opened my box. I'd only ordered the margarita to keep costs down - \u00a310.50.

I.E. a 60-dollar shirt for 3 dollars. So I wait until the clearance sales and swoop in and get a wardrobe for the following year *cheap*.\n\nMy first card expired (I thought) so they sent another one. And then about 6 months later, they sent *another* one. So I go to the store and they say that none of them work even though I activated them. I want to just cancel out the cards and start over. Nope, you have to call the 1-800 number, they can't do that in the store.\n\nSo, I call and after all the security wall crap, I finally get a human. They say they'll send me *another* card but cannot close out the old cards because they don't see that information (even though I'm giving them the card numbers). I have an account still, I just don't have a working card. So when I go to Nohl's, they just look up my account and charge things to it. Odd, but it works.\n\nA couple years pass, I'm busy building a new house and moving, so have not gone to Nohl's for a while but then seeing as my clothes are wearing out, I decide to go to the clearance sale with a 30% off coupon and some old Nohl's bucks. \n\nI get my merch and approach the counter, I lay all three cards in front of the cashier and say \"Try all of these, I don't know which one is correct.\" He tries, none of them work, he looks me up, I have an account, but none of the cards are on file. So, we charge the stuff to my account, I get a ton of clothes for 30 bucks and I move on. He hands me a little card and says \"Call this number, they will fix this problem for you. Why they can't do this in the store? Who knows?\n\nIf you are still reading, you know what's coming. \n\nYep, I go home and call the 800 number, go through the security crap again, get a human, she has a heavy accent, but tries to help me. Nope, none of those cards are on file, she can send me ANOTHER new card. But she must send me a security code first. OK, that's great, do that. The message comes in, but all it says is \"Thank-you, Goodbye\". She was supposed to call me back in a minute or two to get the code from me, but she never called back. Hmmm. \n\nSo, I guess I'll wait another year and try again to see what happens. Or I'll just wait for Nohl's to go bankrupt and close all the stores, whichever comes first.

During covid I'd go get us takeout and enjoy a drink at the bar while I waited, because I was itching to get out and he wasn't quite comfortable with dining out yet. Even now that we dine out again, me getting takeout and a drink at the bar while I wait has kind of become \"our thing.\" Still cheaper than Doordash and all the $$ goes to the restaurant!\n\nI ordered a margarita. I **did not** start a tab or give the bartender my card. I then ordered two dinners and an appetizer that a Google Review said to try. My bf and I do order more items the first time we try a new restaurant. The to-go boxes came and so did my bill. It was more than I expected but I also know food costs have been high. But as I checked, I saw charges for two margaritas. Let's call this the OG bill.\n\nI politely told the bartender. She had that look like, \"Oh shit I don't quite know what to do,\" and mumbled something like, \"I already...\" (did something to finalize the bill on her computer? Idk). She ran something and gave me a void slip. Then she gave me a new receipt with the new total. Perfect \ud83d\ude42. This is when I handed her my card, and I cannot stress that enough. \n\nTuesday I checked my bank account ... it posted BOTH BILLS -- the OG bill, nearly $70 (which says pending). And the one I paid, which was almost the same amount because I still tipped well. For the sake of simplicity, I almost paid $140 for dinner Monday night. I called the restaurant and explained my situation. The bartender answered and said she remembered me, I was kind of hoping to reach anyone else. She kind of awkwardly said, \"so your card DID get ran twice,\" but assured me the OG Bill was voided and should \"go away.\" She asked if I wanted to talk to the owners but I said I'd wait a few days.\n\nI'm super annoyed and even more confused. If you order dessert and it comes out wrong, and the server says, \"I assure you that dessert won't be on your bill.\" The next day you don't have a charge for the meal + dessert and ANOTHER charge for the meal minus dessert, because \"the first was voided.\" I literally just wanted her to remove an item. That was it. And she didn't even have my card until AFTER she gave me the CORRECT total, so how did the OG bill get ran?????\n\nThe charge just going away is not how *banks* work. I called my bank this morning because, sure enough, OG Bill is still posted. Assuming it WAS voided, the OG charge will finally \"go away\" Thursday around 8 p.m. I get paid Friday.

Yet she was still cussing up a storm and just wouldn't listen. So he grabbed a crazy bread and a garlic sauce and brought them out to me. Said he makes crap pay too and understood why I was upset. He apologized a few times and said he would explain it to the manager and pay for the crazy bread he brought me to keep the cashier from yelling at him. He would make sure the manager knew it was a mistake on their end not mine. So I told him I was sorry he was having to deal with the cashier and I understood it was a simple mistake not to worry about it but I would be calling on Monday about the cashier cussing my out and explain she should at least be in the back not dealing with customers if she couldn't deal with things without being rude to a paying customer. \n\nSo now I feel bad for the young boy having to deal with the crazy lady and will complain on his behalf when I call in for my money back.

I order for my workplace, obviously the credit card I use isn't mine it belongs to the director of the company (as I'm sure happens for a large percentage of their business customers; the go-fer making the orders for printer paper and highlighters isn't the one forking out of pocket  for the company's supplies).   We order two office chairs, unpack and set up the first one, but I'm short and this chair is too big to give me decent back support. I have a look on their website and they have a design-your-own ergonomic chair product with three different style backs and three different seats, as well as a range of nice colours (and a few boring or yuck ones) including a lovely match for our new office d\u00e9cor.  So I ask my boss about returning the unopened chair and getting a colourful one, he likes bright colours and says to go for it.   \n\nI check the invoice for the still-sealed chair, still within their return window and it also says that online purchases can be returned in any store location - yay, 5 minutes up the road so off I go on my lunch break with the unopened chair and a copy of the invoice.   \n\nAfter waiting ~20 minutes for them to find a staff member that can process a return, they get it done.  Not being the original cardholder, they can't do a refund in cash or to a different card, so issue it as a gift card - fine, they still have what I want to buy with the refund, no problem.  \n\nI head down to the office chair section, try out the ergonomic design-your-own, pick the seat and the back that best suit my back and the budget, and go to check out colours.  They only stock a 5 of the colours in store (boring, boring, boring, bright clash with office decor, and a colour that looks like it's come out of a sick child's nose).  I ask an employee about the other colours, they stay they only stock the 5 basic colours, but they're a small store. I could try another store, or order online.  No problem, and the 8-meter high in-store ad for these chairs says I can order the other colour options online.

The suitable colour with back and seat I want are only available in a combination with base and arms that cost $60 more than I have the budget to spend.  Oh dear.

But I can't help you, you can't redeem a gift card by phone!\"    \nOkay, maybe the staff at the store were looking at the wrong system and were using their store checkout system and didn't search in the \"kiosk\" that the grouchy lady mentioned.

I outline the problem, and suggest maybe they can find a way that I can make a click-and-collect COD order online so I can make the order but pay on pickup, or they redeem the card and apply it as a credit to the business account so I can do the online order, or if there is a way I can put the item in the cart of the online account and in-store staff would be able to see it to finalise the order? Or any other way that worked for them. I get an auto-reply that they \"are experiencing delays and high demand\" and it may take longer than usual to follow up.  Righty-o. \n\nBack in store.  Ask for a kiosk order. No can do. Can't find the products, even when I bring up the online account on my phone and show them the item numbers on the pieces in my cart.  \"I'm sorry, I don't know why she told you that on the phone.  Through covid and the lockdowns they were doing gift card redemptions by phone since customers couldn't come in store, I can't see why they'd not be able to do that anymore\".  \n^(Edit to add, because people have asked:) Then I have a lightbulb moment, and ask if I do an online order for click-and-collect, pay with my own credit card, then when the chair gets to the store I cancel that order for a refund to my credit card.  As the store then has the chair I want I can buy it with the gift card.  No, I'm told.  That won't work because if they can't see the product in their system to order, then they won't be able to scan it in to perform a refund or an in-store transaction. \n\nOkay, now this is kind of getting old.   \n\nMaybe the in-store guy was right about the phone redemptions but the grouchy lady was new and just didn't know how to do it?  I call again, speak to a bright cheery young woman and after explaining everything she speaks to her supervisor a couple of times, confirms to me that I can't use a gift card by phone, but I should be able to in-store.  I explain that I've tried twice so she looks up the product codes on her end, and tells me there's x amount in the warehouse, and asks which state I'm calling from and tells me how many are in store (at a couple of locations that are at least an hours' drive from me).  She then takes my name, contact details, business account number, and confirms the product codes and descriptions of the individual pieces I wanted, and promised me her supervisor would follow up and phone me the next day.   \n\nNext day I get a voicemail from the supervisor (I was on a call when they phoned) confirming that they'd spoken directly to the store manager and I could definitely go in-store, go to the counter, give them the product numbers of the parts I wanted to order, and they could make this order for me with the gift card payment.  Great, it's confirmed.  It's been unnecessarily painful getting here but I'll finally get my order.  \n\nProblem.  I get instore, speak to the counter staff, who can't find the products in their kiosk.  The kiosk that I was told was confirmed they would definitely be able to use to make my order for the product numbers I had given them. They call over the more senior guy again, he remembers me, apologises again.  I tell him I was specifically told by the supervisor that had the product numbers and had spoken to the manager of the store that it was possible to make my order in store.  Senior guy goes to speak to the manager, comes back, apologises again and says the manager (who's obviously too cowardly to come to the counter and tell me to my face that he's half-arsed his job, told the caller whatever he thought would get him off the phone quickest and otherwise couldn't give a stuff) didn't know what the order was for when he spoke to the other guy and they still couldn't see it in their system.  He tries one more thing, then looks again tells me the item code shows a prefix that means it's a \"deleted line\" and I won't be able to order it as they won't be getting any more in.  Maybe they won't get any more, but they still have to sell the stock they have, right? And I know they had stock because the girl I spoke to the day before told me exactly how many they still had in their warehouse.  I grab my phone and show him they are still available.  \n\"But you won't be able to order it, it won't let you add it to your cart\" - it's in my cart.  \"It won't let you go to check-out\" I'm in the check-out. \"Well it will error when you try to select delivery location\" - nope, I'm logged into the account and delivery store is already selected. \"Well it won't let you go to the payment page\" - my order is at the payment page.  It's going to let me order (if I want to put in my credit card and pay again - which I don't).   At this point I'm saying very little because I'm incredibly frustrated and the store staff are nice and are trying their best and don't deserve to cop a serve because their company's systems are shit.  So he apologised one more time and I left.    \n\nNow, I've spent a lot of time on this going back and forward, and while I could just get a boring black or toddler-mucus coloured chair, I feel like with the effort I've gone to and the lunch breaks I've wasted so far I should be able to get what I want.  That thing they sell, with the money that they already have.   So I try the 1300 number one more time and reach a woman of such abrasive demeanour that the first woman I spoke to was practically Glinda the Good Witch of the North by comparison.  I start out by explaining that I'm really frustrated as I've been back and forth from store to phone to store to phone to store to phone again, and just wanted to speak to someone who could help me.  I think what she must have heard when I said that was some sort of depraved insult about her mother, because she was more abrasive than a sheet of 20-grit sandpaper the whole time we were speaking.  I explained the issue, she barked that gift cards could not be used online (duh) or by phone (duh again), and when she started telling me that they could do a kiosk order in-store I tried to tell her that I'd been in store three times and they cannot, and she raised her voice and almost yelled \"__*Can I finish what I was saying??*__\".  Well I guess she told me.  I stayed silent while she wasted her breath talking in circles for 3-4 minutes, lecturing at me like a naughty toddler that they could do a kiosk order, the only way to redeem a gift card was in-store and the staff would do that on the kiosk, \"you know, the kiosk, that computer terminal looking thing you walk past in there\", that they can't redeem gift cards by phone or online, it had to be done at the kiosk.  When she finished her little rant, I said \"Like I *tried* to tell you, I have been in store **3 times** and they are **not** able to order this for me on the kiosk. I'm calling to see if someone in your company can help me purchase the product that I want, *that you sell*, with the *money you already have*.\"  She asked me for the product codes, said she could see them in her system and basically accused me of lying when she said her system is exactly the same as the one they look at in the store.  Then she told me they were discontinued and I wouldn't be able to order them anyway.  So ensued a repeat of the conversation I had in store: \"You can't add it to your cart... well you can't see it in checkout... well you can't get it delivered... well it won't go to payment...\"   \nI tell her that they might not order new ones, but the woman I spoke to previously told me how many they have in the warehouse and other stores so I knew that they had ~50 or more. At this point I'm getting frustrated again.  I tell Mrs 20-Grit that I don't care how poorly designed their stock management system is or how badly integrated it is with their client-facing website or their in-store check-out or ordering systems - the deficiencies in their back end IT are not their customers' problem. They already have my (boss') money and I just want someone to help me get what I want with that money.  Can't one person just make a phonecall to the warehouse and ask another person to grab items x, y & Z and put them on a truck to a store??  No, I'm told. That's not possible.  Why not? It just isn't.  Fine, I have the gift card, the original invoice for the first chair & the Visa card number that was used to make that first payment - please put me through to someone that can cancel the gift card and refund the value of it to the card that was supplied for the online order. \"Please hold.\" Wait, what? She's actually going to transfer me? Okay, perhaps some satisfaction out of this after all.    \nAfter a few minutes of obnoxious hold music, Mrs 20-Grit comes back on the line. Does not answer the question about refunding the gift card at all, just repeats that gift cards can't be redeemed by phone, and the design-your-own chairs are online only then tells me I should just choose something else.  I asked her to confirm that the company had my money, and had items I wanted to buy with that money, but wasn't going to find a way to help me do that? She just repeated \"choose something else\".   I hung up.  \n\nI was so mad.  There was a feedback form that popped up on the web page I was look at with the chair.  Feedback? Okay then.   \nI explain it all, the merry-go-round trips from store to phone to store to... (well, you read it), the different stories from everyone, the \"miscommunications\" between the store staff and head office.  I ask for any assistance in redeeming the card for the chair I want - phone the warehouse and manually ask for the items to be sent to the store? Find a way for me to do an online order COD? Apply the gift card balance as credit to the business account? Find someone who still knows how to do the lockdown times phone-redemption of the card?  Any other way they like, I don't even care if they put it through their system with the description of 200 notepads and then just go to aisle 5 and grab an invoice book off the shelf to hand-write me the receipt for the chair - it can't be impossible, right?   \n\nDo I want a response to my feedback from the company? Yes. Yes I do. By phone. I'll hear back from them within 5 business days.   \n\nNope.  No response from my first online Contact Us submission, no follow-up from the feedback form a week later. This company clearly just doesn't give a shit.    \n\nIs continuing this endeavour pointless? Maybe.  But I'm frustrated at the amount of effort so far, and I want my damn coloured chair.  My local store is small, maybe a larger store carries more colours in stock? I drive 20 minutes away, not with high hopes, but I could have fallen over sideways when I see a Plum seat and a Plum back on the shelves.  They must have been in-store returns of an online order. Slightly different styles to the ones I was after, and not the Teal colour that I wanted, but it was a complementary colour that didn't look like snot (and if my boss doesn't like it I'll surrender and buy a grey one in store and take that home). Only that store didn't have any arms or bases. Whatever, I've got my coloured chair.  The next nearest store was a further 20-minute drive, and had the base and arms, and all together the different styles leaves me with $11 on the gift card instead of paying an extra $20 out of pocket.    \n\nPoints to the manufacturer of the chair too, it was very easy to put together and is soooo much better for my back.   But lordy, I'm never buying from this office supply company again.   \n\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you for sticking it out.  If you haven't, well, enjoy the rest of your Friday anyway.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1665141846.0},{"title":"I'm sorry, even though the concert is 1000 miles away and the tickets 2 weeks late almost the day-of... they arrived tho.","author":"xxfay6","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/xyccpb\/im_sorry_even_though_the_concert_is_1000_miles\/","text":"The way this whole order went through, it honestly feels like I've been legally scammed out of $589.\n\nA family friend asked me to buy her tickets for a concert that happened on 10\/04, and for whatever reason the site used USD despite that not being the local currency (I have a USD account tho, which is why I helped). This is one of those major concert from an international band that only went to the capital, and since they lived in the other side of the country it obviously implied traveling.\n\nTickets were bought 08\/29, over a month away. Delivery date was stated as 09\/15. Seems quite reasonable, so in goes the purchase.\n\n09\/15 comes and goes, no signs of tickets. Seems like they only have an international 800 number, so I call that. When it asks for my order number, as soon as I typed the first number it started transferring me. Phone agent basically just said \"Concert needs to be 1 week away before we can look into anything, kindly bugger off\".\n\n09\/26, I *finally* get a tracking code, forwarded to my friend next day. What I had failed to notice, was that the package was send as \"Saver Ground\" and was scheduled to arrive on 10\/06. *The event is on 10\/04.*\n\nOff I go, calling the company again. I get someone who does seem genuinely interested to help, but after some 15 minutes on hold they are only able to refer me to a *different company* that apparently is the real service provider for my country. Whatever, no harm to try. Call the other company, phone tree will only let you through unless you have an order that's at least 72h away. Otherwise, they'll just hang up on you.\n\nDecided to try the website, logged in using the same FB account just fine and my order showed up as well, so it's at least a good indicator that I may be on the right track. Sent in a support ticket that way, got a response a few hours later (interestingly, with the other company's header) saying that they'll look into it.\n\n09\/30, I get a very distressed call. Turns out, since they had already asked for the time-off, they decided to buy plane tickets towards a completely different destination. While they were already in the airport, turns out that her mom had received the event tickets.\n\n10\/01, phone lines supposedly open up for me. *WTF they don't work on weekends?* Tried the 800 international number, works just fine. And here I'm faced with the most obvious issue: Well, they 'did' arrive, they arrived 'on time', and they were 'received' by someone. Doesn't matter that it was 2 weeks late, right smack on the eve of the event, and to *the other side of the country*. After insisting quite a lot, I did get a request for escalation noted on the order, including an email by them acknowledging the request.\n\n10\/03, nothing so far. Finally got to call the supposed company's local number, only for them to refer me back towards the *original company* again. Called the original company, and they basically ask me \"If you were going to travel, why did you not call before and share your travel plans with us? We can make accommodations to make sure that they'll arrive to where you are.\"\n\nUhhh... EXCUSE ME?\n\n* They sent an email about it shortly after the purchase, but the button to write that out only opens up an unrelated FAQ (explaining paper tickets) that doesn't even touch upon travel plans nor mentioned calling them.\n\n* When I called on 09\/15, they **REFUSED** to check on my order and provide any help. No questions or anything, I even mentioned that the address was on the other side of the country, no response.\n\n* When I called on 09\/27, the only seemingly helpful phone agent saw the different addresses and remarked about the situation. I also mentioned it as something that would be plainly obvious, but we were mostly centered around the delivery date.\n\n* That same agent dropped a very interesting bit. Even though the original company had a 09\/15 date, and the other company literally said \"delivery no later than 09\/17\", the seller actually had until **09\/23** to send them off. Even then, they didn't do so until *3 days later* and they used fucking ground shipping despite the website saying they were to use next-day.\n\nDespite all this, *nobody did nothing wrong*. Except myself, for not calling earlier (when I couldn't) to notify about my travel details.\n\nIn my view, there's just no way I see that this could've gone right.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1665182240.0},{"title":"Just give me a lid please","author":"thatgirl21","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/xy4ece\/just_give_me_a_lid_please\/","text":"There is a local sandwich shop next to my work that I frequent pretty much every Friday for lunch.

For a place with a bar, a flat-top and deep fryer, and a bunch of pool tables, it's pretty family friendly.  While not every seat is full it's pretty crowded and a lot of the pool tables are in use.  People of all ages.\n\nAll of the sudden on my right I hear \"HACK! HACK! HACK!\" a truly impressive set of coughs.  Epic.  They easily cut through the crowd noise.  I honestly can't come up with just the right set of syllables and vowels to convey what they sounded like, but it was something like a cross between a donkey-bray and the bark of an ancient but fierce she-dog.  I'm not a medical professional, but it was the kind of sound I would associate with someone on their death-bed.\n\nNaturally I look; it's a little girl of about five, followed by her mom, on their way back from the restroom.  How that noise could come from someone that small is beyond me.  Bless her heart, she's coughing into her elbow, so Mom and Dad get some points for that.  \"Whooping cough\" crosses my mind, although I don't think the sound is quite right, and I wonder about sufficient distance for avoiding air-borne droplets.  By the time they get back to their table (where there is, I'm assuming, Dad and another little girl) she has let out two more strings of three of these colossal, barking coughs.\n\nThey stay there for quite some time, well into the second half of the 12:00 game, and every five-ten minutes, there's another mighty \"HACKK! HACKK! HACKK!\"  Other than sounding like she's going to turn herself inside out, the girl seems fine and mom and dad seem nonplussed, but it's so loud it's difficult not to look.\n\nEventually I notice that there haven't been any coughs for a while; the crowd is thinning out and when I look the family is gone too.  The game is close and I've gotten interested and by the time we get down to the last five minutes, I'm one of the only ones there.\n\nOne of the servers, A., walks by.  He's sweeping up.  I don't know him very well, mostly I run into him in another place I frequent that's not open on Sundays.  He's a very even-keel kind of guy, looks like he might be from the Islands, but speaks with an accent that sounds vaguely Eastern European.\n\n\"So that family with the little girl who sounded like she was spreading the plague finally left,\" I said to him.\n\nHe'd waited on that table.  \"Yeah, her mother said she'd taken her to the doctor's a couple of times, and the doctor says it's just a cough.\"\n\n\"It sounded terrible,\" I replied.\n\n\"She said she was starting to kind of feel like a bad mother, because people kept looking.\"\n\n\"We were,\" I replied.

I agree, and proceed to put my card in the machine. \n\nI had issues trying to get it to take it, but after a minute the option is popped up for me to start pumping. I pick my gas and stick the nozzle into the tank, notice after a few minutes it stops right at $20. Weird, but whatever, more than enough for my car.\n\nAt this point the gas attendant comes outside waving his arms and hollering to me. I freeze, wondering if I broke something.\n\nAttendant: \u201cMa\u2019am, can you come inside please?!\u201d\n\nMe: -stuttering- \u201cO-o-of course! I\u2019m sorry, did I do something?\u201d\n\nAttendant: -now his turn to be awkward- \u201cNo,no, you took someone else\u2019s gas!\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m even more confused as we walk inside together and he explains what\u2019s going on. Another customer had paid for his gas inside, but insisted on parking his car in a parking spot instead of pulling up to the pump. The attendant had been confused and asked the guy if he was filling up a gas can? Nope, it\u2019s gas for his car, but he doesn\u2019t want to pull up to the pump.\n\nSo we get inside and the standing there furious. He accuses me of stealing his gas and me, being confused, tell him no. \n\nGuy: Why did you start pumping?!\n\nMe: -just as confused as the attendant- I\u2019m sorry, I was trying to pay. \n\nAttendant: Miss, can I charge $20 to your card for another gas pump? Since you already pumped that amount?\n\nMe: -glad there\u2019s an easy way to fix the situation- Of course, I\u2019m sorry! \n\nSo I pay and my brother walks up hearing the commotion. Another argument then ensues of Guy not wanting pull up to the other gas pump, he wants me to move MY car so he can pull up to that one. Attendant tells him no, he can go to the one that\u2019s on the other side and fill up his tank. \n\nGuy: But she stole my gas!\n\nAttendant: -exasperated at this point- Sir, she just PAID so you can get YOUR gas. It was a mistake, I told you to pull up your car. I warned you this would happen!\n\nGuy: I want my money back!!!\n\nAttendant: There\u2019s no refunds, go get your car before the pump returns the money. \n\nGuy: -ignored attendant and turns to me- You need to pay for my gas!!\n\nMe: Sir, I just did. I was just trying to pay at the pump, I didn\u2019t realize you already had. \n\nGuy then keeps on this line of accusations, at this point my brother got sick of it and got in between us. He had his back to me and was facing Guy, clearly angry. \n\nBro: You can leave now, sir. \n\nGuy: I ain\u2019t leaving\u2019 without my money. \n\nBro: -very angrily and calmly- She already paid, sir, you can leave now. \n\nGuy: I want my gas!!!\n\nBro: -louder now- YOU CAN LEAVE NOW!!\u2019\n\nAttendant: Out, OUT!! Get out!\n\nGuy basically bolted out the door cursing us out and got in his car. My brother is pissed and stands by the door, watching Guy in case he tries to come back in. The attendant apologized to the both of us for the confusion, says he knows I wasn\u2019t trying to steal the gas because he saw me trying to pay at the pump. \n\nOnce my brother feels comfortable enough Guy won\u2019t come back he grabs our snacks and apologizes to the attendant for yelling in his shop. The attendant tells us we\u2019re both fine, tells us to take our snacks and drinks free of charge, thanks me for paying for the gas, and tells us to have a good day. \n\nIt was really bonkers situation, still have no idea what Guy thought he was trying to do.\n\nTDLR:I try to pay for gas, accidentally take someone else's. Guy accuses me of stealing despite refusing to pull his car up to fill up his tank.

TL;DR-Ordered from a popular meal delivery service, someone else\u2019s package in my box upon delivery (I know, laugh it out) ended up throwing out several days worth of dinner on International Food Loss & Waste Awareness Day.\n\nThe UN designates September 29 as the International Food Loss And Waste Awareness Day\u2026 and boy does the irony of that resonate given my experience today!! \n\nI kept seeing ads everywhere for a meal delivery service-let\u2019s call it Cooks Bowl (CB from now on) and given they had a GREAT introductory offer, we went ahead, picked out some options, got it all set, placed the order to be delivered today. We were so excited to try a couple of these recipes!! I didn\u2019t pick up groceries because I knew this was coming today. \n\nSo, on to today!! I hear a faint knock at the door and go down, I open it in time to see a courier truck drive off, we shall call them Ed-Fex (EF for short). I turn to look at the package and\u2026 it\u2019s clearly been through some stuff. Dented, wrinkled, and what seemed extra tape. I take pics and bring the box in. The tape situation is really weird, and when I get the box open I see why-my package has clearly been opened at some point because SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S PACKAGE IS INSIDE MY PACKAGE!! All this person\u2019s info clearly there on the label, and their box is damaged\/opened as well. \n\nSo I call EF and speak to a very lovely customer service rep (thank you Sylvia!!) who is just as confused as I am. During the conversation I mention that I\u2019m not comfortable eating any of this food as I have zero way of knowing if there\u2019s been any tampering aside from putting a stranger\u2019s package in my box (go ahead and laugh here, I know how that sounds), and Sylvia agrees with me. She\u2019s going to contact the local EF shop and someone will get back to me. She also says that there\u2019s no return option for them with CB so I\u2019ll likely have to throw the food all the way out.\n\nOk, next is CB. Call them, again get a very nice human named Ryan. He joins Sylvia and I in the WTF club, and then says the best he can do is credit my account ON THE NEXT FULL PRICE BOX. Yeah\u2026. Well the issue with that is twofold-that doesn\u2019t help me replace the food I was counting on for the rest of the week, and also I have a couple discounted boxes left because of the great intro offer. But that\u2019s the best Ryan can do, which is actually a lot considering the alien package has EF labels on it so this most likely had nothing to do with CB. But at the end of the day I had to throw out several days worth of dinners so I\u2019ll just delete my account and not count on couriered food again.\n\nAs I\u2019m looking at that box full of culinary dreams and delicious food I start to think-gosh, this is a LOT to throw out\u2026. That little voice starts saying nothing LOOKS obviously tampered with so maybe\u2026. I decided to get a second opinion so I called my lovely SO and told him I need him to be the voice of reason for a minute. After we laughed and laughed, I explained and he saw the conundrum but we agreed to throw it all out and just not take the risk.\n\nThis would seem to put an end to the saga, right?!?! Uuhhhh nope!!! EF has been quietly working in the background (I\u2019ve had texts and phone calls from two further reps from the local depot) and a driver arrived to pick up the package for the person I don\u2019t know. She says \u201cI hear I mis-delivered a package this morning?\u201d All chipper and stuff. I say \u201cDude, you don\u2019t know the half of it!\u201d And explain everything, she promptly joins the WTF club. Then she springs this on me \u201cWould you like to refuse the package (meaning my CB box)? I can take it back to the depot and they can figure it out from there\u201d. Well, see, this was never presented as an option before, and unfortunately the food is in the garbage and packaging is in the recycling so that\u2019s not a possibility now!!\n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m out a small amount of money (thanks to a truly good discount), a lot of time because all customer service reps REALLY like the hold button, and now need to meal plan and shop. I\u2019m definitely not saying all meal delivery services are bad, I\u2019m not even saying this one is, I\u2019m just putting this out there in case anyone is considering this type of service. For myself and my family, no more meal delivery services!!\n\nAlso, be nice to the customer service reps!! They certainly weren\u2019t the ones kicking the stuffing out of my CB package, and they also weren\u2019t the ones to place someone else\u2019s package into my box (laugh again, go on).

I had counted it several times, faced all the bills, etc. \n\nHand it to the teller, say \"this is $400 in twenties and tens\" \n\nWhat then proceeded was the most agonizing five-ish minutes of my life. I watch him slooooowly try to count the bills, then give up and start grouping them on the counter in front of him. He puts down 4 twenties. Stares at it. I see him mouthing numbers to himself. He hesitantly puts another twenty on the pile. Then he starts on the next pile. Again 4 twenties, followed by a long confused moment of trying to figure out if that adds up to $100. \n\nThis continues. Then he gets to the tens. I watch him slowly put 11 tens in a pile.

The restaurant was pretty dead since it was between lunch and dinner rushes. The dining room was also pretty empty when we got in, and we were told to sit anywhere. We sat at the back of the restaurant (trying to explain it so it makes sense) on the higher level - like where you go up like 4 steps and are separated from the regular floor by a couple feet and a railing. Hope you get what I'm trying to say, since it's part of the story.\n\nAnyway, right after we order drinks two older women (60's?) come in and for some reason choose to sit \"under\" us. So basically if I looked down through the railing I could see their table. The one was LOUD, you know the kind. As her friend flipped through the menu, she kept commenting on the prices, but LoudLady kept telling her not to worry about it.\n\nWe ignored them for the most part. Our food came, their food came. Towards the end of the meal the LoudLady said, \"it's time for our discount!\" Curious, I was looking now. She goes in her purse, pulls out a little strip of paper. Then I see she's unwrapping a blue bandaid. She puts a drop of ketsup on the pad part, presses it down a little, crumples the bandaid a bit, then tucks it into the small pile of food left on her plate. She tells her friend her nephew works here, she got this tip from him. So she's clearly going to complain about \"finding\" a bandaid in her food to get the meal comped.\n\nI had to go to the bathroom, which was on the 'regular' floor. As I pass the bar, I see my server with a guy in a dress shirt and tie. I assume the manager. I tell them what I witnessed - just like a 'heads up' kind of thing. Sure enough, by the time I come out I see the server and manager by LoudLady's table. I take my time walking back because I want to see what's happening. LoudLady is insisting she found the bandaid in her food, and she knows that restaurants use blue bandaids, so it could only have come from the kitchen. The manager tells the server to go get the kitchen guys. At this point I stop by a nearby pillar to watch the action. \n\nFour guys come out, and the manager asks them to hold out their hands. Two guys had PINK bandages (two had none). Manager tells LoudLady they ran out of the blue bandages a few days ago, and they were using Hello Kitty bandages from the store across the street. \n\nLoudLady was busted.

Called the vet, they told us if nothing changed to bring him in Tuesday (earliest available opening at their office), but if it opened to get him to an animal hospital ASAP. Well, it opened so we got him to a vet ER. (I don't have a car, but my brother had the day off work and offered to drive me.)\n\nI'm  not an idiot. I know how triage works (I'm trained in triage). I know my cat was stable (comparatively speaking). I knew he was going to be at the vet for a long wait (and was right; we were there for almost five hours). And, my brother (the one kind enough to get the two of us to the vet ER) had errands he needed to run in the city. (Had to go to another city in another county; ours doesn't have a vet ER.) So, after Ra was taken back I told them that my brother had errands to run, and asked if we could come back later. \"Oh, no, not until after you speak to the vet.\"\n\nThat makes sense. I'm not saying it doesn't. I had to speak to the vet to approve or disapprove of the treatments they were going to give my cat. Spoke to the vet (Ra had an abscess that burst), approved of the treatment plan, was told again how triage worked, and we asked if we could go (brother didn't feel comfortable leaving me alone in a strange city) run my brother's errands and come back. \"No, it'll only take a few minutes.\"\n\nAt that point we'd been at the vet ER for an hour and a half (not a bad wait time at all). It looked like we were going to be in and out relatively quickly. Then there was an incident at a nearby dog park (not sure what happened, but those puppers really needed to be seen faster than my kitty), so after things were settled with the dogs each in their own rooms\/kennels\/treatment and the front desk staff was calm again (it was all hands on deck with the emergency) I brought up my brother's errands and requested that we come back (they had my contact information, his contact information, and in case neither of us were reachable they had my mother's contact information, so there's no reason we couldn't have done this). The woman I spoke to pulled up Ra's information on her computer and said, \"No, it'll only take fifteen minutes.\"\n\nI wanted to call bull. I *should* have called bull. Ra's life was not in immediate danger, his wound was not in a critical area, and they'd just had a slew of patients brought in *where this was not the case*. But, perhaps, I reasoned, there was a vet already in the middle of treating Ra, and they wanted to finish. So we waited.\n\nMy brother's blood sugar drops really easy, and he'd skipped breakfast to ferry the cat and me to the vet ER. So when we'd been there for three and a half hours *and they weren't letting us leave*, I admit I did wrong and raided the employee break room (more of an alcove with a coffee pot) for snacks. (In my defense, he'd gone pale and clammy and was shaking badly. He desperately needed *something*.)\n\nSo after almost *five hours* of hearing, \"Just a few more minutes,\" we finally get the bill, pay, and get Ra (just in time for the stores my brother needed to visit to close). So that's why I'm upset.\n\nHere's why I'm in awe: Ra is a problem child in the carrier. Too long crated (and I warned them before they took him back) and he starts self-harming.

I picked my daughter up from an event tonight a little after 10. On the way home a light came on saying my tire had low pressure. There\u2019s a gas station on my way home so I stopped there. The card swiper thing on the air pump was not working, so I went inside and asked the guy if it worked with coins, to which he replied yes. I gave him a $5 bill and asked if he could give me $2 in quarters and singles. I also needed cigarettes, but to try avoid confusion, I said \u201cafter that, can I get two packs of my brand of cigarettes, please?\u201d He stops in the middle of it and he decides to do it all in one transaction.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets fun. He tells me that my cigarettes are $16 and change. I give him another $12 on top of the $5 I\u2019d given him to cover the cigarettes, still trying to keep the change transaction separate. He hands me back $2 and tells me to give him another $5 bill. So, if you\u2019re following, I\u2019ve given him $22, he gave me back $2, for a total of $20 that he now has of mine. \n\nBUT, once he hit the total button on his end - after I\u2019d given him the money - it shows that I got a discount on my cigarettes, and they were only $15.10. He stops, looks at the computer confused, then gives me $2 in quarters. As I walk out, I\u2019m realizing that he\u2019s overcharged me. It\u2019s raining, I\u2019m ready to cut my losses and say fuck it, I paid $5 to get air in my tire, whatever, I wanna get it aired up and get home.\n\nWell, of course, the air pump is not, in fact, working and even though I put in the $2, it only registered $1.25. I have no more change, so I go in and let the dude know, and ask if I can get the $0.75 cents that it ate to try to get it going. He immediately gets an attitude and tells me it\u2019s not his issue, he\u2019s not giving me anything, and I can take it up with his boss in the morning because he\u2019s not dealing with it. \n\nAt this point, lm annoyed with him being such an asshole for no reason because I had been nothing but polite up to that point. I know he can\u2019t control the air pump, and wasn\u2019t being shitty about it - literally just asked for the 75 cents it ate to try to start it. So I said \u201cokay, well then can you give me the $2.90 you shorted me on my change hoping I wouldn\u2019t notice and I\u2019ll just use that?\u201d\n\nOooh, ladies and gents, that really pissed him off. He tried to argue with me at first and tell me that he gave me $4 back - to which I responded that he had done that, but he charged me full price for the cigarettes even after the discount was applied, and he knew the change wasn\u2019t right because I watched him stop and stare at the screen trying to figure it out after he did it and he still chose to give me the wrong change. He argued with me for a good 10 minutes, finally took out a piece of paper, and wrote down the math. He then argued with me about how much my cigarettes cost. I asked him to scan them and put my number in. First he tried to do it with a more expensive brand - which I shut down by pointing to the signs right behind him with the price difference. He started yelling at me at that point telling me that I\u2019m a problem and \u201cnever again! I won\u2019t do this again! Next time, NO!\u201d \n\nHe got all smug when it came up as $16 and change, until I asked him to hit the total button, and, what do you know? $15.10. He did the math again and surprise, he shorted me $2.90 - just like I\u2019d told him to begin with. He again started berating me at that point about how \u201cyou ladies give all the problems! Never again! Next time no!\u201d I told him that if he would have a) kept the transactions separate like I was trying to to begin with, b) been honest to begin with and given me the correct change, or c) just given me the damn 75 cents and not been an asshole for no reason, we wouldn\u2019t have been in that situation. He knew he fucked up my change when he did it and still wanted to argue with me about it. I told him that if he had that many problems with \u201cladies\u201d, that he was the common denominator there, and that maybe he was the issue here, not the \u201cladies\u201d who call him on his bullshit. \n\nMaybe it was petty over $3, but his attitude and getting shitty with me when I had been nothing but polite just pissed me off. Not to mention the fact that he damn well knew he did it, and likely would\u2019ve pocketed that money at the end of his shift when he counted down his drawer. Makes me wonder how many other people he does that to in a day and how much he takes home at the end of the night from discounts he never gave people.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1663474170.0},{"title":"Amazing warranty coverage for my lawnmower!","author":"LS-CRX","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/xg1ime\/amazing_warranty_coverage_for_my_lawnmower\/","text":"Back in 2019 when we bought our current house, I decided to go \"all electric\" with my lawncare and bought a trio of 60V lawn  tools (mower, blower, string-trimmer) made by \"Crafty-guy\" and sold by \"Highs\".

I had had my car for 19 years and it had saved my life on several occasions. However I wanted a new and different model. I heard that a different company had something similar, so I made an appointment to go and see it. I wanted a four seater convertible, and the salesman was very nice. Unfortunately, the top was cloth and I really wanted a hard top. So, after about 40 minutes, I went down the street to the dealership for the car I was interested in. I was given \u201cIvan\u201d as the salesman. I explained the car and model I was interested in. Begrudgingly, we went upstairs and we walked around some used models. I wanted to see the interior as well as how much trunk space was left after the top was folded in the trunk. He didn\u2019t have any keys, and he didn\u2019t want to get any. I pressured him and he finally got some. He opened the passenger door so I could see the interior, and then put the top in the trunk. It was obvious that he wanted to get rid of me, so we left to go downstairs to his desk. I excused myself to go to the restroom, which was located in an area in the second floor. Ivan was stunned I knew where it was, but I had already told him that my 19 year old car was serviced there. We went to his desk and he told me they didn\u2019t have any new models, but some were on their way by ship. However, the specs he showed me weren\u2019t for what I wanted so I left.  I had dealt with a dealership 400 miles away (near my son) that I had used to take care of my 14 year old car that I kept down there. So, I called my old service rep who put me in contact with a salesman who was attentive. He found me the right car that was due in port, and I flew down and paid cash. (High 5 figures.). I received the best service. Moral:  don\u2019t judge people by their appearance, you will lose sales. (I hadn\u2019t dressed up when I went to see Ivan, just wearing clean jeans and a nice top.).

I can say, however, that the company sounds an awful lot like \u201cMissan\u201d and the car model sounds an awful lot like \u201cBrogue.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn my early twenties, my father decided to upgrade to a better car, and I had the great fortune of receiving his old car, a 2011 Missan Brogue, for free. Since my then-girlfriend and I were getting pretty tired of taking our bicycles everywhere across our hilly town that, like most places in the US, is not particularly well-suited to traveling by any means other than a car, we were pretty happy. After I picked the car up from my dad, we drove it back home, and I soon began looking into reputable mechanics. I found one, a small shop ran by a friendly lumberjack-looking guy called Mike, and life was good. I would take my car in regularly for oil changes, chat with the service coordinator if the shop wasn\u2019t too busy, and Mike would let me know if anything seemed wrong, even going the extra mile to show me the problem (for example, pointing out the cracks in my serpentine belt when it was around time to get it replaced).\n\n\n\nA year or so later, I noticed something weird happening. Sometimes, the car would lurch, and it felt almost like it was \u2018stuck\u2019 in first gear. I put that in quotation marks because the Missan Brogue doesn\u2019t have a traditional transmission; rather, it uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT), meaning that it doesn\u2019t really have set gears. Nonetheless, that\u2019s the best way I can describe the issue. And, of course, it started happening right around the 62,000 mile mark, just out of the manufacturer warranty period. The issue came and went, and the only way I could get it to reliably go away was to pull over, turn off the car, and turn it back on (IT: \u201chave you tried turning it off and back on again?\u201d).\n\n\n\nWhen next I brought the car to Mike, he told me that unfortunately, because of the specialized transmission, the only way I could get a diagnosis was to take it to the town\u2019s Missan dealership, which had a bit of a reputation. Feeling some trepidation, I did just that the next time it happened. I drove across town, pulled into the shop area, in the process going over some fancy wheel sensors that told me how much tread I had left and whether my tires were aligned, and waited for the diagnosis.\n\n\n\nIt took some time, but the technician came back with bad news: not only did the engine code indicate that my transmission needed to be replaced (for about $2000), but I also needed about $2100 in completely unrelated repairs done on \u201citems requiring immediate attention.\u201d What needed to be done, you ask?\n\n\n\n* Found corrosion on battery. Battery service: $34.95, replace positive end & hold down strap: $76.96\n* Found belt glazed and starting to crack. Replace serpentine belt: $140.98\n* Found oil cooler leaking. Replace engine oil cooler O-ring & PCV valve: $334.20.\n* Found control arm bushings broken. Replace both front lower control arms: $977.89\n* Recommend in-cabin micro-filter replace: $56.67.\n* Found radiator leaking. Replace radiator assembly: $404.27\n* Recommend 4 wheel alignment: $79.95\n\n\n\nMore than a little freaked out, I called my dad and sent him the list that spelled out that my car was about to fall apart. He started asking around his friends to see if anyone could get it done cheaper, and suggested that I take the car back to my regular mechanic for a second opinion. So I call up the shop, let them know what\u2019s going on, and I get an appointment for 2 weeks from then.\n\n\n\nThe day comes, I drop off my car, I get a ride to work, and come back at the end of the day to find out some very interesting news. Namely:\n\n\n\n* The $34.95 + $76.96 for battery service: Mike showed me there\u2019s almost no corrosion on the terminals, and while the battery\u2019s starting to get a little old, there was no reason to replace it yet.\n* The $140.98 to replace the belt: this was the same belt that Mike had put in my car a year earlier, it was still going strong, and Mike showed me that there literally weren\u2019t any cracks in it.\n* The $334.20 to replace the oil cooler: Mike told me that the 2011 Brogue did not, in fact, have an oil cooler to begin with.\n* The $997.89 to replace the broken front lower control arms: Mike walked me under the car, pointed at the front lower control arms, showed me that while they had some normal mechanical stress they were, in fact, not broken, and told me that if they were, I absolutely would have noticed.\n* The $56.67 to replace the filter: actually, this one he admitted I probably needed since it'd been a year since the last time.\n* The $404.27 to replace the leaky radiator assembly: Mike told me he did not find a leak in the assembly. He did find a leak in the radiator cap, which I could replace myself for $10.\n* The $79.95 for 4-wheel alignment: Mike told me the wheels are all in similar condition to each other and there\u2019s no reason to believe they need to be aligned.\n\n\n\nSo, in the end, a $2100 repair turned into a fraction of that. After profusely thanking Mike, and having absolutely no trust in the dealership, I tried to look into other ways to get my transmission replaced. Considering it was a CVT, my options were super limited, and in the end, I just\u2026 didn\u2019t replace it. The issue came and went, I only did city driving, and it was an annoyance more than anything. All in all, it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle, at least to me, to get it replaced, and I continued driving that car for several more years with no other issues.\n\n\n\nEpilogue:\nEventually, my father decided to upgrade his car again, and offered to once again give me his old car. At this point, my car had about 100,000 miles on it, and we were concerned that if I kept driving it, the transmission issue might get worse. So, I happily accepted, and my dad went to work trying to get rid of my car. He went to one dealership and got them to write down a price for the Missan that they would honor only if he bought his new car from that same dealership (giving them leeway to negotiate a worse deal for him on the new car). He then drove to another dealership, presented them with that price without mentioning how he negotiated it, and got them to accept it and also give him a good deal on his new car.\n\n\n\nFin.\n\n\n[ninja edit: formatting]","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661701522.0},{"title":"You\u2019re not allowed to negatively review [named delivery company] without their approval","author":"Rivalry","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/wz9pzj\/youre_not_allowed_to_negatively_review_named\/","text":"As soon as I saw [named delivery company] were delivering my furniture order recently my heart sank.

I'll preface by saying my husband is a kind & gentle person - normally.\n\nLast year my husband was having problems with anxiety. He was put on a med for it by the Dr & his personality started changing. As with all meds, you usually give them at least a couple of week for side effects to go etc. However I was getting concerned. It started off over the first couple of days with him beaming off & not remembering conversations. Then he started shouting at me for no reason. I tried to explain to him how he was behaving but he was oblivious. \nThen the 3rd day he hid his tablets, something he's never done & screamed at me for doing it. I found them underneath a stack of books, so not an accident.\nThen 4 days in, in the evening, before we go to bed he got right in my face and screamed at me for not closing a door. I honestly thought he was going to get physical, I was really scared.\nThe next morning, frightened of how he'd react if I said I'd call the Dr, I looked through the side effect leaflet. Turns out 2 of the second most common side effects are aggression and confusion. I thought since it was there in black & white he might believe me & let him call the Dr to get the med changed. I showed him, he shouted at me that he was fine, again to the point I thought he might hit me, so I went for a walk to call the Dr.\nAt this point we weren't married & not down as having permission to discuss the other ones medical problems. So I explained to the receptionist it was urgent, I was scared for my safety, appreciated it couldn't be discussed but I needed to tell the Dr what was going on, to get him to change the med.\nI get the Dr who is head of the practice, (he was on call), explain the personality change, my fear and expressed that he could be a danger to others too if he went out. The Dr seemed not to be paying too much attention & kept telling me to get my husband to call him. I kept warning him that he doesn't think there's anything wrong with him & if I ask him he's likely to get aggressive. He just said get him to call me.\nSo I go back and told him I'd spoken to the Dr & he wanted him to call him to see how the new meds were. All the while bloody scared he was going to kick off. 'Thankfully ' he was in the confused state when I told him to & he did. \nHe gets the same Dr, I ask my husband to put it on speaker phone so I could check he was being honest with the Dr. He did. \nMy husband starts off by saying my wife is concerned about the side effects of this tablet, Dr butts in and says you're only a few days in, you need to stick with it to see if it works for you!!!!!!! WTAF! Husband then says I've told him he's acting out of character & being aggressive, Dr repeats what he just said. \nIt took 5 more minutes or Dr trying to persuade him to stay on them & my poor confused husband, with some nudging from me, finally gets a different medication. \nI honestly couldn't believe it. I have never called into the Dr's on my husbands behalf, I was his carer with serious concerns about my safety & that of others. \nThis 'Dr' just ignored me.\nSo I called to speak to my Dr, who's in the same practice, who I've had for over 20 years & I trust. She called me back, my thinking was that whilst my situation was sorted he might do this to others. I hate confrontation of any sort, & as this guy is the practice manager, the complaint would go straight to him. \nShe covered her arse by using the 'I'm sorry that you feel....'

I have been going to one we will call Adent for almost a year and have only been able to schedule two appointments in that time. This office has a policy that they won\u2019t book a patient another appointment until they\u2019ve completed the one currently on the books, which resulted in me having to wait 6-8 months between appointments. \n\nNow normally this wouldn\u2019t bother me, but I was told by the dentist (one of many that Work in this office) that I had quite a few cavities that needed addressing, so it became increasingly frustrating to me that it would likely take years before all of the issues were addressed. \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there was an urgent need to patch and resurface an acrylic bonding on one of my front teeth that is a patch for a chip that happened when I was a kid, it had been Chipping away for years and I had recently spit a fairly sizable chunk into my hand after accidentally clacking my teeth together. I had asked specifically to make an appointment to address this and was told that I couldn\u2019t make an appt for that before all of my MORE URGENT cavities were addressed. \n\nJuly rolls around and I finally have another appt for a filling, I arrive at the office and am seated, bibbed and they begin prepping the front of my mouth for novocain which\u2026 I wasn\u2019t expecting. I stop the assistants and ask them what tooth they were told to prepare for, they said the front tooth. I am surprised and say \u201coh ok, I was told that they wouldn\u2019t work on that until the cavities are take care of\u201d she turns to me and says, oh there\u2019s a cavity in that tooth. There has never been a cavity in that tooth, as it\u2019s been mostly covered in acrylic filling material for my entire adult life, and I can see on the X-rays in front of me that there is no shadow or sign of decay. I question her again and she insists, exasperated, and I told her that I thought she might be mistaken and please check again that they have the right charts. She said they did and insisted that they needed to start now or they\u2019d be running very behind on other appts, but my gut was telling me that something was wrong. I\u2019d already had a couple questionable experiences with this office but this just tipped the scales for me. I got up and said I\u2019m going to have to reschedule. This isn\u2019t correct. And walked out to the front desk. The receptionist rescheduled me for sometime in November, which is frustrating but at this point I was already preparing to change my dental provider. \n\nLater that day I called an office I knew took my insurance, let\u2019s call them Gdent. they had an appointment for the following week(miracle) and got my insurance switched over to them. I had my X-rays sent from Adent over to Gdent and sat down for a consultation with my new dentist. I specifically asked him about the front tooth, he said he saw NO sign of a cavity in that tooth, OR ANY OTHERS. He said I have beautiful teeth and very healthy bones with no sign of decay. Told me to just keep doing what I\u2019m doing at home. \n\nY\u2019all, I am SHOOK. I hated going to the dentist to begin with due to some childhood trauma, but this just makes me so angry. I\u2019m so grateful that my new dentist is a kind and thoughtful physician, he clearly works with a lot of anxious dental patients because he talked me through the whole (fast and amazingly well done) process of patching my front tooth. No Novocain necessary. \n\nI suspect that Adent is misdiagnosing cavities so they can bill insurance for more procedures than is medically necessary. This looks like insurance fraud, and I have reported it to the state health authority. \n\nWatch out for sketchy dental practices.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1661267132.0},{"title":"You Can Have Your Private Info Back, But Not Really","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/wvr82r\/you_can_have_your_private_info_back_but_not_really\/","text":"During lockdown I went against my better judgement--dietary and otherwise--and tried to order from Fairy Mean, the burger and ice cream palace.

Fought for a month to get a refund, lost it, and finally got it again.\n\nUPDATE: I received the two Comp night certificates. A few days later I received a letter telling me the comp certificates would not be honored since a check was being sent. Of course they were able to send the certificates and the revocation quickly but still waiting on that check. The credit card dispute remains open waiting on documentation from the chain. For now the financial services company backing the credit card used has reversed the monthly interest charged for the transaction. \n\nFINAL UPDATE \\* The Credit card dispute was closed with the hotel brand again claiming that I wasn't owed a refund because it was non-refundable and I didn't cancel.  Then the refund check finally arrived.  At the end of the day I was overcharged credit card interest because of the way it was refunded, but I'm done - I can't fight anymore.  I lost a few dollars instead of $403.94 for a stay that wasn't honored.  I call hotels for reservations now and use AirBnB - because hotel chains suck.\\*\n\nI just learned the hard way why you should never prepay a hotel room. A month ago, I had two nights prepaid at a Major Hotel Brand which turned out to be overbooked. They called before I arrived to say they were overbooked and had no rooms available, and to ask if they wanted to book me at another hotel. At that point it was easier to stay where I was so I declined, and they told me I should see the refund on my card within a few days.\n\nA week passes, and I don't see a refund, so I call the credit card company since it's a Major Hotel Brand branded card (for the points - guess those are wasted now). They tell me the property must issue the refund. It's late Friday at this point so I leave it until Monday. Monday, I call the property and the front desk tells me only the GM can issue the refund and she'll be in later. I give them my info and of course never get a call back.\n\nI didn't have time to deal with it until the following Thursday. Call the property and just ask for a manager. I get sent to voicemail and leave a terse but polite message with what's going on including my name, my call back number, and the reservation confirmation number, the fact that this is my second call, and a deadline of 3:00 PM the next day to get back to me before I stat a credit card dispute. Still no call.\n\nThe next morning, I call again and explain the situation to the front desk. She puts me on hold for several minutes and then transfers me to the same voicemail without first picking up the line to tell me she's doing it. Now I have no doubt the manager onsite is ducking me.\n\nI go to start the dispute the credit card dispute online and there's another number for the hotel\u2019s online booking customer service on the transaction, so I call them first. The customer service women who took the call opened a case and told me someone would call me back from the property within 72 hours, and then I get an email that says the same thing. Mind you, it doesn't say 3 business days, it says 72 hours, and this is now around 8:00 PM on a Friday 3 weeks after the dishonored prepaid reservation.\n\nMonday passes with no call back again and initially I decided to wait until Wednesday in case they meant 3 business days, but Tuesday morning I decided that was silly, they'd had more than enough time to resolve this and called the online support again. I gave the support tech the prior case number and my other info again. He starts telling me to wait for a call from the property and I reiterate to him again how many unreturned calls I've waited for from the property and the fact that I am on this call, in response to one of those unreturned calls. He tells me he'll submit to get a refund on his end and to still expect a call back from the property GM.\n\nNow Tuesday afternoon, coming up on a month in, I get an email which begins, \"Recently you contacted Major Hotel Brand with your comments regarding your stay at the Major Hotel Brand Specific Flag Somewhere on July 20, 2022. We understand that the hotel has been in touch with you and we wanted to make sure that your concerns were resolved to your satisfaction.\" That's news to me since no such phone call has taken place. While I'm finishing my response to this email my phone rings and the caller ID shows it's the hotel. I answer and resist immediately calling the manager by name, since I've already sussed that out from LinkedIn along with the fact, she works for a company we'll call Owners Name Properties owned by folks who used to own a chain we'll call Defunct Hotel Brand.\n\nShe apologizes for not returning my earlier calls and claims she was at a conference out of town. Pretty sure she was in the office the Friday I got blind transferred to her voicemail, but I just let her know I first called a few weeks ago and the stay that got cancelled close to a month ago and this is the first I'm hearing back from her. She proceeds to try to roll her \"team\" under the bus saying she'll talk to them about why I got bumped. My own real issue is why she didn't issue a refund or return a phone call, but someone who uses the word, \"team,\" the way she does isn't a team player. The person working Night Audit the night my stay got cancelled isn't the person who ducked my calls and falsely claimed a callback had already taken place and that I was satisfied with the result. She proceeds to tell me she can't refund an online purchase - a statement some posts in r\/TalesFomTheFrontDesk seem to support - but she's talked to the online folks and she's issuing me two comp vouchers, \"Good at any Major Hotel Brand Property for any stay.\" I'm not inclined to believe the claimed redeemability of said vouchers. She also tells me she's been in touch with the online folks, and they may issue a partial refund for $200. I am clear that isn't what I want, and this is not a satisfactory resolution. We finish up the call and I consciously resist the urge to reflexively utter the words, \"Thank you.\"\n\nI check my credit card account online, and I see a refund, for more than $200 but clearly in the wrong amount. I edit my response email and make clear I received the call back while initially responding. In the email I began:\n\n>While I was typing a response the hotel finally contacted me. They had not at the point your email arrived.  \n>  \n>They indicated that they could not refund the stay as it was booked advance pay through your website. They vouchered two nights and indicated that a partial refund might be forthcoming from Major Hotel Brand since this was booked through Major Hotel Brand's website.\n\nI also detail how many calls and emails this has taken, that my credit card online shows a refund in the wrong amount, and that there are two customer service cases open on this, note the other case, and I affirmed that anything less than a full refund would result in me filing a credit card dispute. Later that night I went back to the original booking confirmation and determined that the partial refund was double the amount of the first night, so it didn't include the higher rate I was charged for night two, and it didn't include the taxes I was charged. I respond to my earlier email with the additional details.\n\nThis garnered a response Wednesday morning - Wednesday morning of week 4 or 5 in this saga which began:\n\n>Thank you for your reply.  \n>  \n>I am truly sorry for the frustration you have encountered as you are entitled to a full refund.  \n>  \n>Our team does not have access to internal hotel billing and cannot see the amount that has been refunded. In addition, as stated in your email, the hotel incorrectly indicated they could not issue the refund.\n\nThey go on to ask for some confirming documentation, confirmation of my mailing address and affirm that once received they will issue a check by mail to be received within 30 days. I ignore the fact that net 30 isn't great at this point, and how sad it is that because this company is clearly outsourcing everything it is incredibly difficult for this customer to be treated fairly. It\u2019s obvious at this point every manager is going to blame an underling or a different entity because the problem is organizational and plainly the fault of the CEO and COO. I hit snooze on the email so I can be reminded Saturday to follow-up and get back to my real job in the meantime.\n\nSometime in between then and Friday I get an email from my credit card company that my card may have been charged for a purchase it wasn't present for. When I check the credit card online, I see a charge equal to the partial refund, but misread it as just the refund, and think it strange they sent such an email alert for a refunded amount. Friday morning, I receive an email from Major Hotel Brand support referencing both case numbers which reads:\n\n>Thank you for your email response.  \n>  \n>After reviewing your case #nnnnnnnnn (original case #), we are showing that compensation was 2 Be My Guest certificate GInnnnnnnn and GInnnnnnnn for one night each complimentary stay in a standard room at any Major Hotel Brand Specific Flag which will be valid for one year 9\/18\/2023. They were issued on 8\/18\/2022.  \n>  \n>They were mailed to the following address: MY ADDRESS  \n>  \n>We are showing on Case #nnnnnnnnn (second case #) that the refund check was voided due to the hotel compensated your for the Be My Guest certificate. Your refund will not be processed.\"\n\nAt this point I check the credit card account again and correctly see that I was refunded an amount and then charged the same amount again. So now my refund was unceremoniously yanked, and my recompense had been reduced from vouchers valid at any Major Hotel Brand to vouchers valid at 1\/18th of the Major Hotel Brand flags. In my estimation I have been polite up to this point and overly patient. My response to this email is far less measured.\n\nI reply:\n\n>Major Hotel Brand S&\\^$s!  \n>  \n>I didn't ask for comp nights. Take the f$#\\^ing comp nights and shove them up your a%# and issue my f(\\*\\^ing full refund you s(@#heads!\n\nI then open the credit card dispute I have been threatening for weeks.  I indicate in the dispute option that the vendor has stated I am entitled to a full refund. Their online dispute process closes the dispute as soon as I submit and tells me prepaid cancelled reservations are irrefutable but leaves me at a page where I can submit supporting documentation. After several attempts to submit a PDF printout of the entire email I find I can reopen the dispute and instead of noting that the vendor asserted that I am entitled to a full refund I note that the goods and services were not delivered. I was able at this point top successfully open a dispute and upload the email thread where Major Hotel Brand affirmed, after having been informed of the comp nights, that I am entitled to a full refund. It even included their later assertion that I wasn\u2019t entitled to that refund and my instructions on what to do with their comp nights.\n\nOn Sunday I received another reply, again apologizing for how I had been treated, promising a refund check in the full amount, and requiring no more documentation just a confirmation of my address. I replied to confirm my address this morning. I considered apologizing for my outburst but consciously decided against doing so and instead replied with just a single sentence confirmation of my address.\n\nSo, now I'm waiting for a check, and possibly two comp vouchers good at 1 out of 18 Major Hotel Brand flags. I will cash the check before attempting to use the vouchers which have supposedly already been mailed. If I find the vouchers valid and easy to use that may act as some salve for this nonsense, but if I find them irredeemable then I will find the issuer so as well and must assume this last bit in the last email was meant as an ironic joke, \"*Again, I apologize, and hope you'll give us another chance on your future travels.*\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1661196044.0},{"title":"Cockroach in the Steakhouse","author":"ferry120997","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/wvb93z\/cockroach_in_the_steakhouse\/","text":"Me and my boyfriend have been on vacation all week in another state.

Did some shopping and then my pregnant self wanted some food from the girl with the pigtails. It was close by to where we were shopping so we swung in. Last time we were there we had ordered a family size nugget bucket so since we all wanted nuggets we did that again. Also ordered some cheeseburgers and a chicken sandwich and those awesome chocolate milkshakes. \n\nWe waited in a line that took forever. Whatever.

My mom came from my old hometown to spend the day with me- visit some museums, do some shopping, get dinner, stuff like that.\n\nA little backstory: my dad passed away back in 2020, and he wore a very specific aftershave by a certain luxury brand. (They're very well known for a perfume that has a number between 4-6.) Whenever my mom misses my dad, she pulls out his old aftershave bottle and will wear a small spritz of it to remind her of him. Unfortunately, her bottle was nearly out and she wanted to replace it. She also wanted to replace an old favourite lipstick from the same luxury brand- keep in mind this lipstick was purchased probably 20 years ago (yes I know she should've thrown it out but my mom likes what she likes). \n\nWe decided to try out two different stores in the same mall near where I lived- we'll call them Budson's Bay and Hoardstrom Rack. We went to Budson's Bay and the three workers there were all chatting to one another, then fell silent as we approached- one even just left. My mum and I explain what she was looking for, and one of the salesladies (SL) looks at both of them. \n\nSL: Sorry, these were both discontinued.\nMom: Oh, dear. That's a shame. Do you think they might still sell the old aftershave online?\nSL: I wouldn't know. I only know what's in stock here. We have a deodorant version of that if you like.\nMom: That's alright. Do you have a lipstick similar to this shade?\n\nSL opens up the tube and squints, goes over to the lipstick section and pulls out a tube, then hands it wordlessly to my mom. We take a look at it and it's not even close. At this point, I just say thanks to the saleslady and corral my mom out of there. She's a little disappointed but we both hold hope as we go to the makeup counter at Hoarstrom Rack.\n\nY'all. The woman who was there was an absolute *angel*. She listened to my mom and immediately took her to the lipstick section to help her pick out a shade that would be closest. She was obviously super knowledgeable, pulling out multiple tubes and explaining that the shade closest to my mom's was a very popular one and was almost always sold out. Luckily, she found one for her. Then she took her to the cologne counter- she knew as well that my dad's old aftershave had been discontinued but helped my mom try out some similar scents, even giving her the tip that sometimes people sold old cologne and perfume bottles at online auctions. Two scents were close, but just a little bit off, and without prompt, the lady offered to get both scents in sample perfume spritzers that my mom could take home. My mum was near tears as she opened up to this lady about how much she appreciated this, as this was my dad\/her husband's favourite cologne. The woman reassured her that it was the least she could do, and my mom ended up buying a lipstick that was super close to her old shade.\n\nI don't know if it was a commission thing between retailers, or if this woman genuinely just loved her job, but she made the experience truly wonderful.

I explained to the employee I walked 30 minutes with this   box for a refund and I can't carry it back, but she dismissively said   \"No, we're closed\" and then jokingly told the customer in front of me to   turn away anyone who lines up. The other customers in the line give a  weak laugh at that joke. Without further acknowledging me, she walked to  the counter and started processing customer requests. At this point, I  was frustrated because she clearly saw me two steps away before she   closed the line, and then dismissively told me to go away.\n\nI   decided to wait a while at the end of the line, hoping that at least I   can politely beg her to help me out when she's finished. I chatted  with  the guy before me in the line, and he clearly seems uncomfortable  that  he's been tasked with turning people away.

I asked her   what time customer service closed and she said \"8\".\n\nThis was getting frustrating and I wanted to report this incident to corporate because the website never said customer service closes at 8   (even though store hours end at 11 pm) and the employee was dismissive   of my request which would take 1 minute of her time.

I then asked  her  what's her name. She refused to tell me. The manager then came and  I  explained to her that I needed to return an item and it took me a 30   minute walk with the large box to get here. She said they close the   customer service desk at 8 and won't serve me. (At this point, I was   frustrated and angry at how dismissive the other employee was, and I   couldn't think properly.) I asked for the manager's name and she refused  and asked me why. I said it's fine if they don't want to help me, and I  can understand if it's store policy. I'll call corporate to suggest  extending the customer service hours at this store and I have a right to  provide feedback to corporate.

NOT the phones flashlight, just my screen light which was low as I was on low batteries(story of my life).\nAnyways, I saw it was more juicy and tender in the middle and it was really good. I proceeded to eat the whole thing, and it was filling and delicious. \nOur waitress was great and even though the place was busy checked on us a few times but then was gone until we were ready for the check. Which was perfect bc we got to converse and not have any interruptions. \nWhen she did come to bring us the check, she came to me and said hey, the cook said he burnt your steak and your whole meal is comped, plus the glass of wine you had! \nI was really surprised and said, but I ate the whole thing, I didn\u2019t think it was burnt at all, in fact it was really good! \nShe pressed on the fact that it was and he felt bad so the meal and wine was comped. I finally agreed after some back and forth, and my date and I decided to tip her very generously, pretty much he gave close to what my meal would have cost.\nWe left in great spirit but also wondering if that\u2019s a normal thing to happen?

Idk whose cheerios I pissed in but I guess I did. \n\n-My kindergartner had her first day of school this week and the teacher didn\u2019t give her a lunch or refill of her water all day, then sent her outside for 20 minutes in the hottest state in the US in the wrong pick up line. My son found her pale, sweaty, shaky and crying outside. \n\n-I felt bad and took her to her favorite fast food joint to eat and get her favorite drink. They gave her rotten milk. I brought it back to exchange and it took 15 minutes of being ignored to get a new one and I didn\u2019t even get a sorry. \n\n-I booked a rental home for a weekend three weeks ago and the stay is tomorrow. The host canceled me this morning stating I had too many guests even through she approved it three weeks ago with me clearly stating how many would be there at that point. I\u2019m also a 5 star guest with several ratings. Either way, the site I booked on said \u201cthat sucks, here\u2019s a refund, good luck finding somewhere to stay in this popular city less than 24 hours out\u201d. I hate that the host had a strict cancellation policy where I\u2019d have been charged full price for cancelling even 3 weeks ago yet I just get my money back \/eventually\/ and am stuck scrambling and will ultimately either be forced into a more expensive home or have nowhere to stay. \n\n- I grabbed breakfast before a hair appointment this morning and got it to go so I wouldn\u2019t risk being late. Opened it up and it\u2019s missing half its ingredients. I sucked it up and ate it because my hair stylist should be coming out any minute now and it\u2019s a long appointment so I didn\u2019t want to starve myself and pass out (my blood sugar tanks super easy)\n\n-Guess what, I\u2019m her first appointment of the day and 30 minutes past my appointment go by.

I told her I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay and that I was worried but I\u2019m also like dang I moved two other appointments around to make this happen and I have a big event tomorrow so I rather not reschedule. She said she\u2019d be here in 30 minutes an hour ago and still not here. She has a strict cancellation and late policy where I\u2019d end up paying half of the estimated cost if I did this. \n\nI think I\u2019d be less upset about these two things if I knew I\u2019d be provided the same respect they demand with exuberant fees.

I went to a restaurant to get food for me and my parents. I walk in and they're getting a lot of calls and such, but they take my order and I hand them my card to swipe. They swiped and hand me the receipts, I sign and didn't really think about it but they didn't hand me back my card, I realized five minutes or so later and there's already some people in there so I let them finish and I tell one of the two workers that I didn't get my card back. He didn't say anything and pointed to back (where the lady who took my order was) and he goes back there she comes out and I tell her the sake thing. She insisted she gave me back my card I, tell her I don't have it and that I already checked where I was and myself, she continues to insist she gave it back without checking. Now I never screamed at them or did anything alarming towards them and I calmly ask them if they can check the counter where she was and the back because she went back there after taking my order, she refuses. So I let her know that I'll call the police to let them know the situation and see if they can help and do so. I wait, the policeman came and I explain to him the situation and that I just want them to check in the back atleast to see if they misplaced it and that I wasn't mad at them or anything since they was busy and you can misplace items while working. We both walk in and he asks if she has my card, she again said no, and we walk back out and he tells me there's nothing he can do and that he can file a missing item report. So I hand him my ID and ask if he can see if he can get them to check the back because I did see her leave to the back after swiping and asks me why would I want him to do that and I answer so that I'd atleast know that it's actually lost and I don't have to get a another card sent especially since I'm leaving in 2 days. He argues that he can't really do anything and he says that I can ask again so we both go back in and I ask again. She does the same thing, im getting frustrated and ask her if I can look back there myself since they obviously didn't look themselves she lets me behind the counter, I can't find it, so cool it's not behind the counter I ask again if they can check in the back because she did go back them almost immediately after swiping my card, they refuse, I ask the officer if he can do anything about it and  he argues a bit with me about what he can do, and proceeds to ask the lady if she wants a trespass order put on me, I tell them I just want to know if they have my card or not because they refused to look for it and that I leave really soon. In the end I ended up leaving them my info and description of the card. Fast forward to today, I call the police department to ask how I should go about getting the trespass thing lifted they explain it that the owners of the restaurant has to do it for me, so I call the restaurant I ask let them know who it was calling and ask if they could lift the tress pass order, they refused and basically kept saying they didn't have my card, I told them I'm that I'm handling my card situation and ask again if they can call the police department and lift the thing off me, this is all happening over the course of multiple calls because they kept hanging up, I called again and told them I literally just want it lifted. They tell me they're busy and they can't do it, I ask whenever they get and they continue to run around the question and insist they didn't have my card and hang up.

Having a moment on my own I decided I'm going to share this even though I'm a little bit ashamed about the whole thing. Since my gf supports me sharing this.... here we go.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI live in a nice city in the Netherlands. In my neighborhood is a retirement home, meaning that there are pretty much always a certain amount of elderly people within the nearby supermarkets. Mostly business as usual, and sometimes not. Years ago I noticed that while the cashier was ringing up my items the customer before me had left her groceries and just started to walk off!  I quickly ran after her to warn her and all went well but yeah...\n\n**Shopping with my gf**\n\nIt's Sunday, my girlfriend was staying at my place during the weekend and we decided that we'd get stupid and grab a few cans of beer and some snacks for the evening, to enjoy the last evening of the weekend.\n\nWe went to a local supermarket which also provides self scans. Even better: they also have hand scanners so you basically check out the items yourself and at the self checkout you pop in the scanner, scan your customer id card and you can pay. Easy. And useful too because if there are discounts and such you'll notice them immediately on the scanner. I especially enjoy this from time to time because I can do everything with my phone. My phone can easily display the barcode of my customer id card, and I can also make wireless payments with my phone.\n\nThe carts there have a nice holder at the handle bar so that you can easily take the scanner with you. I usually leave it in the handle and move the items I want to purchase within the vicinity of the laser to add them to my shopping list.\n\n***An annoying old lady***\n\nWe were standing near the cheese section, wondering if we'd get some snacks that go with the beer, when we suddenly hear the bleep of the handscanner. The sound was close enough for me to wonder if ours was malfunctioning or such but nope...\n\nAn old lady had actually walked up to our cart, scanned the item in her hand using our scanner and after she looked at the price she put the item in her basket and was turning her attention to other stuff. What the heck?\n\n\"*Excuse me madam, but...  please don't use our scanner*\", I tell her while getting ready to remove the last item.\n\n\"*But I needed to see the price of the item, sometimes they forget the discount*\", she tells me. \"*Maybe so, but you can use the scanners on the walls for that* (I point at one of the scanners a few meters away from us). *You shouldn't use other people's scanner, if we didn't know you scanned an item we might end up paying for an item without actually having it!*\".\n\nIt seemed she understood but...  sure enough, a few moments later: <bleep>. ffs... I turn around, same lady. This time she actually put the item which she had just scanned back on the shelf. Now, come on here...  \"*Madam, I just told you: don't do that... this isn't your scanner.*\".\n\nShe mumbled something and I decided enough is enough, so I kept the scanner in my hand.\n\nA few minutes later in an another isle we suddenly hear <bleep>, quickly followed by an annoyed voice: \"*What the heck do you think you're doing.... cut that out!!*\". We turn around to see and sure enough, here we go again... now she was using someone else's scanner.\n\n\"*But how am I supposed to see if the discount works? It's not fair!*\", the old woman retorts in a somewhat pouting voice.\n\nI'll be fully honest with you guys: I figured 'whatever', and got ready to move on.\n\nMy girlfriend though had other ideas and she figured... enough is enough. No, not in the way you might be thinking right now....\n\n# Want me to teach you?\n\nMy girlfriend walks up to the lady who was now pouting a bit and she asks why the woman doesn't get a scanner of her own? The woman tells her that she tried it a few times and everything went wrong. \"*And no one never wants to help me!*\", she says.\n\nSo... my gf asks the woman if she had a customer id card. When she doesn't fully understand gf \"borrows\" mine to show her and sure enough, she recognizes it: \"*I got a points card too, sure!*\".\n\nThen my gf tells her that this was all she needed to scan her own items. Of course you had to pay electronically with PIN, the woman told her that she always did that, so...my gf asked me to look after the womans basket for a moment and took her all around the store, past the tills, all the way back towards the entrance where my gf showed the woman how to unlock a scanner of your own.\n\nOnce back in the store they walk up to me and gf explains that the scanner is basically your digital shopping cart and the woman begins to scan all her items again.  My gf then grabs the cheese the woman tried to check earlier only to put it back and she used that to show her how you can remove an item from your scanner if you don't want it.\n\nI swear...  that womans face lit up and she got quite enthusiastic.\n\n\"*So if I scan something then I also buy it, later at the tills?*\" , that's right gf says: \"*but don't worry, I'll help you with that part too*\".\n\n\"*I need to write this down!*\", the woman goes and so the next moment we head over to the non food section where she grabs a paper notebook, scans it, grabs some pencils, scans them and then unpacks the items and she actually starts re-iterating all the things my gf told her, one step at a time, and she writes the whole thing down while asking my gf if she got all the steps right (which she did).\n\nWe only needed a few more items so we decided to split up for a moment and meet back at the tills. I quickly grabbed the last of our items and when I met up with them my gf had just finished explaining how the woman could pay her items.\n\nThat woman was very grateful. Hardly the annoying entitled Karen I'd consider her at first, but more so a confused lady who merely needed a little help.\n\nShe made 2 photocopies of her notes, then gave my gf some candybars for helping her out so well!\n\nWe said our goodbyes and that was the end of our encounter.\n\n***Just some back story...***\n\nMy gf is very respectful towards the elderly, it's basically something she grew up with. So when she had concluded that it wasn't necessarily malice but pure honest confusion that bothered the lady she decided to resolve this in her own way.\n\nAnd...  now, don't pick up my story in the wrong way here. But this situation definitely made me realize that we have a bit of an issue in our modern Western society at times. And before you ask: I myself am just as big a part of that problem, let's not kid ourselves.\n\nWhen I do my shopping alone one of the first things I do is put in my earbuds and from there on I'm somewhat in my own world. Without having much attention to situations such as this one....  would I have done what my gf did if I was on my own? It shames me a little to say this, but I doubt it.\n\nAnd that's a bit of a problem I think.\n\nThanks for reading...  this is a story that has been on my mind ever since I started sharing some on Reddit and well...  I felt like I had to share this one too. Not only all the good stuff.\n\n\\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nTL;DR?  (I don't mind)\n\n* I'm shopping with my gf and decide to use self scan (the hand scanner).\n* While deciding on an item we hear \"bleep\" behind us: an old lady used our scanner to check an item.\n* I tell her off, a few moments later she does the same thing with someone else's scanner, who also tells her off.\n* gf decides to take matters in her own hands and she asks the woman why she doesn't get her own scanner?\n* When the woman tells her that she doesn't know how gf decides to show her exactly how it works.\n* gf takes the woman all the way back to the entrance of the store, shows her how to unlock the scanner, how to scan and remove items and later on also shows her how to pay for her items.\n* Woman gets excited, buys herself a notebook and some pencils and writes the whole thing down; one step at a time.\n* In the end the woman turned out to be very grateful, she even gave my gf some candybars for all her help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Small update**\n\nThank you guys **so much** for all your nice & warm reactions! I sent the link to my gf (obviously) so she can read it too, also because she doesn't have a Reddit account (yet?) and yeah; she definitely appreciated the nice comments as well.\n\nAs for the name of the shop and such... sorry. Not going to share. Not only because of rule #1 in this channel (\"Keep things anonymous\") but also because I don't want to share too much personal details. The store is a bit regional so to speak.\n\nThanks again, really happy to see most of you fellow Redditors could enjoy this!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1659483587.0},{"title":"Trying to buy a new boat in South Florida.","author":"Javigpdotcom","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/wdp9jt\/trying_to_buy_a_new_boat_in_south_florida\/","text":"Last February I attended the Miami Boat Show with the intention of buying a Boat as a birthday present to my self. My birthday is in July so I was confident that I was doing it with enough time in advance.\n\nI ended up at this dealership booth and told me I cannot buy a boat directly from _______, just from a dealership and they had two boats of the model I wanted coming. One was going to arrive at the end of May and one in June. I wanted to pay for it on the spot there, but they told me they couldn\u2019t tell me the final price for it. Which sounded very suspicious.\nAnyway, I ended up making a deposit for the boat that was supposed to arrive in May. The first one, independently of the color of the boat. That they also couldn\u2019t tell me which one it was. Very suspicious too.\n\nBy May I reached out to the dealership and they didn\u2019t know when the boat was going to arrive. I kept calling them during all June and July. My birthday passed and they still didn\u2019t know anything about when the boat was arriving or if it was arriving at all. Absolute no communication with me, I was the one chasing the dealership at every point and their only answer was \u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d\n\nLast week, I called again and first they told me their usual \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d but when I insisted, they suddenly realized that \u201cthe boat was not in the system anymore\u201d that Yamaha had canceled it. According to them. The entire thing sounded so suspicious, so I called a different dealership to understand how is that possible.\n\nThe other dealership explained a lot of the shady practices that the first dealership does. From selling boat they received that were reserved for a client to a different highest bidder, charging additional fees (that\u2019s why they wouldn\u2019t tell me the price upfront), and many more things.\n\nHow does ______ allow that?\nHow is it possible that I\u2019ve been waiting since February and there\u2019s absolutely not officially answer to my request for a boat? \nHow does anyone can trust buying anything from ________ that way?\n\nThis been the biggest disappointment for me because I\u2019ve always saw _______ as a respectable brand. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to be able to trust any of your products_ ever again. If I have so many problems trying to buy something new, what would it happen if I buy it and something breaks or goes wrong?\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t understand how can they do business like that, feels like they don\u2019t care about disappointing costumers.

And they basically told me that is the way they work.\n\nThat the dealer can change the prices, they can lie to you and do whatever they want, because _________ only does business to business. So basically the consumer has absolutely no options.\n\nThey were completely unapologetic about it.\nI\u2019m seriously in shock, I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in any kind of business.\n\nHow terrible is that? \nHas anyone had a similar experience with boat manufacturers?","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1659380057.0},{"title":"Did we receive bad service?","author":"hnnhwrnr01","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/wddvba\/did_we_receive_bad_service\/","text":"I just posted in r\/ask to find out if there was a better sub to post in, I\u2019m going to post here in the meantime.\n\nWe are in the UK by the way.\n\nMy family and I went out for dinner on Friday night for my 21st birthday, we had booked a table for 8 people at 6:30PM. We arrived on time and were sat straight away (the waitress did seem a bit standoffish but we soon saw her leaving her shift so I figured she was just tired at the end of work).

We had been seated for over two hours before we received our mains. We had ordered our starters and mains at the same time. \n\nMy main question is, is my family overreacting? They seemed a lot more upset about it than I was, my dad even loudly asked the waitress to remove any kind of tip (I hate complaining and things like that so at this point I just wanted the ground to swallow me up).\n\nMy parents said they were mad because no one came to apologise for the wait or ask us how the food had been - to be honest I don\u2019t think our waitress cracked a smile even once or made us feel welcome.

I'm over 1\/4 native American, but you wouldn't know by looking at me. Despite not 'looking' mixed, my hair is much thicker and stronger than expected. \n\nThe first time i ever got my hair bleached, the stylist was wonderful. She was definitely out of my budget for regular appointments, but gave me the formula she used on my hair so i could find someone more affordable.\n\nThe next time i got a bleach touch up was almost a year later. I went to a student salon since it's what i could afford. After the student was done asking some background questions she told me her plan to bleach my hair. The following is how that conversation went:\n\nStudent: so, I'm thinking we use -bleach powder brand- and 20 volume developer.\n\nMe: I'm not sure about using 20, the last stylist that bleached my hair used 30 and i really liked the results. I know my hair doesn't look it, but it's quite thick and coarse.\n\nStudent: let me go grab an instructor and see what they think\n\nMe: -explains to instructor I'm mixed and the last stylist used 30-\n\nInstructor: -playing with my hair- yeah, go ahead and use 20\n\nMe: you're the professional!\n\nI let them apply the bleach and foil me up, then i sat under the heat lamp. After 30 mins my scalp started getting really irritated, but my hair wasn't done lifting so i tried to tough it out. After an HOUR i finally couldn't tolerate the burning anymore and asked to be rinsed.\n\nMy hair was destroyed. The entire section she bleached (an undercut section) was patchy, brassy, orange, dry and absolutely FRIED. internally i was fuming as the stylist applied the color which was supposed to be blue and purple, but ended up looking green and brownish purple. My hair was so damaged it destroyed my curl pattern and my hair was frequently breaking mid shaft. It also lightly burned my scalp as well and i had one or two small blisters from the bleach sitting for so long.\n\nSince then i have not received any kind of chemical service from a salon. Instead i did a lot of googling, video watching, question asking and testing to figure out how to bleach my own hair. This all happened in mid 2020 and i finally have shoulder length hair after chopping off the damaged portion.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1659307898.0},{"title":"Stayed at a hotel with dirty unchanged linens and mouse poop in the bed.

We took our first 2 bowls on my turn and the machine didn\u2019t read any of the shots. We informed the reception desk to a different staff member to who served us originally which held the body language and facial expression of a married woman of several seeing their Husband come home from\nThe piss:- Not impressed and slightly dead on the inside. Without saying a word she came around the till and started walking towards the Bowling Lanes without knowing which lane we were on. I of course followed her. I told her which lane we were on after she finally decided to speak to me and she continued to our lane to press the reset button. She watched me take my first bowl and order finally resumed\u2026 Or so we thought.\n\nAfter taking a turn each we encountered further problems. The machine wasn\u2019t reading our scores again, however was resetting the pins with the same amount pins we were hitting down. Though the thought of being babied in to spares were novel, it wasn\u2019t making for a competitive or thrilling game. At this point our inner Karen was starting to develop and my Girlfriend decided to take one for the team this time and complained to the same staff member who reset our lane the first time. We were informed that we must have been on a \u201ckids game\u201d baring in mind I have the gut of a 40 year old and the chin of a Billy-Goat I couldn\u2019t think of any conclusion of us being on a kids game. \n\nWe decided to keep playing as we didn\u2019t want to bother the staff and just put up with our scores not being recorded properly, until I scored a spare and the game froze completely and didn\u2019t reset the pins. The inner Karen in me was now in full effect. I went back to kindly complain to who was a very understanding staff member different from before. He swapped our lanes, reported the broken lane immediately and gave me a sincere apology. \n\nI went back to our new lane:- Lane 4 to what I believed would be the end of our horror story. Alas this story is yet to finish. \n\nWe started bowling our games but when the bowling pins were being reset, there were constantly pins already dropped which meant pins would be on the floor and not giving a true representation of our bowling skills. I\u2019m no 10-pin-king but it was becoming a joke at this stage. We pressed reset like the first staff member showed us before but all this meant is that pins were disappearing leaving 9 to 7 pins left to bowl before even taking a turn. At this point we decided to deal with it and thus this review came in to existence. \n\nTo put the cherry on the cake we had little kids running in on front of our lane and winding up other older kids. I don\u2019t blame the business for this but it was making me believe I was a fever dream. \n\nUltimately, all joking aside I\u2019m disappointed we had to contact members of staff 3 times, be moved to another lane and still encounter problems.

This is a long one.\n\nGoing to set up some backstory here. We're a house of three, and as part of her rent payment, one of the roommates here pays for the cable\/internet bill. We previously had an incident when we moved ten years ago and $ISP demanded we return our equipment and they reissued us new equipment, all of which had issues right out the gate and they proceeded to lead us on for weeks making us think it was our fault. It ended in me (who was, and still is not on the roommate's account) blowing up at $ISP on social media, and they finally sent out a senior tech who knew what the problem was and replaced our faulty equipment with working stuff.\n\nHaven't had an issue since.\n\nUntil now, of course. Now being a couple months ago, at least when this started.\n\nAs part of routine contract negotiations, we call in and see if we can wheel and deal a bit. We get on a better package that comes with gigabit internet for the same price we're already paying! Cool beans. I'm the heavy internet user in the house, this should be cool as frig. Short of a small hiccup (they put us on the new plan but the plan wasn't \"applied\") things were going swimmingly.\n\nUntil I noticed that on a consistent basis every night (7-9pm) the internet would start sputtering, bad. Tried everything we could think of. Once again blaming the equipment, I opted to just go out and buy a new modem (seeing as ours couldn't even take advantage of the faster speeds, anyway) and that works. For a little bit, at least. Placebo, I guess. Problems came back in a week. Fast forward to this month (July).\n\nSeeing as both the girlfriend and roommate are not technical, and seeing as the last time I did this it resulted in great success, I opt to hail $ISP on social media again, asking assistance. Very responsive, things are looking up! They confirm that yes, there's an issue, they're aware things have been going awry as of late as our neighbors have reported similar issues, and they're performing upgrades and fixing damaged lines. No ETA, but check back in a week and see where we're at.\n\n*Two weeks later...*\n\nThings still aren't looking good, so I reach back out to them in the very same DM thread, and say hey, just following up as my internet is still pining for the fjords most nights. They run tests and say there's a *ton* of noise on the line, but they're also still working on things, so to check back again in a week or so. The rep said they'd look at giving the account a bill credit for the trouble.\n\nAnd that was that for now. Or so I thought.\n\nMidnight rolls around (I'm a night owl) and everything cuts. TVs, internet, *everything*. At first, I think nothing of it, assuming they're probably working on things or there's an outage. I fire up $GameLauncher in offline mode and play some games for an hour or so.\n\nI notice things are still REALLY down. Figure I'd see if there's an actual outage going on. I pull up the $ISP app and login. No can do, it kicks me back out. What the...\n\nI remember that $ISP has two apps, maybe the newer one works? I try to log in multiple times (cellular here is spotty) finally getting in and it says two things: \"Your bill is past due\" and \"You no longer have $ISP service\". Huh? We've been living together for ten years. And the roommate has only failed to pay *ONCE* and that was when she lost her job and was really not doing so great. Maybe autopay derp'd or something. Figured I'd just poke her about it when she wakes up. Go back to doing offline things.\n\nSomething still bothered me, though: \"You no longer have $ISP service\". That seems...rather harsh for a bill that's merely past due. I decide I want to look into this more because something ain't right. I look at the bill history (because while I'm not authorized and such, I do still have the login for the account). Due to local taxes and such, the amount is different every month, and I noticed the past due amount matches perfectly with next month's bill, which isn't due...until the 8th. Wait, what?\n\nI pull the actual \"paper\" bills (and by that I mean the PDFs on our account) and yep, there it is, July's bill was deducted perfectly, zero balance going into August. Something got messed up *good*, and I guessed that $ISP's billing system got messed up somehow. I gave it a little bit longer, but nothing was resolving.\n\nI check the account history logs. Nothing of value there. I finally put two and two together and decide to check the ISP-provided email inbox, seeing as we never use it (because we all have our own external emails). Maybe any alerts if raised would go there, even though we have our external emails listed as contacts for account things?\n\nSure enough, there it was: **Your cancellation request has been received and your last day of service is 7\/24.**\n\nCue panic. Because if anyone in the house was going to do this all of us would damn well know, so I highly doubt our roommate would just rugpull us like this. My fears were confirmed when I looked at the timestamp on the email: 7\/24, at 10:30pm. AKA the exact time I was talking in DMs with $ISP's social media support. Somehow they were able to pull up the account and hit the \"send account to shadow realm\" button, even though I never once actually authenticated nor approved any changes.\n\nI DM their social media support again. \"Hey uh, I think you guys may have accidentally canceled our account, because we got a cancellation email and that was NOT what I was trying to do!\"\n\nNo response. I know it's like, 2am at this point, but their account says \"24\/7 support\".\n\nI try another social media network. I get damn near an instant response. I give the account name, address, everything relevant. They see what happened, but can't discuss what happened with me because, well, I'm not my roommate, and she would need to reach out. Because account security. Hoooo boy, I'm so dead. As I'm trying to plead with them to just...put the account as it was before all this happened and that I don't care to hear much of anything about account matters, the roommate wakes up and she is on the *warpath*.\n\nI'm trying to get her caught up on everything and she--justifiably--is enraged. She tries to call into customer care, but they're telling her that this is all my fault (I mean, it kind of is) and that $ISP doesn't have a social media department (except yeah, they do) and that I should have never went to social media for this, we should have called them and it was my fault for messing everything up. Worse yet, they claimed the only people who could help us was sales, and they didn't open until way after my roommate had to be at work. To say she about wanted to end me right then and there...yeah. Seriously, running for my life at that point seemed like a good option.\n\n\"Give me your phone.\" She says, and begins going off on the poor rep that was on the other social media thing that was actually responsive, giving them the lowdown about what happened on the phone and she wanted this resolved *RIGHT NOW.* (I did send an apology for her kinda flying off the handle afterwards, I know those peeps weren't the ones who did this.)\n\nThankfully, some light shined at the end of the proverbial tunnel, as the rep from the first DM thread (that went unresponsive earlier) came back online and apologized profusely because she saw *everything* go down (and reviewed the call where the rep lied about everything). She said she can have the account back in minutes, but I'd need the roommate's phone to approve it. YES PLEASE. SEND IT. SEND IT NOW. FREE ME FROM THIS HELL\n\nGot the message on the roommate's phone to clear everything (okay, why the hell didn't she have to approve the account cancellation? What the hell?) and short of a few speed bumps along the way, the damage was reversed (and a TON of bill credits were issued for this mess).\n\nAs a bit of a fun bit post-story, even the $ISP employees I spoke to have no idea how this happened. They said normally the contact info on file (which has our email addresses) should get an alert, but...I checked everything. Spam folders, etc. Nothing. No alert was sent outside of the ISP webmail that is never checked. Time to set up forwarding for that, I guess.\n\nI also made sure to set myself as one of the account managers so god forbid a screwup like this ever occurs again (and I hope it won't) I actually have the means to fix it. Lesson learned the hard way, I guess. Hopefully you enjoyed reading this long-ass bit that kept me up all night trying to frantically fix it before all hell broke loose.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1658816895.0},{"title":"I am TIRED of Nail Salons","author":"sayitaintsogeorge","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/w70676\/i_am_tired_of_nail_salons\/","text":"99% of nail salons I have gone to have left me feeling unhappy.

We ordered, receive our drinks and eventually our food comes. I had a patty melt which comes already cut in half. It was not fully cooked and still a little bloody, also very visible without any sort of rearrangement. I am not confrontational and I don't think I've ever sent something back at a restaurant in my life, I just suck it up and deal if the order is messed up. However, I know that ground beef needs to be fully cooked or it can make you sick. \n I notice as my plate is put in front of me and immediately comment to the waitress and have it sent back to finish cooking. It was a polite exchange and not a big deal. My mom says she'll eat slowly so we don't have a gap in our meals. We wait over 30 minutes at this point and they were using the same patty I was sent, as I had not yet touched my plate and the waitress asked if that was ok. So it really shouldn't have taken this long on a slow day. My mom finishes her meal and I waive down our waitress, apologize, and politely ask to have my meal removed from our ticket so we can pay. We had plans so I couldn't take it to go. The waitress was PISSED about it?! But I still paid for my moms meal\/ drink, my drink and left a good tip, $10 on a $12 something ticket. \n\nOn to the story:\n My mom, daughter (7) and myself are having a day out. My mom decides she wants to go back, I decline  and we try to compromise. I start feeling guilty because I know she really wants to eat there and my kiddo loves their party pancakes from the kids menu. I decide f it, let's give it another try and head over there. \n We get there, walk in ( it's extremely slow) and immediately I see our waitress from last time standing in the waitstaff section. The host greets us and let's the waitress know that we'll be in her section. She protests and tells the host we were AH's  the last time we were there. I could clearly hear her but my mom hadn't because her hearing is not great. I am super pissed but let it go so I don't spoil our day. \n We're seated and greeted by the waitress and our exchange towards each other is polite and friendly. Drink and food orders were taken. My mom gets pancakes and kiddo gets party kid menu pancakes. I order patty melt again and ask to change the potato bread for a bun or regular bread.\n We get our drinks, mom and kiddo's are correct. I order sweet teat, get unsweet with (literally) 3 ice cubes. W\/ ever don't complain, just drink it. We get our food and my mom gets her food and her order is correct and looks great. My kiddo gets hers and her poor little pancakes are pretty crispy, almost burnt and did not have the special party icing stuff on top. Again, w\/e I don't complain because she's dousing it in syrup and doesn't seem to mind.\n My food comes out 15 minutes later and my patty melt had the potato bread and is so freaking hard I can barely bite through but silently suck it up.\n In all of this time, no refills or checking on us. Still no complaints though, I just wanna get it over with. We finished and get the bill. They charge an extra $2 for my kids side?! I check her menu again and there is clearly no extra expense for her choice in sides and is included with her meal. We didn't get anything extra or even a Togo cup. \n Alrighty then! I insisted to my mom that I pay and tip. She already knew I was not happy but I hadn't said anything and tried to sit quietly and not ruin the mood so she didn't know why until we left and i told her. I go up to the register to pay and when the screen asks about tip I make sure to NOT LEAVE A CENT! I will definitely not be going back.

We knew the food was good and the staff friendly.\n\nWe called in advance to book a table for 8:30PM. However, when we arrived the patio was completely full. Not one free table in sight. We announced ourselves to the staff who then called the owner. He then explains that the staff member who took our booking forgot to put it in the system. He apologized profusely and asked us to wait inside the restaurant (which was empty) until a table freed itself. We asked if we could just eat inside but the owner said no one was covering this area and it would not be possible. So, my family and I just sat inside waiting for someone to leave their table. While we were waiting, we could witness how much of a fiasco this night was going to be. Two staff members (must have been new to the restaurant) kept making mistakes (not taking the right orders, taking care of tables that were not their own meaning some orders were put in twice in the systems\u2026). We waited 45 minutes before I asked them if it would be possible to order some drinks to make the wait more pleasurable. When our drinks arrived, the virgins were not in fact virgin so we had to ask for new ones. \n\nWe ended up waiting for almost an hour and a half before having a table. Our waitress we guessed was one of the new ones because she was totally out of touch. She had to come back two times to make sure she had our order correct (and it was not). We wanted to order another round of drink so we waived at her so she could come\u2026 I kid you not, she WAVED BACK AT US, SMILED AND LEFT!!! We were dumbfounded but we did laugh a lot about the whole situation.\nWe had ordered two sets of fajitas (they are basically DIY fajitas were they bring you a variety of ingredients and you make them yourself which is super fun!!) but didn\u2019t received the tortilla\/bread part of the fajitas so we had to eat the ingredients separately..\n\nWhile we ate, we watched our waitress break countless glasses, steal a paper plane from a kid and manage to get her hand almost bitten off by a dog. By the end of our dinner, the owner sat at our tables and talked to us, apologizing for this evening. In fact, the evening was so bad it became legendary. We laughed a lot even if sometimes it was at the expense of the waitress. \nWe told the owners we understood the struggles of finding staff after this covid era, specifically in this very touristic region. We tried to cheer him up but we had to tell him how awful the waitress had been, even for a newbie. That\u2019s when we learned that this woman was in her 40s and had been a waitress for half of her life (not in this particular restaurant though). I can\u2019t understand how after 20 years of experience you can still treat people like this. \n\nWe thought the owner would offer us the first round of drinks, or even a small reduction for our patience or how we had been treated but that was not the case. We did not tip (appreciated but not obligatory in our country) and even if we laughed a lot (albeit out of frustration) and had fun we will not come back. \n\nSo yeah, that was the worst experience I had in a restaurant. I tried my damn best not to be judgmental (or a Karen!!!) and as nice as possible but it was very hard sometimes!!","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1657897598.0},{"title":"College kids are wild \ud83d\ude02","author":"ladyreyreigns","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/vzdy1z\/college_kids_are_wild\/","text":"(Posted earlier today but got taken down for using the name.)\n\nI\u2019m trying so hard not to laugh right now.

My husband a Schnitzel and I my Rumpsteak, english of course.\n\nThe dishes came, and lo and behold, my steak was barely still medium but almost well done.\n\nSo I sent it back.

She said the new cook wouldn't serve rare steaks since people always demanded them to be cooked more and he'd just not do it anymore.\n\nI asked her if he said 'people' or women and she blushed more.

We told her to take it back, paid for our drinks but not the food, gave her a tip and left.\n\nWe wrote a mail later and got an apology from the owner. A look at the ratings showed, we weren't the only people who had complained. \n\nA few weeks later we got an email that announced that they were happy to welcome their new cook. Went back once and everything was fine again. But in between we'd frequented another restaurant that was just so much better so we stopped being regulars there. \n\nThe town is a tourist town and they were doing well for a while.

I was 20 years old at the time, and after work I would stop at a nearby convenience store\/gas station to buy a drink and play coin-op arcade games. This particular convenience store would rotate their games on a fairly regular basis to keep things from getting stale and I would spend a few bucks each night winding down. On this occasion I brought my younger brother so we could try to beat a side-scrolling shooter. I had a $20.00, which I exchanged for a $10.00 bill, a $5.00 bill, and $5.00 worth of quarters.\n\nWe made it about halfway through the game on the first $5.00 worth of quarters when we ran out. While my brother kept the game going, I went to the counter to get more change. The guy working the register gave me the change, but made sure I understood how much of a hassle it was for him to open the register and count out the coins. I took the quarters and went back to the game.\n\nWe made it almost to the end of the game when I had to run and get more change. When I got to the register and asked him for more, he crossed his arms and said loudly \"WE ARE NOT A BANK.\" Now, at this particular chain of stores, there used to be a machine behind the register that they could push a single button and a roll of whatever version of change you needed would drop out. I was prepared to give him the $10.00 and take a full roll to keep him from having to count, but after making that declaration, he walked into the back office and didn't come out again--without giving me change. No one else was working, so there was no one else to ask. I went back to the game, and my brother lost to the final boss, which was just icing on the cake. I was furious.\n\nWhen I got home, I looked up the store number in the Yellow Pages, then called the corporate office. After navigating through their phone system I reached the complaint department, and a woman answered. I told her my tale of woe, and mentioned that if they didn't want people to play video games at their store, perhaps they should remove them altogether. But if they wanted the machines there, then they needed to give us change when we ask for it. The woman replied, \"sweetie, you can have as much change as you want, anytime you want.\" I said, \"then please tell them that.\"\n\nThe next day I went back to the store, but a different employee was working that shift. When she saw me she asked, \"Did you call Corporate to complain about not being given change for the video games?\" I said \"yes, I did.\" She replied, \"Good for you! There's an angry letter stapled to our bulletin board in the office telling us that we are required to give people change whenever they ask.\"\n\nI continued going to that store for years afterward, but I never saw that guy again. Still, I've never forgotten him. To this day I wonder what his problem was, and why he decided to be such a dick about something that made their store money.\n\nAnd because I know someone will ask, \"no, we never beat the game.\" The employee ruined the moment, and we weren't about to spend another $10.00 on it.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1657304817.0},{"title":"Just the language barrier","author":"Enerla","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/vudc9y\/just_the_language_barrier\/","text":"It happened in last December, but some ads from the company involved made me remember this. I live in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. To keep the background short: It is a nice historical European city, with many videos filmed by Youtubers showing how beautiful is. But certainly, it isn't suburbia, and you would find so many options for transit everywhere, that even some \"pizza boys\" decide that they don't want to use a moped or a bicycle if they can deliver the food using bus, tram, and walking. \n\nWe don't have the same big food delivery apps as people in the USA but we have one with a pink and turquoise logo, one with a green logo (tied to a taxi company) and one with a blue logo. Delivery drivers at all 3 can make above average wages if they are okay with long working hours. When we order online, we also decide on the tip, and we can't increase it for good service and can't reduce it for horrible service.\n\nTheir app claimed that I have some credit in their store that would expire soon. So, I had to order something. Too bad that their push notification didn't mention that the credit cannot be used for their main hot food delivery. \"If you would go to your profile, then you search for it there...\" It was disappointment number 1, but it was unimportant for the story. \n\nI have ordered some burgers, fries, shake, red bull, etc. from a fast-food chain, I would rarely visit, but if they advertise some seasonal offer I might like, I tend try some offers. Their place is at the nearby transit hub, which is 5 mins walking distance away, or 3 mins if I would use the bus or tram. Of course, the delivery comes later than predicted by their app. It was a bit slow. \n\nBut at least I don't have to leave the warmth of my place in the cold, in the middle of the pandemic, waiting a bit more can be okay. Waiting a lot more can turn people to hangry as well. The app tracks the delivery on the map, but with some break it would arrive, *if* the driver would be able to read the address, as he keeps trying to go in the wrong door to wrong stairwell, simply because he doesn't speak the language, and can't even reach the address. \n\nTime to go out, search for him, but as he was unable to find my door, I had to prove that I have ordered the food. While their boxes had some built-in separators to separate cold beverages from hot food, he neglected that, and with his break enroute and how he was unable to find an address easily found by ***all other delivery drivers*** the food was cold. \n\nOf course, when I had to prove I have ordered the (already paid for) food, one problem became obvious. He didn't speak the language. That is why he had a tough time understanding some instructions, and the part of the address about the staircase. \n\nAnd the instructions about how to do his job, how to separate hot stuff from the cold stuff? Normally, as we live in Hungary, most instructions should be in Hungarian. Language barriers can be natural as our language is hard to learn. As locals we cannot be expected to know Arabic, German, Serbian, Russian, Chinese, French, English and a lot of other languages right?\n\nBut when a delivery driver can't understand some part of address, some instructions simply because he don't speak the language... He cannot ask for help from Dispatch or their customer service staff. When he forgot to ask for help in the restaurant. When he can't find out that he has Google Translate and other translator tools, and that is why interpreting the address and instructions that worked for hundreds or perhaps thousands of delivery drivers before are impossible for him, then we have a problem. \n\nWe have a language barrier not because he doesn't speak the language. Even if in a customer facing job targeting locals it is better if you would speak the local language. The problem is: If you can't even use Google Translate, that is a problem. \n\nI am sure that by being slow, that delivery driver missed a lot of bonuses, he also picked up less deliveries, so he made far less money than others.

We flag the server, shes rightfully pissed at the kitchen and shocked it made it to the table like that as the executive chef was supposedly cooking. Since the chicken was going back I requested my steak be remade the right temp as well. Server brought both dishes to the manager, manager was apologetic and offered a gift card. We said thank you, not necessary but appreciated and laughed it off. \n\nA different manager runs the remade food back to us and I see its the EXACT same steak\/salad that was sent back.

I see the exact same mammoth tomato on this salad and check the steak, sure enough, all well done except for a little bit of pink at the very end.

She has the gaul to chastise me and say \u201cwell do you at least want to cut into one of pieces to check\u201d \n\nIts a pre-sliced steak. The chef sliced it. \n\nI tell her this, and she defends the chef saying you never can tell the temp, so I finally snapped and asked if she would like to invite the exec chef out to tell me to my face what temperature this steak is. She says thats not necessary, your foods on us, and brings a gift card. \n\nThe whole time our server is beside herself. I assured her she was fabulous and did absolutely nothing wrong.

If you don\u2019t know, a co-op is essentially a store owned and run by its members rather than having a \u2018traditional\u2019 set of owners. The workers own the place they work, care more about its success, and get paid more, at least in theory. The co-op in this story was different in that most of its members were college students from the nearby university. The co-op offered a deal: if you become a member, you get a discount on everything in the store, and all you have to do is work there for 2 hours each week.\n\n\n\nAt the time, my girlfriend and I were trying to broaden our food horizons and try out new things. This included plant milks. We\u2019d tried soy, oat, hemp, rice, and a few others I\u2019ve forgotten about, but we hadn\u2019t yet had coconut milk (not the canned kind you use for cooking\/baking but the refrigerated kind that comes in a carton). This was just because we had trouble finding it. We later learned that this co-op carried it, so one day, we hopped on our bikes (no car at the time) and made the 30-ish minute ride to the store. We found 2 cartons of coconut milk, paid for them and some other groceries, and biked back home with our grocery bags hanging from our handlebars.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I take a carton out of the fridge, pull off the plastic tab seal, serve myself a cup, take a swig, and immediately spit it out in the sink. I check the date. It\u2019d expired 1 month ago. We check the other carton. Also expired 1 month ago. We decided to return them.\n\n\n\nA day or two later, we get back on our bikes, make the journey again with the milks and receipt, get to the store, explain to the cashiers what happened, get a refund and an apology, watch them set the cartons aside, and then bike back home. We chalk this up to a simple mistake.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now 3-4 weeks later. We decide to go back to the store to see if they have that milk now, preferably unexpired. We hop on our bikes, make the trip, and find 2 cartons of milk. Knowing better this time, I check the date. They\u2019re both expired. Bummer. But wait, that date looks familiar. I unscrew the lid from both. One of them still has the plastic tab seal, the other doesn\u2019t. So... these are the same cartons we had returned. The workers had put them back in the fridge instead of throwing them out.\n\n\n\nKind of pissed at the dangerous incompetence (although clearly it seems no else one was interested in buying this), we point out the mistake to the cashiers. We get the equivalent of a \u201cwhoops\u201d and they set the milks aside to be thrown out.\n\n\n\nBut before we leave the counter, one of them goes \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wondered what this tastes like,\u201d pops the plastic tab off of the unopened carton, and takes a swig from 2-months expired coconut milk that had been sitting out on a counter for who knows long. All I could do was watch, too shocked to stop her. Predictably, she made a disgusted face and ran off to presumably spit it out.\n\n\n\n???\n\n\n\nAnyway, we stopped going to that store after that, although we did see that 2 or 3 years later they had opened a restaurant attached to their store. The restaurant and store both eventually failed and now the co-op is no more. Looking back, we should have reported what happened, but at least they can't harm anyone anymore.\n\n\n\nI like co-ops, but maybe having the majority of the workers be untrained college kids doing their minimum 2 hours a week was a poor strategy.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1656949100.0},{"title":"one CSR helps the attractive woman next to me, the other tells me their desk is closed","author":"MacReady67","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/vr22ab\/one_csr_helps_the_attractive_woman_next_to_me_the\/","text":"Many years ago, I (m29) would fly between two cities each weekend for work and school.

Only 4 did not open up and has remained locked. I got my assumptions on this but one way or another, the packaged was stolen.

Then they filed a complaint agents the delivery company that will get escalated due to a package that was in their care being thieved. I also received a refund on another package I ordered at the same time due to receiving it damaged.

I always wanted to dye my hair and she knew about it, so I was very excited for that. Both of us were too scared to bleach it at home (which btw she's right) because that's a REALLY dangerous thing to do at home and can damage your hair if not done correctly.\n\nSo we decided it would be better to bleach my hair at the hair salon and then we would apply the hair dye at home since it is an easy thing to do. We spent the last week testing the colors on blonde hair strands I still had.\n\nContext: I wanted mint, pastel hair, and we used Manic Panic dye for it since it's \"safer\". They didn't have the pastel colors I wanted at the local store so we had to improvise with the hair dye and pastelizer, and tested out some colors until it came out how I wanted.\n\nAnyways, today I went to the hair salon. My mom explained the whole thing to the hairdresser like a week before, they're relatives and my mom has known everyone there for years so they're pretty intimate. I was there alone, so I explained again what I wanted to just remind them.\n\nThey bleached my hair just like I asked and I was happy that I was going to finally get the hair color I wanted since my twelves, but I started wondering why it was taking so long since they said the whole process would take like 2-3 hours and it was taking way longer than that. They were putting too much products on my hair, which I found weird since I was only going to bleach it. I used the phone screen and camera as a mirror to see what they were putting there. (Note: I was in a chair in a corner where I couldn't see myself in the mirror, I didn't know what they were putting in my hair) I thought it was some weird looking color shampoo, but I only realised it was blue hair dye when they started washing it and the blue thing wouldn't come out.\n\nI noticed my hair was blue\/turquoise. A really strong one.\n\nI immediately asked what they were doing and reminded them that I only wanted to bleach my hair. She didn't seem so shocked, she just said something like \"Oh, what a shame. Just wash it a few days and it will come off.\" I started texting my mom saying they were doing everything wrong, and asked if she specified that I wasn't going to dye my hair there. They were all laughing about their silly misunderstanding and I felt really bad about it.\n\nI looked at myself at the mirror and my hair was horrible since the color was too bright, and it was a shade that I didn't even ask for. They didn't even warned me about it or asked me to choose a shade of blue, they just put whatever they wanted.\n\nEventually my mom entered the hair salon while they were drying my hair since I was texting her during the whole process. The more I looked at me, the more I hated the hair color I didn't even ask for. The woman kept explaining my mom that it was a complete misunderstood, and that I, in fact, asked to only bleach my hair and not to dye it, but she completely forgot about it. Her and everyone at the hair salon. She said the dye would come off, but I could only wash my hair after 2 days.\n\nI still find it funny how she even charged for a hair dye she personally bought for that. A hair dye I didn't even ask for.\n\nWe went to the car after we finished and I cried it all out. I arrived at home still crying, I felt like my day was ruined after that. My mom was pissed, so was my dad that started screaming about how the hairdresser was a jerk for doing that to me. Knowing him, he would definitely go to the hair salon personally and scream at the hairdresser for doing a terrible job, but he didn't. Even though I hated the color they kept comforting me and saying it was still very beautiful.\n\nMy mom kind of already knew something was going to go wrong there. That hairdresser has a bad reputation because she never listens and does it her own way, so you have to explain precisely what you want. She once cutted my younger sister's hair in a way she didn't want and she spent 10 minutes in the bathroom crying because of that. Mom told me that she explained PRECISELY what I wanted, several times during the week, and still she got it all wrong.\n\nSumming up: My hair is now in a really bright and horrible color that I hate with all my being and I'm ashamed to leave home and be mocked by the rest of my family. I can't leave for 2-3 days because of that and it's my birthday, we were planning to go buy my birthday gift and just hang out. We all decided we would never come back to that hair salon again and I still feel really humilliated about it. To worsen, the day in general it's being really bad, and I could say this is the worse birthday I've ever had.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\[UPDATE!\\]**\n\nThank you everyone for all the advices! It's been weeks since I posted this and honestly I never thought it would get that much of attention. I ended up waiting the 2 days when everyone told me not to do it. But my aunt, a hairdresser too, (she's a nice one I swear!) advised me to also wait for it, and that out of all colors blue is the one that comes off easily and I shouldn't worry about it\n\nI did it, and after 48 hours I washed my hair. With hot water and a lot of dandruff shampoo. I expected the color not to come off, but as soon as I started massaging it the shampoo foam was in a bright ass, saturated blue, so was the water when I washed it off. Honestly I was pretty scared and surprised, I wasn't expecting that much of dye to come off.\n\nUsed dandruff shampoo 2 times cause I thought one wasn't enough. After I dried and brushed it, my hair that was in a bright ass blue, now was in a more soft, minty, aqua\/greenish hair color. Even though its still really bright, I ended up liking it a lot, reminds me of The Owl House Amity or Life is Strange Chloe Price.\n\nThank you all for the tips and advices once again!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1654705814.0},{"title":"Wholesome pharmacy experience :)","author":"SavvySillybug","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/v7zgk1\/wholesome_pharmacy_experience\/","text":"Just to set the scene - I am the customer in this story. But I thought maybe you lot might appreciate a wholesome story where nothing goes wrong and everybody is happy.\n\nThis story is set in Germany, but I don't think that really matters. Two weeks ago I sent an email to my doctor to get my prescription meds, somehow that never arrived despite them sending it, no harm done, today I just went there personally to grab a copy of the prescription and get it done myself. I called a nearby pharmacy (or Apotheke here in Germany) to ask if they had my medicine in stock, but they did not, so I asked them not to bother and I'd just get it from the one near my actual house instead. Pleasant conversation and it ended nicely.\n\nSo now I called my local Apotheke instead, and this time I already knew they wanted the PZN code on my prescription, so I gladly offered that, and they immediately found the medicine in their system. The time was 15:30 and they said they could get it delivered by 17:30, but they closed at 18:00. I said yes of course that would work nicely, I'd be there later.\n\nSo I get home, waste an hour of time, and head out to the pharmacy that's practically next door. I wait in line, using their complimentary disinfectant dispenser while I wait, rubbing it all into my hands. The customer in front of me is a man using crutches, he could clearly stand without them, but he was moving awkwardly and limping, setting his crutches against the counter as he did his transaction. The lady behind the counter was sad to inform him that his medication was not in stock, but she could get it delivered by tomorrow. He sounded very saddened by this, so she offered to deliver it to his house instead, which he gladly accepted. I patiently stood there as he gathered his belongings and paid for additional pain medication. I'm here for my daily sanity potion, not actual physical motion stuff, I don't mind standing in line. The guy on crutches looked over his shoulder and noticed me, and he shuffled away from the register to gather his belongings elsewhere, so I gladly thanked him and moved up.\n\nI presented my prescription and the lady behind the counter entered it into her system. She said they didn't have it in stock, but they could get it delivered by tomorrow. I said I called ahead and was assured it would be in by 17:30 - it was now 17:40 - and she checked the system. She said the delivery guy hadn't arrived yet, but he would probably get here within the next ten minutes. She also said she had to check my prescription because it said DUPLICATE on it, and that was suspicious, so I explained to her how I got it mailed to me but it never arrived, so I got a duplicate from the doctor. Armed with that knowledge, she headed to the rear of the Apotheke to get it sorted out.\n\nI don't know who she spoke with, but apparently that story checked out, so she told me she would probably have my meds for me in the next ten minutes. I asked to confirm that they closed at 18:00 and she said yes indeed they did.\n\nSo I went outside in the rain, found a nearby building with some umbrellas, and just stood there for the next ten minutes, waiting, while chatting on Discord on my phone.\n\nSoon enough,  I saw a largely unmarked white van park in front of the pharmacy, it was about 17:55 at this point. I walked back to the pharmacy and saw the little \"Apotheke - urgent medication\" sticker on the back. I walked near him and watched him unload some boxes onto a little board with wheels and went inside behind him as he wheeled it in. The lady behind the counter smiled and nodded at me as I walked in, and then said it would be a few more minutes to unload it all, and she offered me a seat in the corner while I waited. I gladly took it and waited.\n\nA few moments later, another customer came in, who had apparently also been waiting on the free medicine delivery, and the kind lady behind the counter served him first. I didn't make a fuss about that despite me technically being in front of him in queue and asked to wait. She looked at me just as he got done paying, and I got up, giving her the name of my medication as she asked, and handing her my prescription again as she asked for it.\n\nShe got me my meds for two months and took my 10\u20ac. And then, something slightly magical happened. Normally, at this pharmacy, they ask you if you want to partake in the rewards program, and then they hand you one little cardboard rewards chip per 10\u20ac spent. This time, she did not ask me, and she handed me four of those chips instead of the one I was owed.\n\nI can only assume that is her way of thanking me for being patient and kind. Up until that point, I merely felt that what I was doing was the bare minimum of social interaction and general decency. But this lovely lady gave me four times the rewards points because it was the only thing she could do to thank me for waiting and being nice the whole time. I don't even know how to redeem these, but I will treasure them forever. Being kind is awesome. Thank you for appreciating me, random kind German pharmacy lady. And also thank you for giving me the medicine I need to be a sane and productive member of society. And thank you German healthcare system for letting me call a random pharmacy and get the right medicine, of a specific brand, delivered within 3 hours. And for me only paying 10\u20ac to get two months worth of the stuff.\n\nI have been blessed by four little cardboard rectangles and I need to tell the world about it. Kindness is awesome and makes everyone's day better. Even the little gestures matter the world to those who are kind to staff. Every little price reduction, free thing, upgrade, all of it matters so much, and encourages further kindness. Thank you all for being nice to the kind customers that behave like they should.

Yesterday I shared [the story](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/v3bljm\/karen_accuses_me_of_stealing_from_her_store\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of the time when one of the employees followed me to my car while accusing me of stealing, and going through my bag to see if all of the items I had with me were on the receipt. People have pointed out that I should have reported her, which, had I known that what she was doing was wrong, I would have. But I never saw her again afterwards so I'm guessing that the security cameras captured everything, and she was fired. At least that's what I hope happened. In any case, here's another incident that happened with that same pharmacy the other day, which I still am rather annoyed about.\n\nSince the pandemic started, they (and a lot of other stores) have improved and been promoting their home-delivery services. According to their website, you can get most prescriptions other than ones that require an ID delivered, along with store products (important detail for later). Although I still often go to the pharmacy to pick stuff up, sometimes its easier to have stuff delivered. I used to live fairly close by to the pharmacy, but I recently moved, and where I'm living now is farther away from the pharmacy, though it is still my local branch.\n\nSo the other day, I got a notification that one of my prescriptions which was set to automatically refill was ready at the pharmacy located at (my local pharmacy branch's address), and I could either come pick it up or have it delivered. I opted to have it delivered. It then gave me the option of adding some store products to my order to have delivered along with the prescription. I was almost out of my over-the-counter sleep-aids, so I added them to my order, paid for everything and received my receipt via email. Both of the items I paid for were on the receipt (another important detail for later). Everything went through smoothly and I received a notification that my order would be delivered later that day, and it gave me an estimated time for the delivery.\n\nA few hours passed and nobody had come to the door yet. So I went outside to check to see if they had left my order on the doorstep. Sure enough, they had (they state very clearly on their website that someone must be home in order to accept the delivery). My prescription had been sitting out in the hot sun for who knows how long. But that wasn't what was bothering me.\n\nI felt the bag and could tell right away that there was only one bottle inside, and I could tell that it was the prescription and NOT the sleep-aids. While at the end of the day the prescription was more important than the sleep-aids, it still irked me, because I had paid for both items to be delivered.\n\nI had enough of the sleep-aids to last through the night, but the next morning I decided to find out why they hadn't been delivered when I had paid for them and was told they'd be arriving within a certain time frame. So I called the my local store and made my way through their automated system to the option to speak to customer service. The lady who answered didn't speak English very well. I told her that I never received an item that I had ordered along with my prescription. She sounded confused, then said \"We don't do that\". I asked what she meant and again, she said \"We don't do that\". I then told her that I had paid for the item and had it on my receipt. She then said \"Call corporate\", and hung up.\n\nSo I called the corporate number. I was connected to one person, who took down my info, etc., then asked how he could assist me. I told him that I hadn't received an item I had ordered for delivery. He asked if it was a prescription or a store product. I said it was an order for both a prescription and a store product, but I had only received the prescription. He then asked which branch I ordered from, and after giving him the info, he said that they don't deliver store products at that particular branch, and that I should have received a notification. I told him that I never received a notification that delivery for store products was not available at that location, and that I had a receipt showing that I had paid for both items. He then transferred me to someone else.\n\nThe next person I spoke to again took down my basic info, and I, again, explained that I never received an item that I had paid to be delivered, and was told that my pharmacy doesn't deliver store products; they only deliver prescriptions. He told me that was correct; they only deliver prescriptions, and that I should have received a notification saying my payment for the sleep-aids had been refunded. I looked through my messages but couldn't find any such notification, I only found the receipt for when I placed the order. I told him I didn't receive it, so he said he would send it again (and almost immediately my phone made the \"notification\" sound). Despite being extremely frustrated at this point, I thanked him politely and then hung up.\n\nSo they only deliver prescriptions at my pharmacy, but not store products? It didn't really make sense. The thing that I really was annoyed about was that it should have said something along the lines of \"We're sorry, this service is unavailable at the selected location\" on the website, but instead it processed my payment.\n\nNeedless to say I was extremely annoyed. If you don't offer a particular service at your store, why does your website say that you do? I am lucky that I am able to drive to the pharmacy and get it, so it wasn't really a big deal for me. Perhaps next time I have to go to the pharmacy I'll explain the situation to someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I ordered both a prescription and a store product from my local pharmacy to be delivered to my house. I never received the store product. When I called and asked them about it, they told me that they don't deliver store products at that branch; only prescriptions. I was annoyed because it should have said on their website that delivery for those items was unavailable at my location.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1654370514.0},{"title":"Dealership service (or lack of)","author":"GioPetro","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/v50ifg\/dealership_service_or_lack_of\/","text":"I recently brought my car in for service at a dealership near my mother in laws house.

I am a  regular customer at the local branch of a certain pharmacy\/drug store  chain with three letters in its name. I am friendly with many of the  employees there, to the point where they really don't have to verify my  name, date of birth etc. (even though they still do so because required)  and I often find myself engaging in conversations with the pharmacy  staff while they fill my prescriptions.\n\nNow  this store allows you to purchase non-pharmacy items at the pharmacy  counter, so on this particular day, I picked out some items that I  needed, brought them to the pharmacy counter, and paid for them along  with my prescription medications. I exchange my usual small talk with  the pharmacist, get my receipt, put everything in my reusable shopping  bag, and walk out the door.\n\nMy car  is parked a short distance away from the door. Right as I'm reaching my  hand out to unlock the car door, I hear it; the unmistakable cry of the  Karen.\n\nKE: Excuse me?!!\n\nI  turn around and see an employee who I have seen before (sitting out in  front of the store taking a smoke break) but have never interacted with.  She was an older woman, probably early 60s, had somewhat of a  Karen-esque hairdo, and was looking at me as if I was the scum of the  earth.\n\nMe: Yes?\n\nKE: Did you pay for those?!!\n\nMe: I did, why?\n\nKE: Well I didn't see you at the checkout line! Did you pay for these at the pharmacy?!!\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nWithout  even asking, she starts going through my bag, looking for the receipt. I  think it would have been obvious that I had been at the pharmacy  counter given the multiple bags of prescriptions with my name on them.  She eventually finds the receipt, and looks at it to verify that all the  other items in the bag were on the receipt.\n\nKE:  Next time you purchase something at the pharmacy counter, you need to  show the receipt to one of the cashiers at the checkout line! We've had a  major problem with shoplifters! Have a nice day! (She turns around and  leaves).\n\nMe: Yes ma'am. (Slightly irritated, I get into my car and drive home.)\n\nI'm  pretty sure she made up that rule about showing the receipt to the  cashier as you were leaving the store right then and there. For one  thing, this was not one of those stores where an employee stands by the  door with a marker and checks your receipt as you're walking out. The  checkout lines are near the entrance, but they usually only have one  register open, so the cashier at the register is often too busy ringing  someone up to pay attention to anyone entering or especially exiting the  store. This would mean that, in order to follow her rule, I'd have to  stand at the end of the line and wave my receipt until the cashier  notices me, which could potentially take a long time as often there's  someone in the line who's having some sort of issue with their credit  card and the cashier is too busy helping them to notice. Also, if I had  taken something from the store without paying for it, I'm pretty sure an  alarm would have gone off.\n\nMy  only guess as to why this lady thought I was a thief was because of my  appearance. Like I said, I have long hair and a beard, and she must have  thought I was some sort of \"punk\" who liked to steal things. Either  that or she mistook me for a homeless person. I don't know why she  suddenly decided to accuse me of stealing when she's seen me there  before, and like I said, I'm friendly with a lot of the other employees.  In any case, I never saw this lady again after this incident.\n\nNot  the most juicy story, but I thought I'd share it anyway. What's  interesting to note is that since this incident, the pharmacy introduced  the option of having your receipt texted or emailed to you, as opposed  to printed. Also, they recently added self-checkout lanes, so on the  rare occasions where I go to that store to get something other than my  prescription meds, I checkout through there now. Fortunately, there's a  loud computerized voice that will announce to the world that you've  opted to have your receipt emailed to you.\n\nTL;DR,  An employee at a pharmacy\/drug store that I'm a regular customer at  accuses me of stealing because I purchased my items at the pharmacy  counter, not the checkout line. She goes through my bag looking for the  receipt, and makes up a rule that I have to flag down a cashier and show  the receipt to them before I leave. I'm pretty sure she profiled me  because I have long hair and a beard.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1654184112.0},{"title":"Local Chinese place is the best!","author":"StrangeButSweet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/v2xn3q\/local_chinese_place_is_the_best\/","text":"We have a local Chinese joint that we\u2019ll call Number Three Minus Two Chinese.

So it was expensive.  Quite expensive.   So within a matter of hours I became responsible for paying my entire annual out of pocket cost allowed under my health insurance (around $7,200).  \n\nAs would be obvious to anyone looking at this, I lost some time at work so I lost income.   They must have billed insurance immediately because I apparently got my first bill about a week after the surgery.  However I was not able to get my own mail at the time plus I was just in no position to deal with bills immediately.  So then the second bill came about 5 weeks after my surgery and it was now \u201cpast due.\u201d   There are very few schmucks, at least on this side of the city, who can get an unexpected bill for 7 grand and just be able to write a check.   So I call the \u201cFinancial Advocates\u201d to request some type of plan to spread out payments.   Being a charity, they are required to have a financial assistance program to help lower bills for people who cannot pay them, but the way their policy is written it covers exactly nobody.   \n\nSo I get the \u201cadvocate\u201d on the phone and it seems like she\u2019s following a script.  She first says \u201cokay, I see your balance is blah blah and your account is past due, let me know when you have your card number ready and I can take payment over the phone.\u201d   I didn\u2019t want to be rude, but like this fools nobody and both she and I knew I didn\u2019t have $7 grand to pay her that day.  So I start put polite and explain that and she immediately starts pressuring me, stating things that were really irrelevant, like the balance was very high, etc.   I kind of laughed and said if I had seven grand, I wouldn\u2019t be on the phone with her.     Then she says \u201cwell, we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s anything we can do\u201d and puts me on hold.   \n\nShe comes back on and said she can make a deal with me and I could pay $2,800 that day and then $524 per month going forward.  For the record, I have a professional career, but my profession is heavily dominated by women so we are grossly underpaid so I\u2019m not exactly rolling in the dough.   And I\u2019m a single parent who just missed two paychecks so nobody was getting $2,800 from me no matter what the reason was.      \n\nSo we play this game back and forth where she tries to guilt me and then offers tiny improvements to my payment plan, making each one sound like it\u2019s the most generous thing anyone could ever offer.    At a certain point I just hit my limit and said \u201cI\u2019m not playing this game anymore.   This is what I can afford ($500 that day and $200\/mo).\u201d    This is a very substantial monthly cost for me, so I would already be stretched thin.   She then went on again about how high my bill was and I was getting more irritated, as if I wasn\u2019t the one who was actually experiencing in my own body how severe the injury was.  \n\nShe just kept refusing and trying to get me to pay like $20 more.  But by this time I was ready to dig my heels in and I wouldn\u2019t budge.  I said this is what I can afford.  Nothing you can say will change that reality.    So we finally agreed on about $205\/mo.    But it took 45 minutes and it most certainly did not improve my health.  \n\nSo I\u2019m wondering if anyone has ever had to do this job before and can tell me the best way to get around this stupid and dehumanizing script (for both her and I) so that I can have a genuine and normal conversation with someone?    What are the magic words?

I know the sheets are changed and the the bathroom is given a once over, but there is a level of dirt that tells me they vacuum the middle of the floor and wipe the top surfaces but nothing else.\n\n\nThis trip, though, every single room had an issue.  First room the toilet was broken.  You could flush but then it would run unless you took the tank lid off and fiddled with the float and stopper.  I let the front desk know.  The FDA claimed she knew how to fix it, came up and did exactly what I'd done with the float and stopper.  The next time I flushed, it ran again.  So not so much of a fix.  The FDA really expected me to take the tank lid off every time I flushed.\n\n\nThe second room the toilet worked, but wobbled severely, as if the bolts holding it to the floor were loose.\n\n\nThe third room I do what I always do as soon as I get in the room.  I sat on the bed to see how crappy the mattress was.  It seemed great!  Except that was just the end of the bed.  The side I slept on had a giant hole where I sunk to the bottom of the mattress.  My husband didn't believe me because his side was fine.  I had him sit on my side and watched him sink to the bottom.\n\n\nIn the next room, the TV remote didn't fully work.  The guide button did nothing and the aspect ratio could not be set to make the picture fit the screen.\n\n\nThe next room had a shade and sheer curtains.  Except the shade only went half way down, so you were blinded by the morning sun as you lay in bed.  This room also had a shower curtain that was in no way water resistant.  Even with the curtain properly placed inside the tub and pulled to close the gaps at each end, there was a half gallon of water on the floor afterward. The water just seeped through the curtain, and collected on the edge of the tub until it spilled over.\n\n\nThen there are the doors that have a 1\" gap at the bottom so you can hear every sound from the hallway.  And the ones that slam shut loudly no matter how quietly you try to close them.  Because no one needs to sleep in a hotel, right?\n\n\nThen there's the jet engine toilet.  It had some sort of pneumatic flush assist that made it impossible to flush without waking up everyone in the room.\n\n\nTwo rooms had refrigerators that either didn't keep things cold or froze everything.  One had a microwave with a visible burn mark in the door.\n\n\nI book 3 star hotels.  Prices range from $120 - $200 a night.  I've tried 5 different brands between the two trips.  Out of 10 nights I did not have a single room that was was fully functional.  Oddly enough, the best room was the cheapest.\n\n\nI know COVID took a toll on the hotel industry, but I'm at the point where I'm considering camping instead of paying for a hotel room, because I'd get just as much rest if not more for a lot less money.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1654093626.0},{"title":"Shitty Haircuts, Being Ignored, Awful Quality","author":"SharpenedShovel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/v2qrfb\/shitty_haircuts_being_ignored_awful_quality\/","text":"I can't even describe how mad I am over my last encounter at my closest hair place, and I have to vent.  I've been there for my last two haircuts, I gave them a second chance after a bad experience, and was screwed over yet again. The first hairdresser was completely rude, I sat in her chair in silence for like 2 minutes while she finished her conversation with her coworker. Then I got a monotone \"so how do you want your hair cut....\". She just didn't seem to want to be cutting hair. I was also curtly instructed to \"sit down more\" because I'm tall and she was short. I have no issue with sitting on my lower back for 5-10 minutes, but she was rude about it, like it's my fault for being tall.\n\nThe second time, I got a different cutter, I asked for a trim, but when I tried to mention cleaning up the back of my neck, the short lady from last time interrupted me to tell my hairdresser \"The washing machine is broken\". That wasn't urgent at all, and they started joking about it.  \"Oh, we can't do perms. We can't fill the water bottles, we can't even do haircuts, HAHAHA!\" (doesn't even make sense). i'm paying for this hairdresser's time and attention, and she's talking to a co-worker over me. She made small-talk with me for very little time, trimmed me, and suddenly she took the sheet off mid-sentence, without asking about shaving my neck, or if there was anything else I wanted done. I also mentioned thinning the hair out, which she simply didn't do either (I don't even think she was listening to me). Once she took the sheet and neck lining off, I felt awkward asking her to go back and do more.\n\nI honestly feel like I got scammed, I was in the chair for about 3-4 minutes. \"Is there anything else you want me to do today?\" should be said every time. Or at the very least, listen to your customer instead of talking to your coworker, or prattling on about mundane topics. I just paid $23 for a trim, and my neck is covered in fuzz, maybe offer to clean it up. Or, don't talk over people who are trying to tell you what they want. It seemed like they just wanted me out as fast as possible so they could chit-chat amongst themselves more, it's just insulting and I feel ripped off, and insignificant, as if they were just sheering a sheep and talking over an animal.

The fabric ripped and has been sagging down.\n\nThey said they\u2019d need 5 days since they had to order the part in, but they took 7 days. I didn\u2019t get a call or anything telling me they needed extra time. I tried calling on the 6th day to find out what was going on but no one knew anything. Then immediately after the phone call I got sent a video of them detailing what they were doing to fix the sunshade. Ok great! I call back to find out when it\u2019d be done but again, no one knew anything and said if I\u2019d gotten a video the person who sent it would call me back really soon. I didn\u2019t hear back for hours, so I called again and finally got ahold of someone that told me it\u2019d be done the next morning. \n\nMy husband picked up the car and he didn\u2019t think to check anything while he was there, which sucks because there were a few things wrong that we should\u2019ve had them correct right away. First, the sunshade was pulled all the way back, and when I tried to move it out I realized they hadn\u2019t even put it back on the motor track. I can\u2019t use it now. I also noticed that the visor lights weren't working anymore, and they had been working just fine when I took it in. To get to the sunshade they had to take off a lot of the roof of the car, so I\u2019m assuming either they forgot to reconnect the lights or broke them somehow. \n\nWe tried making an appointment to get these things fixed but they said they can't guarantee it'll be for free because they don't know the cause of the issues and if they\u2019re really at fault. What?? How is it not their fault?\n\nA couple other things we noticed: they broke our baby mirror in the backseat in half, which is a plastic safety mirror. It would take some serious manhandling to break that. They also took out the baby\u2019s car seat base and put it back incorrectly, which unfortunately we didn\u2019t notice until two days after. If we\u2019d gotten into an accident our baby wouldn\u2019t have been safe. They shouldn\u2019t have attempted to put it back at all if they didn\u2019t know what they were doing. And this one isn\u2019t a big deal but it was just the icing on the cake, there were shoe prints all over the backseat.

Basically the girl I was seeing at the time and I were going pretty strong (or so I thought back then) and I wanted her to meet them and have a bit of a holiday.\n\nOn the first evening, we went to one of my favourite restaurants in the world. It\u2019s an Asian fusion place that does really good street food style meals and while I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201cfancy\u201d, the food is just out of this world.\n\nAnyway, mum is a pescatarian (so she eats fish but not meat). It\u2019s more from habit than anything now, but she was pregnant with me when the foot and mouth outbreak happened and her doctor friends recommended not eating meat while she was pregnant. She just hasn\u2019t since and doesn\u2019t miss it.\n\nAfter a round of drinks, the waiter comes over and we order our food. Chicken Pad Thai for my GF and I and Beef Rendang for dad. Mum would usually go for a fish dish (they have this amazing king prawn curry there) but she decided to change things up and had the Tofu Stir Fry in black bean sauce.\n\nHalf an hour and another round of drinks later, the food comes out and as just 10\/10. Then the following exchange occurs\u2026\n\nMum: \u201cI just cannot believe how good this tofu is. Best Tofu I\u2019ve ever eaten. It\u2019s so firm and the sauce really adds a great flavour to it. Tofu is a risk sometimes because it doesn\u2019t really have its own flavour, but if prepared properly it can be delicious.

That solution sounded great until I called the place, and they said that repair isn't covered under warranty as the rep had stated it was, store said call 1800 again. \n\n2nd customer service rep: Send in the phone for repair. Cool that wouldn't be an issue if my phone wasn't also my work phone, and personal cell phone, not a big deal and I can live without a phone for a few days, but I asked what the turnaround time was, he said anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 months depending on parts availability!

I\u2019ve also contacted the hotel with the same information.\n\nSharing a story from Monday evening, May 16 2022. This will be lengthy but hopefully it\u2019s somewhat entertaining:\n\n1. We get on a US domestic flight that eventually lands in a different city \\~120 miles away due to bad weather, and we\u2019re told that we would have to take another flight the next day \/ make our own arrangements for the rest of the trip.\n2. We meet a Chinese lady and since we could also speak Mandarin, we started making plans to rent a car \/ Uber etc. together and share the cost, but none of that worked out (rental company ran out of cars, no Uber drivers).\n3. Eventually, we decide to stay the night at a hotel close to the airport. The ratings were good and according to Google, a Queen-bed room cost about $150 that night. \n4. The lady calls her son to make a booking for her, which he does, and he also calls the hotel to send a shuttle bus to get her. \n5. At the same time, we try to make an online booking at the same hotel through travel aggregator sites (Booking, Agoda etc.) which is unsuccessful. They seemed to have trouble accepting our non-US cards. Nevertheless, we decide to join the shuttle and book the room on the spot instead - which, as I understand, is something that hotels (generally) have no issue with.\n6. The shuttle comes, and the driver remarks: \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me there were 3 of you.\u201d, \u201che\u201d referring to the lady\u2019s son. We explain that we were in different groups but going to the same hotel. The driver then asks for my name, and I say J\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, which is an English name I\u2019ve used for years since many people have trouble pronouncing my ethnic Chinese one. It, however, is not in my official ID (This level of detail, while seemingly nonsensical, is a little tidbit for later.). She tells us to go ahead and board.\n7. It turns out the driver was also the counter staff at the hotel. After we arrive, she helps the lady check-in and provides impeccable service throughout the process: patiently answering questions, making small talk, providing clear instructions. Seems like the Google ratings weren\u2019t given for nothing, I think to myself as I wait in line.\n8. Once the lady was done, we step forward, show+explain the failed booking on our phone (see point 5), and ask if we could get a room on-the-spot. \n9. At this point, her demeanor completely changes, and she curtly asks: \u201cSo you weren\u2019t supposed to be on the van?\u201d - which is confusing since it implies you\u2019re not allowed on the van unless you have a valid booking, even if your every intention is to book a room at the hotel the van is going to.\n10. We explain our situation again (see point 6. This is also where the tidbit comes in). Grudgingly, she asks for my ID, and I hand my passport to her. A few seconds later, she asks: \u201cWhere\u2019s your name on this?\u201d, eloquently demonstrating one of the reasons I\u2019ve used an English name since I was a kid. I point it out, and she stares at me: \u201cSo your name is \\*not\\* J\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\u201d She sighs, shakes her head, and begins to type on her computer.\n11. Eventually, we get to paying for the room (\\~$200). The staff mentions that we have to sign on the pad after inserting the card, and attends to another lady at the counter while the payment terminal is loading. It loads, we insert the card (the same one that did not work online), and it asks for a PIN instead of a signature (which is expected, since this card does that).\n12. We type in the PIN, and the staff sees this from the corner of her eye. She raises her voice: \u201cYOU. HAVE. TO. SIGN. IT.\u201d, gesturing in the air so we understand what holding a pen and writing on a surface looks like.\n13. Like a perfectly choreographed musical, the terminal beeps right as she ends her sentence, and the word \u201cApproved\u201d flashes on the screen. I chuckle a bit to myself and grin at her, though it was probably concealed by my mask. She glances sideways and busies herself with something else.\n14. Eventually, we get to our room and settle in. A while later, I head back down to buy food from the pantry, and take the opportunity to ask the counter staff, who is now chipper and sprightly: \u201cHey, why were you so upset at us earlier?\u201d\n15. To extend the analogy of a musical (see point 13), she responds without missing a beat: \u201cBecause you weren\u2019t supposed to be on the van.\u201d which confuses me again (see point 9), to a point where I fail to ask the obvious question: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n16. Instead, I ask: \u201cBut did you have to be rude about it?\u201d She seems surprised, and asks back: \u201cDo you think I was rude?\u201d Since we were on a roll of questions, I was compelled to contribute one more: \u201cDid you not think you were rude?\u201d She ends the roll though, and confidently says \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n17. Recognizing that I wasn't getting past that ego, I share the full story of how we ended up there (see points 1-5) instead. She listens (presumably), looking at something on her computer the whole time.\n18. I finally get to the end, and this time, amazingly, she declares: \u201cI don\u2019t care about the van, it\u2019s not mine, I don\u2019t pay gas for it, I don\u2019t maintain it. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Considering points 6, 9, 15, I get confused again for the third time that night, except this time I realize I may not be the only one (there were 2 of us).\n19. I almost laugh at the absurdity of the situation, conclude that I might have been hearing things the whole night, and pay for the food with my card (taking special care to mention that it uses a PIN, so I don\u2019t get yelled at). I wish her a good night, she wishes me a good stay, and I go back to enjoy my supper in the room.\n\nSo it seems nobody really knows what that was about. In the absence of an explanation, we rely on the panacea everyone uses when someone is being nasty: \u201cThey were probably having a bad day.\u201d And that will soothe all hurts, and make it all okay.\n\nI generally expect bad service, but this cranks it up (or down) a notch. \n\nHave a good day all!","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1652902332.0},{"title":"Employee told me to put clothes back myself.","author":"KatzMwwow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/uspnog\/employee_told_me_to_put_clothes_back_myself\/","text":"I tried on two pieces of clothing today at a store that gave out numbers corresponding to the number of pieces you tried on.

The minimum wage here is about \u20ac560 a month and the average wage for waiters is about \u20ac900 a month. The average cost of living here for 1 person ranges from \u20ac350 to \u20ac700 depending on your lifestyle. Basically most waiters are paid a good living wage. Tipping culture is usually a case of round up to the nearest 5 or 10 because it isn't really required. \n\nThe story: \n\nI went to a restaurant near a local lake. The restaurant wasn't on the lake or particularly fancy, it was more a pub that serves some decent food. My friend and I were preparing for a day of sunbathing and paddle boarding and wanted to grab some food beforehand. We only chose this particular restaurant because it wasn't too far away from the lake by foot but far enough away to avoid the premium prices. \n\nWe went in, my friend wasn't too hungry so just got a side of fries and an ice coffee, I had a ceaser salad and a fresh orange juice. A little bit later on we also ordered two smoothies because we'd saw them get delivered to another table and they looked amazing, especially as a refreshing drink in the 35'c heat! \n\nThe waiter that served us had been lovely all throughout our time there. He'd been joking about practicing his English with us, given us prompt service and been overall just a happy and nice guy. Looking back, I do wonder if he maybe mistook us for Americans and therefore maybe expected a large tip if he did a good job. \n\nWhen it came time to pay the bill, I agreed with my friend that I would pay for it on my card then we would leave him a tip in cash as we both had lots of coins that we didn't want. The bill came to roughly \u20ac13 and we would have been leaving him about \u20ac5 in change. So a very large and above average tip! \n\nThe waiter came out, noticed my card and came across with the card machine. He held it out for me to input the total amount plus tip that I wanted to pay. As we were leaving a cash tip, i input the amount of the bill. When he saw this snarkily went \"Well! If that's what you think my service was worth, that's fine!\" He proceeded to throw the receipt down on the table, pick up the tray that we had yet to put our coins into and storm off. \n\nMy friend and I just looked at each other, shrugged and said \"well he clearly doesn't want a tip then!\" Before putting our purses away and leaving. \n\nI just found it so odd and definitely not anywhere near the normal experience I've had since I moved here 2 years ago! I've never once had a waiter be so salty that they didn't get a tip on a card payment that they would say something and take away the tray the bill comes on at the same time! I'm European myself and was pretty certain that it was pretty standard to pay on card and leave a cash tip in the tray?\n\nI guess we saved a bit of money and it did mean we were able to get an ice cream and beer later on in the day at a truck that only accepted cash.

When I had a chance, I listened to it and it was the owner, calling to ask me to pay for the cheesecake.  \n\nI called back, bc I couldn't believe the audacity of them to tell me it was on the house, then call the next day to change their minds, which I told the woman after she asked for my card number.  \n\nMe: Your employee told me it was 'on the house.' Those were her exact words.  When you tell someone that, it means they don't need to pay.\n\nHer: we do this anytime we have issues with our card machine, and no one has ever fought us on jt before.\n\nMe: well, I'm guessing you didn't tell *those* ppl it was 'on the house.'  \n\nThat was the gist of the conversation, with her getting progressively more rude and cussing at me.  I ended up hanging up on her and ignoring subsequent calls.  \n\nMaybe I should have just paid for the cheesecake.  We had the money for it, obviously, or we wouldn't have stopped there in the first place.  But man, I was already having a really bad day, and I had no clue if this woman even was who she said she was, and I wasn't giving out my card number over the phone.  \n\nMy day got progressively worse from there, so if I was wrong, karma for sure got me.  I hope her employee didn't get in trouble, but as rude as she was with me, I would not be at all surprised.  I do still feel like I was the one in the right, though.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1651011279.0},{"title":"Appointment canceled because of surgeon but I have to wait forever for my refund.","author":"throwtrivia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/ucf6bl\/appointment_canceled_because_of_surgeon_but_i\/","text":"I was supposed to get my wisdom teeth pulled 2 weeks ago.

The last time I went was for my 35th birthday last year, and I was treated very well. I never told them it was my birthday, they were just really nice.\n\nNow, this place has some very young servers working there and they have a tendency to be all over the place. A lot of running to different spots in the dining area to socialize with their coworkers. The more mature servers and the incredible food make up for it. I notice but I don't say anything. It doesn't directly affect me, even though it's not always the best look professionally.\n\nThe host connects me to this young woman server who brings me to my table. That QR code thing is on the table. They don't automatically give you the paper menus, you have to ask for them. I have a QR scanner app on my phone, and I know how to use it. That's not the issue. I just absolutely HATE reading a menu off my phone. Inevitably it either is a nightmare to navigate OR I have to constantly zoom in and out to read it and find what I want. It takes forever. Whereas with a physical menu, I can just open it and read it.\n\nThe server points out the QR code for me to view the menu and that it has all the items on it. I say thank you, then I asked her, \"Could I have one of your paper menus please? It's just a lot easier for me to read them.\" (I've always gotten a paper menu at this place, I know they have them, and every other restaurant I go to never argues with me about this).\n\nThe server: \"Really?\" Her tone was of pure annoyance.\n\nMe: \"Oh do you have to go search for one cause I don't want to take up your time?\" Cause I'm thinking maybe she'd have to run to the very back of the restaurant to dig out a paper menu.\n\nServer: \"No I have one here.\" She said still sounding annoyed. I realize there's a stack of paper under her notepad and she pulls out a paper menu, then slaps it down on the table.\n\nI should note that where I'm sitting is at this huge long table that has other people nearby. They've all seen this. They're all staring at us both. I'm actually embarrassed at that point, and I don't even know why because she had the menu right in her hand and it was nothing for her to hand it to me.\n\nThe server walks away. No one around me says anything. I can see out of the corner of my eye, talking vigorously to another server. Whether it's about me or not, I don't know, but again, not a good look.\n\nSo I'm thinking to myself, I'm not wanted here, so I'll leave. And that's what I did. I don't think I'll be back either. There wasn't another place I wanted to go so I ended up just going back home.\n\nUPDATE: I wrote a review on their facebook page. I felt that was the place where it would be most likely seen and possibly responded to.\n\nTo summarize, I said what happened and the reasons why I would not return. I felt embarrassed, unwanted and considering how they behave, it has really turned me off to coming there again.\n\nI have not heard from any manager. There are a few people who have responded to my review, one person who said they had a similar experience, and two others who were saying things about how glad they are I won't go back. One of those two isn't the server I dealt with, but I've seen him there and I know he works there. He's either a complete moron or he can say something like that without fear of retribution. Either way, what the hell?\n\nWhat's dumb about this is now that it looks a bit like the problem goes deeper than just one rude server, they've seem to have forgotten what city they are in. Word of mouth travels FAST around here. I shared my review on my profile, then with a few friends of mine.\n\nIf a manager ever does respond I'll post another update.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1650822951.0},{"title":"MIL was taken advantage by a cable company.

Moreover, or cable company was the same as the one that was being offered to her.\n\nFast forward to today. The installer came to her house, fixed the outside wiring, then set up her wireless router in her living room, obviously connected to nothing. Before leaving, he gave me a small scrap of paper with her Wifi name and password. She then asked me what the password was for. \n\n\"Oh, this is usually used to connect your computer or other devices to the internet, but the only device you have that's capable of that is your cell phone, but you're already connected to it through our WiFi connection.\"\n\n\"Oh. But what about when I'm out?\"\n\n\"Well then it connects to the internet with your phone's data.\"\n\n\"So I'm connected to the internet through your machine?\" She refers to our router as machinery.\n\n\"Yes. When you're here you connect to the internet with our router upstairs. How much are you paying for this service?\"\n\n\"The man said it was free because of a government program for seniors.\"\n\nShe paused a moment in thought then continued \"Well at least now I can go to the internet without bothering you,\" she said, trying to justify her new service although her Wifi usage barely registered a blip on our router. \"I just have to wait for the other phone to arrive.\"\n\n\"What other phone? Did that man sell you a phone?\"\n\n\"Yes. He said this one wouldn't connect because it was from SoAndSo company. So he sold me a phone and all I have to pay is $7 a month for it.\"\n\nMy turn to register what she said. \"Wait, your phone can connect to the service. It doesn't matter what phone it is since you  just connecting to the internet with our router.\"\n\n\"But he said it wouldn't work because their service isn't compatible with [the phone carrier]\"\n\n\"We connect to it all the time.

I had read a review in a national magazine that stated this bakery (let's call it Sister Imelda's, in a midwestern college town famous for ag degrees and basketball) was supposedly one of the best bakeries in the U.S.  I was excited to go there and try some of their baked goods.\n\nThe bakery is in a refurbished steakhouse that rhymes with Lions. I didn't hold that against them, they did a good job remaking the space into their own. The walls are lined with cabinets of goodies, imagine the bakery aisle at your grocery store times twenty. A really *huge* variety. OK... so far so good.\n\nHowever, after looking around, I realized that there were no titles, descriptions or prices. So, what am I looking at? There are ZERO signs. Are there nuts in it? What's the filling? Is that maple? Or maybe apple. Perhaps apricot. Who knows? If you are a local or perhaps familiar with this type of bakery, you know the prices and what things are, good for you. But what about the new customer? Oh well.\n\nThere were a lot of people there loading up trays and going up front, speaking Spanish (which I have no problem with) to the cashier and getting their items and leaving. So knowing the language and familiarity with the items may have been key, I don't know.\n\nThere was really nobody to ask about things. I tried asking the one older woman working there but she said \"No speak English\" to me and walked away. There were only 2 people working. That's it, one at the cash register and the one old woman.\n\nI can't imagine having a nut allergy or an apple allergy and trying to shop there. What I thought was a lemon pastry turned out to be (I think...) pineapple. It wasn't great. What I thought was a coffee cake turned out to be a very dry strudel. What my friend thought was an apple cheesecake of some kind turned out to be some kind of dry, solidified bread pudding in a wedge.\n\nHow much was each pastry? \n\nWho knows? I guess the customer was not supposed to worry about cost. Just walk up to the cash register and get a surprise. And, BTW, if you don't have items over 10 bucks? Guess what? You get charged a dollar more if you want to use your credit card. I didn't want to be embarrassed by asking the cashier to price each one and stupidly I assumed it wouldn't really be that much.\n\nMy luck, the price was pretty high for pastry (and this was 4 years ago, pre-pandemic). I got 4 small pastries (2 kinds of which were barely filled with any filling and VERY dry, one had zero taste at all) and two *small* cups of coffee. 9 dollars and change. Plus the extra dollar for not being over 10 bucks and using a card. I could have gotten a DOZEN assorted doughnuts at a chain for under that price and they would have actually tasted a lot better. \n\nThe no price\/no signs thing seemed like a total scam to me. They could charge whatever they want at the cash register. Perhaps more if you look like you can afford it, maybe less if they know you. Needless to say, I did not ever go back. Dry, flavorless pastries at a high price? No thanks.\n\n(I thought of my experience, because some friends described almost the exact same thing about a bakery in [big city], KY that had the same situation.)","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1650833179.0},{"title":"I had to speak to a manager today.","author":"raisanett1962","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/uah4bq\/i_had_to_speak_to_a_manager_today\/","text":"My small city has three restaurants owned by the same guy, and I have a gift card good for all three.

So I moved next to the line and waited. I really wanted to tell my family what was going on, but my phone battery was dead and I would have needed to leave and find an outlet for that. So instead I just stood there, staring into space, and silently screaming in my head. \n\nAfter what seemed a long time, but probably was only something like 10-15 minutes, she motioned me over, and told me she had moved me around - I was now booked on a plane of a different airline, going to the same destination. It left later than my previous one, but that one included a connection while the new one was a direct flight, so in the end it was something like a 20 minutes difference. I thanked her profusely, waited for my plane, boarded, passed out, and woke up in my country.\n\nSo, thanks, airport lady.

I use masking tape to obviously mask off certain areas of the dollhouse and the furniture when painting.\n\nYesterday, I tried to buy a couple of rolls of this masking tape from this store that rhymes with Mal-Beans. For some reason the price wasn't coming up right, and there was a bunch of people in line, and another person who had already been waiting for a manager to come figure out why her item's sale price wasn't ringing up correctly. I decided I didn't want to make people wait, so I said I didn't want the masking tape and paid for everything else.\n\nI went back this afternoon to try yet again to get said masking tape.\n\nSo I get the same two rolls from the same aisle they were in before.\n\nThere's one person ahead of me finishing up their purchase, and no one behind me. Yay! A manager strolls up and hops onto the unmanned register and calls me over. Yay! She rings up my other stuff then gets to the masking tape. The price won't come up at all. She looks at the register like it just failed at being a register, like how dare it not ring up this masking tape correctly.\n\nShe gets on the mic and calls out to the universe for assistance with a price check. Yay!\n\nA nice woman who's restocking shelves calls out that it is discontinued. In my mind: \"I might have to go buy more expensive masking tape at the grocery store way up the road and I really don't want to\".\n\nManager says to me, \"How much does masking tape usually go for?\"\n\nI shrug, and I'm like, \"I so seldom ever buy it that I have no idea.\" I should've said 25 cents or something but when given such a golden opportunity it never occurs to me to do that. We're both laughing as she's waiting for a bigger manager to approve a price.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a line building. I look to my right and this guy has tons of stuff and looks so irritated about waiting. The other two people in line are looking around, sighing, mumbling, the usual stuff people do when they have to wait longer than they should. By this point it had been a while. I knew an impending discount was coming my way, I wanted it, so, I was just gonna wait until they figure it out.\n\nBigger manager approves each roll for a dollar a piece. I'm like, \"Cool! Sign me up!\" Turns out the old price was over $2.00, so that's about a 50% discount which I can get behind. I look to my right again and the guy who's next in line looks like he hates me dearly. We had been at this for maybe 5 or so minutes, not that I was keeping track but that's how long it felt.\n\nI pay, say thank you, she says have a great day, I say you too, and I'm out of there.\n\nI typically won't ever make employees jump around for something so simple, and I don't like to make people wait. I really, really don't. But goodness, trying to paint tiny furniture without masking off certain areas can end up really sloppy and I sell my miniatures so I can't have them looking sloppy. Also, being an artist and having to wait to do any kind of creative anything is really agitating. I just keep telling myself the people I made wait I'll probably never see again for the rest of my life.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1650404428.0},{"title":"I had a bad feeling about this bathroom at the breakfast hut.","author":"narcolepticdoc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/u7hrbu\/i_had_a_bad_feeling_about_this_bathroom_at_the\/","text":"So in the middle of a holiday road trip (kinda, it\u2019s a long story that involves a flat tire and an extra 1000 miles of driving) my friend and I stop for food at an establishment known for very small restaurants that only serve breakfast. \n\nAfter we order I head to the only bathroom and immediately notice that the toilet is unflushed.

I said at the end of my last post that I hoped I wouldn't have to update again, but here I am.\n\nToday is 1 and a bit months on from my previous post. I've been happy with Mergin Vidia, and thought it would go smoothly with ChatChat, but I had that voice in the back of my head saying they'll never make it that easy. Given I'm posting again, you know which was right.\n\nToday, I received a Final Demand for my bill, stating if I don't pay, it'll be sent to a debt collectors and noted on my credit file. I'd paid off over half on the 14th April - earlier than my projected date of the 16th for payment! - and 5 days later (presuming it took a while to go through with the bank holidays), a Final Notice appears in my email inbox. For the full amount. So I go onto their customer service live chat, and find out that they don't particularly care what I'd agreed with another agent. \n\nThey can't stop the notices being sent out, and refuse to try, even though they can clearly see in my previous notes that I have dates agreed upon to pay it back, and a notice from a manager that because of their previous fuck up, I don't get any late fees. So I ask for the manager cause I'm DONE dealing with this and everyone telling me that the last person lied and there's nothing they can do.\n\nManager comes on and states again that there's nothing they can do so suck it up (not those exact words but thats the vibe I got), she can't stop the notices, she can't stop it from being sent to debt collectors, ill just have to pay on the 16th, and hope that it doesn't get sent before then because \"there's no exact time frame for when it'll be transferred.\" This, I know is bullshit. Any other company I've had to work with on the rare time I haven't been able to pay my bill on time has worked with me 100% to make sure it didn't negatively impact my credit score and gave me ample time to repay what I owed, even if I was an ex-customer. So either ChatChat has the WORST system in the world for customers who've left, or this manager just doesn't want to help.\n\nShe eventually gave me the complaints email address after I listed all the exact problems I've had with this ONE bill, and explained its a little discriminatory to ONLY offer help and resolution via phone calls, given I can't make them due to cognitive issues and adverse affects on my health if I try (it takes me a lot longer to process spoken words than written ones, especially if they have an unfamiliar accent, and I forget words a lot when I'm speaking, so it'd take 10x as long to resolve over the phone, and I have really bad anxiety so several panic attacks would happen if I attempted to resolve over the phone) which is noted in my account why I cannot do phone calls.\n\nSo now I have to go through the complaints procedure, hopefully via email, to make sure I don't get debt collectors sent to me and a negative mark on my credit file. All over \u00a380 which they will have in one months time, which they've known about since 14\/03\/2022.\n\nUpdate 2 will follow with the resolution of the complaints procedure.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1650377129.0},{"title":"store refuses to refund or deliver mattress that they lost in transit.","author":"nonameneeded2340","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/u6jn3o\/store_refuses_to_refund_or_deliver_mattress_that\/","text":"So this happened recently, on Mobile so apologies for any formatting or grammatical errors. \n\nMe and my SO just moved into our first home and as such needed to buy everything, this included a new bed and mattress.

After today, I really don't know what to think after the treatment I received by one of the main receptionists, 'M'.\n\nBefore I continue, this past December I had an issue with her after she tried accusing me of not paying for their services **eight** months prior!  The firm only accepts checks for payment since eliminating their online payment portal, so receiving this call was unusual.\n\nI went back to my checkbook, pulled the check number and date it was written from my check register.  This proved payment was sent out in April which was within the month I received the invoice.  While we were on the phone, I looked up my online statement from April onward to discover that the check never cleared.  'M' seemed to be on my side and apologized if it was their end that lost my original check.  As inconvenient as this was, albeit annoying, human error happens.  I wasn't going to hold this against 'M' or anyone else.\n\nI asked her to give me leeway for that day so I could find out more information from my bank and put a stop payment on the check. As soon as I got the ok of the stop payment, I would call back that I was sending another check.  Meanwhile, I had to incur a $35.00 stop payment fee, which I was not offered reimbursement for, nor did I ask for.  Still, I did what I told 'M' I was going to do, sent another check, and figured that was the end of it.  \n\nFast forward to now:  Last Thursday, my completed tax return was sent to me by 'M'.  I noticed six pages in that there were instructions requiring my driver's license or state ID number for \"anti-fraud measures and to expedite the return to be processed\".  I was on break at work and called the accountant's office to provide the information.  'M' answered, yet she wasn't sure what I meant until I told her where I read this.  She assured me that the statement was \"generated by the software they use\", they did not need to forward my driver's license number to the accountant, but thanked me for bringing it to her attention.\n\nIn turn, I thanked 'M' and concluded the phone call, except she stopped me by stating that she needed payment via credit card immediately.  It struck me as odd, especially since there was never any formal notice sent out that payments were no longer billed on 30 day invoices. Instead, I brought to 'M's attention that the forms needing my signature to e-file were not attached to my original return, thus my taxes were technically incomplete.  She apologized, then emailed them.  I signed and uploaded both forms to the document portal, then responded to her email that the forms were completed and the name of the document.  Not a peep about payment on her end.\n\nApparently the issue of the e-file forms was client-wide because this morning the accountant *himself* sent out an email addressing the issue.  He further asked to call the office ASAP and speak with 'M' to confirm the receipt of the forms or receive the missing documents.  As soon as I greeted her, she said that she did receive my email last week, then began berating me for \"not calling back when you said you would with payment!\"\n\nI was pretty taken aback, yet I calmly recalled our conversation from the week before.  She took what I said and twisted the conversation that *I* left her hanging when it came to paying.  \n\n> \"Now, *we* need a CREDIT CARD or we cannot release the return to YOU\".\n\nAll of a sudden there was a numbness that washed over me because she was - in so many words - strongly implying that the timeliness of my taxes were going to be tampered with unless I remitted payment.  What do I do?  This is my word against hers.  How do I trust that the person on the other end is not going to mishandle my credit card number out of spite?\n\nOne thing was for certain and threatening me was not ok.  So I took a breath and said exactly that to her, and emphasized that if my e-file status was going to be held up, I needed to know when 30 day invoices were done away with.  \n\nThere was an audible pause on her end.  I could feel her seething at me through the phone as she spat out, \"Well, I AM just going to have to talk to [accountant's name] and have his opinion\".  'M' stuck me on hold for a few minutes to be on baited breath with orchestral music.  She returned and told me very matter-of-fact:\n\n> \"[Accountant's name] will put through your return, but WE expect payment from you after you receive it.\"  I asked her to thank him and she hung up on me.\n\nThe whole exchange was pointless and seriously has me questioning if I *want* to remain a client.  By no means is this the accountant's fault, although I respect him enough not to want to raise a situation where he has to choose a side. If it is my word against hers, I half expect that I would be released as a client.  Who knows what 'M' would say that is untruthful about me?\n\nThe fact remains, though, that I do not appreciate being treated like I'm some flunkie who makes excuses so I can weasel out of paying for services rendered. As the customer, I should not have to remind, nor dispute with someone working in a profession handling personal and professional finances what policies of their boss's do or do not exist.  \n\nIf 'M' is overwhelmed, it is not my problem.  But to go so far  threaten clients when they do not submit to YOUR demands speaks volumes about a total lack of professional integrity.  There should be no doubt on the customer end that sensitive information is being handled respectfully regardless of any misunderstandings.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1650314679.0},{"title":"Big orange box of FAIL","author":"_mughi_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/u6dwwl\/big_orange_box_of_fail\/","text":"So, I recently ordered a pressure washer from the big orange store.  It showed up, and I opened it the next day.  Having noticed the package was a bit bashed (thanks failex), I looked it over for hidden damage.  I didn't have to look very hard, the output connection was bashed and nearly broken off.  Whatever, it happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remembered from when I was ordering it that I could also have picked it up in the store, but I didn't want to have to carry it around, and had it shipped instead.  So I called the store and asked if I could exchange it.  They said sure, they have 5 in stock, come to returns and swap it out.  I get to the store, drop off the damaged one and they tell me to go find a new one.\u00a0 Spent 10+ mins looking in the pressure washer section, can't find that model.\u00a0 Finally find someone to ask and they tell me it's prolly in the front w\/ a bunch of pre-assembled ones  I go to that section and find TWO of the model I have, wheel it back to returns and have them start the exchange.\n\nThey appear to be training someone because one lady is using the register and the other is telling her what she needs to do.  First they scan the one I'm returning and they decide it doesn't match the one they have, even though the only difference is the price.\u00a0 She tells the trainee to refund mine, and I'll just need to pay for the one in-store.  Mildly annoying, but not surprising or even that big of a deal.  Once the refund is processed, the trainee gives me the receipt for the return, and the other lady helps her enter in the information for the new one (no barcode on the tag for some reason).  She then tells the trainee,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OK, he owes you $410\".\n\nMe:  Um.. No.  I do not.  You just refunded me $278 for the same thing.\n\nHer:  Well, this one is $379 before tax.  It's a different item.\n\nMe:  No, it's the same item, it's apparently on sale online, and you haven't added my military discount yet.\n\nHer:  Well, this one is $379.  If you want the online price, you'll have to go over to the other desk and have them order it for you.\n\nMe: ... fine.. whatever\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI go over to the other desk, explain there is some sort of confusion\/mix-up and that apparently I need to order this online since I can't do an exchange.  Lady at the orders desk tells me she can't add two discounts, (maybe I explained it incorrectly and she thought the online sale was some sort of coupon or something I had), and that I should try ordering it from home like I did the first time.  At this point, I'd been there for close to 30 mins, didn't really want a floor model\/pre-assembled one anyhow, and didn't feel like arguing with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went home, pulled up the previous order, hit 'buy again', and got the same price..   Free shipping, or PICK UP IN STORE from the 5 they have IN STOCK.  I picked shipping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWas really tempted to choose pickup and go back and leave w\/ the one I had been dragging around, but that would have required another drive.

Unfortunately, pickup is probably a THIRD desk, and the irony would be lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  To be fair, it's not likely to be the employees' fault.  They get training in a specific way to do things and the computer locks things down, further limiting their options.

Girl at the register looks at me and we have this conversation:\n\n>Girl: **What would you like to order?**  \n>  \n>Me: I'd like to get the rolled tacos.  \n>  \n>Girl: **Actually, we're closed.**  \n>  \n>Me: What? *(I'm super confused.  I mean, I can understand that they're closed, because there was no one at all in sight, when I walked in, and it's kinda sorta late at night, but if they're closed, why aren't the doors locked and the lights off, and why ask me what I want to order if you're closed???)*  \n>  \n>Girl *(while looking at me like I'm stupid)*: **We. Are. Closed.**\n\nI'm struggling with how to respond.  I'm contemplating just walking away and going to the pizza place all the way on the other side of the shopping center.  I'm not sure how I'll balance a pizza box with my splinted finger walking past half a dozen stores, but, at least they're food.  At this point another employee comes in from outside.\n\n>Girl *(looking at the other employee)*: **Mexican food is closed, right?**  \n>  \n>Other Employee: No, it's fine.  \n>  \n>Girl: **Oh, fine.** *(then looking at me like it's all my fault)*, **So you wanted the rolled tacos?**\n\nI finish placing my order, and after a few minutes of waiting for them to finish preparing it, a third employee magically appears from the back, and starts cooking some food.\n\nI left, feeling like it was the most surreal fast food experience I'd ever had.  Where were all the employees when I first got there?  Why did more and more of them slowly appear as time went on?  Where did all of them come from?  And why, of all things, make the customer feel like they're an idiot, by saying \"We're closed,\" instead of saying \"Oh, we've stopped making Mexican food for the night, but you can still buy a hamburger\"?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1649996691.0},{"title":"How my doctor almost killed me.","author":"markedforpie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/u33zua\/how_my_doctor_almost_killed_me\/","text":"This year my family moved to a new city and I had to find a new family physician.  I got in touch with the local hospital and they suggested a family physician who works with their clients.  I called and made appointments for the whole family to get physicals.  Everything went fine for several months.  Until I became sick about a month ago.  I knew I had an ear infection as I am prone to them.  I went to the doctor and he said there was nothing wrong and told me to just use some over the counter nasal spray.  Um ok?  I guess you are the doctor.  So I did as instructed and purchased nasal spray and used it for a couple weeks. \n\nA little over a week later my sinuses were hurting and I lost my voice.  I returned to the doctor and told him that I now have a sinus infection and a double ear infection because both ears are hurting.  He told me that I just needed to use my nasal spray and get some over the counter ear drops.   Once again I listened and a little over a week later I could no longer stand the pain.  I was using the drops, nasal spray, DayQuil,NyQuil, and ibuprofen just to get through the day.  I returned to my doctor and BEGGED him to do something!  He prescribed $300 steroid ear drops.  \n\nThen a few days later I began having trouble breathing and I began coughing up thick dark green and brown mucus.  It got so bad I couldn\u2019t sleep in bed and I started keeping track of how many times I woke up coughing up mucus.  Btw it was 26 times in 8 hours.  After suffering through the weekend I got an appointment first thing Monday morning.  I came in with a fever of 103.3 a hacking cough, leaking ears, stuffed sinuses, body aches, chills, chest pain, a migraine from hell, shortness of breath and no voice.  My doctor tells me he is going to test for the flu and Covid.  Then he prescribed some cough medicine and sent me on my way when the tests came back negative.  I suffered all day Monday and Tuesday when my husband had enough and scheduled an appointment with a different doctor today.  \n\nI arrived and after all the preliminary testing she listened to my lungs and sent me for an X-ray. Then about an hour and a half later she called me and told me that I have a severe case of pneumonia and she had already called in a prescription for me for antibiotics, steroids and an inhaler.  I was to pick it up and take it immediately and if I was not significantly better by tomorrow afternoon I was to go to the emergency room to have IV antibiotics.  \n\nNeedless to say I did as she prescribed and while I\u2019m definitely not \u2018all better\u2019 I\u2019m not feeling like I can\u2019t breathe and going to die anymore.  \n\nTl;dr; doctor doesn\u2019t like to listen and lets an ear infection turn into full blown pneumonia.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1649894071.0},{"title":"A Customer Service Agent Yelled At Me","author":"ShotCurrency4020","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/u1tkbo\/a_customer_service_agent_yelled_at_me\/","text":"So I got a referral from my doctor to this imaging center for a renal ultrasound (to look at my kidneys and adrenal glands).

Every year I take them to get their vaccinations; Rabies and FVCRP. Been doing this for years (since before FVCRP was offered locally). Their previous vet (henceforth known as PV) would do low cost clinic days when anyone could bring in any animal for a rabies shot and they offered other shots for cats and dogs. For *years* the strategy was go to the clinic, tell the vet what shot(s) your pet (or neighborhood stray; there's a couple of animal groups that round up feral dogs and cats and take them to the low cost clinic days to get them vaccinated) was getting, go up to the cashier's table, tell them what shots your pets (or strays) were getting, and then pay for the shots. In, done, out. Whole process never took more than thirty minutes (which is good, because two of my cats start getting self violent if they're in the carriers for too long--and no, my carriers are *not* too small). For *years* this was the procedure. \n\nThe plague changed this. First of all, there was no low cost clinic in 2020. Had to actually make an appointment (thank heavens for pet stores with vets attached) and had to do them one at a time instead of getting them all in one go, because of restrictions (apparently cats can catch and carry Covid?). So, of course I was excited in 2021 when the low cost clinic day was brought back. I, personally, couldn't take them, since I was working that day, but I had family take them for me. First of all, there were overhead shelters set up and only one human and up to two animals were allowed per shelter. Fine, there were two people there and only four cats, doable. Then they had to wait almost an hour for the vet to even get to them and when the vet did, the vet *took the cats*. And held them. For several hours. (Not minutes: *hours*. And PV knew damn well how my cats react to being crated for too long, because I've discussed this with them before.) And *then*, after several hours, presented bills to my family members.\n\nI had given them money to cover the cost of the shots. I had given them *more* money than was needed, because sometimes the price varies by two to three dollars per shot. And both family members told them the cats were there for their annual shots.\n\nWell. Apparently, since I didn't get the cats their shots through PV (which had been *closed*) the previous year, that meant they got a \"mandatory\" health exam. Which was an extra $95 dollars. Per *cat*. Plus an extra fee because, like mentioned, two of my cats can't be crated for long periods of time. So, they reacted poorly. And there was an addition $30 fee, because those two cats were bleeding by the time of their mandatory exam. And threatened to confiscate the cats if my family couldn't pay right then. (Luckily my family spotted me the money. And even then, it took an additional couple of hours to get them back. (For context, family arrived for the clinic at 7:30 in the morning and didn't get out until nearly six at night.) The cats were traumatized, the humans were traumatized, and felt fleeced.\n\nI. Was. Livid.\n\nI called them up and demanded to know what they were thinking, keeping my cats crated for so long when they know two of my cats respond poorly to be being crated for so long, and what is up with this mandatory exam, and why they didn't tell anyone about it? They said I should have known policies would change with the plague and that the cats didn't have records of their shots for the previous year (1, they *did* have records for their shots the year before and would have had them with them if I'd known they were needed and 2, *they never fucking asked for the records in the first place*), and we should have been prepared for that. Then, and *then*, as if it wasn't bad enough, the person I spoke with on the phone said I should have *all* my cats declawed since two of them can't be trusted to have claws.\n\nThis year New Vet was doing a low cost clinic. Went in, told the vet what shots the cats were getting, went up to the cashier to pay. Was in and out in less than half an hour. Was back home in a little over an hour and a half.

Also, not being able to see the screen well, I've wasted time by having to ask to verify a discount was applied. It also doesn't help that I feel rushed and somewhat confused at times, trying to make sure I have the right payment cards out and ready. Doesn't help either, that I don't always know if my bf showed off his store discount card. I know it shouldn't get me flustered, but sometimes I just can't help it.\n\nI'm also rather independant. I like to do things by myself, with little to no help. But at home, I end up sitting in front of my computer, overwhelmed by all the things that need to be done around the house. I'm disabled, and spend a decent amount of time at the hospital. Coming home, I usually have some kind of restriction, which makes it difficult to get more than a few simple things done. Therefore, going to the grocery store and using the self-checkout gives me a sense of independence, and even pride. I've managed to accomplish something, without needing help! YAY!\n\nMy bf hates the self-checkout. So I don't get to use them very often anymore. But I'm not wanting to use them because I want to put someone out of a job. I don't want to use them so that I can harass an associate for not being fast enough to respond to me. I just prefer them because I can take care of it myself, and I like the feeling it gives me. It's a silly thing, but something that I will probably always secretly prefer, no matter how others might view it.\n\nEdited: I wrote this post to give people an understanding of ways they can benefit from self-checkouts. As well as try to dispel the idea of using them means people will lost their jobs. Yes, some stores will reduce their front facing staff (cashiers), but they will have to offset it by needing more staff to maintain the equipment, more than likely. And honestly, companies are going to try to reduce staff anyway, whether they go to a self-checkout, or not.\n\nHowever, I was really surprised at the number of people responding, as well as upvoting and just viewing this post. It makes me feel good, because I know it's been a controversy for a while. It's nice to know that I can provide some insight into why a person might use a self-checkout, even when there's plenty of cashiers to take their purchases.\n\nThanks to everyone for responding with your own comments, they help make the community better.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1648982661.0},{"title":"Are grocery store baggers not trained how to bag groceries anymore?","author":"nondescriptadjective","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tuu9b3\/are_grocery_store_baggers_not_trained_how_to_bag\/","text":"It always seems bad, and I don't want to be the ass who tells the bagger to let me bag my own groceries.

My mom wanted to replace a lot of the light bulbs in the house with LED bulbs. The problem was that there were so many different kinds of LED bulbs to choose from. Different shapes, sizes, colors, etc. For those of you who have never replaced a regular incandescent light bulb with an LED, they can produce a lot more light using a lot less wattage. On the packaging for LED bulbs, it will often say they have a brightness equivalent of, say, a 60-watt incandescent light bulb, but they actually only use around 10 watts. Or something like that (I don't know the specifics).\n\nMom wanted me to get two 60-watt equivalent LEDs and two 100-watt equivalent LEDs. I spent a lot of time looking at all the various options. If I found a 60-watt equivalent LED, I couldn't find a 100-watt equivalent LED of that same size. I called my mom and tried to describe what they had. She told me to go to where they had the regular incandescent bulbs, look at how big they are, and then find LED bulbs that are the same size. But the thing is, they didn't really have very many incandescent bulbs, because they are being phased out. I ended up flagging down a sales associate, and he said they don't carry incandescent light bulbs for most light fixtures anymore, but they might sell them at the dollar store.\n\nFinally after a long time of looking and getting very confused and frustrated, I picked out two 60-watt equivalent LEDs of one size, and two 100-watt equivalent LEDs of a different size. I went to the register and paid for everything, then went back to the house and tried installing them. But, when I opened one of the boxes, it was empty!\n\nWe can only assume that some thief opened the box, swiped the bulb, and left the empty box on the shelf. Kind of easy to do considering the fact that none of the boxes had seals on them that one would have to cut to open the box. We figured that if we took the empty box back to the store and explained what happened, they'd probably just assume we were trying to scam them and it would be difficult to prove otherwise. So we basically dumped our money down the drain.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1648876771.0},{"title":"Rideshare app driver swerves into oncoming traffic, might have been intoxicated.","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/ttel91\/rideshare_app_driver_swerves_into_oncoming\/","text":"I'd say about 98% of my experiences with drivers are normal, easygoing and not really that interesting to talk about.

On the map inside the app, she was sitting on the same street for several minutes before she finally started driving again (This wasn't like that glitch when the car on the map suddenly catches up, she truly was just sitting there). I don't know what was happening with that.\n\nThere's a feature on the app that you tap on, and it changes your phone's screen to a certain color so the driver can recognize you. Apparently your color and the driver's color are supposed to match. I'm standing there holding my phone up and she sees me, but drives right by.\n\nI texted her that she drove by me. She turns around and comes back. I get in the car. We take off. Things are fine at first.\n\nShe is following the map route most drivers use when driving me to work. It's a fairly busy road, and that's relevant to what happened next. She starts swerving, a lot. Four times she swerved into the oncoming lane and nearly missed hitting two cars. One of those cars hit their brakes and stopped.\n\nSo I said to her, \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\nShe goes, \"Huh? What?\" Like as if she was completely unaware of what she was doing.\n\nSo I say, \"Pull over and let me out.\"\n\nI don't remember exactly what she said, she was trying to argue with me about letting me out and I said to her, \"Let me out or I call the police.\" She pulled over after shouting \"Okay fine whatever!\" and I got out of the car. (I know about the app's silent safety alert feature, I had it ready too if she wasn't gonna let me out of the car).\n\nImmediately reported her through the app. I ordered a new ride and was picked up by a different driver a few minutes later who was much, much better. I got to work a few minutes late but I called my boss before I got there to explain what happened and she was very understanding. The driver who picked me up couldn't believe it when I explained what happened. He was really upset on my behalf.\n\nIn case anyone asks, there was nothing on or in the road to cause that swerving. The road was in fairly good condition, it was clean of debris. I think she was on something.\n\nA representative from the app wrote to me this morning to apologize for what happened, and also to say they refunded my fare.\n\nThis experience really made me rethink using the app. Even though most of my experiences are really good, this was pretty scary.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1648775243.0},{"title":"vent about being on hold","author":"glass_star","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tt0v10\/vent_about_being_on_hold\/","text":"I just was calling a service to make a payment because their website wasn't allowing me to and they have one of those repeating audio messages embedded in the hold music that say \"thank you for holding, someone will be with you shortly\" or whatever but every time they play that audio the music pauses and it sounds like someone is picking up the line. it plays approximately every 30 seconds and i keep stupidly getting my hopes up that I am about to speak to a real human but it never is.\n\nI finally get in touch with a human and they tell me to call back in 30 minutes because they don't have anyone in right now to can do what I need.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1648736549.0},{"title":"Giving a helping finger?","author":"awhq","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tspshh\/giving_a_helping_finger\/","text":"I know I just posted yesterday, but we're on a road trip, so we've been eating out a lot.\n\nToday at the burger place, we went in and placed our order.  The cashier made us repeat everything three times.  No worries.  Some people process a little slower than others and he really did seem to want to get our order right.  It was a burger meal and another burger with no tomatoes, no lettuce, with two pieces of bacon.\n\nOur order comes out and we take it to our car to eat.  I pull out one burger and open it to see if it was my husband's bacon burger.  It was not.  I pull out the other burger and notice two stickers on the wrapper.  One said \"Tomatoes\" and one said \"Ketchup\".\n\nThat's not right, I thought.  So I opened it and looked.  It had tomatoes, lettuce and ketchup.  It did not have bacon.\n\nI took it back in with my receipt.

I can't actually see them making the new burger, but I wait there anyway.\n\nWhile I'm waiting, I notice a woman standing next to a guy dressing burgers.  It appears she is training him, but not very enthusiastically.  He wraps up one burger he is working on and she points at the rolls of stickers next to him.  He ignores her.  She takes a sticker off the roll and holds it out to him.

He doesn't even look at her, but I know he saw what she was doing.. He didn't take the sticker.\n\nShe jabs her middle finger containing the sticker at him.  He still ignores her.  Then I see her speak to him, but I can't hear what she said.  He then takes the sticker, applies it to the burger wrapper and moves on to the next burger.  She does the exact same thing with the next sticker.\n\nJust then, the girl who was delivering orders to customers at their tables walks past me saying \"Those people at that table over there say their order is wrong but I don't know what's wrong with it.\"  She then proceeds to walk further into the back.\n\nI hear the middle finger woman say to her \"You better get out there and find out.  Don't come back until you know.\"\n\nJust then, my new burger came out.  I checked it to be sure it was right and left.\n\nI don't know if I felt sorrier for the trainee, the food delivery girl or the trainer.  Everyone seemed pretty miserable.\n\nI worked at the same kind of burger place in high school and college.  I had a real asshole for a boss.

A few minutes later she was cleaning up and my hands were sealed in wax and she started wiping off the table and accidentally caught my watch and it flew off the table and hit the floor a few feet away.  She apologized and walked over and picked it up.  When she picked it up her eyes widened slightly and she ran a finger over the face.  She then brought it back and laid it face side down on the table.  She turned to the lady who was working on my friend and spoke in another language and touched her wrist. I asked if everything was okay and she said \u201cOh yes it\u2019s fine! I was telling her that it was your watch that fell off the table. I\u2019m so sorry I knocked it off!\u201d  Because my hands were still covered in wax and plastic bags and I trusted her I said it was okay I understood it was an accident and we went on with our mani\/pedis.  \n\nOnce my pedicure was finished she left me in the hand wax until the other lady finished my friend\u2019s mani\/pedi.

One of my first trips a few weeks back was to a local \"Infront\" steakhouse for an early mid-week lunch at the bar.\n\nI love Infront's coconut shrimp and I haven't had it for two years because I wasn't eating in restaurants and it's not the kind of meal that travels well for carryout.\n\nI was the first lunch customer there for the day at 11:30. The bartender told me his name was Dan and he hooked me up: shrimp, loaded baked potato and a tall ice cold beer. Oh, and the brown bread with butter, too. Yum!\n\nWhen I got my check I was surprised it was only $17 something. The shrimp appetizer is $12.99 on Infront's website menu and the baked potato was $3.99. I paid without thinking, left a generous tip because it was much cheaper than I thought it would be, and left. Later I guessed Dan must have not charged me for the beer.\n\nWell, today I couldn't get those shrimp out of my mind so I went again, this time for a late lunch around 2.\n\nSame order, and I enjoyed it immensely again this time. Put my card down to pay and Dan says, \"I remember you from last time. I'm only going to charge you for the regular sized beer,\" with a grin.\n\nI got my check and I was floored to see it was only $15 something this time!

It's what I'd call a good relationship: my phone worked and I never had too much reason to call them, which is my favorite type of customer relationship really. \n\nWhen I get new phones, I buy unlocked ones so I can get what I want for the price I want and also use prepaid Sim cards when I travel overseas.  When I get a new phone,  I then take them to the BCS&P store and have them do the transfer.   Cool, hasn't been an issue across 4 or 5 phones over the years. \n\nFast forward to my most recent phone.  It is a \"S-Phone\" s21 upgrade from a s9.  I do the transfer in January, phone works, I'm good. \n\nThen last week I'm on a road trip.... and realize I can't make any calls. Anytime calls me,  it goes straight to voice-mail.  If I try make a call it 1) 90% of the time hangs up or 2) 10% of the time is silent for a bit then finally pops up a message that the Sim card isn't registered to any company.  I can't even call voice-mail to pick up the voice-mails.  How odd!  Because the thing is: my Sim card clearly IS registered to a company...I can still use text and data.\n\nSo I call BCS&P using my traveling companions phone, make it through the unhelpful voice menu and wait on hold 15 minutes.  They tell me the issue is they're upgrading to 5G only and dropping 3G service and that my s9 won't support that. \n\nWait a minute...I don't have an s9!  I have an s21.\n\nCompany person argues with me that I must be mistaken.  Nope, nope I'm not.  I'm pretty certain about what I dropped $1000 on a few months ago.\n\nOkay,  they say...I must have an old Sim card. I'll need to get one that supports 5G.\n\nAlright,  that at least makes some sense. So, I go to a BCS&P store that evening on my vacation... only to find out that they can't do anything because the name on my account is misspelled and I can't provide an ID that matches it.\n\nThat is...odd.  Now I'm going to admit I never really checked,  but we've had this relationship a decade you know? And I've paid bills the whole time and they've been swapping my phones all along, so you'd think this might have come up before. I have a suspicion my name hasn't been misspelled the whole time,  but...OK, here we are. \n\nThe lady in the store takes pity on me and tells me how to go into their online account and signup and change my own name through that. Then I'll be able to come in tomorrow. \n\nCan I just also mention the website is bizarre.  It doesn't have BCS&P in the name.  Instead it's called something a bit like \"paymeonline.com\" and is just for prepaid customers.\n\nOk...\n\nI try to do set up my account there and fail because guess what..the billing zip code isn't my zip code.  So I call again and wait on hold again.  They help me change the billing zip code but still can't change my name for me. \n\nWell, I get into the account... only to find out that half the features aren't available because the website is under maintenance. \n\nOk.\n\nSo I try later and manage to get my name correct. I also correct a bunch of other wrong garbage i have no idea how it got put in.  Its all close to my info but just jumbled.  I also think to look for my account number... but can't find it anywhere.  Not on bills,  activity records, personal info,  etc.  Not there.  So oh well,  that seems minor.   Maybe it's my cellphone number since that's what I use to log in and that's the only number I can find?\n\nBack to the store...\n\nThis time they accept my ID and sell me a 5G Sim card.  But guess what? Because I'm a prepaid customer, they can't activate it. I have to call... again. \n\nSo...time to go get my friends phone.  Again. \n\nI call,  make to hold, wait again... then begins a 90 minute ordeal (did I mention I was on vacation?)\n\nWe activate the Sim card and register it to my actual device. They see it... but it still won't make calls.  So we start playing all sorts of games.  Restarts, resets, uninstalling things, reinstalling things,  changing settings,  boosting towers,  changing the plan even... nothing changes the fact that I can't make or receive calls. I get elevated. Same thing. The one thing I refuse to do is a factory reset because I don't have a way to back up my data... on VACATION.  \n\nFinally they say they'll elevate my ticket as high as possible and get back to me on my friends phone within 24 hours. \n\n26 hours later when I hear nothing,  I call them,  wait on hold and then ask if they have any solutions.  Nope, but they'll put me in touch with BCS&P \"S-Phone\" rep to see if they have anything.  S-Phone guy says he can't do a warranty because my phone was bought renewed but BCS&P can sell me a new BCS&P locked phone for a discount?  Yeah,  hell no.  I HAVE a (almost) new phone!  That I paid lots of money for!\n\nAfter that nonsense I want to test the theory that it's my phone so I called 911. (Yes I know,  sorry...)  The call rings through fine.   So I know my phone can in fact make calls just fine...\n\nMy husband meanwhile is at home.  He and I have been texting. He starts googling and runs into whole THREADS full of people that in the past few months have run into this with BCS&P.   It's all people with unlocked phones and all were affected by the 3G shut down.  A common thread is that BCS&P support will not acknowledge this issue,  yet there are dozens of reports of it on their own forum.\n\nA few have found work arounds like reactivating their Sim cards in BCS&P branded phones then swapping them back,  but anecdotally when you do that,  the problem can reoccur once a few days or weeks go by.  I don't have a BCS&P branded phone to do this with, nor do I want to hand this problem randomly keep happening again and again.  \n\nBut there is another solution most people have found that doesn't involve a new phone: get a new provider.  Sounds good!  BCS&P isn't exactly making me feel like I owe them a thing. \n\nSo once I get home,  I go to Pink Mobile Company (P-MobileCo) where husband has a plan to see if I can do a family plan with him (we had just kept our providers when we married because the family plan was basically a break even over our separate plans, so why mess with what's working?)\n\nThey let me know I'll need my account number from BCS&P and that no...it isn't my cellphone number.  Well...shit.  Remember days ago when I was thinking I should get that?\n\nSince it's close I go to BCS&P store and ask and that seems faster than waiting on hold AGAIN.  They can't tell me, I'll have to call.\n\nSo I call,  wait on hold,  etc.  I ask for my account number only to get bombarded with questions. The first of which is \"what is the purpose for which you're requesting your account number?\"  I get the person I'm talking to is reading a script but holy shit.  We all know why I need my account number. \n\nI respond \"Because I pay the bill every month and I have a right to have that information.\"\n\nThey see all my prior calls to support and ask if I want to talk to tech support instead. No...no I don't. Counting the disasterous 90 minute call plus all the other calls and store visits I've wasted hours of time on this.  I just want my account number I repeat,  several times.  Though I do agree after the call to try restarting my phone one last time,  because sure whatever. \n\nShe tells me to wait and that her system is slow loading. Ok...I use the time to query where I can find the account number online.  Answer: nowhere.  It's not there \"for security reasons.\"  She confirms calling them is the only way. \n\nFinally I get the number and reconfirm it several times because I'm not going through this hell again if I don't have to.\n\nI ask her if she can also text it to me.  Because through all these other calls they were able to send me test messages,  phone numbers for S-Phone and ticket numbers. No, she can't.  Because ofc.  She does say after I question this she can replace the phone number of my home store in my online account with this number so it'll look like a too long phone number but we'll actuallybe that account number.  I agree to that hoping she doesn't get in trouble. \n\nAnyway, husband along for the ride,  we go back to P-MobileCo store and ask for them to add my phone to their service with a new Sim card. \n\nThe only heart stopping moment is why he tries on my phone to make a call to a code which should give something called a \"transfer pin\".  Ofc it doesn't call out... because it can't on BCS&P.   He tells me that can be a different number than the account pin and without that no one can transfer my number...I'd be held hostage by BCS&P. FORTUNATELY the login pin on my account is the same because it goes through. \n\n10 minutes later the P-MobileCo calls my phone.  I call my husband's phone.  NO FACTORY RESET needed,  no anything else,  phone works perfectly. \n\nYep,  the online stories were right: BCS&P just is having a major issue with unlocked phones. \n\nAnd just to top things off I now have unlimited data which I didn't before and I asked him if he could tell me the account number with P-MobileCo.  Sure!  Could he show me where it is on the website? Sure!  Is it on every bill? Totally!  IMAGINE THAT!\n\nOne thing I will say: I'm going to make sure I keep that number and my new transfer pin handy... just in case.  I don't know when BCS&P went to the dark side but I never want to have a similar experience.   Everyone I dealt with with both companies was nice and I don't fault any of them.  But BCS&Ps practices (the account number thing plus the pestering when I asked for it) plus unwillingness to acknowledge issues (if this many people online are having this problem, they have to know their tower shut down is impacting unlocked phones) paired with trying to solve the issue by selling branded phones... yeah hell no. Just shady.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1647975782.0},{"title":"Big computer and gaming store screws me over","author":"Skilledyeeter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tkd0xz\/big_computer_and_gaming_store_screws_me_over\/","text":"Obligatory on mobile.

The store has since changed ownership, and the new owners always offer to help anyone load the bottles, regardless of your age and\/or sex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA while back I shared [the story](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/s1qdj0\/purchasing_a_toilet_should_not_be_this_difficult\/) of how a lazy sales associate at a certain home center insisted that I lift a toilet I was trying to buy off of a high shelf. Well I happen to have another story involving a salesman (in this case, the co-owner) of a different establishment insisting that I lift a heavy object myself. This story isn't nearly as insane as the other one, but I thought I'd share it anyway. I forget when this incident happened but it was several years ago before the pandemic, so no masks, social distancing, etc., were involved.\n\nSo, I am a regular customer at a store that sells bottled water and bottled water accessories (bottles of all sizes, water coolers, etc.). It's a very small establishment and there usually is only one person on staff unless they are really busy. If you're just getting water and not any accessories, it's mostly self-service. You load your empty water bottles onto a cart, go up to the cashier's desk and pay, and then wheel the cart to a large \"sink\" (for lack of a better word) with a bunch of faucets at the very back of the store. There is a window directly behind the sink with a view of their water-treatment system, so you can be sure you're getting the purest water possible. You fill the bottles yourself, then wheel the cart out to your car (they have reserved parking spots right outside the store that are \"loading zones\"), load them into the car (or whatever vehicle you're driving), then wheel the empty cart back inside the store.\n\nBack when this incident took place, the store was owned and operated by these two older guys. One of them was very nice, the other one was rather grumpy. These guys would always offer female customers assistance with lifting the bottles and loading them into their cars, but they assumed that men could handle the heavy lifting themselves, regardless of your age or physical condition.\n\nUsually I handled the lifting and loading myself (I usually only have one or two bottles), but on this particular day, I woke up with a tense muscle in my upper back and shoulder. It was so painful that it was very difficult for me to get into a comfortable position so that it wouldn't hurt. However, I needed to go get water, so I took one of my empty 5-gallon water bottles (I think it's 5-gallon; I'm bad with math but it's one of those large blue bottles that you'd put on a water-cooler) and drove to the store; the pain in my shoulder making it difficult to drive. Thankfully the store isn't very far from where I live. And of course, Grumpy Owner (GO) happened to be on staff that day.\n\nI put my empty bottle onto the cart, pay GO, and then take the cart to the back and fill it with water. When it was all filled I put the heavy bottle back on the cart, which made my back hurt even more, then turned to GO and asked for assistance with loading it into my car, which led to the following exchange.\n\nMe: Could I please get some help loading this bottle? My back is hurting.\n\nGO: Can't you do that yourself? You're a young, able-bodied guy. I've seen you here before and you seem to be able to load it just fine, and I just watched you put the bottle back on the cart.\n\nMe: I know, but as I already told you, my back is hurting!\n\nGO: You only have one bottle! It's not that difficult to load one bottle into a car! I'm much older than you and I load bottles all the time! Most guys have no trouble loading bottles!\n\nMe: I understand, but my back hurts, and lifting it onto the cart just made it worse. It was difficult for me to drive here just now.\n\nGO: Well then maybe you shouldn't be driving!\n\nMe: I don't live that far away, and I needed to get water. I could really use some help loading this bottle into my car. Please!\n\nGO grunts, gets up from behind the desk, grabs the cart and wheels it outside to my car. I unlock the car.\n\nGO: Well, where do you want it? Front or back?\n\nMe: In the back, please.\n\nWithout asking me which side of the car I want it, GO wheels the cart to the opposite side of the car from where I usually put it (I usually have it behind the driver's seat), opens the door, and plonks it on the floor of the car.\n\nGO: Do you live alone? If so, you're still going to have to get the bottle out of the car yourself. Have a nice day!\n\nHe takes the cart back inside. I somehow summon the strength to lift the bottle onto the seat, fasten the seatbelt to strap it in, then, with my back hurting more than ever, drive home and park my car in the garage. I don't remember how I got the bottle out of my car and into the house, but I'm pretty sure I waited until I felt better.\n\nThis was several years ago. Since then, both GO and the other, much nicer owner retired. They both retired at the same time, and, oddly enough, one of them (I forget who it was) retired because he had back surgery and was no longer able to lift the bottles. The business was sold, and the new owner is a guy who is much closer to me in age, and he and his employees (all of whom are also younger guys, as well as a couple of women, one of whom is the owner's wife) always ask if you need help loading the bottles, regardless of your age or sex. Some of them don't even bother asking; they just say \"I can get that for you\" and wheel the cart away before you have a chance to say no, lol! They were very helpful when I was recovering from injuries in a car accident and wasn't able to lift heavy objects and had to walk with a quad-cane. Fortunately I'm fully recovered, but I still appreciate the help.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1647916692.0},{"title":"Airline cancels my booking, which causes me to pay more to get to my destination","author":"KTB1962","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/timpwp\/airline_cancels_my_booking_which_causes_me_to_pay\/","text":"I just got back from a cruise last week and had an awesome time.

Booked it about 500 days out.  Booked airfare through the cruise line (got a GREAT deal) at about 300 days out.  Everything was hunky dory until the day before we were to fly out.\n\nOn to what happened.\n\nNow I\u2019m anal when it comes to vacations.  I check everything constantly just in case.  The Sunday before we were to fly out (which was on a Wednesday) I checked the app I had for the airline as well as their own site just to make sure everything was cool.  It showed me ticketed, I still had the seats I selected, etc.  I also checked the return flight, which was with the Friendly Skies and showed the same.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday morning.  Once again I check everything.  And my outgoing flight was gone.  I had no flight going out.  My booking was not there at all.  Panic mode!  I quickly checked my return flight and it was still there, so I only had to deal with one airline.\n\nI immediately got on the phone with the cruise line and used my wife\u2019s phone to call the airline.  Hold times were looooong\u2026 Thanks to a FB group, I was able to get a more direct line to the cruise line and, after being on hold initially for over an hour, I hung up and eventually called direct.  Got through in about 15 minutes.  But I get ahead of myself.\n\nMeanwhile, I had gotten through to the airline and I was told my booking was cancelled because it wasn\u2019t ticketed.  (Lie #1 as the cruise line showed it ticketed on their end.)  I immediately asked that they reinstate it as I had paperwork showing it was booked and paid for.  They said it was never paid.  (Lie # 2 because I had my billing statement and the cruise line\u2019s website showing it had been paid.)  After some back and forth they asked if I wasn\u2019t to rebook at a higher price.  I kindly told them to F off, and yes that\u2019s what I said, but I didn\u2019t say \u201cF\u201d\u2026  I hung up and this is when I tried calling the cruise line again with the direct number.\n\nAs I was on hold with the second call to the cruise line, I checked online to see if there were any flights available going out.  Thankfully there were some, but all were first class.  Having no choice, I went ahead and booked through the Friendly Skies and we were set.  I only did that because I had no idea how long the hold time would be and I wasn\u2019t going to take a chance of missing out on a flight.\n\nBy now I got through the cruise line, told them what happened, they verified what I already knew (I was ticketed, etc.), they contacted the airline, and were given the same line of BS.  To add insult to injury, the cruise line travel agent was apparently told that I was the one who cancelled the flight.  (Lie #3.)  In the end the cruise line refunded my money for \u201cA\u201d cancelling my booking.  Also, in talking with the cruise line travel agent, I discovered that this airline has a major problem for them lately.  Cancellations, changing the days of flights, etc., just a ton of headaches for them.\n\nIn the end, it all worked out, but it cost me a lot more.  The original flight, which was one-way, was $329 total for 2.  The first class tickets were $1,308 total.  We got to our destination, but it cost me a grand more\u2026.  I\u2019ll never fly \u201cA\u201d again.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1647787850.0},{"title":"\"friendly\" server that is just rude.","author":"CommieCarotte","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tilvpn\/friendly_server_that_is_just_rude\/","text":"There was this small restaurant near by that had such amazing food, I didn't mind the \"friendly\" service. \n\nBy friendly, I mean that the main server literally acts like a long time friend who's comfortable enough to be rude!

Also apologies for the length, but all the backstory is necessary so you understand my frustration with ChatChat, and why I decided to cancel early.\n\nTL;DR - ChatChat messes up at EVERY step of the process, from Internet speeds, to misinforming me about payment plans, to customer service. Maybe I was a Karen about it, but it's taken 2 months just to cancel properly, and have the rug pulled out from under me regarding their promises.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI was signed up for an 18 month contract with the company ChatChat. They promised 60-70mbps Internet, with a guarantee of AT LEAST 54mbps during high usage times. Fair enough, thats enough to get my streaming and gaming done, I accepted. This cost me around \u00a325 a month.\n\n3 months in, after checking my Internet speed at all times of the day (I'd switch between doing 8am and 3pm one day, to 10am to 8pm, to 12 noon and 11pm every day, and just pick a random one of the times listed each day), ensuring at least one of the times wasn't listed as a high usage time (they listed themselves that for my area, the high usage times are 8-11am and 8pm-10pm are their busiest times when I asked so I could keep checking). I was ONLY getting 54-56mbps at any point. So I queried it. They said it was above my guaranteed speed, but they agreed it wasn't what I originally signed up for, as it should be faster.\n\nThey tested all my equipment, and nothing was at fault, they just clearly couldn't provide the speeds advertised, only their lowest guarantee. I needed roughly 65mbps to play my games without lag or long loading times when playing online (like the game would load, but it'd lag when I moved, of NPCS wouldn't load in for a few minutes, or I'd have low frame rates (like below 30fps), and my streaming services would buffer a lot (ALL of them, not just one app, so I knew it was an Internet problem, as it happened across all my devices on all apps). So I asked customer services what I could do, and they basically gave me the answer of \"nothing except wait the contract out\". This was the highest speed contract I could get through ChatChat also, they didn't offer higher speeds for my area.\n\nWell, I decide to wait it out and deal with issues. Until there's 6 months left on my contract and Mergin Vidia offers a new customer contract of 108mbps (99 mbps guaranteed), plus TV packages of all my favourite crime channels that are difficult to find programs online, AND phone services that don't cost extra as its covered in the plan. All for \u00a337 a month. Thats obviously a no brainer - almost double my Internet speed guaranteed, tv channels i wanna watch, and home phone services so I can call around about my various appointments that eat into my minutes on my mobile phone plan? Sold.\n\nActually Cancelling:\n\nSo I ring up ChatChat and explain my situation. I've had numerous documented complaints with no resolution or explanation, only told to wait my contract out. I want to cancel as Mergin Vidia has a much better offer and I want to transfer there so I can actually use my Internet for streaming without buffering and play my favourite MMO's without excessive waiting, lag, and Internet issues (I did used to get kicked out of servers a LOT, which seems to be my Internet issue as well, but I didn't figure that out until after I switched and haven't been kicked out once). \n\nThe retention team for ChatChat kept me on the phone for half an hour trying to convince me to stay with them. I told them unless they can offer me the exact same things at a cheaper price, or a better deal at a cheaper price, I wasn't staying. I repeated this statement about 15 times in this half an hour. All they kept offering were more expensive or worse but cheaper plans. Eventually I had enough, as I was genuinely hoping they could offer me a better plan, and told them I need to cancel, as I WAS moving services, and I just need to sort out early termination fees. They told me it would be around \u00a390 to terminate, and I asked if I can split it up and make partial payments to clear the balance, as \u00a390 in one go is too expensive, but I can clear my balance in 2 payments of \u00a345. \n\nThe agent then transferred me to Billing and Payments department of ChatChat who confirmed they could absolutely do that  and to contact them after my final bill has been issued (this comes after disconnection of services, its important in a moment). I asked them to note it on my account, so I wouldn't be bitten in the arse later by other agents. She claimed she did (spoiler alert: she didnt). \n\nAny other time I had to call regarding disconnection, I confirmed this fact - I could make a payment plan after I'd cancelled, so I wouldn't have to stretch myself too thin. Around 5 different agents informed me of this.\n\n2 months pass, I've switched to Mergin Vidia and I'm waiting for my ChatChat final bill, as I have 30 days notice, then 30 days to receive my final bill. I receive it, I've received a credit for my overpayment on my last bill, so its down to \u00a380. Great! I can make 2 payments of \u00a340 instead of \u00a345, awesome! No. It was not awesome. \n\nI go onto their online chat as that day I had a headache and some speech processing problems so didn't want to call and spend twice as long as it would take on the online chat (its a known condition for me, and being treated, nothing to worry about, just explaining my actions here), and ask for a payment plan to be set up for 2 partial payments, or some way of splitting the bill like the helpful agents all agreed it could be over the last 2 months. The agent on the chat said this was not possible as my account has been disconnected. Cue groan here, as I had a bad feeling this would happen. So I explained the situation, and told them what the agents had said, what dates I spoke to them on, and then asked them to check the notes. Nothing there.\n\nOkay, not this agents fault, he was in the Collections department, and not his issue, so I asked to be transferred to someone higher up or the Billing and Payments department to see whats happened, and they were absolutely not in trouble, I just need to figure out the way to do it. They argued with me for about 50 minutes saying they couldn't transfer me because my account was disconnected and I absolutely couldn't be referred to someone higher up unless I had a problem, despite me just trying to clarify what help I needed and asking where I should be contacting to try sort anything out. I never got pissy until now, I channeled Karen energy a bit, and I said \"Well, i do have a problem now. Either you or the other agents have misinformed me, and you're being quite unhelpful, and a tad rude by not informing me of my options, or telling me how to get the help I need, just telling me I absolutely cannot do it the way I've been informed, despite me asking what I can do numerous times. Please transfer me to your supervisor so I can make a complaint and ask for the correct people to talk to.\"\n\nHe disconnected the chat, and I got a text message saying a complaint has been filed on my behalf and ill be contacted by ChatChat in 2 days. Fine, okay. I'll try the online chat again. This time I managed to get through to the actual Billings and Payments helpline, and they told me the same thing, it couldn't be done... but didn't argue the point over and over like the previous agent. After she said it couldn't be done, I said \"Okay, I accept that I was misinformed, is there something else I can do? Can you put a note on my account about why I'm paying in 2 payments, etc?\" (I had informed them the reason but its personal, mostly medical stuff, and I don't want to share here). She immediately sorted this out and informed me \"There'll be late fees, do you want to be transferred to someone who can help you out with those?\" Sure, if you can, that'd be awesome!\n\nThe guy I got transferred to sorted those out for me (I have to contact them if I get late fees, and there's a note on my account under his name saying they are to be waived immediately), and also made sure I had all the proof needed on my end to prove it, such as screenshots and emails of the conversation and a copy of the notes listed on my account from that day. \n\nI did speak to the complaints department and the most they had to say was \"We will make sure our agents remember to have correct information, sorry for the inconvenience\"... so they'll make a note somewhere and forget to mention it again I presume.\n\nI just hope i don't have to update this because ChatChat messed it up again -.-","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1647622680.0},{"title":"Pushing away a customer in an already deserted restaurant","author":"MervShmerv","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tgskt6\/pushing_away_a_customer_in_an_already_deserted\/","text":"This story is relayed from my dad, but from a trip the whole family was on. \n\nMy dad has a job where he travels a lot, interviewing people and writing reports.

I\u2019m disabled and can\u2019t drive, and get feee cabs through my insurance to use for work, school, etc. For shorter rides, I\u2019ll use my transit discount card to pay $2 and go to the grocery store or whatever, to save the tickets, since they\u2019re limited to a certain amount every year.\n2.

I have no idea why they did this, since they are constantly making mistakes and refusing to listen, and always have conflicting opinions on rules and regulations.\n4.

Everyone else is either out of business, or has been bought out by them so they can \u201cgrow their fleet.\u201d Any other transit company will charge me full price for their services, and thanks to inflation they are fucking expensive; and I am dirt poor and can\u2019t afford to spend $100 or more every week just to get around. The bus system is worse, and is extremely unsafe.\n5. The manager of the company refuses to assign me a specific driver. The fiend I usually rely on and I have set up a gog\u00f3s system where I\u2019ll call in my trips early, schedule them really late, and send it out when he picks me up so he is the first to see the order and accept it. I have written a more detailed post about this, which I may eventually post to r\/MaliciousCompliance, but I haven\u2019t decided if it\u2019s worthy enough yet. This is the most important piece of context, which will come into play later.\n\nSo, what happened? Well, tonight I had my weekly choir rehearsal at a local church from 7-9. My friend (let\u2019s call him Dylan) picked me up around 4:30 shortly after I got off work. I had a few stops to make on the way, so we ran those trips before I stopped at my house for a minute, then would go to church from there. The plan was to make one trip scheduled for 8:30 they would cover the ride there, then have an open return to get me home, meaning I would call the company when I was ready to go home later that night. This would be to make sure we didn\u2019t have any problems in case I was early or late to finish.\n\nBoy, was I wrong about that\u2026\n\nSo, I get to church and everything\u2019s going great. We get to our short break around 8:30 and have another four or five songs before we\u2019re done for the night, so it\u2019s looking like we\u2019ll get out on time. However, during my break, towards the back of the room, I hear someone call my name and ask \u201c.Hey OP, did you call a cab? There\u2019s one outside.\u201d I( or course am all like \u201cNooo\u2026\u201d because I hadn\u2019t asked them to come get me from the church yet. I pull out my phone, thinking my fiend may have decided to come early and Rut for me outside; but he didn\u2019t answer. So, that\u2019s when I called the company to find out what happened.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is where shit totally hits the fan.

Let me just confirm, I\u2019d your name OP?\nME: Yes ma\u2019am.\nDISPATCHER: Okay, yes, Mr. OP I see here your trip was sent out, but was not assigned to a specific driver.\nME: But what I\u2019m trying to figure out is if I asked for the trip to be an open return, why is there a cab outside?\nDISPATCHER: Well, your order was sent out but it wasn\u2019t sent to a specific driver, because it was bidded on.\nME: Okay, we\u2019ll I never asked for the trip to be released, because like I said I\u2019m not ready to go yet.

When I called around 3 or 3:30 earlier today, I specifically told the dispatcher I would like an open return, and I Agar called you guys to send out the trip or anything yet.\nDISPATCHER: We\u2019ll sir, I\u2019m showing here your order was sent out and accepted by a driver, and because it was marked as a \u201cno show,\u201d there is nothing we can do and we won\u2019t be sending you another one.\n\nWait\u2026 WHAT?!?!\n\nME: So, let me get this straight\u2026 you guys sent out a trip that I didn\u2019t ask to be released, a driver accepts it and Marie it as a \u201cnoe showw\u201d because I\u2019m not ready to leave yet, and you won\u2019t be sending me another cab?\nDISPATCHER: That\u2019s correct.\nME: Okay\u2026 can I talk to a supervisor, please?\nDISPATCHER: One moment\u2026\n\nSilence.\n\nCall disconnected.\n\nBy this point, I\u2019m starting to freak out because my fiend wouldn\u2019t tell me if it was him, implying that it wasn\u2019t, and they don\u2019t want to tell me what happened or admit they fucked up the order, and won\u2019t fix the trip and are now refusing service?!\n\nThis phone call obviously took way longer than I thought, so we had resumed our rehearsal and I totally missed my solo cue, so u walked back in to rejoin but tried texting Dylan to see what the fuck happens and if he was still going to pick me up. He didn\u2019t give me an answer so I was totally feeling our, and in no condition to keep singing, thinking I was basically stranded there, not knowing when or even if I would get home.\n\nBy the time rehearsal was over, I was going to get a ride from soemeone else, until Dylan faked me and told me he was outside, so I called my mother and helped her call the company and boom a trip to get me home on her account (she and I have the same type of account, and can book trips for herself without it impacting me at all. And since the company wasn\u2019t going to help me if I tried to fix it, this was the only other way to make sure Dylan got paid for his time.\n\nOn the way home, I told Dylan he needed to get the owner\/owner\u2019s son to figure out what the hell is going on. He told me out of all the clients he\u2019s helped out over the years, he\u2019s noticed that I\u2019m the only one that runs into so many problems, meaning they likely have some sort of vendetta faints me or something. He and I don\u2019t know why, but I told him I need to get to the bottom of this, because I don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nI have had a lot of problems with this company like this one, as mentioned in my post history. Every law firm I\u2019ve contacted has denied my case for whatever reason, and I don\u2019t know how else I can fix it, since absolutely no one will ever listen to my complaints. And the stupid company manager doesn\u2019t give a shit about me anymore. I know for a fact that if Dylan wasn\u2019t as nice as he was, or as able to help me out, I likely would\u2019ve been fucked tonight and probably would be wiring this as I slept on one of rh pews in the church.\n\nIf anybody has any suggestions on what I should do, please tell me. I\u2019m going to go scream my head off in the bathroom, try and calm down, listen to some YouTube (hi Jack, Zach, and Yugo), take a shower, and go to bed.

It's very fresh fish, and a few times a year I order a family size to take home. One day, I placed the order and shopped for my other groceries while it cooked. I returned to the counter to see one young twenties\/teen girl leaning up against the counter chatting with another girl her age who was shopping with her infant daughter. I was waiting patiently when I noticed my fish, still in the frying basket hanging over the fryolator. Now, I'm a former restaurant manager, and I know that if you leave food over the hot oil, the food will absorb the oil and be greasy. I waited a few more moments to see if the girl would stop chatting. Nope. I had been waiting about two minutes by now\u2014not a long time unless you're waiting!\u2014and no return eye contact, so I interrupted their conversation. \"Excuse Me! I hope that's not my fish hanging over the fryolator!\" the girl had a kind of condescending tone. \"Your fish needs to rest after it's been fried or it will get soggy.\" \n\nI replied \"I know that. But If you leave the fish there, it will get greasy. That's why you have heat lamps.\"\n\nI did get my food, with no more words or eye contact. \n\nI was left feeling that I was in the wrong. This bothered me a bit and I kept returning to it in the following days. Was I the Asshole? Was it a Gen Z\/ boomer thing? Am I a Karen? Do I want to go back?\n\nA few weeks later and it's Lent with lots of fish specials. I decide to go to the same market and thought I might get a fish dinner, but had to suss the place out first.

I am not currently a server but was in my younger years. My friend who was with me was also a server in her younger years, including as a cocktail waitress at a topless bar so she takes zero bullshit. We are now both middle-aged women. \n\nShe came into town and we went to eat brunch\/lunch at a cafe near her rental. The place was a smallish cafe with great reviews. We sat outside and were eventually greeted by our young male server (late teens-early 20s). Things started off okay and we got through most of the meal before the big problems started. I say big because already we had inconsistent service from him but it wasn\u2019t enough to complain about or affect tips. It definitely helped that the food was excellent. \n\nSo it comes to the end and before I can say something the server dropped a dirty napkin on top of my food and removed my plate without asking me if I was finished. I did not have my silverware in a \u201cfinished\u201d position either. Luckily I was pretty much done & was only picking at it, but still I felt a bit irritated. I thought about it & decided that everyone makes mistakes and I really only need to decide whether I\u2019m going to mention what he did (to him) to ensure that he doesn\u2019t do it to future customers. \n\nWe request the checks and my companion pays for both bills in cash. The change would have been $8.92, which my friend wanted because she wanted the small bills for future tips & she was planning to switch that cash with a bigger cash tip (wanted to give him a $10 I think) once she got the envelope back. Well, he never brought the change but he hadn\u2019t said goodbye or anything so after 20 minutes my friend gets up to go look for him so she can get her change. My friend was convinced that he had assumed the $ was his (never asked) and so she had it in her mind to set him right, especially after the earlier goofs. \n\nAlso important to mention is that we are sitting outside and there are several full tables of mostly elderly regulars. There had been 2 different attempts by visitors to sit at a table to be served but were never helped. One straight up left and the other guy did too, but came back a minute later because he was a regular who wanted his regular order. (I get it, food was so good). My friend returned to the table & the waiter arrived at the table shortly after. My friend inquired after her change, and the server starts sputtering and speaking half-sentences, and just generally uncomfortably fumbling around; at one point he tried to say something about not having the right change but then can\u2019t elaborate; then it was something about bringing her $5 or something like that because reasons and at this point all of the tables are listening and some are participating, trying to get the server to understand the simple request that my friend wants the change that is due to her, period. (And no, no language barrier). The one clear thing he did say was \u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted it! I didn\u2019t know you wanted your change!\u201d C\u2019mon man. \n\nHe then starts lying to counter her criticism  (\u201cI was watching out here,\u201d, \u201cit wasn\u2019t 20 minutes\u201d, etc) so she takes the opportunity to point out the elderly regular who started to leave but didn\u2019t. Elderly dude agrees. Rest of porch is now kinda yelling at the waiter because no one is really this obtuse, right?  My friend finally has enough of him and as she stood up to go inside to talk to the manager this kid flips out, puffs out his chest,  and goes completely aggro like he\u2019s going to fight my friend. \u201cWhaddya gonna do? Huh? Huh? Where are you going? Whatchu gonna do?\u201d as he\u2019s getting into fighting mode (putting thing in his apron so his hands were free, balling his fists up, etc). My friend, who is pretty unflappable, looked at him like he was an idiot and said \u201cI\u2019m going to see the manager, what is wrong with you?\u201d The elderlies are now making loud noises to indicate their shock & disapproval noises (at the waiter), and so he wisely chooses to follow my friend inside. \n\nWhile she is inside the owner comes outside (male) to address the elderly man who had left but returned. I think it was right about this time that I learned that the owner is the waiter\u2019s dad and manager is probably mom to this horribly-acting kid, and the dad\u2019s weak attempts to excuse his kid\u2019s behavior did not go well with the crowd. (\u201cIt\u2019s busy\u201d will never excuse your son trying to fight a middle-aged woman, sorry). Owner ducks back inside once he basically got booed by the elderlies. A woman at another table starts talking to me and mentions she thinks the waiter has ADHD but usually they still enjoy their visits. \n\nWaiter then comes outside, points at me (who has been nothing but nice and hasn\u2019t even looked at him since the disagreement began because honestly I was trying not to laugh at the absurdity of his attempts at explanation), and issues me a vague threat about \u201cbeing in big trouble something something police\u201d, to which I just stared hard at him, followed by slowly saying \u201cdude, I haven\u2019t said shit to you. Stop.\u201d He jawed a bit more then went back inside. My friend came out the door with her cash & we left, waiter trailing after her & yelling something ridiculous after us. \n\nApparently waiter\u2019s mom chewed him a new one inside the store so at least someone has some sense. I\u2019d go back if the kid wasn\u2019t\u2019 there but given dad\u2019s reaction I doubt I\u2019ll have the opportunity. Shame, because the food was damn good.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1647214993.0},{"title":"The closest I\u2019ve been to crime","author":"bellybuttonthraway","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/td67l1\/the_closest_ive_been_to_crime\/","text":"I\u2019m currently out of town with my mother for a family members death.

Short background:\n\nAbout 4 years ago I started wearing Hawaiian shirts to work on Friday as a sort of malicious compliance to a new dress code policy.\n\nAbout 3 years ago I was in a coffee shop near work on a Friday and the cashier asked me if I wanted a free donut.  He points out a sign I had never noticed: \"Wear a Hawaiian shirt on Friday and get a free donut with the purchase of any coffee!\"  Sweet.\n\nJust before the pandemic I stopped by and got a coffee and my free donut on a Friday and the cashier snorted derisively and rolled her eyes at me.  At times I can be a bit gregarious so I asked her what the problem was and after a bit of coaxing...well, she vented some pent up rage.\n\nApparently she feels very strongly that anyone who comes in wearing a Hawaiian shirt on a Friday and asks for the free donut is taking unfair advantage over all the other customers who aren't wearing said shirts.  She hates the company policy and wants them to get rid of it completely or make it a free donut for anyone who buys a coffee on Friday.\n\nI think the only reason she stopped yelling was because she realized that all her coworkers and all the customers had stopped what they were doing and were just staring at her.\n\nSo pandemic and the place is shut down for a while.  Re-opens as DT only and I start going back a couple of times a week, often on Fridays since why not.  It's been a couple of years but I still remember that woman and I don't see her so I figure she is gone.\n\nNope, she was at the DT today.

Usually they're okay.\n\nI placed my order and drive to the window.  Hand over my debit card.  I noticed he swiped my card a few times so I asked if there was a problem.  *No, it is just having trouble reading it and timing out.*\n\nAfter 5 swipes, he finally handed it back with the receipt.  I already had my bank app open to check for any pending charges and it was just the one, so we're good.  Or so I thought.\n\n5 minutes later, he came back and said they were having some technical difficulties, it would just be a few more minutes.  \n\n10 more minutes and a woman in a manager shirt came to the window and said their system just went down, it was going to be a few more minutes.\n\nMore cars came and all of them left without ordering.

I am calling them in about an hour when they open to ask for the store manager.  I don't want a refund or anything other than for them to know how bad her attitude was and how she handled the situation.\n\n\nSmall update:\nI called this morning right after they opened.  The GM was there.  She was already well aware of the situation because that's who the shift manager was yelling at last night.  According to her *the situation is already under investigation and appropriate action will be taken*.  I told the GM, as a shift manager myself, I understand being the only one available when things go really bad, but her attitude towards me, and not trying to fix the situation for me, as I had already paid and waiting, was unacceptable.  I understand her priority was to get the system back up and running, I've actually been in similar situations.  I just wanted them to be aware that the cashier at the drive thru handled things much better than the manager.  I was offered a refund and I declined.

I applied for my first credit card, which I knew was a mistake. The other mistake was to choose a certain big bank. Let's call it Wobbly Bank (I chucked a wobbly at them a few times). After a year of stupidly spending money on my credit card, I decided to eventually cancel this card. I slowly paid my credit card balance off until I had at least $2 remaining. I rang Wobbly Bank to cancel. They advised me to attend into my local branch to pay the remaining balance and cancel the card. I entered said branch, paid balance in cash then requested cancellation.\n\nEasy right? Nope, nope, nope\n\nI soon found out that receipts are important and corporations can suck. \n\nWell, 6 months later (without any communication from said bank), I received debt collector notice. Wtf?! I called said debt collector and explained that it had already been paid. Lady from debt collector said she would hold off debt letters while I try to resolve the issue with Wobbly Bank. Did she? No!\n\nI contacted customer service of said Wobbly Bank and advised them of what happened. They asked for a receipt. Oh crap. Why would I have a receipt after 6 months? I told them the branch and date I paid the balance. She advised me that she would investigate the matter.\n\nHeard nothing. Meanwhile, I kept receiving debt collector notices stating \"We have not heard from you\". Each and every time I received a notice, I called them and told them that they were supposed to have the case on hold until I resolved the issue with Wobbly Bank.\n\nAny conversations with Wobbly Bank or debt collector caused me to turn into a Karen whilst bringing me to tears. Not only were they not listening to me but were being completely incompetent. Debt collector kept stating that I should pay the money owed so the case could be closed. I yelled \"why should I pay an amount I already paid?\" It was the principle of it all. I am damn stubborn.\n\nCrying to my stepmom (rip lovely lady) about the predicament of my credit score being affected and no one listening, she calmed me down. \"What about sending them a Letter of Demand?\" she asked. She explained that legally they had to respond to a certain number of days dealing with my demand. \n\nWe wrote a letter, which included Wobbly Bank to investigate the situation in a timely manner and debt collector to change their policies to reflect flexibility in collecting debt. I demanded a letter of apology from both Wobbly Bank and debt collector for the stress they caused.\n\nBam! I received a letter of apology from debt collector with a note they had fired the lady looking after my case for her 'incompetence' plus a change in policies. \n\nI received a phone call from a branch manager at Wobbly Bank apologising for the stress. They had found a check they had written for the amount in the back of the safe!! He sent me a letter of apology along with movie tickets. He assured me that procedures would be put in place to prevent this situation.\n\nUnfortunately, this situation has caused me to get triggered when corporations become incompetent. I apologise to any customer service representative for going full Karen. Please listen to customers and give them great customer service. It helps a lot.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1646965369.0},{"title":"PearWasp's forbidden boneless buffet.","author":"Zbricer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tbcw9v\/pearwasps_forbidden_boneless_buffet\/","text":"Last year my little brother and i decided to try Boneless wings in as many places as we could, so that we may finally nest in one place (and depending on which sauce we want, we have a few stable options now).\n\nOne day he excitedly tells me that Pearwasp's had a boneless buffet, only applies on wednesdays and spans from 12 to 10 pm. We were both starving and since we would be able to try many different sauces, we went for it.\n\n\nTry 1:\n\nWe get to the lobby, it's only the two of us with no lne else in wait, a couple tables (literally two) are taken and the crew is walking around, nobody even looks our way for about 20 minutes. Tired of waiting i talk to the nearest waitress and ask if we can get a table, she takes us to a booth and says she'll be back with the menus (we hadn't even mentioned the buffet). 10 minutes happen and we don't see her anywhere, so i walk to another waiter that was chilling at the bar and ask for the menus, he gives them to me and says he'll tell the first waitress to swing by ASAP.\nI go back to our table, pick our drinks, apetizers and are ready to order, we saw the waitress at another table talking to the customers, no dishes or anything, just talking for 10 minutes. After that we honestly got mad and left, we couldn't even find the waiter that DID give us the menu. As we were leaving through the parking lot exit, the waitress runs over to us and tells us we shouldn't be using that door, at which point we didn't care and just left.\n\n\n\nTry 2: \n\nDifferent Pearwasp's, i was coming out of the movies with a friend and it, coincidentally, happened to be on a wednesday, i told him about Try 1 and said he'd actually like to try them as he loves boneless and hadn't eaten anything yet. \n\nSo we get in, get a waitress immediately, get seated quick, she takes our drink orders and then we mention we want the buffet.\n\nNot even exaggerating, and i hope my poor formatting doesn't make this confusing, but it went like this:\n\nW: Oh! The buffet? Nooooo.... Are you sure? Don't you want some chicken strips with salsa instead?\n\nMe: Uhm sounds good, but i want the buffet, i want to try the sauces.\n\nW: Well, you can ask for ADDITIONAL sauces if you ask for the chicken strips! Do i hear you want to try them?\n\nMe: Nope, i also want loads of chicken, so... Just the buffet please.\n\nW: Oh, so you want chicken!\n\nMe: yes.\n\nW: In that case we have the chicken burger! Yum! So you want a chicken burger and your friend will be having?\n\n-At this point i didn't even have a response, she seemed so uncomfortable and\/or hurt that i was battling between pity and anger-\n\nFriend: Yeah. He said buffet, and me too, i want tamarindo sauce please.\n\nW: Oh... So you both want to try the buffet? But that's not today it's only on-\n\nMe: Wednesdays, like today -i had to cut her off- the... Sign on the front says that.\n\nW: OH THE BONELESS CHICKEN BUFFET! -We realized it was louder so a manager could hear, he nodded when he heard It- yeah, coming right up!\n\n\nFrom there we asked for as much as we could just to see if there was anything odd in the chicken, aside from more bread every time, or more fries, the sauce was good, but still didn't like that they wanted to force us to order something different. If they are out of chicken or whatever, just tell us so, there's other things we like from there, but tell us. Anyway, since the food was good i wasn't as annoyed as i was last time, this made it so that during december, 2021 (All of these were during 2021), when my older brother came for the holidays with his gf, we wanted to take them out to eat, and so we picked PearWasp's as we saw an add on Facebook for one particular stablishment on the other side of town. Which i'll lable as:\n\n\nTry 3:\n\n\n It was on wednesday and it was an \"end of the year special, so send off the year properly\" with even more kinds of sauces and cauliflower boneless added to the menu. We were super excited and decided to go, a group of 5 which consisted of my two younger siblings, my older brother, his girlfriend and myself.\n\nWe get there 6 hours before the buffet ends as per the add. We got seated after about 10 minutes and we noticed they were busy, so we were patient. We got a corner table to accomodate everyone and got the menus, we ordered the drinks and then we uttered the unspeable talking words of apple, i mean pear doom:\n\n\nUs: we'd like the buffet, please, my brother and sister want these burgers and these and those drinks, please\n\nWaiter: -visibly nervous- the what? What buffet, we don't have one.\n\nMe: -honestly confused, as he behaved as if i asked to see his browser history- Uhm, the boneless chicken buffet.\n\n\nY.Brother: -whispering near my ear, mockingly- Oh Rick, they're gonna do it again!\n\nWaiter: We don't have a buffet, i haven't hear of it.\n\nSister: -pulling out her phone with the image of the buffet flyer- This one.\n\nWaiter: oh, i... I have to ask my manager, i know nothing of it.\n\n\nWaiter goes get manager and then both come to our table.\n\nManager: Hey, good evening, is everything lk, is there a problem?\n\nMe: Nope, we were just asking about the buffet, we'd all like to order it, please.\n\nManager: i don't think i've heard of ANY buffets, you must be mistaken.\n\n(I have to point out that THIS specific PearWasp's...'s facebook account is the one that posted this. Literally no other specific building of their company was promoting the offer)\n\nMe: Here, this buffet -showing him the image on the phone from their account-.\n\nManager: OHHHHH THAT BUFFET, YEAH, TOTALLY! Thing is that it's not for this year, it's for 2022!\n\n\n(We were all confused, i spoke again, raising an eyebrow confused, not in a Karenish way)\n\n\nMe: So you're saying that you have a \"goodbye old year\" add, posted 4 hours ago, december 2021... To promote an event for... The year 2022? A year in advance?\n\nWaiter: -Smiling- That is correct, sir.\n\nMe: So if i come back here in 12 months... Does THIS apply?\n\nWaiter: Most certainly.\n\n\nMe: Fine, we're leaving.\n\nWaiter: -Following us to the exit- Thank you, hope to see you soon!\n\n\nNeedless to say, even though we used to eat there often, well not anymore.\n\nAfter try 3, my brothers replied to their post on it, mentioning it was for 2022 and how we were treated. That joint's account responded \"Thank you for coming!\"\n\n\n\nWe weren't rude, we weren't Just going to have that. Again, why would they behave like that and not even go to silly extremes like trying to force my order or denying any sense in their own flyers, but also mocking us on the way out? \n\n\nWell, one less bee to worry about.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1646956925.0},{"title":"Mexican restaurant doesn\u2019t mean free chips and salsa","author":"PulpyEnlightenment","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/tbgeuc\/mexican_restaurant_doesnt_mean_free_chips_and\/","text":"I decided to eat lunch at a Mexican restaurant near my doctors appt I had, giving myself an hour to eat and walk across street.

A food runner brings out the hot plate with meat and peppers and covered in cheese sauce. No sides or tortillas, just a sizzling plate and an empty glass for about 5 minutes. \nMy waitress comes over and asks how everything is, I point out that I wanted cheese sauce on side, and asked about the sides and said can I have another glass of water, no ice. She brings water, with ice again, and toppings with tortillas. I start to make a taco with tortilla and lettuce etc and noticed there\u2019s a piece of foil in my rice and beans.

At this point I\u2019ve been there 30 minutes and I tell her it\u2019s ok I\u2019ll just make sure there\u2019s not anymore but to tell kitchen to be careful so no one else gets foil in their food. \nI eat about half of my food and ask for the bill, when it comes I am charged for chips and salsa, and queso. I tell her that I asked for it on the side and specifically asked if chips and salsa were free before ordering and asked for her to remove them from the bill. She takes the ticket and speaks to a manager, when she comes back she tells me she took off the cheese but had to charge for chips and salsa, however she did discount 2$ for the foil. Ok no biggie, whatever, they canceled each other out. I then asked for a box and small bowl for queso.\nShe only brought back a box, I again ask for a small bowl, she brings a small box, I then point to the queso and say a small bowl\nFor the queso please.

We went to a restaurant and had a great time. Our server was amazing, the food was great, it was just a perfect evening. We decided we wanted to return 2 days later. \n\n[Now this is important, since most people by default expect any redditor to be from the US: I am from Germany, tipping is not mandatory, servers get enough salary to cover their basic needs. It is however normal to tip according to the service you received, alas not as much as an American would. E.g. for a bill of 46,80\u20ac you'd probably tip 3,20\u20ac to make it 50\u20ac and the server wouldn't be offended in the least.]\n\nWhen the bill came, it was something just above 80\u20ac. Since we were so pleased with the service and the food, I gave the server 100\u20ac. So almost 20\u20ac tip. Then we asked him about a reservation for two days later. He was ecstatic about the tip and made sure to put us down with a little VIP next to our names (as he explained to us, this would ensure that we would get the best service), because he wouldn't be in that day and wanted his colleagues to know.\n\nWhen we returned, after stating that we had a reservation under our name, we were brought to a table and then... well, basically we had to stand up and go to the kitchen doors, where the servers were chilling, for EVERYTHING. Even for the menus. We waited 15min for the menus, then 15min after closing the menus (common sign of \"ready to order\") we had to get up and ask to order, then we waited 45min for the appetizers (which were sushi) and we could see them sitting on the counter for 10min before being brought to us. Had to get up and ask for the main course to be prepared because even though we had been done with the sushi for 10min, nothing happened. This went on. We were there almost 4 hours, for what we had planned to be a 2h visit. We even had to ask for every single drink refill.\n\nSo we didn't leave a tip at the end. And the server didn't even flinch at that. It seemed that she was very aware of her shitty behaviour. We never found out what was going on that day. We're not confrontational, so we didn't ask for a manager or anything, but we didn't return for a few weeks and when we came by and saw our first server, we asked which days he was working and made it a point of only going in on these days.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1646897235.0},{"title":"It\u2019s not the 1950\u2019s","author":"blakesmate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/taqv5v\/its_not_the_1950s\/","text":"A different post made me think about this situation, and I\u2019ve also been dealing with homeowners\/car insurance again because it\u2019s that time.

I ordered photos yesterday from a well known drug store with a nice, convenient photo department that lets you order prints online.  One of which was an 11 x 14.  I got the email that they were ready this morning so I went to pick them up; the woman working the counter couldn't find the order.  Finally she found it, they hadn't been printed yet.  No problem, I told her I'd be back this afternoon.\n\nSecond time I go back the photos are ready, great!  Except when I get home and open them the 11 x 14 is torn and the ink is smudged.  The rest were fine so I took that one *back* to the store in my third trip of the day.  At this point I'm a little irritated but shit happens, it's not a big deal.  WRONG.  I WAS SO WRONG.  I kindly explained to the same woman what the issue was and that I'd like a reprint.  She opens the envelope and gives me a look of utter contempt. \"NO MA'AM I PUT THIS PICTURE IN THE ENVELOPE MYSELF IT WAS *NOT* LIKE THIS WHEN I PACKAGED IT\". \n\nI was honestly floored.  She'd been nice the two previous times and now she'd turned into an accusatory, bitchy harpy.  I guess she thought I went home, ripped the photo, somehow smeared the now dry ink, and decided to con them out of a grand total of $5.99?  I have better things to do with my time lady, which is why I'm really pissed off that I've been back to this store three times for the same damn photo!\n\nIt takes me a minute to get mad, so I nicely explained that it had in fact been like that when I opened the envelope and no I didn't rip it or smear the ink.  She stomps off and tells me it'll be awhile, in an incredibly bitchy tone.  Now I'm *pissed*.  I'm still angry and it's now 10pm.  So I follow her and inform her I want it done ASAP and I will not be paying for the reprint.  I got home and called to speak to the store manager to explain what happened and to confirm I wouldn't be paying for the reprint.  Hell would freeze over before I paid for that reprint (I didn't actually tell her that lol). Yes it's only 5.99 but I'm not paying you twice when your employees obviously don't give a damn about their job.\n\nTo finish up a very long story (sorry) I apparently pissed off every employee there by calling the store manager.  A different woman waited on me when I went back for the FOURTH time; she was very unpleasant.  When I walked out a different employee I'd never seen before said \"thanks for shopping with us\" in an incredibly snarky tone.  At that point I was done, went home and wrote their corporate a nice long email about their shitty employees (no I didn't actually call them shitty, except in my head lol).  \n\nI just don't get it.  I know people can be hard to deal with, I worked customer service for over 12 years.  But my god these people didn't give two shits about their job, their attitude, or the product they were giving me.  And I was nice about it!  It's not like I stood there and screamed at them!  She HAD to have seen the photo was torn and smudged, did she think I'd just shrug and say \"oh well, it's fine\"???  Who does that?  What is wrong with people lately???  It's like customer service has completely disappeared!  I went to the grocery store the other day and the cashier actually rolled her eyes when I walked up to check out!

I would never want to work there, and I'm sure it can put you in a mood. I have worked in customer service for 10 years and people are awful. That being said, here's a story about an encounter I had with a very bitter customer service manager.\n\nOne night, I decided to go and get a new Xbox game from local store. I get home and the game doesn't work. I'm a pretty tech-savvy guy, so I start doing everything I can think of. I checked the disk, restarted the Xbox, checked for updates, made sure that my other games were still working. I spent an hour trying to fix it. The game was a dud. I check online, and it says that you must go to the retailer for a refund. \n\nI go to the store the next day and tell the girl working the desk that I'm trying to get it refunded since it doesn't work. She nicely tells me that they can't do refunds on games. We're having a very pleasant exchange, and I ask her if there's anyone who might be able to do that since the game is a dud. She goes and gets her manager for me. Up to this point, everything is very pleasant and everyone is being mature. The manager then comes up ready to stonewall me. She immediately has a real smug tone and says \"we don't do refunds on video games. No exceptions.\" I explained to her that the game doesn't work and it cost me 60 bucks. She just keeps her repeating to me that policy is that they don't do refunds on games. I try to understand that she deals with nasty people all day, and so I try to keep the conversation pleasant, but I am firm in my request for a refund. This manager was taking so much joy in telling me no. She obviously has the ability to make these judgment calls, but she wants to upset me. I ask her if there's anybody else that was able to do a refund on this. She again responds in a very smug way \"nope. I'm end of the line.\"\n\nI realized that I'm never going to get anywhere with her, so I leave and just try calling corporate. They tell me that they cannot override the store decision, which surprised me. They end up forwarding me to this same rude lady at the store and we end up having a repeat of the conversation we had at the store. At this point, I am not berating anybody, but I can't hide that I'm getting upset about the situation. I ask her how it could possibly be the store's policy to just steal from their customers. She is loving that she gets a reaction out of me, so I just end the conversation.\n\nAt this point, she has got under my skin. I'm out 60 bucks and this very smug person is taking so much joy in preventing me from getting a simple refund. So, I submit a complaint to BBB. I didn't think it would accomplish anything, but I was angry. A week later, the manager of the whole store ends up reaching out to me and says that they should have definitely refunded me for a dud game. She tells me to go back to the store and ask for Ashley (we'll say that's her name). I got back to the store the next day and ask for this Ashley. They go and get her. Come to find out, Ashley is the smug lady who was taking so much joy in denying me the refund that I was owed. I like to think of myself as the opposite of an entitled, nasty customer, but I cannot even begin to express how much joy I took in seeing the anger in that witch's face.

The host and wait staff treated me and my friends extra nice because of the occasion. The evening started off great with me breaking open my chopsticks and find a huge splinter sticking out of one. Not sure how to explain it, but I've never seen it splinter like that before. It looked like the tentacle spike from Don't Starve but with only one spike sticking out. Seemed out of place for a nice set of single-use chopsticks. I didn't think it was a big deal but asked for a replacement anyway. My host kinda freaked out and got a new pair. At the end of the night, they comped me a dessert or app I got that night and my host's manager came over to apologize. It seemed Japanese-run so I hope my host didn't get in trouble for those chopsticks. \n\n2) Booked a crab place for Father's day for my dad and family. It's one of those places where you choose the seafood and the seasoning and they make it for you. You put on gloves and a bib to minimize the mess. I found A SINGLE HAIR in one of the more expensive bowls that looked almost like a pube. It was on the shell of a crab leg so I figured just brush it off and eat the meat. I let a manager know before we ate it just so they knew someone has to put on sanitary gear in the back. They also kinda freaked out and brought out a completely new bowl of crab legs. My sister was very happy with the extra crab. I didn't complain either. \n\nI don't need a lot when I go out to eat. Just keep my water full, check on us every once in a while, and deliver decent food. I still felt like maybe they overreacted in these two incidents. Then again, both of these were special occasions. I just hope none of the workers got into major trouble in either of these situations. Either way, I was happy at the end of my eating experiences at both places and would go again.

These certificates are produced by mechanics, but signed off on by our DMV equivalent (actually combined offices for provincial services, which are actually operated by private franchise holders for extra fun and games).\n\nIn the end it was three rounds, and I still didn't actually get anything done.  Each time I went to the DMV there was a new reason that the safety (done by a major chain of auto shops attached to a larger store) was invalid, each time amounting to them claiming that one box or another had been \"altered\". Telling them I was there when it was written out wasn't good enough, and both times I went back to the mechanic they found a different problem with a new form. Didn't matter what I fucking said about LITERALLY WATCHING THE MECHANIC FILL IT OUT.\n\nWhen I got the manager and complained that the agent at the desk had said I was lying she just kept repeating to talk to my mechanic again, that she had no obligation to accept A COMPLETE AND VALID FORM.  Each time I tried to walk through the issue, each time she started talking over me, and every time I asked her to let me speak she told be to be civil and then threatened to call security.\n\nOn visit three to the shop, they refused to re-issue the document.  Said they needed a manager to look over it.  No manager today.  And ABOSLUTELY NO REFUNDS WITHOUT A MANAGER.  Says the store manager I might add.  No no, he says.  You don't understand, how could I, as a store manager, POSSIBLY refund anything without the shop manager around?  And how could the guy we have on the counter POSSIBLY issue a new certificate without the mechanic present.  How could he POSSIBLY sign for the vehicle's safety, never mind that the fucking mechanic had already signed twice, and cocked up the form both times.\n\nAt my third visit to the DMV they \"realized\" they could do a temporary title and get the safety later... but charged me $15 extra to do it.  And of course no negotiation, no discussion, we're the government (but not really, private operator remember), fuck you, pay us and stop complaining or I'll call security.\n\nSo as things stand, after going back and fourth three times, I am out the cost of a safety inspection, out the cost of a temporary registration, still don't have a permanent registration and still don't have a safety certificate the government will accept (despite, you know, the car passing safety without questions).\n\nI've got half a mind to think it's actually a scam to make everyone who buys a used car do the temporary registration, but JFC that's a lot of effort for $15.

Probably spent somewhere around $50.  As I got on line, I grabbed a cheap bouquet of flowers.  There was a woman in front of me who had gotten all of her groceries onto the belt.  I looked for a divider, couldn't find one, so about a foot behind the woman in front of me, I used the flower bouquet across the belt to start my groceries.  In the meantime, someone got on line behind me.\n\nThe woman in front of me told the cashier that the flowers weren't hers.  I heard her loud and clear and there was so much space between her order and the flowers that it seemed clear to me.  I guess the cashier didn't hear her and didn't notice the space; she picked up the flowers to ring them up.  I said, loud enough to hear but not shouting, \"No those are mine!\"  \n\nCashier said rather loudly, \"Well you should use a divider!\"  I told her there wasn't a divider so she grabbed two of them from next to the register, tossed them down the line and said, \"Yes there are!  Right there!\"  \n\nAt this point, the woman behind asked what's wrong, since she saw dividers getting tossed.  I just told her I had no idea but it seemed like maybe someone was having a bad morning.  I was only facing her when I said it.\n\nNext it's my turn for groceries.  Cashier grabs my cart and whips it around the end of the line.  She says (very aggressively) \"Flaps up!\" as she puts up the flaps of the place where a child would sit.  She actually said it once for each flap.  I didn't know this was a rule.\n\nWhile shopping, I had grabbed a bottle of hand sanitizer to keep in the car since it was just 10 cents per bottle.  She scanned the bottle, looked at me and yelled, \"Ten Cents?!.... Really?... Really\" as she leaned half over the belt to get in my face.  I just stared.  What am I supposed to say to that? \n\nShe was practically throwing my items into the cart as she rang them up, commenting rudely as she progressed.  At the end of the order, I paid by credit card.  While I entered my info into the card reader, she grabbed my cart and ran it over to the counter, nowhere near where I'd be standing, and left my groceries there unattended, roughly 25' away.  She came back, pulled out the receipt and handed it to me.  I didn't thank her as I was pretty much in shock over getting yelled at through the entire order and keeping an eye on my cart.  As I walked away, she shouted, \"You're welcome!\"  At this point, I'd had enough and turned around and yelled, \"So are you!\"\n\nThis bothered me all day long.  I was baffled as to why she singled me out for this behavior.  Maybe she thought I said something else to the woman behind me when she tossed the dividers at me?  I don't know.  I couldn't let it rest.  \n\nOn my way home, I stopped back to speak to management.  I wasn't trying to be a Karen but I swear, this was bizarre!  As I started telling the manager, who was an absolute sweetheart, I barely got started with explaining it all and she started nodding her head.  She already knew who I was talking about.

And while I was out, I was hunting for a foot rest to use with my computer chair. I like having led support when chilling at my desk. And I was hoping to find a cheap used foot rest at a second hand store. All new ones are way too expensive, and the cheapest of them have very questionable quality. I stopped by several stores looking for one, but didn't find anything that would work on my budget.\n\nThen at the last store I went to, who's name rhymes with Floss, had a fantastic looking foot rest. And it was built just the way I liked. But it was $45. Which was the best price on a new one I'd found thus far. So I said \"Screw it!\" and buy it anyway because I was tired of hunting for one of these. I picked it up and inspected it, even tested it by sitting on a chair and seeing how it held up my legs. And it was absolutely perfect. The base was even made in such a way that it wouldn't scrape the floor because it had a solid bottom instead of feet. Now I had to have this thing. So I inspected it one last time, then took it to the register to buy it. And the clerk really liked it too.\n\nThis is where it gets stupid. I left the store and got half way to my truck with a big stupid grin on my face when the foot rest literally fell apart in my hands. The whole bottom fell off of it. The wood screws just came right out. I could hear each one as it made a little \"TING!\" sound on the asphalt. I had to find all four screws in the dark, which was not easy as this was like 7:30 PM in February. So it was pretty dark by then. I managed to pick up all of the pieces and took the foot rest back inside. The cashier took one look at it and asked me what happened. And was dumbfounded when I explained.\n\nShe said she could give me a full return on it so long as I still had the receipt, and I did. Then I pointed out there was a chance I could fix it with better screws at home. But to take that chance I'd like to get it cheaper if possible. The clerk called for help from a manager. And then an assistant manager showed up, took one look at the foot rest that was sitting in two pieces on the counter and asked what happened. And the clerk told he that not five minutes before she'd sold me that foot rest and it literally fell apart right after I walked out the doors. The manager then said that if I still wanted it as is, she could offer me a 15% discount on a partial refund. But that amounted to $6. I gave it some thought and just decided to return it because I didn't want to risk keeping it with that much money down the drain on the possibility I may be able to fix it. So I just said to take it back. The manager then told me that no one in the store has the power to do more than a %15 discount on anything since it was already a discount store. Apparently the store can't price it too low or they make nothing on it. So if it breaks, they just file it as a tax write-off and then destroy the broken product. So yeah, that poor foot rest is on it's way to the dump. And I still don't have one for my feet at home.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1645411264.0},{"title":"Nothing is Working at Grohl's (not their real name).","author":"jippyzippylippy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/sx35zn\/nothing_is_working_at_grohls_not_their_real_name\/","text":"Recently got an updated credit card for Grohl's.

My son had terrible colic. He would scream and cry for hours on end. Later we would learn it was due to sensory issues caused by his autism, but at the time all the pediatrician could tell us was that he would grow out of it. \n\nI could only leave the house for short periods of time with him because he would fuss and cry the whole time. And, of course, I would often receive \u201chelpful\u201d suggestions from older ladies. One that drove me crazy was ladies telling me I needed to feed my son. I mean, did they really think that I wasn\u2019t feeding him?\n\nI had a few places that were near my house that I would go to when I needed out during the middle of the day when my husband wasn\u2019t home to watch our son. One of these places was a grocery store only 5 minutes from our house. The only problem was that there was a lady, probably in her 50s, who worked there and every time she saw me with my fussy son, she would call out to me that I needed to feed him. \n\nShe worked at the deli counter which was right by the only entrance to the store, so I couldn\u2019t avoid her. It never failed, each time I walked in I would hear, in a sing-song-judgy voice, \u201cI think he\u2019s hungry,\u201d or \u201cYou need to feed him.\u201d Now one of my routines I would do before I left the house was to feed him. Then I would quickly get him in his car seat and race out the door while he was at least a little happier than usual. So I knew for a fact he was not hungry. I even went up to her once, trying to explain my situation, that my son was not hungry, just colicky. She didn\u2019t care and the harassment continued. \n\nI stopped going to the store as often, but it was really the only place nearby I could get out to since it was the middle of winter. And this grocery store was much smaller than others, so I could get through the whole place and check out just before a meltdown could happen. \n\nWhen I did go, I would scowl at her as I passed and she called out her suggestion to me. This did nothing to deter her, which is pretty impressive since I have a RBF that will make grown men run in fear. \n\nFinally, one day I had had enough. I had to go to the store for something I couldn\u2019t wait until my husband got home to go get. So I psyched myself up for the usual gauntlet I had to run to get past the main entrance. Except, I must have been in a really bad mood, because as soon as she called out her usual greeting I yelled back something along the lines of, \u201cWould you please stop!\u201d She was a little taken aback, because I had never lost it with her before. I was a little taken aback myself because I usually avoided making a scene. As I turned away from her I immediately see one of the store managers standing nearby in the produce section looking at me and her in surprise. Completely embarrassed, I put my head down and hurried away, convinced I could never shop at that store again. \n\nHowever, later as I was leaving with my groceries, the same manager approached me. He handed me a gift card to the store and told me how much they appreciated my business and he hoped I would always feel comfortable coming to the store. I think I mumbled some sort of thanks as I tried to fight back tears (it was a stressful time) and made as graceful an exit as I could. \n\nThe next time I went to that store, the woman at the deli counter was still there, but this time she just glared at me and didn\u2019t say anything. I became a very loyal customer to the store after that. \n\nTL;DR- A lady who worked at the grocery store would constantly harass me, telling me my colicky son was just fussy because I didn\u2019t feed him. One day I snapped at her and a nearby store manager overhears the exchange. He must have spoken with her, because she never bothered me again while I was shopping.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1644884786.0},{"title":"Was I being a Karen?","author":"essent1a","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/ssew5p\/was_i_being_a_karen\/","text":"I worked as a server for many years so I'm usually pretty understanding, but I think this may be the first time I've turned into a Karen and need outside perspective.\n\nAbout two weeks ago my boyfriend makes a Valentines Day weekend reservation for us at this cute hip pizza place.

I was working on a private, *very* minor audio project, and not yet being aware of the truly astounding bounty secreted away in the one-off electronics supply stores that lurked in dingy, old strip centers of this engineering-centric population center, I made my way to Rat Shack. Back then the Rat Shack carried a modest supply of standard electronic components and was pretty ubiquitous, so it was my go-to for basic stuff such as wires and plugs. They also had a [well-deserved reputation](https:\/\/dilbert.com\/strip\/1989-05-11) for \"helping\" their customers, which was mildly aggravating to competent techies. My \"regular\" stores back home knew not to \"help\" me, but I'd never been in this one before.\n\nI looked at the pre-built stuff to confirm my expectation that they had adaptors for what I wanted to connect, but no single cord long enough for my purposes. No worries, it was much cheaper to buy wire and jacks to build exactly what I wanted, and I've always enjoyed an excuse to solder, so I grabbed a spool of three-conductor wire (Labeled \"Intercom Wire\") and the proper plugs, then headed to the counter.\n\nThe 50-ish year old lady working the counter greeted me politely, looked over my collection of parts and apparently decided that a business casually dressed young man, who had picked out individual components, obviously needed some \"support\" to prevent his screwing up whatever she imagined I was doing.\n\n\"You're not planning to wire a phone with this wire, are you?\" she inquired.\n\nFiguring she meant to tell me that phones need four conductors, but knowing that phones typically use only two of the four (*and* being an arrogant young so and so), I responded, \"I could, but no, I'm not.\"\n\n\"Oh? What are you planning to do with it?\" she rejoined.\n\n\"I'm running an audio line from my TV to my [boombox](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boombox).\" I answered, thinking that living vicariously through customers' projects probably eased the crushing monotony of working at Rat Shack in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Oh! We have cables made for that!\" she informed me brightly, stepping out from behind the counter to show me.\n\nWith a sinking feeling, I explained \"I looked at what you have, you don't have what I need to do what I want, so I'll just build it myself.\"\n\nAgilely evading my subtle display of cluefulness, she returned to the now evident crux of her original question: \"Well, you can't use *this* wire for that.\"\n\nI admit to being mildly nonplussed by this, so after blinking at her a couple of times (in case the second time helped: it didn't) I asked, \" ... why not?\"\n\nShe informed me tolerantly, \"Oh, well it's 'Intercom Wire' \u2013 see?\" tapping the label on the spool (in case I didn't recognize the source of her unassailable expertise).\n\nSeveral things jumbled through my head, among them: \"intercoms and TV audio are both audio signals\", \"copper is copper\", \"audio signals are sent electrically\", but the one I had to haul myself back from saying was \"I have a degree in Electronics Engineering from Texas A&M University, what do you got?\"\n\nAs evidence that, even then, I had already recognized the desirability of resisting my congenital arrogance, I responded somewhat stiffly, \"How about you sell me what I want to buy, and if it doesn't work, that will be *my* fault?\" Definitely more of a statement than a question, though.\n\nSo that's what happened. Aside from courtesy mouth-noises, neither of us really said any more, but her facial expression and demeanor expressed her disapprobation with my headstrong ignorance eloquently enough. Even as my annoyance was sufficiently, silently evident.\n\nI went home and built my cable in less time than I'd spent in the store. It worked just fine, thank you ever so much, until I moved a year later and no longer needed it. That may well have been the last time I went into a Rat Shack until I moved back to Texas, where cool one-off e-supply stores are far less common.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1644769520.0},{"title":"They gave me the wrong order...","author":"Cut-Unique","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/srxrwy\/they_gave_me_the_wrong_order\/","text":"This happened pre-Covid, so no masks, social distancing, etc. Had this happened during the pandemic, I think it would have been a much bigger issue for everyone involved.\n\nSo one day a few years ago, I (then-late-20s M) was at the local branch of a certain 1950s-style diner associated with a certain 1970s movie which was written and directed by a certain man who later created a certain, very successful, space opera movie franchise (not naming any names but I'm sure you can figure out which establishment this is). Most of the staff at this restaurant were polite but not especially warm and friendly.\n\nI sit down at a table with a booth. At the next table over is a middle-aged man being waited on by a girl around my age who looks like she's in a horrible mood. The tables were close enough that I could hear what he was ordering. If I remember correctly he had ordered the appetizer sampler (basically a bit of everything on the appetizer menu on one plate). When he'd finished placing his order the waitress said \"Okay\" in a blah-sounding \"I hate this job\" tone of voice, and walked away.\n\nThe waitress who took my order was a middle-aged lady who spoke in a much nicer tone of voice. I had ordered chicken strips with fries and ranch dressing (also from the appetizer menu), and a Mocha Java shake. Usually the shake would arrive before the food, and I would wait to drink it until I got the food. Not this time.\n\nA few minutes go by and the grumpy young waitress comes over to my table and plonks a platter in front of me that I'm assuming is my order, says \"Here you go\" in her blah voice, and quickly walks away. I think nothing of it, and continue to patiently wait for my shake to arrive before I start eating. Eventually I see the waitress who took my order walk over to the shake machine to prepare my Mocha Java. Meanwhile I notice the guy at the next table over is sort of looking at me in a weird way. I ignore him, and continue to wait.\n\nFinally the waitress who took my order arrives with my shake, places it carefully on the table, apologizes politely for the wait time, and walks away. I take a sip of the sinfully-sweet beverage, and then prepare to dig in. Only then do I notice what's in front of me.\n\nI see chicken strips and fries, which I had ordered, but in addition there were a bunch of other things that I didn't order. Everything was covered in the same golden-brown batter, hence why it didn't occur to me right away that something was wrong. There were also a bunch of cups of various dipping sauces in addition to ranch dressing.\n\nI see the grumpy young waitress walk out of the kitchen, and I quickly flag her down before she rushes by. I tell her that she gave me the wrong order. Without saying anything, she whisks the plate away, goes up to the guy at the table in front of me and plonks the plate in front of him, then quickly walks away. Unfortunately, because I had waited for my shake to be ready, the food was no longer fresh-out-of-the-oven hot. The guy looks disappointed (I don't blame him), but begins eating. Meanwhile, I continued to wait to drink the rest of my shake until my chicken strips arrived. They were as good as they usually were, but the whole thing was super awkward.\n\nThat was the last time I ate there. During the pandemic, the restaurant (not the chain, just the individual restaurant) permanently closed for reasons unknown.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1644800138.0},{"title":"Accidentally insulted the bag boy\u2026","author":"tanzanite20","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/sqt80w\/accidentally_insulted_the_bag_boy\/","text":"I was in a small beach town last summer, at the cottage.  Stopped at the local grocery store for supplies.  They have baggers at the store.  I asked the bagger not to bag my stuff as I had my own bags in my backpack.  He just smiled and kept going. So, I just shrugged and figured I\u2019d sort everything when I got to the car.  At the car I emptied everything into the trunk, sorted and rebagged my stuff.  The bagger saw me, and called the manager.\n\nSo I ended up standing in the parking lot having a discussion with the store manager who was trying to get me to apologize to the bagger.  Like seriously?  I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been on the road for hours, I\u2019m tired, sweaty, hungry, and have a migraine by this point.  I was done being polite.  I told the manager that I had asked the bagger NOT to bag my shit as I had my own bags and he ignored me.   I then told the manager that I will be happy to drive the 45 minutes to the next town from now on for my groceries so I don\u2019t offend his staff when they ignore me, then insult me by crying to the manager over an imagined slight.\n\nTurns out the bag boy was his 13 yro son.  And part of his imagined insult was that I didn\u2019t tip him.\n\nETA:  Dad was giving the kid a chance to earn some money.  Teaching the kid the value of money and the value of hard work at a time when able-bodied people were unwilling to work.\n\nKid was paid minimum wage, so please don\u2019t assume he was not paid, or paid less than a cashier.  Plus at 13, he lives with his parents, so \u201cliving wage\u201d to a kid means being able to buy a switch without asking Mom and Dad for the money\u2026\n\nSince it was cottage country, and most \u201cbig city folk\u201d appreciate someone else bagging and delivering to the car, the kid had been making tips from most of the cottagers and he made the assumption that it was normal, and a given, to be tipped.  I mean he\u2019s 13\u2026\n\nThe kid was big enough to be mistaken for a 16 yro, so please, stop with the \u201cyou were cruel to a child\u201d crap.\n\nAnd for the people saying I was unreasonable, not that it is any of your business.  My control over my OCD is tenuous at best when I have a migraine.  Rather than embarrass the kid by stopping him and making him re-bag, it was easier for me to just let it go and fix it myself.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1644677649.0},{"title":"Poor customer service by a plumber.","author":"QAGUY47","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCustomer\/comments\/sqimzo\/poor_customer_service_by_a_plumber\/","text":"On Wed, Feb 9, I contacted a Plumbing company  for a problem I was having with my main line into the house.

They had  good reviews,the salon was  clean,  and seemed to be modern and updated. The owner in the beginning was very nice ,kind and friendly. \n\nMy first hair appointment with her I was grateful for anything because my hair was long overdue. This was my first hair appointment since the pandemic had shut down everything. So I wasn\u2019t being too picky. \n\nThe second time around, getting the same hairstyle she did a much better job. She was very friendly very nice. \n\nThe third time I went back to her I was fully pregnant at this time and wasn\u2019t late I arrived exactly on time for my appointment. \n\nDue to Covid I didn\u2019t want to sit in the salon with other customers and potentially expose myself when I\u2019m pregnant. \n\nNext thing I know as I\u2019m pulling up to park my car. I get a phone call and she\u2019s raging on the phone. At first I couldn\u2019t hear her so I kept saying \u201c hello I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you \u201c and then I guess she got frustrated and raised her voice and was like, \u201cyour appointment is at 10 and you\u2019re not here!!!\u201d\n\nI could tell that she was pissed. Maybe it was my hormones but I did not appreciate her using that tone with me and being so nasty. Till this day that really still bothers me. \n\nThings happen and sometimes there\u2019s traffic or other things going on you\u2019re not always necessarily able to call in advance but I wasn\u2019t late I was exactly on time. \n\nso there was no need for me to call in advance to say that I\u2019m not arriving exactly at 10 o\u2019clock.\n\nWhen I walked into the salon frazzled and you know just feeling really bad I apologized and she was like \u201cmy clients cannot be late for appointments on the weekend\u201d You need to be in your chair before you appointment starts\u201d. \n\n She never really mentioned how strict her policies were for tardiness. I just felt like I was being scolded and she had no compassion for me as someone that was 8 months pregnant at the time. I was much slower and had to take my time with everything I did. \n\nAfter the appointment I honestly didn\u2019t feel the same about her. \n\n(Also it is okay for her to run late and make me wait. Or call me the day of to push my appointment later or earlier. I am always flexible and agreeable. I never make a big fuss) so I took stock of her attitude. \n\nI did however return after having my baby to get a haircut and I arrived on time. When I asked her \u201chow she was doing ? the first thing she said to me was \u201ctired\u201d. \n\nI said \u201cOK\u201d and she was like \u201cI\u2019ve been very busy I\u2019ve had a lot of customers lately\u201d and I said \u201coh well that must be a good thing\u201d and she was like \u201cno because it\u2019s too much work and I\u2019m just very tired of it\u201d. \n\nI could tell if she was forcing herself to talk to me and to be decent. And I just didn\u2019t really feel comfortable anymore. In the very beginning she complimented my hair for being thick and long and beautiful. This was when I first started going to her. Now She was complaining about my hair being very thick and being a lot of work.\n\nAnother thing I almost forgot to mention was one time when I was calling to make my appointment. I asked her to hold on for one second as I confirmed the time with my husband. And she hung up on me. I had to call back and someone else took the call and made the appointment for me. I thought that was also very rude. So I guess the writings on the wall maybe she just doesn\u2019t want me as a client anymore.\n\nIf now it\u2019s a problem because she doesn\u2019t have enough help and her salon. That\u2019s not right to take it out on me. Don\u2019t take my appointment if you\u2019re not willing to put in the effort anymore. \n\nI always tip well and over the 20%. I\u2019m respectful I try my best to treat her the way I would want to be treated. I\u2019m not nasty or rude at all. So I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re all of this is coming from.\n\nAlso at the end of my last appointment with her where it was just a haircut and blow out she made a comment about well now I got to clean all of this up I got to clean everything up on my own. I almost felt guilty like do\nI need to sweep up the hair since it\u2019s mine ? It was just all very odd and I didn\u2019t know where it was coming from.\n\n\nThe only thing is that she has done a decent job on my hair however I am nervous about going back to someone that me may be so Moody. Should I give her another chance? or find another salon? It\u2019s always so hard to find a good place that is consistent.
