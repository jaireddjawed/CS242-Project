Some of these are highly prestigious and have supposedly great academics despite the lower cost.\n\nWhat are the reasons, if any, that a private university's extra cost is justified? For example, if you had the choice to pay 15k for Berkeley or 55k for Stanford, what are you getting for that extra 40k?\n\nAdditionally, if you had scholarships/ grants that made both cost the same, would it be the obvious choice to go with the private university in all cases? If so, why? If no, why not?",

Unfortunately, in my case, the rotation was basically a performance and I’ve been struggling for the last couple of years with no direction, no help, and an atmosphere where I couldn’t voice my concerns. \n\nLast week I decided I was over it. I was ready to master our and get a job. I talked to the grad student coordinator to find out what my options were and it turned out I had more options than I thought. \n\nI met with the dean of my department today and am overwhelmed with appreciation for my department. She assured me that this was more common than people think and offered me a TAship for spring for funding until I’m able to find a new lab. \n\nI thought my PhD journey was over because of a mistake I made at the end of my first year and honestly I just wish I had reached out for help sooner. \n\nPSA: don’t linger in a situation that’s not working. You don’t have to prove yourself to anyone, you don’t have to suffer needlessly under a PI who doesn’t offer the kind of mentorship you need. At the very least your programs want to stats, so they’ll help you move forward if you need it. \n\nI’m so happy with this decision. I was depressed and stressed and all of that emotion has evaporated. I’m actually looking forward to getting back to research once I find a new home in the program ❤️",

        "text": "Hi all, as a note before I begin, I'm going to talk to my therapist about this during our session on Wednesday, but until then I just wanted to get some stuff out and ask for advice from anyone who has had a similar experience. Also, I'm a student in microbiology with a BSc in biochemistry, so I know just about as much as the average person about psychology.\n\nSo as a background, I have been diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression since I was about 14, and I'm 23 now. I take SSRIs and they keep me mostly stable but that's it. From \\~ 8th grade until now I have had trouble with procrastination and paying attention in class, and I thought this was because I was either understimulated and bored, too depressed, or too anxious to engage. I made up for it by just re-teaching myself everything and cramming the night before. I still do this and I hate it, but a lot of people function like this so I figured any exacerbation was due to my mental health problems. I get good grades too, so there's no academic consequence for this behavior.\n\nI also have struggled with perfectionism and absolutely loathed any real or perceived rejection from anyone, making me ignore my needs and boundaries in favor of people-pleasing tendencies which of course causes me a lot of stress. Again though, there are a lot of introverted and socially anxious people in science that go through similar things.\n\nFinally, I have a few glaring symptoms that point me in the way of potentially being neurodivergent. First is that I have horrible sensory issues and have had them since I was a baby. Like yes, I have a \"sock system.\" Second is that I have been seen as \"weird\" my entire life, and have a hard time fitting in, but as I get older it seems people find that mostly endearing (or entertaining) about me. Oh and I always draw in class, meetings, or seminars, and if I don't I usually spend more of my energy looking like I'm paying attention rather than actually paying attention. More and more lately I cannot stand to sit for an hour-long seminar about anything.\n\nOkay, so about a year ago my mom came to me telling me that she had been learning a lot about ADHD lately and she was nearly positive I had it, for those reasons, among other symptoms including being really talkative, easily distracted, forgetful, etc. I spent a week or so seriously mulling it over and talking to friends and family about it, and most of them agreed I may have it. I went to my therapist to tell him I think I might have ADHD, and he told me that isn't really his specialty, he had not noticed me talk about symptoms related to ADHD, etc. He thought that my mom was trying to tell me there was something wrong with me that I needed to fix or something. This response honestly really freaked me out and I was so embarrassed that I just dropped it.\n\nSince then I have been really struggling with planning experiments, reading literature, and getting classwork done... *just* short of having any sort of consequences for it. Again, I'm writing my prelim, everyone in my cohort is stressed, and it's grad school. Which is always stressful. I just feel like I am doing much less than others while still having an incredibly hard time.\n\nThis has come to a head now that I realized that... my semester does not end this week. It ends next week, and I have an in-person final next week. And I planned to go visit my grandparents out of state next week. Have had a plane ticket for months and everything. Whether I can figure out what to do or not, this feels like such an embarrassing mistake on my part, compounded by so many other small mistakes in attention, time management, planning, etc. I have made over the semester (noticed by others or not) that I am really starting to see how much my mental health or possible neurodivergence is holding me back and causing me a lot of unwanted stress and pain.\n\nSo, I think it will bring me some peace to have a better understanding of how my brain works, whether I have ADHD or not. I think especially my sensitivity to rejection has been preventing me from seeking this out further, because it's hard to admit you have a problem, and there's a lot of stigma surrounding mental health already.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to navigate this or has had a similar experience, I would really appreciate the input. Anything from how to bring it up to my therapist again (scary), to finding testing, to managing ADHD symptoms would be great. Have a good rest of your day all.",

        "text": "Like the title says, I’ve been struggling with the decision to potentially leave my PhD program due to a cornucopia of reasons. First and foremost, I landed a full-time, TT job at a community college that doesn’t require me to finish my PhD other than for a minimal pay bump of $1000/year, and I love the work. On top of that, my dissertation chair routinely takes 3-4 weeks to respond to any of my emails and even longer, 1-2 months, to get me any comments for revision. Also, with the workload of a TT position, the dissertation writing has become toxic to my mental health. Further, I’ve found the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with and the stress my dissertation writing causes puts undue burden on a relationship I care about more than the PhD. So, long story short, I don’t see the point anymore other than pride and sunken costs (approx. 200k in debt). This is a humanities PhD btw. \n\nAnyway just looking to see if anyone else ever found themselves in a similar situation and what they did.",

My focus has been wildlife research, and I went in the direction of using iDNA to monitor wildlife populations and disease risk for my thesis. Both of my supervisors have indicated that I could get 2-3 published papers out of my thesis if I wanted to try submitting, and I'd like to continue research in this area, ideally in Germany. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Are my grades good enough to get accepted into PhD programs in my area of research?\n\n2) Does anyone have any advice for applying to programs with my own research proposal (as opposed to advertised positions)?\n\n3) Do I have to apply for funding before applying to programs?\n\n4) Would it be better to try to publish my papers before applying for PhD positions? (Keep in mind that I'll have 18 months to get a job or get into a program in order to stay in Germany.)\n\nAny other advice that anyone might have is also welcome!",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI'm curious your reactions to a scenario I was confronted with a few months ago and recently. I have a labmate, Bee, who approached me for a chat. She was visibly sad &amp; I am the senior PhD student in lab. \n\nBee began an extremely personal conversation about her family and TA stressors. I immediately pulled her into an office space because we were out in the open. That's not bad, it read to me she was giving an emotional dump that some of us need from time to time. I barely knew her but respected her privacy and emotion. We barely talked before this interaction.\n\nShe also revealed she has ADHD and told me her Adderall meds are not working anymore. She's scared because she cannot keep taking bigger doses &amp; she's not able to keep up pace with her research. I was the first person she told, according to Bee. I think the conversation was way too personal, I felt uncomfortable. But I didn't want to break her trust by discussing my concerns with the PI. I told her to take one day at a time and consult the PI with issues relating to your research. I recommended to stop increasing your doses &amp; chat with your doctor. And it's your decision to disclose your medical history with the PI during your time. It may be beneficial but it may not. \n\nFor me, I leave my personals out of the work environment. Also, I am diagnosed autistic so I understand why she confided in me. I seemed, surprisingly(!!), the most approachable for her. Hopefully, my lack of emotion didn't upset her. I mustered to give her a hug. The bigger doses part scared me. But now, Bee increased her frequency for personal chats. I don't know how to say gently to decrease these conversations with me and remove your emotion. I am in the phase of writing a a manuscript and my dissertation. And I don't want to reveal anything about myself honestly. \n\nHow would you all navigate here to avoid this from happening?  Bee is kind &amp; hardworking but it's too much emotional dumps and uncomfortable themes for me to take on as a 4th yr. It has become once a week now.\nAm I \"heartless\"?

I'm in my 30's, returning to school after a stint in the fine dining world, so I understand how to comport myself in professional environments, but this one's got me stumped.\n\nI received an email about my tardy assistantship time sheets (I found out I needed to do them well, well into the semester from a fellow grad a year ahead of me) with the implication that my funding could very well be in jeopardy. Here's the kicker, as I don't have an advisor/official advocate...I've barely been assigned any assistantship hours. Additionally, after asking my advisor where to send my first time sheet, I received back a confirmation and just assumed I was in the clear after that.\n\nEssentially, my questions are holy shirt, am I good or am I going to lose funding? Has anyone here had experience with an absent advisor and what was your course of action? And finally, how would you suggest I move forward in this dynamic--I want to advocate for myself but in a way that works within the academic model...are my frustrations fair or is this just the rub of grad school?",
