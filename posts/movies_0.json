Now the final boss of SA2 may not work given its context. But the main discussion is the use of the fan favourite song [Live and learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPBmDptqlQ&amp;ab_channel=blackblur7) playing in the background.\n\nOn the one hand, personally having that song play during the finale would be perfect even if the film was bad. But that's from a fans perspective.\n\nMy question to you is do you think you would like the song playing even if you're not a fan. Or do you think a general audience would be confused or wouldn't understand why they are playing a random rock song?\n\nAgain this question isn't directed at you but rather how a general audience would react to something like this.",

        "text": "I watched Knock at the Cabin when it first came out, and I’ve had this on my mind ever since I watched it. Now, I personally love this movie, and it’s currently my favourite movie of the year, but I found that a complaint a lot of people had about it was the ending. Specifically, there was nothing exciting to it, and it didn’t have that Shyamalan twist that made his other movies memorable. But I do believe there is a twist in this film. Nothing like the sixth sense, but there is more to the film then what we see. Let me explain.\n\nSo at the end of the movie, we see that the apocalypse has been resolved, and even though all the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse and Eric died, we know that the world is going to be ok. At least for a little bit…\n\nBut If you stick to the very end of the film, past the credits, you see the title of the film reappear and the audio of Dave Bautista knocking on the cabin door being played over it. Now, normally I’d think nothing more of it, but as this is Shyamalan, I think it could mean something. I believe the twist is that the apocalypse is only temporarily over, and that soon someone else will have to go through this trauma all over again. If you wanted to add onto this further, I think that Andrew and Wen might be the ones who will either go through this again or be the ones who get chosen to deliver the bad news.\n\nNow, of course I don’t believe this movie will get a sequel, and I know what I’m saying is just a theory, but I would love to hear anyone’s thoughts on it. Do you see where I’m coming from, or am I talking crazy. Whatever your thoughts, please feel free to share! 😄",

I just get completely absorbed into the vibes / atmosphere, the music, the cinematography, the editing, etc. Characters and story become secondary, I just love the experience of watching them. \n\nHowever, when I look to see how most people react to these movies, most people seem to react completely different. I always hear how Requiem for a Dream is so disturbing and hard to watch that people say they can't rewatch it. I get what they are saying, but I don't really get disturbed by watching it, I just enjoy the experience and have rewatched it multiple times. Same exact thing with Climax. I watch these movies and get into a trance. \n\nWith Uncut Gems for example everyone talks about how stressful and anxiety inducing it is, and I simply don't feel that when I watch the movie. I just get sucked into it and it feels like I'm on LSD and cocaine. I love it. \n\nSo am I just a total weirdo or what? The thing is there are certain movies that are able to tug on my heart strings and even get me to tear up. I also can't stand watching slasher movies, now those I find disturbing. But when it comes to like trippy ass movies I feel like I'm immune to being disturbed. Anyone else on here feel the same way? Also, any movie recommendations?",

It's adventurous and for me out of the franchise it is my favorite, and this is the film that made me a fan of Pedro Pascal, long before The Mandoloriaon and The Last of us show.\n\nThe first one was also really good but this one just got my favorite spot just from Pedro's performance and the plot.",

        "text": "I'm looking for movies where the first 1/4 or more of the movie is spent going down a completely different path than where the movie heads to later.\n\n*Psycho* immediately comes to mind. The movie starts out being about small time crime and just as you're getting comfortable with that plot, it completely is derailed by the bigger, main, plot.\n\n*10 Cloverfield Lane* was another. Kidnapping movie or?\n\n*Parasite (?)*, *Get Out* (although I am not sure if I would have thought that racism was the plot had I not heard the hype).\n\nThe Village and Alice (2022)?\n\nMaybe even *The Shining* fits this category?\n\n*Total Recall* doesn't fit this for me as it wasn't too long into the film where it was evident that there was something going on.\n\n*Everything Everywhere All At Once* triggered this question in me. I was originally thinking that it's a movie about immigrants in the US, and cultural pressures on them and their children, etc. - maybe it turned a little too soon?\n\n*Million Dollar Baby*?\n\nI'm not looking for movies with twists or surprise endings. Those where upon a rewatch you see all the clues to the twist or the surprise ending. I want it to be somewhat of a \"record scratch\"; things are going along, you're settling in for one kind of movie, and - scratch - you're whiplashed into something else.",

        "text": "Just watched this on Amazon Prime and wanted to express my thoughts somewhere while they were still fresh. See if people agree / disagree.\n\nOverall, I have to say I didn't care for it. It's an interesting idea, but it falls victim to the same issues that seem to plague a lot of more recent horror movies - the plot being held up by characters making bad decisions.\n\nAnd obviously, it's a horror movie. To some degree, this is unavoidable. Sure. But I feel that, in recent years, there seem to be over a dozen of these comically bad choices per movie instead of just 1 or 2. Or maybe I've just gotten more critical as I've gotten older. I guess that's also why I want to see other people's thoughts on this one.\n\nIf it were me, and I found myself seemingly hallucinating creepy smiley people, I wouldn't react like I'd just come face to face with Ctuhulu itself. And that's the protag's reaction. Almost the entire movie. Just pure, unbridled fear. Like, sure, it's unsettling, but really? You're gonna cry out in horror to a smiley person? After the first few times, I feel like I'd get used to it. Have the writers never played a game with jump scares? \n\nAlso, the other elephant in the room - horror movies and sci-fi. The whole \"I can see it but they can't\" thing is a pretty common trope these days in both genres. So, for a character to be as confused by the whole thing as a protagonist, you have to assume that she has basically never seen a horror movie or watched any real amount of science fiction.\n\nFor the first 2/3 of the movie, I'm here thinking to myself \"hmm....aliens with cloaking tech? Interdimensional beings that infect with some kind of sight virus? Actual demons? A ghost?\" I'd be super curious to test out my theories if I were her. I mean hell, she's a doctor right? I know she's a therapist, but as someone at least tangentially related to STEM, wouldn't you be SUPER curious about such a new discovery?\n\nI mean, she NEVER tries to touch it until the finale. My FIRST thought would be to see if I can physically attack it. To partially quote Arnie in Predator, to see if bleeds. Because you know what that means.\n\nAnd sure, by the end of the movie it's pretty clear that that wouldn't have worked anyway. It's some sort of \"corporeal but only when it wants to be\" demon that can't actually be killed. Honestly, the whole idea of it being \"unbeatable\" was a huge letdown.\n\nOf course, there are concessions I need to make as well:\n\n1) I'm not phased easily. Never have been. That's why I enjoy horror movies I think. The good ones anyway. So maybe, this entity purposely seeks out people who are, say, vulnerable to fear in the first place. By the end of the movie, it's pretty clear that the protagonist has a ton of trauma for it to feed on.\n\n2) It is entirely possible, within the context of the film, that the entity does something to the victim's brain chemistry to increase the fear response. I believe there is a specific chemical reaction for this, so it's not beyond the realm of imagination. In that case, the bad decisions and panicked responses make more sense.\n\nYou know what I did kind of enjoy though? I thought the whole thing would be some kind of allegory for confronting your trauma instead of letting it consume you, but the entity pulls one last epic prank at the end, after she's seemingly overcome her trauma. Kinda spitting in the face of the idea of the allegory in the first place, which was pretty amusing. Like, if nothing else, I dig the entity's style. That prank with the therapist was top tier, I'd have actually clapped for it lol.\n\nBut what do other people think?",
