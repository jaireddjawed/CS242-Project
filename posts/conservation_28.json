        "text": "Hey all,\n\nSo I'm about to start my MsC in wildlife and conservation biology. It is a research thesis program and I will be focusing on forest management. My program is abroad (in Germany) and my school is renowned for their forest/environmental science programs since it is in the black forest. There are a lot of opportunities to get research/management experience which I will take full advantage of.\n\nI am thinking long term and know that I want to work with the government doing forest management/planning in the western U.S.. If any of you are wondering why I wanted to go abroad for my degree, its because its always been a dream of mine to live in another country and learn a new language so I figured I would kill two birds with one stone with this program.\n\nAnyways, to my overall point, I want to make this dream of working for the government a reality after I graduate. I have three potential ideas for making this a reality once I am done with school and I want to know the pros and cons of each.\n\nMy first idea is to get a PhD at a school out west after I get my masters. I know that a PhD is a great way to make connections and get access to higher level positions in the public sector. The cons of this that I know of are that it will take around 5 years to complete this and it is a daunting task.\n\nMy second idea is to join the peace corps after I graduate hopefully in a position that utilizes sustainable forestry management. This would be shorter than a PhD and would also give me the NCE that peace corp volunteers receive. I also like the idea of living abroad longer but am worried about no income for 4 years.\n\nMy last idea would be just to apply to internships/seasonal positions with the government and try to get my foot in the door that way. I know of one program that I would eligible for a 5-month paid internship and I would hope that with my research experience/MsC that I would be in good shape to find a permanent position.\n\nThese are my thoughts. Sorry for the wall of text. I wanted to get some input from people who have potentially gone through what I am right now. I know that my priority in grad school should be to have a good gpa and get as much research experience as I can.",

My friend is working to build Conserve With Us (CWU), a microdonations platform that helps enable everyday people to join together for land and wilderness conservation.  Users will be able to donate towards protecting specific properties. The platform will aggregate the donations and give them directly to land trusts that can conserve the land and wildlife.  For those unfamiliar, land trusts are local land conservation non-profits that buy and protect land or place binding conservation easements on private properties that prohibit development or destruction of that land, keeping it safe and pristine.\n\nMy friend is now working on it full time and he’s a finalist for a National Geographic Chasing Genius Award, which would give CWU $25,000 if he wins.  However, we need votes to secure the award, so we’re calling all redditors who think this idea can make a difference.\n\nPlease help him win by voting for the project. You can vote **once per day** until September 15 — here's how:\n\n* Visit the [project page](http://www.natgeochasinggenius.com/video/1786) on the Nat Geo Chasing Genius site\n* Authenticate via Facebook or email to prove you’re not a robot.\n* Click the yellow star on the video to vote.\n* Keep voting each day to show your support!  \n\nAlso, if you work with a local land trust that might be interested in using this platform, please let me know and I can connect them. \n\nThanks for your support!\n",

No major positive news in a sea of dissappointment. And I know that random observations on th Internet may not be the best source, but nearly every time I see a young person talk about the environment, there is a prolific aditude that it is worthless. More than one time I have heard them say something along the lines of \" if the earth I ruined, we can just terraform Mars\" or some other bullshit. No value placed in nature whatsoever. I can not find hope wherever I look. Help me.",

One point that he brought up is that humans are trying to save many species that are either too far gone or just so incompatible with the current stae of the earth that they simply will not survive without near-constant human intervention. I believe this is called \"conservation reliance.\" \n\nWhat do you think about this idea? Should we keep trying to save these species? Further, what do you think the goal of conservation to be? Is it to save all the species we can and actively keep them that way? ",
