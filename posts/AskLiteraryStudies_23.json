I was wondering if there are any examples of some experimental literature where the characters are depicted as having their own consciousness, separate from the narrative and trying to fight the author and his authority as the creator. What I mean by all of that is some very deep metafiction with many different narrative voices which seem to be at conflict with each other, breaking up at some points as some kind of a metaphor of resignation or anything similar. I'll be very glad for any suggestions : )",

For example, if novellas were published at all they usually accompanied a selection of stories because of the economics of paper publishing. Freed of these perceived consumer constraints, are new forms developing? Novellas seem to enjoy a popularity in English that hasn't been seen for years if at all.

It's difficult to put much trust in the writing subreddits.\n\nIn Hart Crane's work, I have noted that Crane owes certain imagery to earlier poets. In the Broken Tower,  off the top of my head, Crane's \"hived in the sun's rays\" traces to the opening of Marlowe's Dido. And Crane's \"knell of a spent day\" resembles the opening line of Thomas Gray's \"Elegy\". \n\nAs a hopeful poet myself, I feel a sort of apprehension about utilizing the images, words, or forms of other poets. I mention Crane because I have an affinity for his poetry. I have always felt close to the imagistic and Elizabethan tradition I read in Crane's works. In the poem I am working on, I use words found in the Broken Tower (specifically hive and cognate) as well as the form of the twelve 8 line stanzas of Atlantis. I feel I have good reason to, but being my first poem, the feeling I get is that I am unwelcome to make use of Crane's peculiar vocabulary or form despite its feeling natural for me to do so. \n\nMy question is this: If at all, how do these considerations generally enter into your evaluation of a poem?",

Whereas DeLillo has a bit stronger focus through consumption (particularly an American consumption), the Matrix looks at this notion (quite explicitly on multiple occasions) in relation to technology, computers, and the internet. Both of these bring light to the simulacrum, show what it can inhabit, but don't seem to offer what the act of acknowledging it actually does, or has done. It obviously is coded with a negative connotation, but beyond a societal implosion, is there any particular thing that we should do with the simulacrum, beyond? Rather than these works (and others, of course) only acknowledging them, do they actually suggest or do anything else? It seems, something that I'm guilty of as well, that sure, we can acknowledge its existence, but we willingly participate it anyway. Or does the notion of a postmodern \"lack of meaning\" just parallel this and act as an excuse to participate it in anyway? I'm trying to form an argument that goes beyond \"here's a simulacrum, here's another simulacrum, and another, etc.\" What is the moral up-shot? Is there one?\n\nAny help or further reading suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself” (sections 1-8, 16, 24);\n\nEmily Dickinson, a selection of poems – 435, 601, 613, 642, 657, 670, 1129;\n\nEdgar A.

You could see all the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No doubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the line, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was going to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he’d pull up drunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic accident…”\n\nWhich authors are most rigorous about showing rather than telling? \n\n",

Where a post modernist might might use these plotless narracts and loaded imagery to dismantle the processes of story telling and semiotics, Volodine seems to assert and insist upon a shamanistic, mystical world within the text, and the reader is complicit in the animation of that world.\n",

I'm not sure when it was written or even set, but I'm confident it was set in the last couple of decades.\n\nI remember the narrative revolved around an abuse relationship of a young man and woman. The segment of the text I was given was a portion where the man has sex with the woman in the bathroom of a bar while she's heavily intoxicated, and we discussed the nature of rape in relationships. \n\nI'm relatively confident we'd touched on the symbolism of their tattoo's, and that they'd lived in a trailer? \n\nI believe the novel ended with her leaving him, and being with another man.

        "text": "Hi all! Sorry about the length of this question -- the sum-up is at the end.\n\nI'm taking an excellent course on edX led by Gregory Nagy (Harvard), called The Ancient Greek Hero In 24 Hours. https://www.edx.org/course/ancient-greek-hero-24-hours-harvardx-hum2x-1. As it relates to Eliot, I recalled a passage in Little Gidding (my favorite poem) about words:\n\n... And every phrase \nAnd sentence that is right (where every word is at home, \nTaking its place to support the others,\nThe word neither diffident nor ostentatious,\nAn easy commerce of the old and the new,\nThe common word exact without vulgarity, \nThe formal word precise but not pedantic,\nThe complete consort dancing together)\nEvery phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning, \nEvery poem an epitaph.\n\nI subsequently read the Terry Fairchild essay \"Time, Eternity and Immortality in T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets\". From there I learned that in other parts of Four Quartets, Eliot was in part wondering about how long his words would be read in the future as a poet. This sort of self-referential stuff happens in Homer as well (as I've learned from Nagy), particularly when talking about things such as tombs -- the signposts of a preliterate culture. \n\nAlso, many of the words used in Homer have multiple meanings to them. I have learned, for example, that the word \"sema\" in Greek can not only refer to a tomb, but it can also serve as a definition of \"meaning\" ... or even refer to a turning post in a chariot race. So every word in Homer is also placed precisely.\n\nMy question: Because Eliot obviously knew his Greek history, I was wondering if his preoccupation with words and immortality in Four Quartets can be traced back in some way to Homer or at least, ancient Greek culture ... or if I'm reading too much into his text. I am also aware that \"the word\" could have a Christian meaning for Eliot, given his background. Thanks!",

I've noticed that because the book was written so sporadically and over such a long period of time, and because it seems Mark Twain put his opinions on society in the book through minor characters such as Colonel Sherburn and the residents in Colonel Sherburn's town, a picture can be created of the the American South in the 1830s through Mark Twain's eyes. It looks as if these opinions got harsher and harsher as the sections written later are read. In general he makes it look like a pretty nasty place to live. The amount of genuinely good people that come up in the story can be counted on two hands. Most characters Huck and Jim meet are not good people. How accurate was his portrayal of the poor white American South in the 1830s? If he showed society as worse than it was, why did he show it in that light?",

He states that the presence of an author's name is 'functional in that it serves as a means of classification'.\nFurthermore, he writes that the name of the author is 'unlike a proper name' in the sense that it 'remains at the contours of texts- separating one from the other, defining their form, and characterizing their form of existence.'\nSo, guys, what else am I missing from Foucault?\nHe goes on to say that the function of the author is to characterize the existence, the circulation, and operation of certain discourses within a society, listing four 'author functions'.\nBut I have a not-quite-so-sneaky feeling that I am missing something more.\nAny of you guys able to help?",
