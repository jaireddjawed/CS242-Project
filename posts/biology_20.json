The fact that they move so slow also supports this theory, as both factors would make them stealthy. This would also explain why they're able to catch fast prey. So, I'll restate my question: Is it reasonable to assume that the Greenland shark gained its dark skin color due to natural selection?",

        "text": "I know that anyone normal will read the title and presume that i am mad. I must confess that i wouldn't disagree with such an opinion, but please read me out.\n\nWhat i mean by this is a reflection, far broader than the title would imply, that being: Aren't we also animals? Aren't we also bound by natural processes that we would call natural selection? Aren't we also playing a role in our environment? And by that pressuring other species into extinction and making others thrive on our backs? \n\nAll this being postulated, how come is our selection 'artificial' ? Isn't the way we make some species change just a very complex way of doing what all living creatures have been doing since the the dawn of life on Planet Earth? With this i mean to say: We, being animals, are different by, for lack of a better word, being first to occupy the niche of \"Civilization', but that shouldn't imply that we are no longer animals, that we are no longer part of the animal kingdom, much less that we aren't playing our part and suffering the influences of Natural selection. Our brains don't make us stand above it just because we cant think about it.\n\nNow to the specifics, when humans in the neolithic first started gathering the ancestors of modern chickens, pigs, horses, cows, etc. And putting them inside fences and then, first probably by pure intuition, making the best breed more, or at least taking more care of the best, which made them have more chance to breed and pass their genes more often to the next generations. That was already changing the genetic pool of other species, and that thousands of years before humans could grasp what this 'evolution' could mean, and also thousands of year before this could be a giant change to the biosphere; In fact, human predation, using OP projectiles, meant back in the day far more to the grand scheme of things than these captured animals. The same can also be said about plants which we domesticated, maybe even to a further degree.\n\nNow with things like knowledge of genes and chemistry we can make a more efficient job in continuing what we already did, changing the species around us, but why should that be considered **in principle** different from the natural processes of gene survival that have been happening for billions of years before humans, and will continue to happen after we go away? I absolutely understand that it is a very very useful way of separating things, but still, shouldn't a more perfect conception of Evolution conceive that these are just new ways of a species changing its environment? Even if that species is us?\n\nthx for reading.",

So I've been having this cold for the past 3 days now, no flu or tiredness but the throat is making me feel very uncomfortable. You know the feeling like when you wake up in the morning and all of the sudden, you feel kind of grainy itchy in your throat, upper throat to be exact and you know you got a cold. \n\nSo I've been coughing non stop the past 2 days, my throat is congealed with phlegm and you know how annoying it is when you try to spit it out or swallow it down but it won't budge. I coughed til my chest feel painful and I actually got tired because of the cough, not the cold. \n\nBut then today, in the morning I was still coughing, and then when I was the least expecting, the cough just magically dwindled down. I didn't pay much attention but all of the sudden, I realised I wasn't coughing no more. That tingling ticklish sensation in my throat was almost becoming unnoticeable. That transition from morning coughing to afternoon quiet was nothing short of magical. And I know the whole time my body was fighting off the virus, little macrophages eating up infected cells, little dendritic cells were busy taking up antigens to present them to make antibody by little B cells. And all of these are happening in my body, and I know they have won the battle because the cold symptoms are going down by the minutes. I just think it's sort of incredible how the biology of us works, from the infection to the battle with mu immune system. The human body is amazing, even when I get to study how all of these works, it still amazes me to feel and to see it in action. \n\nTake care of your body like how it is taking care of you every minute!",

        "text": " Phytic Acid binds to Calcium, making it inabsorbable Calcium Phytate, this is what causes rickets, adding more Calcium cures rickets because it changes the Phytic Acid/Calcium balance. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392604/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392604/)\n\nAlso, apparently 79% of calcium absorption is passive (not dependant on Vitamin D): [https://www.jci.org/articles/view/113283](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/5/1426/4558607)\n\nWhy then would Vitamin D also cure rickets? Because Vitamin D increases Phytate digestibility a little bit, making some of the Calcium Phytate absorbable, whereas without Vitamin D, basically none of the Calcium Phytate can be digested and so basically none of the Calcium can be absorbed. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2996095/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2996095/) (It's a pig study, but it's the best I could find)\n\nDoes anyone know more about this, is my hypothesis correct? It's hard to find info on the digestibility/absorption of Phytic Acid/Phytate and how it interacts with Vitamin D.",

(I'm not) i ended up catching this cold\n\nShe didn't want to be close at all for the week that she was sick because she didnt want me to get sick and then give it back to her which i thought was ridiculous, as far as i'm aware once you build an immunity after becomming ill, you are now immune to that strain or \"brand\"? Am i wrong?\n\nI understand that these viruses/bacteria can mutate or evolve but i remember learning that it also takes significant time for that to happen, not just a few days. \n\nI feel as though she caught a seperate bug or something but im not sure and i don't want to be an asshole and tell her that's not how it works if i can't even explain it to her.\n\nI wanted an Eli5 answer on how this works but they don't take human biology questions there.\n\nPlease help",
