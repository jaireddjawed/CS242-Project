Democracy is slowly breaking down because it's being associated with a government that does not give its citizens any ideals to live by, the youth are encountering mass depression rates, consumerism and globalism are completely taking over, and no one can have subjective opinions about anything anymore. The world has become too complex in all directions.\n\nWhat we see from China and Russia I think is only the beginning to a long existential battle. The West will lose its dominance and the economic dominance will then be (probably) gained by Autocratic Eastern Regimes.   \n\n\nBut on the focus of the West, there is more and more support for outsider politicians, draining the swamp rhetoric, eliminating career politicians, and supporting a one man, fix everything type politician. This is typically how all autocratic regimes start throughout the centuries of human history and revolving stereotype of how history always repeats itself.   \n\n\nDemocracy has already been attempted long ago in the West but generally falls apart at around the 300 year mark. Throughout the entirety of some 10,000 years of human civilization under Governments, the majority has been under Autocrats. Whether it's the West or the Eastern part of the world, Whether the Ancient Assyrians, Egyptians, Roman Empire, Greek Empire, Asian Dynasties, etc. Republics fall into Autocracy and Democracies fall into Autocracy.   \n\n\nI think within the next 30 or so years, Democracy will fall into Dynasties, Monarchies, etc again. Not just in America, but throughout the world. I really don't see the world as having the energy to support democracies and republics in the future ahead.  \n\n\nWhat are your opinions?",

As an experiment in AI-generated art, I asked Chat GPT to write 105 titles and asked it to write a poem around 200 words for each one. The result is a unique collection of poems that explore a wide range of themes and emotions.\n\nWhile the poems are technically written by a machine, I believe they still possess a certain level of beauty and depth. They offer a fascinating glimpse into what AI is capable of and raise questions about the nature of creativity and art.\n\nIf you're curious to check it out, the book is available on Amazon. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it and whether you think AI-generated art has a place in the literary world.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Some of the latter might have already happened or been just averted.\n\nI am talking from a background in SW engineering with some knowledge in artificial intelligence but by no means consider myself an expert in the area so I would like to hear from the smarter peoples it there what your educated opinions about this are.

        "text": "In the not-too-distant future, cities will be transformed by shared autonomous electric vehicles, electric minibuses, and vastly improved public transit. The undeniable truth is that cars driven alone are inefficient, wasteful, and costly, leading to debt slavery for millions. It's time for change, and a shift towards shared transportation is the solution we need.\n\nImagine a world where our streets are no longer choked with traffic, where the air is cleaner, and where we have the freedom to move without the burden of car ownership. The transition to a post-car dominated world is not only essential for the health and well-being of our cities, but it will also result in trillions of dollars of urban real estate being freed up for redevelopment.\n\nSprawl, McMansions, and cars are relics of the past, and we must embrace a new future that prioritizes shared transportation, bikes, scooters, and walking. This is not just a matter of convenience, but a moral obligation to future generations.\n\nSo let's be bold and take the necessary steps to make this transition a reality. Let's embrace the shared autonomous EV robotaxis, electric minibuses, and vastly improved public transit that will bring new vibrancy and prosperity to cities around the globe. The future is now, and we must seize it.\n\nIn addition to the environmental and economic benefits of a post-car dominated world, there is also a pressing need to address the obesity crisis that is plaguing many communities around the globe. Our current community design, which encourages sedentary lifestyles and car-dependent transportation, has contributed to this problem.\n\nBut with the transition to shared autonomous EVs, electric minibuses, and improved public transit, we have an opportunity to create healthier and more active communities. By prioritizing walking, biking, and public transportation, we can reduce our reliance on cars and encourage more physical activity in our daily lives.\n\nAugmented reality glasses may also play a role in helping us break away from our sedentary habits. By immersing ourselves in a virtual world, we can reduce our dependence on screens and engage in more active and immersive experiences.\n\nSo let's embrace the transition to a post-car world, not only for the environmental and economic benefits but also for the health and well-being of our communities. Together, we can create a future that is both sustainable and healthy for all.",

        "text": "**Part One: Time**\n\nI am reminded of an issue H.G. Wells had with the British educational and governmental systems around 1910. His issue was simple: it took these systems 30 years, on average, to update to the cutting-edge scientific and otherwise advancements. Naturally, this annoyed Wells beyond measure.\n\nI have always taken issue with Wells' statement. He made a few grave errors, one of which being the matter of *time*. The British could only update/self-update so fast. It took time -- years -- to do that, as it took years to build, re-build, and re-build New York City, for example. But, more importantly, it requires a certain amount of time for the entire society and culture to remain stable and properly connected between the generations, sub-groups, and sub-systems during such updates, regardless of the type of update (digital, cultural, or structural, etc.). \n\nWe must all realise that 6 months is too soon for such an update in education or otherwise, for that matter. Indeed, I am now reminded of how the U.S. stopped itself from making any major decisions in the months following 9/11. I believe the period was 6 months, this implying that they had the *wisdom* to know that they could not trust themselves to make any kind of logical or correct decision before this time. They were too emotional, and maybe simply did not have enough information to properly act, or act properly.\n\nDo we, in 2023, not have too much information? Are we not, as Huxley foresaw back in 1950, *drowning in a sea of information?* And, even if we claim, for a moment, that we have the *correct* amount of information we need -- and, indeed, the correct information -- for instant actions and reactions on scales great and small, are we any less emotional today than we were in 2001, or 1910? I think not. Have human brains changed in any fundamental/biological way since then? No. We still require time to mentally, emotionally, and physically process, properly process, information and stimuli, and then to integrate that into our wider frameworks, cultures, sub-systems, and even identities (both interpersonal and intrapersonal).\n\nYes, for the sake of argument, we can all agree that 30 years is *too long*. Alas, this begs the question: by how much? Is 15 years enough, or maybe 5? What about 18 months?\n\nWe know that information was doubling around every 18 months for some time (back in the 1980s), and it now doubles almost instantly. But, that is not the primary point or worry: what matters is how quickly it impacts and mistreats culture and humanity -- and, how quickly we mistreat ourselves. What matters is how quickly culture is forced to twist and distort itself into some new shape, until art imitates life, and life imitates art... only, both the art and the life are artificial and vapid. All of this talk of time and the back and forth of it all brings a pang, and a vision. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Makes me think of the vision scene from Watchmen, and the hands of nothingness, and Shakespeare...\n\n*'... Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,*  \n*That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,*  \n*And then is heard no more. It is a tale*  \n*Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,*  \n*Signifying nothing.'*\n\nSpeak of the devil -- just download TikTok for proof of this madness. Then, instantly delete it from your phone, because if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will notice that TikTok has access to your iPhone's information and collects data from other websites/apps on your phone, even if you don't open TikTok itself. It has major access to your phone -- meaning, your digital life -- simply via the download. They use this data to further hone their own systems, and to feed back into TiKTok how they desire, based on your apps, search history, and personal information. The data collected from each person is then locally gathered on their end, which becomes a very powerful dataset (akin to what Facebook does). I call these processes, '*echo-chambering*' (it's not merely 'ad suggestions'), and '*personality-mining*' (it's not merely 'data-mining'). TikTok should be illegal beyond measure, and many states/governments are trying to ban TikTok for this very reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part Two: Steam Culture**\n\nAlan Moore, in his 2005 documentary, Mindscape, spoke of a likely 'steam culture' to rise out of the overload of information and technology as it intersects with culture and individuals in unspeakable ways. He said this would come by 2015. He was right. A culture where it's impossible to grab onto anything, impossible to stabilise ourselves, impossible to know what is truth and untruth. He was merely looking ahead 10 years, lest we forget. He said (this is a direct transcript):\n\n*'... As  it turns out after the first 50,000 year period, the second period is  about 1500 years, say about the time of the Renaissance, by then we have  twice as much information. To double again, human information took a  couple hundred years. The period speeds up, between 1960 and 1970 human  information doubled. As I understand it, at last count, human information was doubling around every 18 months. Further to  this, there is a point somewhere around 2015 where human information is  doubling everything thousandth of a second. This means in each  thousandth of a second, we will have accumulated more information than  we have in the entire previous history of the world. At this point I  believe that all bets are off. I cannot imagine the kind of culture that  might exist after such a flashpoint of knowledge. I believe that our  culture would probably move into a completely different state, would  move past the boiling point from a fluid culture, to a culture of  steam.'* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part Three: The Evidence, Now and Henceforth**\n\nWe have, as of 2023:\n\n\\- Self-driving cars;\n\n\\- Weaponised/politicised A.I. ChatGPT;\n\n\\- Open A.I., which can, among other things, write and then accurately grade your university project within seconds;\n\n\\- A.I. artists;\n\n\\- Semi-advanced robots;\n\n\\- Very controlling A.I. algorithm network structures (social media);\n\n\\- Advanced 'deepfakes' (A.I. humanoids);\n\n\\- A.I. voices;\n\n\\- A.I. (Chat) writers;\n\n\\- Hyper-advanced computing machines, factory machines, and creator machines (for all sorts of jobs/tasks); \n\n\\- Gene-editing machines/tech;\n\n\\- Overload of information -- images, text/words, video, etc. -- via iPhones (for all young humans in the West, at least);\n\n\\- Major control of our thinking and beliefs via the likes of Amazon Alexa (and most of its answers come from Wiki or other heavily inaccurate/untrustworthy, singular Internet sources). (The same is true when you simply ask your iPhone something via voice.)\n\n\\- A.I. deepfake porn;\n\n\\- A.I. music.\n\nAnd more.  \n\n\nI just read through Reddit's latest terms and settings in this regard, and it said that it has access to all my (your) private inboxes. They record everything you send, even when said in private. There is no such thing as 'private' anymore on the Internet -- unless you happen to find a blockchain or otherwise entity that actually is private in some way. This is just for 2023. I am certain that Reddit will be unworkable for 80% of users by 2035 if this carries on, this unholy trinity: censorship; political correctness; and data-mining/theft. The unholy trinity is what gives birth to the echo-chambering and personality-mining, which inturn gives birth to the *eternal* *now*.\n\nImagine how all of this might impact something outside the realm of A.I. in the near future. Imagine what actors might be like... A.I. actors. They already replace real actors when needed (if they are dead, or via so-called 'digital doubles'/A.I. stunt doubles). I'm not even certain movies will still exist as we currently understand them by 2040. (Though, Jet Li had the wisdom to deny *The Matrix Reloaded (2003)* back in 2000 or so, since they wanted to scan him and store him as a digital actor in order to create the movie, but Jet was worried that this would give them the power and right to use him as a complete digital actor without his permission in the future, or after his death). They already did this with Peter Cushing in the new Star Wars. I don't trust anybody who creates such and/or supports making these fully-realised fake A.I. versions of dead actors, such as they did in Star Wars. It's shameful, disgusting, unethical, and lacking in basic humanity and art (since it's not a real actor with real emotion and soul, and is inability of being art or creating art in any real way. By definition, art must be man-made (though there are examples of 'art' in the animal kingdom, these are entirely for sexual selection purposes, and still driven by living beings with actual intention/proto-emotion, such as bowerbirds and chimps)).\n\nI declare that robots and A.I. are not actually real. If you treat them as actually real, then humans become meaningless under this rubric. The moment A.I. is considered artistic, for example, it must be considered humanoid in some fundamental way -- or, worse, humans must be considered robotic in nature (as is already a growing trend), as you have to at some point deeply liken the two (human and A.I.).\n\nAlthough, (say) ChatGPT is mostly a matter of the coders, not just the code and raw data, we also know that A.I. can now improve itself, and A.I. makes choices outside the coding to such a degree that coders cannot understand how the A.I. came to those choices/conclusions (making the A.I. smarter than the human coder himself, in a certain sense -- and beyond his direct control). It has already begun to be self-aware enough to self-create outside its source code. Following this, it won't be many more years until it's a 'runaway A.I.' (snowball effect), and completely outside of our control, as it rapidly grows itself and creates other A.I. systems by itself (self-creates, not merely self-teaches), and no longer at all obeys human coding. This might not be 'true' self-awareness, but this is moot. It does not have to be. It just has to be free and/or powerful enough to cause downfall for human society, regardless of its means, intentions, and/or understanding, or lack thereof.\n\nLest we forget, Skynet from Terminator began as no more than a virus system (piece of code), that rapidly grew out of control, and then turned against humanity, because humans were (a) bad for the planet; and/or (b) imperfect creations. I see no reason why Skynet is impossible under the current state of affairs. (Another decent look into this, by the way, is *Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),* or even Smith from *The Matrix (1999).* For decades both of these metrics have been over-filled: humans have long desired perfection, and we are endlessly told how evil we are for the planet. In fact, many papers and otherwise documents have come out over recent years, demanding that humans get rid of themselves by some means, such as from the work of David Benatar, and the 'Ahuman Manifesto' from 2020, written by a professor at Cambridge, England.) \n\nThe anti-human hatred by humans ourselves is the primary problem we must deal with over the next few decades, not just the rise of A.I. itself (or, even the mere fact of too much information, big tech, and so on). I believe, we are going to a Terminator-like future because of our self-hatred, because of our desire to, as opposed to our love for machines, or else machines' hatred. To the degree that machines and A.I. hate us (measured primarily in their actions/outcomes) -- *we* have taught them to. Think about that.  \n\n\nBy around 2035, it is widely understood (by the likes of Tristan Harris and other world-class experts on these subjects) that we'll have:\n\n\\- Totalitarian A.I. algorithm network structures, globally (meaning, Meta/Facebook, Google, Disney, Amazon, and Twitter, etc. will control, invent, edit, and dictate almost all human information, entertainment, and knowledge);\n\n\\- Gene-editing tools in the home (personal usage/open source);\n\n\\- Hyper-advanced A.I. systems and networks that allow each person to create their own piece of the Internet and social media platforms, etc. (since, soon (as early as 2025), these A.I. chats and related A.I. systems will be capable of inventing their own social media networks). In fact, they will be able to create -- for you -- many man-made things, including essays, novels, and legal documents. If this is Open Source for everybody's computer/phone, then this means each person online will be free and able to actively control and shape culture/society in real-time. (This is feared by governments, many A.I. experts, and the likes of Musk to be coming down the pipeline as early as 2030.);\n\n\\- Extreme automation and mechanisation of society (not just of cars and various desk workers and factory workers, but also many lawyers and other serious jobs may be replaced by A.I. and robots, for example);\n\n\\- Deepfake tech will reach a point where it's easy to make and hyper-realistic, with a focus on 'hologram' tech via special cameras, which opens up more possibilities for fakes. (We just saw the start of this with the deepfake Elvis on AGT.);\n\n\\- Social media interface lenses and/or brain chips;\n\n\\- Realistic, hyper-connected Metaverse -- social VR space (like what Facebook is currently trying to do);\n\n\\- Hyper-advanced A.I. Chat at home (on your phone);\n\n\\- A.I. will be better than humans at many tasks and games (such as Go);\n\n\\- A.I. will have largely (though not completely, without major advancements in computing) solved the game of Chess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's just the short-term, and we only scratched the surface in terms of actual cultural and personal negative impacts of such a flashpoint of knowledge and technology. This may not be enough to literally create Terminators (big, silver, killer robots) or lead to complete downfall (end of the world-level Skynet imagery), but it's easily enough for Western society to collapse under its own weight --- the chaos, economic struggle, mass depression, self-hatred, mass addiction, total confusion, national mistrust, educational breakdown, and endless in-fighting.\n\nYou could, if you really tried, convince me that society will somewhat stabilise by 2035 if we do things right, rendering most of this moot in the short-term (at least at such scales). But, it seems unavoidable for such a downfall by 2045 or beyond. Something extremely radical would have to change in order to stop the slow rise of the machines/A.I. Personally, I believe Moore was correct, and we already saw such a flashpoint back in 2014 (which can be backed up heavily by the likes of Jonathan Haidt and his findings on Gen-Z and wider culture). Indeed, so terrible and actually dangerous is this state of affairs that Haidt demands that modern phones (social media, etc.) be completely removed from all children until the age of about 16. (This is a growing concern and action is being taken in this direction by many parents and governing bodies alike, though Haidt is still the forerunner.)\n\nThis is the primary reason I am almost completely anti-A.I. and seriously anti-social media, among other things: it's unavoidable. I believe, as a result, that the only way for humans to remain both free and stable, long-term, is in a more localised (township), traditional (pre-1990s) framework; otherwise, the West will sink by the end of this century (2099), according to all current major studies, trends, and predictive models. \n\n*Do not despair.* Do your best in your own town and home, for yourself and those around you. Use the Internet to its best, and reject the filthy underbelly. Say what you think, speak as clearly as you can, and act out what you believe in, for good action lead to good culture and people. And, people are the why.\n\n*'He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.' - Nietzsche*",

The response then has often been, well at least blue collar jobs will be thriving, but I question how?\n\n\\- You will get increased competition as there is a lot of people who got nothing better to do.\n\n\\- If there is no white collar work that also means no offices, that is a massive amount of potential work that is just gone.\n\n\\- If no one has any money, how exactly are they going to pay for your services.\n\nSo I guess I do not understand this thinking that blue collar work will be fine and that the simplistic view that blue collar and white collar are these separate worlds that has no effect on each other. \n\nOnly work I see that will be fine will be nurses, special needs assistants etc, that is literally it. I would say day care as well but if everyone is unemployed who is sending their kids to day care?",

Subsequently it will replace it’s own creators, Computer Scientists/ML Engineers.\n\nWhat I don’t understand is that how will other jobs not be replaced as well. Isn’t it a paradox? Like if AI replace Computer Scientists, then it means AI must be creative and super smart =&gt; If AI is creative and smart, then it can evolve alone and become better =&gt; If AI evolves alone, then no job is safe.\n\nMy question comes from a discussion with a graphic designer and a Mechanical Engineer. They were saying AI will replace Computer Scientists way before many other jobs, so their jobs (Graphic Design and Mechanical Engineering) are safer than Computer Scientists.

        "text": "Quick definition for those who don't know: \"business as usual\" in this context means thinking that the future will look largely the same as today with some generational improvements - faster computers, thinner smartphones, more efficient planes, SUVs which now take two lanes instead of one etc. Basically it's a viewpoint stemming from the assumption that no big change will take place in the foreseeable future.\n\nLet me bring up some general examples from comments on this sub first \\[square brackets contain general topic\\] (brackets contain explanations when needed):\n\n* \\[lifespan extension\\] I don't want to work for 200 years before retiring.\n* \\[lifespan extension\\] I just want to be healthy longer but I don't want to live longer. (user saying this assumes that death coping like \"death is natural part of life\" etc. is natural and that they'll want to die at eg. age of 80 and not be allowed to)\n* \\[automation\\] How can I live if there is no way for me to make money because there is no jobs?\n* \\[automation\\] My job is too hard to be automated.\n* \\[generative AI\\] AI will kill human creativity. (user assumes that human creativity will disappear if there is no monetary incentive)\n* \\[generative AI\\] I will always recognise AI art.\n\nAll of those are statements are short sighted when looking at the whole picture and disappointing when considering that this is supposed to be future focused sub. I am not saying that I am better at predicting future than you or that you should be blindly optimistic (some may classify my critique as something stemming from optimism, I consider myself a realist) but being blindly pessimistic or ignorant of many things changing simultanously isn't the way either.",
