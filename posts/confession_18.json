I can't live with myself anymore and I'm constantly looking for a way to better myself but sometimes I feel like I must be punished. I get a strong urge to chop off my ring finger. I hurt her in a way that I will never forgive myself and makes me doubt if I will ever be able to love someone again. \n\nI always had grandiose dreams of marriage, a family, a peaceful life. But I'm fucked up. I made a mistake I can't take back. I can't fix what I've done.",

Pause! and I'll hear them go \"Well what the hell?!

I can even do it from inside my car out in the driveway! This has been going on for years and so far they haven't connected the Netflix issues  to my presence at their house. Bahahahahaha",

The FBI showed up to my house yesterday and informed me they had evidence i was a victim of “sextortion” \n\nI had completely blocked this time period out of my head until she told me what it was. Due to Child molestation and i have a hard time remembering traumatic events. \n \nLong story short I was a dumb 15 year old at the time and was careless about what i sent to people. In September of 2019 (I had just turned 15 the week before) i was messaged by an account asking if i remembered them. After i said no i was sent the school i attended, my address, and names of family and friends. I was threatened that if i didn’t send this person more photos my life would be completely ruined. I was terrified of this for about 2 months before i finally blocked the account and decided i didn’t care if they got sent out. \n\nThe FBI informed me this was a nationwide sextortion scheme. The Man had done this to 1,100 known girls, all of which were under the age of 16 and had stated so to him.  He was sentenced to 43 years in prison and life on parole. They still have not identified all of the victims, and i may have to identify nude photos of myself. \n\nI have a history of bad mental and i’m not sleeping and i can feel myself going down the drain because of this. All the emotions i felt then are flooding back in full swing. I never thought this could happen to me. I don’t know how to deal with this.",

        "text": "I am a highest level license social worker, I work with suicidal teens now but have found every mental illness including every suicide attempt- is a result of a traceable narcissistic injury \n\nI now basically try to help kids develop their own identity and clear gaslighting.  I also deal with my mom, sons mom, and ex who are all psychopaths of varying degrees but mostly covert malignant, the last ex overt malignant helped me discover this stuff and changed my practice in mental health.  I literally contact old patients and tell them I was wrong and they aren’t crazy. \n\nToday I think I may have lost one to gaslighting .. 16 .. I do think they are solid in their own story that whatever led to their gaslighter leaving me a vm that they are “uncomfortable” (narcs love to throw that word at men because it means nothing legally but leaves feelings of concern of sexual or physical abuse to the listener.  They have an innate sense on throwing out lies the logical mind processes as unfounded or not worth attention but the unconscious and especially subconscious remain screaming “DANGER WITH THIS ONE” this is their parasitic deceptive nature and why no contact is the only option, ****they talk to your unconscious mind directly without your knowledge****)\n——— I do have faith this one knows the truth because they knew at under 10 years old things shouldn’t have been their fault to the entire family all the time to the point of hours long scolding’s and isolation through tears for “making mom stressed when she does everything for you” .. and on my end  “your therapist is going to be mad at you for attempting suicide” plus about 10 other layers that are too detailed to share but make this 1000x more degrading to the kid when they find out the truth about their upbringing \n\nSo that was my first text of the day 😂 \n\nTalked to my narc ex who shows my son sitting rigid painting …for her second day with him this week … he’s silent, just murmurs “hey can I stay at mommy’s” (the only thing he ever says on FaceTime there and he never asks for her here)\n\nFirst patient, former cps worker in my ex’s city who grew up in a harsh narc home and was the eternal scapegoat since birth upon layers of family, mom came in to a session and hadn’t seen the patient in a decade ……  mom bitched at patient (I’m gonna start calling patients P) for not being grateful. \n - proceeded to tell me what a great mom she is and how P was worthless since 5 … this is given to show context that I’m not blshitting - today was just normal narc processing and reattaching P inner voice to self rather than conforming to external programmed demands and ways of presenting or existing … I spend most of the time being confrontational with self dialogue gaslights, I praise Ps accomplishments and little decisions. \n\nSecond one- I forgot they are on vacation - family and gf deep narc, family hangs out with their ex who cheated on P while P was in the hospital for suicide attempt and the hour P discharged FaceTimes then no clothes from the other persons bed, dumps P, told P they didn’t have sex with the other person they are currently sleeping next to naked during the breakup … was the girl who was a friend and she was crazy for worrying about.  \nThe persons own Family blames them.  Still talk to and have dinner with the ex, the exs mail still comes to the family home and family tells my patient to shut up about it and stop whining. \nPs new gf first week slept in a bed with a tinder date after leaving her mid night, of course just cuddling - refuses to process it, creates insecurities in P constantly.. P knows this is true and can’t free themself  \n\nNext one Ended up convinced to work next to narcmom in moms career and mom used the patient’s workplace to degrade the client and criticize the patient far into adulthood …. Never had intimate relations due to parental stamping and harassing as disgusting bad and selfish when exploration indicated as teen … guilted to remain serving emotional needs at home … I’ve been begging the patient to escape and showing her how necessary it is, cannot click.. freeze and default mind escape activities ensue… I catch a deep empathy glance to see her raw emotional consciousness and default to validating her choices that come from her inner voice only and confronting those that come from expectations of others. \n\nNext one I’ll skip narc dad \n\nNext one another kiddo says parent rejects them and is not in the home blaming them being too annoying.., P given meeting time and offer to recant, does defensively- i can feel narcdad potentially camoflouging under social pressure because he checks when shifting tones expressions and attitudes rather than having authenticity in them but maybe I’m wrong … I offer him one month to correct what he’s done and show initiative that he is concerned about his kids emotions and want to meet back to see what actions were implemented to amend the emotional damage the child states they have.  I strongly advocate for the family to shut up and I’m rude and confrontational during the times the child is asked to share their voice and parent tries to interrupt or make excuses.\n\nNext one another kiddo who has been adulting like chores siblings school sports doctors therapy etc entirely alone since middle school.  No adult in home and cps approved .. P was the adult in 7h grade …I try to process Ps  emotions because it’s causing anxiety related symptoms making Ps life functioning impaired moderately .. P argues with me and self gaslights ti maintain equilibrium .. I encourage P to engage in self care and try to be agreeable\n\nI get out and call back a parent who I see his kid and realized I got gaslit to this kid being institutionalized by the other parent… repeat for the second time how I see it now ..: he forgot what we talked about but in a suppressive way (he thinks the convo was about some other detail despite being shocked and speechless at the time) \n\n\n👁️🕳️🖤 🕳️👁️\n\n- 💀 Narc Reaper 💀 -",

        "text": "I work at a pretty nice hotel, but there are a few people who will come through and absolutely trash the place. I understand wanting to have a good time, but when there’s feces all over the toilet and nicotine gum stuck EVERYWHERE I will not be chill about it. Anytime I find a room that’s really bad like this I’ll just take anything that was left in the room. Usually we bag and tag the items and wait 3 months to see if they’ll try to get the item back. Nah, if they were messy or disgusting I take it all. Nice looking pair of beats headphones? Whoops, I’ve never seen them in my life. A pair of cute pjs? Fuck it, I’ll find someone who needs this size. It’s all mine. And fuck you for leaving your hotel room trashed. Literally doesn’t have to be much, just put all your trash in one area and make sure bodily fluids make it into their respective areas.",

He wasn't incorrect in that statement. He was a douchebag, yes, but he wasn't factually incorrect. \n\nWhile watching Wall Street or other movies where rich people take advantage of gullible poor people, I don't automatically think that the rich people are wrong for it. I think that the poor people are at least partially to blame for being so gullible. \n\nI've even bought a \"Thanos Was Right\" travel mug for myself. Anyone who sees it may think it's a joke but, to me, it's both humorous, but also reflects my feelings on a lot of movies. The bad guy almost always has a valid point.",
