And I didn't think such, \"wormholes\", _if_ they even actually existed on the quantum scale, would be the same thing as the theoretical wormholes of GR, but rather something conceptually similar.  \n\nNow it seems that, not only has work been done on the math, but that the math of quantum entanglement is logically equivalent to the math of a wormhole better two blackholes.  At least, that's what he says in the video.  But I don't get how that could be the case -- we know quantum entanglement is a real thing, as it's been experimentally demonstrated multiple times (although, AFAIK, it's not clear whether it happens with individual particles or if it's an emergent property of large groups of particles) it's not entirely ckear, but, AFAIK, most physicists think actual wormholes are impossible because they'd require negative mass.  \n\nThoughts?",

I want to understand why this is physically possible and generally accepted.\n\nMany times I have heard \"photons are massless\" used as a foundational argument for a greater theory. To my knowledge photons *do* have mass, just an extremely small amount. How can it be that a particle (in this example) can have mass *and* travel at the speed of light?\n\nWe know light has mass because it is affected by gravity. Albeit, it takes **a lot** of gravity to affect light significantly, but nonetheless it *is* affected. I'm aware of the principle that light travels at different speeds through different mediums, so assume it's traveling through a vacuum for the sake of argument.\n\nDoes light *really* travel at c? If not, what does c truly represent and where was it derived from? If it does, how is it possible given its mass?\n\nThanks.",

What if the transferring of light on the quantum level causes a small amount of friction that's able to transfer it's information it's holding , move a quantum particle, give it energy or, heat it up make it hotter giving it pressure, friction, velocity and, mass therefore creating a small amount of gravity from the equal or opposite reaction. Now this closed loop is a way for the universe to transfer light, information and, smaller amounts of mass quickly (at the speed of light). It also allows it to update visually really well like hitting a bunch Cueball's over and over again at the speed of light or faster so the energy is never destroyed just reused and, transferred instant and simultaneously. Now thisnew mass creates a small amount of gravity and quantum particles and, builds it up in the universe over years and, years always combining with itself causing different types of reactions creating different things.  \n\n\nWhat do you guys think of this theory?

When rolling a die, for example, it is impossible to predict what number will come up. It is important to note, however, that randomness is not inherent in the process. A dice roll obeys the laws of mechanics and can be predicted if the initial conditions are known precisely and computing power is sufficient. Similarly, when a computer chooses an option at random, the numbers remain deterministic because they are generated using a seed value, which is required to initialize the algorithm. If the same seed value is used, the same sequence of \"random\" numbers will be generated. While this is adequate for some applications, the outcome can be predicted if the seed value and algorithm are known. Processes that follow precise laws are referred to as deterministic.\n\nLaplace famously stated that if an intelligence had complete knowledge of the universe at a given instant and knew the laws of nature, it would be able to predict all future and past events. This means that everything we do in life, including you reading this text, is determined by the initial conditions of the universe.\n\nLater, physicists discovered quantum phenomena, which are fundamentally random and involve elementary particles such as electrons and photons. No matter how much we know about the initial conditions, the outcome of these processes cannot be predicted. However, quantum phenomena exist only at the microscopic level and have no effect on processes at the human scale.\n\nHere's where our website comes in. Quantum random number generators use the inherent randomness of quantum processes to generate a sequence of random numbers that cannot be predicted. We use this to quantum randomly select one of the options you enter, allowing you to bring quantum randomness to the macroscopic scale and theoretically enjoy experiences and memories that are truly free of determinism.\n\nIf you want to give it a try, we would be delighted!

        "text": "Physicists of reddit. I'm a computer scientist that recently got interested in physics and from some sources online (also reading through Einstein's book on relativity but haven't reached general relativity yet) I got the idea that gravity rather than being a force, is the curvature of space-time.\n\nIf so, why do physicists talk about looking for the graviton? Is it necessary for explaining the said curvature? Can't it be equivalent to a pseudo force like the centrifugal force instead of being a fundamental force like the strong force, etc.?\n\nAm I wrong in my idea of gravity? Or am I wrong about what looking for gravitons means? Because I can't see the 2 ideas being consistent with each other based on my idea of the two.",

Is it supposed to be something groundbreaking? Like, not even my professor who specialises in GR have heard of this work. \n\nIf we are able to arrive at special relativity with basic quantum principles, then is it a far leap to arrive at general relativity ( I have not taken a formal course in GR yet, but am looking to in the future)? And if so, what is the main issue between GR and QM? Apologies if my question sounds dumb.\n\nThank you for taking the time to answer this.",

        "text": "We can test how much force a person standing at the equator would feel due to the Earth's rotation. The force that we will be considering is called centrifugal force, which is the force that acts on objects and tends to push them away from the center of rotation. We can use a formula to calculate this force, which is:\n\nF = m * v^2 / r\n\n* F is what we’re solving for. It’s the centrifugal force, in Newtons.\n* M is mass in kilograms so for this example it’s a person weighing 81.65kg (180lbs)\n* V is the angular velocity of the object’s rotation, in radians per second. A radian sounds complex but it’s really just the radius of a circle wrapped around the outside of the circle. This always equates to 57.3 degrees of the 365 degree circle. Someone standing at the equator would have an angular velocity of about .0000701 radians per second due to the earth’s rotation. \n* r is the radius of the circle made by the rotation around a central point. The radius of the earth at the equator is about 6377km. \n\nLet’s plug in our numbers and see what the equation looks like: \n\nF = 81.65kg * (0.0000701 rad/s)^2 * 6377km\n\nWe can continue to solve and simplify according to orders of operation. \n\n= 81.65kg * 4.95e-12 rad^2/s^2 * 6377km\n\n= 2.74 N\n\n1 Newton is equivalent to about 0.2248 pounds, so the centrifugal force is equivalent to about 0.62 pounds. We can conclude it’s not reasonable to believe a 180lb person would be impacted or even notice the centrifugal force from the rotation of the earth if they were standing at the equator. \n\nKeep in mind that this equation is used to calculate the force exerted by a wide variety of things in industry such as centrifuges, pumps, governors, clutches, even merry-go-rounds. You can use it to calculate the centrifugal force on any object that spins around a central point.",

I recently graduated with my bachelors in applied physics, and have started getting involved in the job market to build relevant experience and learn new abilities. I went to my first real job interview the other day, I matched the credentials really closely, and the position appeared open to entry level candidates. When I got to the interview, I was met with pretty detailed questions, some entry level stuff and some higher level course stuff aswell. The interview was definetly structured around quick recall, and quickly became overwhelming for me. I performed exceptionally in college, and even managed to graduate second best at my university. The interview did not go over well in my eyes, as some of the content had referenced courses I had taken over a year ago, and my memory does not function to recall specific theory or equations at a moments notice. The entire time I was in school I was always taught and directed towards utilizing availible resources and reference material to problem solve. It felt like my first real exam without a formula sheet if that makes sense. I want to get some advice from old heads aswell as successful graduates in the job market. Is there something I did wrong here, or is this just standard interview process? Everything they had asked I would've only needed five minutes with Google or notes to recall and implement effectively, my ability is there, I just can't perform well with these quick recall focused interview questions. I feel gutted to be honest, and would appreciate constructive feedback or a relatable experience, thanks!",
