        "text": "What first inspired this question was [this PragerU video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcy7qV-BGF4) claiming Slavery was the cause of the American Civil War, and [this rebuttal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPOnL-PZeCc) claiming it definitely was not. While I like both videos, I think they each go short of much bolder claims - either that the American Civil War would not have occurred had Slavery not been an issue, or that the war still would have occurred, just at a later date. For the latter case, one would need to speculate exactly how much later, likely using some metric for the building tensions in the decades preceding the war, and extrapolating when those issues would've come to a head. If you watch both videos, I feel it's pretty undeniable that Slavery influenced the war, hence my disinterest in their respective thesis statements. \n\nEDIT: I picked this sub deliberately, as /r/AskHistory has a strict automoderator and this would easily get reported for controversy, and /r/AskHistorians has a much stricter requirement on primary and secondary sources, of which I have none.\n\nEDIT2: Going further on the respective questions - If you're a pessimist towards the North, you'd say they were pushing a tyrannical agenda. If you're an optimist towards the South you'd say states rights, and a pessimist you'd say pro-slavery. Really makes me wonder what correlation we'd see between a large quantity/variety of historic analyses, and their respective biographies. Does anyone write both optimistic narratives or both pessimistic narratives at the same time? Would it even be that cohesive of a paper?",

        "text": "I've asked this question before on /r/AskHistorians but it always gets ignored so I thought I'd bring it here.\n\nI theorize that one of the reasons that ancient Native American societies weren't as advanced in technology in certain aspects than old world civilizations was because they didn't trade and interact with other civilizations in the Americans on a scale as large as the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Europe. A lot of the societies were hunter-gatherer people, but still, some of them had cities larger than their old world counterparts at their height. I think it's more understandable for people living in areas with harsh terrains but there's even evidence of people of the American Southwest surrounded by deserts trading with those in Mesoamerica with huge jungles surrounding them, but even then, other places in the Americas don't have those kinds of obstacles surrounding them and offer temperate climates and easily navigatable terrains so it seems to me like they could have interacted more and thus traded ideas and concepts that would have allowed their people to advance in science and cultural aspects akin to other people. I can assume that they had an interest in science. Afterall, the Native Americans had a sophisticated understanding of selective breeding and we can see that with the way they were able to farm vegetables like corn that originated from a type of wild grass. Is there a known reasoning as to why people of pre-Columbian America weren't interacting with one another on as large as a scale as their old world counterparts or am I completely wrong in my assumptions?
