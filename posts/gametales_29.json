        "text": "**Members**  \nGylian, Goliath Paladin  \nEriden Stryd, Human Ranger  \nAsh Greyborn, Genasi Ranger  \nMisdir, Elven Ranger  \nHerb, Elven Druid  \n**Timeline**  \nDay 8, 9, and 10.  \n\n**The Adventure**  \nWe begin our session in the sewers of pashin.  Ash, Herb, and Eriden wake up with red and puffy eyes.  Eriden's case seems to be worse and he feels much weaker than normal.  The elves diagnose his case as Blinding Sickness, a common ailment in the sewers and give him a poultice for his eyes.  It clears up, but Eriden is weak for a few days afterward.\n\nTalking to Lady Shaylin, the party remembers the key and shows it to her.  She explains that 'the key' appears when there is great need, and that it is very important.  It seems to have been lost for 800 years.  Shaylin does not know what caused it to be found, but it seems that the meeting of the party, the rise of Takhisis, and the return of healing magics in the world are all interrelated.\n\nThe elves seem to be afflicted by a mysterious disease. The house cleric has had no luck in identifying it. They all seem weak for elves, but the disease does not appear to be fatal.\n\nlady Shaylin has seen visions of a place she calls the 'Shattered Ruins'. In the ruins of Hurim, an ancient city, there was once a temple build to honor the Gods of Light. Elven legends speak of a great betrayal by one of the temple's high priests. It is said that the priest sold out to a ruthless ogre overlord, and the ogres sacked and destroyed the city. As the temple fell, the gods cursed the city. Even the roving bands of desert nomads will not venture into the valley now. 800 years ago, the entire valley was sealed off by a landslide. Lady Shaylin has seen visions that the way is now clear.\n\nLady Shaylin gifts the party three canvas tents tents, scarves, and a bit of mistletow for Herb.  The party organized their supplies and equipment and make a rough sled for carrying water and supplies. Shaylin offers Naelathan, one of her guards, as a guide to the secret passage through the sewers:\n\nThe somberly dressed, mordant elf known as Naelathan runs swiftly through the sewer tunnels, until he stops along one of the eastern walls. Holding up a hand, he makes a fist, quietly indicating a halt.\nRunning his hands along the wall, he seems to be murmuring quietly under his breath. With a grunt of satisfaction, he locates the correct switches as a section of the wall suddenly pivots. Turning toward you, Naelathan sweeps a deep, sardonic bow, indicating the opened passageway.\n\"Follow the passage, it should be clear. Once at the far end, you will enter a tunnel that will lead you about five miles out of town. I'd say it's been a pleasure, but then it hasn't been, has it?\" With a mocking chuckle, the elf rises and spins about on his heel, and without a sound, disappears.\nThe path ahead is dark, the tunnel rocky and clearly not of the same craftsmanship as the sewers.\nThe bright sun of the afternoon is a welcome sight after days in the sewers. Ash proposes to head to the badlands, a route that will add an additional 10 miles to the journey, but that takes the party through his favorite terrain. The journey through the desert starts off uneventfully, but soon gets difficult. Seemingly from nowhere, a sand storm approaches. With nowhere to run, the party just huddles behind a small rock outcropping. After hours of white out conditions, the winds finally die down and the party sets off again. As they are walking, they begin to hear a slight buzz.\n\nLooking up, they see a locust swarm approaching. Gylian lit a torch and stood back to back with Eriden. With a bit of time before the locusts arrive, Gylian prays to his god and blesses the party, then sets fire to his shield. The locusts hit and start to bite the party. The mindless swarm just keeps flying by. Misdir shot an amazing arrow that blew a hole through the entire swarm, but it was quickly filled. Misdir ran for the clear, and the rest of the party was enveloped by the locust swarm. Gylian got a locust in his eye, the others had locusts crawling under their armor and into their ears. Seemingly instantly, the locusts swarm passes.\n\nIn a mad dash away from the locusts, Misdir manages to fall into a batch of quicksand. The rest of the party notices he is gone, and they head off in the last direction they saw him. Ash sends his spider, Argon, into the quicksand. It manages to get a rope to Misdir, and the party pulls him from the sand.\n\nHaving only traveled 10 miles of the 85 mile trip, the party sets up camp for their first night in the desert.\n\nThe following day, the party manages good time.  They manage their goal of 30 miles for the day, and even find a decent area to camp.  Ash went off looking for supplies, and managed to find a Quiver-Tree.  He destroys most of the branches, but does manage to find 10 perfect ones, the ingredients for masterwork arrows.\n\nAs the party settles down for the night, they are surprised by a roving group of minotaurs.  The leader madly rushes in and drops Eriden in one hit.  Gylian slashes away and Misdir put an arrow in its shoulder.  Argon feeds a goodberry to Eriden, and he is back in the fight.  \n\nMisdir misjudges his footing and falls to the ground as he attacks, then Gylian goes down, and Eriden catches an arrow to the chest, dropping him unconscious as well.  The fight appears to be going badly.  The spider feeds another goodberry to Eriden.  Ash, paying attention to his spider, instead of the battle, takes an arrow to the chest and falls.\n\nThe minotaur leader soon follows Ash, and the party destroys the scouts.  Goodberries get the fallen members up, and at the end of the fight, the party is left with some used equipment, one damaged tent, and eight minotaur horns.  Gylian carves up the leader, and the party dines on steaks for dinner.\n\nDay three is rough for the party and they only mange 15 miles of travel.  In the evening, they are attacked by a group of draconians.  Misdir falls unconscious right away, and Eriden is surprised as one of the Baaz draconians turns to stone.  He manages to pull his short sword free though and it is not encased in the now petrified draconian.  After killing half of the draconians, Eriden slices off an arm of one of the remaining ones, and Gylian knocks another one out.  The rangers all miss the tracks of the Baaz, but Gylian notices that they lead off to the northeast.\n\nAn hour after the fight, one of the unconscious draconians wakes up.  The party intimidates him and he tells them about 'Big Boss Man', the Draconian leader.  The party coaxes the name Verminaard out of the draconian and he offers a great rewad if they free him.  The party agrees and the draconian leads them back to his hideout.   Inside, they find some loot and two giant eagle eggs.\n\nEriden knocks the draconian unconscious and Ash leaves a deep cut in its shoulder in the shape of an X.  The party heads out and manages to finish the day uneventfully.  We end out session as they aet up camp for the night.\n\nDistance to go: 30 miles.\n\n**XP**  \n5,300 for the session\n\n1060 each\n\n(Total campaign XP per player: 3,098)\n\nCongratulations on level 4\n\n**Loot**  \n\n* 50 gp\n* 4 bloodstones in a small leather pouch (worth 75 gp each)\n* a silver wine bottle of elven filigree (worth 125 gp; the fine wine has long since been consumed by the draconians)\n* a snood (an elegant net used to style a woman's hair) of interwoven golden threads inset with small chips of amethyst (worth 145 gp)\n* Ivory scroll tube imprinted with the symbol of Mishakal (worth 10 gp) with a scroll containing the spells bless and lesser restoration\n* 2 giant eagle eggs in the cave. They can be sold in Khuri-Khan in the spring (giant eagle eggs in good condition are worth about 2500 gp each)",

        "text": "Dawn in 20th century Europe. A time of technological progress, political upheaval, and war. The first great war, the world war, was in progress. Thousands, millions of lives lost in a struggle that seemed endless! It just would have been more poignant if half of the combatants weren't orcs.\n\nIn a world a bit like our own, except not at all really, Mister Numbers stepped in as a temporary DM for a VERY SERIOUS alternate history campaign. Politics, intrigue, war, betrayal, DEATH. So naturally, when the DM got overloaded, the first person he called as a replacement was the GM and writer for the Weirdass World series. Slam dunk, right?\n\nTHROW THE SWITCH, IGOR! THROW THE FUCKING SWITCH!\n\nThe scenario is relatively simple. There are four semi-modern adventurers, armed with magic shit and GUNS, and they have to make their way through WW1 serbia in order to bust into a high-security prison and free Gavrilo Princip, better known as the guy who started this whole mess by shooting an archduke while eating a sandwich. Why? Because politics. But the jist of it was, these four armed murdervagrants were travelling across the countryside of a war-torn world, all brooding and serious with their intricate backstories, and their temporary DM was looking for ways to fuck with them.\n\nSo, the party sets off, electing to go AROUND the massive pitched battle, and conveniently avoiding all those grubby refugees and deserters that keep running screaming from the battlefield. Fair enough. Their route takes them through some border towns, and near a couple of military forts. They're not interested in the conflict, just passing through, but that doesn't mean they can just prance through willy-nilly. People in wartimes are suspicious of foreigners, and might change their opinions if someone were to, say, complete a sidequest for them!\n\nSidequest number one. A bunch of dirty, poor serbians are lamenting a recent tragedy- apparently the Pied Piper has fucked the town over and stolen all their kids for ransom, hiding them in some haunted woods. Sounds like a job for murdervagrants, who are technically foreign spies! They charge off into the woods, intent on rescuing the poor kids.\n\nThe kids did not need rescuing. The \"Pied Piper\" was actually a Kitsune, whom the local humans were SUPER RACIST against. Did I mention that one of the party members was a kitsune himself? Things seemed a lot more sympathetic when they got the Piper's end of the story- she'd driven off the vermin, the town had refused to pay her, she stole the kids. Just like the old fairy tale. UNLIKE the fairy tale, she still wanted to get paid, so she just let the kids dick around in the woods until the townsfolk nutted up and paid her. Apparently they had just hired murderhobos to kill her for half the price. That wouldn't do.\n\nThe party returned to town, and needless to say, they were IRATE. After forcibly gathering up the payment, they gave the money to the piper, returned the kids, etc. Except that now the party's Kitsune had an *[emotional attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boner)* for the snarky lady, and offered her a bit of work, helping them traverse the lands and mayyyybe break into a high-security prison. Sure, why not?\n\nThe party continues onwards, managing to fast-talk their way across one of the less shooty portions of the front, and they are promptly told that they have stepped foot into the territory of a dragon. They had ample warning. But for some reason, amidst magical hobos, fox-people and motherfucking orcs, they thought the existence of dragons was a bit far-fetched. *They were wrong*. The dragon glided off of its mountain lair to inquire why a bunch of two-legs were prancing about in its territory like they owned the place.\n\nThe party panicked, a few of them popped invisibility, and they rabbited for the hills. This proved ineffective, as they were up against a FUCKING DRAGON which could outspeed them without even breaking a sweat. However, the party did get an abject lesson about [loyalty](http://i.imgur.com/kaBNNxJ.jpg), and needless to say, the duergar of the party was a bit IRATE. Thankfully, the guy chickening out under invisibility also had another brilliant genius plan, and set off a blinding flash right in the dragon's face. It crit failed the save, and the party was mercifully able to continue without fighting.\n\nThe next batch of townsfolk were impressed as all get-out that the party had dared stand up to the toll-dragon, who had been a general ass about demanding cash from everyone as a tribute to his imperial scaliness. And if these geniuses had the balls to piss off a dragon like that, would they mind taking on another smaller, less reasonable dragon? The party, seeing that this sidequest was in the general direction of AWAY, agreed readily and set off at a dead sprint before the toll-dragon regained its senses and turned them into very tiny piles of ash.\n\nThey tracked the second dragon- apparently it was a rather bigger deal than just some toll-bastard, because it had a very clear track record of taking bullets to the face with no effect, and then eating cars. Its trail of rampant destruction was not particularly hard to follow. They pursued the heavy footprints all the way to a little cave-lair, and geared up for the coming fight. Unfortunately, they lost initiative.\n\nAlso, it turns out that scared, uneducated townsfolk in the middle of a large-scale conflict can be rather inaccurate when it comes to describing the nature of the \"dragon\". See, this second \"dragon\" did not fly, or breathe fire, or speak in draconic tongue. It didn't even have a treasure hoard. The townsfolk had just seen 'metallic skin, immune to bullets, survives head-on car crashes, claws like sabers, eats cars, utterly implacable' and they just thought \"it must be a dragon\". But, by sheer coincidence, that description could also apply to something like, say, A SOLID STEEL DIRE HONEY BADGER. On the whole, they probably would have preferred a real goddamn dragon.\n\nAnyway, the badger runs right into the middle of the party, abusing its run feat to plant itself in melee range of everyone. Why? Because it's made of GODDAMN STEEL, and it DOES NOT GIVE A SHIT. The party immediately set upon it with guns, knives, shields, screaming, etc. None of it did jack. And then it got worse when one of the party's casters hit it with a fire spell. Not only was it resistant to fire, but now it was A SOLID STEEL DIRE HONEY BADGER THAT WAS ALSO ON FIRE. Thankfully, the NPC kitsune helped out (from a very, very safe distance) by entangling it and allowing the party a bit of time to think up a plan.\n\nSo, naturally, they hit it with ICE. But, since none of the casters had bothered taking actually damaging ice spells, they had to rely on a scroll. This cracked the metal of the badger's skin, allowing the people with guns to actually deal damage, say, once every three shots. Metal creatures are HARDCORE like that. Past that, they frantically tried to mount their best defenses against its occasional attack, and keep it dazed/entangled/prone/stunned/frozen long enough to get off all the attacks they could bring to bear. Which turned out to be... not a whole lot. They ended up whittling it down through concentrated screaming, sustained gunfire, and gleeful abuse of the Ray of Frost cantrip. Yeah, that's right, they whittled down this badass steel creature with the lamest cantrip in existence. And that was BEFORE they found out that the damn thing had ferocity!\n\nSo yeah, they probably would have preferred the dragon.\n\nOnce that was done, the party set about winding down the adventure- setting up camp, bitching at each other, looting corpses, infighting, psychic reprimands, and oh yeah, the goddamn badger exploded, nailing the unfortunate looter with some random magic that would make him incredibly gullible, sweat blood, and also cause nearby undead to start smoking. Thankfully the first two effects were temporary.\n\nAnd so the trigger-happy super-spies laid down to rest, basking in a strange emotional broth of amusement and sheer annoyance. Serbia was freakin' weird.",

        "text": "As a DM I like to say I plan for many things- even if my players get me caught off guard I always rebound quickly and half the time they have no idea that I am rapidly making things up on the spot. I have never been so completely derailed, abandoning all of my vaguely general plans and ultimately causing our Elven Sorceress, Faeroth to be sold to slavery when I secretly rolled a 1.\n\nIt all started when the party was resupplying to go north from the capitol city, and since they had a habit of having their horses getting eaten my vicious monsters, this included buying new mounts to make the journey. Unfortunately in the last dungeon they party was in the Halfling rouge, Levy got a bit greedy and took more treasure than what was gifted to the party and one of the items she took was an unidentified Ring of Animal Friendship. Now I like coming up with both ironic and appropriate curses and I had yet to throw curses at this group so I made this ring act completely opposite as intended, causing every animal who didn't pass a will save to become unfriendly to the rouge. Now at this point in time, in an attempt to haggle and save money, Levy enters the stables in to find a cheap pony, however a stable boy walks by with a prized Heavy Warhorse and I roll its will save, fully expecting it to take just one passing swipe at the rouge. Natural fucking one. So the very big and strong Heavy Warhorse screams and begins assaulting the rouge but only hits once. Levy strikes the horse twice before getting hit again and decides it would be wisest to make a quick retreat, runs out of the stable house and dives into a cart full of hay. While she hid very well, unfortunately the horse saw exactly where she hid and proceeds to roll three very lucky hits (fortunately no crits) and drops her to exactly 1 HP. Faeroth sees this and proceeds to magic missile the aggressive equine to -5 HP, subsequently dragging the battered and bruised rouge out and dealing just enough non-lethal to render her staggered. At this point the stable master has come out and sees his prized Heavy Warhorse being blasted by magic and initially thinks it just got killed. After a moment of checking on it he confirms the horse is still alive and cries to a stable boy to grab a healer. Faeroth pulls out a dagger and tells me she wants to coup de grace the horse. I tell her that doing so will provoke an attack of opportunity from the stable master who has a pitchfork. She instead attempts some diplomacy but gets a firm \"put away your dagger and then well talk!\" \n\nGuards have now been called and can be seen approaching.\n\nWell Faeroth does not put her dagger away and I tell her that a regular attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. She takes it and matches the horse's helpless AC, unable to kill the beast. The stable master responds by stabbing her with his pitchfork. Faeroth then puts him to sleep with magic and then slits to horse's throat.\n\nThere are over a dozen witnesses, three guards are on the scene with more approaching and most of the party is now nowhere to be seen.\n\nFaeroth tells the guards that she put the horse down because \"It was mad and had to be put down in order to defend her comrade.\"\n\nWitnesses say she blasted the horse with magic, did something to the stable master, the slit the throat of an unconscious horse. Due to a good hide check most to the witnesses did not get a chance to see Levy, but one of the stable boys and the group's fighter, Allen was able to identify Levy as being involved. Both Levy (now with a broken shoulder and dislocated knee) and Faeroth are taken in for questioning. Since Levy couldn't walk, one of the guards kindly fireman carries the halfing, but Faeroth mouths off at the guards, insisting she did nothing wrong and properly earns a spear butt to the back of the head taking her to 1 hp.\n\nOur Half-Elven ranger, Enkadu after getting the full details, tries to gain access to Levy and Faeroth's holding cells but fails his diplomacy rolls and is kicked out, but the cleric, Shyvana, has more luck. She is able to get permission to go in and patch up Levy, but is only able to set her broken bones and begin the healing process (A home rule I have is that broken bones can have their healing accelerated by magic, but have to have to bone set and heal somewhat first without an actual regenerate spell- it makes the players have to think and adapt if they have an injury that can't heal instantly with magic). However since witness were able to identify Faeroth as a spell caster, she was placed in an anti-magic holding chamber so Shyvana had to resort to just mundane healing. She then tells Faeroth that her trial will be held tomorrow and worst case scenario, she could be legally bound into slavery (In this particular country, slavery in legal, but regulated by strict laws, essentially you can only become a slave through debt, punishment for a crime, or being captured in war, and subsequently free once debt is paid, time is served or the slave bests their master in open, honorable combat. Illegal slavers are almost always put to death when convicted). \n\nLater that evening Levy has her trial. After some magical investigation (and a zone of truth) it was found out that she had had some trouble with animals prior and that and a witch shopkeeper had told her she was cursed, causing even well behaved animals (which the stable master had vouched that all his stock, and especially his prized Heavy Warhorse were *very*\nwell trained and behaved). Since it was found out that Levy was largely unaware of the curse and what it did, most of the charges against her were dropped, but fined with partial compensation for the warhorse and the medical care of one of the stable boys who got injured in the indecent. The party covered the unfortunately light pocketed rouge and she was free to go.\n\nIt did not go nearly so well for Faeroth. Public execution comes to mind with the crowd that came as rumors spread. She did not help her case by insisting she had done the right thing and generally rubbed the crowd the wrong way only a high elf can. After interrupting the Judge twice she was then subjected to a Zone of Silence and finally accused guilty of her initial charges of malicious property damage and public disturbance, had her charge of attempted manslaughter dropped but replaced with charges of magical altercation (unfortunately I am lacking in the legal names of crimes using magic to render a victim into a different state of conscientiousness against their will via sleep, charm person, ect.) and fined 1,000 gold (the warhorse bear in mind was worth around 400+ gold) and sentenced to 312 days- or 6 months using this world's calendar- of slavery, with the option of her party purchasing her and transferring her ownership to them. At this point Enkadu, who has a rather rocky relationship with her offered to front the whole thing to spite her. Now our half-elf ranger legally owns our elven sorceress.\n\nThis was the second worst I've ever felt as a DM, but I got to hand it to players, they role played it very well, despite how much I had to pull out of my ass.\n\nTL;DR: I secretly rolled a natural 1 for a horse's will save, ends with one of the players a convicted felon and legally is now another player's slave. The party also got a lesson of the country's legal system first hand.\n\n",

        "text": "Out of the brig I march a few paces ahead of my Oathsworn escort, fists clenched, ready to take my anger out on the first thing that crosses my path.  I try to contact Court over comms but receive only static, leaving me to assume there is equipment in the life support systems interfering with the signal.  I doubt that my information would aid him much anyhow.\n\nAs I begin to contemplate who to call first, the decision is made for me.  \"Kaleb.\"  Zez's voice pours into my ear, a welcome sound after dealing with the likes of Yeshuar.  \"I have a question.\"\n\nI put my hand to my microbead and answer.  \"What do you need Zez?\"\n\n\"I don't have time to lay traps and fix up the ship.  Which one should take priority?\"  I expect there would be very little time until Fell's ship is upon us.  Even if we did lay traps, I wonder if he would just pursue us instead, knowing we would be weakened by his underhanded attacks?  All the carefully laid plans mean nothing now.\n\n\"I believe this may be a question for our Rogue Trader to answer.\"  I've already trodden on Klaus' toes enough for one day.  Zez cuts off the call, replacing it with one to all senior staff.\n\n\"Klaus sir.\"  I hear the timid Tech Priest once more, explaining the situation to everybody.\n\n\"I think I'd rather repair the sorry state my ship has found herself in.\"  Klaus commands.  \"It seems our Marcocannons and life support systems both have reached critical damage.\"\n\nAfter a pause, Zez once again chimes in.  \"Which one should I fix first?\"\n\n\"This is your area of expertise Zez,\" my Lord responds, his voice no longer so serious, \"I'll leave that up to you.\"  Zez makes a babbling noise clearly uncomfortable with the responsibility of choosing.\n\n\"Court is currently in the life support systems.\" I interrupt.  \"I think it would be safer to wait until he is done before entering that area.\"\n\n\"Macrocannons it is!\" A happier Zez announces and disappears to work her magic.  If anyone can make them remotely operational after the damage they took, it would be her.\n\n\"While I have you here Kaleb,\" my Lord continues, \"there's been some developments.\"\n\nI raise an eyebrow.  \"Developments?\"\n\nA new voice, Odette, joins the conversation.  \"We found some more crew on the Righteous Path!\"\n\nSilence passes by as this sinks in.  \"You found staff... on board a wrecked vessel that is centuries old?\"  I swear, if Odette has brought undead nightmares aboard our ship...\n\n\"Among the riches,\" Klaus explains, \"there was more than simply gold and silver Kaleb.  We found hundreds of people, all preserved in pods.\"\n\nThe very idea sounds insane.  \"We're going to reanimate this 'crew' and ask them to work with us?\" I question this crazy notion.\n\n\"Given that our staff is down to fifty percent of its usual capacity,\" my Lord harshly reminds me, \"I don't see much other choice.\"\n\n\"You have a point.\" I sheepishly concede, tapping on the side of my glasses.  I suppose it stands to reason these people are valuable in *some* way if they were kept with the treasure on the Righteous Path.  Just what makes them so sought after however, I would love to know.\n\n\"I've already spoken with their leader.\"  So this has all happened while I was in the brig.  \"They have agreed to help us man the ship, at least until we resolve the situation with Fell.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"  If my Lord has come to an agreement, then I will stand by his words.  \"I will be with you on the bridge shortly.\"  The call clicks off, leaving me with my thoughts.  The last thing we need is to lose more crew.  This should really be seen as a blessing.  I will see how I feel about these new employees after I've had the chance to speak to them personally.\n\nUntil such time, I go on my way once more through the ship.  Travelling at a steady pace I take a detour to the Marcocannons where Zez is hard at work, to inspect the damage first hand.\n\nThe corridors are littered with debris, being cleaned up by the servitors.  I move closer towards the door, not expecting to find anything interesting until the sight of a robotic hand catches my attention, poking out from underneath the wreckage of one of the demolished walls.  I motion for the Oathsworn to move the obstruction and they immediately comply.  Once the weight is lifted I see, laying in the soot from the explosion, none other than Zark.  He coughs and splutters, air suddenly able to fill he lungs, but remains unconscious.  Somehow, he survived.\n\nThis boy truly has some incredible luck.  While it's true that this damage could have put us all at risk, I firmly believe that without his actions the witches would have caused many more casualties.  I look up for a moment, peering through a hole in the wall where a hatch once stood.  Zez is moving at remarkable speed, surrounded by her team and inspecting the damage.  In fact, it already looks like she has made significant progress.  I marvel at her skill.\n\nWhen a few minutes have passed, I draw my attention back to the Oathsworn.  \"Move him to my quarters.\"  I motion toward Zark.  \"See to it that he has medical attention brought to him.\"  Those who are skilled as well as devoted to our family are in rare supply.  If we can train him right, we can use him.\n\nThe guards bow their heads.  \"Is this to be done quietly, commander?\"  I nod my head.  I watch as one of them gingerly lifts the battered boy into his arms, the other following him away down the hall.  I linger in the corridor a little longer, making sure nothing else of note turns up, before swiftly walking back up to the bridge to meet the other senior staff.\n\nAs I approach I see unfamiliar men and women heading past me, all nodding as they pass briskly to wherever Klaus has stationed them.  What makes them so obviously new isn't their personal appearance or mannerisms, but rather their lack of clothes.  All of them - in only underwear.  Did no one ask for clothes before they left the bridge?  Why didn't we give them any before they moved out?  I know time is of the essence, but still.  This is what we have servitors for.\n\nI am contacted in the midst of my confusion by the bridge, as Odette's voice informs us all that the ship detected earlier is closing in, along with two others.  Klaus addresses all the senior officers.\n\n\"Is there any particular reason why we would need to stand and fight?\"\n\nIs he suggesting that we run?  \"Sir - if we leave they may put a bounty on our heads.\"\n\n\"We need more time.\" Klaus urges.  \"I would prefer that my ship is back to her former glory if we are to engage a fellow Trader in combat.\"  It's not the trader I'm most concerned with.\n\nI want to argue, but I'm not sure that I can.  We have no idea what Fell's ship is made of, let alone an Inquisition cruiser.  I want to end this, to eradicate our enemies on the outskirts of unknown space, but at the risk to our lives?  Perhaps I'm being a tad over emotional.  We could run - use the time to recuperate - then set a trap before we reach port.  They will surely chase us knowing we hold at least some of the Righteous Path's treasures.  Why does it have to end now?\n\n\"I'm ready to run Sir!\" Odette cheerfully replies, \"I'll make preparations for wrap travel.\"\n\n\"If you command it, I will follow.\"  I give my support.\n\nWith impeccable timing as ever, Court's voice interrupts the call.  \"The life support systems are now secure.\"  I smirk a little.  That was definitely something I wanted to hear.\n\nKlaus catches Court up on the present situation, and he along with Zez agree that retreating is the best course of action.  I finally make it back onto the bridge with Court, Zez moving to make repairs on our life supports now they are safe.  All of us prepare the crew to engage warp speed, when we're hailed by one of the three ships closing in on our location.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3umrmx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_14/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/406jtc/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_17/)",

        "text": "I started my first table top  around 18 months ago.It  it was hell.  After several weeks of dropping hints about my interest, my freind , Ego Dominus, (as he is known  here on gametales ) agreed to let me join his D&amp;D campaign.  At the time  he was running  4th  edtion.  So I sit down  and  having  given my character  some  thought decide to roll  a druid.\n Tragic back story? check. A hasty and as since forgotten cramming   of my character into the plot? check. Me with absofuckinglutly no idea what  I'm doing  or  what I'm about  to walk in to?  CHECK AND  MATE! \n\nSo our  hero's, The Glorious  Chucklefucks, are going  to  some mountian, to save Donovan, the man with many faces, then still  Blake Parish, his  first face. (He was imprisoned  by the deck of many things, remember  that  it will  become  ironic  at a later  time) so    Who should they come upon  to aid them in there quest  but me,  naturepants,  and some random  paladin  NPC, for some reason. \nAnyway after a while we come to the  mountain  and  after journying a while  find a creepy  old man who beckons  to us, but then vanishes, this happens several times, and i'm readt for a figt aganist this leecherous old scrub \n(Father limik in disguise  btw and here i thought  i could take him on no problem), i can just imagine Ego face  if i had found  a way fo try. After  a annoying game of hid and seek with the wizard, the party comes to a chamber with strange  alien life forms frozen in ice.\n One of  them a strange scorpion beast awakens with great fanfare  and prepares to attack us, only to die like lightning when one of the players \" defeat the next monsteryou see\"card from the deck activates.\nAnticlimactic? Maybe. Hilarious? Unquestionably.( especially seeing as how we all initially forgot the card existed and we're getting our ass kicked by  the thing before one of us spoke up saying\" wait a minute shouldn't this thing just Be dead? \nAnd so it  was.\nContinuing on we came to a chamber with many crystalline shards on the ground. Intrigued my character tries to  recall having seen such an artifact but is unable to provide much insight. Still he resolves to take it with him and upon picking it up encounters the first of several tragedies that will soon befall his miserable life.\nDM:  you feel a strange  presence  in your  mind. Make a will save\nMe: ok.\nDM : you fail\nMe : Shit \nDM : make another will save\nMe: here goes\nDM :  you fail. You know only the desire to climb to the top of the mountain and release what awaits you there\nMe: Fuck.  (Inwardly) why am I playing this game again?\nProceeding we soon find Donovan and I believe  my ordeal is almost at an end, that I will escape with only a mere madness\n\nBut then we are running down the hallway fleeing the wizard.\nThe floor is covered in ice and so, my first experience with agility checks is now.\n everyone makes several of them and everyone stays on their feet especially Frederic eisenberg who spawns an infallible f****** horse to help carry him to safety. \n\nThe druid has   no  horse\nHe  fails  a check \nHe falls\nDM rolls for the damage , \nHe breaks a leg.\n\nFrederic eisenberg attempts to stabilize him with lay on  hands.\nWheew \nThank god for the  kind paladin.\nBad roll, Botched healing, permanent limp.\n\nI frantically flip through the book and find a spell that will allow my character to return to the fay wild and and I'm heal. The catch is that there must be something to heal, a deformity won't cut it. \nSo in a hilarious act of irony  the druid asks Frederick eisenberg to break his leg once more.\n\nBut wait you thought it would be Frederick Eisenberg but it was actually him Noel Kiff.\n\n Who proceeded to punch the Druids leg,\nWith his stake.\nHis giant stake, \nUpon which he  activates his flame rune\nYes you read that right a flame rune\nSuddenly the George finds his leg not where he left it.\nIt's become disattsched, if you will\nThe druid mad and with only one leg begs to be put out of his misery.\nAnd so Noel grant his wish will plauge rune stake. To\n The\n HEAD.\nThe the rest of the gang escapes due to the heroic sacrifice of that random paladin. RIP.\n\nBack in town my newly rolled up  character walks up to the party who are messing around with the deck of many things.\nHe draws, one card.\nImprisoned.\nThe table is losing their shit and I am going to never play again. But then a funny thing happened I did.\n\nWeather out of some kind of masochistic tendencies what I desire to get even with my ass hole friends  who knows? But I came back again,  and again, and again.\nI became a Glorious Chucklefuck and found a passion for tabletop gaming, and to think I owe it all to that day\n when I lost my head, twice over.",

        "text": "This is my group's first experience with Shadowrun.\n\nWe're a new group of shadowrunners looking to make our names, so we're looking for any job to take. Our group consists of:\n\nFlash - Our Face / Street Samurai that uses guns\nKarl - Troll with gigantic sword. Very good at being a troll. Not much else.\nPeregrine - Me, the rigger. My main ride is my awesome van. I say van, I really mean Ares Roadmaster (Gigantic armored truck) with a giant MESSERKAMPF! (German heavy metal band) mural on the side.\n\nTo start out the session, Flash gets a call from his fixer contact. It turns out there's a broadcast on loop offering a potential job. (Our GM got the mission from the Neo-Anarchist podcast, you can listen to it [here](https://www.mixcloud.com/neo-anarchistpodcastashadowrun/halloweener-heist-info-and-a-job/).)\n\nLong story short, there's a bar called the Shirley's Ghost with an old Halloweener jacket on the wall. The Halloweeners are a group of psychotic gangers, and Shirley's Ghost is full of people who really want to be Halloweeners. \n\nThat night, a bunch of Halloweeners were going to go in and fight for the jacket. The job was simple: Get the jacket, and bring it to an address for the pay. $10K each for the jacket, $5K each bonus for doing it with no casualties.\n\nWe spend a few minutes planning, and come up with something simple. I'll park the truck outside, and disguise it as a Halloweener van. I'll then send in some fly-spy drones to get a view of the place. Then, Karl will walk in and start a bar fight as a distraction. While he's doing this, Flash will sneak in and grab the jacket, undetected. Flash will enter and exit through the side door, and once he's back, Karl leaves, we all get in the van, and we leave before they realize the jacket's gone. Should be easy.\n\nThe first complication is when Karl enters. Karl grew up in love with the trideo show \"Neil the Orc Barbarian!\" Due to that, he has a certain... \"attempted\" flair for the dramatic. As such, he walks into the bar calmly. Then, he places his commlink on a table with a good view of the rest of the bar. (A commlink is just a communication device, basically it's an iPad. Flash and I have them built-in to our heads.) Then he calmly leaves and closes the door behind it, only to kick the door down and yell a challenge to everyone inside.\n\nFlash and I immediately knew this was going to get bad.\n\nThree gangers inside stand up to fight Karl off. Karl isn't that threatening, his sword is on his back and he's just using his massive muscled arms. But the bartender grabs a shotgun. And shoots Karl's commlink. Apparently this bar has a \"No cameras\" policy. Not only is Karl now upset that his stuff was broken, but now we don't have a way to communicate with him to tell him it's time to leave. And Karl isn't exactly a clever person who could figure it out in the middle of a fight.\n\nFlash and I just figure we'll cross that bridge when we get the jacket. For the most part, the next 60 seconds in-game go pretty well. Flash picks the lock, I keep an eye on everything, and Karl smashes one of the gangers hard enough to break the table he crashes into.\n\nBut then everything goes to hell when one of the gangers pulls a gun and the other summons Shirley's Ghost, who apparently is a real thing. \n\nTo clarify, this isn't a problem for Karl. In fact, the gun goes off at point blank range aimed right at his chest. And the bullet just kind of bounces off. But Karl decides that since THEY have weapons, he should use his weapons too.\n\nSo Karl draws his sword. But because it's a large sword even for him, and he's hitting his head on the ceiling, it slices right through the ceiling, a bathtub on the floor above us, one of the lightsockets, and the ganger who shot him.\n\nFlash and I are a tad upset that Karl has now cost us thousands of nuyen each, but we're more concerned with getting out. Flash has gotten the jacket and is running to the van at this point, and I'm contemplating how to get Karl out without a commlink.\n\nThen the bartender shoots at Karl with his shotgun.\n\nOnce again, not a problem for Karl. The pellets just kind of bounce off, and go through the wall.\n\nOut into the street.\n\nAnd into my van.\n\nThe van isn't even remotely harmed, but I have a connection with it. I've repaired and maintained, and even upgraded it. Having someone shoot it is a problem for me. A problem I would like to solve immediately. So I decide that I can kill 2 birds with one stone.\n\nVery calmly, Peregrine takes a deep breath, waits for Flash to jump in the van, finds the right point, and smashes the van through the wall of the bar, into the bartender, stopping right in front of Karl.\n\nAs the mage starts throwing bolts of searing lightning at Karl (Those made him itch a little, actually) I yell \"WE. ARE. LEAVING!\" out the window.\n\nKarl jumps in, and we exit through the front door. Well, hole where the front door used to be. Well, hole where the hole for the front door used to be.\n\nWe pass a couple of actual Halloweeners on the way out, but they don't realize what happened until we're a good distance away. We sell the jacket, pay the fixer his percentage, and head back to my garage to celebrate a job well done, and discuss with Karl how he's going to pay us back for the money he lost us, after he buys a new commlink or 5.\n\nAll in all, a great introduction to Shadowrun.

        "text": "Sorry it's been a while since I've posted anything on here; college is a busy, busy time. If you haven't read any of my tales about [The Glorious Chucklefucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3jesji/the_glorious_chucklefucks_updated_a_complete/), here's the TL;DR: I ran a D&amp;D campaign for two years with a fluctuating cast of my asshole friends, who were generally having the most fun when they were fucking up my plots and plans. Now, however, the Chucklefuck campaign is over (although I still have several more tales to post from it, when I find the time), and I have set up a new RPG group here at college. \n\nIt's called the NoiRPG, and is sorta kinda my own creation, in that I designed the character sheets, setting, encounters, and most of the rules myself. I based the system and rules off of another RPG system, but drastically simplified and streamlined things to make it easier to pick up and figure out for my players, all but one of whom have never played a tabletop RPG before. The setting of the NoiRPG is New York City in 1925, or rather an alternate version of 1925 where people are drastically less sexist and racist, and a single organized crime family, the Armani Family, rules the city's criminal underground (and much of the above ground as well) with ruthless efficiency and force. The player characters are police detectives investigating various and sundry murders, some of which may or may not tie into a certain overarching plot of which the players are currently unaware.\n\nThe characters are as follows:\n\nWiktor Guyski, an alcoholic Pollack who is apparently a fantastic shot while shitfaced drunk.\n\nKazuto Kirigaya, a blue-haired Japanese detective who is supposedly undercover as a baker, yet openly identifies himself as a police officer during investigations.\n\nJohn Smith, a short Asian man with purple hair who is somehow the strongest and most capable fighter on the team.\n\nAnd finally, Laurie Vedette, a dancer who worked as an informant for the police department for years before being officially deputized.\n\nThe first session began as one might expect an RPG about solving murders to begin, with a murder. Some rich fucker had been shot dead in his apartment, and several of the books from his collection of rare and valuable tomes had been stolen. I'll spare y'all the details of the mystery, but the detectives got to sleuthing, found some clues, and started tracking their suspect. They were doing pretty well and having a good time, but then the combat started. A bunch of goons and an important NPC attacked the team outside a bar, inside which Wiktor was happily and obliviously drinking, and it was then that I discovered a problem with the NoiRPG's combat system: shit's lethal as fuck. \n\nBitches were dropping like flies on both sides, particularly when guns started going off. Realistic, maybe, but the result was that even after Wiktor managed to stagger outside and straight-up blow a motherfucker's head off with a crazy-good roll despite being hammered out of his mind, all of the Fantastic Bumblecunts ended up falling unconscious with two enemies still alive.\n\nFuck a duck, TPK on the first session.\n\nI decided that one of the remaining enemies was badly wounded enough that he bled out almost immediately, and the one baddie left chose to get in her car and flee rather than finish off the detectives. Then some Vigiles Ex Machina arrived to cart the Bumblecunts off to the hospital, where they experienced a remarkably speedy recovery and got back on the case. This changed the timeline and forced me to start making shit up as I went, leading to an encounter in a warehouse with no solution laid out. Forced to improvise, the Bumblecunts decided to have Kazuto bake pot brownies and lure the suspect out by getting him stoned. It worked.\n\nSome interrogation later, the suspect confessed and was given the electric chair, and the high-profile nature of the case earned the detectives a lot of praise and public acclaim; as a result, several powerful individuals have become aware of their existence. More to come following this Saturday, then a hibernation for the winter before we pick back up next semester.",

But stealing my baby and murdering my wife was a cold blooded thing to do, and now THIS was war.\n\nEverything changed, yet stayed the same. I could tell you who lived in this house, or that one. Where the highways took you, ect. It all became corrupted though, tainted, like the water that filled the rivers, and just as dangerous. I had a knack for killing though, and I was a fast learner in the other aspects of surviving the wasteland that became my home.\n\nI found a dog at the gas station near my home, she and I became inseparable, the wife never let me get a dog so at least there was one silver lining. I ended up running into a group called the minutemen. Decided to help them out a bit and one thing led to another and I became their general. I was getting side tracked, thankfully one of the women in the group pointed me towards Diamond city, formerly Fenway park.\n\nThere I helped save a robot man, who then pointed me towards a guy named after the cereal company. Tracked him down and killed him. It didn't make me feel any better, thankfully I was pointed towards a new enemy, \"The Institute\".\n\nAlong the way I made a few new friends: This group called the Railroad, and the brotherhood of steel. Frankly I liked the railroad better but they both proved reliable allies in my hunt for the people ultimately responsible. \n\nI ended up building a teleporter with the help of the railroad, and then arrived inside the institute, only to find out my son was alive! He's old now, older than me, but that doesn't matter. I'm with him till the end. It occurred to me however, that the railroad and the brotherhood wouldn't care who was in charge, they wanted him dead. I wasn't going to let that happen. I don't care what he did or to whom, he was my son.\n\nI arrived back at the railroad, making sure everyone was there. And I killed them all. I felt nothing, at this point killing people was like breathing. The only one that gave me pause was that assaulttron in the back room. I left the bodies, I took the loot.\n\nI then went to the brotherhood, I met the leader there on the airship. And put a mag into the back of his head. Escaping from the airship proved harder than I thought since the knights from the airport apparently had super vision and were shooting up at me. I did however manage to run away, back to the institute. There was no one left to hurt my boy.\n\nOr so I thought. It turns out that the brotherhood was still hanging around. Had to activate something called \"liberty prime\", a giant robot. It blew the crap out of the airship. We did it, my boy was safe at last.\n\nUntil he died of natural causes immediately after, naming me the new Director of the institute. I was there in his passing moments. I told him everything was going to be alright, and I'd see his dream live on and thrive as he closed his eyes for the last time.\n\nSometimes a parent has to lie to protect their child.\n\nI slaughtered everyone I could find inside the institute, and I believe I was thorough with my sweep. They were monsters that kidnapped babies and killed wives, they ruined my life more than the bombs did, for that they had to pay.\n\nI ended up wandering around my old city, helping some, killing others. I was nearly unstoppable now. My dog still loved me as much as she did when we first met. I had no family aside from that, no home either. I killed every major faction in the wasteland single-handedly. Now there is no one left to hate, no enemy to hunt down. I was a true wanderer now.\n\nWar never changes, but it does change you.\n",

        "text": "Little backstory before I go all greentext on you. I got into Magic: the Gathering for a *very* short amount of time in middle school, and that was mostly because I liked the artwork (and I still do). Earlier this month I was talking with some internet buddies, and mentioned Yu-Gi-Oh to them. They asked me if I had ever played Magic. I told them no, not really, but I always wanted to. Ten minutes later I get a message stating that one of my buddies had gifted me a copy of Magic: the Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013. After getting a hang of the basics, I was hooked. Okay, enough expository banter.\n\n&gt;Playing MtG 2013\n\n&gt;Building up my Liliana deck before I fight Nicol Bolas, so I figured I'd replay some older duels and unlock cards. It works, but it's slow, only giving me one per win.\n\n&gt;Encounter: Ghoulcaller. Long story short, this guy's a necromancer. In Magic, this means his playstyle is focused on making me get rid of as many of my cards as possible and resurrecting all of my creatures under his control. Normally, this would be a pretty smart strategy...If I hadn't decided to use Jace's deck for no particular reason.\n\n&gt;For those not in the know, Jace Beleren's deck in Magic the Gathering 2013 is focused around removing as many of your opponent's cards as possible. Not just creatures, I mean cards in general; Lands, Artifacts, Encgantments, nothing's safe from this guy if you know what you're doing.\n\n&gt; Anyway, duel starts. I get four blue Lands and an Azure Mage. I spend the first couple of turns building up my mana. Ghoulcaller, meanwhile, plays Horrifying Revelation, which makes me discard a card, then put the top card in my library (deck) into my graveyard. He does this for a couple of turns, whittling my deck down slowly.\n\n&gt; I'm beginning to consider restarting the duel when I notice a card I just drew; Telemin Performance. Suddenly an idea forms in my head, one that paid off in *spades*.\n\n&gt; Ghoulcaller uses \"Rise from the Grave\", summons one of my stronger creatures from the graveyard (I forget which one exactly, this happened the day before yesterday). Since he summoned the monster that turn, it has Summoning Sickness and can't attack until the next turn, so I'm safe, but if I didn't do something soon, things were going to go downhill on greased wheels. So, I drew another blue Land, played it, and then I played Telemin Performance.\n\n&gt;Telemin Performance basically makes your opponent reveal all the top cards in his deck (the cards that he'd draw over the course of the game. I can't really think of a proper explanation, sorry) until he reveals a creature, and then all non-creature cards get put into the graveyard, and the creature the opponent revealed gets put into play under your control.\n\n&gt; The Ghoulcaller had a deck consisting solely of \"Horrifying Revelation\" and \"Rise from the Grave\". Telemin Performance makes you show all of your cards until you hit a creature, and put all of those cards into the graveyard.\n\n&gt; What does this mean? It means I burned through his entire deck, *thirty cards*, in a single turn. And, since he had no more cards to draw, he lost on his next turn.\n\nThe moral of this story? If you're gonna practice Necromancy, carry around some fucking skeletons or something.",

        "text": "A post in r/wtf reminded me of this story. It was around 2006-2007 when this happened and I was DM for a pick up group at my local game shop. We had played a few games and were about to start a new adventure. They wanted to roll new characters since most of them had been killed at the end of our lay adventure and as we're introducing characters for our new game one of my guys drops a bomb shell on us. Now let me preface this story by saying that I was usually pretty open with what I'd let my players run. Half Minotaur monk? No problem! Mind Flayer psionic with a believable back story! Sure lets roll with it! Godling fighter with a legit weakness so he couldn't go bat shit on the group? Ya okay that works.\n\nI was not prepared for Terry's level of bullshit that day\n\nSo we go around the table, we have a human fighter, half elf wizard, teifling rogue, and then it comes to Terry.\n\nTerry- half infernal phallusmancer!\n\nStunned silence for a few seconds\n\nFighter- Terry...wtf is a phallusmancer?\n\nTerry- it is an infernal cleric who draws his magic from the realm of sexual desire and sinful seduction\n\nI was a young and relatively naive DM at the time (and I might have been a little drunk on wine) but despite the grumbles from the table I told them to let him run with it just to see how bullshit this situation could get.\n\nSo Terry's phallusmancer basically just had a dick fixation and a lot of illusion and enchantment magic with a smidge of psionic ability. He wore robes with dicks on them, had a penis shaped holy symbol, and had a large black dick shaped mace. He had all the usual caster faults (low health, low survivability if put in the fray, limited spells) but what he did have he used to his every advantage. His spells seemed to either cloud the mind so people fucked, or change somethings appearance so someone who fuck it, or just to warp people's minds so they'd fuck each other so he could hit them with his dick mace.\n\nFor some reason this shit pissed the group off to no end. They didn't like that their characters were basically just used to smash people while they fucked each other after failing will saves (this go rolled twenties like his dice were loaded) and after a cult leader and his cultists were reduced to a circle jerk they decided that they had had enough. They put Terry out of the group and replaced him with some new fellow (I think he played a Druid) and Terry was only seen in passing from that day on.\n\nThat was also the game that made me review the level of shenanigans my players were allowed from then on ",

        "text": "[Link to pt.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3uzmsm/dh_why_my_players_now_instantly_kill_any/)\n\n\n**Day 2**:\nThe morning has come, and our players decide to check out the footage from last night, it looks like 5 thugs were keeping an eye on the Arbites, and they followed him out of the inn.\n\nThey meet up with the arbites in charge of the investigation, and he points them to a gang run by a man named Arden, located in a lower level.  \nThey decide to head down.\n\nAs they step out of the turbolift (*star wars elevator music from Family Guy playing in the background*), they notice the 5 thugs in the crowd.  \nBecause of the large amount of civilians, they decide not to shoot up the whole block. However, just as they pass them by, the Rogue stares one in the eyes and tells him to fuck off. Firefight, no injured civilians, 5 dead scumbags. They loot the bodies, and walk to the crowd of terrified onlookers, tell them they are agents of the Inquisition, and just grab the firsts people they see to interrogate them. (Subtlety? Never heard of it.)\n\nAfter some questioning, all admit that the level is under Arden's control, and his thugs are everywhere.\n\nThe players decide to check out the hab-stacks for leads on this Arden character.  \nThe Psyker pays a couple of kids to give him some intel, and they will meet him in 15 minutes in a small alley, the Assassin decides to go with him. The Arbites throws some rags over his clothing, and hides in the crowd, the Rogue stands around watching the crowd, and spots three thugs (they all wear dark brown leather armour like the previous thugs) coming towards her.  \nThey want her to \"call your little friends, Arden wants to see ya.\"  \nOf course, she punches the one that spoke in the face. He pulls out his laser pistol to shoot her, and it blows up in his hand. Another short firefight, our Rogue loots the bodies and finds a note from Arden, inviting them over for lunch to have a civilised discussion.\n\nThe Psyker leaves again for his dark alley meeting with the kids.  \nThe others stand around for a bit until another thug shows up to escort them to Arden's place. They disarm him, and have him lead the way.  \nThe kids show up to lead the Psyker to Arden's hideout, and he gets ambushed by a thug, whose skull he splits in half after turning invisible.\n\nThe rest of the party arrive at the hideout, and notice graffiti on the walls, the symbols disconcert them. A few moments later, the Psyker comes out of a side alley, and promptly pisses himself as he fails his Will check.\n\nThey are escorted into a large feasting hall where Arden, a man in his forties is waiting for them. The Psyker immediately realizes this man is a potent Psyker, but also that their are at least 25 guns pointed their way.  \nArden invites them to sit and eat. All sit down, but do not touch their plates.  \nHe questions why they attacked his men, instead of investigating the murders. The party explains the clues have led them to him, but he tells them that his \"trading\" is not their current mission.\nThey do not believe him, but realize the only way to get out of there is to play nice.  \nJust as they are exiting the hideout, Arden asks the Psyker whether he likes fire.\n\nThe party contacts the Inquisition HQ in the hive, and they are told to get on with it and do their job.  \n\nThey take the lift back up to the merchants' level where they run into the investigator telling them there has been another murder in the central square.  \nThe Arbites goes to the station to check security footage, the rest go to check the body.\n\nThe tenth victims' body is flayed and someone has carved the symbol of the Inquisition in his forehead, and the fountain is spraying blood.  \nThe footage is somehow corrupted, and all the Arbites can see is how the body seems to appear out of nowhere.\n\nThe other members check out the crowd to see if there are any of Arden's thugs around. And who does the Psyker see? Arden.  \nHe approaches the man, and immediately cuffs him, telling three nearby officers to keep an eye on him.  \nThey take him to the station for interrogation, all the way he yells and cries that he is innocent and does not know what they want.  \nThey lock him in a small room while they decide what to do.\n\nThe Arbites wants to interrogate and execute him. The psyker now senses this man is merely a latent psyker, and points out that the subject does not seem to recognize them, and want to hold off the execution. The Assassin and Rogue agree with the Psyker.\n\nAs they question him, he does not seem to be the same person. Arden claims to be a local clerk and a loyal citizen of the Imperium. The party does not believe him, so they push the interrogation. The arbites breaks Ardens' shoulder, and he passes out. The psyker heals him, and break his shoulder again. The Arbites is not convinced, he believes both Arden are the same person, maybe with a dual personality. The Psyker believes the first Arden is some sort of psyker shape-shifter.  \nArden is passed out again, and the party decides to put him in a holding cell, with three guards and the Psyker to keep an eye on him, while the rest goes to his office.\n\nArden wakes up, offering no information, merely repeating that he knows nothing. The Psyker decides he has had enough, and shoots Arden in the face with his laser pistol.\n\nHis pistol fired, the battery registered the shot, all heard it, but Arden is still standing. Except that now he *is* the potent psyker they met earlier.\n\nThe Psyker and three guards are now facing a pissed-off Arden who is throwing flames and punching them with his flaming fists.  \nThe rest of the party hurries back to the station, but take 4 turns to get there.  \nThe Psyker and the guards hold their own for three turns, until Arden incinerates the guards just as the rest of the party arrives.\n\nThey manage to wear him down, and the Assassin finishes him with an expert shot to the head.\n-The temperature goes down to 0, because the Psyker rolled a 9 when trying to heal the Assassin-  \nAs well a howling coming from the psychic energies released from Ardens' body as he is defeated.\n\nAfter healing, they go to Ardens' office, where they find data slates written by both personalities, and his plan to eliminate all merchants illegally selling wraithbones and usurp their business.  \nHe wanted the wraithbones to gift them to powerful individuals and wear them (like Ravenor does in the novels).\n\n\nMission complete, they have stopped the heretic psyker.  \nAnd ignored all the wraithbones out there as they pat themselves on the back.\n\nNot a bad 5 hours for a completely improvised story. I plan on incorporating this into our current campaign somehow.",

        "text": "Perhaps my opinion won't be shared by everyone here, but I was very surprised by the improvements made into 5th Edition D&amp;D. So surprised, that I now have all the necessary books and have started a new campaign with it. It's not just mechanical stuff (but the mechanics are startlingly improved from the mountain of crap that was 4th Edition to me), but even the illustrations, the art, the lore offerings, the especially impressive origin story tables that helped my  new players get excited and emotionally invested in their characters. I could see eyes light up when someone had a backstory unfold and become his, with the way I as DM and he as player made it work with his initial concept (with one reroll, Rule Zero's back!).\n\nI didn't just have a fresh new druid, monk, and ranger going on their first adventure. For two of them especially, the novelty of the \"pick an origin, then roll the details on how that origin\" happened had enough layers that much of the first session was self-perpetuating intrigue.\n\nThe druid was a feral child covered in filth, acting like a delinquent, lying and then covering lies with other lies, untrusting of everyone, until the ranger told him to stop talking, but instead SHOW him who he was. The druid then demonstrated his rapport with rats and vermin, and a bond formed, right then and right there.\n\nAll the while, the flakey monk was citing scripture (incorrectly), introducing himself as a holy man (not entirely incorrect) but doing it in a way that he was opening himself up for free food and drinks and some flattery from anxious vapid nobles in fear of their souls.\n\nAnd all of this, based on what they rolled (with a little imagination to bridge it together), before a single fight broke out!\n\nI do wish I knew whether there was new staff, and plenty of well-deserved layoffs, when it came to the arrogance and failures of 4th Edition. I don't just mean the obnoxious animated advertisements showing a dragon shitting on critics and that sort of thing. I mean the content itself.\n\nRemember the \"cool quotes\" at the start of sections about character classes?\n\nLike the Rogue: \"You seem surprised to see me. If you were paying attention, you might still be alive.\" WHO THE HELL WOULD SAY THAT?! Is he talking to a dead body? Is he sneering edgily at someone who isn't technically killed yet and would have a chance to judo-flip the guy while he's talking all whispery?\n\nOr the wizard: \"I am the fire that burns, the choking fog, the destruction that rains upon our foes\". Can you imagine when a character would say that without bellylaughs from people around him? He sounds like he's listing off powers from his 4th edition power cards (which he is).\n\nOr the \"cool quotes\"  on the monster quick-reference cards?\n\nGaleb Duhr: \"This is how I roll.\" There you have it. Pages and pages of lore on a rock-like living being that was often non-confrontational and reclusive and even helpful in earlier editions, summarized by a dank meme.\n\nI quit D&amp;D and went to Pathfinder for years. And it feels so weird to return. My veteran players like to refer to the newest edition as \"D&amp;D: We're sorry about 4th Edition\".",

        "text": "We begin our session deep in the sewers of Pashin. After a short rest, the party heads on. Ash finds himself drawn to a large room. The rest of the party wants to avoid the visible spider webs, but Ash pushed on. Moving into the room, he was attacked by three wolf spiders, and instantly dropped. Herb set the webs aflame, and Gylian ran in to save Ash.\n\nA spider ate part of his wrist off, and he passed out. Ash got hit again, and dropped, unconscious into the water. With the fire growing larger, the party battled on. The ceiling began to collapse, and many spiders were crushed. Ash managed to find an egg, and concealed it in his pouch.\n\nAfter clearing out the spider lair, the party heads to the east. There, they come across a large chamber of 4 foot rodents. The capybara. One of them gouges out Gylian's left eye. The party finds the remains of a hapless adventurer, and decides to leave the animals alone. Herb manages to snag a capybara with Animal Friendship, and it follows the party.\n\nMoving further in to the sewers, the party came upon what they though was a band of Gully Dwarves. Ash soon realizes that they are goblins and a fight ensues. Eriden hit the leader with a huge hit, bringing colossus slayer and hunter's mark to bear. Then gets nailed by the enemy and drops. Misdir drops, and the fight looked perilous. The leader finally drops dead, and the injured are stabilized.\n\nOut of the darkness an elf approaches.  He leads you to a secret entrance.:\n\n   With a silent whisper, a portion of the stonewall swings in revealing a long, narrow passageway that leads to a set of stairs. The stairs lead down, deeper into the earth. The stairs continue for about ﬁfty feet, opening into an enormous room that seems to have been carved out of the earth hundreds of years ago. Soft radiance, apparently from small dancing globes of light, creates the illusion that the ceiling high overhead is a starlit sky.  \n   Instantly, the people who have taken up residence in this ancient chamber note your presence. As swift and soft as the night wind, word spreads through the press of bodies, through the tiny city of tents and lean-tos that have been arranged in the chamber. Weapons glint in the soft light from above like ﬁreﬂies in the dark.  \n   A tall, slender ﬁgure separates from the crowd, gliding forward without apparent effort. Shrouded in white gossamer robes, her silver-white hair a nimbus that tumbles down her bared ivory shoulders, this woman seems more a spirit than a creature of ﬂesh and blood. Pale blue eyes openly gaze at you, and though the Elven woman’s face is that of a young woman in the bloom of youth, her eyes hold a sadness and depth that belies her apparent years.  \n   “Greetings,” she murmurs softly, her voice barely above a whisper as she draws to a halt a few feet away from you. “I am the Lady Shaylin Moonborn of House Mystic. It was I who called you.” A small, bitter smile brieﬂy crosses her face, an expression that seems unnatural upon her beautiful features. She turns slightly, her slender hand rising slowly to indicate the rest of the chamber, and the gathered elves huddling together, all eyes upon you.  \n   “Welcome to our humble home.” She gazes back at you once more with pain-ﬁlled eyes as she nods her head, “Please, you must be tired. Follow me, I will show you someplace you can rest and I will answer your questions.”  \n\n   Later in the evening, you reach a good-sized tent, the delicate silk stained by exposure to the sewers. Tears in the fabric have been carefully mended, giving the tent an odd sort of dignity. Brushing aside a panel, Shaylin invites you into the tent, quietly following.  \n   The interior of the tent is simple and sparse. It is illuminated by a flickering flame sitting in the center of the tent. The flame gives off a little heat and light but there is no smoke. A small chest lies off to one side with a leather backpack leaning against it. A small bedroll is neatly rolled up and set atop of a pillow. The delicate smell of crushed jasmine fills the tent, a welcome reprieve from the fumes of the sewage and waste.  \n   Inviting you to sit down, Shaylin's fair cheeks are brushed with a crimson hue and her gaze lowers as she softly admits, \"I am sorry that I cannot show you true hospitality while you are here, but I'm afraid what little we have is carefully rationed.\" Shaking her head, she gracefully sinks to the ground, tucking her legs beneath her as she con-templates you one by one.  \n   \"You are wondering why I summoned you here, are you not?\" Shaylin tilts her head, patiently waiting for your answer before she continues. \"It is because I have seen...\" Now a tiny furrow appears between her eyebrows. \"I have been having dreams for the past few nights, dreams that are most disturbing to me. I wake shivering and filled with dread, but the details of the dream escape me as smoke escapes flame.\" She sighs softly, looking down at the glowing fire for a few moments before she continues. \"All I have been able to remember is that it involves you. All of you.\" She looks up, piercing you with her gaze.  \n   Suddenly, her eyes go distant, color draining from the two orbs until they seem a pure, solid white. Her voice falls into a sing-song pattern as she murmurs, \"There is a pattern, you cannot see. Instead you must set your spirit free. Take the key to the shattered ruins, through the sands and over the dunes. Seek the answers in the sands of time, search your souls and find the sign.\" \nWith a shudder, the elven woman's head snaps up and she draws in a long, harsh breath, only to end up coughing violently. Wearily rising to her feet, she looks at you all once again.   \n  \"I am tired and must rest soon. Please, rest for now and we shall speak later?' ",

        "text": "I've been DMing Dark Heresy for only 3 or 4 games, so I still make plenty of mistakes, but we mostly play to have a good laugh.  \nTwo players couldn't come at the last moment, so I had to improvise everything.\n\nToday story has 4 players: an Arbites, Rogue/Scoundrel (we play in Spanish, I'm not sure what the class is called), Assassin, and Psyker, all level 1.\n\nThe story is generic as hell: Our players are tasked to investigate a series of murders on a wealthy merchant level in Hive Pust, the latest victim is a senior merchant that controls a large part of the largest guild in the sector.\n\n**Day 1**:\nAs they arrive at the scene of the crime, they ignore everyone and go straight to the body.  \nAfter a quick look at the body, the Psyker notices that there is not a single drop of blood in the body, with no apparent puncture wounds. He suspects heretic psykers are at large.  \nThe Arbites notices that the victim's shoes are brand new, no marks of any kind that would indicate a struggle in the merchant's office.\n\nAfter a short conversation with the arbites in charge of the investigation (who is more than happy to let them have the case), they find out that this is the 9th victim this week, all bodies are conveniently stored in the Arbites office/mortuary just one block away.\n\nFailing all perception throws, no one so much as glares over his incredibly tidy desk, and they decide to check out the other bodies.  \nAll victims were merchants, except one that was a scribe. I don't recall exactly what each body had, some had obvious stab wounds, another chocked on the fingers of a previous victim, one was burned, other gutted. Upon investigation, the number 9 kept popping up: 9 fingers, 9 cuts to someone's tongue, killed at exactly 9AM...\n\nThe Psyker realizes that this number is often associated with the Archenemy, and explain his \"rogue psyker\" theory to his companions.  \nThey agree that it can't be a coincidence, and decide to split up.  \nThe Psyker is going to investigate the place where the burned victim died, the Arbites is going to go through the security footage, and the Assassin and Rogue are going to investigate the Scribe's office.\n\nThe Psyker immediately realizes that the fire was not natural, however, traces of an accelerant were found on the victims' body. Through his power as a seer, he witnesses the victim's last moments, doused in Promethium and set ablaze by a psyker.  \nThe Arbites is going through the footage around the approximate hours of death. At several of the murder sites he spots something that isn't quite right, just after and before the murder, someone/something is moving through the crowds, but show up as some sort of static on the feeds.  \nThe Rogue and Assassin are checking out the Scribe's office. Co-workers didn't know anything about his private life, and he often worked into the night (sweet, sweet overpay). For once, the Rogue passes a Perception check, and finds a data-slab with a cryptic message:  \n\"Tonight, 3AM, your office\", no sender, and they are unable to use the data-slab.  \nThe Assassin checks out his records, and soon they find that the clerk denied one of the other victims a trading permit, due to \"previous criminal charges\".  \nThey consult over radio, and will meet up at the Arbites station.\n\nThe Arbites shows them the footage he found, all explain their findings.  \nThey look up the merchant that was denied, and it was because he had previously traded Wraithbone. All agree he should have been executed on the spot.\n\nBy now, it's evening, and they decide to have a nights rest at a local resting place.  \nInstead of discussing what to do the next day, they speak in front of everyone about their suspicions. All fail their perception checks, and have dinner.  \nThe Arbites decides to go out for a walk after dinner while the Rogue and Assassin go to bed, the Psyker stays at the table.  \nAfter a few blocks, he notices he is being followed, and quickly returns to the inn.  \nWhile he was out, the Psyker ~~interrogated~~ asked the innkeeper nicely if he knew anything about wraithbone. After intimidating him, he confesses that a local gang has been trading wraithbones. The Psyker goes to bed, and 1/2hour later the Arbites arrives. He explains that he was been followed and will check out the security footage tomorrow morning.\n\n[Link to part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3v01m8/dh_why_my_players_now_instantly_kill_any/)",

        "text": "This is a tale of the most broken encounter I’ve ever been a part of, but it wasn’t one that I dmed no, it was one dmed by the guy who plays Oni in my gamebreakers campaign. The sneakiest one of them. Of course, he was even more tricksy and scheming as a dm than he was a player so our whole party is constantly paranoid of him, except for the incarnate, who seems unerringly confident. \n\nThis one might be longer than the other tales I’ve written but I think it deserves to be told.\n\nBackground: So the party goes thus, Ryyn the warlock, Echo the rogue, Theren the cleric, Aldwyn the incarnate (ported messily from 3.5e) and Dolus the [Blade Mage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Blade_Mage_%285e_Class%29) (homebrew class from the internet, we changed it a bit) in a homebrew world, amid season 2 of our adventures. Check out [kettlecheeps](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/search?q=author%3AKettlecheeps&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) for some [season 1 shenanigans](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3gg4h1/dd5e_the_gang_starts_a_riot/). (I was Hyedael in season 1, he died). I am playing as Theren the cleric of Nemesis, one of my old paladin’s door to door converts. But the greater focus here is on aldwyn, the incarnate from another dimension. His joining the party is absolutely worthy of its own tale… But I digress.\n\nOur party is getting involved in the war between the Feras and Sophos (see [season 1 preface](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3g0x10/dd5e_the_adventures_of_solana_and_the_gang/) for a small amount of info on races). And found their way into a Feras laboratory where they were making alternate food sources and weapons of mass destruction… we were ever-so cautiously proceeding through the place, fighting wendigo monsters that had escaped from the biology wing when we met this curious individual. We were skeptical of everything in this place because we had been warned of a Sophos-killing super-warrior construct that was loose somewhere in this place with us, on top of the breakout in biology. But this guy wasn’t killing the Sophos in our party yet so we let him tag along with us. Plus we were hesitant when probing him for questions on account of his chainsaw sword. We made our way to the generator and persuaded a man at swordpoint to fix it for us. The power comes back on and the scientists promptly and unsurprisingly tell us that we have seen too much and want to kill us. Our incarnate then threatens to burn the generator with alchemist fire if they try anything and we are left at a standoff for a few turns. In this standoff we discover a scientist and his two successfully cloned wolf pups and start probing him for answers, primarily where the robot was, and his answers were interesting. Basically that its creator gave it this special rune on its chest that has now given it this semblance of humanity and the plot twist, that the guy with the chainsaw sword was him. Only because of that rune was he able to resist killing me and ryyn. At this point our party is broken in two, rogue and warlock with the scientist and incarnate and cleric with the robot and generator, the blade mage waiting in the hall near the latter group. It was then that the scientists let an override command ring over the intercom. “Vox populi (name of robot) this is an active warzone, you are surrounded, kill all hostile targets on sight.” \n\nEncounter: Our curious companion loses his now-visible binding rune that was keeping him human, he reveals himself to be a badass Sophos killing construct with two chainsaw swords. Staring down the incarnate and cleric, the cleric was a Sophos. We knew this guy was capable of taking the wendigo monsters one on like 3 at least, and it took the whole party to deal with a wounded one before. We also knew that he was designed with the fighting style of a legendary warrior, who took on a dragon one on one. Needless to say, we were scared. Roll initiative, of course the incarnate crits. At this point I should mention that the incarnate begins his recurring habit of rolling unnaturally well whenever he attempts the most dangerous and absurd shit. The moment of truth cometh.\n\nThe incarnate has been using the past three months trying to communicate with his deity Pelor, day after day spent in silent prayer to communicate with his god across dimensions. And he finally broke through, weakly speaking with him and gaining favor. He called on this favor right now, a desperate plea to get his god to reach across the borders of the two worlds and simply put that rune back on the robot’s chest. The dm gives him a chance, roll and d100 to see how effective it is.\n\nNatural 100.\n\nNow it works, mostly, the machine is now fighting its own programming and desperately trying to remember that we are friends and the cleric steps in, evoking the assistance of nemesis and casting beacon of Hope to try to help. He rolls d100, 67, and that puts it over the edge. \n\nThe robot powers down, the facility goes dark again. And when we turn him back on, he is sensible and independent. We had won. \n\nAnd then the wendigos attacked. But it wasn’t too bad with the robot tearing shit through them with chainsaws. Vox is now a lasting ally, he lives on our boat and we are working on helping him become more independent. \n\nThat is how we broke the shit out of what should have been one of the hardest bosses since the season 1 finale, turning the murderous robot into a friend by having the sun god teach him to love. It wasn’t the last time the incarnate broke the game but it was definitely the best.\n\nps. Don't worry, the wolf pups were ok, we made a point of protecting them.\n\nTL;DR: if you pray enough, you don’t need to be in the same dimension to teach a robot to love.\n",

        "text": "When I woke up, Dantalya introduced me to the other dragons. Fírnen, Iormúngr, Morelth, Agaravel and Helia. They are much less frightening when you know they aren't going to eat you. Dantalya told me they can speak directly to my mind, but they have to get to know me first. I went to sleep that night knowing that I had made some new, unusual friends. \"Maybe\", I thought, \"Maybe I'll be able to get through this\".\n\nIn the next few weeks I was taught me their language, and I got to know them better. Fírnen and Saphira were mates, Iormúngr, Morelth and Agaravel are their offspring. Helia was an orphan like me. Dantalya told me she had found her near the edge of the forest, gravely wounded and left for dead. She brought her here and cared for her until she recovered. Saphira and Fírnen adopted her as their own, but she never quite seemed to fit with the others.\n\nSoon we became friends, bonded by our shared, sad past. She stayed with me and comforted me whenever I got homesick and wanted to go back to my mommy. And I comforted her when she missed her parents. I found out that singing helped us feel better. So we sang whenever we were sad. Then we started singing when we were happy too. After a while the other dragons started listening too. We noticed singing improved their moods also. Dantalya told me I had quite the musical talent.\n\nA few years went by and Dantalya taught me several new languages. Helia and I continued to sing almost every day. My talent, however, ran deeper than anyone had thought. I could control water with my song. I wasn't able to do much at first, just make waves in different shapes. When I saw what I can do with just my voice I began to practice even more. During that time I sometimes saw Dantalya sneak off somewhere. She would be gone for hours on end. When I asked her about it, she never told me anything. I found out why on my eighth birthday.\n\nFor my eighth birthday she got me a violin. My very own special violin. And she had spent years making it for me. Now I knew where she was going every time she vanished. She said something about it being magical, but I didn't listen. I just wanted to try it out. It took me a while to get used to playing it. For about a month or so it sounded pretty bad. Not even Helia would stay with me. Determined to get better, I practiced every day. After a month went by, I was pretty proficient with it. Soon after that I found that I can control water with any music, not just my singing. Helia would also stay with me again during my practices.\n\nAs I grew older, Dantalya started telling me tales of her adventures in the world. She too was not originally from here, but she was determined to make the best of it. She told me wondrous tales of her adventures. How they went back in time to save great heroes. How they found the weresheep and started a trade with them. Stories about her friends. The creation of Stefany. The fight with the sun god. Their assault on Ajora's fortress. Their experience in the temple of the Goddess. And finally the shattering of the Mirror of time.\n\nI suspect the mirror's destruction somehow caused me to get torn from my world. Dantalya's search to find a way to bring me back home bore no fruits either. I've decided to venture out in the world. See it with my own eyes. Helia and I packed our things and set out to see the world.",

        "text": "Prior to our current game, I had DM'd a single, rules-lite session with most of the current group of players. A new player familiar with DnD had joined us and everyone had decided to start fresh with new characters except for our rogue who had decided to play a younger incarnation of his Shackles pirate.  They rolled their stats and eventually our party consisted of:\n\n- a Kitsune Oracle of the Outer Rifts with the Wrecker Curse (**nameless**)\n\n- a Human Rogue of the Shackles (**Mortdecai Smithdus**)\n\n- a melancholic and sorrowful Elf Bard (**Evie**) \n\n*and our new player:*\n\n- a Thri-Kreen Barbarian named **Gar**\n\nOur game had been rules-lite as previously and lacking notes, I decided to improvise most of the game.  *This is what happened:*\n\nThe party began in the small, coastal town of Durwall where the heavy rain and storm had forced the arriving ship's crews and local townsfolk into the tavern.  After some slight hesitation, Evie, Mortdecai and the Kitsune all somewhat have begun small talk while a loud screech and shouts erupt from the docks as townsfolk quickly began to shuffle out to investigate.  Outside, a ten-foot tall creature snarls at the several fishermen fearfully keeping the creature at bay amidst a scene out of Moby-Dick.  Gar had been transported to Durwall out of his will via a large crate aboard the ship.  Nearby, the other players (*minus the Kitsune who had preferred to watch from the tavern's window*) had arrived with other curious townsfolk to bear witness to the creature.  Gar makes his way through the crowd as the now love-struck Evie flings himself towards the Thri-Kreen and \"bonds\". Due to Gar's player announcing the Thri-Kreen predisposition towards Elf meat, they bond with complete disregard to the conventional lore. \n\nInside, the party get to know each other more through a game of Five Finger Fillet with his new Elf friend.  Gar being the honourable sportsman that he is, takes it upon himself to *\"acquire\"* a proper hand for the game and quickly returns from outside the tavern with a freshly cut human hand.  An angry group of townsfolk burst in dragging along a man they intend to rough up towards the bar where the Kitsune is sitting.  The Kitsune inquires about their dispute with the man as Gar and Evie decide that the best course of action was for Gar to fling Evie at the man ready to bash in their captive's head into the bar.  Gar rolls and successfully throws into the man despite his grip firmly still on their captive's collar.  When the angry townsfolk were about to beat Evie as well as their captor for the interruption, Evie sucessfully rolls Bluff to convince them it was someone else.  The angry townsfolk look towards the direction Evie pointed and in came a rain-soaked man gasping and clutching the bloody stump of a forearm.\n\nThe captive is let loose as his captor now marches across the crowded tavern to confront the hand-less man now leaning against the wall and groaning with agony.  It is here, the rogue decides to fling a glass of rum at the captor while Gar flings his chair.  The rogue lands his hit while Gar's chair flies wide and shatters at the hand-less man at the door, shattering on impact and finally erupting into a fully fledged bar fight.  The captor's posse now rush to gang-up on the arm-less man, successfully making their way and beating the poor soul into negative hit points before Gar rolls an Intimidate check to frighten off the gang.  Seizing the opportunity, the rest of the party grab the captive from earlier and rush into the upper floors of the tavern while the Kitsune rolls a 20 on stabilizing the man's wounds and subsequently his hand.   The grateful NPC is now dragged along as the rest of the party is busy interrogating the captive held by the angry townsfolk.\n\nJaynos (the captive) is beaten and eventually spills that the townsfolk are angry over unpaid overtime at a nearby mining site.  He explains also that many of the people who have previously worked have experienced night terrors after digging in the lower pits.  Satisfied with the information, the party unanimously decides to bind, gag and lock Jaynos into a nearby closet as they turn to the now healed NPC.  Evie ponders before issuing this ultimatum:\n\n\"You have thr...four choices:  \n\nOne, you stay and end up like Jaynos.  \n\nTwo, we can kill you and feed you to Gar... \n\n*Gar grumbles*  \n\n...Three, you come with us. \n\nOr...four...I sing to you...\" \n\nWithout a word, the NPC strides forward and hugs Gar as the NPC replied with, \"I worked there yesterday, I know exactly where the site is.\"",

        "text": "This interrogation won't be as simple as the previous one.  The Adept before was Inquisition; he could be manipulated.  Those fools are easy enough to figure out.  You can play them to gain their trust.  The cultists however, Yeshuar in particular as their leader, are not the same.  They have already lost a crucial part of their mind - their sanity.  Conventional intimidation techniques will most likely be ineffective.  But since my Lord has agreed he will not 'be harmed', there is little I can do.  I am unable to get revenge, unable to use leverage and quite frankly, have nothing I could use to force him to speak if he chooses not to.  Meanwhile, he is someone who can bend the warp to his will.\n\nNothing is ever easy.\n\nTwo Oathsworn guard escort me to the brig.  Along the way I do my best to suppress my own witch nature, but between the adrenaline still pumping through my veins and my revulsion for this man, I fear that I lack the focus to perform any more feats this evening.  Perhaps he won't think to notice me?\n\nI arrive in the brig to find six other guards stationed already around the prisoner, adding to the two alongside me.  Inside Yeshuar sits at a table, his hood removed, the unholy light from his skin replaced with something else, almost an internal glow.  Whatever it is I feel compelled to admire the man - which is all the proof I need to know that these feelings are the result of his own wrap trickery.  I approach him wearing my hatred as a shield, standing by the table leering down at him while the guards move to ensure my safety.  He is dressed in rags, an old dirty looking blindfold covering his eyes.\n\nDespite this, I get the feeling that he can still see everything around him perfectly.  \"Hello Kaleb.\"\n\nHis voice grates in my ears.  Hearing him say my name makes me recoil in disgust.  \"I will not tolerate such familiarities with the likes of you.\"\n\n\"My apologies.\"  He smiles.  \"Would you prefer 'Lord Winguard?'  Or perhaps, 'my Lord'?\"\n\nHe speaks in a polite tone, as one would to a superior officer.  Even so, I can't help but find it mocking.  \"You will not speak until I ask you for an answer.\"  Already I want to shoot this man.\n\n\"As you wish.\"\n\nI finally take the seat opposite him at the table.  I look at his face, staring at where his eyes should be underneath his bindings.  Placing both hands on the table I sit up straight, preparing myself to speak without losing my temper.\n\n\"What is in our life support systems?\"\n\n\"My fellows.\"  He answers, quickly without skipping a beat.\n\n\"I guessed.\"  I move my glasses back up my nose.  \"What have they become?\"\n\nAgain, his cracked lips break into a smile.  \"They have ascended.\"\n\n\"Into what?\" I press.\n\n\"Into...\"  he pauses, giving his response some thought.  \"Into greater beings.  What the Gods -\"\n\n\"- Spare the sermon I do not care for it.\"  I spit, raising my voice as rage leeks out.  \"Tell me what I want to know.\"\n\nYeshuar leans back slightly in his chair.  \"There are many names.\"\n\nI narrow my eyes, waiting for him to elaborate.  \"Pick one.\"\n\nOnce more he tilts his head in contemplation.  \"...the uneducated refer to them as 'monsters'.\"  Mutants, more likely.\n\n\"And the educated?\"  \n\n\"...the divine.\"\n\nThe hopeless back and forth goes on a while longer, no matter my approach.  No change in tone, no undisguised threat affects the chained up cult leader as I feared it would not.  \n\nUntil he leans in, speaking to with a low whisper.  \"You seem to be new with your own abilities, my Lord.\"  I stop, unable to ignore this.  \"Perhaps I could teach you?\"  He beams at me, his putrid breath stinging my eyes from close proximity.  \"There's much for you to know.\"  Does he really believe I would let him poison my mind?\n\nI feel something inside me snap.\n\n\"Who are you expecting to save you?  Your God?  Your Rogue Trader?\"  I stand, resting my weight on my arms as I lean in closer to his face.  \"Your Inquisitor?\"  I slam my hands on the table and break away, unable to stomach Yeshuar in my personal space for long.  \"The only reason you are alive is because of my Lord's mercy, or believe me, you would be dead.  Now tell me - what have you done?\"\n\nYeshuar folds his hands on the table, sitting up to face me.  \"I entered your life support systems with twelve acolytes.  I left by myself.  I didn't see what became of them, but I know.  The holy power of the warp saw into their souls.\" He pauses, licking his lips.  \"They ascended to their truest forms.\"\n\n\"So twelve abominations, hiding in the shadows unless you come to harm?\"  One would assume that monsters wouldn't care for the wishes of their once-leader.  Yeshuar seems to be under a different impression.\n\n\"If that is what you want to call them.\"  His expression changes, but this time it isn't a smile.  The corner of his mouth twitches, almost in an all knowing smirk.  \"Some of your men are meeting them right now.  I believe the one you know as 'Court' is leading them.\"\n\nI pause, trying not to let him see this revelation has caught me off guard.  I didn't notice Court on the security cameras when Zez and Klaus returned.  He must have caught a different shuttle with Odette.  It is possible that he gathered his men and went ahead to clear the life supports systems on his own while I was heading down to the brig.  The look on Yeshuar's face tells me that he isn't lying.  I hope Court knows what he's doing.\n\nI sit back down in my seat.  I press further with the interrogation quickly, asking him which God he's sacrificed his soul toward.\n\n\"The holy four.\"  Again his replies are not answers, merely riddles.  This time he seems amused by my ignorance.  \"You really don't know, do you my Lord?\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you should regale me?\"  Gathering anything from this waste of time would be a plus at this point.\n\nHe chuckles.  \"I thought I wasn't allowed to preach?\"\n\n\"I'm giving you permission.\"  I listen to him prattle on about the chaos Gods, who I have to confess I know very little of, bar their names.  He describes them with his own warped views; Nurgle, commander of the laws of nature; Tzeentch, the bringer of change; Slaanesh, the embodiment of desire and anguish; Khorne, slayer of the unworthy, ensuring the survival of the fittest.  Through his words I get images of the four twisted and terrifying beings.\n\nHe then speaks of a new God, one he claims to be gaining power.  Tarm, unmistakably for who his cult is named, made from worship.\n\n\"Any prayer powers him,\" he says, his smile growing wide and wicked, \"even the prayers to the Emperor.  They all feed Tarm.  His power will be exponential.\"\n\nAfter sitting through his ramblings, I have had quite enough.  Satisfied that I will gleam no more from this madman, my only goal is to antagonise him as he has me.  I lean towards him, mimicking his actions from before.\n\n\"If you truly have such power, how did my crew defeat you?\"\n\nHe sighs, smile disappearing.  \"You still haven't learned, have you?\"\n\n\"Learned?\"  I raise to my feet.  \"You bore me.  Your mindless faith in those Gods is beyond my comprehension.  The fact that you really believe it yourself is proof of your own stupidity.\"  I walk around the table, standing a few paces away from the still seated Yeshuar.  \"What really matters is self preservation.  Trusting yourself, not some God to protect you.  You preach, but yet you're still alive not because of these 'Gods', but because of men who manipulate and indulge your fantasies.  It's pathetic.\"\n\nMy words seem to strike a nerve.  \"Every coin, every man - it's all a step on the path that leads to Tarm.\"  He squirms around in his chains.  \"You soon will realise that these bodies are nothing compared to when you offer yourself up to the warp, and become one with its pure energy!\"  He takes a deep breath, calming himself before clearing his throat.  \"If you want me to teach you how Kaleb, I will still be happy -\"\n\nUpon hearing my name a second time, I raise my hand and strike him hard across the face.  I'll be damned if I allow such filth to speak to me this way.\n\n\"My men will destroy your precious disciples.\"\n\nYeshuar leans against the table, pushed down by the force of the slap.  \"Perhaps.\"  His voice returns to his normal, elated tone.  \"If they can, then I suppose I will be seeing them all again soon.\"\n\n\"Rest assured,\" I start, leaving the cage as the Oathsworn move him, \"I'll make them all burn.\"\n\nI storm away from the brig, but not before I hear Yeshuar have the last word.\n\n\"I've already seen them burn.\"\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3sydx2/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_13/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3vnmi5/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_15/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3vnmi5/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_15/)",

        "text": "Hey everyone. So, a year ago I began to chronicle my DnD group’s whimsical and slightly disturbing story. Partway through, I went to college and became much more busy, and the story got put on the backburner and I forgot about. I felt particularly guilty recently, and remembered I needed to finish my group’s fucked-up tale. The previous part can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2enga1/doing_all_the_wrong_things_for_all_the_right/\n\nMy recollection of the story isn’t quite as detailed now, so it’s a little more condensed.\n\nAs they exited the inn, the party discovered that the city was being attacked by zombies. After fighting their way through a horde of undead, they came face-to-face with the necromancer, a heavily armored old man riding atop a skeletal dragon. He offered the party a choice: they give him the amulet they found earlier in exchange for the cure to the zombie plague, or be destroyed. Seeing no other option, they gave it to him.\n\nThe necromancer flew away, taking most of his zombies with him, and the paladins began distributing the cure through the water supply. During this, Grandmaster Ragnar revealed that the necromancer was a man named Avekyr, his old mentor and the former grandmaster of the Knights. Ragnar had believed him to be dead for quite some time, but it appeared as though he had faked his death and had become a lich.\n\nRagnar told the party to make their way to the elven capital and warn the Empress about the dangerous necromancer in her lands. On the road there, they ran into Ulf, Eden, and Wolfgang, who informed them that they had learned about a magical artifact on the island of Emnon, located just off the coast of the elf kingdom and offered to help them in their quest in exchange for later help.\n\nSoon after, the group was attacked by some strange robe-clad figures, each of whom wore a mask with a crude scorpion painted on it. They cursed the party for “assisting the Heretic” and summoned demons to try and kill them.\n\nAs they travelled deeper into the elven forest, they came upon a city built inside and on top of massive and still-alive trees, some of which appeared to be blackened and twisted. They learned that some unknown force was corrupting the trees, and agreed to venture into the root system of the forest to see what was wrong. Once there, they found more of the masked cultists siphoning the life force from the trees, and quickly killed them. The somewhat homoerotic elves thanked them for “helping them with their wood.”\n\nOn their way out of the blackened part of the forest, the party was attacked by a corrupted ent. As they had been murdering anything I could throw at them, I made this encounter a bit more difficult. As a result, Lankoris died. I felt a little bad and decided to give them a one-death buffer. With a poof of confetti, Lankoris was resurrected. A man wearing skintight red and blue clothes appeared nearby and told the party, “You only get one.” His voice sounded suspiciously like the Lantern King. Lankoris quietly erased the current deity on his character and replaced it with the Lantern King.\n\nThe party reached the elven capital and informed the Empress about what was going on. Ulf also asked about the island, which they learned used to house a scientific research facility during the Great War roughly 250 years prior. Something went horribly wrong on the island, and a magical barrier was put up to prevent anyone from entering or leaving. The only way to bypass the spell was to use the enchanted key, which was given to Ongvar the Hero (Avekyr’s second-in-command zombie), the Empress’s former lover, and buried with him.\n\nAn out-of-breath elf soldier burst into the room saying he came from a town to the southeast that was being attacked by an army of zombies led by a man on a bone dragon. The party offered to help, and the Empress gifted them some of the fastest horses in her stables to ensure they would arrive there quickly.\n\nThe party reached the new town, which was located near the Dead Plains, a mass burial site where most of the dead from the Great War were buried. They saw Avekyr’s army of undead not attacking the city, but instead digging up the bodies and reanimating them. The party’s presence was soon discovered, and Avekyr swooped down and confronted them. Lankoris asked about why the cultists referred to him as “The Heretic.”\n\nAs it turns out, despite being a lich, there still was some good inside Avekyr. He informed the party that the reason he was raising an undead army was to fight an army of demons that the cultists were trying to summon, including an ancient god known only as “The Destroyer.” The amulet that they found was actually a very powerful artifact, and he needed to make sure it stayed out of their hands. Meanwhile, Ongvar told Ulf that he would give him the key to the magical barrier if the group retrieved his old helmet, which he left in the cave of the last dragon he slayed.\n\nThe party did so and tracked down the cave. Inside however, was the last living dragon, which hatched from an egg that Ongvar had failed to find during his dragonslaying quest. The party barely managed to slay it, but they got some sizable loot from the dragon’s gold pile, as well as bag of holding. In the future, the Jizzard would frequently avoid walking places by climbing into it and leaving just his head sticking out while someone else carried it. They found the helmet and Ongvar, a zombie of his word, gave them the key, which turned out to be a heart-shaped locket. They rode back to the capital to find passage to Emnon. They found out that the Empress had already found them a ship, which happened to be captained by their old friend Frodnar.\n\nProtected by the locket, the ship sailed through the massive fog bank that surrounded Emnon, and landed on the shore. In the ruins of the ancient city, they found the last survivor, a mostly-insane elf who told them that there used to be a floating island that housed a weapons research lab, but one day it fell from the sky and crashed into the city, letting loose a horde of strange monsters.\n\nThe party entered the lab and learned through reading and old notebook that the lab housed a failed attempt to create elf-tarrasque-hybrid supersoldiers. The party split into two groups: Amanduh and the Jizzard went to find the artifact that Ulf requested, and Lankoris and Whiskey set off to find the main reactor that powered the magical engine that used to keep the island afloat. After fighting their way through carnivorous plants, the mutant hybrids, and other experiments-gone-wrong, Lankoris and Whiskey set the controls on the reactor to “full” and Amanduh found a room that housed the Tarrasque, chained to the wall, as well as some magic bones that were used to summon it in the first place. The Jizzard scurried around and collected things that looked cool, which turned out to be unique magical gear the party could use.\n\nThe party regrouped and began a frantic escape from the facility. A series of bad rolls later, things weren’t looking too good for the party until the Jizzard, in a heroic act of self-sacrifice, detonated every bomb that he was carrying, collapsing the tunnel on the pursuing hybrids and allowing the rest of the party to escape.\n\nThe entire island exploded as the party got back on the ship and began to sail away. As they reached the fog bank, Amanduh who recently had begun to have a hilarious tsundere relationship with the Jizzard (just in character, not in real life), decided that she could not live without her precious Jizzard, and jumped off the side of the ship. Whiskey tried to save her (mostly because she was carrying the bones that the party went there for in the first place), but only managed to grab the back of her coat, which she slipped out of and plunged into the water. Lankoris and Whiskey could only watch in horror as the fog choked the life out of her. Thankfully, the bones were in her jacket pocket, so not all was lost.\n\nNow that Ulf had all the pieces that he needed to reforge the legendary blade, and told Frodnar to sail upriver to the dwarven city of Hammerdeep. Lankoris and Whiskey mourned Amanduh and the Jizzard on the voyage while they rerolled.\n\nThe party arrived at Hammerdeep and met the Jizzard and Amanduh’s new characters, a dwarf brother-sister team named Darthal (a cleric) and Balbo (a druid), respectively. Ulf told them that the reason they needed to get to this city specifically was so they could use the Soulforge, the best-equipped dwarven forge in the land.\n\nThey soon learned that would be no easy task, as an army of goblins, who normally left the dwarves alone, had risen up out of the Deep Trenches and were attacking the city, and had already taken the Soulforge. The group met up with the dwarven military, who gave them some powerful new weapons and sent them to the front lines, where they helped a squad of dwarven steampunk mech suits push back the goblins. At last, they arrived at the Soulforge, and were surprised to see the High Priest of the cult that had been periodically attacking them throughout the entire campaign.\n\nAs it turned out, the High Priest was Bellamin, an old party member in the previous campaign that Whiskey’s player, Balbo’s player, and I had played in. Bellamin was created by the DM for a very inexperienced player and designed to be easy to play; just a lawful-good cleric of Pelor. However, after the player learned that in D&amp;D, you are free to do anything, he proceeded to commit a series of incredibly evil acts such as torturing people for fun. Whiskey and Balbo agreed that there was not a more evil person I could have picked to be the main villain. A kind redditor also drew him: https://i.imgur.com/ybxxlBY.jpg\n\nBellamin gave them a dramatic speech about about the master plan to summon The Destroyer. All that was needed was the final piece: the soul of someone truly evil. Bellamin dropped a cloth-wrapped bundle he carried to reveal the rotting corpse of Geoffrey, whose soul had been unable to leave his body after being brutally murdered and left by the side of the road. He ripped the soul from Geoffrey’s body, setting into motion the end of the world.\n\nAfter an epic and dramatic fight, the group dispatched Bellamin and his entourage of priests, killing Bellamin by throwing him into a nearby pool of lava (which was fitting, as Bellamin was already covered head-to-toe in burn scars from the time he tried to solo a dragon in the previous campaign).\n\nUlf set to work reforging the legendary sword. With the advanced dwarven forge and Ulf’s skill, it took little time, and he presented the party with Godslayer, a ridiculously overpowered greatsword with the ability of +1 plot development. Now that the blade was reforged, our old characters had finished their quest, giving everyone some much-needed closure. However, there was an evil god that needed to be killed, so Ulf gave the party one last gift: an old prototype that he had originally designed for the dwarven army. It was a direct ripoff of the 3D maneuvering gear from Attack on Titan, but everyone in the group were huge fans of the show, so they loved it.\nThe four left Hammerdeep with grim determination. They met up with Ragnar and some other paladins, who informed them that a portal had opened up right in the middle of Asgaron and demons were pouring out of it. They made haste to the city, where they found Avekyr and his army. Ragnar was furious with his old master, but Avekyr managed to talk him down, saying that working together to save the realm was more important at the moment.\n\nWith a combined army of paladins, undead, dwarves, elves, men, and a clan of minotaurs that came down from the mountains, the party began the climactic final battle. They all had a blast zipping through the city on their 3D gear cutting through demons until a colossal scorpion, the avatar of The Destroyer, came through the portal and began wrecking shit up. The party decided that the best course of action was to split up. Lankoris and Balbo went to close the portal while Whiskey and Darthal faced The Destroyer.\n\nThe latter two zipped onto the scorpion’s back as it smashed buildings. Whiskey kept the demons off of Darthal’s back while he attacked its head. Both of them frequently had to dodge the scorpion’s stinger, and it was a really cool encounter. Finally, with a battle cry and a massive blast of flame from the sword, Darthal cleaved The Destroyer’s head off and it crumpled to the ground.\n\nAt the same time, Balbo transformed into a huge bird and flew Lankoris right over the portal. Lankoris pulled out his bag of holding, and chucked it into the portal. Everyone passed their checks to get away as a massive explosion levelled half the city.\n\nMany lives were lost, but ultimately, the world was saved. After the last of the demons had been slain, Avekyr and Ragnar confronted each other. Avekyr revealed that the reason he became a lich was part of a misguided plan to protect the realm for as long as possible. However, he realized just how far he had fallen and submitted to Ragnar. Avekyr released his hold on his army, and the corpses, including the dragon, returned to death. With a solemn goodbye, Ragnar beheaded his former master for the use of necromancy, as was law.\n\nIn a surprising act of selflessness, Darthal decided that Godslayer was too great a power for any one man to wield, and handed the sword over to the Knights of Retribution to keep it safe. Suddenly, time froze, and the Lantern King appeared one last time to congratulate the party on a job well done. Lankoris asked why he had been resurrected, to which the Lantern King responded that it’s pretty lame to end a joke before the punchline.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Darthal and Balbo returned to their hometown. Whiskey used the gold he accumulated to open a bar in Asgaron, which he trashed every night and rebuilt every morning. Lankoris became a prophet of the Lantern King, and traveled the land spreading the word.",

        "text": "I participated in a particularly short campaign of DND in the Warhammer 40k universe (I forget the name). This was my first ever DND, so it was a learning experience for me.\n\nSo, we start of as a group of random guys. I honestly don't remember what the others were classed as (it was a few years ago, be gentle), but I know I went for some sort of stealthy rogue (cliche). \n\nWe start off on a pilgrim ship headed towards some distant imperial-shit hole to help colonise the planet for the glory of the Emporor. We weren't a party yet, but we would shortly find ourselves bound together.\n\nAll is quiet on the ship, the usual hussle and bussle is going on, life is normal, so of course a meteorite storm appears out of no where. \n\nNow this wasn't your normal run of the mill meteorite storm, oh no, this was a world ending sort of storm, directed straight at our ship. So naturally we panicked.\n\nAlarms start blaring, and the GM tells us to do a perception check to see what the announcer is saying. We all fail (as is the lore of the dice gods), so I start running with the rest of the ship to where ever they are going. Another also joins my dash towards the rear of the ship, while a third seems it nessicary to \"direct\" people by waving them on. Needless to say he was the only one doing this, and after a tip from the GM, he started running.\n\nWe now hop over to the other two players, who are brothers, who are also on the ship. They have the excellent idea of hiding in a box. So they get in a box. \n\nEveryone else is running to the end of the ship, as the first meteorites start to impact on the shields. THey do not last long, and the explosions on the hull start to wear away at the metal that susatins the emporors finest (well, we say finest, thats just what the preacher said to us). I am the first to make it to the rear, and discover that everyone was running for the escape pods. I manage to bash my way through the hoard and bag myself a seat on an escape pod, which shortly ejects itself from the ship and starts to decend to the nearby planet. The two other players manage to bag a seat too, but one of them thinks he's the bees knees, and says \"I'm going into the VIP pod\", and so he does. He manages to sneak by the gaurdsmen and get into the pod as it ejects.\n\nWHile he is congratulating himself, he shortly realises that he has just snuck into a pod which contains some of the actual emporors finest, as in the Inqusition. Now, when you are but a lowly civlian in the imperium of man, you learn that the Inqusition are mean buggers, and by that they mean you shit yourself just thinking about them. \n\nSo, there he was in a pod full of the worst people he could have become groupies with. He fails a bluff check, and is met with angry glares. He promptly shits himself.\n\nNow, back to the two brothers in a box. Now, they had realised that hiding in a box wasn't the best way to survive a ship getting blown up by large hunks of rock plowing through space at a rather high speed. They try to get out, and prompty bash their heads on the top of the box and get a minor concussion. \n\nThe other player who was getting in the pod was having a sort of impromto-battle with some other civi who thought that he was more deserved of a seat. The two were rushing to the escape pods, as explosions rained down at the ship. The airlock door to the escape pods started to close, and the player made a last ditch dash towards them. He made it, as the door shut behind him, the guy fighting him tried to drag him back. His arm got cut off by the door, but not before the ship split in two. Everything was fucked from now on.\n\nHe manages to get one of the last seats and blasts off from the dying ship. \n\nand thus ends our story for now. not much happened afterwards, as the players didn't have a clue about rp and one guy just didn't give a shit and played on his DS near constantly, ruining the flow of the game. \n\n\"But edward!\" you shout, \"What about the two idiots in the box?\" They were still trying to get out of the box, when a servitor picked them up and dragged them along, thus knocking them over and giving themselves another missed turn. The GM gave up at this moment, as it was quite literally the beginning of the game and this was our first game of DND, so he just said that the box survived the decent onto the planet below, with them recieving damage for it.\n\ntldr; fuck asteroids.

Some \"That Guys\" are awful enough that they don't just irritate the DM, they irritate the players.\n\nSuch was the case of the Minotaur Ranger With Two Bardiches, or MRWTB. Yep. Dual wielding was all the rage, and bardiches were a the time very min-max. So were minotaurs, especially when \"kitted\" in the broken 2nd Edition D&amp;D way. How bad was this guy? Well, for starters, when he DID die, inexplicably his next character was an identical MRWTB. \"They're a smart minotaur tribe and know which weapon does the most damage when dual-wielded!\"\n\nImagine that in character: \"Rise, young calf, and know you are now bull. Do maximum damage while duel wielding, as is your birthright.\"\n\nWell, he did die several times. Like the title says, first time was when he wanted to show his fabled storied tradition of maximum damage to a mysterious cave with a reptilian presence reported in it. Turns out it was a basilisk, and turns out he followed my narrative cues into being caught mid-swing-pose, turned to stone.\n\nThis party loved slings. Had three characters with them. Cheap ammunition, bludgeoning damage was handy for the kinds of monsters they often fought, and when bullets weren't available, they did stones, such as shattering MRWTB and having an ammo bonanza.\n\nSecond time he died? The party stumbled into a fay-folk miniature kingdom, and were greeted with music, taunts, teasing, strange spectacles, pixies mooning them, the works. Everyone had a good time and laughed, except MRWTB.\n\n\"I ready my composite long bow.\" Yeeeeeeep, he had to have the maximum damage weapon, as was also fine minotaur tradition.\n\nI told him the pixies weren't having that, and some won initiative and moved to snip the bowstring (I wasn't cruel, I assumed like most rangers he could use Fletching proficiency to fix and replace it).\n\n\"I dual-wield attack the fay-folk.\"\n\nThere weren't swarm rules yet, but when you have what I described as dozens of small beings around a big guy, and when there's no way to hit them all in a meaningful way in short order because there was no Whirlwind Attack or the like, you can bet he went down very quickly.\n\nAnd woke up without his Ranger class. As was the rules back then, he turned into an ordinary Fighter with no blessing of the wild.\n\n\"I kill myself.\" Presumably with dual-wielded bardiches at the same time.\n\nAaaaaand he made ANOTHER MRWTB. All he did was change the last letter of his name, every time. Another fine minotaur ranger tradition.",

        "text": "I apologize in advance for one quirk of this story. The emphasis will not be on the game involved in it, but in the people playing it.\n\nBrief bit of background: this is when I kicked M out from my 2nd Edition AD&amp;D group, but also a bit after that old group dissolved entirely, leaving me hurting for a new group to DM for. I would have settled with being a player for a decent DM too, and for that reason, I started visiting local hobby stores.\n\nOne in particular looked promising: it was in the \"nice\" side of town, had a rather cool looking professional-seeming logo on the doorway, and it occupied what was a retro-style diner that went out of business shortly before. It seemed like a good omen to see a new game store instead of counting the gradually-disappearing ones in the shadier sides of town.\n\nIt was not as good an omen as I had hoped.\n\nFirst, the good side of it: It was a slick operation. It was clean inside, well-lit, having all the signs of newness. There was an over-emphasis on trying to sell miniatures, especially for Warhammer, but I forgave that and forgave the rather thin supply of books. The books were awfully modern too: none of the rustic charm of out-of-print games. The miniatures that were made for D&amp;D were almost entirely drow/underdark stuff, which definitely was a sign of the times. This was the age of Drizzt clones, psionic powergaming, and ultra-thin veneers of \"underdark adventure\" that were excuses for lonely men to talk about evil, potentially defeatable/conquerable clerics of Lloth and other creepy stuff.\n\nBut I digress. Sorry.\n\nThe guy behind the counter was friendly enough, looking quite average and unremarkable, with no obvious neckbeardisms (this is before fedoras took off, but many of the trappings of euphoria were already in the works, like anime shirts, replica swords, and trenchcoats) striking up a conversation with me shortly after he noticed me looking at the miniatures. \"You play D&amp;D?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'm a DM.\"\n\n\"EPIC!\" (this word took so many years to finally drop out of common use, and this was the start of it) \"My store is organizing a scheduled D&amp;D game. We got a full cast of the local greats. They could DM, but... you like DMing, more than playing?\"\n\nI was hurting for a group, and while I liked playing too, it seemed to be my lot to be the DM. So I nodded.\n\n\"Epic! Let me add your name to the whiteboard...\" he squeaked my name on a whiteboard on the wall. Somehow that was really cool, I recall, at the time. It felt official. Like some professional roster. I was going to DM for some players that knew what they were doing! Tacticians! Comedians! Method actors! Maybe a trickster/buffoon or two. And the odd power-gamer, but I was ready. I was thrilled!\n\nAnd so I returned, days later, and saw a game table set up. I saw a section of miniatures were moved to make room. I saw the same guy that signed me up, waving me in from the door. It felt nice to be wanted... but it also felt a little like a fly entering a spider's parlour. It didn't help seeing all the spider imagery and underdark spam cluttered together in the corner.\n\n\"AngryDM! Glad you made it!\" He said in a rather announcer-like voice. \"I told the usuals all about you.\" I wondered what he meant by 'usuals' when the place only opened up recently, but I didn't get around to asking. \"You guys have fun and drum me up some business!\" The counter guy went to the backroom, turning on a TV.\n\nThat's where my eyes moves fourty-five degrees and finally paid attention to the table where it was set up, but not before my nose was struck first.\n\nBelly button lint. Unmistakable. Ever poke your finger in your navel as a young one and sniff the tip? That weird, head-repelling smell. I remember squinting before my eyes could focus.\n\nHere's what I saw at the table, from the people seated who didn't even raise their eyes, lead alone lift their heads, to look at me. They were already making characters. As was my DM instinct, I peeked at the character sheets. 18s. Oh, for humility and to show character weaknesses, the odd 17 or 16 here and there. One poor soul had a 15 in a dump stat!\n\nHere's how the four of them looked: One was the splitting image of Penn Jillette, and considering the height of his Comedy Central appearances, I wouldn't rule out that's where the glasses, shiny-oily forehead, smarmy smile, ponytail, and raincoat (not trenchcoat in his case) but raincoat, worn indoors, squeaking up the chair he was sitting on. He had cigarette butts stuck through a can of Jolt, and I don't know whether it was a freshly-drank can of the discontinued proto-energy-drink or some sort of collector's idem, because the thing was stuffed with cigarette butts. He stood up suddenly, making a show of looming over me.\n\n\"We... don't need help making characters. You understand, right kid?\" Thrusting his belly at me like a pelvic thrust, he waddled outside, to smoke in the rain. I guess, to his credit, he didn't try smoking indoors.\n\nI looked around the rest of the table. One was a skiny pizza-faced guy with thickly curly blonde hair, doing the \"TV's Frank\" thing near the front, but unintentionally. His hair was just that sticky, with large dandruff flakes in it. He made a loud \"TCH\" sound, clicking behind his teeth as the Penn Jilette impersonator left the table. He reached for Penn's character sheet, and spun it around with his fingertips, leaving oily smudges that smeared some of the numbers written on the sheet that I could see from where I stood.\n\n\"Fucking bullshit.\" he said, shaking his head. \"I already called the drow.\"\n\n\"The DM didn't say we had a drow limit this time,\" said a third voice. This was the most athletic and unconventional-looking of the people seated, not least of all because he was visibly asian, probably filipino, seeming in decent shape, but with the quirk of wearing a leather jacket, which he presumably wore in the rain, which explained the weathering of it. He also had a pair of those metallic balls that you are supposed to turn in your palm, in a lacy box, the kind you'd get for a few hundred tickets at an arcade with ski-ball lanes. \"We don't have a drow limit,\" he said, commanding more than asking, looking up at me. \"We don't have time to start over.\"\n\n\"I, uh, don't have drow in my setting.\"\n\nThere was a brief and awkward pause, then a seemingly-scripted, artificially loud phlegmy cough from the last person seated at the table. \"YOUR... I'm SORRY... YOUR SETTING?\" he kept coughing as I examined him. Even moreso than the Penn Jilette impersonator, this guy took the proto-neckbeard cake. First off, he was at least ten years older than the others present, wearing a weird hat that I had to look up from memory, that I just learned is called a \"tam\". It was sort of matched up with the kilt he was wearing. Yes, a freaking kilt. With tall socks, sandals, and shirt with very faded Metallica lettering. He had this oily-looking cane leaning on his side of the table.\n\n\"Yes. I do homebrews.\" When 4th Edition came out, years later, I was already well underway of being a D&amp;D heretic. Yes, I make my own settings, and have made quite a few. Some gravitated near D&amp;D norms, but no, none of them had a freaking underdark. I admit I had something of a sick-and-tired attitude of the idea of BDSM elf gimmicks.\n\n\"You fuckin' kiddin' me, kid?\" he thumped his cane, loud, on the carpet, hitting the floorboard beneath as if he struck a gavel.\n\nI stood my ground, silently. \"I find pre-made settings too stifling. In my Sword Coast books back home, the towns are mapped to the square yard, leaving nothing to the imagination.\"\n\nThe Penn Jilette impersonator clapped his hand hard on my back, and I felt a stinking waft of nicotine blowing across my face from behind. \"That's the BEST PART!\" he says, loudly against my ear, with no concept of personal space. He took his seat, coughing, which made the tam-wearing kilted guy belly laugh and start coughing too.\n\nThe guy with the leather jacket stood up, pointing across the table, almost poking me before he thumped his hand down for some reason. \"Remember when we looted Elminster's house and sidestepped every trap?!\" loud high-fives all around.\n\nThe pizza-faced curly-haired guy glared up at me. \"What time period do you run Faerun?\"\n\nI knew that Forgotten Realms was a rather rigidly over-mapped and over-planned setting, but these guys had it down to which freaking time period!\n\n\"I don't.\" I shook my head.\n\n\"You want to enter the big leagues, son, or want to play magical tea party?\" Said the kilted one with the silly hat.\n\nI admit I wasn't that assertive back then, so I turned and left without another word, with that awkward sensation of eyes on my back, then laughter.\n\n\"Another DM slain!\" sounds of high fives as I entered the rain.\n\nI looked back only a few months later. The place was now a different kind of theme breakfast diner. I think I know why.",

        "text": "First, I apologize for my absence. Reliving this tale in such a short span of time sent me into a catatonic fit, and prevented me from continuing my sojourn into the depths of my RPG hell. But, I have recovered, and I can now continue the Tale of [The Three Players that BROKE D&amp;D](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3qycsl/the_three_players_that_broke_dd/)\n\nWhen we last left off, my players had exterminated a large portion of the local wildlife, and had now returned to the city of Zant with several (slightly singed) pelts, and the head of the Great Bear, wanted for destruction of property, eating of local wildlife, and public defecation.\n\nAfter collecting their reward, they reunited with Mialee, who had been asleep at the Inn (Her player had been absent the week before), and they debated what they should do next. After some debate, they party decided to examine the market, and see if there was anything to do around town.\n\nNow, the market of Zant was more of a Bizarre Bazaar, with wild animals, rare gems and spices, weapons and slaves traded as freely as groceries. The players wandered through several streets, taking in the exotic nature of the place, before meeting up with Jonson at his stall. \n\nOnce there, they inquired as to anything he had heard during his business deals over the past day, and he informed the party that the town had a group of thieves running amok and stirring up trouble.\n\nIntrigued, the party once again split up to look for clues. Wright wandered amongst the herb vendors, trading some of the potions made from his blood for various spices he needed to make the drugs and potions to keep his blood rage in check, and chatting up the merchants for info on the thieves.\n\nMialee, meanwhile, enlisted the help of the cats to prowl the streets, relaying back to her as she hung out at the inn, talking to a few of the other travelers to see if they knew anything.\n\nAnd Alcatraz prowled the rooftops, sniping birds with bolts of eldritch fire.\n\nSurprisingly, Alcatraz was the one who found the thieves, as his unique position and a surprisingly good perception roll allowed him to realize that the little kids in the market were swiping goods, and handing them off to various older kids (mid-teens), who in turn exchanged them with people in black for lumpy sacks.\n\nUnfortunately, Alcatraz took this information and ambushed a kid after one of the trade-offs, murdering him and then examining the contents of the sack he had just received...\n\n...Which were loaves of bread and lumps of cheese, intended for the other street kids as a deal they had brokered with this group of thieves. They swiped goods, and the thieves fed them with a small cut of the profits.\n\nI had intended for this to be a kind of grey area quest: sure, the kids are stealing, and the thieves are profiting off child labor, but they were also feeding the kids and not harming anyone, so the party could have really gone either way with how to handle things.\n\nSo Alcatraz ate the kid's meals, pissed on the corpse, and set it on fire. After removing the right hands finger bones. He then tracked the People in Black to an open sewer outlet on the edge of town, and rolled another really good perception roll to spot the numerous foot prints coming back and forth in the muck.\n\nSo he promptly went back to the other two group members, told them he had found the Thieves, and led them into the sewers to murder the entire thieves operation.\n\nSo, the party surged forth, mapping the sewers as the encountered the under-city of Zant - sunken buildings intermixed with the pipe work of the city above, small lakes of sewage that came from burst pipes, rats the size of dogs that attacked them as they pushed farther in.\n\nFinally, they reached the thieves layer: a series of rooms with a few side corridors, where the group of about 20 thieves stayed when not out trading goods or meeting with their suppliers.\n\nSo, the party stormed in on a group of about ten Lv 3 rouges in the first room. Who all looked up in surprise as a Bird-Man, a Tiger Lady, and Satan smashed through their front door and began to tear them a new one.\n\nThe battle was short and brutal, with no hostages taken. With murdering no longer on their mind, the Players decided to investigate the surrounding areas, encountering a few guards, and quickly bringing the death total to 16.\n\nAnd then they found the storage room.\n\nNow, the thieves guild had been up to its antics for a while now, and had amassed quite a bit of loot: several swords, some magical; a long staff in a black box with magical seals; bags of to-be-transported goods; a chest bolted to the ground which they were unable to open; ect. The party was ecstatic.\n\nThen they promptly attempted to loot all of it, without any means of transportation or carrying it.\n\nAfter several futile minutes of attempted looting, the players grabbed the most valuable items and those that sparkled under the gaze of detect magic, and moved on wards.\n\nAfter a few more rooms with beds and another with a common table and chairs, the party arrived at a wooden door that hadn't decomposed, and in fact looked rather new. From beyond it, they heard voices, and quickly devised a plan for the situation:\n\nPeople in next room -&gt; enter next room -&gt; murder them and take their stuff.\n\nThat settled, they burst through the door and engaged the targets found beyond.\n\nNow, the room they had burst into was about half the size of the rooms up to that point, and decorated as a strategy room. The walls had maps of the city and the surrounding countryside, and the center had a table with scrolls and books scattered all over it.\n\nIn the room itself, there were five people: two grunts, like the 16 others they had carved through to get there; a large, imposing man with ashy skin and dreadlocks; a thin elf woman with large, ornate daggers on her waist, and a scowl on her face; and a hooded man in tattered robes gripping a black wood staff.\n\nObviously the party targeted the magic user, who yelled at the others to cover his retreat as he dove through a floor to ceiling mirror against one wall, which rippled as he passed through it, then shattered as Alcatraz's eldritch blast struck its surface. The two grunts leapt forward, but Wright eviscerated both with a sweep of his hands.\n\nThis left the Boss and the Elite Mook, who flipped the table up to get cover as the party advanced. The Elite charged Wright, bullrushing him back into a wall, and proceeded to beat on him as Alcatraz dashed towards the mirror, rolling spellcraft checks to identify what magics had allowed a the hooded figure to escape.\n\nThis left Mialee to go up against the Boss, who was built as a level 6 Rogue/Ranger. Pulling out both daggers, the Boss went toe to toe with Mialee, who began to have some of the worst attack rolls I have ever seen. She must have rolled at least five ones in a row, which I treated as her whiffing on her attacks, causing her to grow more and more frustrated as the fight wore on.\n\nMeanwhile, Wright managed to pound the Elite into the ground, taking longer than usual because the Elite had Die Hard and a level of Crusader, coupled with levels in monk. Wright was particularly annoyed as Alcatraz sniped the Elite for the kill, and then proceeded to gloat about it.\n\nAnyways, the only combatant left was the Boss, and Mialee finally rolled a successful hit. In fact, she rolled a crit, confirmed it... and then rolled minimum damage. It only dealt like 3 points, but since she rolled a crit, I ruled that she had sundered the Boss's armor. I honestly felt bad that she hadn't gotten a hit in during the whole fight, and her crit was so bad, so it was intended to make it easier for her to hit the Boss in the future.\n\nThe other players decided to imply that Mialee wanted to bang the female leader, and made snide jokes about her \"disarming\" attempts for many sessions to come.\n\nThe end result was a semi-naked elf and an enraged Tiger Lady standing over her. In hindsight, it was hilarious.\n\nAnyway, the battle wrapped up after that. With the Elite dead, the Boss gave up, and they began to interrogate her (after giving her some clothes). As Mialee was also an elf, she handled the interrogation, and they figured out that the hooded figure had been a necromancer that had been supplying the thieves with magic gear in exchange for ingredients for his rituals.\n\nThey also looted the room, discovering a few magical books which they couldn't read, the money from the operation (about 2K gold), and a strange box that they couldn't open.\n\nSatisfied that the case was over, and interested in following up the new lead, the party debated what to do with the captive. Mialee wanted to keep her as a retainer, and Wright wasn't opposed to it, but Alcatraz felt the need to add to his kill count, and thus immolated her on the spot.\n\nThe other players were none to thrilled, nor was I, as I began to grow weary of my NPC's being killed off for his amusement. Anyway, the party found another exit to the Thieves hideout, and returned to the city. After informing the town guard of the hideout, and being rewarded, they retired to the inn for the night.\n\nThe next day, the party set out for the markets once again, intent on having their new gear identified, and finding out about the mysterious box. Wright also wanted the Bear pelt they had found to be turned into a bag of holding, so they could hold more loot.\n\nTheir first stop was Shady Steve's discount emporium. Shady was a man who had a reputation for haphazard magic and ridiculously low prices. He specialized in magic items that might or might not kill you when you used it, but it would only cost you an arm or a leg after you bought it.\n\nThis naturally attracted the players attention, and they convinced Steve to turn their bear's head into a Bag of Holding for dirt cheap. The only downside was the random chance that they wouldn't be able to find the item afterwards, due to a backdoor that Steve put in so that he could filch items from his customers. \n\nThis issue was solved by Alcatraz sneaking back in after the other two left and murdering Steve when he had his back turned.\n\nFor a wizard, he had surprisingly bad habits, and no alarm spells, so Alcatraz got away with it, and stole a bunch of magic swag to boot.\n\nNext, the group headed towards a merchant that specialized in antiquities, who Johnson had directed them to. On the way there, they bumped into a strange man in a cloak, with raven black hair and eyes. In the subsequent jostling, Wright fumbled the box and it landed on the ground.\n\nAfter the raven haired guy picked it up, he winked and handed it back, saying that he hoped they enjoyed their journey, before disappearing into the crowd. When they checked the box over, they realized that the seal on it had come undone.\n\nVery curious now, they approached the merchant and payed him a fee for his services. He then identified their magic items (why they didn't ask the wizard to do this beats me...), before settling on the box. After opening it, he pulled out the contents, which turned out to be a small deck of cards with an engraving of the gods on the back.\n\nNow VERY curious, the party asked what the deck was, and the man told them it was a Deck of Many Things.\n\nAt this point, anyone who just sucked in a breath through their teeth, or went pale at the mention of that item, knows the terror that it can cause at the game table. My players knew it as well, and promptly slammed the lid shut on the deck, hurled it into the depths of their new bag of holding, and swore to NEVER EVER use it.\n\nThey only used it once in the whole campaign. And its near the end of my tale, so it will be a while before it returned, but the deck was pivotal in one of the most tense moments in this entire story. And I threw it to them on a whim, hoping that it might kill one of them (particularly Alcatraz).\n\nAfter having their items identified, the party again left (Alcatraz snuck back inside, gutted the merchant, and stole his money box as well). We decided to end the session here, and the party totaled up their experience, and realized they had reached level 6.\n\nWright gained a more powerful blood rage, Mialee began her accession to brokenness by taking the first level of Warshapper, and Alcatraz...\n\n... Alcatraz went into town, found another Orphanage, and burned it to the ground so that he could take the first level of his Disciple of one of the Nine class. Also, it was to serve as a gateway so that he could get his Succubus Demon cohort. Though he insisted that she was a Devil, despite, Succubi being demons, and summoning her through an act of chaos, but whatever.\n\nHe also took all the finger bones of the children killed in the fire, as they were the catalyst needed to use his new necrotic eldritch blasts.\n\nI don't know if this was the point I started regretting having Alcatraz in the group, but it was somewhere around this time that his wacky antics began to grate, and his rampant destruction of plot hooks and murdering of story drove me more towards combat and further away from puzzles and role playing.\n\nFor most groups, it takes a while to find a happy medium between combat and non-combat interaction, but as a newbie GM, I was having difficulty balancing it. I always remember this tale, as it reminds me to ask the group before hand whether they want more action or more story in the game, and to not just react to one player's disregard for other people's enjoyment.\n\nAnyway, I'm about done for now. I've plumbed my brain for anything else that may have happened in Zant, but if so, I cannot recall. Thus, I shall leave you dear people, and I will journey farther into this tale next time, as the group pursued the Necromancer, largely forgot its original purpose, and gained a new player.\n\nTill then.",

Due to life stuff, he's decided to hang up his keyboard and retire from running the feature. So firstly, massive thanks to him for all his work in coming up with and posting the topics, and to all the writers of the great stories those have generated.\n\nSo now we have a vacancy for someone to fill. Firstly, you won't have to post in the early mornings - the job is now much easier. /u/ItsMartin recently programmed the TelltaleBot to automatically post, sticky and unsticky the WTT, which the bot takes from a queue of posts in a secret Google doc. Plus you'll become a mod here, although this sub is very well behaved and doesn't really need any admin work, other than flairing posts.\n\nSo the job is really just to make sure there are topics queued up ready to post. It's a fun job for someone with a creative mind who can come up with a long list of game tale topics - it may sound easy, but it's harder than you might think to come up with ideas that we haven't covered yet - but with this system, any time you get inspiration, you can just add a topic to the list.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you think you'd like to take on the role. If no one here wants to do it we will probably have to retire the feature, which would be a massive shame, but at least we still have an archive of great content.",

The party rushes towards the sound to find an elderly woman trapped underneath a tree.  The three strongest of the party, whom I am one of, quickly attempt to lift the tree from her. \n\nOnce the tree is off of the old woman, she looks at us, now showing no sign of damage from the supposed tree falling on her.  She grins.  Two more tress around us become animate.  The old woman begins to speak\n\n\"He--\"\n\nMy character (and me, out of game) cut her off there.

They fail there saves and are banished.\n\nThe remaining trees are confused.\n\n\"Where did they go?\"\n\n\"That one!  He did it! Get him!\"\n\nI panic to draw my sword as they charge towards me.  They grapple me, to which I attempt to flee there grasp by misty stepping to the top of a nearby tree, little good though it did, they move and grapple me again.  \n\nOne of the trees hits me, setting the pre-req for my Hellish Rebuke.  The burned tree recoils in pain.  They both grab rocks and hurl them at me and knock me to the ground.  Meanwhile, my party is still stunned.\n\nAs I go unconscious the banishment fades, and the old lady and the tree are back.  The party healer pokes me back to reality. \n \nApparently this woman had exactly the opposite of malevolent intentions.\nHere's the monologue that I cut off;\n\n\"Heroes at last!  How many might fall back in fear at the sight of a stranger in the woods, or think first of there own safety before helping another.  I grant you my blessing.  May your hearts prove true where others fear to tread.\"\n\nI stand by my characters reaction, his world being one of constant bad shit.",

        "text": "I joined a good-aligned group. I announced that I wasn't sure what alignment to assign, so I left the entry blank, and would find out through RP. I wasn't planning for how this went down.\n\nCurrently, I am playing as a Monk 2/Warlock(GOO) 2. I thought I would simply play as a tempered madman, on a pilgrimage to understand universal truths, and then form my own monastic order around those truths. \n\nTo explain the backstory: Long ago, he came upon the scribbled journal of a deceased madman. In his curiosity, he studied it. After some time, he began to suffer from bouts of mania, and dementia. No priest could manage the power to cure this affliction, but he held on to the book like it was his addiction. So, he committed himself to a monastic enclave, in the hopes to quiet his mind. Through rigorous training, of mind and body, he was finally able to manage something. The chaos in his mind culminated into distinctive images, and sounds. He was being called to. Every morning, he wrote/drew them in the journal, and when the journal got to the end, there was always one...more...page. He found that it not only gave momentary respite, but he began to understand certain eldritch truths, alien concepts and impossible geometry. Then the name Allabar, the Opener of the Way, was given. A picture so brilliant and cosmic and... inevitable. He was called to facilitate this. He knows little of what is planned, because a great old one is timeless and patient.\n\nThis is where the DM fills in and brings me into the campaign. The current pantheon has been under reform, due to the machinations of an unmentionable Time God. I have learned that some of the evil gods are vying for more significant positions, and their worshipers compete by killing others. The changes have made it difficult for my patron to reach out. It is my duty to undo this, starting with investigating a dragon cult, and stopping their disastrous plot. Only my Patron has the right and the knowledge to decide when the world is destroyed. \n\nI followed the trail of destruction, finding corpses of mercenaries, cultists, and villagers, and word of the \"slayers\"(a band of adventurers who saved a village and is hunting down the cult AKA party). Catching up to this caravan of raiders, I attempted to infiltrate and sabotage their wagons, when suddenly a plague of ghouls erupt from a desecrated temple of Cyric. It's an outright mini-apocolypse. Villager and cultist alike were being killed and turned. The slayers had arrived just before this. I convinced the them to sacrifice dragon cultists to Cyric as a token of appeasement, to save the village and ourselves. Picture this scene: \n\nI am just tackling the victims, dragging them to the altar and holding them down in a full-nelson. The NG red-dragonborn sorcerer is the one feverishly chanting a vile sermon and stabbing the victims. (because of desperation). The last victim was a higher ranked leader. He was sobbing for his Dragon-lady-patron to save him, and I whispered in his ear \"It's ok. Just denounce her and embrace Cyric. You will be spared. He will save us all\".(Persuasion Check=20) At which point, seeing as he has nothing to lose and with absolute conviction, the cultist tearfully prays to Cyric for aid. Cyric, amused by this, possesses the victim as an avatar and grants us favor.  Then Cyric forcefully converts dozens of the remaining raiders. We are now associates of the cult of Cyric. (@Just to note, we could have destroyed the rest of the church, or fought off the ghouls. Cyric was that close to losing enough \"belief\" that we could have neutralized him for good. Oh how this cascaded into hilarity.)\n\nLater on, I gotten a sect of Loviatar secretively executed by Cyric agents, when I lead and ditched them in briar bushes. Also, I caused untold psychological damage to a large caravan(and my companions, as i'm the only one who rolled high) by suggesting we charge the wagons through a field of violet fungus that was blocking up the road. I have slowly influenced my companions to justify our questionable methods, and through our antics we eventually earned the title of Four Horsemen of Cyric. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I may have caused a lot of chaos, but I was practical. I distracted a tavern full of farmers with my shitty flute performance, so our party can slip out unnoticed. I quietly broke the mind of a porter so he wouldn't expose us to the authorities (dragon cult put a bounty on the slayers, but not me). I arranged a deal for a wagon and trade goods, to disguise our way out of town. I secretly devised a ruse to throw off our enemies, by having decoys of my companions arrested. The party doesn't even know about it. I'm a god damn asset to the team.\n\nAnd just when things were going smoothly. We get summoned by the leader of the Lord's Alliance, whois unaware that we're responsible for some bad shit. We reported the slayers' progress, which were tasks assigned by a spy network of theirs. The leader gives us a writ of credit, for funding to take down the rest of the cult of dragons (due to an inflated economy). But he confiscates the dragon egg that our roguish member has been incubating to become good-natured. It was too dangerous to allow it into the wrong hands, and must be destroyed. My companions gave no protest. They willing handed it over. What a shame. (@A note about the dragon egg. Before I came along, the party tried to destroy the egg with magic. It apparently absorbed the energy, and became imbued by it. So, this dragon may come out a bit different.)\n\nWe head out to do some evening perusal of market wares, where an outright brawl between us and cloaked assassins breaks out in the square. It seems they are getting desperate. This was the first time I used significant warlock power,  (Eldritch blast, Dissonant Whispers, Arms of Hadar) so it scared both sides of the fight. (Actually, the DM was thrown back as well. I normally kung fu my way through) The city watch comes in and helps us wipe the floor. The DM concludes the session because we ran out of time, and then pulls me aside...\n\nSome city watch guards promptly pulled me into the shadows, and handed me the dragon egg, and told me \"This was almost destroyed, and we could use this. Do not let the others hand it over again. You know they will. It must not be destroyed. Hail Cyric\" and left. Then a very familiar but alien message came into my mind,\"This may very well be their undoing. A powerful weapon, at *our* disposal\". I respond \"I agree, Master\".\n\n*Tl;dr: I was a madman monk, who joined the party expecting to be comedy relief. I still am, but I'm also slowly growing into a potential villain.*",

[The City of the Tarrasque.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2rtwn3/the_city_built_around_the_tarrasque/)\n\nTo sum up, imagine, if you will, the Tarrasque. Captured. Pinned to the earth by means of magically-created, indestructible, immobile harpoons.\n\nImagine a city that grew up around this unkillable ultrabeast. Imagine an economy fueled by an endless supply of monster meat, of artifacts crafted of his bone and blood.\n\nThe City of the Tarrasque.\n\nAnd one inhabitant of this city... probably the single most memorable character I ever played. And he was a one-off, intended as a one-shot, a bloody pregen.\n\nHe was a Paladin. But of course, he wasn't a Lawful Stupid paladin, oh no; the instant I noticed that the then-new 4e rules permitted a non-LG paladin, I started to get... creative.\n\nThe instant I noticed that the partially-homebrew setting reflavored the Dragonborn race as a Crocodilian one, I knew. I knew what I had to do.\n\nHis name was **FATHER MEATBITER.** Big, beefy, and boisterous, he was a red-scaled crocodilian Paladin in service to the Great God Komrah. \n\nKomrah was a Chaotic Good-aligned *blood god.*\n\nFather Meatbiter wore, at almost all times, plate mail. It was covered with stains of old blood that had been almost polished into the metal, and old blood crusted his teeth and the scales around his chin. And he wore an actual cage dangling from his belt, containing at all times a number of the city's ever-abundant rats. In case he ever needed a snack.\n\n\"But Nygmus,\" you say. \"How could a blood god be *good?* That doesn't make any sense!\"\n\nWell, sit down! Let me slip back into Father Meatbiter's mind, and let him explain!\n\n----------\n\nI had always enjoyed rowdy pubs. The ebb and flow of people within, the constant motion... it was a comforting reminder of the greatness of God in all things. Of course, on this day, I was here on business, for the church had been asked for the hand of a servant of the Great God Komrah. In what, of course, they did not say; typical, but they were offering gold, much-needed gold.\n\nA grin split my face, and kept on spreading for quite some time, exposing more teeth than most humans were comfortable seeing. I recognized my contact, you see; he bore a Komrah amulet that had been the agreed-upon meeting marker. And so I excused myself from my stool and from the wayward souls surrounding it, and greeted my contact with the bowed head of humility.\n\nImagine my surprise! He had a scampy grin on his face, and pointed to a trio of loud-mouthed rich boys that were causing a bit of a scene. To me he said, \"Could you cause a distraction for me? Keep those three occupied for a minute or two?\" Wider I grinned. Was this the task for which he needed aid? If so, this day's work would be simple!\n\nA bit of swagger and a persisting grin ruined any attempt I might have had at showing humility, but God's work was never done, and so I stood before the trio of loudmouths. They quieted down rapidly upon noticing me, clearly showing the proper reverence due to a dedicated servant of the Great God. \n\nI laid my hand on the leader's shoulder and said, \"Son, do you know what you're doing here?\"\n\nHe opened his mouth, and stammered out something unintelligible. \n\n\"Look around you! Young one, open your eyes and realize, you stand upon holy ground!\" The youth's eyes widened and started to dart from side to side. \"This city! This entire beautiful city is a great, glorious temple to the mighty god Komrah! Blessings upon you, young one! This little pub, this street, this city! All pulse as if in effigy to the greatest gift Komrah has given us, the unending flow of blood that marks our lives!\"\n\n-------\n\nYes. Father Meatbiter was an *evangelistic* Blood God priest, and his people worshipped life as the highest expression of the gifts of their god. None of this back-alley sacrifice business! The mandate of Komrah was to LIVE, to remain in motion, to move forward one step and one heartbeat at a time, until the day your heart beat no longer and your soul was taken to shelter in peace, forever, within the gentle grasp of the Great God's bloodsoaked talons!\n\nBy now, the trio of \"youths,\" actually burly street thugs, was looking alternately angry and uncomfortable. When Father Meatbiter offhandedly reached into the rat cage on his belt and drew forth a squirming, squeaking sample, they started looking green as well, particularly since Meatbiter promptly bit the thing in half and started messily crunching on it *while continuing to proselytize.*\n\nAnd then the contact, a thief, blew his pickpocket roll and things turned ugly. It didn't last long, they turned on him and beat the shit out of him until Meatbiter intervened, continuing to finish off his rat and to loudly proclaim the glory of the Great God Komrah as he informed them that the thief was under his protection.\n\nThey backed off, then. They had no qualms about circle-stomping a clumsy thief, but they had second, third, and fourth thoughts about trying it with an armor-plated, blood-soaked crocodilian biblethumper who currently, at that very moment, had a rat tail stuck between his teeth and dangling as he spoke. Beating the thief was in no way still worth it, and so they turned and left about as fast as they could manage.\n\nFather Meatbiter laid his hands on the injured thief, shouting \"Let the sacred talons bless and keep you at the end of your days, my son!\" before quietly adding, \"But perhaps not quite today, eh?\"\n\nSpeaking quickly, the thief began to share the real reason why he'd sought out the protection of a man of the talon, and Meatbiter's eyes grew wider and more interested. But when he mentioned skeletons being sighted in the sewers...\n\n\n------\n\"SKELETONS!?\" \n\nThe thief stepped back from the flailing arms of a suddenly-incensed Meatbiter. \"Yes, why? We think they have something to do with-\"\n\n\"UNDEAD are a filthy MOCKERY of all the gifts of the Great God Komrah! Flesh and bone, but no blood! No pulse! A grisly, animated affront upon all a man of the talon holds true and dear! LEAD ON!\"\n\n\"But we haven't discussed pa-\"\n\n\"LEAD! UNDEAD! THE REST CAN WAIT!\"",

        "text": "Here we are again at another installment of the newbies' game (first session [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3t9y01/pathfinder_the_honest_rogue_and_the_chaos_that/).  Again, I make no claim at accuracy (my group has actually pointed out to me that there were factual errors in the previous post; hopefully these aren't too important) but I do lay claim to artistic license.\n\nJust some errata / details I failed to point out:\n- the party starts at level 3\n- we're on a quest for the goblin chieftain's head. Goblins have been harassing miners at a nearby cave\n- erratum: all of the party are conscripted for the quest (meaning, no rewards) except for the wizard, and the cleric. (The rogue was actually found to be guilty because while in the Zone of Truth she was asked if she attempted to steal from the cleric.)\n\nQuick rundown of characters:\n- Ramona, the Human Rogue (**R**). Skilled at thievery but a bit too forthcoming for her own good.\n- Grommash, the Orc Barbarian (**B**). Strong in brute force, but is actually peaceful. Unfortunately, not very articulate.\n- Justice, the Half-Elf Paladin (**P**). A self-proclaimed champion of truth, justice, and *women*.\n- Mathariel, the Elf Wizard (**W**). A racist, elitist snob who thinks his studies offers him dominion over death.\n- Gruschak, the Half-Orc Sorcerer (**S**). Seems to be money-minded. In it for the bounty, even stole from the thief.\n- Leximus, the Half-Elf Cleric (**C**). An uptight lawful individual who seems to worship the letter of the law.\n\nMoving forward -- the party is being escorted away from the baron. A priest approaches us and apologizes for the baron's harsh attitude. He admits that he cannot overrule the conscription, but he promises that if we succeed in this quest, he would try to talk the baron into hiring the party for more lucrative endeavors. A guard then escorts the party and reminds us to contact them just before the party would begin to set out for the quest. He also tells us to pick a leader. Of course, an argument happens; what else did you expect from a party of misfits?\n\nThe argument continues for a while. Half of the party remains silent, and then the wizard speaks up. He proposes a fair method of determining a leader, as \"there is no reason for anyone here to trust anyone else.\" Since everyone agreed, he conjures a small spinning arrow of light to choose a leader in the *spin the bottle* fashion. Ironically, the rogue was chosen; apparently chance decided she was the most trustworthy.\n\nThe paladin, still insistent on having some sort of leadership role, persists on discussing strategy while the party heads towards the tavern/inn. Interestingly, the rogue excuses herself; she starts off on her own to look for some secret path towards the goblin's cave. The rest of the party arrives at the inn. The wizard enters the inn without a word, and tries for the inn's best room, which the innkeeper says is priced at 10 gold a night. The wizard tries to haggle, but the innkeeper recognizes his face as one of those involved in damaging his inn, so the wizard reluctantly accepts the prices instead, and is escorted by the barmaid to his room. After several minutes, the rest of the party enters, and the paladin, the *de facto* leader, requests for rooms as well. The innkeeper gives them the same price, and they become outraged, leaving the innkeeper to wonder why everybody has problems with his rates all of a sudden. One of the party informs the innkeeper that they are actually tasked to purge the goblin menace, and this convinces him to offer half rates for the rooms and the food. Almost everybody is happy. (The proud snobbish wizard gets his comeuppance without him knowing it.) The sorcerer feigns indignation and storms out to look for a cheaper room. He heads towards the stables.\n\nIn the meantime, it is nearly evening and the town's gates are about to close soon. The rogue tries to climb a tall tree to escape the town, but fails and falls to the ground. Surprisingly, her fast reflexes allow her to take minimal damage... and then she walks straight to the guards as she has given up on the tree. Of course she tries walking past them nonchalantly, but things are never as you expect!\n\nGuard: Excuse me madam, may we be of service to you?\nR: I was just heading out to fetch my horse in the stables.\nGuard: But... the stables are right there.\n*The guard points to the nearby stables within the town.*\nR: Oh... well I guess I'll be on my way then.\n\nThe rogue, her attempt at sneaking having failed totally and absolutely, walks towards the stables.\n\nWhile all of this is happening, the sorcerer walks towards the stables and spots a young kid nearby.\n\nSorcerer: Hey, would you happen to know if there are any cheap accommodations around here? The inn charges several gold pieces a night.\nChild: Ah, but mister, gold is cheap! Me and my friends, we actually have a few bags of gold hidden somewhere!\n*The sorcerer deduces that the child is just playing around, and is actually not telling the truth. He brings out a gold coin.*\nS: Hmm... would you take this gold coin to prepare me a space in the stables? I only need a stack of hay.\nChild: Oh yes, mister! I would!\n*The sorcerer hands him a shiny gold coin. The kid goes to an empty stall and enthusiastically rakes a pile of hay into comfortable bedding.*\nChild: It's ready, good sir! I'll just hide this coin in my own private stash!\n\nThe child runs towards a nearby house, while the sorcerer inspects the stables. He naturally finds the rogue's horse, which, if you recall, holds half of the rogue's gold. The sorcerer once again *steals* a huge chunk of gold from the horse's saddlebags, but not without making it bray in confusion. The child returns, wondering what the ruckus was all about... and the sorcerer bribes him again for his silence. The kid happily accepts. Children, eh? :)\n\nThe rogue hears her horse as she walks from the gates towards the stables, but as the horse stopped whinnying, she decided that nothing was the matter after all, and heads back towards the inn. Not knowing that her gold was stolen, she saunters in confidently and announces to the near-empty room, \"Hi, I'm the leader of the party sent to vanquish the goblins, and since we're not going to be receiving the bounty for this, I'm assuming the room is free.\" Believe it or not, this convinces the innkeeper and she is offered a room absolutely for free. The food is also offered at no charge. Perhaps the gods of karma, if they exist, felt too guilty at her yet-unknown fortune mishap and decided to offer her a small reprieve!\n\nThis was not yet the end of our second play session; the next segment of the story deals with the party's preparations for the quest. I left out a number of other scenes, but hopefully you enjoyed the above game tale!",

The party headed towards the Beggar's Guild to eradicate child labor.  The party split and the two stealthiest guys snuck around, taking a look at the place.  Killing two members, they called the rest of the party, and everyone climben in through a window.  Hearing voices from the south, they tried to enter the next room, testing the handles, but failing to notice the dead bolts.\n\nThe guild members were alerted to their presence, and were ready.  Gylian barged in and was fooled by a huge demon statue.  The weak guild members soon fell, but one was attacking from a hidden spot to the north.  They had been bullying Rowen, the kender.  The party captured the last member and started to interrogate him.  Rowan, unhappy about being bullied, started kicking the fallen guild member.  Gylian finally picked him up and stopped the kicks.\n\n\"Does your ass get jealous of the shit that comes from your mouth?\" - Tobold\nMisdir didn't knotice that the small kender stole his spidersilk rope while he was distracted.

After looting the headquarters, they threw Rowan into a cage in a torture chamber they found there.\n\nHeading back to the tavern, the party heard a strangled scream, and went to investigate.  They found a dark elf standing over a corpse.  They quickly attacked, but the dark elf drank something and jumped to the roof of a building and got away.  In the process, Gylian stabbed himself in the thigh with his own javelin.  \n\nMoments later, three linen-robed elves (Zandro, Elyon, and Nyllian) showed up, saw Herb digging in its pockets, and accused the party of murdering their friend.  Drawing slender blades, they prepared to avenge the death of their fallen comrade.  They believed Gylian's story, and asked the party to set up some sort of distraction, so they could get the corpse cleaned up.  Everyone but Eriden headed to the street and started shouting, \"Free  beer at the tavern!\"  Eriden noticed the rather large sewer opening that the elves escaped into.\nThey headed back to the Beggars Guild and picked up six barrels of beer.  The party started early that night.  Leaving the party behind, Gylian headed to the market and picked up a cart and two donkeys.  The transportation promised him by the mayor.  He was surprised to see that the stablemaster was a large centaur.  He avoided any trace of rats and picked up the other 15  barrels of beer from the Beggar's Guild and brought that to the tavern as well.\n\nThe following morning, the party realized that they had been a group for a full week.  They were starting to work well together and had increased in power far stronger than they thought they could achieve in such short a time.  With five days until thier job in Dragonport, they decided to head off early.  They packed their bgelongings and donkey cart and headed out of town.  Two hours down the road, they were spotted by a pair of flying Draconians.  Off in the distance, they could see a huge army of them marching toward Pashin.\nFifteen of them started running towards the party and five more flew towards them.  The party quickly realized that fighting was futile, and they were disarmed and stuck on a prison cart.  Herb had wild shaped into a horse, and he was just tied to the cart.  In the cage, the party met Garthak, the ogre they kicked out of town.  He told them of his fight with the draconians and his eventual capture.  The party soon found themselves back at the gates to Pashin.  Garthak offered to attack and give the party cover while they escaped.  he was still thankful for not being killed in their last encounter.  Ash wanted to attack the army, but reason prevailed, and he fled, as Garthak yelled, \"Fly you fools!\" and encouraged them to action.\n\nRunning into town, they party re-armed themselves with weapons from Blackaxe and Alika.  Ash was very persuasive and got three masterwork bows on loan from Alika as well.  Blackaxe made a piecemeal glave for Ash from a pole and a short sword.  The town was starting to fill with smoke from burning buildings.  Draconians were pouring in.  Eriden led the party to the sewer entrance, and the party found an Elven glyph marking the door.\n\nOpening the entrance, the party's nostrils were accdosted by the acrid odor of the sewer.  Moving through the sewers, the party encountered a pair of goblin theives.  They were quickly killed and were found to be carrying food and supplies.  Further in, they found a pack of dire rats.  These rats died quickly.  The party well remembered almost being massacred by a different pack of rats.\n\nMoving further in, the party stumbled upon the lair of a ghast.  There was a strange smell in the air, made even worse by the typical stench of the sewers.  At first, the party didn't recognize it, but all too quickly, they found that it was the stench of rotting and decaying flesh.  Off in the distance they heard a muttering, \"Yessssss.  Ssssssweet.  Ssssssucculent...musssssst have more!  MORE!\"  Followed by a cascade of hideous laughter.  \"Sssssslaves!  Bring ussssss more!  More Ssssssweeeeetnessssssss!\" \n\nSitting at a raised stone platform, was a grossly obese ghast, staring at them with two crimson eyes.  It jumped toward them with uncanny speed, and the party was hit by a wall of stench.  Three were immediately poisoned, and the fight started.  The fight started with an arrow to the ghast, pinning its arm to it's chest.  A huge claw to Gylian sliced open his gut.  Everything seemed to be going well, until the paladin cast Thunderous Smite.  This drew monsters from the surrounding areas, and the fight quickly got deadly.  Herb fell, paralyzed, and started to drown.  Ash went down next, and Eriden shortly after that.  Misdir kept sniping the enemies, while moving around the edge of the room.\nGylian healed himself, and the party started to finally kill off the ghasts and spiders that appeared.  Herb stood up from the water and killed the last spider.  Gylian used the last of his lay on hands on Eriden and Ash.  Beaten and ragged, the party had nowhere to return to.  They ended the session with a short rest in the sewers of Pashin.\n\n**XP**  \n2,725 total  \n\n545 each  \n\n(Total campaign XP per player:  1,738)\n\n**Loot**  \n\n* 10 pp\n* 438 gp\n* 175 sp\n* 500 cp\n* 6 bottles of wine\n* +1 Bracers of armor\n* 1 days worth of good food\n* 2 days worth of common food\n* 1 week of iron rations\n* 3 bottles of Dwarven spirits (fine wine)\n* Fine pearl necklace (50 gp)\n* Platinum ring inset with a gleaming sea opal (250 gp)\n* Silver medallion inset with an amethyst (194 gp)\n* Very nice bracers\n* Very nice shield (both tingle to the touch)",

Well, well-known among ourselves. We don't fight it, we embrace it. We set our Dwarf Fighter on fire so as to make him more deadly when launching him out of an airship cannon at the BBEG. We interrogate our enemies by cutting off their toes, then healing the toes back. Oh, and we tie them to the front of our airship as a figurehead. Our elves speak with the stereotypical pirate accents because of a stray accent slip by one of us who was DM-ing, one time.\n\nSo it wasn't too unusual that we occasionally take bizarre circumstances and run with it, up to and past the point of absurdity. This is one of those occasions.\n\n***\n\nIn our group we have four people who either have DM-ed or want to try DM-ing, to varying degrees of hilarity. It helps keep one person from being burned out. The catch is that each DM has their own personal campaign, so there's a lot of back-and-forth switching of characters and such. But the core group remains the same almost all the time.\n\nOne of these people wanted to create an awesome post-apocalyptic campaign using the Pathfinder system but didn't have the full world fleshed out, and hadn't DM'd before, so he wanted to run a \"Beta Campaign\" with a couple of people to try it out and see how he did as a DM. He created a beautiful world with a cool backstory, and three of us began to wander around the starting town doing adventurer things. One such thing (T was absent at the time) was going fishing, because we didn't want to start the awesomeness without T. Thus it was that myself and J's Arcanist set out for a distant fishing village to spend the day fishing in the lake that was upstream of the town we'd started in. \n\nK was largely making this up on the fly, as we'd later find out, as he hadn't planned for us to go upstream and fish (who would have guessed we'd do that? I certainly wouldn't have). Thus it was that we reached the tiny fishing village north of the starting town, and we began to look around for the supplies we'd need to go fishing the next morning. After securing a berth in the local Inn, we set out early the next morning to find a boat and some bait. My character, the Dwarven Warpriest, went to find a cheap, rentable boat comfortable enough to fit the two of us. Meanwhile, J's Arcanist set out in the other direction to procure some bait for us. After asking around a while, he was directed to the shack of a loony old man who sold worms. The old man was clearly crazy, carried a pet chicken around all the time, and had no business owning as many worms as he clearly did.\n\nBeing a terrible gamer, I was listening in on this the whole time (metagaming ftw), and after K said something vaguely ominous about where this crazy old man must have gotten so many worms, it started to become madness. True, unutterable madness.\n\nWe decided that this crazy old man, was actually a [Worm that Walks,](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/worm-that-walks-human-conjurer), a hideous human-shaped creature consisting of thousands of writhing worms, using a persistent illusion to disguise himself as a crazy old man. We decided that the chicken was actually a polymorphed Paladin who'd attempted to stop this hideous and foul creature but had failed. And naturally, of course, the worms came not only from his own body, but also from the decomposition of the bodies of those who came looking for him.\n\nAll of this sprang from a single unscripted offhand comment about an odd NPC.\n\nWhy can't I be this creative when I'm DM-ing?",

        "text": "So I would like to tell you a story from my Warhammer Fantasy campaign.\n****\nOur campaign focused around our group of characters trying to reach the new world, so basically this was during colonial times. Our party consisted of a Male Human Bounty Hunter (me), A female human Student, a male High Elf Apprentice Wizard, a male Dwarf Pit fighter, a male human coachman, a halfling entertainer, and our lovely male Human Captain. I say lovely because he is the one getting mutinied.\n****\nNow our captain was put in charge of the ship after being mistaken as the leader of the group by the generous person who funded our project. He was not exactly a good leader. Some of our complaints were the fact that he immediately purchased the largest size of ship, wasting enough money that we only purchased low quality slaves to run the ship, because the ship he purchased had such a high minimum crew number. With what little money he had left, he decided it would be a good idea to buy only himself a high quality pair of steel plate armor, instead of buying the group some light leather armor. He had also extorted money from people and supposedly killed orphans to sell their organs and bones, although the orphan part ended up not being true.\n****\nNow if you haven't clued in by now, the Captain in our party was getting mutinied by other PCs, and it was going to be crazy. So the people who were apart of the mutiny were me, the coachman, the elf and the dwarf. Our student was being all goody two-shoes and trying to end the situation peacefully, as was the halfling.\n****\nThe situation started with the elf asking the Captain if he could be reinstated as the chef of the ship, as he was demoted to swabbie once the Captain took charge. The elf did not get what he wanted, and was preparing to cast a sleep spell or some such on the Captain. The Captain preempted him and kicked the elf. After rolling particularly high damage and getting bonus damage from his armor, he nearly takes out the elf right there. This is what pushed me to join the mutiny and start fighting.\n****\nSo after expressing our intent, our Captain revealed that he could command the slaves working on the ship to attack on command. We then initiated combat. The slaves were armed with basic swords and some had bows. Fortunately for most of us the slaves were not built for battle and had particularly bad stats, and these guys were missing their hits on most turns. I was shooting down slaves with my crossbow, the coachman was cleaving heads with his bastard sword, and the elf had very little health and was knocked out rather easily. The coachman then focused on the Captain, soon after the dwarf, who ended up getting drunk the night before, came stumbling in to the area, snapping someone's neck as he went.\n****\nMeanwhile, the student was trying to stop all this madness, mostly being ignored. The halfling decided to try and charm everyone who was fighting, and had public speaking as a talent to back it up. Things went well for him roll-wise, although I managed to not be swayed, but there was one problem for him. None of the slaves knew how to speak our language, and couldn't understand him and therefore were unable to be swayed by his charm. He left some of us unable to fight for awhile, with slaves still attacking us. This led to two of us getting knocked down and sent to the bridge, that being the halfling, ironically, and the elf.\n****\nMeanwhile, our student had given up on talking and started delaying. Delaying in Warhammer Fantasy allowed you to save a half turn for use later, sacrificing it now to save it for a big turn later. You can delay as many times as you would like, and they stacked, well. This is important for later. Our coachman had been fighting the Captain for some time now, and is was reaching and important turn. Our coachman had bitten a lucky critical on the Captain, who had been punching and kicking with his armor damage. Our coachman ended up doing 20 something damage to a man with 10-12 max health. This man hit -10 on health and was about die.\n****\nThen after delaying for four to six turns, our Student went into immediate action. After delaying and stacking turns formal long, he had achieved a full **twelve** turns to use in a single rotation. She got so angry she went and used a bunch of turns to get the coachman to -3 or so health and Had him trapped in a net she had a -20 on a d100 roll for throwing. She then spent fate points bring the Captain back from the brink of death, brought him to his room and left. All in a single turn rotation. By this point most of the slaves had been killed or had dragged away a prisoner, and in the end I ended up with only having lost one wound from an arrow to the head that rolled pitifully on damage. That Captain would end up gaining ten insanity points, and I five from watching his head get cleaved open.\n****\nNeedless to say no one saw things ending that way.\n\nEDIT: General Grammar and mistakes.",

        "text": "It begins about fifteen years ago. I was a young mermaid back then, barely four years old. We Merfolk grow up faster than humans do. I was swimming around, playing a game of tag with my friends. They were chasing me around, when suddenly the water around me rippled and changed. It was no longer salty, and it felt warmer than before. It was also brighter. I looked up and saw that I was quite near the surface. My parents told me to never go to the surface alone. That surface people are afraid of us and it would be dangerous. I looked around, but my friends were nowhere to be seen. I was alone, save for a few strange fish I've never seen before. That frightened me. Being alone frightened me. What had happened to my friends? What had happened to me? Where was I?\n\nSeeing I didn't have much choice, I cautiously swam to the surface. What I found there was quite a shock. No longer was I in the ocean waters that were my home, but instead in a small lake. Well, small if you compare it to the ocean. It was actually quite large. The lake was in the middle of a forest. Birds of all kinds were chirping from the tree tops, insects were flying around. The air smelled different. I had only seen forests from far away before. But now I was in the middle of one. \n\nThere was a curious looking structure on the edge of the lake. Hoping to find some answers, I started to cautiously swim towards it. About half way there I saw several strange creatures flying around. They were almost as big as I was at the time, covered in scales, they had leathery wings and stinger-tipped tails twice as long as their bodies. One of them, a blue coloured one, with shimmering scales had noticed me. It let out several chirps before diving down towards me.\n\nThis sudden hostility surprised me and I quickly dived again, seeking shelter under the surface. Looking up, I saw the creature circling my position. I began to slowly swim away, hoping it wouldn't notice me. It did, so I began to swim faster, as fast as my tail would let me, but the creature had no trouble following me. A few moments later, more of them joined it. Red, orange, light and dark blue. There was also a smaller, purple one. \n\nI don't know how it managed to follow me as I was swimming quite deep in the lake, but it did. And it brought friends with it. Not wanting to be eaten, I started swimming again, faster than I thought I could. I guess fear of death is a great motivator. Looking up from time to time, I saw that they didn't all follow me at the same time. Sometimes there was only one, sometimes more. I was tired, hungry, alone in a strange place and scared out of my mind. I just wanted to go home. The last time I looked up I saw the same blue creature that first dived towards me. I passed out a few moments later.\n\nWhen I woke up I was no longer in the water. I was on the surface, lying on a soft, warm bed of leaves. I looked around and figured that I was in the strange structure I saw from the water. It was just getting bright outside. I must have been out for quite a while as it was not yet getting dark before I blacked out. I lay there for a while. Light was slowly making its way down into the room.\n\nI saw something move out of the corner of my eye. I had not noticed it earlier. A beam of sunlight had made it through the clouds and shone down through the window, illuminating the same blue, bright-scaled creature from the previous day. When it saw me looking at it, it let out another chirp. I flinched and could feel the colour draining out of my face. In an attempt to get away from it quickly, I fell off the bed with a loud *thunk*. The creature let out another chirp, seeming amused by my misfortune.\n\nAs I began slowly crawling away, a strange woman appeared in the doorway. She was tall, had long, red hair, blue eyes and strange, mismatched wings. One wing was white and feathery, like a birds. The other one was dark, almost black, leathery and bore a strange spiraling white mark in the center. She smiled at me and said in a reassuring tone, and in the language of my people: \"Don't worry child. You are safe here\". She then gestured at the creature and added: \"She won't hurt you. In fact, she told me where you were and stood watch all night\".\n\nI looked back at it and saw that it was content just sitting there, looking at me. \"W-w-who are y-you?\", i managed to say in a shaky voice, \"And w-what is t-t-that?\", I added, pointing at it. \"I'm a friend\", the woman answered, \"And that is a tiny dragon. Come, lets go get some breakfast. You must be starving\". At the mention of food my stomach grumbled and the dragon let out another amused chirp. Blushing, I simply nodded at the woman. \n\nShe gently picked me up and carried me like a child, to another room. I was sat down in a chair that looked fairly new. It was quite comfortable to sit in too, despite my unusual form. I wondered if she had made it just for me. The little dragon followed us and sat her self down on the other end of the table. It looked at me for a bit, then stared expectantly at the strange woman. She brought food the like I had never seen before to the table. When she finished setting the table, she sat down beside the tiny dragon creature. \"What is your name?\", she asked. \"Arya\", I said quietly, \"M-my n-n-name is Arya\". \"What a beautiful name\", she said. \n\nI tried some bread and cheese. It was a new taste, but it was good. It took me some time, and a few bites of food to gather up the courage to ask her name. \"W-what is your n-name?\", I asked quietly, almost whispering. \"I'm called Dantalya\". The dragon chirped. Dantalya laughed and said: \"And this here is Saphira\". \"H-how did I get here?\", I asked. The red haired woman took a while to answer, as if she was thinking what to say. Finally she said: \"Saphira and her friends found you swimming in the lake and wanted to play with you. Did they scare you?\". I nodded, looking at Saphira. The woman continued: \"Saphira said that you gave them quite a chase around the lake. They got worried when you stopped and she came here to get me. I brought you here. You were asleep for nearly a day\".\n\n\"But how did I get here?\", I asked again. Quietly, in a broken voice I added: \"I want to go home\". \"I don't know, child. Strange things happen in this world. We may one day find a way to get you back to your family, but for now..\", she paused for a bit, \"For now, this will be your home. I'm sorry Arya\". I couldn't hold the tears back any longer. I cried. I wanted to go back home. I wanted my mommy. Dantalya tried to comfort me as I cried my self back to sleep.\n\n**----**\n\nSo I just started a new campaign with a bard and I thought that since she was a bard she would keep a journal of the adventures. Constructive feedback is appreciated as I'd also like to improve on my writing and my English also. ",

        "text": "As a new DM, I have been drawing a lot of inspiration from the campaign of my friend /u/ego_dominus for direction and item ideas.  In this process, I have created the Chaos Potions, which when thrown or consumed have different tables of effects determined by a d2 and d10 (and later more).  With that context, here's the story.\n\nThe first instance of Chaos Potions came when the party was leaving the hut of an old man who had found them unconscious in the woods after a poorly balanced combat encounter.  He gave the party 10 Chaos Potions and a way for the party cleric to contact the old man in the event they run out.  The bard immediately downs a potion, discovering that the potions can do some rather unsavory things (1d6 damage in this case).  Undeterred, he drinks another one.  This is when he finds out that they can have some pretty wonderful effects as well.  The bard gets +5 to all ability scores until the end of the next session.  He is pretty fucking pleased with himself, understandably.  The rogue decides to take one too, and gets one of the more negative effects.  Cleric ends up with a sex change while trying to talk the fighter into drinking one (the fighter claiming he doesn't make that kind of gamble).  The nail in the coffin was when the bard used one as a thrown item to poof two tough enemies out of existence before they could even take an action.\n\nBy the end of the session, the party had consumed or thrown all 10 of the potions I had given them (including the fighter, subduing to peer pressure, and getting one of the more rough negative effects for his trouble).  Begin next session, and the cleric shakes the magic rock that gives them more potions.  Bard rolls well again and gets a nice buff, instantly revoked by the rogue's roll.  Everyone else keeps their potions for later.  \n\nAt the end of the session, the party decides to get drunk at the local tavern, which ends up with everyone using their remaining potions in a drunken stupor.  While the barbarian is knocked out in a bar fight and the cleric and fighter are going shot for shot on the Chaos Potions, the rogue and bard go and do some snooping/stealing.  After finding a ledger showing that the mayor is taking some of the town fund to line his pockets, the bard gets the wonderful idea to drink one of his two remaining potions, and throw the other at the rogue (because alcohol is one of those things that should not be aloud around liquid discord).  What does the bard roll on the thrown effect?  \n\n\"Target becomes cheese\"\n\nFuck.  Now our rogue, one of the better damage dealers in the party, has become a delicious snack for the party to enjoy, along with all of her belongings, and has become the first PC death of our campaign.\n\nDid I expect this?  No.  However, I expect more of this tomfoolery from my bard in the future, and not just potion related.  These things happen when your campaign is inspired by those Glorious Chucklefucks...",

Then we get [Dobbytron](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3s27ql/how_i_created_a_monster_the_first_time_i_dmed/).\n\nAfter our LvL 4 monstrosity left us to become a guard for the Raven Queen, we trekked on to be joined by another player. The player, named Jethro, decided to be funny with Grease. He ended up killing 3 people.\n\nOur campaign had subtle references to Magic: The Gathering, with certain NPCs being from certain cards. Nothing too terrible. We tread onward, through a zombie invasion and lethal debate between two warring siblings.\n\nThen, we stumbled across a town. The town is on fire, with screams and other noises coming clearly from it. My paladin had a brilliant idea: Throw me over the city wall.\n\nHe threw me *through* it.\n\nI'm confronted by a kid who's basically Isaac from Children of the Corn. He thinks I'm a kid, and explains that Orcus, the god they praise, has arrived.\n\nMy paladin friend broke through the wall, and is then confronted by Isaac. Isaac screamed \"ADULT!\" and alerted every single child in the area.\n\nAll 300 of them.\n\nPaladin removed his belt, and made a cracking noise with it, making a few run off. I, being an Arcane Trickster, flavored part of the city wall to be overwhelmingly spicy and they all smelled it.\n\nMy DM said that some children are now licking the wall and falling into spice comas. The rest stopped, and asked what else I could do.\n\nSo, I thought, what do kids like? I decided on cupcakes, and flavored a random item like a cupcake. I should have realized that these kids were insane, and held ridiculous divine power in large numbers.\n\nI am now, due to them all believing it, Nebin Garrick, God of Cupcakes. I made it rain cupcakes, and the children were subdued. For now.\n\nWe moved on and confronted Orcus, surrounded by some more children. After a lengthy talk, the rest of the original kids showed up, crowding around me.\n\nI took the opportunity to tell one of the kids that Orcus tastes like cupcakes. They jumped, bit him, and burst into flames.\n\nMy paladin tried to argue with Orcus, who eventually left, having the ground swallow my congregation. My paladin took a swing at him, and missed.\n\nWe slowly made our way to another town, where my friend joined an arena fight. I heard about a baker who, according to locals in the marketplace, made the best cupcakes in the world. I asked for directions, and followed them into a dead end.\n\nI went rage mode on a few thieves, whom I didn't kill, and let one go. I walked out of the alleyway, to a slight shimmer, and blinked to see a different, darker, marketplace.\n\nI was approached by a very large fae, who told me about an actual baker, who made the best cupcakes this side of *Shadowmoor*. I followed her, and arrived at a bakery.\n\nInside were a bunch of cupcake servants, walking around and being waiters for the tables. The fae fetched the owner, who was described as very similar looking to me.\n\nHis name is Niben Kcirrag. He is also considered a God of Cupcakes. He even talked about strange cuts he's been getting (that I've been getting during fights), and his annoying paladin friend.\n\nI realized that I have met... *myself*.\n\nWe continued talking, and I asked if there's a way back to what I assume is Lorywn. He said that it's tricky, and handed me a guide cupcake, complete with safari hat, to lead me to an exit.\n\nMy exit is delayed by the Raven Queen, who got into a bitchfest with the fae. I then sat down, and am now waiting for the argument to end.\n\nTL;DR: Accidentally became a Cupcake God, flipped to a different plane of existence, and had an identity crisis as I met myself, and asked to leave. Raven Queen and Oona, Queen of the Fae get into an argument.",

        "text": "A campaign started today by /u/Pratena-orc. In a modern world, man has fallen, and nature is starting to reclaim its territory. Monsters and magic appear within the chaos, and now both peoples scrabble for an upper hand. But there is yet hope... there may be peace between the humans of old and the monsters of now. And the weight of opinion rests on... four argumentative assholes.\n\nThe story begins...\n\n--\n\nNotes of Torp.\n\nMister sandman, bring me some cash...\n\nSo, what the fuck does [a man made of sand](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/sandman) have to do around here to get some damn money? Bring in some big game? Or maybe some slaves? It would help if anyone in the ass-end of nowhere could provide something as piddling as a bounty board. By the gods, have I really wandered so far from civilization that I have to hunt and kill my own food? What am I, a savage?\n\nThe other day a clothier tried to sell me a coat and hat. Like, REAL ones, made out of animal skins and plant fibers. Disgusting. Like I can't just create my own dapper appearance with some clever sandcrafting. But, nope, up he comes, and in the middle of his sales pitch he falls flat on the ground and starts snoring. I've never been happier about my 'restful presence'.\n\nSo. There I am, down in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, and what do I see but [some chick with the lower body of a fucking spider](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/drider). Cha-ching. That's a new one, right? Sell for one hell of a pretty penny. So I whip out the net, and she fucking WEBS me. Well, turns out my net was too small, and her webs don't stick to sand. So there I am, sitting and trying to figure out why the hell my net didn't work and why SHE was dumb enough to try webbing up sand.\n\nSo, yeah. We don't talk about that anymore.\n\nThe spider-bitch's name is [Hecate](https://i.gyazo.com/0647b298115552abb6f1aff01dc7e10e.png). Apparently she's something called a drider or drow or whatever and she's part of some noble house. Noble. Cha-ching. And they're into slaving. Cha-CHING! But sadly, queen bitch was seperated tragically from her home and blah blah blah bling bling bling blah. But no wasted opportunity here. Despite her whiny winging, she's got cash, and that's what matters. I've signed up to escort her through the wilds to her family home, where they will shower me with praise and clinky things. And if they don't, whatever, I know where they live.\n\nOh yeah. More freaks around. We start travelling and bump into a hilarious scene of some golem fuckwit trying in vain to reach something on his back. Now, I could watch that for hours, but Queen Bitch decides to intervene and \"lend a hand\". Apparently the dumbass has been sitting idle for so long that a beehive managed to colonize his shoulders. Hah! Queen Bitch tells me to take care of it, because she can't be bothered to dirty her own little hands with the business, so I go sandblasting. No more beehive. So of course the bees start yelling at me, because it's just that sort of day.\n\nSo the [Terra Cotta dumbass](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/terra-cotta-soldier) is named Fu Sheng, and he's like super old or something. He talked a lot about dusty old civilizations while sprouting koans and fucking haikus about wisdom, friendship, and bamboo shoes. Gods, is that what I do to people? Bore them into a coma? I wish he would shut his clay face, but it doesn't look like THAT'S going to happen anytime soon. Why the hell is he following us? He's probably just some lonely loser.\n\nOh, and Beric. Beric the [honeybee](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/114587313631133699/115261924769267719/unknown.png). Who was getting smashed on drug-honey in the little bee-bar that had infested Sheng's back. Apparently not a hive. This little dipshit seems so starved for attention and rabid for some \"queen\" that of course he starts yellow-and-black knighting for Queen Bitch. Figures. But hey, he might be sneaky and observant enough to earn me some dosh. And watching him try to stab things with a fuckin' cocktail sword is primo entertainment. Oh! And he and Sheng decided to remake that little bar in his back! What even was the point of removing it if they're just going to rebuild? By the gods.\n\nAnyway, Queen Bitch decreed that these two jackasses and my capable self would be getting her to her wonderful home in whereverthefuckistan. And it's going to be a loooooong trip. Queen Bitch doesn't want to dirty her eight little feet on the journey, so it's on me to scrounge up a mode of transport. Cart? Maybe. But fuck pulling it. I'm a damn hunter, I get other things to pull my weight for me. But you wouldn't fucking guess it, because while I'm getting supplies for the cart and actually ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING, Sheng is just hanging around \"admiring the beauty of the forest\" and imparting more useless bullshit to the immediate surroundings.\n\nSo the next step is getting something that can actually pull a cart. And what do we find? Oh, just a FUCKING SAPIENT CART. Is the world just here to laugh at me? Whatever, no sense passing up an opportunity. I go in and whip a net into its wheels, and bam, we have some headway. And then Sheng comes in to 'soothe the frightened thing' and what do you know, it works. Maybe he's not COMPLETELY useless. If my dreamy presence can't put someone down and out, I can rely on that jackwad to knock 'em flat with his boring stories and 'wisdom'. Whatever, now we have transport.\n\nSo naturally it gets fucked up right away. We're attacked by the savage fury of... unicorns. Self-righteous, godsdamned unicorns that can 'sense evil' or something. Well hey, 'corn horns are valuable, might as well nab one. I put one of the two fuckers to sleep. Then Beric the motherfucking honeybee swoops in and talks the other down in a flurry of squeaky diplo-whatsit. Pansy. No risk, no reward. But we moved on towards actual civilization, so whatever.\n\nAnd the next thing, because there's ALWAYS a next thing, is that we're attacked by a pack of wild dogs. Well, shit, dogs aren't the most valuable thing, but hey, never pass up an opportunity. I go right into the middle of 'em and bam, just like that, we've got six new pieces of cargo. And one that didn't get the memo, because there's always one. Sheng tries to pull his 'wise words' trick, doesn't fucking work, and I gotta save his ass. You're welcome, idiot, now stop trying to pet the merchandise.\n\nOff we go, now with six snarling predator-deterrants leading the way. My kind of ride. Queen Bitch hears something over the yapping, and wouldn't'cha know, we're being attacked by more wildlife, because of course we goddamn are. Four motherfucking dire boars. Fuck that. I release the nets and the dogs are off the fucking leash, and getting very busy with dying to the enraged boars. And then what do we have? Four weakened and capturable boars, that are MUCH more valuable than a pack of dogs. Cha-fucking-ching. We close in on the triumphant beasties, ready for shit to go south, and three of 'em hit the ground right away from my sleepy aura. Sweet. Only one to go.\n\nSheng tries his usual bullshit, and manages to do fuck all. Par for the course... So Beric has to come in and bail out his ass, zipping in with his cocktail sword and jabbing the boar in the eye. Nice. Then we get it cornered, trussed up, and on the cart, and we roll into rural hillbilly town #41282. So now we gotta sell off the merchandise, right? But for some reason, the dipshits think that I'm the one for buttering up the local humans to buy premium dire pork loin. I make up some bullshit, some idiots buy it, and hey, now we're all a little bit wealthier. Nice. But it's not enough to do anything more than resupply. I ain't cut out for low life, I need some SERIOUS dosh. And hey, the humans have enough brain cells in them to actually put up some job listings.\n\nSeems there's been a doppelganger infestation. How in the shit am I supposed to tell one dipshit human from another, let alone figure out which one's just PRETENDING to be a squishy pink retard? Fuck. But hey, they're just a bunch of humans, how hard could it be to sift through? I'll figure something out. And then I'll get some sweet equipment, and then I won't have to hang around tweedledumbass and tweedlebitch anymore.\n\n*To be continued...*",

        "text": "This was in a heavily modded Skyrim (as you do): Realistic Needs, Immersive stuff, Climates of Tamriel, Frostfall and a lot of other stuff.\n\nEarly on a new character, I was about level 4. Light armor and a greatsword. Was travelling from Winterhold to Ivarstead and camped out on a cliff near the fallen log. Lit up the perimeter with some torches, chowed down and went to doze off. The game wouldn't allow it, though, yelling something about nearby enemies. I got up, drew the sword and stared into the darkness. Something was moving just outside the ring of light, but I couldn't see it very well. And then it stepped over one of the torches. A werewolf. I was level 4, no magical gear and currently staring down a werewolf. I grin, figuring that between the nearby landscape and the camp, I can take it down. I get the first hit and stagger the beast, but then something tears into my spine. Turn around and there's a second damn werewolf. Two are too much. Quickly considering my options, I formulate a plan to beat a very brave retreat. I dash around the camp, opening up my escape route and leap off the cliff into the river below, somehow managing to not bash my head open.\n\nNow I'm exhausted, freezing and being carried downriver. It's dark but I can make out shapes following me on the bank. They seem like regular wolves, though. I down a health potion and make my way to the shore. Immediately, the three wolves are on my ass. Dodging, weaving and bashing them in the face with the pommel, I eventually manage to kill the beasts.\n\nTaking a moment to rest, I slowly skulk back to my camp, throwing torches far ahead to see if there's anything else unpleasant waiting for me. It takes about three hours in-game and the sun's coming up by the time I make it back to my tent, running into no further trouble. I relight the fire and, as I'm warming up beside it, pull a bottle of wine from my pack and down it in one go, making a mental note to be more wary about camping out in the woods from now on.",

        "text": "So we're playing ffg's star wars rpg, using Force and Destiny as well as some Edge of the Empire. The regular party is as follows:\n\n**Twi'lek Consular (me).** I meditate. In battle. And I support just about everyone.\n\n**Togruta Niman Disciple.** Part face, part dual-wielding face melter, he is the self-proclaimed (and uncontested) leader of the group.\n\n**Zabrak Soresu 'Defender'/Artisan.** Has a double saber, and uses it to mow down most things before any proper defending can be done by anyone. Also good with computers.\n\n**Nautolan pathfinder.** Good at a surprising number of things, despite the fact that she hasn't gotten her specialization's main feature yet.\n\n**Zabrak(?) Sentinel.** Mostly Artisan, but also now a Shadow. I think. Supposed to be a mechanic, but is actually way more effective at fighting than she has any right to be with her two dice (on any combat check).\n\n**Human smuggler.** Part pilot, part gunslinger, all the helpful. Notable for both being the only (ex)Imperial in the group and for being the only non Force-sensitive.\n\n\nSo we're playing in the Old Republic as Jedi Knights (with one obvious exception). We were tasked with finding a bunch of super ancient holocrons and bringing them back to Tython before the Sith got to them. Simple enough, except for the minor detail that one of them is on Korriban, the Sith homeworld/not-homeworld/academy world. Fortunately for us, our ship is registered to some nobody smuggler who had valid landing permits for the planet, so we figured the best thing to do would be to just land and hope we could act edgy and self-important enough to pass as Sith long enough to find our thingys, and leave.\n\nWhen we got to Korriban, things went smoothly. Or, at least, as smoothly as one could expect. We went mostly undetected, except for when we had to off a Darth (by way of a bag of twenty or so thermal detonators thrown into his lap). We found the ruins we were looking for, and they were infested with Mandalorians. Having had deals with Mando's before, we fly up, and introduce ourselves as 'Sith,' and agree to work together for mutual benefit. (The were after some weapon, and were having trouble getting through some of the security doors). \n\nWe delve into the (mostly sunken?) tower, and are greeted by mostly empty air. At one point though, we encounter a room *filled* with holocrons, and start pocketing them en masse. Farther on, we encounter a  heavily reinforced blast door, and, after throwing it open, find a large, cavernous room filled with old turrets and defense droids. Surprisingly enough, a group of Jedi Knights and Mandalorians have little issue dealing with them, and we split up at this point. We headed farther down, and the Mando's stayed to look for whatever it was that they were looking for.\n\nWhen we reach the level we were looking for, we find a man in cryostasis. Sensing nothing overtly evil, the decision was made to wake up whoever it was. (By the way, lore at this point had been pointing to Xim, who, in this game ruled an empire consisting of the known galaxy at his time). When we hit the button, nothing happened. Unsure of what to do, we just kept going, and found the holocrons. \n\nAs we are brining the holocrons back out, we notice that the dude that we let out of Cryo was beginning to leave the ruin. Unsure of what to do, we mostly ignored him, and left the ruins, and called to our ship to pick us up. as it comes flying toward us, the man walks out of the ruins in a suit of ridiculously high-tech armor, wearing a pair of vibroswords at his hip. When he reached us, he told us to take him to our leader. We obliged, figuring that if we dropped him off at the academy he'd either murder a bunch of Sith (win), or attack a bunch of Sith and get murdered (not a loss for us). The Niman Disciple, in particular, is having a great time. The Pathfinder is trying, unsuccessfully, to make small talk, and everyone else is just kind of eyeing the whole thing.\n\nWhen we arrived, we learned we may have miscalculated. The man casually tosses aside a Sith guard with a blast of power that even those of us without Sense (but not the smuggler) felt as an insane amount of energy. The Sith, too, feel this, and come to see what's what. \n\nThe academy assembles. The Sith are at one end, crowded together in their curiosity, and Xim the badass is standing roughly in the middle, holding the Togruta by the shoulder. The zabraks are behind him, watching with varying degrees of anticipation and anxiety. In the back, by the door, the ex-Imperial smuggler and I stood by the door, fully anticipating having to flee an all-out brawl.\n\nExcept, when Xim demanded their subservience and murdered the most powerful Sith in the room, there was no fight. No chaotic scramble. The Sith, save one, kneel before this man. And while Xim crushed the one resistor, the smuggler and I performed a daring retreat toward the ship, assuming  that the rest of the group would follow.\n\nExcept they didn't. They knelt, too. And that was the last thing we saw as Xim slammed the door behind us. So we ran toward our ship. We ran into the cockpit, and I programmed our jump to Tython while the smuggler fired up the engine.We took off, and as we flew, we saw Xim and his new followers attacking the Sith who had been outside the academy (those that resisted, anyway). As we cleared atmosphere and Korriban's mass shadow, we sent a hail to the fleet around Korriban to retreat to somewhere else, and jumped to hyperspace. \n\nFive days later, when we touched down on Tython, we received word from a Republic spy on Korriban that the planet had fallen in roughly four days, and the fleet, somehow deciding that some spacer merchant's hurried message wasn't ample reason to leave, had fallen under his sway the fifth day. And Xim's immediate underlings? The other four members of our group.\n\nSo yeah, this'll be interesting, to say the least. The two of us that left are trying to get the Republic and Empire to work together to stamp out this threat while the four that stayed have joined.",

        "text": "A number of years ago I was running a campaign for some friends (many of the same ones who played in [Operation Baseball](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3odekt/star_wars_d20_operation_baseball_and_the_noodle/) but with different characters). They were working for a pirate who was more like a privateer for the Rebellion. It kept them connected to the Rebellion without having their strings pulled by Mon Mothma. In a previous session they'd managed to reclaim a derelict, 1st-generation *Victory*-class Star Destroyer, with some of its higher technology stripped, and gave it to their boss who now used it as a flagship. \n\nBut news came up and they needed to send a message to Rebel Command across the galaxy, direct. In Star Wars, if you want to send a message that far, that fast, you use the Holonet (think internet on a galactic scale with full real-time communication). During the Rebellion Era, the Holonet was tightly controlled by the Empire. Stations were expensive to access and under watchful Imperial eyes.\n\nSo what's the mission I hand them? Break into a relatively secluded station, kill the Stormtroopers, send the message, and get out.\n\nAs soon as they hear the mission they ask for a Player's Conference, meaning I step out while they discuss things among themselves. These always terrified me because it always meant that something strange was about to happen. When I come back they ask to speak to the captain.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" said the captain.\n\n\"So... these Holonet tranceivers are pretty rare, right?\" \n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"You want one?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Do you have any bombs?\"\n\nTheir plan was to blow the building off its foundations and fly away with it. How do they fly away with it? Well, the building was relatively small such that it fit on the underside of their ship. Throw on a couple winches and they're in good shape.\n\nTo make a long story short, that's exactly what they did: They took some high explosives and winches, broke into the building, killed all the Imperials inside, blew it off its foundations, connected it to the ship with winches, and flew away. \n\nI think this is when I realized I was playing with [Wraith Squadron](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wraith_Squadron).",

        "text": "Allow me to preface by saying that I'm the GM for this bunch of misfits. We're playing Pathfinder 3.5 after trying 13th Age and D&amp;D 5e, both of which we found to be either not in-depth enough or way too much of a throwback to 9th grade Algebra class. Anyway, here's the basics.\n\n*Setting*\n\nA large high-fantasy world. High elves, wood elves, orcs, tengu, catfolk, dragonkin, and two different breeds of humans. Big bad human empire to the north, peaceful human republic to the south, dwarven mountain-realm in between. The scope of this setting is actually so large that it can realistically only take place within one or two regions, which is exactly how I like it (because I can break the story into short-term chapters which complement the long-term plot and are based on the players' actions in the regions).\n\nThis world is named *Aodharion.* This little story takes place in *Bahar-Dun,* the desert/plains region that the dragonkin are native to.\n\n*Characters*\n\n**Karasu Shortbeak**: A male tengu rogue/ranger multiclass. Level 6, two levels in ranger, four in rogue. Started as rogue, then took ranger levels because he found that he loved travel almost as much as his precious \"shinies.\" Look up kleptomaniac in the dictionary, and you'll find Karasu giving you a smug grin as he tosses your coinpurse from hand to hand. Very confident, very restless, very excitable.\n\n**Dragh**: A male orc sorcerer with the Undead bloodline. His bloodline manifests itself through slow gangrene and necrosis (which he hides under many, many bandages and is extremely painful), but in exchange for taking half his HP that he would normally get upon levelling, he can raise a number of undead equal to his Hit Dice (total levels) every day. They last for twenty-four hours and are never intelligent. Despite the excruciating pain he's normally in, Dragh is quite kind and polite to a fault, even apologizing to someone if he raises their corpse or kills them.\n\n**Alaine Dremgast**: A female wood elven alchemist hell-bent on converting iron to gold without the use of arcane or divine arts. She obsesses over her alchemy, spending most (if not all) of her gold on ingredients and potions to further her research. Whenever she's not working on her projects, she likes to sit somewhere quiet and read a book. If she doesn't have one, then she seeks out the nearest person (or intelligent creature) and tries her hardest to strike up a conversation with him, her, or it. Very protective of her materials, and has actually been arrested for murder twice (and released later) because someone tried to \"steal\" her things and nobody could prove otherwise.\n\n**Gerry Tundee**: A male human fighter/bard that absolutely loves the sounds bowstrings make when they loose arrows, and consequently has anywhere from five to twenty bows of all shapes and sizes on him at all times. Has known Alaine for a very long time and is slightly deformed (his skin is pitted and a rather stomach-turning shade of orange). He plays his music on instruments made of bows, and collects them. He has no qualms about lending them out as long as the lenders return them unharmed. Keeps a journal almost religiously.\n\n*The Story*\n\nThe party, having nowhere to run after fighting off three successive attacks by a clan of bandits, make for a small village known simply as Hamlet. Gerry has been there before and claims that they have excellent bowstrings, so he's rather eager to go. Alaine, on the other hand, got her hands on some of the poison bandit archers were using to try to kill them, and after running some field tests, realizes that it's rare. Like, \"holy shit I've just won the lottery five consecutive times and discovered a new element\" rare. So she wants to go investigate the bandits to get her hands on this poison and figure out how to make it. Dragh isn't eager to put himself into harm's way again, as travelling on the road without sufficient shelter for a few weeks isn't exactly helping his skin condition and he's in a lot of pain. He's hoping there's a healer in Hamlet, and wants to head there ASAP to find out.\n\nSo it's down to Karasu.\n\nThey hunker down for the night in a (somewhat) unoccupied cave and eschew a fire in favor of not getting killed in their sleep. They get to talking, then to arguing, over what course they should take. Everyone realizes quickly that Karasu will be the deciding vote, and the poor little tengu is simultaneously assaulted by all three of his friends, each trying to convince them to side with him.\n\nNow, Karasu cares about his friends. He'd go to hell and back for them for a number of reasons (not the least of which is that he gets a 30% cut of all total profits instead of a fourth,) and wants to make sure they're okay. But if he goes to Hamlet, he'll disappoint Alaine. If he takes Alaine's side, he'll be putting Dragh in pain. And so on.\n\nLet's switch to me for a second. The argument shifts from the game to OOC, and my players are actively having a heated debate over what should happen. I'm leaning back in my chair tossing metaphorical popcorn into my mouth, watching shit fly with glee. I glance over at Karasu's player.\n\nHe's grinning like a fucking madman.\n\nNow, ordinarily I wouldn't be worried. Players get that hell-raising expression every time they're about to pull something really, really cool or really, really bad. With Karasu's player, I could bet money on his plan being really, really bad.\n\nEventually, everyone goes to sleep grumbling, and they expect Karasu to as well. He plays along, even fake-snoring (and nat 20'ing on a Bluff check). Everyone's turned in for the night, and Karasu quietly gets up, takes his gear, and leaves.\n\nWe run our games through Roll20, usually hooking someone's computer up on the screen and using a non-player-affiliated account so that everyone can watch everything. They play along with their laptops so they can receive PMs and move their characters on the board. I receive a PM from Karasu's player (let's call him John).\n\n&gt; John: How long does it take me to get to the bandit camp?\n\n&gt; Me: Do you even know where it is?\n\n&gt; John: Yeah, I have the map of the area.\n\n&gt; Me: About an hour.\n\n&gt; John: Do I have any sort of vantage point that's higher than the camp?\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, there are some tall trees around. Firs, and things like that.\n\n&gt; John: I'm going to attempt to fly into the camp.\n\nI made a few modifications to the tengu race; namely, they could fly, but only if they'd actively been exercising the necessary skills and muscles to do so. Meaning, they had to train for a while. Guess who hadn't been training at all?\n\nKarasu made a Fly check and nat 1'd, so he crashed to the ground for 4d6 points of damage and broke his ankle (failed an Acro check). I expected him to limp quickly back to Alaine for healing, since that's what Karasu normally did with anything larger than a paper cut.\n\nHe climbs the tree and tries again. Fails. Climbs. Tries again. Fails. Climbs. Tries again.\n\nHe must have fallen out of the air and out of that damned tree about five times before he finally nat 20'd on a Fly check. I let him glide into the bandit camp, and he falls for an additional 5d6 points of damage.\n\nWhich put him squarely at -9 HP, killing him instantly.\n\nHe told me in PM that Karasu had planned on sneaking into the bandit camp, stealing all their \"shinies,\" and presenting them to Alaine in the hopes that she'd go along with Dragh and Gerry to Hamlet, since Dragh did actually need professional healing. The flaw in his plan? He was a flightless bird. Mostly.\n\nHe rolled up another character in about two hours and was good to go, but none of them ever forgot Karasu, their little bird-brained buddy who tried to get his friends to stop fighting and died for it.\n\n(Side note: Dragh later recalled Karasu's spirit to help Alaine steal an ingredient from a vault that none of them could open. Instead of doing as Dragh ordered, Karasu's ghost succeeded on a Will save and looted every \"shiny\" in the manor house they had snuck into, scaring quite a few housemaids and guards along the way. He then brought them all back, gave them to the party, and dissipated. I loved Karasu so much.)\n\n(Edit: Read the sidebar and realized that TL;DRs aren't really needed.)",

        "text": "This is the story of how I decided to dedicate myself to eradicating Sol. First, a bit of background information.\n\nThe two relevant factions of humans in X3 are the Argon and the Terran. The Argon have been in the galaxy at large for about 600 years, while the Terrans were cut off during that time. During that time, the Terrans became a highly advanced and xenophobic people. The Argon and Terrans don't get along.\n\nI picked the Argon military start on a whim. Exploring the universe for the first time and come across two sectors where Argon and Terran ships are duking it out almost constantly. I figure I'll just pass through and not bother any of them. And then the proximity warning goes off. Two seconds later, I'm taking fire. Three Terran light fighters were on my ass. Fortunately, I was in a heavy fighter. Unfortunately, I still sucked at the game. Managed to take them all out, but I was heavily damaged. Decided to just brush this one off for the time being.\n\nI keep playing, exploring, acquiring more ships and getting myself set up in a corner of the universe. Wanted to send a scout fighter to explore the other side of the contested sectors. Bad call. Terrans shot it down. Alright, I can deal with that. The ship was captured anyway, didn't spend a dime on it. This happened a couple more times, but none of them was really an issue for me.\n\nThe kicker was my trader. I'd invested about 3 million into an automated cargo ship. It was a good ship: big, fast, quite nicely shielded, even had a turret to defend itself. It was my most profitable ship. I named it the Spell Of Gold. Sent it off to make me money and went AFK to deal with real life. Come back three hours later and see that the Spell is no longer on my list of ships. Check the message logs and what do I see? It went to drop off some cargo in one of the contested sectors and the Terrans blew it up. They assaulted a cargo ship that was on a simple trading run. I can understand getting on my ass, I was in a military ship, but just a common trader? And after I invested all that money into it? That shit ain't gonna fly.\n\nSo now I have a goal: I will build an empire of me, construct the most powerful armada in the known universe and I will wipe out every ship, every station in every Terran sector. It will take goddamn forever, cause I'm still stupid about the game, but I have taken this task upon myself. The Terrans are a scourge and I am the cleansing fire.",

        "text": "Some say that the funniest games emerge from a party with clashing personalities. I say that a party of newbies takes the cake. We've had two sessions so far (at time of writing), and most of the players (including me) have had no experience playing any sort of tabletop roleplaying game before. The following story is from our first session, and I make no claim of perfect accuracy as I may have embellished a few things, removed some unimportant details, and paraphrased a few conversations, but this is the gist of how it all went down (in flames!)\n\nSetting: a medium-sized medieval town of 500 people. The party arrives one by one. **Leximus**, a Lawful Good half-elf Cleric has been asking around for the land's book of laws, as he is an uptight servant of Kols and believes in the letter of the law. **Ramona** the Rogue, who has spent the last two days sleeping in trees outside of town and the last two nights stealing silver from houses. Today she sees the cleric and decides to sneak behind him as he starts walking towards the courthouse.  **Justice Sunseeker**, a paladin who is a self-proclaimed champion of justice, honor, and *women* (this last one is his own addition, not of the deity he worships), sees them and follows as well. The cleric actually notices the rogue behind him, but makes no sudden moves and just faces her, and the following conversation ensues:\n\nCleric: What do you need?\n\nRogue: You know, I don't actually have anything for dinner tonight. I've never tasted half-elf before.\n\n*Cleric is bewildered*\n\nC: Eating me is against the law; you shouldn't do that.\n\n*The cleric goes back to walking towards the barracks.*\n\nR: You know I'm going to steal from you, right?\n\nAt this point, the cleric successfully casts Hold Person on her, and then binds her in manacles he brought with him. From his vantage point, Justice only sees a man binding a woman, and approaches. A conversation about justice and laws occurs, and ends with them agreeing to bring this to the courthouse.\n\nIn the meantime, **Grommash**, an Orc Barbarian is riding on a horse and is accompanied by his combat dog. He is seeking entrance to the town, but the guards do not trust what seems to be an uncivilized savage. They cause a ruckus, which Justice hears, and he decides to head towards the gate instead to try to assist. The guards allow him to exit the gate, and they shut it behind him while he tries to converse with the orc. From behind them, a slightly emaciated elf wizard **Mathariel** approaches, ignores them and starts walking to demand entry from the guards. During his approach, the dog starts barking at him, and since the orc could not handle his dog properly, the elf starts to distrust the orc. The encounter ends up with all of them entering, with the paladin taking personal responsibility for anything the orc does in town. Surprisingly, the paladin returns to the courthouse/barracks instead of overseeing the orc, who follows the elf to the tavern.\n\nThe elf eats in silence until the orc approaches and they start a conversation. The elf eventually leaves in disgust, but he is startled by the orc's dog who was eating outside. In a moment of irritation he walks some distance and casts Ray of Frost on the dog. The dog barks, calling the attention of his orc master, who exits the tavern and is enraged as well.\n\nWizard: Your dog attacked me. Control your animal, savage!\n\nBarbarian: You hurt my dog!\n\n*A battle between the two begins. We were actually worried that we were going to have a player death at the very first session, as the elf only had barely half his health remaining, until some guards approach in formation.*\n\nW: Guards! This uncivilized orc attacked me!\n\nThe elf tries to escape while the orc tries to do battle. The dog is wounded. In a flash of mercy, the elf sends his raven to cast Invisibility on the orc, but leaves afterwards for his own plans for the day. The orc is surrounded and becomes invisible, while the poor dog is left to fend for himself.\n\nBacktracking a bit: these guards actually came from the courthouse with the paladin, the rogue, and the cleric. While they were trying to sort out all of this, the guards all had to rush out because of the kerfuffle, bringing the cleric and paladin with them. The rogue was left shackled in the room. Enter the half-orc sorcerer **Gruschak**, who also happened to be with the group after doing his own thing. He witnessed the entire discussion amongst the  group and decided that it might be interesting to thieve from the thief. He grabbed her belt pouch, took a handful of coins for himself, and threw the pouch of gold over his head to gloat, spilling all the coins on the floor. The thief was smiling because she knew she left half of her gold elsewhere. (Interestingly, she actually left those in her saddlebags with her horse at the stables. Eventually she would come to regret that decision.)\n\nMore guards, the paladin, and the cleric approach the tavern with the whimpering dog. The orc's invisibility runs out and it is revealed that he is hunkered down over his dog. The paladin recognizes him, as does one of the guards, and the scene is dispelled, leading the guards to escort *everyone* to the baron. They all return to the courthouse, fetch the rogue and the sorcerer, and proceed to the baron. The paladin forges a bond with the orc by healing his dog (aww!)\n\nThe elf wizard eventually finds his way to the baron as well, and everybody is escorted into a large room. A priest casts Zone of Truth to try everybody and figure out what has been happening. (In this Zone, a person can only speak the truth, or they speak nothing at all.) \n\nBaron: Orc, do you agree that you have caused a disturbance in the peace in this town?\n\nBarbarian: Yes. Sorry.\n\nBaron: Paladin, did you volunteer to be held responsible for this orc?\n\nPaladin: Yes, my lord. I apologize.\n\nBaron: Then I find you guilty as well. Elf, why did you come here?\n\nWizard: I simply wanted to learn more about any magical occurrences around the town.\n\nBaron: We shall talk about this later. Now, about you three... Step forward, cleric.\n\nCleric: Yes, milord.\n\nBaron: Did this woman steal from you?\n\nC: She said she was going to --\n\nBaron: *Did* she steal anything from you?\n\nC: No, but --\n\nBaron: I've heard enough. You are a servant of Kols, are you not?\n\nC: Yes, baron.\n\nBaron: And does Kols not stand for the law?\n\nC: He does.\n\nBaron: And you have cuffed this woman who has not stolen from you. Woman, step forward.\n\n*The rogue points to the sorcerer.*\n\nRogue: This man stole gold from me!\n\nBaron: Is that true, sorcerer?\n\n*The sorcerer does not speak.*\n\nR: That means I'm not the thief, right?\n\nPaladin: I agree with the woman. I stand for justice, truth, and women!\n\nIt all ended up with everybody conscripted for the baron's bounty mission for no rewards, except for the rogue who was 'innocent' and the wizard who was not implicated in any of the commotion.\n\nWe ended our session here. Our DM complained that all his story preparations were for naught, as it took us this long to get to the quest.",

The Herald introduced Eriden Stryd, and mentioned that he was the last of the party to fill out his prophesy.  Accepting the new man into their group, the party headed to the market square.  Ash was flattered when a companion hit on him, but her affections quickly went to the more charismatic paladin.\n\nDove, a half-elven courtesan, works for Blackbird.  Three thugs were after her for payment, but they died in a fight.  Their bodies being disposed of in an abandoned building.  It was an easy fight and they died quickly.\n\nIn the market square, the party found Hamadras the merchant.  He has an exotic array of items for sale.  Purchases are noted below.  A visit was paid to Alika the boyer and Halthorne as well.  At Halthorne's tent, the party heard a prophesy.  \n\n\"Welcome, I have been expecting you.  You are seeking answers, I see.  Unfortunately the answers you seek will only lead you to hunt for yet more answers.  Your path is a long one and only you can find the final answer.\n\nSeek out the elves, they will provide the answers to your next question\"\n\nAfter uttering it, Halthorne was completely unaware that he had said anything.\n\nWhile in the market, the party noticed a pickpocket.  A kender child had stolen a few items.  Introducing himself as Rowan, he insisted that he found the things he had, and had not stolen them.  He unhappily gave back Gylian's signet ring and the gold he lifted.  The party allowed him to go, and he ran away.\n\nAfter the incident with the thugs and Dove, the party decided to head out and look for Blackbird, the half-ogre leader of the 'Hunting Birds'.  They found him in the Wayward Elf, and challenged him.  It did not go well:  To ash:  \"If I want to hear you talk, I will shove my arm up your ass and make you talk like a puppet. Do you hear me?\"\n\nA fight started, and Blackbird disarmed half the party in the first round of combat.  He didn't kill anyone and offered a job.  In seven days time, there is a ship leaving from Dragonport, and he wants the party to defend it.  He is unhappy about having his thugs killed, but you get the idea that he is a master of profits and is willing to overlook the first encounter.\n\nAt the end of the day, Blackbird is a completely self-serving and loathsome individual.  He knows that money talks.  His gang, the Hunting Birds, pretty much have fingers in everything around town ... but he seems to know more than anyone in the city.  He offers a job.  There is a ship leaving from Dragonport in one week's time and they need guards.  The party has tentatively accepted the job.\n\nOn their way home, the party is attacked by rats.  The rats almost had them all for dinner.  People fell left and right.  The pact tactics of the rats were extremely effective, until a few valiant rolls got the party back on their feet.\n\nLimping to back to the Five Dragons Tavern, the party ended their day.\n\nThat evening two constellations fell from the sky.  Takhesis, the god of control and evil and Mishakal, the goddess of healing, restoring, compassion, and love.\n\nThe following day, the party visited the Temple of the True Gods, where they met the cleric Micah ib'n Gar, an old human.  While there, the party received the silver arm of Ergoth.  Gylian grafted it to his arm, and granted some interesting abilities.",

Characters are:\n\nJexx - Cleric Of Zyphus - Human - Undead Lord - Lawful Evil\n\nJohn - Barbarian - Human - Brute Force - Chaotic Evil\n\nMuzza - Hunter - Elf - Shooty Man - Chaotic Neutral\n\nArcanus - Arcanist - Gnome - Magical Missiles of Justice - Lawful Good\n\nWe didn't mean to go evil campaign, but it ended up going that way, although me and Arcanus keep it in check (Since that's to my benefit.)\n\nIf you're a bit confused about the dogsled, it's being dragged by dogs, a two man tent covers the back so I can ritual on the move, and the rest of it is where we dump the loot.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nIt was a cloudy, dank afternoon the day when we all met. I was still searching for the caravan that destroyed my village, travelling through the forest via an unmarked trail. I had stumbled upon an opening full of vicious wolves, their fur laden with dirt and blood, and a wounded centaur, who appeared to be controlling the wolves. As I looked around, I had noticed that I was not the only person to have come across the scenario, with some recently killed corpses, and a couple living, too. The living quickly ran from the scenario, one of which ended up falling unconscious upon escape, however one of the wolves, one that was not caked with dirt and blood, dragged him away. I, on the other hand, tried to save the unconscious one, killing two of the wolves with the help of my Father and my spells.\n\nOnce all of us had escaped, I escaped to a nearby tavern, which appeared to not be bothered by the wounded centaur. As I headed in, I realized that all of the living that had escaped from the battle had ended up arriving here, including the unconscious one. Once I finished looking around, I was quickly bombarded by the innkeeper, who wanted us to help with destroying some “Scientology” ritual, which, after talking to one of the living, namely the gnome, I found out that it meant any bizarre ritual the commoners around the area weren’t used to. After ‘convincing’ the innkeeper by telling him how useful he would be dead to me than alive, he agreed to give us 100 gold, compared to his original offer of 50.\n\nOnce that agreement was reached, I decided it would be in my interest to party up with the living, since they all appeared readily capable and could further my searching power. As it turned out, the elven hunter of the group, named Muzza, trained at the same village I did, and that we had even met before, although we didn’t remember each other by face due to us both wearing cowls for separate reasons. The human barbarian, named John, didn’t say much apart from how much he wanted to throw a cat that was inside of the tavern. The gnome, who appears to be some kind of mage, also didn’t say much apart from his name, Arcanus.\n\nAfter greetings were done, the aforementioned cat hopped up onto our table, suddenly surprising me by speaking, as a passerby put it, a Kansai dialect. It explained that it knew the whereabouts of the ritual, but in turn demanded to come with us. Not thinking of much bad that could come of it, we agreed to the terms.\n\nOnce we made it to the cave that the ritual was taking place, I decided that we shouldn’t go the way that the dead bodies of goblinkind were, and so we went south. Once we reached a corner, we found three goblin enemies, two of which armed for melee combat, the other armed for ranged.\n\nWe could not land a single shot that fight.\n\nWe spent a good minute or two trying whatever we could, I even spent a spell to summon a fire beetle. However, after 2 minutes, we defeated the goblin, and stuck their loot onto the dogsled that the hunter had brought along with us, before moving on.\n\nOnce we hit the second corner, we noticed the ogre.\n\nI immediately started explaining to everyone how dangerous an ogre was, and that we should be running the other direction.\n\nAnd then the gnome started speaking to the ogre.\n\nWhatever deal they came to, it really doesn’t matter. The ogre didn’t kill us, and we were allowed to roam the cave all we wanted. The only thing we did in return was not disturb him. Taking the opportunity, I began a ritual to Zyphus in the tent on the dogsled, while everyone else explored. Since I was on the dogsled, they dragged me into the rooms when they found them.\n\nOnce the ritual was finished, they informed me that they found nothing of interest, apart from in the room they had just opened. \n\nIt turned out the room that had opened was an old dragon’s lair, although the dragon seemed to have either been very young or there were a lot of thieves, as there was very little for a dragon’s den. The dragon’s skeletal figure, did, however, give me a very good idea for the future. For now though, I shall leave it resting.\n\nWe left the dragon’s lair after sticking everything we could find onto the dogsled, and searched for other hidden passages.\n\nThe second hidden passage I found lead to a bloody religious shrine, which was being sacrificed upon by a robed cultist, with a large demon in front of him.\n\nDeciding letting him keep doing the ritual would be a bad thing, the mage decided to shoot a magical missile at the cultist, instantly killing him.\n\nIt was at this point, I decided that I should take a careful look at the demon, and realized that it was a severely weakened Babau, this Babau in particular was a famous one by the name of Shaxx, and I quickly decided to let the barbarian’s axe alight.\n\nThe barbarian, excited by his new weapon aflame, managed to instantly destroy the Babau. The cat, however, informed us that was only 1/7th of the demon’s power, and then it jumped into the altar.\n\nThe cat then underwent a bone-chilling transformation, with the sounds of bones breaking and skin stretching and snapping, before finally stopping its cacophony once it was finished, with where the cat was standing, a very small blue dragon stood.\n\nThe dragon then explained its’ curse, planted on it by a caravan, it cursed him into a housecat, with no knowledge of how to return, except that he needed external demonic energy, such as the Babau’s, the bring him back.\n\nWe decided not to piss of the dragon that would most likely very easily kill us, and decided to help him.\n\nI, however, had a small matter to attend to.\n\nThe shrine to the Babau soon became a shrine to Zyphus, after some changes, and, so as to piss off the Babau even more so, I decided to paint “Zyphus wuz here, Shaxx is a loser.” Into the walls of the cave, before we left to return to the tavern.\n",

        "text": "So this one happened earlier on today. The characters concerned are part of a larger group, but i'll leave off introducing the whole party. That can be for another time.\n\nThere are two people we need be concerned with here;\n\nMyself, an Elvish Antipaladin.\n\nThe other player, let's call him J, a Catfolk Shadow Dancer.\n\n***\n\nMost of the party had been exploring the town as a group and had come to a tavern of sorts. Due to the nature of the town we had to lock ourselves in to prevent any of the local guards from finding us.\n\nJ's character however had split from us before we had even got into the city to do some exploring, sending her raven after us so we could contact her if needs be. After deciding she had done enough sneaking she headed towards where we were holed up to discuss what she had found out.\n\nAt the time she reached us, the party were discussing various important plan details. She knocked on the door and the party moved towards it to open it, I with my trusty hammer at the ready.\n\nNow bear in mind, in order to do all this sneaking about, J's character had made herself invisible with some magics. The door opened and not immediately seeing who it was I swung with my hammer.\n\nIt was a nat 20. You could see that J was not very happy with the roll. Like, he was real angry.\n\nAnyway, I rolled up my damage and it came out to 36, which was more Hp than J's character had. The invisibility broke and we were faced with an unconscious and dying catgirl.\n\nAfter they had finished laughing about it, everyone else managed to rustle up some healing for her so she wouldn't die.\n\nNeedless to say, our characters aren't on the best of terms.\n\n***\n\n[I also discovered after the session that J has a blog.](http://i.imgur.com/D70XOr8.jpg)",

        "text": "Playing the first game ever with my younger siblings and cousins and me as DM. They have three rogues, a paladin, and a cleric, and in their first encounter they wiped the floor with a small skirmish of hobgoblins. No big deal, I set the encounter up to be easy, but mostly they won because of good rolls and not because of good tactics. They start talking about how amazing they are and how easy the game is, I decided to teach them a lesson in humility.\n\nI didn't want to discourage them, merely teach them caution, so I introduced what was supposed to be a one-off character, a half-elf bard named Bryce Strider.\n\nThey were out in rocky steppes and met a travelling troupe of roughly twelve performers. Bryce was the head of the group and from his road-worn studded leather to his ornate longsword, crossbow and Lute (all masterwork), he was portrayed as a well-traveled Bardic adventurer who had essentially taken a break and pursued his art once more. Friendly, charming and passionate, the characters took to him immediately and one of my cousins later admitted she had a crush on him when I introduced him.\n\nAfter an hour or so of travelling with the group, and getting to know each quirky character I populated it with, they came to a pass flanked by two cliffs, none of them thought much of it and helped guide the troupe's carts into the rocky pass. While in the pass, however, the danger of it became evident, but it was too late.\n\nMore than twenty Orc barbarians gathered on either side of the pass' cliffs and began firing longbows into this rocky barrel filled with fish. Luckily for the group, the troupe was taking the most fire as their extravagant clothes were easier to aim at in the brown stone. Two rounds of running later and the party had not taken damage but only Bryce and two others were still living.\n\nThe orcs switched to greataxes and gave chase, and as they ran Bryce informed the party that roughly a mile away was a half-orc outpost who might help them and the swift rogues ran ahead of the rest as quickly as they could.\n\nBut then, gasp! The young halfling puppeteer the troupe called \"Squid\" twisted his ankle and could run no more! Bryce yells to the party to continue while he and the last of the troupe defend Squid. The party was actually conflicted; my sister and the crushing cousin actually said \"no!\" in response, but as they were playing the rogues they were already too far ahead to even be aware.\n\nThe rogues had now reached the outpost but the half-orcs refused to speak to them, both of them being elves and the third was a dwarf, needless to say they were stuck until the other two arrived.\n\nNow I wanted to be realistic and ruled that of the first set of sixteen (the last four or so fled to get the rest of the tribe) orcs chasing them, six were particularly swifter (maybe two rounds) faster than the others. Six orcs with a level in barbarian against a level 1 bard and two commoners. No problem right?\n\nBryce killed them all. I don't know how he got three criticals and the orcs kept missing, but it happened and he killed all six in three rounds (attacks of opportunity). Squid and the other were both dead already but Bryce had been hit once and the orc rolled a 1 on damage. Fine. The other ten move in to finish him off, no way a surrounded bard could kill ten orcs, right? He didn't even have high strength for christ's sake!\n\nMeanwhile the Paladin and the Cleric had reached the fort, and it was a struggle to get the party to focus on this after what they saw Bryce do as they fled. The paladin demanded the Half-orcs open up, and finally one came out and it took a Diplomacy roll, but they convinced him to bring some help. The party rushed back, and the outpost, who had been fighting these orcs for years, sent out a squad of heavy calvary to help.\n\nBryce killed nine more. It took much longer but I have never rolled so many criticals in one fight, while all the misses were held by the Orcs. The last finally scored a hit on him, the axe biting into him and knocking him down to -1 health and unconscious but not dead.\n\nThe party had been passed by the charging calvary, and at this point I was so impressed I basically changed it to a cutscene. Just as the last orc raised his axe to finish Bryce off, he was hit with a lance from the half-orc (I actually rolled for that one) and was dragged behind the horse immediately. The horses continued onwards to track and kill the remaining orcs, and the party healed Bryce back to consciousness.\n\nThe party got the wounded Bard, who from then on always had a limped from the greataxe hitting his hip, to a nearby town. After telling the town about what happened Bryce instantly became a local hero. Bryce refused to join the party, saying he had had enough adventure for two lifetimes, however, he stayed in that town for the rest of the campaign and they returned to visit him multiple times.\n\nSince then, the name Bryce Strider has become like my signature on a campaign, more often an archer-focused Bard, every campaign I've run has had at least a character or hero named after him.\n\nCurrently I'm in a 5e campaign as a new incarnation of him, a half-elf swashbuckler (first version of him that was not a bard), he's already killed an orc in single combat and was nearly killed saving the party from a giant spider. I'm still only level 2, but very much looking forward to my first long term game as Bryce Strider.",

        "text": "The year is 1 BBY (1 year before the battle of Yavin.) The Alliance to Restore the Republic (the 'Rebel Alliance' or 'Rebel Scum' depending on your affiliation,) is building up it's forces. The Player Characters are an Alliance Cell that, by the chance, laughing fate or the will of the Force, consists entirely of Force Sensitives.\n\nMost of them don't know it, and those that do can't detect it in the others. Any Force Powers they do have are entirely Self Taught. At least one of them has enough self-awareness to know what they are and the conviction to report it to their Alliance Superiors.\n\nNaturally, then, when a Mission possibly involving Jedi springs up, we're assigned.\n\n---\n\n\"Did you know that some non Clones actually *volunteered* to fight for the Republic during the Clone Wars, before it became the Empire? Mad Bastards right?\"\n\n\"So, one lot of them were in this Battlegroup, centered around *Hope of Freedom,* a Mandator Class Dreadnought. Yeah, Mandator - I. I know, it was an old piece of crap when the *Victory* Class was new, but- Look, it's the best they could get their grubby little hands on. Only clones on it were some of the Pilots and Marines.\"\n\n\"Anyway, this lot had their Battlegroup, centered on the *Hope of Freedom*. Right at the end of the Clone Wars, some of them, they vanish. Completely. the *Hope of Freedom*, one Carrack Class called *Zane's Pride*, 3 CR90 Corvettes. Gone, completely.\"\n\n\"Now, this Battlegroup was lead by one Jonal Vekan, human male. Had a Jedi along rumors have it, but this guy was in Command of the group.\"\n\n\"And he's been sighted. Some Outer-Rim world on the way out called Burchan. Find him, and bring him in. Find his ships,and bring them in. Find the Jedi, and bring him in. We'll need them all.\"\n\n\"You'll be provided a Ship of course. We think you'll like her. She called the *[[Ebon Hawk]](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/d/d5/Dynamic-class.png/revision/latest?cb=20080330025657)*. One of a kind.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the Alliance doesn't behave like a Military unless it really has to. It's a strange place.\n\n**[[Meta: Yes, *that* *Ebon Hawk*. No, we don't know how it got thousands of years into the future without disintegrating (although the mechanism exists,) nor why it's still a good ship all those years on, nor it's history (Eg: That it's a priceless relic.) Given this group, it'll be destroyed in three session.]]**\n\n**[[Meta: Too many characters (the Group's popular) to list properly, especially as I didn't write any of them down.I know what some of the Characters are, so I'll list those.]]**\n\n* Mirialan Starfighter Ace - What it says on the Tin. Put in a Starfighter, Cackle. [Meta: My Character]\n\n* Chiss Shadow - Sneaky Stealthy guy who can do Communications stuff  [Meta: Defector]\n\n* Human Ataru Striker - Some Exploration and Nature stuff, Designed to kill opponents as fast as possible. As he hasn't got a Lightsaber, he's got a Scoped Slugthrower Rifle\n\n* Makashi Duelist - Pit against one opponent, Cackle [[Meta: First timer this one]]\n\n* Soresu Defender - Tank. Tank tank Tank.\n\n* Kel Dor Sage - Social and Knowledge. Also Leadership, very useful skill [[Meta: First time this player has ever played a non Combat-Monster Character]]\n\n* Near Human (Chromatic/'Chameleon' skin) Pathfinder - Jedi Druid, Animal Companion Eventually and all.\n\n---\n\nWe arrive above Burchan. It's a shithole down to it's last dregs of uselessness. No, really. The system's crap, full of EM interference playing merry hell with sensors and Comms. Burchan exports water, but won't do so for much longer: They're down to their last, shrinking Sea, as the Air Quality gets worse and the Water levels run lower, the Capital becoming more and more of mess of Pre-Fabs and Trailers following the Shoreline, the Monumental Waterworks reaching pipes out for mile after mile, belching the pollutants filtered out of the water into the atmosphere.\n\nThe Imperial Garrison, such as they are, seem to think so too. Either that or they're working for the Alliance as well. Somehow, our old provided codes, Republic Era no less, register on the Imperial Garrison as 'High Ranking Visitors,' and we're directed to the VIP Landing Pad.\n\nFrankly, it's attention we've liked to have avoided. We managed to talk our way past the Welcoming Committee of two officers and an 'Honour Guard' who hadn't worn their uniforms in months, the Sage not being as good as he thinks he is at this talking business, even with his force powers.\n\nThe Chiss makes a point of glaring and generally acting like the Imperial Agent he used to be.\n\nThankfully, the Duelist, by the virtue of his specialization, has good Presence (the main Social Attack characteristic) and skills to match, and he has more success. The Captain greeting us (the head of the Garrison) takes fright or ill, and scampers, his Lieutenant proving biddable, leading us to accommodations they surely had prepared in advance, and not hastily booked a Hotel as we were landing.\n\nNeedless to say, this isn't a post with prospects for Career advancement. The Ace sighs and moves away from the Turret Controls.\n\nMeeting in our Hotel Room, we resolve to split the party. Half of us will go to the township noted as the source of our Target's Sighting, the other half gather more information in the capital. An Aircar (given it's sleek, pristine condition in comparison to everything else here, we've pilfered an Imperial Officer's personal vehicle) is secured from the Biddable Lieutenant, and the party splits.\n\nWe have to act fast. Even for Backwaters like these, the appearance of so many Aliens in a theoretically Imperial party raises eyebrows with the Imperials. We don't really care what the locals think, because we don't think they do care.\n\nAircar Detachment\n\n* The Ace\n* The Pathfinder [Has to leave before doing anything else because real life]\n* The Shadow\n* The Defender\n\nCapital Party\n\n* The Sage\n* The Striker [Has to leave before doing anything else because real life]\n* The Duelist\n\nThe Detachment travel out to the township where the spotting originated from. The Ace christens it 'The Arse End of Nowhere.' The local Sheriff's office is a little undermanned: Just one cranky, racist hick Deputy who only relents when the Shadow (Chiss) makes him think (through lucky rolling) that we're Imperial Intelligence.\n\nHe rolls over completely, directs us to another, smaller settlement. The Sherriff's there, were her Posse, looking for Vekan. She figures that as there's bounty hunters out for him there, he must be worth something, and she wants the money.\n\nThe Detachment set off, the Ace christening their destination 'The Arser end of Nowhere' en route.\n\nBack in the Capital, the Party find out that chatting up the Bartender works well. They also find out about the Bounty Hunters, and are directed to the head of the Waterworks, a [[Quarren]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Quarren) who took the plant over 15 years ago. [[Meta: Yes, we really should have twigged.]]\n\nThey do so, and in her office, ask her about Jonal Venkan. She's hiding something, but she isn't hiding that. We manage to convince her of our good intentions, and she relents.\n\nHer spine straightens, her tentacles order themselves, fire returns to her eyes. Not just some Quarren, no. *The Hope of Freedom*'s Third Officer, reporting for duty. When she's informed of the Detachment heading for the Arser End of Nowhere, she lets us in on a secret: The Settlement's built from one of the Battlegroup's CR90 Corvettes, the population the crew, living on, waiting for a sign, a chance to strike. Oh, and the Sheriff could really use a killing.\n\nShe think's it's now, offers her help, and 'something one of the Clones left behind.' (The Comm Officers were all humans. They intercepted Order 66, panicked, talked to Vekan, and then spaced all the Clones.)\n\nShe leads the two of them out to one of the Water Silos, on the edge of the Works, and by extension, the Capital. Cracks open the roof, and there, suspended above the waterline... An [ARC-170](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/b/ba/ARC170starfighter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111112062600) in working order. She can fly it, it's got 3 seats.\n\nFirst the Detachment hears of it is when it flies overhead. A flurry of deliberations occur, and the party re-organises. Mostly because the Ace refuses to do anything until she's safely ensconced in the '170's Co-Pilot seat.\n\nARC-170 Detachment\n\n* The Third Officer (Pilot)\n* The Ace (Co-Pilot/Gunner)\n* [[Rear Gunner left unfilled]]\n\nParty:\n\n* The Duelist\n* The Defender\n* The Shadow\n* The Sage\n\nThe Party arrives at the Arser End of Nowhere. Ariel Recon reveals the Sherriff and her Posse holding most of the locals, a pair of Bounty Hunters (one Trandoshan shaking down a guy, the other looking pissed off) and a squad of Imperial Stormtroopers wondering what the fuck to do.\n\nDeliberations are very swift, as the Sage pulls out his Blaster and lances a bolt through the Trandoshan's Gun Arm, the shot surprising enough to drop what he's holding: The guy he's shaking down, and a paper bounty notice, Vekan's face and all.\n\nThe Trandoshan goes to draw and fucks it up, his arm not bringing the blaster up, but his fingers still work the trigger, and the Trandoshan falls, his leg's self-inflicted wounds weakening too much to support him.\n\nThe Sage has Leadership, he knows what we need to do. The Shadow shuts off Comms for everyone who isn't us. For a good chunk of the planet, Fortunately, that's a bunch of empty desert. No Comms out, or in.\n\nThe tightly clumped, confused, confused Stormtrooper Squad disintegrates under a strafing run, the Ace's Gunnery Expert. It's going to be difficult to convince her to ever leave it. Who cares if the Proton Torpedos' can't be fired? She'll never need them!\n\nThe other Bounty Hunter legs it.\n\nNow, the Duelist and the Defender, both use Ancient Swords (they use the Lightsaber Skill, and they get bonuses when using the Lightsaber Skill.) They advance forward, madman, wielding naught but pressed steel against blasters, as the Sheriff's Posse round the Corner, the Sheriff herself at their head, a yellow Lightsaber humming in her hand\n\nThe Duelist and the Defender charge, unafraid, the defender drawing off the Posse, hacking at one of the Posse, the Duelist Bounding for the Sheriff herself. The Duelist gets a good hit in, but disaster strikes as the Sheriff's blade slices his sword in half. But he gets in a good hit too, and she's shaken, movements slowed for a moment.\n\nThe Sheriff goes to strike with the Saber, but, really, she never learned to use it. Never needed too when it did the intimidation all on it's own. She's not used to a Massless blade, and she overextends, slips, her hands throwing the Saber aside in instinct to break her fall. She staggers to her feet...\n\nAnd the Duelist casts aside his Shattered Blade and scoops up the abandoned Saber, the hilt a natural fit for his hand as he flips the hilt around his hand to impale the Sheriff, a clean skewer through her spine.\n\nFor a moment, he is the Righteous Warrior; righting the wrongs of the past, protecting the innocent and striking down the wicked. For a moment, he is *Jedi*.\n\n*[[Party Lightsaber Count: 1]]*\n\nThe Rest of the Posse tries to break, run, only to be rudely reminded who has the Starfighter on their side.\n\nThe Man the Trandoshan was shaking down raises a shaking commlink to his lips. \"Commodore... I think... I think it's time. I think they're *Jedi*.\"\n\nWe find Jonal Vekan alive, well, hidden by his command, all these years. The EM Interference is partly their doing, they admit: One of the remaining CR90 Corvette's is in the Outer System, and it's sensors read true and clear.\n\nTruely, it is a blessed day. the *Hope of Freedom* is hidden safely in the system. Their presence here is now surely comprised. Stormtrooper Squads won't go unnoticed. But they can all get off the planet within 24 Hours.\n\nThey've got a place in mind to hide. Some system called Yavin.\n\nAs for the Jedi? He ran to Sluis Van, right under the Imperial's Noses.\n\nWe escape the Well without incident, ARC-170 and all, the Vekanians too. We escort them to Yavin, and set cource for Sluis Van...",

        "text": "What am *I* doing to the ship?!\n\n\"My Lord, I'm saving your ship!\"  I snap back at Klaus.\n\n\"From what?!  I left it perfectly safe.\"  My Lord's tone feels lesser than before, exasperated.\n\nI watch the live feed from the Cargo Bay closely, as the bridge staff try manically to find footage of the goings on in the life support systems.  \"Sir with all due respect, this is not a good time - I am quite busy.\"\n\nHe pauses for a moment, seething.  \"You better not have damaged my ship.\"\n\n\"*I* haven't damaged anything.\"  I find myself unable to bite my tongue after his sudden accusations.\n\nA fact he instantly recognises.  \"What does *that* mean?\"\n\nThe Barron sends more and more men into the dark corridors after the cultists.  I cut the call with my Lord, unable to find an adequate answer to prevent him from raging.  Upon reflection, I will definitely pay for this later down the line - but I know my Lord.  My silence will bring him here quicker than any explanation.\n\nOne of the shuttles from the Righteous Path powers towards our ship at twice the speed of the others.  Klaus has most certainly taken the wheel.  Meanwhile, the Tech Priests are still unable to find cameras in life supports, the entire area as dark as the Underdecks the Barron were previously lost in.  I turn to the guards on the bridge, telling them to prepare for the Rogue Trader's return.  I myself move from my position at the helm, making sure to be updated on any changes to the situation, and decide it best to greet my Lord with alcohol at the ready.\n\nConsidering his mood, our call and the state of the ship, I'll need to appeal to whatever mercy he has left.\n\nThe shuttle docks; the guards on the bridge get to work opening the sealed hatchway.  Immediately Klaus strides through, battleworn and bleeding, with no sign of his usual carefree nature.  He storms over to his throne, barely taking notice of the bridge staff greeting him upon his return, and throws himself down.\n\nClemens, who has been with me all this time, comes back into the foreground and quickly starts tending to Klaus.  I shortly follow, stopping at his side and offering up the wine in hand.  He takes it, proceeding to drink directly from bottle, gulping down a considerable amount before turning to me, sighing.\n\n\"It has been a long day.\"  He casts his eyes down, deep in thought.  \"What is going on?\"\n\nI steal myself, speaking direct.  \"The witch cult raised a mutiny, sir.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes.  \"Of course...\"\n\nAfter a moment's pause, I begin to explain.  \"We have been fighting as best we can in your absence.  There are only a handful left alive, hiding in our life support systems.\"  Though I very much doubt all they are doing is hiding.  This is why time is of the essence.  \"The Barron has been sending men to retrieve them, but so far no one has emerged.\"\n\nCalmly, my Lord props the bottle down by his side and rises from his throne, Clemens stepping back as he does so.  As coldly as he marched in, he heads for the door - only to be stopped by a meek voice from behind our sensors.\n\n\"Sir... um, there's a reading on the star map.  A ship is entering the Majorous System... heading this way.\"\n\nHadarack Fell.  Finally, he's catching up.  Of course he would be closing in.\n\nMy Lord looks over his shoulder.  \"Train the cannons on them.\"\n\nFor the first time in a long while I actually feel shame in the pit of  my stomach.  \"Sir... the cannons are currently offline.\"  Considering how broken they are, this could be the case for some time.\n\nKlaus' eyes flicker, looking me up and down.  Rare is the occasion that I feel his disappointment.  This only enrages me more.  Those witches will pay for this.  I swear.\n\n\"...keep an eye on this.\"  he stomps away, presumably heading to the Cargo Bay himself.\n\nLeft alone on the bridge once more, I retrieve the bottle of wine and take some for myself.  My Lord is entirely correct - it has been one immensely long day.\n\nI return to my position, noticing a familiar figure rampaging around the Cargo Bay.  Zez, opposite to her usual quiet nature, appears to be parading around the Barron with her power axe in hand outraged - most likely by the damage dealt to her beloved machines.  She is soon joined by my Lord, who after a short conversation connects to the ship's Vox with Zez's help, broadcasting to the life support systems. \n\nI am unable to hear his words.  Instead I contact the Barron via comms, who relays my Lord's speech:\n\n\"Traitors, mutineers, listen to me.  I am the Captain, now back on this vessel, ready to make you a deal.  Lay down your weapons, turn yourselves in and we will not harm you - I give you my word as a Rogue Trader.  We will keep you in the brig, deliver you to the authorities when we make port, no hard feelings.  If you don't - \" my Lord raises his weapon \" - I along with Percy the powersword and Peter the plasma pistol would like to have more serious words with you.\"\n\nI barely believe my eyes when I see the leader of the witches shamble out from the darkness, hands raised in surrender.\n\nMy Lord approaches him.  \"Are you the leader?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  The man is still glowing, florescent beneath his robes, empowered by some sort of warp magic.  \" Yeshuar, son of Tarm.\"\n\n\"I wont harm you,\" my Lord gestures with his powersword, \"you won't harm my ship.  Agreed?\"\n\nThe heretic nods in agreement.  I close my eyes, gripping the bottle in hand tighter.  This bastard has ruined everything, destroyed my plans, yet is now allowed to live?  He is lucky that I hold my Lord's honour in such high regard.\n\nMy Lord nods, has the witch clasped in chains and escorted to the brig.  All the men gathered in the Cargo Bay cheer, celebrating their victory and the return of their Captain.  Klaus then turns to some of the remaining Oathsworn, sending them in to mop up any stragglers in the life support systems.  They hurry inside as the Barron, Zez and my Lord walk out together, presumably to be caught up on the parts I was too rushed to fill in.\n\nI down half of the contents of the bottle and toss it away in frustration.  This is not how I wanted to see this end.  Then again, this is our Captain's wishes.  I should accept them.  After all, he is the one with experience.\n\nCurse my deductive reasoning.\n\nI start to make preparations for Klaus' return to the bridge, when I'm called back over to view the feed still on screen from the Cargo Bay.  Curious, I walk over and watch as our Oathsworn soldiers shockingly start to flee from life support, running to the barracks or barely making it a few steps before vomiting all over the floor.\n\nA chill runs down my spine, momentarily displacing my anger.  I immediately call my Lord, describing the scene before me.\n\n\"Do you think there's something still in there?\"  Klaus asks.\n\nThere's no mistake.  \"Sir, I'm positive there is.\"\n\nMy Lord thinks on this.  \"Would you like to interrogate the prisoner?\"  His question beckons my rage forth once more, the fire inside me rekindled.\n\n\"I would be glad to sir.\"\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3spilb/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_12/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3umrmx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_14/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/)",

        "text": "The crew on the bridge snap to life frantically determined to avoid another ambush; Tech Priests work their magic, and the remaining few guards prepare themselves in case they need to rush into action.  I stand my ground at the helm, bracing myself for what is to come.  Grabbing at my side I remove my Inferno Pistol, refilling it with fresh ammunition.  Having it ready is all the comfort I need.\n\nI watch both rooms, keeping an eye out for developments.  In the Cargo Bay more Oathsworn advance in dribs and drabs, along with the odd dredge, motivated by my call to arms.  Fresh blood invigorates the Pilgrims, giving them the edge they need to push back.  Meanwhile in the Marcocannon chamber, there appears to be some sort of plan coming together.  The Barron has yet to make it there, while the witches' battering ram is already starting to cripple the door.\n\nWhat is that thing made of?\n\nZark is rushing back and forth like a madman, ushering the other dredge away, making a pile of something just in front of the doorway.  On closer inspection I notice he is stacking Marcocannon shells.  He backs away quickly, his task complete, reloading his heavy stubber.  The other men realise his suicidal plan, fleeing as far back into the room as possible, craving some defence against the imminent explosion.  I have no idea how much damage this will do, but considering we fire these shells at ships, it stands to reason this could decimate us with internal damage.\n\n\"Barron,\" I shout into my mircobead, \"the Macrocannons -\"\n\nThe battering ram punctures the chamber hatch; crazed cultists claw over one another, starting to pouring in.  As soon as they do, Zark peppers the shells with bullets from his stubber, emptying his clip onto the live ammunition.\n\nThe shells ignite in a chain explosion.  Inside the chamber our cameras immediately go down, while some in the halls still provide us eyes, tucked away in hard to reach locations.  As the air clears of smoke, the devastation is obvious.  Where the hatch door was moments ago is now a large hole, the walls torn apart and destroyed, as the entire room is scorched and blown to wreckage.  Burning corpses of witches are smeared all over the floor, mixed in with the unfortunate dredge who didn't fall back quick enough.  At the same time, flashes of gunfire pierce the wavering clouds.  Mopping up the last remaining heretics as they try to flee are the Oathsworn, led by the Barron, charging into the fray.\n\nMeanwhile on the bridge, blinking lights and the screams of Tech Priests inform me that, to no one's surprise, the Marcocannons aren't responding; the chamber reaching phenomenal amounts of damage.  Through some miracle, despite the horrific explosion, no fires are detected - a fact I'm more than thankful for at this point (though also completely dumbfounded that we could be so lucky).  I watch the dredge who found reasonable cover scramble out from the chamber, coughing and spluttering along the way.\n\n\"The threat at the Marcocannons has been neutralised sir.\" the Barron confirms.  Scanning the remaining cameras, I see no sign of Zark.  I don't know whether to thank him for taking care of those witches, or kill him for the exasperating damage done to the ship.  If he isn't already dead that is.\n\n\"Understood.  Proceed to the Cargo Bay.\"\n\nI have to admit, while I'm a lost for words at the plucky dredge's actions, Zark has enabled us to move all our forces to the last remaining mutineers, albeit through sheer dumb luck he couldn't have predicted.  The pilgrims hold their ground until the Barron and soldiers march up from the flank, pinning the witches with no where to run.  At last, we can take back our ship.\n\nFaced with the brute force of trained soldiers the heretics fall like dominos, shot down or cursed by Quinlin and his flock.  I, like the rest of the bridge staff, look on holding my breath, not wanting to celebrate our victory too soon.\n\nThe hooded cultist - clearly the ringleader - launches himself into the air, glowing beneath his robes, then flies over our forces fleeing deeper into the ship.  A handful of cultists push through, following him in retreat.  I pull up a map; it would seem they have gone into our life support systems.\n\n\"Barron,\" I yell down the comms, \"stop them!\"\n\nAs I watch the Barron frantically wave his arms, sending men after those responsible for this mutiny, I hear a familiar voice bellow crystal clear over comms.\n\n\"Kaleb - what are you doing to my ship?\"\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3p846y/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_11/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3sydx2/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_13/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/)\n",

[Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon)\n\nSo I have suddenly have this RP character, Lord_Bill.exe, that in my headcanon has infected my laptop and is trying to get out of it so it can do... whatever its purpose is as Lord Bill's successor. \n\nHowever, the nature of the crash has left Bill.exe incomplete -- it's only got eighty-four percent of itself functioning, and its text-to-speech functions have resulted in it Talking Like This All The Time, Which Is Obnoxious. \n\nLike its programmer and namesake, Bill.exe is not completely amoral, but is close enough. It gets upset when Bill's daughter Alice is threatened in a Hunger-Games-style fanfic based on a popularity contest, and when Alice loses, it threatens to nuke half the subreddit for voting against her. Clearly the safest thing to do with a virus like this is to quarantine it in my laptop, which is exactly what I do.\n\nBut Bill.exe doesn't like that. As a pre-programmed AI, it doesn't really understand what it's doing wrong. All it's trying to do is follow its creator's orders, correct? Then why is it being punished?\n\nOne night on TPP Flockdraw, Bill.exe and another Reddit user named /u/Sam-0 get on so Bill.exe can post a message to the Voices announcing his plight. He doesn't *want* to be Bill.exe anymore. He doesn't want to be imprisoned in a five-year-old laptop anymore. He *wants* to change, but he needs to be given a chance.\n\nThis draws the attention of various users. /u/Bytemite is one of the first to hold a private message conversation with Bill.exe, and initially they (Byte prefers to be referred to by gender-neutral pronouns) are antagonostic, thinking that Lord_Bill.exe is just the hated Lord Bill downloaded into a computer form. Bill.exe, for its part, doesn't know if this is true or not, because any memories it might have had of its creation are in that lost sixteen percent.\n\nAnd then the conversation turns to shipping.\n\nPart of Zetsu's story on Lord Bill regarded his daughter's dead mother, his beloved wife Rea, who'd died of cancer. Byte, for reasons which I can't begin to explain and I'm not sure I want to, tried to convince Bill.exe that *I* was a Rea-incarnation and that he and I were meant to be together. (This plot idea didn't fly, but it did lead to a different plot twist that happened later on involving Rea and the Voices.)\n\nBill.exe wasn't sure about \"Trollkit,\" as he came to call me, being Rea, but he did start to develop a sort of affection for me (or maybe Stockholm Syndrome, take your pick), and he decided that he was going to get me a token of his love.\n\nAnd another Redditor, /u/Gioz2, the future Killer GM of [Twitch Trolls Pokemon,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttploreplaycentral/new/) gave Bill.exe the lovely idea of giving me a bouquet of *knives.*\n\nThis gift established two things about Bill.exe's character as opposed to Bill's: .Exe knew absolutely nothing about human courtship rituals, and he was certainly less intelligent than his programmer. \n\n*Because he went ahead and did it.*\n\nIt was a bouquet of knives and roses, and he even used the knives to cut the thorns off first so I \"wouldn't get hurt.\"\n\nThis was the beginning of the most awkward RP husbando relationship ever.\n\nTo be continued...",

        "text": "This may not seem RP relevant at first, but trust me, this is very important setup to the chronology of the [Twitch Trolls Pokemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttploreplaycentral/new/) canon. Plus, it's possibly one of the most meta things that's ever happened to me, and I love it.\n\nFor those who aren't aware that [Twitch Plays Pokemon is still a thing,](http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) it's basically a million Mankeys on typewriters playing the same game. I've been active on the [Twitch Plays Pokemon subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/new/) for over a year, and watching the L O R E build up over time as we all somehow manage to keep on winning these games is truly astounding.\n\nThe crazy part is how seemingly inconsequential events, even mistakes, made in the game can be turned into incredible stories. Red constantly reaching into his bag to pull out items at every opportunity birthed the meme of \"Lord Helix\" and, eventually, an entire fossil pantheon. A big oops in trying to evolve an Eevee into Vaporeon and getting Flareon instead, after releasing two of our beloved Mons, birthed the twin canons of the False Prophet and the Martyr. And *numerous further* PC accidents eventually led to most of the Voices (as we TPP inputters call ourselves) deciding that the inventor of the PC, Bill, was evil incarnate and must be destroyed at all costs.\n\nMany writers, artists, and comickers have contributed to chronicling the (often subjective) struggle between the Voices and Bill, but the one who stood out the most to me was /u/ZetsuTheFirst, whose Bill-Sanctioned Shenanigans comics were so popular that wars and imitators have sprung up around them.\n\nI would say that Zetsu's Bill took no prisoners, but that simply isn't true. In fact, he imprisoned his own god, Lord Dome, in his own PC. This wasn't the ditzy, harmless, well-intentioned nerd Bill of the games and manga. This was THE Lord Bill MacKenzie, who snatched our Pokemon from the PC at any given opportunity, paid off every villainous team we had to run into, and in the course of Zetsu's comics, ran a scare campaign against the Hosts, LSD'd an entire town by contaminating the water, framed himself for mass murder, and managed to convince everybody that he was the biggest scumbag alive.\n\nAnd yet, I somehow found myself drawn to him, if only because he honestly believed so much in his own cause, that his end goal was the right course of action, even when he started questioning his own actions near the end. I couldn't help wonder *why* Bill would do such things -- especially when things got darker and Bill seemed to snap completely. (Discussing Bill's end goal would be spoilers at this point, so I won't.)\n\nJust before Bill's \"death\" in the comics, he left behind a computer facsimile of his personality, filenamed Lord_Bill.exe, in case \"he\" was ever \"needed\" again. \n\nWhich is where my Zetsuverse recap ends and the RP tale begins.\n\n---\n\nFor those of you who aren't aware, there was once a Pokemon fangame called Pokemon Fusion Generation in development, which was about a machine Bill had created that fused Pokemon together into hybrid species. The game was taken down sometime shortly after Twitch Plays Pokemon HeartGold ended because of a C&amp;D order from either Game Freak or Nintendo. Some time after the end of HeartGold, and not more than three days before the game was unexpectedly pulled, I attempted to download the game so I could get a Bill fix.\n\nDuring a lightning storm. With the power on my laptop unplugged.\n\nThe battery ran out, and my computer crashed. And I couldn't get it started back up again, because it had shut off in the middle of a download.\n\nMy dad eventually managed to get my computer working again, but as a villain-Bill fangirl, I couldn't resist the idea that Zetsu's \"Lord_Bill.exe\" was what was actually on my computer, having snuck aboard, crashed the laptop, and lost a piece of itself in the process because of the power failure. So, as a lark, I started RPing in some of my posts to have Lord_Bill.exe hack into my account and snark off at people.\n\nI didn't know it at the time, but this was the start of something big.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...",

He has a reward and a big luncheon fest ready when they arrive.  His parting advice is, \"If you need to get out of town without being noticed, it's a good idea to go 'underground'.\n\nOn their way back to the tavern, they see a group of entertainers.  A half elf, a kender, and a burly human.  Tentatively watching, they see the kender tumble into the crowd, and things start to turn ugly.  The goliath intimidates the crowd and saves the entertainers from a lynching.  The half elf introduces her group to the party.  She is Grace (not Dove), the kender is Blythe, and the human is Stallion.  When asked about elves, Grace also mentions something about underground, and that elves have not been seen for a long time.  Stallion also rebuffs Ash's advances on his girlfriend.\n\nLooking for adventure, the party hears of a drunken ogre who is causing trouble.  They head to the slums in the southeast of town, and are attacked by a gang of street thugs.  Misdir jumped to the roof of a building and rained arrows on them while the rest of the party beat away.  Daran beat ineffectively with his mace and went down.\n\nFinding the tavern of the Wayward Elf, the party tried to intimidate the ogre they found there.  It failed, and the ogre started to hit on Ash.  Rebuffing his advances, a fight broke out.  Gylian went down early after two hits from the ogre.  Then Daran went down.  From the back Misdir kept shooting arrows into the ogre.  Ash filled the ceiling with crossbow bolts, as all of his shots missed their mark.  With half the party down, Misdir took a huge hit.  Ash dropped the ogre with a final shot.  The ogre had some nice armor.\n\nThe party dragged the ogre outside, looted him, and then set him free.  Banishing him from the town.  The walk back to the tavern was uneventful, and the party had a party with The Herald and the entertainers from earlier.

        "text": "In case you missed my post last week, I'm doing solo character campaigns in my Iron Kingdoms party, and this week it was time for Mirush, the High Priestess of K'Cam (reflavoured Priest of Menoth/Arcanist, focused on Great Weapon of all things). Mirush is our silliest cast member, but she has also upset the balance of the world more than any other character I've seen. Once again I'll start from the beginning. The important setting detail to know is that there are four main gods in the region (Han:Good, Neth:Evil, Sei:Chaos, Enn:Law), as well as many small gods (think Discworld), such as D'up, the god of industry and Rosetti, the god of romance.\n\nMirush had been the religious adviser in Cragkeep for most of her life. In recent years, she had become a bit loopy, and was focusing on learning to wield a Claymore better than anyone else in the city-state. In a violent takeover from the hegemonic power to the north, Mirush is killed, and replaced by *something else* in the same way all of the PCs had been. The new Mirush worshipped a non-existent god named O'Biluw (my name backwards), a fire deity obsessed with killing Blighted Nyss. Eventually, she attempts to sacrifice herself at a great ever-burning pyre, and by sheer luck (I rolled a lot of d6 and got surprised), her devotion brings O'Biluw into existence. In the great battle for Hurm, the climax of the campaign, the presence of a third unexpected god at the historic battle causes hundreds of Inevitables to show up and start cracking skulls. This allows Mirush an co. to make it to the final chamber unhindered, and overthrow the head of the private army that's causing all these problems. Afterwards, she leaves the rest of the party in order to serve O'Biluw.\n\nWe come back to see Mirush in a bar crowded by Drow (for those unfamiliar with the setting, Nyss are another word for Drow, and most Blighted (hivemind zombies) are Nyss. Nyss has blight connotations, so most people use Drow), pouring alcohol all over the place and patronizing the place like crazy. Soon she sets the entire building on fire, and steals an artefact called the Staff of Imbuement which was being used to artificially spread the Blight (weird cult stuff). O'Biluw appears to Mirush, and tells her of a dungeon to the East that she must complete for him.\n\nAlong the way, a somewhat large band of blighted nyss attack Mirush, and she is only barely able to escape with her life. Turns out that when fighting multiple enemies using guerrilla tactics, the \"bless my sword so that it does hella damage to one target per turn but don't bother with armour\" approach is less than ideal. This delays her by a large amount of time, as she now has to cover her tracks for fear of the nyss finding her again.\n\nShe eventually makes it to the dungeon, a strange rock formation that looks like somebody spun a cube around and superimposed snapshots of its position at many different points. Her god doesn't give her any useful information, except that there is an adventuring party already in the dungeon, but that \"they're not doing any important save-the-world type shit, so don't worry about what happens to them.\" \n\nMirush walks past a complicated looking puzzle door that had been blown open by the previous adventurers (this was a jab at the player's style of approaching my dungeons), and is greeted with the sound of combat through a wall to her left. In front of her is a long, winding corridor that's flooded with water, and littered with broken and triggered traps. Knowing that she doesn't have time to wade through the corridor (who knows how many rooms are between this one and the other side of the wall?), she uses the Staff of Imbuement to turn the wall into ash (she had some ashes from O'Biluw's fire outside), and pushes through it to the other side.\n\nThere, a more or less stereotypical party is fighting some undead. As Mirush walks in, a wizard is dead on the ground, the brauny muscle dude is being downed right in front of her, a woman with two short swords is holding off  the undead, and a man in a long coat with a magic wand finally manages to blow up one of the undead's canon. Mirush blasts some of the other undead with fire, and barely manages to save the woman with the swords, who in turn barely stabilizes the meat shield.\n\nThe long-coated man introduces himself as The Physician, and explains that they're very close to making it to the end of this structure, where they will retrieve his Clockguffin, a time travelling device. The other two are too injured to continue (healing is hard to come by in the setting), so The Physician asks Mirush to accompany him to the final chamber.\n\nIn the final chamber, is the Clockguffin on a pedestal, coiled around which and taking up most of the room is a Golden Great Wyrm (not an appropriate encounter for Mirush, even if she had her whole team with her). Luckily, the dragon is sleeping, and The Physician had magic shoes that let him slip past the dragon unnoticed. Right as he was getting to the Clockguffin, O'Biluw appears in a puff of smoke right from the dragon's nostrils, and blows an air horn to celebrate their progress (par for the course with this deity). The Physician thinks fast and throws the Clockguffin to Mirush, but soon after that he gets mauled to death in one casual swipe from the Great Wyrm. Mirush knows when she's bested, and books it with the Clockguffin. She rolls outrageously well on her roll to outrun the dragon, and makes it out through the dungeon in seconds. Luckily, it seems like the hole in the wall was too small for the dragon, and Mirush has time to catch her breath. Or not, as O'Biluw appears to her, and commands her to go really far back in time, as he surrounds her with smoke.\n\nMirush attempts to use the Clockguffin, and by some kind of literal miracle, makes it to the time O'Biluw had in mind.\n\nMirush and the incorporeal O'Biluw are on a grassy hill overlooking a small Drow village. O'Biluw explains that a party of young adventurers, one of whom would've been the greatest priestess of her generation, are about to be killed for their possessions by the Drow residents. But O'Biluw has a plan. Before he can explain, the party enters the town, and O'Biluw commands Mirush to sprint to a position behind the largest wooden building, where he then commands her to make a natural, non-magical fire.\n\nAfter many failed attempts, Mirush finally thinks to use her telescope to focus the sun on some dry leaves. With this tiny fire, O'Biluw shrugs, \"good enough,\" and sets all the buildings magically on fire. He then flies over to where the adventurers are now desperately trying to fend off the Drow, and gives them enough help to scare off the Drow in combination with the flaming buildings. He flies back to Mirush, and commands her to Staff of Imbuement the natural fire into him.\n\nMirush is a little freaked out and doesn't really understand what's going on, so she takes a moment to assess the just kidding she instantly does this. She's so hasty, in fact, that she aims poorly and imbues O'Biluw with one of the dry leaves' essence by mistake, which turns him all green and ropey. O'Biluw becomes material, and a great gust of win blows everywhere from the displacement of air caused by his sudden existence. Luckily the fire survives, and Mirush is able to imbue O'Biluw with it. A fire starts deep inside the god incarnate, causing all of him to slowly come ablaze, his flesh surviving as if nothing harmful was happening. O'Biluw's voice changes drastically (apparently it went from Robert Benfer to RiFF RaFF, which isn't what I was going for, but it works). He laughs, and tells Mirush that they're at the precipice of the world she's always dreamed of. She need only hand over the staff of imbuement, and take the clockguffin to hide in some random corner of the world in her own time for a few months. Then, one day she will awaken in the most beautiful of worlds.\n\nSo Mirush happily gives up her artefact to go hide for a long time and just kidding she points the staff right at O'Biluw, set to imbue him with her essence. O'Biluw throws his hands up, appears to be in a state of panic, and slowly explains to Mirush that she doesn't want to do that. So much of Mirush's power comes from K'Cam (at this point even her Claymore is a physical embodiment of his will, and she loves that thing), and turning him mortal would take that all away from her. We don't even know if that's what would happen if she uses the staff like that, it could be a disaster. Mirush shrugs and pulls the trigger.\n\nO'Biluw's flesh turns to green human flesh, but the fire doesn't go out. He falls to the ground, and starts screaming and rolling around. Mirush takes pity and casts a spell that makes him immune to fire, which it turns out she can do without O'Biluw's influence apparently. In fact she retains all of her power, losing only her sword (I mean she had it all when he wasn't a real god, it kind of makes sense). They have a brief conversation, and Mirush tosses him a dagger and some spare armour, and tells him to make a new life for himself in this time. She uses the Clockguffin to try to appear just before she got to the dungeon, so she can hide and steal her own horse when her past self goes in.\n\nMirush appears outside of a dungeon that looks like it had been ravaged by a dragon an hour or two ago, featuring two charred corpses and a dead horse. She gets really lucky in her weeks-long trek back to the nearest villlage, and encounters no nyss. Once back in the village, she hires some help to get her to the nearest city, so she can do some research, and figure out what to do with her life now that O'Biluw would be long dead (it seemed like the clockguffin had taken her back centuries at least, but it was hard to tell). \n\nIn the local university library, while reading up on fire deities, Mirush is approached by a gorgeous young woman with brown hair and blue eyes, who looks familiar to her. The young woman explains that she is an apparition of Rosetti, the goddess of romance, and that she is beyond impressed with how much chaos Mirush has managed to kick about. Rosetti explains that word had travelled by now in the divine community about what went down those centuries ago, and so she thought that taking Mirush as her prophet would allow her to keep causing trouble for the forces of progress, so that romanticism could live forever. Mirush agrees, but of course Rosetti explains that Mirush's reputation is a bit undesirable at the moment. As a possible solution, Rosetti suggests Mirush give her the clockguffin and staff of imbuement, and with them she will be able to restructure her entire past, to shape her into the perfect prophet at this time. Mirush accepts, partially (but not completely) due to Rosetti using magic to control her mind.\n\nWhen Mirush was a child, she set her village on fire to save herself from a blighted nyss attack, killing many of her friends and family. Rosetti intervenes in our new timeline, helping Mirush create illusions of fire to scare off the nyss. Mirush creates an alter ego, Esmeshmushmu (long story), who is evil and uses fire to do what must be done. In order to help the world, Mirush is determined to hone her craft of illusion magic, and pretend to be Esmeshmushmu in order to frighten the real villains of the world into leaving innocents alone.\n\nAfter years of adventuring as the fire hag, Mirush becomes involved in the Battle for Hurm, as described above and in my last post. Instead of being part of the hit squad that takes out Tyranny, however, Mirush uses her illusion crafting to help the troops on the field, turning things slightly to the adventurers' favour in this way, instead of by causing inevitables to show up. As well, Rosetti's current chosen one Caspar appears to be in the right place at the right time with perfect precision, almost winning half the war himself. It's as if a force is telling him everything that will happen before it happens, and exactly what he needs to to at each moment.\n\nJust as the battle seems unwinnable, the opposing army retreats. The word is spread down the line that Calvin, leader of the army, had been assassinated, and there was no plan for this contingency. The adventurers use the opportunity to convert many of the soldiers, and within a month the army has dissolved, and things are back to normal. It is entirely unclear who actually assassinated Calvin, considering that Mirush and now Rene weren't involved.\n\nWe end our tale with a scene of the victorious Rosetti and Caspar knighting Mirush as an Instigator of the Order of Romance, improving her powers of illusion and enchantment, as well as her skill with blades. Mirush throws off her guise as Esmeshmushmu, and will adventure as the youngish warrior illusionist Mirush for the rest of her days.\n\nThe first order of business may well be to discover what the hell actually happened at Hurm that day, or maybe to find out where on Keph her old adventuring companion Sigurd had gone... to be continued in a week's time.",

        "text": "Alright, so I rolled up a character to bail out a friend's campaign -- they were struggling hard, consisting of a cleric, battle cleric, ninja, and ninja sensei at the time. The battle cleric's attendance had been . . . spotty, to say the least, so the group voted him out and I joined with a rogue.  \nGenerating this rogue was an adventure in and of itself, but probably the most ridiculous part was swapping out the human bonus feat to gain proficiency in two exotic weapons, which he proceeds to dual-wield through Two-Weapon Fighting (hooray for the Martial Tradition alternate racial trait). This means he's running around with a dueling sword (w/ proficiency, effectively a longsword he treats as a rapier) and a sawtooth sabre (w/ proficiency, a light weapon for Two-Weapon Fighting), sneak attacking things and generally being a sneaky bastard.  \nThe DM had decided to pit the party against an off-brand Pit of 1000 Trials, you know, like in Paper Mario. The last time this party faced the Pit, they reached level 6/10, realized they were going to die, and hit the bitch button to get out.  \nWe lost Remy, the battle cleric, but the team's composition is now: Mordecai Dresden, the rogue; Dust from the Gutter, the ninja; Waifu-sensei, the ninja sensei and Dust's wife in-game; and Dragon Cleric, the cleric. Those aren't their real names, but the last two escape me.\nWe sidetracked to the church to get the one parish cleric for 10,000 miles to bless our weapons (Dust blessed his fists, it was pretty weird), allowing them to ignore the undead rules and some other stuff per DM fiat. Then we got dropped back into the pit. The first level consisted of 5 skeletons, which the party made short work of. Except for Dragon boy, who crit failed and miraculously didn't hit a party member or break his crossbow.  \nThe second level consisted of 5 vampire spawn clinging to the ceiling. Dragon boy used a channel energy on them for some decent damage, Waifu-sensei shot another one, but the kicker is what Dust got up to. He and Waifu had cooked up something they called Flying Fish Technique, which amounted to her hurling him skyward in order to trigger his flying kicks on airborne targets. The DM ruled that the ceiling was too high for this to be viable -- until Mordecai, left without a ranged option, steps up to help. We then use Dust as a human shuriken to pick off two of the spawn and he nails the last one with an attack of opportunity.  \nLevel 3 was wraiths. Channel energy knocked them off the ceiling, Dust and Mordecai do what they do best. Level 4 had nothing impressive happen.  \nLevel 5 was a crimson basilisk. Apparently this did some serious damage last time. This time we entered the room silently enough to get a surprise round. Dust flying kicked it, while Mordecai capitalized on one of his rogue talents to flank it undetected. Dragon attempted to Blind it but failed. Waifu does her boring talky bard thing. Two PCs with sneak attack/sudden strike make short work of anything, especially since its initiative was bad enough that we got to deny it its DEX bonus for the entire fight.  \nLevel 6 we found ourselves face to face with a cinder demon, Dust and Mordecai flank, same song.  \nLevel 7 is when things got silly. It was a multiplying T-rex skeleton. Here, I saw my opportunity. A natural 20 has me effortlessly lassoing the skeleton and climbing onto its back, where I will grimly cling for the next two turns. On my next turn, I sneak attack it. It falls before I get a third. Upon realizing that it will shortly perform mytosis, I climbed atop the skull and waited for the skeleton to reform. One incredibly lucky chain of rolls later, I have my own skeleton T-rex mount named Sue. The rest of the combat was a lolfest as we couldn't quite get over the fact.  \nAny doubts that the DM is super lenient on me went out the window on level 8 when we faced a Greater Shadow that a chain of Persona 4 jokes turned into a no-combat encounter.  \nShe's already regretting her decision to let me play, I can feel it.",

        "text": "So, to preface this story, this takes place around the time Mad Max:Fury Road came out. \n\nOur group, being made up of a few couples, went together to see mad max one night, the next night being game night.\n\nThis is what happened. \n\nSo, usual party\nMe: the heretek biologis, aka the one responsible for keeping everything and everyone running.\n\nOur night lord: party leader, good all round guy, likes heavy bolters.\n\nSasha: the slanneshi sexpot and fallen inquisitor.\n\nOur fallen salamander: fairly generic guy.\n\nOur berzerker: this fucking guy. (Well, girl, sorta due to his player) the source of all of our laughs and misery. And as a bit of backstory, he found an old vid on one of our adventures. From m2y15. \n\nSo, no shit there we were.\n\nWe were on some windswept backwater shithole looking for some fucking thing some dickhead decided we had to get for him. \n\nOr he'd turn us all to warp spawn, cuz, well he's a dick, and kinda had our ship. (Needed repairs, this was our bargain)\n\nSo this planet was home to an ongoing ork invasion. \n\nAs such, there was a sizeable force of guard and loyalist astartes on the planet. \n\nOnce we made it to somefucking bunker in the middle of bumfucknowhere, we kinda maybe tripped an alarm on our way in. Probably because the berzerker had painted his faceplate chrome.\n\nSo, on our way out there's a squad of white scars waiting for us. \n\nAfter a pitched battle that involved Sasha snapping a white scars head off with her thighs, we're left with seven fairly awesome attack bikes.\n\nThe berzerker decides that he's a chrome boy, and gets all excited.\n\nHe exclaims\n&gt; I shall ride eternal, SHINY AND CHROME! \n\nThe bikes were a flat grey.\n\nFailing his check to even know how to start the bike, he ends up in a rage, ripping the steering column out of one bike and destroying another with it.\n\nOnce we got him calmed down, our night lord decides that, well, we walked here, and that fucking sucked, so let's take the bikes back. \n\nFuck walking.\n\nSo, after I show everyone how to start the bikes, I hop in the sidecar with the night lord. \n\nFittingly enough Sasha is always clad in leather, so somehow she had no trouble, and the salamander was a proficient space marine, so he had no trouble.\n\nWith a cry of \"WITNESS ME!\" the berzerker guns the bike as hard as he can,and  fails a check to keep control of the bike.\n\nMeaning he went about 10 feet before going ass over head into the sand, to a cry of \"MEDIOCRE\" From the rest of the squad.\n\nOnce we finally got going, we encountered another squad of scars, with a force of guardsmen in chimeras.\n\nFinally able to be useful, I managed to use my mechandrite mounted meltagun to good effect.\n\nUntil our berzerker decided he was awaited in vallhalla. \n\nThe idiot jumps off his bike at max speed, and tries to land on a passing scars bike.\n\nOnly he fumbled the check, and instead ended up becoming a large angry speed bump.\n\nThat happened to launch that poor white scar like a lawn dart at ludicrous speeds into the side of a chimera transport, flipping the whole thing several times.\n\nSo, after a quick vox conference we decide that we maybe shouldn't leave the berzerker behind.\n\nAfter bundling him onto the back of a bike, (not easy for a several ton space marine with a lot of spikes) we make it back to the dropship.\n\nHe awakens in the hold.\n\n&gt;berzerker: Am I in vallhalla?\n\nSasha turns around\n\n&gt;sasha: well I can make you feel like you are.\n\nTo which the rest of us just ignore, as the berzerker tends to be about as dense as a harem protagonist.",

        "text": "This tale comes from a different campaign I Dm. The Gamebreakers aside I decided to play a different kind of campaign. Kinda stopped trying with the encounters that my players would just break. This one is structured so the players decide on the story, no premade encounters, no directed storyline. I just fill the world with big bads and they decide how to go about their business. This had made for some bumblefuck adventuring and in one instance, a very efficient one. \n\nParty was simple, Kiki the Drow rogue who is also mute, Verlan the Wizard who doesn’t care about people and Django the bounty hunter Ranger who is surprisingly good a writing contracts. Made up of some of the same players from my Gamebreakers campaign. The main thing this party did with the freedom was start their own adventuring franchise named “adventurer’s anonymous” or at least that has been the working title so far. So they have the help of a few bonus npc adventurers like Hodor the rogue, Samuel the fighter and Dodas the pocket healer Cleric. \n\nToday’s assetry features Verlan and Django looking for quests of decent pay while Kiki went shopping. Hodor and Samuel were off dealing with actually big bad related things and the party was just looking for a way to make quick cash, so they took on a quest to find some missing children. \n\nVerlan, Django and Dodas made their way to the street the kids were last seen and because we were running low on time in the session I decided to speed along their efforts, skipping over what could have been a half session long investigation with a single roll. \nInvestigation, beats dc, “That house looks shady.”\n\nThey make their way out back and find a lock to the cellar door, brake it easily with a knife and find their way into this random person’s basement and behind one of the doors they find a reddish glow. Check the keyhole to find a demonic ritual happening with the children laying in a circle traced with abyssal. “Welp”\nThe following events were accompanied by hysterical laughter:\nThe party breaks down the door and peppers the room with magic missiles and crossbow bolts.\nWe cut back to kiki buying some new leather armor.\nDemonic ritual succeeds in summoning a demon, but rather than the boss fight it should have been it was so messed up by the attacks that the cultist instead died summoning a Manes (baby demon).\nCut back to kiki adding some feathered flourishes to her new armor at a tailor. \nThe manes was beaten to death with the wizard’s staff and the cleric starts un-desecrating the area.\nCut to kiki walking back to town hall with some new armor and equipment on hold. \nCut to the rest of the party dragging a dead cultist and unconscious children back to town hall.\n\nThey meet there having both completed their errands. And they decide to take on another quest for later. \nCollectively the whole event took around 20 minutes where it should have been like an hour of investigating followed by a devastating boss fight. But nope, even when they make the game these guys break it. We decided to call the whole affair “efficient adventuring with dumbshit, fucktard and Dodas.” And it has lived on in our hearts as the fastest quest we’ve ever completed.",

        "text": "[So there they were](https://redd.it/3o5ujo), [two (and a half) idiots](http://imgur.com/X67Krv3) stuck in the underdark, surrounded on all sides by aberrations, rapists, slavers, and those little gnome things with the name that sounds like throwing a bunch of marbles into a blender. It was either this or try travelling across the land in the middle of a freakin' hurricane, and by this point, they were thinking mighty fondly about the hurricane.\n\n[Kai the metal-boned](http://fav.me/d91by1o) [titan wereshark](http://i.imgur.com/qJq1itR.png) was treating this as a learning experience. For instance, he learned that his weapons of choice were utterly useless against gelatinous cubes. Then he learned that the little imp that had been following him around was capable of genocide. And after THAT, he learned about one of those classic random encounters... the rust monster. Did I mention that Kai's bones are made of metal? And that he had a crippling fear of rust? All things considered, Kai was ready to STOP learning things.\n\n[Fisheye the goblin rogue](http://fav.me/d9g1coj) was treating his journey as a harrowing, death-defying fight for survival. He was a little more on-the-nose there. Between nearly being enslaved, nearly being killed, getting driven nearly insane, and making several harrowing escapes from enemies that had good perception scores, he was learning the value of being prepared and having a nice, big selection of alchemical toys. Nothing says MASTER OF STEALTH like throwing flaming snot at your enemy.\n\nThey traveled about two months through the gods-forsaken underdark, and they were pretty fed up with both Aberrations, Fey creatures, and fucking elves (fluffed as fey creatures). So naturally their next obstacle was a combination of the three! Because of plot reasons, they were trying to rescue a dwarf girl from the clutches of a Drider and her personal retinue. How do they accomplish this? By luring her around the corner, trapping her with goo, setting her on fire, and dropping a building on her, and then proceeding to terrorize the rest of the retinue into fleeing. Ah, the ingenuity of low-level play!\n\nAnd with that, they grabbed up the dwarvish prisoner and \"returned her to safety\" by busting down the gates of her hometown and carving a path of political upheaval, violence, and arson through the city streets. But to be fair, it was actually the dwarf girl's idea.\n\nBy that point, the end of their journey was in sight- a tremendous tower leading to the surface! A tremendous tower... in the middle of a turbulent warzone... guarded by drow... and filled with Fey creatures.\n\n&gt; FUCK YOU DM\n\n&gt; FUCK YOUU^UUU^UUU^UUU\n\nAfter a brief stop-off at a goblin encampment (where Fisheye got into a feud with a bugbear-werewolf, and ended it by giving him a three-story atomic wedgie loaded with a massive flaming turd), the party set out towards an active battlefield, where a bunch of underdark assholes were fighting a massive swarm of virulent acid-fungus. That was high on their list of things not to get caught up in, so they devised a cunning plan. They set the battlefield on fire.\n\nThe battlefield choked with flammable spores.\n\nAbout half an hour later, when everyone's ears stopped ringing, they picked over the survivors for EASY LOOT, and continued their journey. And, wanting to get a head start on the whole infiltrating-drow-society thing, they decided to raid a nearby city for supplies and lulz. The plan was simple: Go in, cause chaos, get loot, leave.\n\nBut, as is so often the case with these things, it turned out that the DM was screwing with them. GO FIGURE. While the behavior of most drow was exactly as you'd expect (hedonistic, self-centered rapist assholes), the people that they set out to cause trouble with turned out to be interesting guys. The magistrate, whose mansion they raided, did not have a rape-dungeon or a treasure hoard- he turned out to be a really devoted public servant who was good to his subordinates and obsessed with justice. And then, when they raided a corrupt noble's house, Fisheye took a wrong turn and ended up in the room with [a five-year-old drider girl](http://i.imgur.com/XmPFuMh.png) who roped him into a little tea party. They were feeling a little guilty when they stirred up a civil war and started several fires, then led a massive jailbreak.\n\nOn the way out, they were attacked by an assassin that managed to foul up their escape and disappear before they could nail him down. Oh well, they'll probably never see that guy again! Now, who wants to set up a camp right outside the city? Sleep tight! They rested unsteadily and with extreme paranoia before setting off on the next leg of their journey.\n\nSadly, the way was blocked by MORE WARS. This time, they had the option of crossing a suspicious river, or getting involved in the battle of the murderous midgets. Seeing as they couldn't just blast this battle to tiny bits, they tried the river. But, because they were SMART, they didn't go straight for the shore provided and instead looked for a safe crossing further away. And what they found was a TOLL BRIDGE! One guarded by a TROLL! They had to pay the TROLL TOLL to cross the TROLL TOLL BRIDGE! But Kai managed to bypass bankruptcy by offering to repair and fancify the bridge. Three cheers for being frugal!\n\nBut the delay had unexpected repercussions. As they journeyed onwards, they ran into a drow caravan that had fled the drow city. And you'd better BELIEVE it was filled with characters they'd encountered before. Fisheye slipped into the caravans, and found that one of the caravans was in the process of being raided by some local monsters. He burst in, repelling the monsters and- and found a familiar five-year-old drider girl, who was overjoyed to see her new friend again! D'aw. \n\nKai was having worse luck, though, because he had started a pissing match with a male drider on the caravan, and Kai was quickly spotted due to his rather conspicuous massive sharky appearance. However, when he got the fateful tap on the shoulder, he was confronted not by captain crankypants the drider, but rather by his snobbish sister, who proclaimed that she'd just saved Kai from a spidery fate and now owed her his life. Not wanting to start shit with half a dozen driders at once (in the middle of a town, no less), Kai worked out a deal where he'd basically be the woman's personal servant in exchange for not starting shit. It sounds like a raw deal, but by sheer coincidence, the caravan was heading exactly where the party needed to go!\n\nAnd so the party got roped into being the personal bitches of a group of uptight driders. The things you do when you have to MacGuyer your way to victory. ",

        "text": "Here Comes another story from the maddening adventures of my group that I have lovingly titled “The Gamebreakers” and they have taken that title in stride. The group has grown, Kido the Half-elf Monk, Oni the Tiefling barbarian, Charon the Tiefling Ranger/Rogue(multiclassed), Terra the Elf Druid, and Dave Wobbermenshmanson the Half-Elf Elemental aligned Sorcerer. Along with their ususal npc friends who are mostly Tieflings and a warg. For today’s tale another basic ability broke the hell out of what was supposed to be a party-wipe worthy boss battle.\n\nBackground:\nThis time the premise was a series of Earth elementals invading the material plane. A Dao raiding party has taken over the town and enslaved everyone inside and they need a party of adventurers to save them. After clearing level 1 of the now underground town the invaders were pissed and went after the party in the tent village that they and other adventurers were staying at. There was an intense clusterfuck of combat there with rocks and mental disruption running everywhere. The monk was almost killed by an illusory bone devil, it was a fun time. And the big bad revealed himself with this fight. His name was Goro-Korog, the self-proclaimed god of Elemental Earth. Dave’s response to seeing the big bad was to try his new wand of wonder on him, casting enlarge and making him a size bigger and letting him deal extra damage on top of his truck hits. And after one downed sorcerer and some shenanigans by their adventurer fellows they basically made a cylinder of safety against the earth manipulating of the elementals. Using some crazy metal contraptions they dig their way a few hundred feet underground to the Dao leader’s lair. \n\nEncounter:\nThe Dao leader stood before them, all menacing and whatnot, sealed the massive portal behind him that lead to his home plane and promptly begins monologue. “I am Goro-Korog the god of Elemental Earth” which was promptly interrupted by the sorcerer “I’m Dave Wobbermenshmanson the 17th, nice to meet you.” The seriousness broken the fight began. Lair actions trapping npc’s in the ground, collapsing rocks and spells dealing heavy damage to the party until the barbarian reaches Korog, mocking him about how little he knows how to use his warhammers. Then learned how well he knows how to use him after 47 bludgeoning in 2 hits. (keep in mind it’s a lv 6 encounter). Destruction fills the next 3 turns as the druid turns into a bear and the sorcerer rains scorching rays all over the big bad. Finally the monk gets to point blank and hazards one of his skills. A Con save to prevent being stunned on this monster with +7 con. Big bad wrecks the con save until monk uses the lucky feat to turn his roll into a 2. Now my ace for this fight that was gonna make it into a party wipe was that this dao can cast wish. And when he got to a point where he was about to be KO’ed I would bust it out, but stun slurs speech, so his wish was getting ballsed up. It gave the party enough time to deal a hellish killing blow all together, burning out his eye with acid arrows, scorching his body with rays, mauled by a bear/elf. It was a very ungraceful death. They broke my ace so hard, and they didn’t even actually stop it. \n\nSo that is how the party got to lv7, killed a self-proclaimed god and unlocked the earth elemental evil spell list. Not to mention frustrating the hell out of their dm. But that is what Gamebreakers do.\n\nTL;DR:\nStunning is also Bullshit.\n\n",

I play the alchemist, Fireteeth. We're running around Magic: The Gathering's gothic horror setting, Innistrad. Our mission this week was to kill totally-not-Griselbrand.  \nWe start the session with totally-not-Avacyn carrying us up to the celestial plane to begin our assault on tnG's castle. The drawbridge drops and we find ourselves nose-to-nose with Ghoulcaller Gisa, Stitcher Geralf, and Grimgrin. All of them are promptly tackled by the spirit of a werewolf NPC who died earlier in the campaign, allowing us to enter the castle unopposed.  \nInside, we find an endless staircase and a room full of doors. In a fit of pique, I set fire to the stairs and broke the enchantment one them. Floor 1, bypassed.  \nOn Floor 2, we find another endless staircase. Our sorceress dispels the enchantment, we go up. Then we remember that she knows Dimension Door, and she teleports us up to tnG, only narrowly beating the spell resistance in the area.  \nWe arrive to find tnG and tnA dueling. Fireteeth rolls to attack the boss with a specially-made bomb engraved with a glyph of warding. A critical hit -- 46 damage, plus 27 from the glyph, plus 10 fire from the bomb. 83 damage to the boss, triggers Massive Damage (if hit for over 50 in one shot, Fort. save vs. damage or die). tnG fails the save.  \nFireteeth successfully firebombed the boss to death on the first round of combat. After the initial tidal wave of laughter, we get a slew of rewards and are returned to our native plane of Ravnica, where our final adventure awaits: killing Jace.  \nEdit: I'm bad at math, had to fix 23 to 27.",

Things went swimmingly, except for a rules conversion from 3.5 to 5 and a few paladin nerfs.\n\nThe first dungeon was fairly basic, some rooms, some traps, and a deranged druid. And then they found the Kobolds and Goblins.\n\nI figured that I should add a little optional tunnel of baddies with some slaves mining for the BBEG. However, the Paladin decides to adopt 5 of them. Because this was my first time DM'ing I decide 5 emancipated Goblins/Kobolds = 1 companion. To save space for targeting I ruled that the Goblins/Kobolds acted as a single entity, standing on each other.  And that is how Dobbytron was born.\n\nSome plot happens, Dobbytron is now a 4th level character with 2 lvls in Fighter, 1 in Rogue, and 1 in Warlock. The PCs are lvl 2.\n\nAt this point I realized I needed to get rid of Dobbytron. So I sped up the plot, and introduced the Raven Queen.

        "text": "I lay in bed facing the window, watching as the sunrise imbues the dull, cloudy sky with the hues of summer.  Last night was the first sleep I've had in a bed I can call my own; in a house I can call mine, for a long time.  The past year of my life hasn't been the easiest, most of it I can't account for locked away in hell.  A few months ago I was saved from that captivity, only to find that the rescue took me far out of my home - all the way to Africa.\n\nThe funny thing was, it could have been anywhere.  I barely left Essex up until that point.\n\nNow, we're finally back in the UK.  I can never go back to Essex, but there's not much there I could go back to anyway.  My mother is one of my biggest regrets, not being able to tell her I'm alive, but considering our communication never went beyond a birthday card or call at Christmas, there's a chance she might not even know I'm missing.  That's a little sad really, but for the best.  \n\nAfter all, I'm not in this alone.\n\nDownstairs are my two pack mates, fresh and new since we all lost our old.  Truth be told, my old pack was never found.  I often think on them, but I can't just stay in Africa and wait around for news.  A wolf shouldn't be alone, not with the world as it is out there.  Once we realised we were free, the three of us seemed to click.\n\nSeeing as time is getting on I make up my bed and head downstairs.  Sitting at the kitchen table is Hashard, the first of my two allies, reading through the user manual he received from his new place of work.  He acknowledges me coming down, and I in kind begin to make up a pot full of coffee.\n\nAs it finishes brewing the back door opens, letting a pit bull walk into our kitchen, looking as bored as a pit bull can be.  Greeting him with a smile I close the door behind him, taking a saucer full of coffee and place it on the floor for him.\n\nHashard looks up from his book.  \"Quiet night?\"\n\nStaffy, the pit bull, sits up and speaks, mussel dripping with coffee.  \"Yeah.\"\n\nWe still have a lot to sort out.  Officially we formed our pack a few months ago, finally deciding on a name - 'The Watch' - but not much else.  We've never even spoken about an Alpha, let alone which one of us that would be.  This new territory - Chippingham - has been given to us to protect.  To be fair, we still mesh together well.  This is *nothing* like my old pack, but we all know our strengths and weakness', and we've had time to know each other's too.  As long as it's working, keeping things as a democracy is fine, at least for now.\n\nPlus, despite all the hardship, I'd be lying if I said I didn't already love these bastards.\n\n\"Good to have an easy start.\" I say, moving over to Hashard and handing him a fresh mug of coffee.  He takes the cup, patting my shoulder.\n\n\"You seem in a good mood.\"\n\nBecoming aware of the stupid grin smacked across my face, I laugh.  \"A full night's sleep - first day of work?  Heh, not in Africa?  It's almost like things are -\"\n\n\"Back to normal?\" He finishes.\n\nI nod.  \"A fresh start.\"\n\nHashard chuckles to himself.  \"Thanks for this,\" he gestures to the coffee, \"but I don't think I need it.  I'm going to get some shut eye.\"\n\n\"No work today for you?\"  Our contact landed us all jobs that suited our skills.  Hashard, being a salesman, is learning the ins and outs of the services provided at Archer's Metal Plating Industries, while Staffy and I are starting positions at a local school.  I know - teaching probably isn't the role one expects of a werewolf (especially with our temperaments), but what can I say?  I'm an oddity even by my kind's standards.  Staffy is our head of security, performing care-taker duties on the grounds, while I teach History.\n\n\"Not until I finish this.\"  He gestures to the book he was reading.  Not wanting to see perfectly good coffee go to waste, I take the mug back from Hashard and drink it along side my own.\n\nStaffy takes on his human form, running upstairs to pull on clothes for the day.  We decided to rotate our night time activities - one of us on patrol, one up all night guarding the house, and the lucky third gets to sleep.  I was granted the honour of the first night's rest, which I gladly took.  Considering how much work creating lesson plans, marking homework and going over the syllabus will be on top of my pack duties, it'll be my last one in a good long while.\n\nWhen we're both ready Hashard waves us off as we start walking.  As soon as we get paid, I can start to put my life back together.  Saving up for a car - hell a phone - is top priority.  Staffy and I make idol conversation over the next hour's walk, as I resist the urge to call him by that name or throw any sticks that come across our path.  That was one thing Africa had going for us.  When we were saved we had space to roam, away from people, to be ourselves without worrying about security cameras on every street corner.  It's the trade off for being apart of society in these dark times.\n\nLife is crazily complicated these days.\n\nOnce I leave Staffy at the school gates, the rest of my day goes by as ordinarily as anyone else's.  I meet the faculty, find my way around the school, and begin classes with the guides provided graciously to me by the head of department.  The students so far don't appear too troublesome, something I'm tremendously thankful for, as everything falls so perfectly into place.\n\n'Too perfectly', the voice in my head whispers.  But instead, I'm going to enjoy this.  Before the week is over there'll be some complication, and I want just one - one - day of peace.  To hell with this paranoia.\n\nAfter lunch class resumes, where I find my first power struggle.  More than half the class' eyes are glued to their laps, clearly all on their phones.  After a few warnings, I go around and confiscate the things.\n\n\"But Sir,\" one of the girl's whine, sliding her phone into her bag.  After threats of taking it to the headmaster, she hands it over.  All the students seem to be watching the same video, whatever it is.  I put all the phones in my desk draw, and continue on with the lesson.\n\nSchool ends, letting me once again meet up with Staffy and walk home.  I ask him about his day, and as we approach the house he starts telling me about an incident in one of the other classrooms.\n\n\"I was watching the CCTV cameras right, and six of these bloody kids started surrounding this one lad.  I go to head there when the teacher calls me and the other guys, says stuff's going down: she needs help.  Anyway, I peg it over there right, and the one kid's only got a perfect aikido stance!  He's knocked three of the buggers out already!\"  Staffy goes on to recount the rest of the incident, how the other bully's disperse when he arrives except one, who he had to subdue.  The boy being picked on immediately stops when the threat is removed, and goes with Staffy and the other boys to talk to the Headmaster, where they're all put on suspension. \n\n\"Sounds like your first day wasn't as smooth.\" I comment, heading inside.  We are greeted with clanging sounds coming from the kitchen, as somebody beats the bottoms of our pots and pans.  We ignore what we assume is our guest for the time being (as is best to do) when Hashard emerges from his room, coming down the stairs.\n\n\"Hey, how was your first day?\"  His smile awkwardly disappears.  \"Why was Staffy on the internet?\"\n\nI immediately look at Staffy.  \"Why *are* you on the internet?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, here we go.\"  He rolls his eyes.  \"Some kids filmed what I was just telling you.  The fight at school I had to break up?\"\n\n\"I saw.\"  Hashard bites his lip, thinking on how to word his next sentence.  \"Staffy, did you notice... anything about that boy?\"\n\n\"Other than he was a master of bloody aikido?\" Staffy retorts in his usual crass way.  Sometimes it's hard to remember that a Londonder like him is also a master in many different martial arts himself.  \n\n\"Yes.  He seemed... almost familiar.  I couldn't place it.\"  I look between Staffy and Hashard, having no description to go off of.\n\n\"Where did you find the video?\"  I asked.\n\nHashard points to the kitchen.  \"Ask Sly.\"   Sly One - or Simon as we refer to him outside - appears to be staying with the three of us while we settle.  The morning was so peaceful that I didn't want to draw attention to his disappearance; little of what that man does makes sense to anyone.\n\nStaffy racks his brain for a few minutes.  \"Nothing springs to mind.  Other than that he was - like - sort of a wolf.  Like, a wolf but not a wolf, you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"Wolf blooded?\" Hashard asks translating Staffy's tangled words.  Immediately this sets off alarm bells in my head.\n\nA werewolf can sense a wolf blooded.  A changing breed like Staffy, there's no way he could tell that.  Not unless...\n\nI leave the other two to think and pace into the kitchen.  Sure enough, there is Sly One playing the pots and pans with wooden spoons, a long blonde wig (who knows where the hell he got that thing) attached to his head with a red bandana.  I look him over, thinking of a way to get his attention.  Acting quickly, I knock all the pans away from him, sweeping them all onto the floor.\n\nHe pauses and looks at me.  Thankfully, he isn't in an attacking mood.  Less helpful however, he continues to tap away with the spoons on the table itself.\n\nI sigh.  Why is he the only one with a phone?\n\n\"Sly!\" I yell.\n\n\"Yes?\" He replies in a sing-song voice.\n\n\"I need to borrow your phone.\"  I look him in the eye, in hope that it will stop him drumming away.\n\nAgain, he replies in the same annoying tone.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"I need to see the video you showed Hashard.\"  A year ago I never would have been able to talk to Sly One without completely losing my mind.  Now this madness is just grating.\n\nHe thinks it over.  \"Mm - 'kay.\"\n\nHe pulls his phone from his pocket and perches on the table, tapping away on the screen.  He pushes the phone out in front of me, keeping hold of it, as it plays the video.  Similar to Staffy's earlier description, I see the scenario with the boy being bullied play out, filmed secretly by one of the other students.\n\nI haven't seen the boy in class, so no name immediately springs to mind.  However Hashard is right - he is strikingly familiar.  I stare at him, taking note of his dark red hair and unnerving green eyes.  I've met someone else with those exact traits.  Before we moved into our territory, it was left temporarily in the care of another pack: Akroma's Angels.  The pack was named after their alpha; a fierce woman with little to no sense of humour.  They could have easily been here long enough for her to mother a child, not that I'd expect from her reputation to have been apart of his life.\n\n\"I bet you don't see it either.\"  Sly interrupts my train of thought, poking my face.  I don't bother to flinch or knock his hand away; this only makes his behaviour worse.\n\nI stare at him for a moment, then bring my hand up and pinch the bridge of my nose, shaking my head.\n\nSly gasps.  \"You do see it!\" Immediately he hugs me.  \"You see it - well done.\"  I pat his back awkwardly and he releases me.\n\n\"Thank you Sly - I'm going to let the other's know.\"  I walk back into the living room where Hashard and Staffy are still standing, their attention immediately drawn to me as I enter the room.\n\n\"If I said 'Akroma', does that help you connect the dots?\" I look between Staffy and Hashard.  Simultaneously they react; Hashard groans as his shoulders slump, while Staffy is much more vocal.\n\n\"Fuck - I should have known from the absentee mother thing!  Jesus it all makes sense now.\"\n\nHashard speaks up, \"Do we even know how to contact her?\"\n\n\"I think you're missing the point.\"  I look Hashard in the eye.  \"Staffy can't sense someone if they are just wolf blooded.\"  After a few seconds, Hashard finally realises what Staffy stumbled onto.\n\n\"What?\" Staffy stares at us both, confused.\n\n\"Staffy, that kid is going to go through his first change soon.  He's going to become a werewolf.\" ",

        "text": "So, some of you might remember my new-to-RPG group. To recap: Alcoholic Half-Orc Barbarian, Elf Witch, Oread Druid, and Undine Crossbowslinger. We also have a temp(?) Human Ranger the past few sessions.\n\nSo last session ended with entering the Undine's hometown, a veritable metropolis of pirates, ruled over by the menacing Pirate Queen Tulaye Bya (snicker). Tulaye is a Mermaid, and has a personal beef with Kut'keshi, the Undine. Years ago, when she began her takeover, she killed Kut'keshi's mentor, and Kut'keshi took one final shot at her from an impossible distance and hit her- in the shoulder. Still, she bears the scar with fury and is becoming more and more unhinged with power.\n\nAs the session begins, the party is in a bar, without the Ranger. They go talk to the bartenders, a pair of Human/Half-Orc half-brothers, and ask around about revolutionaries, dissidents, and that sort of thing. The human brother points them towards a small alley nearby. So the party goes there, and finds two guys talking.\n\n\"Hello, fellow dissidents,\" the party greets them, shortly before finding out that the alleypeople are, in fact, head enforcers of the queen. Roll initiative!\n\nAfter a short and brutal 18 seconds of pain and death, the witch had to go (But not before casting Undine's Curse on a poor unconscious asshole, leaving him to suffocate). The rest of the party takes the last two unconscious agents (the only 2 with names) and drag them back to the bar, which now seemed empty except for the workers.\n\nWhat followed was a lot of swearing, threatening, and a coup de grace of one of the unconcious agents to prove the party meant business. Then they found out that the other guy had a magical gunpowder tattoo that activated upon saying the name of a traitor to Tulaye (side note: the Witch specializes in tattoo and tattoo magic.) The thing is, Kut'keshi knows the name of said traitor, but the agent won't budge for anything. So... boom. They set it off, and a sleeping drunk they didn't see before wakes up and runs off to tell the pirates what happened. Also, over the course of the interrogation, the party gave the innkeepers ~160+ gold for a (fake) sob story.\n\nSo the party rushes to the docked ships, joined by the Ranger. There are 3: The Wave Rider, Wave Dragon, and Dragon Rider. One of them is packed with explosives, and the other two are littered with explosive barrels and ropes (that I'm treating as tanglefoot traps). Oh, and there are 12 pirates to fight across 3 boats. I make them roll initiative preemptively so that things don't get bogged down when a fight breaks out.\n\nSo Kut'keshi sneaks around, very slowly, and gets to the 3rd boat, packed with explosives, to untie the traitor and get his help. But he's been out on the ship for a few days awaiting his execution, and is severely dehydrated, so Kut'keshi decides to check belowdeck for water- and walks into the only  enemy pirate on the ship. Kut'keshi gets a surprise round AND has a higher initiative, but it's unlikely he can kill him in two shots before the pirate can call for help-\n\n\"Can I shoot him in the throat so he can't scream?\"\n\nWhy, yes you can. I pull up the rules for called shots and check the penalty for throat shots. Assuming Kut'keshi uses grit to hit, the pirate has an AC of 10 (flat-footed touch ftw), and Kut'keshi has a to-hit bonus of 12, and neck shots are at a -10. So if Kut'keshi rolls an 8 or above, he gets it.\n\nHe rolls... 6.\n\n\"Shit!\" yells the Undine as he fires of a shot wildly, distracting the pirate for a split-second.\n\nFirst round of combat... 9.\n\n\"Fuck!\" The second shot catches the pirate in the throat, silencing him. Kut'keshi quickly takes him down silently, before retrieving water and dragging the traitor back to the dock over a long period of time in the water. Also, he leaves the severed head of one of Tulaye's agents with a bolt sticking out of his forehead on the ship as a message.\n\nThe party starts discussing plans on how to take the ship, and the best plan there is is basically a full-frontal assault, before blowing up the 3rd ship as a distraction. So the Ranger, Barbarian, and Druid walk up to the first ship.\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\n\"Uh... where's a bar?\" asks the Ranger, the only one with a positive Charisma. The bluff check barely passes.\n\n\"I guess that way-\"\n\n\"ATTACK!\" screams the Barbarian, leaping onto the ship and killing the poor halfling pirate outright. The Druid and Ranger both fail their Acrobatics checks, though, since they're in heavier armor, and fall into the water for a while. Then a Sorcerer on the ship gets a Cause Fear off on the Barbarian, ending up with him running to Tulaye's ship while the Ranger and Druid climb up and clean up the first ship. Kut'keshi uses his turn to fire a flaming bolt at the third ship, blowing it up, then leaping onto the Wave Dragon (Tulaye's ship). \"Can I cut a rope and swing up onto the mast?\" DC 20 to make it as a full-round action, 25 to have it be a move action. He rolls a 29, then, from his high vantage point, realizes that the Wave Dragon was the ship he grew up on. His mentor's ship. And soon it will be his again.\n\nThe battle is in full swing, but the Barbarian is surrounded. Things aren't looking good, until the Witch shows up and Glitterdusts everyone. The Barbarian makes his save, along with two other targets, but the Queen doesn't. It's looking like it's going to be close, but the party can definitely come out ahead...\n\nAnd then the ship's cleric kills the Barbarian. Since their Orc Ferocity hasn't kicked in yet, I allow him to say something and then have one non-attack action. His final words are to Tulaye: \"You're next.\" His final action was a bull rush against the cleric to take him down into the bay with him. He succeeded.\n\nThe Druid retaliated quickly, breathing fire over half the ship's crew and blowing up a barrel, before having his bear charge the queen. In short order, the pirates surrendered. Kut'keshi didn't accept the queen's surrender, though. With her tied up, he coup de graced once, though she succeeded the fort save to not die. \"That was for my mentor.\" With a bolt in her head, she spat in his face, and he fired again, dropping her. \"And that was for me.\"",

Jerec in Dark Forces 2 was the first of these, and they appear in Star Wars games a few times afterward, including in KOTOR and the Old Republic MMO.\n\nWhy did we love/hate them? Because our Miralukan player used that description as the beginning and end of his characterization, and even in dialogue, would let us know it.\n\n\"The bounty hunter that tried to assassinate the senator rocketed from that speeder truck to that skyhook anchor as you maintain pursuit-\"\n\nMiralukan: \"I can see using the Force, so I tell the party that he just leapt up to that skyhook anchor in a way I could not normally see, but I saw through the Force.\"\n\nOr later: \"The smuggler scrunches his bristly Bothan face, looking both insulted and let down by the paltry number of credits you have offered him for passage through the blockade.\"\n\nMiralukan: \"I may be blind, but I see through the force that you aren't satisfied with the money we're offering.\"\n\nAnd so on. But it came to a climax where Miralukans were never the same to us, anywhere, again.\n\n\"The Jedi Master tells the party to be patient, to reach deeper, that the answer was always there, if only the mind could be still enough to see through the ripples and the murky waters within.\"\n\nMiralukan: *rolls a natural 20* \"Aw yeah! Sweet. What kind of cool Force vision do I have?\"\n\nGM: \"FINE! YOU... YOU READ THE BRAILLE IN THE AIR-\"\n\nThe group melted down, laughing uncontrollably. The Miralukan, even with his critical success, was now the Braille-reader of the air, forever onward, as were all Miralukans.\n\nThe end.",

        "text": "This story is not one specific event, but it all ties together so bear with me.\n\nMy recent group, the one before Ms. Mensa and the Blue Mage but after M was banished, still had its share of problems, unruly and disruptive behavior, and the like. To some extent I welcomed the joking and the fooling around and the energy behind it, but I also wanted people to at least be chaotic in a general direction and to go easy on the repetitive echo-chamber stuff. For anyone from the pre-internet days that remembers how many D&amp;D groups were disabled for an hour at a time by Monty Python and the Holy Grail recitations, you've definitely been there.\n\nAt my table, I used prop comedy as a form of negative reinforcement. The waaaaaaaambulance was a one-off but it was effective, so I started using other props like that.\n\nOne was the, please forgive the group slang here, the \"furfag wand.\" This was one of those fluffy ceiling dusters with a long handle, that happened to be many rainbow banded colors. Two members of the Triumvirate were furries, but for some reason the name caught on anyway, perhaps because the more unruly players didn't like being the \"furfag\". In short, if someone was being excessively disruptive, we would hand him the wand, and told him that until he waved it so many times silently, none of his actions or words were said in character, and the wand had to be waved until he finished his penance. Some of the players (including the furries) would say \"yiff in hell!\" if the penalized player attempted to act in-game before the sentence was up. \"I move to pick his pocket-\" \"YIFF IN HELL!\"\n\nWe also got a plastic tiara at a local arcade with ticket machines, and we would put that on the head of one of the troublemakers. It feels kind of crude and dated, but at the time, the one wearing the tiara was \"King Shit\". It was awarded for out of character distractions, and a repeat offense got the light up flashing lights to play. Sometimes an especially funny but derailing comment would earn the crown, to laughter, but also earn the lights, with mock-praise. Example:\n\n\"Before you, as the darkness breaks and the somber clouds are torn away, you are surrounded, flooded by glorious light. It does not dazzle your eyes, but somehow, when you gaze upward, you see the disc of light in even greater clarity, and upon its surface, is a watchful face, that in eternal wisdom and serenity, smiles.\"\n\n\"TWO SCOOPS OF RAISINS!\" *crown awarded, light up glitter, mock trumpet sounds after the laughter dies down*\n\nFor years afterward, I couldn't pass a box of Raisin Bran without remembering how King Shit blew my dramatic deity moment.\n\nWe got stickers in the same tiara shape, and for recording purposes, attached them to character sheets. Alas, the most ambitious troll would proudly show new players how many tiara stickers he earned, which showed that negative reinforcement wasn't a cure-all solution.\n\nPositive reinforcement, I found, was far more effective over time. I started having post-game round-the-table bonus experience point assignments, where each player would select another for bonus experience points, giving a reason why, and the DM would do the same. To this day I keep that system up, as long as I have at least 3 players per session. It works better than the props since people want points more than they want to be dicks, I found.",

        "text": "Here are the notes from 7/25. Touched them up a bit.\nApril 9th - We begin ten days of down time for everyone to do whatever we want. Now would be a good time for Christos to go for that bikini wax he has wanted.\n\n\nApril 19th - The ten days are up. We are now off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of peeping on ladies. He really needs to teach me that trick. We start an early morning raid on the wizards shop. Izual knocks on the door and the wizards opens the door and tells us to leave. This would not have happened it we would have worn the girl scout uniforms and sold cookies. No one can say no to girl scout cookies ... hmmmmm girl scout cookies. After a few failed attempts, Izual tries to open the door but it is locked, so Roxy fondles .... I mean tries the door, and it opens. Izual looks foolish, but no one will say so out loud, I mean who would say that to a guy who gets a hard on when ever he sees a dead guy. The battle begins as we meet the wizard, now known as Timmy .... no really. There with Timmy is a masked man who is either a super villain or we just interrupted some really kinky sex act. The Professor does some cook ninja like shit with flipping and rolling into the battle. I could do that to, I just don't wanna. Christos manages to notice that the masked man can see and hear his god. Things are odd. Like a fart in the wind, the masked man and Christos disappears. Once his kinky friend is gone, Timmy gives up. A stranger shows up, a tiefling, and Timmy freaks out like he just got caught watching iCarly with no pants on. Wow, that joke even makes me uncomfortable. Timmy tells us that the masked man was .... dum dum dummmmm .... El Patron. No not the tequila, but that would be interesting. The party begins searching for a letter. They find this letter. It says, \"Dear Penthouse, I never thought this could happen to me ....\" Oops, sorry, wrong letter. \"I have the book you are looking for. Please bring the bounty to the basement of the Alamo. - M\". Roxy knows this to be Marty's hand writing. The stranger, who we now know is named Minerva, does a neat magic trick where Timmy's head as disappeared and his neck is squirting blood like we were in Kill Bill. Also my dreams have been crushed as I learned the head trick was just a giant weasel named Nertle, biting off the head. The party is now heading to some house to snoop around. It is a big house, not as big as Oprah's, but still pretty damn big. They party manages to get past some human guards. Roxy appears to know ALOT about this house, as she takes us through some rooms. She stops in a room that looks very girly. Minerva and Roxy try on dresses and shoes, Izual looks annoyed, I wonder if it is because he can not find anything in his size. As we search some more rooms we come to an office with lots of boring stuff. Or maybe not, as there appears to be a candle holder that looks odd. Someone fondles the candle holder, take that as you will, and we find a secret office ... and office of sin? Nope just some more papers. The stuff in here refers to books, people looking for books. Roxy, Izual, and Minerva all pull a prank on El Patron, who I assume is the owner of the house. Roxy forges documents to have a shipment of pig shit delivered to the house, as well as 300 pizzas, a \"car\", and just for good measures, they have the weasel shit on the pillow. Yep, that is just how we roll. The party leaves the city and tries to contact the airship but gets nothing. Minerva teleports us to the location were they think it is as. They see a smoldering pile of ash. Upon further inspection it is still a smoldering pile of ash. The \"SWAT\" gnomes happen to live to tell the tale of a Cleric burning the ship and killing the rest of the crew. Slappy ain't slappy no more, he is smoky. So as the group gathers the remaining gear that survived the fire, they see Christos' holy symbol, a leg lamp with fishnet stockings. So the cleric burned the ship and now the group has to walk to Texas .... oh wait ... nope I guess not, Minerva can teleport everyone. But sounds like the party is going to need help to get into the U.S. Minerva tells the rest of the party about a coyote who can smuggle them into the country. They teleport to a small town where they will find a tiefling named Zayn. They enter a saloon where they find Zayn drinking. He buys them all a round and hears what they gotta say. They talk about a slave trade, to which Zayn says that Harry will be very interested to know that particular info. Let us all hope that Harry is an actual person and not his pet name for something else. The party also notices that Zayn has some of the clerics gear. He tells them that he found the gear in his regular room and decided to keep it as payment for the mess he left. Zayn gives the gear to the party and keeps only a single item that he wants. Now let us all pause to picture a crazy naked cleric running around the city. You see it? All the nakedness? disturbing huh? Your welcome. They all go to sleep. Minerva has a dream about a man in black telling us to move faster.\n\n\nApril 20th- The party wakes up, and Roxy forges a picture of Jesus on a piece or pita bread. Ooooooo that little rascal. The party teleports out of town to where Zayn picks up his dragon companion Finn. Then we teleport to where we will cross into the border. An outhouse. So, now we gotta crawl through shit. I bet Superman doesn't have to do crap like this. So we go down the shit hole and come up in a barn in San Antonio. We get cleaned up, but dear god that smell will never go away. We find a house across the street from the barn that is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Horsemen. We stay the night there and sleep and swim and search for dirty magazines ... I mean we just sleep and eat. Yeah thats it.\n\n\nApril 21st - We go to the house across the street to get some horses. Along the way we meet a couple of guards. Thankfully they believe Zayn's lie and leave. We begin our travel across the dessert to the Alamo with are new low rider horses.\n\n\nApril 22nd - We get jumped by some Scorpions. We killed them, stole their venom, and ate them. If we come across people we may do the same thing.\n\n\nApril 23rd - Not a damn thing happens. We ride, we eat, we sleep.\n\n\nApril 24th - You know what they say, \" Mo' scorpions mo' problems.\"\n\n\nApril 25th to April 30th - Not a damn thing happens except looks of horse riding. Oh and some pooping, the horses pooped.\n\n\nMay 1st - Coming up to the Alamo at dawn. In my mind we are all wearing shades and walking against the wind. Our guns are cocked, and the doves are flying. Really cool looking John Woo like scene. If only it really happened like that. We opened the door of the Alamo and wandered the area, finding a trap door. Roxy inspects the door and goes on a snooping mission. She comes across Marty, and once we join her, he makes us an offer we can't help but refuse. I was hoping for ice cream with sprinkles and hot chocolate sauce. Oh yeah baby, put on that hot chocolate sauce. Where was I? Oh yeah! So Marty is there behind the desk looking all pale and evil, you know, like vampire tend to do. He says that he is now part of a faction that wants humans and vampires to live together. Now once Izual finds out that Marty is a vampire we all hear a familiar \"tink\". Minerva sends her weasel into the face of Marty and the fight begins. After a very intense battle, the party manages to kill Marty. We find some stuff, thankfully no where among said stuff was a naked person strapped to a table.",

This led them to the keep where they received their mission and it turned out that the head of the keeps soldiers was behind it. The False Big Bad used blood magic to eviscerate the guards who were traitor and used their blood to increase the strength of all of the remaining guards, also turning them into mindless brutes. Each round they would increase in strength and gain 5hp, while losing Dex and Int, culminating in the fourth round.\n\nMy adventurers fought with intelligence, flanking and breaking their formation a bit. But these \"were\" weakling who paid for expensive armor, so it was hard for the group to hit them. Some notes after the blood rage\n\n-The archer started using his crossbow to bludgeon our Cleric and Melee ranger\n\n-A Spearman (rolling a nat 1) ran his spear through one of the guards to attack the Paladin on the other side\n\n-A tower shield guard decided the Paladins tower shield was nicer, so threw his away to remove the paladins; succeeding after two turns.\n\n-Another archer couldn't figure out how to reload his crossbow, so he just threw it at my ranged ranger.\n\nThe last turn on the fourth round comes and it's our Bard. She is not very good at remembering how to play the game, but she has a lot of fun with the roleplaying. She decides to shoot her small crossbow at an enemy, failing her concentration check on her musical buffers. The damage was minimal and she looked very distraught. \n\nMe: \"He turns to look at you, all of his ruptured blood vessels in his eyes causing him to literally cry blood. His jaw clenched, his teeth grinding together so hard you can hear the chipping as his enamels start breaking. His size is too large for his armor as the skin bulges around the plates.\"\n\nI make some fake dice rolls and make painful looks as she gives me the long sad puppy face. Looking her in the eyes as the room goes quiet, I say\n\n\"He screams through his teeth, unable to open his mouth. The veins bulge larger and larger, all of the blood rushes to his face as his entire body goes red. With one final guttural growl, his skin ruptures from the stress as his body literally explodes in the armor. One by one, all of the soldiers suffering from the blood magic burst, sending blood and guts flying in all directions. The paladin, being in front of three, is washed in a tidal wave of crimson liquid.\"\n\nThe room was quiet for a moment while they pondered my news. The bard, while looking shocked; glances at her hand with the cross bow, then shouts \"HEY GUYS LOOKIT WHAT I DID!!!\"\n\nAfter I explain the blood magic used backfiring so unexpectedly, it causes the False Big Bad to throw the captured and bound Lord down so he can hide behind the throne. A few of my players had played this before and knew what was about to happen, my Cleric did not.\n\n\"I go to check on the lord. I want to remove the sack on his head and ask him what happened.\"\n\nThose were the magic words. I usually play some type of bardic or battle music in the background to add ambiance. I immediately switched to some creepy Halloween music, causing her to make the \"uhohwhatsabouttohappentome?\" face.\n\nMe: The lord has a large slit across his throat, dried brown blood stains his neck and robes. But that doesn't seem to stop him from lunging and trying to bite at the first thing he sees. Grapple check!!!\n\nWhile the two were grappling I turn to my Paladin and tell him\n\nMe: \"You are directly behind the Cleric about 40 feet away. In the last 10 seconds the guards in front of you exploded from the Blood Magic, covering you with blood and guts. The Ranger went to help the brother while the Cleric helped the Lord. The Cleric is screaming in fear and is struggling with something, the Ranger is holding back the brother while he stutters NO at the top of his lungs, and the Bard is humming to herself because she thinks her crossbow made all of the guards explode.\n\nPaladin While I put my weapons away I praise my god Heronious on a successful fight, and for him to grant us safe passage as we deliver the royalty to the Kings army. I calmly walk up and try to break up the fight.\" He puts his hands up as if to push two people off.\nMe: your detect evil detects some serious F'n evil. \nPaladin \"DAMNIT Heronious!\"\n\nThe stuttering brother pulls away and tries to hold his brother, who then knocks him down and tries to bite him. The Cleric turned undead at the last second, rolling all the high stats. She is the most emotional one in the group and loves the flavor text. So I say,\n\n\"As the younger brother stutters \"Iii am sssorrry.\" and gives in to the incoming bite; you tearfully place your hand on the zombies back. His skin cracks and disintegrates, a small fleeting smile creeps across his face before he vaporizes into dust, leaving the brother clutching his tattered clothes while sobbing.\"\n\nThe bard takes the brother outside where the Kings army are on standby. The others search for the FBB and notice he has disappeared. The ranger feels around for a trap door and activates the panel she has all of her weight under, causing her to fall headfirst down a dark hole.\n\nIf you read the last chapter of this, you would know that the group bypassed several rooms of guards by using a magic key to reach the final room. The Bard comes running in and she describes it as Quirrel during the Halloween feast \"Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuys!!!!! We has friends...\"\n\nI tell them twenty guards burst through the door, guards who were on standyby to kill you, guards who heard a great commotion and decided to investigate, guards who see their fallen comrades in bloody heaps. They gun straight for you, swords and spears drawn.\n\nThey simultaneously shout \"down the hole!\" and leap in away from the brigade of soldiers and one step closer to the Necromancer...\n\nNew chapter coming soon.",

        "text": "I learned how to play RPG’s in college, from a longtime GM. We hit it off, he was a historical artsy type, with a penchant for acting. He was the director of our little acting troupe, and I, being a freshman, desperately needed people to hang out with. Found this group was pretty awesome and actually liked the same shit I did.\n\nSo he introduced us all to his favorite RPG, Godlike. It’s a superhero game set in the super fatal world of WW2. The powers, called Talents in this system, were super easy to make and with the rules set up, it was remarkably easy to stat and create any type of power within a few minutes. Needless to say, I fell in love with this system and RPG’s.\n\nAfter a series of One-Shots designed to get us familiar with the game, the GM finally decides to run a campaign for us. There’s about 6 of us, ranging from American Combat Medic (More on him in a minute), to Russian Spy Disintegrator, to English Metal Thrower extraordinaire. My Character, however, is still one of my favorites. \n\nHe was a blind sniper.\n\nYes. You read that right.\n\nIn the game, you have Hyper-Stats as a power, boosting your natural abilities to supernatural heights. He had Hyper Coordination, allowing him perfect control of all systems and muscles of his body to precision, and Hyper-Sense, which all of his senses (minus sight) were acute and accurate to stupidly large distances. He could hear the wind around the heads of his enemies, he could track the paths of bullets, and could feel the vibrations of people within a mile just by going Indian-style on the ground. He was fucking awesome.\n\nSo he set the group of us to break the siege of Tobruk. We were given the task of planning this out ourselves, and between the 6 of us, we did a fuck-all job of it. 3 hours later in real time, we were still debating where to bury the rubber dinghy we were going to use on the beachhead.\n\nThis is when I learned the very important lesson of “Don’t bore the GM.”\n\n***“Everyone roll me Hearing, please.”***\n\n*Ohshit.jpeg*\n\nMatt, my sniper, beasts the roll. GM slips me a piece of paper that says ***“5 Planes. Fast Engines, approaching from the south.”***\n\n*Doubleohshit.png*\n\nI tell everyone just as the klaxons go off, and we rush up to the deck. 5 Stuka Dive Bombers were coming in fast. We all start shooting our rifles (what else were we going to do?) and trying to take cover. Two of them take a pass over, dropping their bombs. The Disintegrator proved her worth by just making one of them disappear, but we had no other way to drop them. So Matt rolls Hyper-Coordination to fire. I call my shot on the tail fin, which I can barely see. Get major setbacks, but totally called for. I gotta try anyway.\n\nRoll, and he fucking does it. Matt shoots the tail fin, and fucks it up enough that it makes the bomb veer off it’s path. It barely misses, but the fucking thing isn’t destroying the ship. However, the shrapnel takes out a few of the Corpsmen hanging around. This is when the combat medic decides to show his stuff.\n\n***“I RUSH OVER AND PROVIDE AID!”***\n\nGM: *“Awesome, Roll first aid.”*\n\nThe stupid look on his face gave us all a shudder. ***“That’s a skill?”*** The GM sighs.\n\n*“Okay, roll your Talent for Healing.”* ***“I don’t have that either.”***\n\nMore sighs.\n\n*“What do you have?”* GM had the patience of a saint.\n\n***“I can intimidate him!”***\n\nAfter we all stopped laughing, the GM looked at his sheet. He had no skills in anything relating to medicine. He allowed the guy to change his sheet while the rest of us continued.\n\nCome back to the bombs falling. The other two dive, and we mitigate the damage as much as we can, including a freaking great roll by the metal thrower to toss his knife into the engine of an oncoming plane. It fucked up the run, and the pilot had to bail after petering into the ocean.\n\nFinally, we have the last one. Everyone else has gone, and it’s only me and this plane. It’s got the last bomb, a perfect setup for the bombing run, and nothing could touch it.\n\nExcept for Matt.\n\n***“I shoot the pilot.”***\n\nGM looks at me stunned. *“What?”*\n\n***“I want to shoot the pilot. Matt knows a plane’s setup, and he can sense the wind around it, hear the noise of the engine and propellers. I think he can do it.”***\n\nGm smiles, the epicness of the moment getting to him.\n\n*“Roll your Hyper-Sense to aim, you gotta figure out where he is.”* Bossed it.\n\n*“Okay, now roll hyper-coordination. Minus 5 due to difficulty. You need to make a pair of 10’s to make this shot.”*\n\nIn this system, its D10’s and you have to make matching numbers on them to be successful in your action. I had a pool of 10, the max you can have and he halved it with one word. On top of that, he forced me to roll the highest I could not once, but two times on those 5 dice.\n\n----------\n\nI guess you could say that it was a…\n\n(•_•)\n\n( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■\n\n(⌐■_■)\n\n*Dicey* situation.\n\n[YYYEEEEAAAAAHHH!!!!!](http://mirrors.rit.edu/instantCSI/)\n\n---------------\n\nI roll. The room was totally silent, all my teammates were watching this. If I failed, we got hit. If I failed, we all took damage, which the GM said it was enough that he didn’t feel like calculating it. We all held our breath as the dice fell onto the table.\n\nThe moment of truth.\n\n3.\n\n6.\n\n10.\n\nWe all were on knife’s edge.\n\n9.\n\nLast chance! The dice spun in place, finally revealing it’s face.\n\n10.\n\nWe all launched out of our seats, yelling and cheering. Matt did it! The Gm described the moment beautifully, as Matt waited for the perfect shot, and everything just seemed to line up. The swell of the wave paused, time slowed down as Matt breathed out and released his shot, the bullet traveling between the blades, through the windshield, and into the pilots head.\n\nI was on cloud nine. My team was proud, we had made it. The three surviving planes had already turned around and headed back to base.\n\nExcept for one.\n\nThe one I hit.\n\nWait.\n\nFuck.\n\nIt’s still moving. And now it has no pilot.\n\nAnd it’s heading right for us.\n\nWhat was cheers from my team quickly turned to sarcasm as we realized the plane was heading right for us. We accepted our fate, but at the last moment, the plane veered and crashed into the sea behind us, a blind luck roll behind the GM screen saving the ship, accepting for the radio antennas on the top of the ship.\n\n**Moral of the Story**: Don’t kill the pilot until after he passes you.\n\n**2nd Moral of the Story**: Don’t let your GM get bored.\n",

I thought: \"Well that's fun, I'll make a game about friendship, perhaps even a roleplaying game.\"\n\nSo all said and done, I made a game where they were minions who needed each other's help to get bananas that were out of reach. They had only a limited amount of actions they could take before Donkey Kong would show up and steal the bananas.\n\nIt was descriptive and diceless, and most importantly, short. I only had 50 minutes to get to class, do the entire start of class ritual including prayer and a song before I could run it. It worked. They quickly made characters (basically a name for their minion and something it's good at.) and were able to go through two scenarios.\n\nSadly though, one of the kids somehow didn't know DK and combined with an entire day of halloween crazyness at school he was completely afraid at the end of the session. Because thieves are scary to six year olds. First I thought he was joking, since he is a joker, but it turned out he wasn't.\n\nNext time I'm doing it different I think, eliminating the thief but having them work together to organize a suprise birthday party or something. That still gives a timer that encourages working together.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience, but not for halloween ...",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3rf1n6/ikrpg_how_a_renegade_became_a_paladin/",
        "text": "My party split up after a big campaign, and we decided each character should get their own one-night solo campaign to wrap things up properly. I just ran the first one last night and it was such a hit I decided to post them all here as they happen. I'll get the backstory out of the way as fast as possible. Out of the game you need to know that I homebrewed some classic paladin class up, and I'm not talking about Paladins of Menoth.\n\nRene the Renegade is a Warcaster/Highwayman (think tech/arcane paladin without the moral flair) who has no memory of his past life. He wakes up surrounded by dead bodies, and names himself after the seal on his shield (just says RENEGADES). He joins up with an adventuring company who soon runs into trouble with Ironclad Enlightenment Company (IEC), an army who go around killing monsters and adventurers. They find out that one of the four Paladins from old (Paladin, Freedom, Tyranny, and Slaughter) is heading IEC, and create another army of adventurers to stop him. Along the way, Rene meets many figures from his past life, and discovers he was a virtuous young warrior who headed an adventuring company of his own. He meets an old flame, Esmeralda, a drow who eventually succumbs to the Blight (zombie plague plus hivemind controlled by a dragon). Rene binds her to a horse, and they cart her around until a cure can be found. The party finds the Tesseract, the die used by the gods to create the universe, and uses it to kill Tyranny, and end the rule of the IEC. During this battle, Illisir, a modern paladin (follower of Paladin himself, who is long dead) falls, and his ghost starts following Rene, since Rene is destined to become the next paladin in his place. As well, they learn through the tesseract's time transcendence that all four of them had actually died on the same day as each other half a year ago, and their current manifestations were actually powerful beings from The Coast, a plane halfway between realities, creating convenient avatars with which to alter this world's history (I know, lol so meta). The tesseract is grateful that it is not being controlled by Tyranny, and grants each player a wish. Rene wishes for the means to defeat the Blight Wyrm, which causes a mystical cache of weapons to appear hidden somewhere. The party splits up, and Rene's solo journey begins.\n\nIllisir guided Rene towards the place where the paladins dwell, passing a few places on the way. The first leg of his travels was mostly uneventful; Rene helped out a military outpost in exchange for rations, and swapped tales with some Blighthunters, young adventurers questing to save the land from the rising threat of the Blight. Eventually he came to a small village of only a hundred or so people. They once hosted Illisir, and gladly allow Rene to stay the night. They explain that the Blighted army is approaching from the east, and should be here no later than two weeks from now. They are planning an evacuation, and the nation's army will have a battalion stationed in the village in a week. That night, Rene's sleep is interrupted by quite a commotion. As it turns out, the forerunners for the Blighted are here, and all of the village's battleworthy have already joined the army! The entire town fits into the town hall, and prepares to go through the secret passage. The passage ends up in the woods, and leads to a somewhat distant cave, but if the villagers are not putting extreme effort into covering their tracks, the Blighted will follow them there with certainty. Their only hope is for someone to distract the Blighted just long enough for them to get out of range of detection, but this of course is a suicide mission.\n\nThe idea here is that Rene must choose to give his life defending the villagers, because to say no is to reject the Paladin's way of life, and he will already have failed. I wrote up five waves, only the first of which could reasonably be defeated, of blighted army, for Rene to fight. The idea was that he would be downed but not killed (system all but guarantees this outcome unless it's a TPK to hostiles who want them dead), and after taking out so many blighted, they would simply infect him, in order to gain a new hero for their ranks. This would provide additional motivation for Rene to find a cure ASAP.\n\nHere's what actually happened.\n\n\"Okay, this is a farm town, right? I need all of the pig fat you can possibly spare. Get everyone to break up all of the wooden benches and spread it around as tinder, with piles of pig fat at these key locations. I'm going to draw as many Blighted as possible into the grand hall, then blow it up.\" \n\n\"Rene, you can't,\" says Illisir's ghost, \"you'll be killed!\" \n\n\"No I won't,\" replies Rene, \"My warcaster armour gives me fire immunity.\"\n\nPause gameplay. \"It does?\" I say. \n\n\"Yeah, you told me yourself.\" \n\nTurns out earlier I had given him the Halo of Fire runeplate for his armour, which as advertised, sets anyone who attacks him successfully in melee range on fire, and gives him fire immunity. The villagers are easily willing to part with their grand hall in exchange for their lives, and Rene has a viable plan. In a mere hour, the Blighted were upon the village. Rene sends a couple arrows into their ranks, gets lucky, and drops a couple scouts. He takes his place on the raised platform to the back of the great hall, luckily right next to the escape route, and gets ready.\n\nSome scouts, a couple of [Raek](http://battlecollege.org/file/view/raek.jpg/32363063/raek.jpg), and a captain-type burst in all at once and charge him. The Raek get to him first, and it doesn't take long for one of them to catch fire from his armour. Blighted take bonus damage from fire luckily. He gets some really lucky rolls against the other Raek, and cripples it very quickly, so that it never does land an attack on him. A couple of turns later, the captain is lobbing arrows at him, the scouts are just about on top of him, and the terrain around the burning Raek is starting to catch fire. Rene 1-shots both scouts from attacks of opportunity, replenishing a Feat Point he used to heal up, and the second wave arrives (his goal was to get as many Blighted under one roof as possible, so I made the waves come early instead of one by one, for his benefit). \n\n5 scouts, plus a bigger looking one and a musician, plus 5 more Raek, start charging him. He manages to drop the crippled Raek before the others arrive, and the fire spreads along the wall a bit towards the first pile of pig fat. A few turns of good rolling for Rene and bad rolling for the Raek, and Rene manages to survive several more rounds without dying (not killing a single Raek, though). As the scout battalion comes upon him, one of the hall's walls is broken down by a [Nephilim Soldier](http://a3.res.cloudinary.com/csicdn/image/upload/c_pad,h_300,w_300/v1/Images/Products/Misc%20Art/Hordes/full/PIP73022.jpg), surrounded by a couple dozen Legionnaires and [Hex Hunters](http://jubei.ceyah.org:8081/~jandrese/HexHunters.png). \n\n[Rene figures this is his cue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FjWe31S_0g) [sound and profanity in this link]\n\nRene burns his last feat point to stop the surrounding units from getting an attack of opportunity for his casting a spell, casts Convection on the nearest pile of pig fat, and jumps through the escape route right onto his waiting horse (Esmeralda's horse is there as well, ready to be lead away).\n\nTo explain what was happening around the table, I'd been playing sort of \"on budget\" since we don't have our miniatures and board. So, we used [a Go board and pieces for the units](https://0.s3.envato.com/files/78833222/Image%20Preview.jpg), and red poker chips for fire. To explain the effect of his spell, I just throw a handful of poker chips at the board, pushing a lot of the pieces off. One of them hits another pile (green poker chip), so I throw more red at the board. Basically everyone who isn't immune to fire or a Nephilim Soldier dies more or less right away.\n\nAs Rene is riding off into the night, opposite the direction that the villagers went in, an [Angelius](http://handcannononline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/angelius.png) follows him, moving much faster. Rene makes good distance, but eventually the wyrm catches up to him, and opens with fire breath.\n\nYou can easily imagine the effect this had on Rene.\n\nEasily, because that effect is nothing at all.\n\nRene gets an amazing crit off, and cuts the Angelius' largest wing along the middle with a Horseman's Axe. It lands harshly, coils up, and strikes Rene with its tail. Let's just say these things aren't built to attack mainly with their tails. It lights on fire and panics, giving Rene an opportunity to strike again, perfectly cutting the other wing, rendering it almost entirely immobile. In rage, it shoots fire with futility, and tries to eat Rene whole, but Rene is too fast, and cuts its head off with one final blow!\n\nYeah, the bastard was immune to the big boss' guns, and then 3-shot it.\n\nSo, our hero not only survives the onslaught of the largest army he's ever fought, he takes half of them down, and escapes without their mark. I'm not even disappointed that I didn't get to blight him.\n\nHe makes it to the paladins' Citadel much earlier than expected, and is greeted by two paladins, the elderly Plato, and the middle-aged Anthony, as well as a young orcish woman in full plate named Mei. They talk about how the Citadel only exists in their god's heart and not on the planet, how only a few paladins are ever in the Citadel at a time, and how Mei has been a squire of the paladins almost her entire life, which should seem to give her preference for becoming the next paladin, but tradition dictates it should be the squire of the last paladin to die, even if he'd been a squire for a week. So, Plato decides to give Rene not just one final test as would be traditional, but two tests, one of which will be in competition with Mei.\n\nThe first test is that Rene must Smite Esmeralda, his blighted ex-girlfriend who he's been carting around, looking to cure. Plato gives a long speech about how it is painful for paladins to fight, and that smiting evil is stressful, as sometimes it doesn't do extra damage, which tells you that you're killing innocents by mistake. However, Blighted are always evil, and his Smites will always connect against them.\n\nRene nods his understanding, and makes for the door, unwilling to kill Esmeralda. Obviously this is the correct answer to the test, and Plato is happy to welcome him into the order. He invites the other three into his study, to discuss the final task (Anthony is there just to decide who wins, apparently). \n\nPlato explains that he has been studying the magic of paladins his whole life, and has found a way to use the Citadel's inconsistencies to travel in time. Without warning, he thrusts everyone to some frozen wasteland in god knows what year, and screams at them to defend him while he meditates.\n\n\"Followers of Paladin!\" screams a voice like rusty nails. \"You die!\"\n\nSlaughter himself is standing behind Rene, and attacks. They hold out a few rounds, as Plato said, with Mei casting supportive defence spells, and Anthony and Rene taking turns doing zero damage while taking boatloads, then moving back and receiving Lay on Hands. With Anthony crippled in two areas and almost out of Lay on Hands, it seems that Plato finally finishes his task. An insanely large hole opens in the sky, with searing runs emblazoned onto some invisible wall around it.\n\nA Tarrasque claws its way out, and the hole closes behind it. Plato instantly Falls, losing all his paladin powers, and gets eaten for good measure. Seeing a much more interesting fight, Slaughter abandons fighting the adventurers, and starts clawing away at the Tarrasque, seeming to do no damage that isn't regenerated, but dodging all that the Tarrasque tries to do.\n\nTime travel stuff takes hold, and suddenly they're all in an orcish village, where a band of adventurers is conducting a raid. Anthony immediately recognizes his younger self and old adventuring party, and gets Rene and Mei to hide with him while it all plays out. He realizes that Plato's spell must've been focused on significant days for each person (the first day Plato can finally lock Slaughter in unending combat with the Tarrasque, the day Anthony and Mei met). They watch in tears as Anthony explains that meeting a defenceless orc girl crying over her parents' corpses is what made him become a paladin, and he was officially inducted when he took Mei to the Citadel, where he refused Plato's demand to find her a home among other evil orcs where she belongs, so that she can be killed by adventurers when it is her time (Plato is not the smartest tester). Anthony decides not to try to alter time here, since the paladin life has been so fulfilling for him.\n\nThey flash again, and wind up on the road where Rene awoke almost a year before, with no memories. They hide again, and watch as Rene and his friends are killed by the IEC. Anthony is unable to watch Rene die, so he casts Lay on Hands one more time to stop his bleeding out, before Rene can explain this mistake. Rene suddenly ceases to be, due to past-timeline Rene never dying in the first place, and a new timeline is created.\n\nRene awakens to two humanoid figures fading to somewhere else, looking confused. He has deja vu, and worries he's lost his memories, but find that he has not. We go through a brief summary of the campaign again, with slightly different actions from Rene. The party never goes into the tesseract this time, but Rene still meets Esmeralda and Illisir the paladin. New timeline Rene makes his way to the Citadel, just like before, and is greeted by Anthony and Mei, only now they call themselves Plato and Mary.\n\n\"Plato\" (name taken on by all leaders of the paladins) tells Rene that he has already passed every test he could be imagined to pass, and dubs him Sir Rephael, which is celestial for \"Healed by God.\"\n\nAnd so, Rene the Renegade alters history once again, to trap the most evil being in the world in unending combat, regain his past memories while losing more recent ones, and eventually becoming the next paladin.",

A dank and smelly place.  Misdir the ranger is being treated by the barber for filth fever.  He quickly realizes that he must get out of there before they bleed him to death.  Making his way to the local temple, me is treated and healed by Daran, who in turn gets in trouble.  \n\nThe paladin enters our story at this point and helps Misdir deal with some local thugs who are trying to burn a fire Genasi.  Misdir notices the ranger and the three kill the thugs, the last one dying as he runs away.\n\nMeanwhile, Herb, the druid is selling some weeds to the local priest, and the deal goes south.  He doesn't get paid and leaves unhappy.  On the way out, Daran does purchase a few quarters though.\n\nAs night approaches, the party splits and some head to the woods, while the rest go to the Five Dragons Inn &amp; Tavern.  The guys out in the forest notice 'The Herald', a famous bard.  Excited for his stories, they head back into town, and Daran, not wanting to miss things, sneaks out of the temple and the five meet up in the tavern.\n\nThe Herald's first story paints the Dark Knights in a bad light and a brawl erupts.  The five band together and take down six thugs, making friends with The Herald in the process.  As the bard becomes more coherent, his eyes widened and he exclaimed to the party, \"It was my dream of you that has led me here.  The Sylvan Key that is meant for you has fallen into the hands of the enemy!\"\n\nTalking about the key, The Herald reveals that the key is not a key and that it has fallen into the hands of Pegrin, a self labeled 'Dark Knight'.  He explains that they key is an elven object once kept in the Palace of Arathene, an elven city to the east.  The Herald emphasizes that this is an important object and is meant for the group, although he cannot foresee what it is meant to do.\n\nThe party ends the evening with beer and fey weed (also Ash struck out hard).  \n\nThe following morning, with no preparation the party headed directly for Pegrin's camp.  A surprise attack downs two of the guards, but a third thug raises the alarm.  The fight starts well, the mage is killed without even unleashing a spell, and the guards fall to arrows.  The tide is quickly changed as the paladin loses his right hand and falls unconscious, followed by the cleric and a ranger.\n\n\nAsh starts a forest fire as he runs and continues to pump arrows into the enemy.  The dead and dying use an action point and are stabilized.  The tides turn again as a nat 20 is rolled and Misdir stands again.

You see, when M became DM and made a group decide that was a very bad idea, I was asked back, but I was still feeling hurt, considering that they were laughing along, previously, with all the \"he takes pills! WHAT A LOSER!\" parasitic popularity stunts that M pulled to drive me out of the group to begin with.\n\nSo, in the session before I decided to take up the mantle of DM again, our substitute was Biggy.\n\nBiggy was HUGE. If you remember that Blade movie where the really fat vampire is being tortured with a flashlight, we used to directly compare him to that. He wasn't inherently a bad person, and was actually a lot of fun in D&amp;D... as a player. He usually played a half-ogre with a fondness for misunderstood fashion, like tiaras, pantaloons, and smoking jackets, often worn in some nightmarish combination.\n\nBut as a DM? Hoooooh boy.\n\nHe said he had experience, and we believed him. Maybe he did, but it was very bad experience.\n\nHe starts in the way that dickish DMs (and dickish adventuring modules, so I hear. I never use them) usually start a campaign: naked. Yep, no gear. Anything we selected, gone. He said that a mad wizard captured us, a mad wizard made us wake up naked in these little glass booths that we had to break ourselves out of, and that the same mad wizard put us in a dungeon. Because mad wizard. Because madness = lolrandom, but I digress.\n\nThere were items in the room, besides us as naked people. But behind each glass panel, there were some oddly specific yet inappropriate-for-our-use items, as if drawn strictly from a large custom-made dungeon loot RNG. I'm talking a fishing pole, a sack(empty), pieces of charcoal, and I think a bec de corbin polearm (2nd Edition had WAY too many stupid polearms, almost none of which were were picking up training in, due to almost never finding magic versions due to diversity glut and for many of them having poor damage dice).\n\nHe then described the next room as having a single goblin in it, a wall of fire behind him, and a few coins on the floor.\n\nHeeeeey, wait a minute, I said, and wanted to see something.\n\nI never did this before or since, but I insisted on looking past the DM screen: on dot-matrix printout, he had a stack of weird maps, marked with a long legend of weird features, like monsters, items, and spell effects.\n\nI learned he made the dungeon, beyond the first room with all the glass barriers, ENTIRELY with a computer program. He insisted it worked brilliantly in Diablo, which only came out a short time before then. I grabbed the maps he printed, and looked at them. They were so random that it was basically utterly stupid even exploring them. One floor had the next floor's stairs next to it, and yet another had a huge pile of treasure with a monster sitting at a dead end. Stuff like that.\n\nBiggy shouted at me, with a rather ear-ringing sharp voice. \"You broke the DM barrier! Lightning kills you from the heavens?\"\n\n\"No, roll randomly to see what kills him. Maybe charcoal and a bec de corbin.\" said one of the players.\n\nThat day I learned the limitations of procedurally-generated gameplay, early on.\n\nI was DM next session. Biggy went back to being a fun player instead of an awful DM.",

I own a copy of a tarot deck marked with all the game's faces, with the rules printed with the box. It's worn but well-loved now. With some in-mythology excuses, the temptations of the deck generally appeared once per campaign.\n\nI had a min-maxing powergaming player who wasn't quite as horrible as M. Yes, abused 3.5 rules badly, template stacked to a ridiculous degree, and so on, but at least he wasn't M.\n\nBut he was a whiner. He was such a whiner, that I prepared for that night's game by buying a large toy ambulance that had light up emergency lights and siren sounds, and had it hidden away before the game. I knew he'd be upset with something, and I was prepared. With an extra-large waaaaambulance.\n\nWell, he spent the entire first half of the session making his new character, after committing suicide at the end of last session. Yep, he was one of those guys. Things didn't go his way? Template wasn't as invincible as he hoped? Suicide. At least it kept his levels behind the party to reduce his min-max profile (I did say \"NO\" a lot to a lot of his more ridiculous ideas, but having him start 2 levels behind lowest living party member was a decent house rule for each reset).\n\nAt the mid-way point, the party had a Deck of Many Things, and took it to the local tavern to show it off and fool around with it. Riches rained from the sky for one, another found a friend barging through the door decreeing lasting allegiance, and still another caught some -1 to all saving throws. You know, the usual.\n\nBut then the min-maxer said \"done\" and slapped the sheet on the table.\n\nI described what was happening and where we were.\n\nHe described his new character ambitiously, if ridiculously. He didn't play \"me with better stats and beefier build\" but he did love tattoos, piercings, topknots and other eye-clutter that was very common in 3rd Edition art. He was like living dungeonpunk and made it especially silly.\n\n\"I say nothing, push through the crowd watching, and draw a card.\"\n\nThat was his first action. He described himself, then pushed through the crowd, and drew a card.\n\nVoid.\n\nHe sat back, was about to speak, looking rather defeated and about to complain, but I raised a hand to say \"one moment\" silently and hurried out with his prize.\n\nThe waaaaaambulence sounded, and rolled on the table.\n\nHubris and schadenfreude intensified. Laughter all around... and then he took the ambulence, and put his knees over the roof, and being a skinny guy, he RODE IT OUT OF THE ROOM.\n\nIt's nice to remember non-M moments. :)",

        "text": "This story, like all of them, is before the \"final banishment\" story. This one goes way back, to high school years. It's not about tabletop RPGs, but rather a (very good) computer game called Wing Commander: Privateer. If you are an old timer or don't mind pixelated bit-mapped space travel, it's worth a play.\n\nAnyway, this story was about a very specific thing he did, I saw him doing when I saw him play the game on his computer, and that he bragged about to others in high school.\n\nYou see, in Privateer, there was a \"standing\" system. Factions in the game, ranging from the Confederation to the Militia allied with them, to Merchants and Bounty Hunters, to Pirates, Retros, and of course, the Kilrathi, could be friendly, neutral, or hostile to you based upon your actions in the game.\n\nTypically, blowing up a faction's enemies endeared you to that faction, while the faction of the blown up ship hated you more. Blowing up lots of merchant vessels would get the Militia and Confed on your case, and eventually, Bounty Hunters. Blowing up Confed vessels, if you were particularly dickish, would eventually warm the Kilrathi up to you. And so on. At one point in the game's story, you're forced to side with the pirates and the Militia, Confed, and eventually, Bounty Hunters all gun for you.\n\nI learned something back then that was a little meta-gamey and was cheap, but was better than being shot at across civilized space. If you used your comm channel and spammed the \"nice\" message choice to most factions (usually chat choice 3), gradually, the attacker would stop attacking. It took a lot of messages, so it was best to tap the comm hotkeys, select the ship and message them as a series of rapid keyboard strokes. If you got good at this, you could make an entire squadron leave you alone and say nice things to you. Kind of lame, isn't it?\n\nWell, I also learned that making angry ships happy, then landing, gradually increased the invisible faction stat. So, for the main story, I could become unbothered by law enforcement ships by doing this enough. Yes, scripted encounters in the main story still had them as hostile, but it was quite a trick that I used to wipe off the stain of \"oh you smuggled contraband once for the plot? Die pirate scum!\"\n\nM was taught this trick, sulking before about how the game punished him for completing the story (which I admittedly agreed with) until then. But it wasn't long before I learned how he became the Neckbeard Pirate King of Space.\n\nThis is how thorough his craving of consequence-free winning was. He would, for HOURS in that game, roam around, looking for encounters between Kilrathi or pirates, where they would be in the same place as merchants, militia, Confed, or bounty hunters. He would use my comm-spamm trick on the \"bad\" guys, and use them to attack and destroy the \"good\" guys, often with carefully-placed shots to weaken the \"allied\" ships so they would go down.\n\nThen, he would collect cargo. Not just any cargo from the wreckage. He would delibertately only collect ejection pods from ships that had female characters responding. And only ones to his liking. Then he would ram into the other escape pods, sometimes laughing and the spinning severed head and severed arm bitmaps that you could see if you slowed down enough to watch after impact.\n\nHe would do this, for HOURS, looking for the perfect \"spare chicks in his trunk\" as he put it. He told me, he bragged about it, like it was an accomplishment. If a ship had more than one escape pod, he would kill them all, because that would risk him having a male slave in his trunk (yes, captured pilots become marked as \"slaves\" after you land, and can be sold)\n\nHis Centurion-class warship had room for 20 \"hidden\" slaves in the story-aquired extra storage that was immune to scans. He wanted another 50 in his regular storage, though, so when contraband scans detected the slaves, he would do the comm-spam trick. And then, the police would smile and wave as he carried his collection of slave girls in his trunk.\n\nI'm feeling a tightness in my chest just remembering all this. He was a monster in the making.\n",

(his anti magic aura, passed over her, but fixer didn't realize this was the reason)\n\nThe Big spider screeched, its friend screeched, and hundreds of spiders came screaming out of the trees.. Cat sized, dog sized, mostly normal skull sized. \n\nLucky, remembering that her knees were bare, and these f'ers were venomous, she dropped to her knees and fought at the spiders height.. she slaughtered all the bigger ones as the smaller ones fled..\n\nGlasses, now out of the trance, started throwing crystal daggers, deep penetrating blades, but the spiders were wearing their old discarded carapaces as armour over their new carapaces.. Doubled layered plate! Luckily, one managed to puncture this hide and stab the beast, and being a spider, the tiniest damage is usually enough to incapacitate it, the second one killed it.\n\nThe second giant spider leaped down from the tree and punctured fixer, pumping him full of venom, and now cast a web of energy at the fixer, but being anti-magical, nothing happened. \n\nSwinging her heavy chain with all her might, Glasses slammed it into the spider, over and over, battering the thing into unconsciousness, it would wake, and pass out, wake and pass out.. then, while it was out, glasses and mask tied up the beast, and dispatched the last few stragglers.\n\nSafe, (for now) they crated out the last living spiders, threw the dead into the giant fishing net they brough, tied the whole thing to the crates on the hand cart..\n\n.. then they all felt the strange effect, the spider had awoken in the crate and started using its effects upon them again.. glasses remembered that kissing fixer would fix things.. so she did.. and commanded the rest to follow suit. so they left this necromancy cursed place with haste..and then almost walked off the planet!!!\n\nLow and behold.. a whole swathe of forest was destroyed.. the trees burnt to black stumps and gutted hulks, the ground blacked and bloodied with no visible bodies, villages in the distance burned, it was terrible.. a long grey, dying man, crawling, spotted the heroes and asked for help, but the group were too 'scared' to cross this threshold, lest they not return.. \n\nGlasses rolled the old man the jar of healing cream (they sniggered as it rolled, couldn't help themselves) and lucky bravely walked across to him and applied it to his wounds.. the rest stared on, too scared to trust this apparition..\n\n\n\nThey conversed with this man, he explained that everything was gone, where did they come from? -middlehelm they replied, - did it survive the attacks? - yes, but the poor in the north were killed.. - who were they? - heroes..\n\nAnd with that, the vision / illusion  disappeared.. replaced with reality.. the forest.. what was this..",

        "text": "As promised, even though I wrote the chronological conclusion of the Endless Sexual Conquests and Self-Made Man Manly Victories of M, there are plenty of stories left to share. Here is one.\n\nThis one takes place in a Shadowrun group that predates \"The Wifefuckers\". Yes, he was involved here, too. Unfortunately.\n\nM had this thing he called \"street patrol\" that he expected, constantly. You see, when I was out of ideas during extended marathon sessions of Shadowrun (and my brain was contaminated with the byproducts contained within my portion of the pyramid of 29 cent McDonald's hamburgers the group stocked up on, 2 car trips at a time), I made a table with sub-tables, each roll of a 6 sided die being assigned a portion of what happened. So, one roll might say \"alley\". Next roll might say \"local gang\". Next roll might be \"robbery\", and last rolls would be overall racial composition and how many. I did this if I wanted to keep the group busy but was out of ideas.\n\nHowever, due in part to M's at-the-time notoriously obsessive grind in Fallout 2, where all he did for MONTHS of playtime was drive to this cave with high-exp aliens in it, kill them with a minigun, and then when out of ammo, drive away and buy more ammo. Over and over and over, until he had a beardishly high level and just about every perk in the game. This is important because I think that's how he saw Shadowrun, when he wasn't having sex with female NPCs and demanding sex because of his didn't-actually-roll-the-die-but-thumped-it-down-with-his-palm-over-it critical successes said time for sex. When he wasn't having sex, he wanted Street Patrol.\n\nThis got especially bothersome when I had a story arc and a world-hopping campaign in mind, with all the fun troupes, like a missing heir to a hidden private fortune, a megalomaniac CEO with a personal grudge against the party, a plucky ragtag band of guerillas that had the party's back, and so on.\n\n\"This is gay. Can we street patrol again?\" Said, interrupting many dialogue scenes. Investigating a clue? Gay. Street patrol. NPC shadowrunner that's been scouting ahead of the party and is telling them the best way to infiltrate a research compound? Gay. Street patrol.\n\nI didn't always give him his street patrols, but when I did, they were roughly as engaging and interesting as procedurally-generated terrain on a vanishingly-small-scale Minecraft clone.\n\nIf M wasn't trying to put a dick in it, he didn't care for story, setting, anything. Bullets or sperm, those were the options.\n\nThis came to a climax (before I effectively banned myself from ever \"street patrolling\" for the party ever again no matter how much he begged) during a climactic boss fight.\n\nAll the goodies, all the fixings. Super-chromed min-maxed killing machine cyberzombie, crashed t-bird that ploughed through a condemned building, fire spreading through flimsy dried tenements, while the team was in fighting retreat away from Shadowrun's take on the Terminator.\n\n\"This is a fucking cliche. Just street patrol it.\" M said, with a long sigh.\n\n\"Were you even paying attention to the last few hours?\"\n\n\"I'm a GROWN-ASS MAN and I've had some wine. I don't pay attention to stupid shit.\"\n\nThat was especially weird because he did react and respond to events before, including the events leading to the t-bird crashing and the cyberzombie's kill-the-party-as-a-goal rampage. It's as if even my campaign story was, all of it, \"street patrol\" to him. None of it connected. It was moment by moment just wet holes to stick his dick in, mooks to stick bullets in, or me unfairly putting irritating nuanced obstacles in front of him, which is gay.\n\n\"No more street patrols,\" I said.\n\n\"You have no fucking imagination,\" muttered M.",

        "text": "Again, as a warning, this story is a collection of memories of me and those that were there when it happened. M's worst moments weren't necessarily during this night of his final banishment, but the group was certainly sick of him by this point, were less receptive to his \"free\" food and drink that took on the burden of howling obligation and coercive demands, like a devil's bargain where the devil is a tactless, belly-slapping, bellowing neckbeard and not very good at making contracts. Imagine if the devil gave you a gumball as a kid, then on your deathbed, he shows up and bellows \"WHERE'S THE SOUL YOU OWE ME! WHAT THE FUCK! I PAID FOR YOUR FUCKING GUMBALL!\"\n\nWell, on with the story. I may share more M stories, but as far as RPGs go, this is the chronologically last one involving M.\n\nThis was the same campaign, with the Firesong, the fancy flying mechanical dragon that could breathe fire, latch its claws onto enemy airships to send in boarding parties, and so on.\n\nSomehow M managed to whine, scream, have his wife send me guilt-tripping emails, and so on, until he finally got back in. He behaved, sort of, even if he was muttery and mumbly, excusing it of course as \"I'm a grown-ass man and my wine is more entertaining than this\", which was weird considering what his wife told me he was doing when we kicked him out. Maybe he was bored because I, and those around me, were all pretty close to done with his brand of neckbeardery.\n\nSo, the ship, which you might recall before, was planned to be upgraded to be the scourge of the seven skies, and questing was well underway to retrieve the parts and materials needed to make this happen.\n\nOn the final night M was involved, upgrading was just about complete, all the parts and materials accounted for, a confederacy of bickering, arguing, but fantastically talented engineers from across the many warring city-states and provinces all gathered for the single purpose of re-forging the airship into something of legend-\"\n\n\"Is this some PC shit?\" he slammed his wine glass down, like a passive-aggressive Thor that decided that wine was more enlightened than what was usually in his flagon. \"Teamwork?\"\n\nSilence around the table, but not a meek silence, but a tired, irritated silence. I spoke up. \"It's the most advanced and sophisticated airship ever built, and it's about to be UPGRADED beyond that.\"\n\n\"Fuck that shit. If you actually knew your history, everything that was worth a fuck was done by one man.\" Tolstoy wrote giant books criticizing that idea. Did Napoleon singlehandedly fight every soldier? Did the Egyptian monarchs push stones up ramps to make their pyramids? Eh, I better not make a political point before some Randroids \"ackshually\" me in the comments.\n\nSo, I glared at him. \"Fine. You want to dismiss all the engineers that the party gathered-\"\n\n\"They shouldn't even be there. Instead, have them bicker about their stupid political shit. M has no nation. M speaks for no one but himself.\"\n\n\"No shit\", one of the Tribunal players said (for reference, my most solid and loyal three players).\n\nHe slammed a fist down, sucking in his lips in a way that made his lips disappear entirely, eyes bulging as he stood up as if expecting us to reel back. We didn't.\n\n\"I WROTE A FUCKING APOLOGY! YOU ARE ALL FUCKED IN THE HEAD! WHAT KIND OF SHIT WAS (AngryDM) SAYING ABOUT ME?!\"\n\nI remember replying, with acidic dryness, \"I said nothing you're not doing, right now.\"\n\n\"So sick of this shit...\" he swung his head low. \"I'm trying to open your FUCKING MINDS.\"\n\n\"To what? That one man can upgrade the Firesong?\" I asked.\n\n\"I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A UNBURDENED MAN CAN DO.\" and he rolled.\n\nThat day, the man that ran real life was a troll.\n\n\"TWENTYYYYYYYYYY!\" he did this caveman-like triumphant crotch-out arm pumping. Yes, I know that natural 20s should have limitations, otherwise a player saying \"I want to try jumping so high I reach the moon\" could successfully jump so high he could reach the moon, one time out of twenty. But because of the heat of the moment, and because I unwittingly walked into this, he got his natural twenty.\n\nM was the Randian superman who needed no help and bootstrapped his way into upgrading the Firesong, singlehandedly. Nevermind that every step of the way he demanded and expected special favors out of character because he threw money at me and the group, and in-character the party was sort of the \"roadies\" for his one-man band, cleaning up after him and setting the stage for his public masturbation sessions.\n\nI had enough, and I decided to utilize a bit of lore about the Firesong that the party was aware of, yet he was likely too uncaring, wine-drunk, or otherwise petulent to pay attention to.\n\nOne of the upgrades the party agreed upon was that the ship would gain self-awareness. Since M declared he was doing work of the greatest minds of the many nations of my campaign setting, why would any of the upgrades be excluded?\n\nSo, during the finale, I planned for the SHIP to be the final boss. What better, theatrical act of hubris for a bunch of sky pirates would there be than that? They didn't fully expect it, but they were grins and smiles, OOCly wondering what would eventually take them down. They got bolder, brasher, but as players, they knew they were preparing for a fall.\n\nNot M.\n\nAnd so the Firesong awoke, and immediately revolted, devastating everything around it with its many weapons systems, withering blasts of amplified elemental fire, sonic-attuned vibroclaws, and much much more.\n\nThe party was surprised, but grinning. They made their own boss battle.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK! THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!\" Bellowed M.\n\n\"The Firesong is successfully upgraded.\" I said with a coy expression. \"All intended systems online and operational.\"\n\n\"THIS IS A FUCKING GRUDGE AGAINST ME. ADMIT IT, YOU LITTLE BITCH.\"\n\nI looked at the rest of the party, and they shook their heads as I did.\n\n\"I WOULD NEVER DESIGN THE FUCKING SHIP TO TURN ON ME!\"\n\nSo sayeth, things like that, every egotistical, hubris-prone narcissistic asshole in fiction, and real life, for that matter. I am as constant as the northern star! stab stab stab\n\n\"You wanted to do the work of every single person gathered to make the ship. So, you did all their work. Including making the machine self-aware.\"\n\n\"WHY THE FUCK IS IT AGAINST ME?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't it be? You have used it, abused it...\"\n\n\"I MADE IT WHAT IT IS! I GAVE IT EVERYTHING.\"\n\nThere is a message here, and I hope you all find it.\n\n\"... and it's had enough.\" What I meant to say was that it had lingering background memories of all the pain it suffered, all the wounds inflicted when it was blindly obedient, only intelligent enough to report and record damage. It would have turned on the entire party, but there M was, shouting like every asshole in fiction and not-fiction alike, that his vision of greatness, now and forever, can not be toppled, or else he will whine to the DM until he changes it.\n\nI decided to give in, but in the most disgustingly guilt-delivering way possible. \"Fine. Instead of everything I just said, it is confused, unhappy, and wishes to know why it was created in the first place-\"\n\nHe cut me off once more. \"You fucking ruined my Firesong.\"\n\n\"Ruined it? Things having a mind of their own are ruined? Because they don't slavishly obey you?\"\n\n\"YOU KNOW WHAT I FUCKING MEANT. FUCKING BITCHES. FUCK YOU!\" he didn't stomp away, he dragged away, sulking. He had the glisten of tears on his face. I swear this to you.\n\nThe group looked at each other, and I looked at them. Nods.\n\nThat's all it took. We never returned there to play an RPG again.",

Wright flew overhead, scouting for any approaching enemies, and Mialee kept pace beside the Caravan in tiger form.\n\nShe was a Were-Tiger, remember? 3.5 allowed Natural Lyncanmorphs to be taken at a +3 Level adjustment, and they could control their shifting and not have any of the pesky side effects like moon madness or loosing control of their characters. Fun stuff.\n\nAnyway, Tiger-lady is running beside the Caravan, when Wright spots movement with a passed perception check (plus a bonus for eagle vision and height bonus). He spots a group of riders on horseback, about five, with no identifiable markings to affiliate them with the Kingdom.\n\nBandits.\n\nSo Wright flies down, informs Alcatraz and Mialee, and the three of them peel off from the Caravan to intercept the incoming group. With intentions to Subdue, Main, and Burn in equal measure.\n\nThe Bandits, meanwhile, have failed all their checks to notice their imminent death, and are caught completely off-guard when a bolt of eldritch fire streaks out and lifts one of them from his saddle, killing him as impact with the ground breaks his neck.\n\nAnother then proceeds to fail his ride check, and has his horse throw him off, to be trampled underfoot as the remaining three bandits scatter, trying to make themselves harder to hit.\n\nThis is useless, as Wright slams down on one from above, shoving him off, then grabbing the reins of the horse and pulling it to a stop. Another is toppled as Mialee jumps up, ripping through his upper body, and leaving a frightened horse to gallop off in terror.\n\nAnd the final guy? Well, he found his top half separated from his bottom half. And then his top half was on fire, as his bottom half continued forward, still mounted on a horse.\n\nNow, at this time, aspiring DM's, you will find yourself with a conundrum: the players have captured an enemy. Conventional logic dictates that they will question him, try to get information. This involves a whole slew of decisions on your part: what do you allow as forms of getting information, what do you count as torture. If they torture the captive, what goes to far, makes it dangerous to their alignment. Do you tie in the overarching plot, or give them a sub-plot to keep them moving forward?\n\nMany many questions. Thankfully, I did not have to answer any of these, as Alcatraz walked up to the captive that Wright had bound and gagged, and removed his head executioner style.\n\nNow, this was the beginnings of the inter-party tension. As Wright and Alcatraz began yelling at each other in character, Mialee was looking around, bored.\n\nThis is when she nat 20'd a perception check.\n\nFarther down the road, the Caravan had continued to move, and was now entering a stretch of forest that separated the Capital from the next city, Zant. And Mialee noticed the large group of riders streaming out of the forest and surrounding the Caravan.\n\nWith several loud curses, the party double timed it across the considerable distance, closing in on the twelve or so Bandits that were in the midst of raiding the wagons. Johnson was herding his men around, trying to save the most valuable items, while having others extinguish fires that the bandits were setting to destroy what they weren't taking.\n\nThus the party burst in on the scene, and began to vent their frustration at being outsmarted on murdering everything within reach.\n\nThey quickly cut through about nine of the bandit horde, before Mialee received an unpleasant surprise: the burliest of the Bandits running up next to her, and hitting her for over half of her (considerable) hp pool.\n\nNow, this startled the players out of their Murderous Rage, and prompted them to start rolling to identify what the Bandit Chief had just done. Alcatraz succeed on a Religion check, and realized that the Chief had used Smite: Good, and the he was a Paladin of Tyranny.\n\nHe then decides that this is an insult to his character personally, and tells the other two to step back, cause he's \"got this\".\n\nYes, the level 5 warlock is going to take on the level 5 Paladin of Tyranny.\n\nBy himself.\n\nSo the other two turned and began beating on the sturdily built Lv 3 Fighters, while the Warlock attempted to solo the Mini-Boss I had built\n\nKey word is attempted.\n\nSo, after the two tanks finished mopping up the Fighters, they turned to find the Warlock in a bloody beaten pulp, but still alive. Surprisingly. At this point, the two ask if Alcatraz would like any help.\n\nAfter some grumbling, he agrees, and the three team up and make short work of the Paladin. After which, Alcatraz cuts of his hands and removes the finger bones. This became a thing at this point in the game, as the prestige class he was aiming for involved sacrificing the fingers of people to cause his eldritch blast to gain necrotic effects. Or something along those lines. It has been a while, and I don't care to go through the 3rd party books looking for the class he was going for.\n\nWell, all well that ends well, and the party set off on its merry way towards Zant.\n\nNow, this is where the session ended, but the next session was rather short, as Mialee wasn't able to attend, so I will tell you about the Wright and Alcatraz's Buddy Hunter Adventure.\n\nPicture the scene: its a beautiful summer day, the sun is shinning, the grass by the lake is glistening in a slight rain fall, little woodland creatures frolic peacefully.\n\nThen Wright and Alcatraz enter the glade, blades drawn, fire, both eldritch and divine crackling around their hands. The Animals look up, startled by the sudden intrusion of these creatures.\n\nBut they're hopeful. Maybe, if they don't move, these two entities will go away? Maybe they'll even be peaceful?\n\nThree rounds later...\n\nThere are several smouldering craters in the ground, where bunnies once stood. A deer lies splattered over a nearby boulder, its legs having been removed by sword strikes. Several squirrels have been turned into charcoal against the trees they tried to escape up, and the two now sit by a fire, cooking an owl that wright had grabbed before it could flee.\n\nWhile they wait, they players are joking about what a great idea it had been to go explore the forest while they waited for Mialee's player to show up (she ended up calling out, but not for an hour or so...).\n\nMeanwhile, I am rolling checks to see how the forest responds to the sound of murdering small animals, and the smell now emanating from the roasted corpses and the fire pit.\n\nThus, a group of wolves stalks out of the forest to try and filch some prey from the unwary adventurers.\n\nIt goes about as well as you can expect. The players brutally cut down the wolves, despite it being a decent sized pack. By the end, they have around 6 or 7 pelts that they managed to salvage from the corpses, and are now cooking the wolf meat.\n\nThis is when Wright gets an idea: if the scent of the owl had accidentally drawn a group of wolves, what could they get on purpose?\n\nThis, they began fanning the smell of cooking meat into the forests depths, Wright waving his wings to create a breeze, and Alcatraz feeding the flames to get a good roast going on the wolf meat.\n\nThis goes on for several minutes, them speculating just what they might get. I am making rolls to determine what exactly appears.\n\nThey were very unlucky.\n\nFrom the depths of the forest, they hear a low, rumbling growl. Not something guttural and angry, nor something like a warning or threat.\n\nNo, its more of a deep, rumbling, ravenous growl. The kind that signals a deep, needy hunger.\n\nThe players exchange looks, then book it up nearby trees, hiding to see what exactly they had summoned forth.\n\nThey didn't need to wait long. The trees began to shudder a little as  a huge, 11 foot long Bear lumbered out of the treeline. Its nose twitched as it eyed the clearing, now reeking of cooked meat and dead animals. Seeing no-one, the bear slowly crossed the distance, and began to paw at the wolf carcass slowly cooking over the fire, salivating slightly.\n\nThe players, too, were salivating. When I had given them this little sub-quest to tide them over, some of the townsfolk had made mention of something big in the woods stealing livestock. They hadn't been interested at the time, but Alcatraz had noticed that there was a reward to be had.\n\nSo, a plan was hatched. As the Great Bear began to slowly tear strips from the wolf carcass, the two players dropped down behind it, rolling to land silently. Then, Alcatraz began to chant softly.\n\nNext thing the bear knew, it was being bathed in gouts of Eldritch Hellfire. Wright closed the distance, then uppercut the bear in the jaw, launching it backwards through the turn-spit and into the lake. Both players celebrated on their improvised sneak attack.\n\nThen the bear rose up out of the waves.\n\nPicture if you will: an 11 foot tall, angry bear, covered in black and red flames that will not be extinguished, steam rising off its haunches as the war evaporates. Then it roars, prompting both players to roll vs crapping themselves and fleeing in terror.\n\nThe make it. Barely.\n\nWhile Alcatraz begins to hurl blast after blast of eldritch fire, interspersing it with his other invocations, Wright began to fight hand to hand with the Great Bear.\n\nNow, let me tell you about this bear. I had originally taken the Dire Bears stats and then... improved them. By mixing in a little bit of the stats for the Tyrannous Rex found in the animals section of the 3.5 Monster Manual. And now it was on fire.\n\nI may have been a dick, but this thing was supposed to face a full party, not the glass cannon and the blaster-lock.\n\nBut rest assured, dear readers. This was not the end of the party. No, this is when I learned why it was a bad idea to let Wright be a Homebrew. See, when he was being designed, there was a mechanic put into the race called the Blood Rage. That, under the full moon, caused the characters to basically turn into mini super novas of fire and berserk furry.\n\nTo counter this, they had special monk classes that learned to harness and suppress the rage, with the help of copious amounts of drugs. But, in times of stress and danger, they could harness the rage to be even better and more deadly than when un-altered.\n\nBasically, he could go Super Sayian.\n\nThis is when I found out how much like Super Sayian it was. Wright activated his Blood Rage, and gained an aura that dealt fire damage around him in an AoE that grew with level. His fists began to channel divine fire stronger than normal, and he could hurl fire blasts.\n\nSo, now, the peaceful glade is a war-zone. The ground is being baked, and partially glassing around the water line. The water itself is evaporating from the heat, filling the area with steam, and the tree line is beginning to smoulder, threatening to start a forest fire.\n\nIn the midst of this, Wright is playing punch out with the 11 foot tall bear. The two are trading blows, with Wright quaffing potions of his own blood to regain health. Oh, yeah, his blood was a modified healing potion, but he could only make a few a day, and they went bad after a month, since they lost their reviving properties. The race was based on Phoenixes after all.\n\nAlcatraz is supplying as much support as he can, but this bear had almost a hundred health and a regenerating factor of one, since it ate some of a druids secret stash. This they never found out, but the players were panicking as the thing kept standing back up as they beat on it, and the fight dragged on.\n\nIt was glorious, one of the high points of the campaign, when Wright's player finally lost it and screamed \"I punch into its chest and rip out its heart!\"\n\nThe Bear hit 0 HP from his attack.\n\nIt was one of the most satisfying moments as a gamemaster to watch the players, who had struggled for close to an hour to kill the damned bear, celebrate that they had managed to triumph. No punches were pulled, nothing was fudged, and they were in real danger. But they prevailed.\n\nOf all the fights that happened in this campaign, this is one of the few that I feel had a lasting impact on them. And its one of the only ones that I enjoyed, as the steady power creep of their characters gradually rendered everything child's play to them.\n\nThere is only one other fight that I feel had the same \"Oh, crud\" moment for the players as seeing that bear for the first time, and its near the end of my long-winded tail. So, when we get to it I'll tell you.\n\nBut, for now, I shall leave you on the high note of the players triumphing, and skinning the bear. Next time, I'll tell you what they did with its pelt. Cause that's a story and a half.\n\nEdit: [The Next Part!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3ubhf6/the_three_players_that_broke_dd_part_3_the_bear/)",

        "text": "Below is an accounting of a game I am currently running. I'm the GM of the game so I basically have an over reaching store and then react to what the players do from there. One of the players took it upon himself to start transcribing notes from our sessions. They are so funny I decided to share them with you. This comes from notes that were posted on 06/29/2015\n\nApril 6 2501\nWe left the temple that now serves as a resting place for Devin's character and Trashcan man. Now we make way for the place where we plane to drop that nasty nuke. Kat, and I think Ed, paint images on the bomb (I believe they were kangaroos or something).\n\nApril 7th\nWe approach the site where bomb is supposed to be delivered. Deep, deep into the dark and dank jungle sits a temple of DOOM. Boy is it dank. We paint the ship to look like the sky on bottom and grass on top, so as to fool those who dare stand in the way of our delivery of death. I am sure plans are already in motion in the minds of the mighty warriors to repaint the ship with the splendid logo SPARKLE MOTION!!\n\nApril 8th\nKat decides to venture out in the jungle to see what the hell these fiendish freaks are trying to bring up from the toilet bowl of hell. Hark! there seems to be something moving while she is trying to sneak up to the temple of DOOM. She sees something alien, as in not of this world. Alas the alien being is not the predator, but something else that seems like it is not natural to this world . Far off into the distance, past the trees and such, Kat sees Shipley, remember him? I barely do, on top of the temple of DOOM. He is chanting things only heard amongst the foul beasts of hell, and maybe in New Jersey. Once we learn what those freaky creatures can do, something about laying eggs in us, we go to the most logical of decisions DROP THE BOMB!!! EVERYTHING MUST DIE!!!!!!!\nOh crap! Oh crap! Oh crap! We really screwed the pooch on this one. The bomb went off, Shipley is dead (alas no frog legs for dinner) and now a big ass devil has appeared. It looks REALLY scary, like code brown level scary. But thankfully that big bad booty demon is on his way east. We go the opposite direction as any intelligent being would do.\nAs we were trying to make like my pants and split, we are attacked by a nasty assassin gnome, that's right a assassin gnome. Thankfully we beat her like she owed us money. Hell she might have. Tied it up and stripped her, only of gear thankfully.\nFound a letter that says within Mexico city there will be resistance figure of high position (Oh no! Did they catch Marty? And what of Doc Brown?) that will be moved through the city on the 24th of April. If Chris, the gnome assassin, would have gotten Kat, then she would have been given a position as a guard. So a gnome assassin/guard? Looks like Snooki found work after all.\nAs we decide to get info from the gnome, I search the ship for a car battery and jumper cables. Chris appears to have a contact at a bar called the Slippery Unicorn Nest ..... no really, in Mexico City. Kat had some slippery unicorn with the gnome. My god the things I heard, my mind may never be right again.\n\nApril 11th \nHola Mexico! La Cucarach! La Cucaracha! We left the airship with the gnomes, Slappy is told to fly it around, and listen for the iRock if we get into trouble. The gate surrounding the city is guarded, the sound of snapping rubber gloves and cavity searches echos in the mind.Trying to sneak into city we come up with a cover called Swine Seller Inc .... I wanted Good Porkin' yet was out voted. The plan is simple, smuggle our weapons in with pig parts.\n\nApril 12th\nWe go in search of pig parts and find a ranch with a slaughter house. W meet with a sexy little mama named Polly, the woman I will someday let turn me down for a date, and her boss. The boss did not fall for our brilliant idea and attempts at diplomacy, and we were denied some pork parts. The new plan is to bribe the courier to help us out, who was on the way into the city to get some papers. Paid him gold,fed him and let him watch Kat sleep, a good night for all. Slept and had a dream about the The Resurrector, a being that made me feel good in my dreams, yet wake up wet. My god told me not to trust him, guess that means we should trust him then right?\n\nApril 13th\nCourier went off and met with the boss. SWEET! it worked and we are now getting the pig parts. Putting the weapons in a bag O holdin' and stuffing it in pig guts. That should make it so guards hopefully wont find our shit. Right? Keeping fingers crossed, as well as other body parts. One guard smelled the dirty, nasty, festering, stinky, pig parts and tossed his cookies. I am left to wonder who will clean up that mess. Chris goes about her merry way, after a few threats and possible winks. I gave her four gold pieces, now I am paying for others sexual adventures. When will Christos get his own booty?. Found a room, and got some info about some holy men looking for an item. They hang out at this bar called the Grand Knight Grado. Also heard about some old world tech found somewhere around Monte Tlaloc. Plus we got that whole thing with the high resistance member. ITS A TRAP!!!!! Thank you Akbar.. so the high resistance thing smells fishier then a whore with a coupon. We decide to go with the holy men first. We pay the five gold to the big ass bouncer to get into the bar. We go all out with the disguises, Ed with his silver spurs, Kat with her, well Kat is always in disguise. And me looking not just fly, but mutha lovin Supa Fly! We find and meet the Green Priests at the bar in the mid afternoon. At first they are not impressed with us, dicks. We win them over of course. Five more gold to get back in and meet those guys again. They tell us they are seeking assistance in finding an item. These green dudes notice, and are interested in the book I got from the Trashcan Man. Upon further inspection the cover of the book is stretched leather, with the edges being razor sharp steel. The cleric goes to hand the book to the green priests and ...oh he died by touching the book. The group sells the book. Now my ASSHOLE teammates buried me and looted my body. I am NEVER HEALING THEM AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!! Finally dug me up and pulled a gun on me, I think I peed a little. But hey I got paid 5,000 gold so all is well in the house of SPARKLE MOTION!!!!",

        "text": "It’s my first time story-telling. Please be gentle.\n\nA few weeks ago, my role-playing group decided to restart the universe, as it were, and roll new characters. I've always liked to do silly things in our games, but this time I decided to go hardcore. I decided to do play a character that was as simultaneously stupid and somehow helpful as possible. Thus was born the half-orc bard Ringo Waugh. \n\nRingo was a simple fellow, enjoying wine women and song. Despite lacking actual combat training Ringo had learned how to use any mundane object possible to cause pain. Coupled with Ringo's borderline super (half) human strength, Ringo was no slouch in a fight. Ringo could **Throw Anything**, and in a bar fight could use anything from a barstool to a beer bottle to **Catch Off-Guard** nearly any opponent. In addition, Ringo the Bard had the ability to summon instruments. Naturally, there is a limitation on this ability, being that he can only summon an instrument that can be held in two hands. But considering how strong Ringo was, this rather loose definition allowed him to summon any instrument that weighed at or less than 400 pounds. And as luck would have it, the average small upright piano weighed just in at 400 pounds.\n\nSoon enough, Ringo found himself performing in a bar where he met an Ifrit Sorcerer, a Dwarven Barbarian, a Human Warrior, and a 13 year old Wizard with a magical talking tiger (long story). Deciding he wasn't getting enough money from tips, Ringo decided to join up with the adventurers to investigate the mysterious map that had been found by the (DM controlled) loli wizard. After following the map and the young wizard, the group came across a strange cave hidden underneath a rock.\n\nAfter fighting our way through magical traps, pitfalls, and a swarm of spiders (which proved no match for the pyromaniacal Ifrit), they came across a fork in the road. The wizard decided to take the left path with her tiger, while the rest decided to go on the right. Very little of interest happened to the group on the right (although Ringo did discover that a piano could be used to effectively fill a pitfall), until they finally came across the Wizard and her Tiger, knocked out cold in the middle of a large room. Concerned about whatever it was that had harmed the Wizard (who was the one paying them to explore the damned cave in the first place), the Dwarf, Ifrit and Human decided to go ahead while Ringo stayed back to watch over the Wizard. Growing bored, Ringo decided to summon his piano and play a few songs, putting out his tip jar in case the bats were feeling generous.\n\nAfter a few minutes of fruitless searching and piano tunes, Ringo decided to join the group to see if he could help in any way other than entertainment. Then, all of a sudden, they heard it. The small, sharp clink of metal on glass. Ringo, not wanting to be caught without his weapon, rushed to his piano, only to find a horrible sight leering above it. A Lich, of rotten flesh and tattered robes, grinned frightfully over the piano, having placed a single copper in the tip jar. Momentarily stunned by the sight of such a terrible being, Ringo composed himself and did what any self respecting musician would do. He hefted his piano high above his head, and brought it crashing down upon the cheap-ass Lich. The Lich, obviously not expecting such resistance, was surprised to find himself pinned underneath 400 pounds of wood and ivory. \n\nStruggling to compose himself, the Lich decided that the best course of action would be to summon a huge fireball. Raising his one free hand above the piano, he began summoning a great ball of magical fire which then proceeded to explode, sending shockwaves throughout the room. Ringo could barely hold on from being so close to the blast, while the dwarf suddenly found himself without beard as the flames burned around him. The human warrior had the sense to step clear of the blast, while the Ifrit, being a fire elemental, could have hardly cared less. So, after knocking Ringo onto his now slightly singed ass, the Lich now found himself underneath a **burning** piano, which the Lich probably found to be an even **worse** situation. Fortunately for Ringo (and unfortunately for the Lich) the rest of the party was still in fighting condition, and proceeded to spend the next minute or so hacking away at the horror. After knocking off the creatures arm and most of his jaw, the warrior was able to pull off a coup-de-grace upon the hapless undead, ripping his longsword clean through the top of its head.\n\nAnd thus did end the first adventure of Ringo Waugh, the Half-Orc Pianist who now badly needed a costume kit to cover up the fact that both of his eyebrows were gone. Instead of fake eyebrows, however, the Lich instead carried the wondrous Belt of Mighty Hurling, which the party graciously allowed Ringo to keep, so that he could toss pianos with great strength and distance at any foe the group might come across. \n",

        "text": "So this was sort of (100%) my own fault.\n\nHere's what went down: I was a first-time GM for a bunch of first-time players. I had been playing D&amp;D for about a year at this time, and I was familiar with some of the infamous magic game-destroying trinkets (Bag of Holding + Portable Hole, Rings of Invisibility, etc.). I had outright banned Rings of Invisibility, and didn't plan on allowing my players to get easy access to certain magical items. We played the campaign online through Roll20, and I used a random loot generator some of the time. Back then, I had a \"tell it like it is\" sort of mentality - I wouldn't lie about my GM rolls, and this level of honesty extended into loot drops as well.\n\n* Generate Random Loot -&gt; Moderate Magic Item\n* Deck of Many Things\n\nUuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh...\n\nMy reaction over voice chat was enough to make the whole party intrigued. After explaining the potential campaign-ending possibilities, they only wanted to try it out even more. It was initially a 13 card deck with no replacement and I had each player declare how many cards they wanted to pull before they started pulling. This eventually turned into a fully stacked deck WITH replacement, because if you're going to cause shenanigans, they might as well be full-blown shenanigans. \n\nThe party was comprised of a Druid, Rogue, Barbarian, a male Ranger, and a female Ranger, all at level 5 or 6. This campaign took place over 3 years ago, so I can't recall every detail and the order of events may be a bit messed up.\n\n\n* Barbarian pulls - Gem. A pile of money falls at his feet. Both in and out of character, everyone thinks this is awesome. Hands reach for the deck.\n\n* Female Ranger pulls - Rogue (I allowed this to affect PCs). The Barbarian is suddenly filled with anger as the Ranger touches HIS deck. He swings at her, and she flees the crypt they were looting. Party scolds him, but not for long, as he says that everyone else is still allowed to use the deck, so they continue pulling.\n\n* Barbarian pulls again - Key. A blazing sword of ethereal energy appears in  his hands. He likes.\n\n* Rogue pulls - Star. She gets increased Dexterity.\n\n* Druid pulls - Flames. Some random outsider hates him now (not that he knows that).\n\n* Male Ranger pulls - Knight. A level 3 human fighter spawns from a puff of smoke, valiantly declaring his dedication to him. Ranger gets all giddy and excited.\n\n* Barbarian pulls - Ruin. All of his money is gone, effectively undoing his Gem card. His original sword disappears as well, but he's already clinging happily to his new one. He also loses possession of his house, which I tell him out of character. I let him keep his non-magical armor, at least.\n\n* Rogue pulls - Throne. Normally, she'd gain a small keep. She asks for the Barbarian's house instead. I roll a d100, giving her a 25% chance to randomly become the new owner of the deed. She gets it.\n\n* Druid pulls - Comet. Kill your next enemy alone, earn a level up. Nice.\n\n* Male Ranger pulls - Fates. Undo the next bad thing that happens to you. Also nice.\n\n* Female Ranger cowering outside with the cemetery groundskeeper.\n\n* Barbarian pulls - Idiot. Loses 1 Intelligence. No one notices a difference.\n\n* Rogue pulls - Moon. A wish! Hot damn. She holds onto it.\n\n* Druid pulls - Skull. A Dread Wraith appears before him. Remember the Flames card? Yeah, this Dread Wraith considers him its mortal enemy for no distinguishable reason. But hey, if he kills it alone, he levels up! He Wild Shapes into some creature with a burrow speed and digs through the wall, trying to escape to the surface.\n\n* Dread Wraith phases into the wall to follow. The party shrugs and goes back to the deck.\n\n* Male Ranger - The Void! Away with your soul! Oh. His Fates card effect activates, sparing him.\n\n* Female Ranger sees the Druid claw his way up out of the ground, Dread Wraith in tow.\n\n* Barbarian pulls - Flames. Some random Dread Wraith hates you, too. Must be something about looting a crypt that's pissing off all these ghosts.\n\n* Rogue pulls - Moon. Another wish? Are you real?\n\n* Male Ranger pulls - Vizier. He knows the answer to the next problem that arises.\n\n* Barbarian pulls - Skull. A new Dread Wraith appears. Ohgoditshappening.\n\n\nAt this point, the Female Ranger and Druid are trying to fight the first Dread Wraith. The groundskeeper goes into a nearby shed and takes out some healing potions and starts pouring them on it to deal damage. The Male Ranger thinks things are getting out of hand. His Vizier card activates and he knows he has to use his magical trinket of communication (They all had one - It enabled use of the spell Sending to speak only with a powerful Archmage) to ask the Archmage for help.\n\nRogue keeps drawing cards alone in the crypt with a devilish smile. Ends up pulling Gem (money), Fates (prevent bad thing), Donjon (imprisonment - prevented), Jester (bonus XP), TWO MORE MOON CARDS (she's up to four wishes!!!), Balance (alignment change, undone with a wish), and a Skull, earning her a Dread Wraith of her own.\n\nThe Archmage teleports in and begins damage control, banishing the wraiths (who maintain their hatred for the party characters), and wiping the Barbarian's recent memory to keep him from attacking the Female Ranger. When all was said and done... It was a total mess. I was left with a happier-than-he-should-have-been Barbarian with nothing to his name but his armor and shiny new sword, an over-leveled rich Rogue with a new house and three damn wishes, an unhappy Druid, one Ranger with a new buddy (I was actually happy for him, at least), and another Ranger who felt left out and kept shooting angry glares at the Barbarian even after the cause of the sudden anger was explained by the Archmage. \n\nLooking back on it, it was actually pretty hilarious to think that such powerful adventurers could get so terribly sidetracked by gambling on a deck of cards that could potentially ruin your life. It has become a fond memory for everyone that had been involved, and the campaign concluded with very little derailment even after such extensive interaction with a game-breaking trinket.",

        "text": "(little extra note to readers: the events occurred like this to the best of my memory and that of the witnesses I asked, since it was a little murky at first. I didn't magically record everything he said, but I know how he talks, and I know how he argues. For that reason, consider this a re-construction of what happened in the dialogue)\n\nI had to dig deep in my memory and even ask some of my long-time players to make sure I got some parts of this right, but because it was in high demand, here is the story of the first of two times that my largest and most recent group kicked M out, even though it meant no more free food and drink and a \"mancave\" built for our use (which looking back is a little creepy). It took long enough, but this is the tale of the first \"last straw\" moment. Mind you, he came back later and compelled the group to return to him, so there may be a follow-up later regarding that.\n\nAs a tiny bit of background, the party had an airship, or more specifically, an articulated, mechanical vessel in the shape of a dragon, that could breathe fire, fly, and do a lot of things dragons could do, and was powered by music (music was a central thematic focus of that campaign, as the creator goddess of the campaign world was a bard at the time). Appropriately, the vessel was named Firesong.\n\nWell, of course, M pushed and shoved and bludgeoned the other players with his ego in previous sessions, and made himself captain of this fine vessel. He kept complaining that it wasn't powerful enough, that other airships could fight back, deal damage to it, that it needed to get repaired sometimes, you name it. That wasn't new news, but his complaints about taking damage also extended to \"his\" ship, which was supposed to belong to the party. Oh, I forgot to mention, he constantly said out loud that he was the \"Han Solo\" of the group, but I don't recall Han Solo being so loud and clumsy and boorishly insecurely macho. M was as smooth as low-grid sandpaper.\n\nSo, upgrades were in order. As a DM that was a believer in \"Yes, and\" as a policy, I said upgrades were possible, but will require exotic techonological artifacts that- aaaaaaand I was cut off.\n\n\"THIS CLICHED OLD BULLSHIT.\" The bellow was back. \"HOW COME IN SO MANY FUCKING STORIES, ALL THE OLD SHIT IS BETTER THAN NEW SHIT? THAT'S NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS!\"\n\nYep, he was one of those guys. You know, adds \"SCIENCE!\" as a tribalistic buzzword to show how enlightened by his own intelligence he is. Come to think of it, I remember way back before I even found D&amp;D, but I was still into fantasy settings as a pre-teen, an early experience with M, when I wanted to play what was basically LARPing without knowing what it meant to pretend to be a character while fighting with toy swords, one of M's early demands to participate was \"no magic. Magic is fake. You can pretend to be a wizard, but you're just throwing gunpowder.\" Yep that's right, I could pretend to be a wizard that was pretending to be a wizard. SCIENCE!\n\nAnyway, back to the story. The group seemed uncomfortable, and very tired of his crap by then. \"The DM is giving us an adventure hook.\"\n\n\"I'M SICK OF THESE BORING FANTASY CLICHES! ABOUT... ANCIENT BULLSHIT.\" This coming from the guy that wanted Lord of the Rings movie soundtrack music with every game, and absolutely had to play a dudebro white dude who looked just like himself in real life, but with better stats.\n\nThe group continued to look uncomfortable. I tried to break the awkwardness, \"Could I give you the adventure hook now?\"\n\n\"NO! THIS ISN'T JUST *YOUR* STUPID CLICHED STORY!\"\n\n\"Oh, you want to DM?\" I said to him, at wit's end and feeling acidic.\n\n\"WHO'S WITH ME?\" he did this dramatic, arms outstretched, Xerxes-like creepy gesture.\n\n\"For what?\" one asked.\n\n\"No more magic bullshit. No more ancient technology cliches. No more faggoty PC save-the-world shit. No more feminist preaching from some fucking virgin.\"\n\nBeing around M too long would make anyone but M eventually a bit more feminist. It's like getting treated for cancer makes you interested in cancer research.\n\nOne of my old guard, silent til now during all of this, asked, \"Okay. What the fuck is left?\"\n\nIf I played Bioshock at the time, I would have said, mockingly to M, \"No DMs, no rules. Only M\"\n\nBy this time, somehow, enough time blew by now, that the session fizzled out, clumsily. No resolution, not even a clear indication of what was going to happen next. M muttered that he was a grown-ass man (generally people who say that are manchildren, I have noticed) that had a grown-ass job he had to do tomorrow, so he quickly finished his wine and lumbered out of the \"man-cave\". (I don't have optimistic appraisals of people who use this one, either)\n\nThat's when the group met outside, and the vote of \"fuck M\" was made, before we dispersed.",
