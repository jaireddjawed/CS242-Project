Why?  What is wrong with admitting that part of a healthy relationship is lust? \n\nEdit: to clarify the part about the importance of sex, I mean that a couple who treats each other well might/often ignore the fact that they aren’t having good sex or aren’t particularly attracted to one another physically because other parts of the relationship are good. Yet I often hear down the road how much it becomes an issue, potentially leading to cheating or ending a relationship. So my question is why do people act like it isn’t an issue when it usually becomes one down the road, a well established phenomenon? \n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the Reddit Gold! ",

Obviously because of the exponential growth of technological advance we have no way to know for sure about any of this.\n\nMe and a couple of friends were hanging out today. We were talking about the general shift in society that is occurring and will occur as automation/AI/\"information age\" tech develops and becomes commonplace in our civilisation.\n\nMy view was originally that a violent revolution was unlikely since future tech will slowly resolve the needs of the average individual, through massively automated farming and manufacturing. Perhaps we will have UBI or some other means of every individual having their basic needs met.\n\nFriend 'S' thought differently - she said that the value offered by those technologies won't be adequate quickly enough to solve the problem of nearly the entire working class population: people who's jobs are being lost to automation, and are now subject to even greater poverty and inequality than ever before. She suggested that there will be a natural \"tipping point\" where public dissent culminates in violent revolution. In fact, she made specific examples about this starting to occur within the last year in her home town in France, where civil unrest seemed to form rapidly. Within weeks, a general atmosphere of anger propagated and developed into actual demonstrations in the street, which were suppressed by the government.\n\nI am still overall convinced the violent revolution feels unlikely - people will silence themselves with smartphones and consumption so long as there is nothing actively awful happening in their everyday lives. But she has definitely challenged my (now embarrassingly naive) original assumptions about the way the situation is going to play out.\n\nWhat do you think?",
