        "text": "Upon finally seeing Call Me By Your Name, I walked out of the cinema thinking this should win best picture. Second perhaps only to Lady Bird, it's a movie that ticks all my boxes of what a best picture Oscar winner should be without feeling like Oscar bait for a second. But immediately following my elation over the beautifully shot and powerfully acted movie I had just seen, I started to think about the conflicts in the movie and realized there were none. I just watched over two hours of fantasy and wishful thinking that had every opportunity to show various conflicts, but it didn't. Call Me By Your Name never has a sense of urgency, there is never a threat, and it never becomes tragic. It's a romantic fairy tale.\n\nOne of the most obvious conflicts that the movie skipped was that of doomed love. The clock ticking on their relationship is the only obstacle they face, but it's a downplayed non-issue between them, because Oliver and Elio begin their relationship with the understanding that it will be short-lived. Oliver is just visiting and this will be a summer fling. They both know their relationship is destined to end (pretty soon) and they accept it quite easily. The only time this becomes any kind of issue is a single scene when Elio expresses regret that they wasted time circling each other at the beginning of Oliver's visit instead of getting it on immediately. In the end, even though Elio is sad to see Oliver leave, it's a moment they both knew was coming and the deadline for their love was never shown to be a burden or a cause for any sort of anxiety.\n\nApart from being doomed from the start, their relationship is also forbidden fruit. It's forbidden for two reasons and neither becomes an issue or a source of conflict. The first reason is the age difference between them. It's established that Elio is 17, which would make Oliver a sexual offender in the eyes of the law. And, since he knows Elio is 17 and he still initiates a relationship (probing Elio's willingness with a shoulder rub), this can in fact be viewed as predatory behavior. What is this adult man doing propositioning the under-age son of his host to have some fun over the summer? This is never addressed in the movie, however, and it never creates any conflict. The threat of exposure, which would put Oliver in legal trouble, isn't a concern for either of them, and the fact that their love is literally forbidden is completely downplayed.\n\n**EDIT:** It's been pointed out to me that Italy's age of consent is lower and so there is no legal issue. Fair enough, I had no idea. However, it makes me question Oliver's character even more. Him being American and coming to Italy from America, where the age is 18, only to pursue a younger boy feels like predatory behavior as well. It's like he's getting a free pass to be with a teenager during his trip, which he can't do at home.\n\nThe other reason has nothing to do with the law and it's figurative rather than literal. Their relationship is figuratively forbidden because it's a homosexual relationship. They keep their orientation a secret for various reasons, but none of those reasons come into play during the movie and none are a source for conflict. There is no mention of persecution, discrimination, AIDS, losing face, or any other reason why someone might stay in the closet. Elio is perhaps concerned that his parents might find out, but even this simple secret-keeping adds no strain on the relationship and no conflict to the plot. In fact, the movie does the exact opposite. During the movie, it's not clear whether or not Elio's parents know anything about the relationship, but they certainly drop heavy hints when they express their full support and encouragement of Elio and Oliver's *friendship.* In the case of Elio's mother, it remains ambiguous how much she knew, but in one of the film's closing scenes (and in my opinion the one most idealized), Elio's father reveals that he knows. He gives a beautiful, emotionally charged speech that reveals his knowledge of the affair and his support and understanding of it, which negates the little anxiety Elio might have had over being found out. The little bit of conflict there might have been is swept off the table when Elio learns that being gay was no cause for concern and there was no need to hide it. It's a beautiful thing to have supportive parents like that and I'm sure there are many loving people out there just like Elio's father, but in the context of this already conflict-less movie, his speech feels like the cherry on top of a fantasy sundae. It's every scared, closeted man's hope and dream realized. \"Yeah, your parents will be totally ok with it\" is the movie's key idealized message. \"Being gay is perfectly ok and no cause for conflict\" is a statement that is factually true. There is nothing wrong with being gay. But it's a statement that, when confronted with reality (and especially reality of the 1980s), is at best unrealistic and at worst dishonest in its ignorance of actual struggle. In short, Elio's father's speech is what every gay man wants to hear, but few will. (Also of note is that Elio's father is not only ok with his son's homosexuality, he is also totally ok with his under-age son having sex with an older man that he himself invited under his roof.)\n\nRegarding the unrealistically easy acceptance of Elio's sexual orientation, there is another conflict within the movie that turns into idealized wishful thinking. Elio starts the summer pursuing Marzia. They briefly date and they deflower each other. Then Elio rather unceremoniously dismisses her with a shrug of the shoulder, thereby breaking her heart. But there is no remorse to be felt for Elio, no inner conflict to be had over what he did to her, because in the conflict-less world of the movie, Marzia inexplicably forgives Elio for breaking her heart (something that seems all the more unrealistic given that this is the boy who took her virginity and then dumped her without a word) and confirms her unchanged affection for him. It's not clear whether she figured it out and forgave Elio because she knew he is gay, though this is unlikely. In any case, her feelings end up being one more thing Elio needn't worry about and one less reason why not to love Oliver. (Oliver seems to have been in a similar situation. It is revealed at the end that he got engaged to a woman he's had an on-again-off-again relationship with for a few years. However, throughout the movie he shows no inner conflict over choosing between her and being openly gay and no struggle with potentially dumping a woman who seems to love him. It's one more conflict the movie ignores in favor of showing the most ideal, perfect summer romance.)\n\nAt first I thought of Call Me By Your Name as a coming-of-age movie. But in such movies the protagonist usually faces adversity and/or overcomes obstacles that make him grow up. That is not Elio's case. Call Me By Your Name feels like someone's day dream or sexual fantasy scenario. Elio faces no adversity, overcomes no obstacle, and nothing makes him grow up (other than missing a lover he knew would leave). He starts the movie bored during summer and he ends the movie loved and accepted by everyone around him, having gone through no conflicts.\n\n\n",

        "text": "For anyone who has had a run of mischief in their lives, particularly while living in nyc, this film runs deep. Given, there were moments through the story where we were brushing (or fully pushing) the absurd, I  the wrapup really gave me the shivers. I saw two endings here: One in which RP is staring into the lens. The other, his brother, while the credits are rolling. It reminded me of a lost-in-space sensation when one hits bottom. It conjured memories of the end of Pola X, and the running and running at the end of 400 Blows. \n\nI don't know if I've been so rapt by a sound design / soundtrack since Lynch's Mullholland Drive. It's funny I was driven to finally see GT almost immediately after hearing Iggy Pop's collaboration with Oneohtrix. Given the heavy digital nature of the soundtrack, it'll be interesting to see how a re-watch will go in 5-10 years from now. \n\nThere were many messy societal themes going on here. I'm having some trouble grounding that. One moment that has me particularly curious is the flash of Pepe (comic character framed during the party/fucking scene). This had to be entirely intentional, but why... what is this? I'd be happy to read, or watch an interview with the filmmakers but I like attempting an articulation on my own. Unfortunately, in this case I don't know where to begin. What do you think? \n\nI'm also very inspired when I see an actor whom I previously categorized as 'just pretty' or typecast, express some range. I didn't recognize RP here, nor did I think he behaved anything like the vampire boy. Not to mention Benny Safdie  who I'll be keeping a really close eye on. And so many of those ancillary characters are like so many of the real people I met while living in the city. \n\nI might agree to some extent this is the stuff of cliche stew. I see Mr. Robot, Requiem for a Dream, the titles I mentioned earlier, plus some of COPS, a carrying on of Oliver Stone, and so forth. But for me, these are stories that never get old. ",

However I would really love to see a paradigm shift, where Europe for instance would become the mainstream of cinema. Americans, afaik, are not very willing to watch films with subtitles. But a large portion of the world are already used to that watching American films without english being their native language. A big difference would certainly be the demographic aspect. In LA you've such as a large industry covered in such small demographic area. If it was in Europe, you'd likely have people all over the place due to language and cultural barriers. \n\nDo you think we'll witness the decline of Hollywood during our lifetime?

I just watched Seventh Seal and read a few articles, but I still have many questions and confusions...\n\nSome characters I can understand. Jof and Mia are the ideal religious couple who do not concern themselves with existential matters and are the only ones who survive. This alludes to the fact that we should live our lives rather than spend our time philosophizing. \n\nJons is the atheist. When Death comes for him, he is not afraid at all. He too, like Jof and Mia, seems to have lived an admirable life. Throughout the entire film, he has been confident in his actions; again, he is a character that is made admirable for not spending his time questioning the world and faith. \n\nHowever, everybody else confuses me. First and foremost there is Antonius Block. He spends his time futilely trying to find God, confirm the existence of the spiritual world, avoid death... he even confidently plays a chess game with death, forming the backbone of the movie. However at the end, he is reduced to a blabbering fool, desperately praying to God so he may live. He is obviously not at peace with death, even though the entire film death has not intimidated him and just about 10 minutes before his death, he sees Jof's family escaping and comments to Death that his respite was worth it. If Antonius thinks he accomplished something with his life, why is he scared of dying? What is Bergman trying to tell us with his character?\n\nThis is not to mention the other characters. I don't understand at all the role of the blacksmith and his wife, or the actor who died in the tree, or why the mute girl seems so excited by death (that minor character in particular receives a large amount of screentime in the arrival of Death scene which perplexes me). Does Antonius' wife hold any significance? Again, what is Bergman trying to tell us?\n\nAnd as a side note, the shot of the danse macabre is iconic, but I am not sure what it is supposed to mean...",

        "text": "I loved the character of Spider-Man my entire life. And I grew up with Sam Raimi's Spidey trilogy (I think Spider-Man 2 was the first film I saw in the theater). So when Spider-Man 3 was coming out, I was so excited. Not just because I love the first 2 films, they were also finally adapting the black suit/Venom storyline (Venom is my favorite Spider-Man villain and that's my favorite storylline) along with having Sandman and New Goblin. And when that film came out in May 2007, the seven year old me loved it and saw it three times in theaters (I've haven't done that with another film since then). But as I got older and got more into films and rewatched the movie, I started to see all its flaws. \n\nI've never hated this film though. There are some horrible aspects to it and some great aspects as well. Let's talk about them.\n\nThe film starts off pretty good with the opening titles (Raimi's Spider-Man films have some of the best opening titles I've ever seen and this one gives us darker/creepier score by Christopher Young when we see the symbiote) and us getting to see that Peter Parker has managed to balance his lives as Peter and Spider-Man really well. He's a beloved hero as Spider-Man and great collage student that finally got together with his true love as Parker.\n\nHowever after the first few minutes, some pacing issues start to kick in and some scene transitions feel off. Many people say that Spider-Man 3's biggest problem is that it crammed way too much stuff into one movie and didn't develop all of the stories enough. I agree with this. You have 3 villains and their origin stories, you have Peter and MJ's relationship issues, you have Harry getting amnesia, you have the black suit storyline, you have Gwen Stacy (For some reason), etc.\n\nSpeaking of the villains, let's talk about the first one introduced in the film, New Goblin (Who's never referred to that in the film. The closest we get is Peter calling Harry \"Goblin Jr\"). This is very exciting as the first 2 films having building towards the storyline of Harry taking up his father's mantle and turning against his best friend. And while the first fight between Peter and Harry looks cool, I have 2 big issues with it.\n\n1. The slow motion shot of Peter trying to grab the falling wedding ring with his webbing before Harry grabs him. Not only is that super corny, that ring should've been on the ground by the time Peter caught it.\n\n2. How does no one in New York see Peter and Harry's fight? That's been bothering me for years.\n\nAfter that fight, Harry gets amnesia until about halfway through the film when a visit Mary Jane ends badly and causes his memory to return (And a cool cameo from William Dafoe). This is feels iffy to me. It feels like the writers didn't know to do with New Goblin after fight until the climax of the film, so came up with a plot device that would allow Peter and Harry to be best friends again until then.\n\nSpeaking of the climax, in the theatrical cut of the film Harry finally helps Peter defeat Sandman and Venom after his butler finally told him the truth about what happened to his father. That scene is so stupid. Why would the butler wait that long to finally tell Harry the truth? But in the editor's cut of the film, they cut that scene out and replaced with a brief moment of Harry looking at a picture of him, Peter, and MJ hanging out. Missing those times and realizing the truth on his own, he goes to save his best friends. That is a much better scene and I'm not sure why they changed it. \n\nAnd his death at the end is handled really well IMO. He dies the same way his father did, but as a hero. And his and Peter's final exchange is heartbreaking. Little fun fact, Joe Magelino's Flash Thompson from the first film has a cameo at his funeral.\n\nNext up is Sandman. He is easily the best part of the film. Thomas Haden Church absolutely nailed it. I know some comic books fans were upset that they changed Flint Marko's backstory and have him be Uncle Ben's real killer, but I actually found it to be an interesting idea and it's important to Peter's arc in the film where he is consumed by rage and eventually has to let go of it and learn to forgive. And what what really consume Peter with rage and make him a prime target of the Venom suit? Finding out that his Uncle's killer is still out there. \n\nI also liked the changes that humanize Sandman more. He's only committing crimes because he's trying to pay for his daughter's illness (Probably cancer). There's a deleted scene that they put back in for the editor's cut where Sandman turns into a sand castle for his daughter before she leaves with her mom. He then promises that Spidey won't get in his way again. Not only is it a beautiful scene with a fantastic score from Christopher Young, it also better explains Marko's motivations for teaming up with Venom at the end. \n\nBut hands down the best Sandman moment (And IMO one of the best scenes in CBM) in the film is the whole Birth Of Sandman scene. Magnificent CGI, a beautiful score, and no dialogue. \n\nAnd with Venom, I like the symbiote throughout most of the film, but not so much Eddie Brock.\n\nThe scene where the Venom suit crawls onto Peter during  his nightmare is very well done and creepy (And the black Spidey suit looks great on screen). And when Peter finally takes it off at the church looking for redemption is great and creepy too (And leads to the cool Birth Of Venom moment). There's also a few more moments from the Editor's Cut that treats Peter's reliance on the suit like a drug addiction and I wish those scenes were always in the film. Christopher Young also gives the alien creature a very memorable theme (Bwehh). Although one thing about the suit confuses me. It bonds to Peter's Spidey suit, but when he finally takes it off it's just the black goo now.\n\nBut they did not do Eddie Brock justice. Why did they cast the guy from That 70's Show to play Venom? Just why? Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Topher Grace. I think he's a good actor in the right roles, but this wasn't one of them. I don't buy him as a true threat for Spider-Man and he just comes across as a little asshole. And he has some really awful lines throughout the film (I like being bad. It makes me happy). \n\nBut the biggest problem with Venom is that this films wastes him. He only has like 7-8 minutes of screentime, they chose to show more of Topher's face than Venom's and they kill him at the end. He feels liked a tacked on addition to the film (And he was). \n\nMost of the action in the film is directed really well. It's well shot, intense, and there's no stupid shaky cam that's ruined a lot of action films today. My favorite fight scenes are the Spider-Man Vs Sandman fight in the truck, the Black Suit Spidey Vs Sandman fight in the sewers, and the final fight with New Goblin helping Spider-Man defeat Venom and Sandman (even though some of the green screen effects look a little dated and Venom disappears from the fight until after Sandman is defeated ). The final battle also has a very funny scene where J Jonah Jamason pays a little girl to get her camera to take pictures of the fight, but it turns out film was extra.\n\nAnother problem with the film is Peter and MJ's relationship issues. Not only do Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst have not so great chemistry, The conflict just feels forced and there are some big plotholes in this conflict. Why doesn't MJ tell Peter she got fired from the play? Why did Peter kiss Gwen Stacy in front of MJ as Spider-Man (And why was Gwen Stacy even in this movie? What purpose did she serve?). I will say though that I do like the very end with them dancing together, reconciling, and mourning the loss of Harry.\n\nAnd do I even need to talk about the dancing scenes with Emo Peter Parker twirking and snapping his fingers to jazz music? We all hate them. I wanted to skip those scenes so bad, but I had to rewatch them so I could type this review. Who's idea was this?\n\nOverall, Spider-Man 3 isn't a horrible movie, but it's big let down (Especially when compared to Spider-Man 2). The film has some terrific action, a great score from Christopher Young, a good version of Sandman, mostly good acting (Tobey is good in some scenes and overacts in others), great CGI, and some fantastic scenes. But the film is bogged down by having too much stuff crammed into one film, under using Venom, some plotholes, etc. This movie should've been so much better than it was. I know Sam Raimi wanted to use Vulture (Along with Sandman) instead of Venom, but Sony told him to put him in because of his popularity. That caused the script to get so crowded that they actually considered making the film 2 parts with Vulture and Sandman being in the first part and Venom and New Goblin being in the second one. I wish they actually stuck to that plan.\n\nAnd even though they released an alternate cut of the film last year, there's still a ton footage on the cutting room floor (Some are apparently still in the novelization though) like an alternate meet up between Venom and Sandman, Peter seeing a Venom like creature in the mirror, an extended fight between Venom and New Goblin, etc. I hope one day Sony releases Spider-Man 3.1.\n\nAnd before I give my score, here's my personal ranking of the Spider-Man movies from best to worst.\n\n1. Spider-Man 2\n\n2. The Amazing Spider-Man\n\n3. Spider-Man\n\n4. Spider-Man 3\n\n5. Spider-Man Homecoming\n\n6. The Amazing Spider-Man 2\n\nI give Spider-Man 3 a 3/5.\n\nWhat do you think of Spider-Man 3? Love it? Hate it? Would you like to see an extended cut with all the deleted scenes put back in? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)",

        "text": "Video Form: https://youtu.be/h5jESZGShLU\n\nThe Scorpion and the Frog\nA scorpion asks a frog to carry it across a river.\n“How do I know you won’t sting me?”, asks the frog.\nThe scorpion says, “Because if I do, I will die too.”\nThe frog agrees, but the scorpion stings the frog in midstream.\nBefore both sink and drown, the frog asks, “Why?”\nReplies the scorpion: “It’s in my nature to do so”\n                                                                            - Old Fable -\n \nSpoilers Ahead\nHow do you introduce the main character of your film? You only get one shot at this and how we meet a character can define how we feel about him through the entire film. Just by the opening shot in his apartment we learn so much about the Driver. We’re introduced to him by seeing how he operates and how diligent he is. He’s the one in charge and explains the rules of the game: “You don’t need to know the route. You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window.” In the car we are shown only the perspective of the Driver, as the camera never leaves it. He listens to the same game he was watching in his apartment and manages to escape right on time. A perfect introduction.\n\nBy now we know that the Driver is meticulous, serious and to quick to the point. But when he meets Irene he starts to show some emotion. Something is different about him. Not much later, a few things happen that give us a hint of where the Driver’s thoughts really are. First, when he meets Bernie Rose, a gangster and the movie’s main antagonist, they exchange these lines: “My hands are a little dirty. So are mine.” The Driver has participated in criminal activities, but doesn’t think those actions represent him. His hands are only a “little dirty”. In other words, he thinks of himself as a good person. Bernie, on the other hand, knows he’s a criminal and embraces this.\n\nNext, during Driver’s brief moments of sunshine with Irene and Benicio, we hear the movie’s main theme for the first time: A Real Hero. More on the meaning of the song later, but the importance of the song here is that this is the very first time we see a genuine reason for Driver to change. Irene and Benicio are his motivation to get out of the criminal life. The desire to live a normal life and how distant he feels from that is also apparent in this scene, where Driver sees Irene and her son walking from his apartment window, which is pretty far away.\n\nAn important question appears in his mind. “Is he the bad guy? How can you tell? He’s a shark. There are no good sharks?” Driver is a criminal, a shark. He wants to know if he’s a good one. When he gets the news that Standard, Irene’s husband is returning from prison, he seems troubled. However, when Standard returns home, Irene’s thoughts seem to be elsewhere. “I don’t eat. I don’t sleep. I do nothing but think of you. You got me under your spell.”\n\nHowever, hope is starting to fade for the Driver. He wants out of the shark life, but something is building up inside him. It’s at this point (motel shootout) that he has a moment of truth. He’s a long way from becoming the good guy he wants to be. This is the moment he realizes that this is his life, this is what’s become of him. \n\nThe character we have come to know as efficient, serious and very meticulous is starting to snap.\n\nThis build up of anger inside of him reaches its highest point during the famous elevator scene.\nBefore things get ugly, Driver pushes Irene back, the lights dim, all sounds of the external world fade away and he kisses her in a moment of pure bliss. Or does he? Think about this. This is just a theory, of course, but after Driver realizes the goon has a gun, it’s doubtful he would risk turning his back on him to kiss Irene, putting them both in danger. The dim lights, slow motion and completely shutting out the outside world in a beautiful moment, represent that the kiss is all in Driver’s head and never really happens. Especially since after they kiss, the room goes back to normal. Again, this is just a theory but it’s worth thinking about. After Driver pushes Irene back, he lets it all out on this thug in an extremely violent scene. This is not violence for the sake of violence though, as it serves a purpose on the story. It lets us know how much anger Driver has inside of him and how much he can let out. Irene gets out of the elevator, Driver has a crazy almost savage look on his face and Irene seems like she just understood what type of person he really is. This is the moment, where both of them realize they can never be together.\n\nSo Driver goes after Nino, looking like this (with a mask on). Why? There are two main possibilities here. One, he just doesn't want to get recognized. Two, he’s doing this as the “Real Hero” he wants to be. What is the most identifiable type of hero in western culture? The superhero. Driver wears a costume and terrifies Nino until the very last second before he kills him in the ocean. Perhaps not the most superhero-like story but for Driver, this is the right thing to do in his mind.\n\nTying up loose ends, Driver meets one last time with Bernie at the end of the story. He mentions the fable of the scorpion and the frog. How does that fit into the movie? The Driver is a scorpion, he wants to be a better person, to be with Irene and her son, but can’t escape his troubled life; just like the scorpion couldn’t help stinging the frog and drowning. \n\nThe deal is that Driver gives Bernie the money, and he’ll leave Irene and Benicio in peace. However, Driver knows what type of shark Bernie is, he knows what’s coming. He lets him stab him, but is ready to stab back and kills Bernie. As we wait to see if Driver made it, the theme of the film starts playing in the background. He survives, leaves the money behind and drives off into the night as the Real Hero he always wanted to be.\n\nVideo Form: https://youtu.be/h5jESZGShLU\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7usmsb/kubrick_aspect_ratios/",
        "text": "Anyone who has studied Kubrick knows he cared deeply about aspect ratios. When he filmed 2001 in 2.35, it became a mess when it was pan and scanned down to 4:3 for television (the way most people would end up watching it), losing nearly HALF the original image. So afterwards, he vowed never to shoot at that ratio ever again, which he didn't.\n\n\nA Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon were both 1.66, like Lolita and Paths of Glory before them. Barry Lyndon was changed to 1.78 for the Blu ray, but the new Criterion has since fixed that.\n\nHowever, once we get to Kubrick's final three movies, things become very, VERY difficult.\n\n\nThe Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut were all technically filmed at 1.33 or 4:3, the aspect ratio of television. For the theatrical releases, they were usually 1.85 in America, and 1.66 in Europe. However, on the original home releases, the DVD was 1.33, the full matte. Even more confusing, the Blu Rays were all 1.78, which is pretty much the only aspect ratio we are certain Kubrick DID NOT prefer, as he never released any of his films like that during his life.\n\n\nSome claim that 1.33 looks better, that it's more \"full\", rooms and spaces are larger, characters are smaller. It suits Kubrick's themes, his cold attitude toward his characters, his emphasis on set design and blocking. I personally tend to fall in this category.\n\n\nAt the same time, some shooting scripts of the Shining seem to claim it was meant for 1.85, not 1.66 (or 1.78, which the Blu ray is). I personally don't prefer this aspect ratio, but I can understand why some might feel that way. Especially when you consider the higher bitrate and resolution of the Shining on Blu ray. \n\n\nPersonally, I think some scenes in the Shining look a bit better on Blu ray, but not because of the aspect ratio. The blood elevator scene is particularly improved, much more detail and droplets are visible.\n\n\nHowever, my all time FAVORITE scenes in the movie, the ballroom scene and the bathroom scene with Grady, are definitely better on DVD. Something about seeing the full ceiling of the room, seeing how small Jack looks in it, it's much more powerful.\n\nObviously a 1080p release of the films at 1.33 or 1.66 would be preferable, but for now I'm sticking with my DVDs for his last three movies.\n\n\nBut what do you guys think? Have you personally seen both yet? Tell me your thoughts.",

        "text": "Recently I was watching Rowan Attkinson's take on visual comedy. I literally dumbfounded, since how much the artistic circle gives weight to the relationship between surrealism and comedy as concomitant. I thought this relationship was created by critics to make sense of surrealism. It reminded me why people laughed at *un chien andalou* while  hesitant to laugh at Chaplin. \n\n   Comedy requires surrealism. Surrealism possess comedy. Though it's a labile notion to conclude that they have concomitant relationship between them, since the boundary mostly dependent on the audience reaction itself!\n\nI think, the thin line which separates comedy and surrealism is the area where David Lynch toys us. Most people find hard to distinguish  his works , so people came with a new adjective, \"Lynchian\", but it's merely a combinatorial creativity of these two genres. He superimposes them in Blue Velvet, he adds them in Twin peaks and he subtracts them in Mulholland Drive. This type of artistic sense cannot be attributed wholly to lynch. Kafka mastered this transformation in literature before him.( So that people gave the new name, Kafkaesque?)\n \nComing to Eraserhead , which people mostly consider it as nightmarish fever dream, there are some people think it as outright comedy. Their perception is right. In this film, Lynch borrows the grammar of visual comedy and fuses it with surrealism. The result is nightmarish abstractions for some people and slapstick comedy for others. \n\nThe important quality of Eraserhead is, it doesn't overexpress the comedic quality for gags but subtly undergrounds the surrealism with layers of absurdum.\n\nI think this element made Lynch to shut about his perspective of his work. He does respects the people intentions and likes them to be an element in the art. The manipulation aspect of his movies are not made to play with audience but to make the audience an important aspect in his artwork. He doesn't removes spectators as a trivial element in the art. But he understood thier position  and makes us fall in the element and transform ourself. \n\n\nIf Cinema is a representation of dreams, then Lynch is the master of waking dreams where your personality(comedic) starts to rupture the dream state(surreal). He literally transforms us using ourselves as the medium!!",

It's admittedly a little rough in places, but I'm proud of the overall project. I was fighting the flu and several Benadryl pills while recording voiceover, so sorry if it's a little hard to understand/listen to. This video was meant to serve as a few things, mostly an explanation of what I perceive as the themes of the film, its relation to what I dub cinema of the absurd (basically just theater of the absurd but told through unique filmmaking techniques--I use a few examples of what I think might fall under cinema of the absurd, but it's not exactly an academic term), and a recap of the movie for those who haven't seen it, as only one of the professors judging my work would watch the film (funnily enough, the only film professor on the panel was the one who wanted to watch the movie least). \n\nI'd like to continue discussing *Swiss Army Man*, as it's one of my favorite films, so I hope this sparks a discussion of the film. Since I don't feel comfortable just promoting my own work, please take your time to watch Bobby Burns' [video on transgender themes in Swiss Army Man](https://youtu.be/HHrFVmYRngQ) which served to inspire parts of this.\n\nLooking for some constructive criticism and passioned discussion of the themes, even if everything I say is stupid and off-base. At the very least, I hope that you all check out *Swiss Army Man*, if you haven't seen it already.\n\nEDIT: Awesome, I provided the wrong link. This is off to a great start, eh?",

        "text": "In April 1996, the FBI raided the cabin of one Ted Kaczynski, better known as the “Unabomber”. After decades of mailing pipe bombs to nerds, his reign of terror came to an end. Kaczynski, once a promising Harvard graduate, had turned his back on a society that in his eyes was being degraded by its unhealthy relationship with technology. He had been identified only after he published his manifesto, a long screed against industrial society.\n\nAmong his possessions was a copy of the novelization of Gremlins 2: The New Batch, and several ticket stubs from its run at the local cinema in Lincoln, Montana. It is believed that the film’s depiction of reckless genetic experimentation is what led Kaczynski to target geneticists in the mid-90s. He even, for a time, used the alias “Ted Katheter”, a reference to Christopher Lee’s character in the film.\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch is a cinematic pipe bomb. It’s an explosive commentary on our contemporary relationship with technology. In the decades since its release, many of its parodies have become prophecies.\n\nTo fully examine the relationship between the Gremlins and technology, we must first return to their origins in popular folklore. “Gremlins” first enter the vernacular during WWII, perhaps as a reaction to the increasing role of machinery in warfare. They were creatures that caused aircraft to malfunction. Whimsical saboteurs.\n\nBut what happens when technological thinking is no longer applied solely to machinery? What happens when it is applied to an entire society?\n\nIn the mediocre prequel Gremlins, the monsters are shown to act more in line with the original myth. They sabotage cars, appliances, and most memorably a stair lift. There are also parallels between the Gremlins and Mr. Peltzer’s many useless inventions. Ultimately, the film is a simple moral parable: in irresponsible hands, technology can turn monstrous.\n\nBut what of the sequel?\n\nIn Gremlins 2, we go straight to ground zero, to the shiny chrome heart of post-Cold War technocapital: New York City. But, with the exception of a few establishing shots and the brief inclusion of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the film is really set in a kind of neoliberal no-where place. The sterile concrete of Clamp Center could just as easily be London or San Francisco.\n\nWhat we find is an environment where the newest innovations double as mechanisms of surveillance and control. Rather than changing technology to better accommodate human behavior, we see precisely the opposite. Everything in Clamp Tower must be rationalized, measured, approved: including its employees. Even the plants in the lobby appear to be painted grey. In the words of James Scott:\n\n&gt;“The utopian, immanent, and continually frustrated goal of the modern state is to reduce the chaotic, disorderly, constantly changing social reality beneath it to something more closely resembling the administrative grid of its observations.”\nThis is precisely the same dynamic at work in Clamp Industries.\n\nThe building is not only full of technology, but technological thought. And in the process, everything human is lost. The employees are reduced to barcodes they wear on their lapels — a frightening bit of Holocaust imagery. Yet what frightened people about the Holocaust was not merely its body count, but its bureaucratic approval and ruthless efficiency. This is what separated that particular horror from the horrors of the past. The promise of the Enlightenment — of science, of reason — did nothing to stop the trains to Auschwitz. Just the opposite: it made the machinery of death possible. The databases the Gestapo used were ran by IBM computers.\n\nThe imagery of atrocity is used here to excavate something hidden beneath the glossy exterior of techno-positivity. Clamp Center may be the world’s first “Smart Building”, but the social structures that have been engineered alongside it result in degredation and dehumanization.\n\nAgainst this stand the Gremlins. They are irrational and destructive, but when the forces of creativity and rationality have been made completely subservient to power, those traits can be the very things needed to reclaim autonomy from the jaws of control.\n\nThen, of course, there is the Splice-O-Life lab. Technology has brought capital to its final frontier: the body. But we are given a choice: horror or liberation. We see the horror in the form of the Vegetable Gremlin. Here we have the logic of capital taken to its cannibalistic endpoint. While bodies have always been worn out in the name of capital, it is only in recent years that we have seen the rise of black market organ trading, or the formation of a legal market for plasma (driven by vampiric Silicon Valley robber-barons).\n\nWhen capital looks at a forest, it sees lumber. When it looks at a mountain it sees a potential source of metal or minerals. When it looks at a human, it sees an economic node, a source of labor. Or rather, it used to. With the advent of automation, capital’s relation to the humanity is changing. How does capital see “excess” humanity? In this new era, the body is no longer a car to drive, but one to break down to its component parts. Such a change has already happened in animals, who went from beings who labored and produced, to objects for consumption. This is the body horror of the Vegetable Gremlin, a visage of what awaits man in the chop shop of technocapital.\n\nAnd yet, we also have the wonders of the Bat Gremlin, or the Spider Gremlin. While both meet gruesome deaths, their short lives are brimming with vitality. They are the Gremlin liberated, the anti-Vegetable Gremlin. They turn the weapons of capital against itself. There is the old socialist phrase, “ The last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope.” Let us update this: “The last capitalist to be ensnared in our web will be the one who sold us the Spider DNA”.\n\nThat is where Joe Dante succeeds, and Ted Kaczynski fails. Technology in itself is ambiguous, its the mindset behind the technology that can be either authoritarian or liberatory. Dante has turned the Hollywood sequel into a radical Trojan Horse. Like the Gremlins in Gremlins 2: The New Batch, he has turned a tool of domination into a tool for liberation.",

I haven't watched a lot of Ingmar Bergman's films, but I was very impressed by \"Skammen\". I loved its cinematography and the relationship between Jan and Eva. Even though \"Skammen\" was a sad movie, it was beautiful and oddly touching, and the ending moved me. \n\nHowever, I feel like \"Skammen\" is underrated. On Rate Your Music, for example, it has an average rating of a 3.82/5.0, and it has 600+ ratings and 8 reviews. Also, \"Skammen\" isn't as popular and/or acclaimed as Ingmar Bergman's other movies on Rate Your Music, and it has a 73% on Rotten Tomatoes. Also, it has 9,000+ ratings on IMDb, which is rather miniscule in comparison to the popularity that \"The Avengers\", \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", \"Spider-Man\" (2002), etc. receive on IMDb. \n\nOverall, I believe that \"Skammen\" is a fantastic, but overlooked film that doesn't always get the attention that it deserves. Do you guys agree with me, about this? ",

        "text": "Hey y'all,\n\nSo last night I decided to watch Argo again with my girlfriend, it is my favorite movie of all time and I see now why it's my favorite movie.\n\nThe movie does a really good job at foreshadowing and build up. From finding the shredded pieces of documents to how the locals react to just seeing a Caucasian in the street. It shows you the tension they all feel and how the political environment was back in the day between the US and Iran.\n\nAt first I use to complain that Ben Affleck's character was bland and not really that interesting. After a few viewing, I see that he's just a serious man and that it was needed for this kind of situation. And the Airport scene by far is one of the most suspenseful scenes in cinema I have ever seen. Mainly because we've seen throughout the film what will happen to them if they get caught, so you know just ONE mistake and they're done.\n\nTruly the ending does feel well earned. With how everything ties up, it doesn't feel forced or \"oh we have to let everyone know that they're okay\" but they actually show you a miracle after a mission on what seemed impossible at that start.\n\nI guess a flaw from the film would be they do paint it a little one-sided, but having lived in a country where they all wanted one man dead and so much corruption, I feel like their reaction is justified for the film.\n\nOverall, what are your thoughts on the film??",

        "text": "I just watched the whole trilogy through for the first time.  I thought the first two were pretty great films.  And then I watched the third one and was just left scratching my head.  \n\nThe second one ends with Michael's demise as he becomes more megalomaniacal, paranoid, and spiteful.  He ends up pushing away the family that he convinced himself he was protecting.  He even murdered the only brother who respected his desire for independence in cold blood.  That last flashback really got me, and was the best scene of the whole trilogy in my mind.   \n\nThen I watched the third one.  And was very confused after. \n\n I thought what they did with Michael and Kaye's character was actually really interesting and seemed like that's where the story would naturally go.  Towards Michael's redemption and realization that his aspirations were born out of delusion.  But it seems like the movie didn't focus too much on this at all.  And only scratched the surface.  But, I thought this aspect of the movie was really good.  \n\nThe rest...  I really didn't care for.  The weird incestuous relationship between Vincent and Mary felt like I was watching a soap opera.  It was so out of place with the rest of the trilogy.  \n\nThe effort to make organized crime seem cool was a bit more forced in this one, very awkward, and kind of jarring with the themes of the last movie.  I felt like the action/murder scenes in towards the end of the godfather and throughout part 2 grew more distasteful throughout Michael Corleone's story.  I felt like that was supposed to be intentional. \n\nBut in this movie I sometimes felt like I was watching an action movie that could have had Arnold Schwarzenegger in there somewhere.  Choppers with machine guns?  A chase on horseback through a NYC parade?  This doesn't match the tone of the first two movies at all in my mind. And it was completely jarring to me.  \n\nIt also felt like the cast was split between great actors and really bad ones.   I didn't really care about Eli Wallach's character at all, or the plot involving the Vatican.  \n\nIt felt so out of place.  \n\nThe first two godfathers feel like two halves of one story.  This one just felt like a completley different movie altogether that sort of had the epilogue of the first two movies sprinkled in.  \n\nThat's my thoughts anyway.  Curious to know what others thought.  I actually stayed away from this one for a while because I heard it was terrible, and while I didn't like it.  I didn't think it was a bad movie overall.  But i wouldn't say it was good either ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7u5aqu/a_random_selection_and_celebration_of_some_of_the/",
        "text": "Like many here I'm sure, I find myself watching a large portion of my film viewership with my better half. Often, I don't think I can, nor would want to, force her to submit to watching something by Haneke, Teshigahara, Zulawski, etc, and funny enough the middle ground we often end up in is B-movies and genre flicks. While critics often turn their nose up at such affair, or lack knowledge of it, these films are often fantastic in their own right. Such films are great for late night viewing when something more mentally taxing is off-putting, and these films while immensely watchable can still have a point and give you enough to chew on for a conversation afterwards. So in discussing this I'm hoping to signpost some of you in some good couples viewing, and hopefully you'll have some suggestions. Also, it is nice to give some recognition to an enormous, but often looked down upon, area of filmmaking culture - I'd happily watch Starship Troopers 1000 more times before I'll watch bloody Darkest Hour.\n\nAnyway, here are a few I've found particularly good viewing:\n\n**Daybreakers** - The cast is absolutely fantastic which gives me the confidence those behind this project really knew what they were doing. Ethan Hawke is one of my favourite actors, and really tries to do something worthwhile with a vampire genre-flick that is on paper ridiculous, and Sam Neill is absolutely fantastic as the corporate vampire overlord (has there ever been as fitting a part for him). It's bloody as all hell, filmed excellently, and even if you might think the themes of exploitation and corporate greed are a bit r/im14andthisisdeep it provides enough structure to make the story a suitable vehicle for the action to take place.\n\n**Pandorum** - One on this list I might get the most resistance to since this film bombed critically (27 or so on Metacritic), however, I am convinced this film is excellent. Ben Foster goes all in and gives a very physically exerting performance, he really seems to want to sell to film, when I'm sure it would have been easy to phone it in on a bit of B-movie schlock. The amount of twists are quite farcical by the end, but the quality of the filmmaking is excellent. How you film your reverses is a great indicator of a director's competence, the filming of a scene between two characters around the end of the first act made me declare in my head 'fuck what critics think they know, this is filmed intelligently and has a hell of a lot to offer'. Ironically, one of the producers is Paul W.S. Anderson, and this is the kind of genre film he wishes he was half as good enough to make.\n\n**Blade II** - Guillermo del Toro isn't above getting into a bit of B-movie silliness, and with him at the helm this is a vampire action film which is directed exceptionally well. It has Ron Perlman as a neo-Nazi vampire gimp, is that not enough?\n\n**Yakuza Apocalypse** - In case anyone here isn't familiar with Takashi Miike this is one to see. Properly hilarious with a great sense of how to use slapstick to full effect, while also being full of action and a special kind of utter madness of which Miike is a king. \n\n**Ravenous** - Guy Pearce stars in a less talked about bit of cannibal nonsense, but everyone involved seems totally on board with it, especially Robert Carlyle who is properly chewing the scenery every chance he gets. The premise is utterly insane - eating people gives you superpowers, but no one knows - makes this a very fun one.  \n\n**Train to Busan** - A great melding of two genre flick archetypes - the confined space film, and the zombie outbreak film. As with many genre flicks, it carries a bit of a morality fable theme to it to give you more to reflect on than the unstoppable zombie horde. Very fun film. \n\n**Bone Tomahawk** - Bare-bones western with a brilliantly straightforward premise - troglodytes have kidnapped people, we need to go get them. Truly one of the most brutal films I've seen, every character is drawn clearly and acted well. I saw this in the cinema on my own on a whim when it came out, I was blown away by how good it was. \n\n**Raw** - Julia Ducournau has explicitly mentioned intentionally using the conventions of the 'body horror' genre in this film so whilst it is very much on the art-film side of genre flicks I'll include it here, not least because I think it's outstanding. Someone asked me the other week my favourite film of last year and this was it. It is a brilliant, epic, coming of age tail that manages to be shocking, funny, sad, relatable, and the genre film at it's absolute peak.\n\nSome I've been less interested in just to generate some further discussion:\n\n**30 Days of Night** - Interesting set up, but perhaps could have done with being a bit sillier, the whole thing ended up feeling rather dour and serious. Ben Foster is back and is giving it all he can, but the film refuses to use him almost at all.\n\n**Green Room** - Got a lot of praise, but I felt the film didn't really go for any Panic Room type tension, even though the film is set up as a one-location film it really isn't. The way the film happily throws away characters with no payoff is a little annoying, even for a genre film.",

        "text": "[Video Review + My question for Zvyagintsev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4j62TI4izg)\n\nI saw Loveless on Sunday night at the Irish Film Institute in Dublin in front of a packed audience, the screening was followed by a Q&amp;A with director Andrey Zvyagintsev &amp; producer Alexander Rodnyansky. Check out the end of the video to hear more on that. \n\nLoveless is directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev who made the oscar nominated Leviathan as well as The Banishment and The Return. \n\nThe film follows an estranged Russian couple, Zhenya &amp; Boris who, going through a bitter divorce, neglect to pay attention to their shy son Alexei.\n\nThe film, much like it’s predecessor, Leviathan is a stunning drama brought to heights of a thriller by assured direction and an intense, riveting screenplay. In this way it calls to mind the work of Nuri Bilge Ceylan (Winter Sleep &amp; Once Upon A Time in Anatolia) and Asghar Farhadi (A Separation &amp; The Salesman). That being said, Zvyagintsev is in a league of his own. Loveless pulls you in with a gripping score, stunning cinematography and fantastic performances by the dedicated cast. \n\nThe film has no fat, which only adds to its intensity. Every shot has been expertly composed to tell the required story without the need for pointless cutaways or close ups. It’s a perfect example of visual storytelling. Though the dialogue is used to devastating effect, the mean-spirited arguments of Zhenya &amp; Boris are biting and heartbreaking in their frankness, the film never over uses dialogue. Much like it’s pitch perfect shot choice, the dialogue is used only when it informs story and character. \n\nOne scene in particular towards the climax of the film took my breath away. Though it’s a simple two shot with Zhenya and Boris observing something below frame, the performances on screen by Maryana Spivak and Aleksey Rozin as well as the keen eyed direction overseeing them create a rollercoaster of emotions in a short span of two minutes. It’s a beautifully realised moment, the culmination of the film’s tension and the characters refusal to accept a possibly harsh truth. Zvyagintsev knows exactly how long to let a scene linger, he is a master of atmosphere and deeply humanistic in portraying his characters regardless of how seemingly distasteful they may seem as human beings.  \n\nMany have read political sentiments into the film and, being set between the years of 2012-2015 at the height of the Ukrainian crisis, it certainly has a lot to say about the current problems at the heart of Putin’s Russia. However, at its core, the film is utterly universal in its depiction of heartlessness, the selfish nature of humans and how these attributes can be passed down from generation to generation. \n\nLoveless speaks to profound themes on family, childhood, society, religion and personal responsibility without ever losing sight of the story at its core. The film is utterly deserving of its best foreign language film oscar nomination and would be a worthy winner.  \n\nI’m going to give Loveless 5 stars out of 5.\n\n**What did you think of Loveless? I'd love to discuss it in-depth and get into spoiler territory.**\n\n[Video Review + My question for Zvyagintsev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4j62TI4izg)",

        "author": "SurreptitiousLunatic",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7tzwr6/why_the_shape_of_water_particularly_got_to_me/",
        "text": "OK, so there are probably plenty of this kind of post about this film already, since it was released in other countries a while before it was released here in New Zealand where I live. I’m normally very introverted even on the internet and don’t make many posts or comments, but for once I don’t care. I just want to get my opinion out there and explain just why, while it’s already receiving plenty of critical acclaim, seeing The Shape of Water had such an effect on me personally, having seen it precisely once at the time of writing.\n\nTo start off, I’ve not been able to properly relate to many characters in any media, but I was able to connect with Elisa in a way I never have before. I myself am high-functioning autistic and didn’t become properly verbal until I was about 6. Even now at the age of 20, I can only hope to be articulate if I have a coherent script in my head of what I’m going to say. That combined with intense introversion and occasional shyness (no, they’re not the same thing) means I frequently choke on my words/find myself unable to say what I want to say, especially important - to that end, because I’m lucky enough to be hyperlexic (a sort of splinter condition that causes precocious reading and writing ability as well as an obsession with letters and numbers in some cases), I rely on the written word for more heavy communication. I’ve come to be proud of who I am over time, but only after learning to take my periods of trial and error and other people’s prejudice and misunderstandings in my stride. Yeh the worst of childhood and teenage bullying might be behind me, but I still deal with subtle and not-so-subtle prejudice and patronisation, so almost immediately as I was watching The Shape of Water, I could understand those little bits of Elisa’s life that add up and isolate her, no matter how used to it she might be.\n\nI don’t know how Guillermo del Toro did it, and I’m sure others who liked this film are still bewildered as well, but somehow he managed to make me completely buy the relationship between Elisa and the creature. It’s probably got a lot to do with the fact that as far as I could tell, he’s actually there, played by a guy in makeup and prosthetics, not by CGI. Of course another key reason why that is is because the creature is voiceless, just like her. I mean voiceless in the purely physical sense - written and other visual methods of communication like sign language are just as valid as forms of one’s voice, and preferring or needing to use those instead of speaking shouldn’t be seen as something to be marginalised or pitied - but I digress. I totally bought the bond Elisa formed with the creature because for once, I could 100% see myself bonding with another person; the fact that I’m not good at talking effectively on the fly didn’t get in the way of my investing in the situation for once.\n\nAnd my God, when Elisa is frantically trying to get across to her neighbour Giles why she needs his help to save the creature - why and how she has such a connection to someone/something that’s as out of place in the film’s world as she is - I genuinely wept for her and understood why this was so important to her, because for once I’ve actually been there, unable to articulate myself how I feel and unable to make anyone understand why it’s so hard for me to say as much about something as I’d like to or why it’s so important to me, because most people just don’t and won’t understand. I’ve only been able to do that for a tiny handful of characters in any story, in a film or otherwise. The same goes for the scene later when we go into her imagination, where Elisa is singing her heart out, putting everything into manifesting how she’s feeling and why, and it’s all in her mind. It’s like scene in The Fisher King in Grand Central Station, where Perry sees Lydia and the whole atrium starts waltzing around, and it’s a brief, elaborate taste of what’s whirling around in Perry’s imagination. The song’s lyrics are a perfect fit - the creature never will know through spoken words how much she loves him, because her voice is loudest in her mind. I know I’ve been there countless of times - I can articulate all I’m thinking in my head, but there’s a bottleneck between my mind and my mouth and I can only say so much before I feel too shy and need to retreat, or before I slip up or look out of place to other people.\n\nAnd for once, FINALLY, there’s no on-the-nose, self-righteous, patronising bullshit from any of the characters (except the villain) about how Elisa needs to be “fixed” or to want to fit in. She’s not peer-pressured or guilt tripped or humiliated into wanting to be anyone or anything other than her true self. She tackles covert prejudice everyday, but she takes it in her stride and doesn’t let it crush her; she’s just focused on trying to find what satisfies her and her alone, what gives *her* a sense of satisfaction, an anchor in the big chaotic sea called life. Sure she ultimately finds that anchor in the form of a romance, but I can let that slide this time because it’s supposed to be a fairy tale, dammit. Alexandre Despot’s timeless score and the wonderful sets and colours that remind me of The City of Lost Children only cement the feeling of the film as a fairy tale, a story that could take place in any era, anywhere within the same skeleton.\n\nThat being said though, because the film’s story is assembled quite simply à la fables or other classic tales, I acknowledge that there are some big missed opportunities that would’ve made it more complex and perhaps more interesting. A big hole that could do with more exposition to fill it is the villain - what motivations does he have for behaving the way he does, apart from that extracting whatever-it-is (is it ever explicitly stated what they wanted to extract?) form the creature will bring in the big bucks? What’s his backstory? What’s he going through? I mean, his suburban life and family are so cookie-cutter and unlike him that surely there’s some reason why they contrast so much. Why are his house and his wife’s clothes yellow? It’s obvious he’s not satisfied with something in his home life - why not? I’d really like to know!\n\nOn a similar vein, there was a great chance that Del Toro seems to have missed to develop the theme of isolation and how we’re so often marginalised by others for being different. I appreciate that it was subtle during the main narrative thread with Elisa, but with her neighbour’s subplot of him having nobody else to rely on only seemed to be touched on tentatively with the publisher and the guy in the pie shop discriminating both him for his advances as well as the black couple who try and sit down there. It’s actually too subtle and just kind of crops up to give us breaks from Elisa; I think that subplot really would have benefited and maybe even strengthened the film if it’s been more effectively woven into the story with more time to breathe and establish the theme properly. The same goes for Elisa’s friend Zelda - her backstory with her abusive husband is so subtle as to practically pop up out of nowhere during the third act and would have had way more of an impact if it had more time (without cutting down on Elisa’s narrative) for us to absorb it, like Giles’ subplot.\n\nOtherwise, I’ve no other problems with this film, none of the usual trouble I have suspending my disbelief or being bothered about the characters. It got me in a place that very few films or other stories have managed to do only partially. I was latched to The Shape of Water from beginning to end and have no regrets naming it one of my top 3 favourite films of all time.",

He told me in the early 80's he was dating this one girl whose best friends were way deep in the art scene and even though her friends were very different from him, he decided to compromise and hang out with them. They took him to see a French film and it was terrible.\n\nWhat he told me about the film:\n- Late 70's/ early 80's. \n- Although it was a french film, people did not speak any languages, rather they barked and growled at each other for 90 minutes.\n\nSince he was not into it from the start and this happened so many years ago, that's all I have to go by. I know it isn't much, but I don't think there are too many French pictures people are barking at each other for 90 minutes. \n\nI tried to google it, but I couldn't find anything. I want to find it so I can watch it to see if it's really as bad as he says it is. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7tubuy/citizen_kane_reviewed_by_erich_von_stroheim/",
        "text": "**i Just happened upon this very interesting review Erich von Stroheim (a great influence on Welles, Orson Welles lists Greed as one of his ten favorite films) did on Citizen Kane. He critiques the film's structure and story but praises the cinematography even going so far as to say '\"Citizen Kane\" is a great picture and will go down in screen history. More power to Welles!'.**\n\n\n\nThis is perhaps the first criticism of a film ever written by a film-maker who coincidentally also in his time — like Orson Welles — played the \"Holy Trinity.\" In our case \"Trinity\" means that the functions of the Writer, Director, and Star are combined in one person. The man executing these three functions in any case has a gigantic job on his hands which can only be fully appreciated by someone who actually has attempted the same. In fact, Orson Welles went me one better as he was also the Producer. And the Producer Welles permitted without grumbling the Director Welles to execute what the Writer Welles had planned to do. And Director Welles allowed the Actor Welles to do as he pleased.\n\nAs the man who plays the \"Super. Trinity\" earns the applause practically alone — provided the finished product is a worthy one — so must he solely take the blame should one or more of his endeavors not have functioned properly.\n\nIn the case of \"Citizen Kane,\" Welles had to take the blame for the malfunctioning of the \"story\" and Herman G. Mankiewicz may take a goodly share of it for himself. If Mankiewicz wrote the original screen-play as the program announces, then Welles is to blame for not demanding changes and supplementary scenes as well as the omission of existing repetitious ones. If his objections were overruled, he deserves the blame nevertheless for not insisting on those changes. In the souvenir program we are told that Welles \"shot\" for one week or so \"wild,\" meaning without script. One cannot direct from the \"cuff\" any longer and perhaps that has something to do with the evident shortcomings of the continuity.\n\nTo criticize that film justly is a tough job. Usually, most of the critics simply state their opinion that a film is good, bad or indifferent, but they have not specific knowledge of what makes a film good or bad. It may be the story or only the continuity that is wrong. It may be the direction or the acting. Many times the director gets the blame for a bad story or continuity, although he had nothing to do with them, but had done the best anyone could have done with the material at hand. Actors are blamed for a bad performance when in fact they only did what they were ordered to do by their director. Although Welles did all these things himself, in criticizing his work one must specify in which be has failed.\n\nI shall start (contrary to Welles's technic) at the beginning with the basic element of a film — the story. As a story proper \"Citizen Kane\" has much to criticize. It is neither big nor vital enough to justify the tremendous outlay of work, time and money which can easily be recognized even by a layman. It is just another story of an over-ambitious man; in this particular case a newspaper publisher, who incidentally aspires to become governor. A man who has built a vast newspaper empire only to see it crumble. A man who collects anything and everything from the four corners of the globe without being in the slightest interested in anything be collects. A man who deserts his wife and child only to be deserted in the end by the woman for whom be deserted. In a way he has ideals at the start, but he has not the necessary character to live up to them. Citizen Kane really cares for three things only; Kane, KANE and K A N E!\n\nThere is nothing particularly new in all that. It has happened thousands of times in real life, and it has been filmed many times. And the same mistake made in previous films has been repeated. The laboratory analysis — under the microscope — of Citizen Kane's heart and soul has been forgotten.\n\nNo man is so utterly selfish and hardboiled that one cannot find some redeeming feature in his motivations, his actions and reactions. Except for the singularly beautiful incident of \"Rosebud,\" the name of his boyhood sleigh which he utters as he dies, there is not one touch in the film that would tend to make Kane human and understandable. To make a man's insatiable ambition, his cruel selfishness and his ruthlessness really understandable and interesting, one should have visual reasons for his having developed into such a monster.\n\nTo be truthful, during the first twenty minutes of viewing the film, I, who have been thirty years in this business of making films, did not know what it was all about. I may be dumb, but I have asked at least fifty people who in more or less articulate form described the same experience. I may be hyper-conservative or just plain old fashioned, but I believe in all sincerity that the form of telling the story of Citizen Kane is not the desired or successful form in which to tell a screen story. All of us have been accustomed to hear or to see a story start at the beginning. Welles's way of telling the story may have its place in a novel or on the stage, but I am convinced that in the cinema it is entirely out of place.\n\nOf course I understand that Kane having been a newspaper publisher, Welles treated his death from a newspaper angle in short staccato flashes. I do not object to that, but I do object to his beginning with Kane's death. Far be it from me to rewrite the story but I do believe that the story might have been so arranged that Kane's death could have been shown in the old traditional way — at the end. Its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs the film of its general entertainment value. Aside from this criticism of the shortcomings of the story and the radical departures in telling same, I have nothing but the highest praise for the film. The production as a whole can only be classified as superb. The direction — and may I say here that only the initiated will ever understand bow much work and responsibility \"direction\" embraces-is masterful; except for allowing Erskin Sandford to look like a character out of Dickens.\n\nAside from Welles himself, the laurels for acting go to Everest Sloane as \"Bernstein\" who is magnificent in his human simplicity, Joseph Cotton as \"Jedediah Leland\" is excellent, except for the military white \"mustache\" the make-up man was permitted to paste on his upper-lip in the sanatorium scene. He looks more like a sergeant of artillery in the old soldiers' home than the idealist he was supposed to portray. Ruth Warrick as the wife gives as \"wifely\" a performance as may be desired in order to justify somewhat her husband leaving her. Dorothy Comingore as the \"singer\" sweetheart is very good and in several scenes quite touching in her vulgarity. The rest of the cast, all of which are Mercury players, none of whom I have ever seen on the screen before, give splendid performances. The sets of Van Nest Polglase never distract. The castle sets are magnificent, and so realistic that at times I wondered whether they had really been constructed for the film, or Hearst's castle at Saint Simon had actually been used. The lighting and the photography deserve the highest praise. They prove my contention of long ago that even in sound films we can achieve artistic and beautiful photography assisting and accentuating the drama, which since the advent of sound has been so shamefully neglected. Naturally there are some ignorami (including some film critics) who have called this photography shadowy and spooky. The trouble is that they have been so over-fed with lousy photography since the silent films went out that they have come to believe photography has to be lousy. My high hat off and a very deep bow to Gregg Toland and Vernon L. Walker, A.S.C. The sound in this film is as sound should be.\n\nThe \"stink\" raised by Louella Parsons all over the country about \"Citizen Kane\" supposedly being the more or less authentic life-history of Citizen William Randolf Hearst and his supposed objection to having the film shown, the supposed attempt of certain Hollywood producers to chip in large sums of money to repay R.K.O. if they would refrain from releasing the film, the supposed objections raised and restrictions imposed by the Hays office . . . to me is a decidedly \"fishy\" one. Much more do I, and many others with whom I have talked, believe that this was a very clever advertising scheme that came out of the fertile brain of Citizen Welles who, in my opinion, would make as great a director of publicity as he has proven himself to be a director in the film. Whatever the truth may be about it, \"Citizen Kane\" is a great picture and will go down in screen history. More power to Welles!\n\nhttp://www.fredcamper.com/M/VonStroheim.html",

He is commanding officer of the paramilitary sent to Algeria to quell the FLN, a counterpoint to the focus of Ali La Pointe of the FLN. A large part of the movie focuses on him outsmarting the group.\n\nSomething strikes me about the depiction of the colonel, from the looks to his personality. Based on appearance alone, he looks like a badass hero that you typically find in an 80s action movie, with him constantly wearing shades and his physique. He commands every scene he's in, showing absolute control to both his soldiers and the reporters who surround him. Personality-wise, he is a no-nonsense guy who gets the job done by any means necessary while still being witty, also something you find in action movies.\n\nIt feels like the movie is trying to portray him as some of tough-guy hero that young boys look up to. In a way, you find yourself siding with him just based on his effectiveness at handling the situation at hand. It's almost like the French romanticized while they commit the brutal acts.

        "text": "The Matrix is a hero's journey, not unlike Star Wars, even with wildly different worlds:\n\n1. Neo, a programmer in a boring role, receives a mysterious message on his computer, a call to adventure.\n2. But wait! When Morpheus calls him on his phone as the agents approach him, he refuses to make the leap of faith. The agents capture him.\n3. Neo meets this godlike figure with a mythical image: Morpheus. He is convinced. He ventures into the real world, and meets the people in the Nebuchadnezzar.\n5. A testing period - he runs through training programs and fails, learning and understanding the rules of the Matrix, and what it means to be in a simulation.\n6. I think this is called meeting with the goddess? He meets the Oracle, and maybe they subverted the standard meeting since this feels so ordinary. Good cookies.\n7. Thanks to a sabotage by Cypher, Morpheus is captured by the Agents. Neo must head back to save him. When he approaches the Agents, particularly Smith, he realizes how strong he can truly be.\n8. In the showdown in the metro, he runs away from Smith at first, but then turns back to face them. Smith kills him, but he is miraculously resurrected (well, Carrie Anne Moss kisses him if that counts).\n9. Neo destroys Smith, and he is now truly The One, unlocking how powerful he can be, as he flies off into the screen.\n\nI still can't imagine how incredible it must have been to see that last shot in 1999. To this day this is one of the few films that keeps thrilling me every time I see it, no matter the plot holes. Neo flies off, now a deity in his own right, and... *then what?*\n\nThen two sequels in 2003 arrive, but I'm a lot more interested in the first, because there's not many decent movies that discuss in depth about the aftermath of the hero's journey.\n\nI get how the Wachowskis are hung up on determinism in Reloaded, but isn't that the logical continuation of a journey like this? Heavy-handed as many scenes in the sequel are, there are some interesting mirrors I find to the standard hero's journey. Seems to an extent that the Wachowskis even question it: \n\n- Suddenly, Smith too experiences a resurrection, not unlike Neo in the first movie. Where's his purpose though? Now *he's* just as confused as Neo was when he entered this new world, except Smith now enters the same old world as a free program. He's right in that they have a connection, both of them seemed to have gamed the system they escaped. Of course, this time around Neo has a few tests as well which make for some breathtaking action scenes, but it's almost too easy for him now.\n\n- Neo meeting all these mythical figures this time around. It's not just the Oracle, who presented him with a tough prediction the first time around that turned out to be false. Now he finds out she's part of the system he escaped, and it's now his choice whether he trusts her. He meets the Merovingian, a borderline-omniscient trafficker of information who ends up asking why he came to him in the first place, as if he looked at the conveyor-belt Hero's Journey that Neo was on. Is there a reason for the hero to get the magical sword or talisman aside from the fact that it's just the next step in the journey?\n\n- He heads back to rescue Trinity who was caught in her mission, not unlike how he rescued Morpheus in The Matrix, except *he saw this* in the beginning, and that vision might have in some way or another even motivated him to arrive at this moment, as if he's in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n- He meets the Architect, the guy who created the Matrix, who tells him using Roget's Thesaurus that the climax has happened five times already, and tells him about his choice. He fails to save the many ships that crash because he went to save Trinity instead, but yet he unlocks a whole new level of power by being able to control the machines with his mind.\n\nEven if the action scenes are absolutely top-notch, there's no doubt that the Wachowskis got a little ahead of themselves when trying to deliver all their points to the audience, leading to characters that got a bit Flanderized as a result. Still, this strikes me as a rare and somewhat seldom-attempted look back at the hero's journey that the protagonist took, as if going through a very similar journey displays how futile choice is.",

        "text": "Virtù and Fortuna are two philosofical ideas that were very recurrent in western philosophy in the Modern Age, especially in the works of Machiavelli, The Prince being his most famous work and one of classics from Philosophy as a whole.\n\nMachiavelli was an Italian philosopher from 16th Century. His work is marked by his political and philosophical cynicism, because he was the first who separated politics from ethics, which differs him from other thinkers like Aristotle. Some people consider him the first nihilist (for obvious reasons). His work is considered as the beginning of Political Science. To Machiavelli, what makes a good king/leader/administrator is not his ethical and moral essence, is not divine legality, but how smart the person of power is to maintain his own power, regardless the means for that. The ends justify the means. Ethics cannot be a goal to the king, but a tool. And one of the arguments that Machiavelli uses to justify his position is the difference between two concepts: virtù and fortuna. But what is virtù and fortuna?\n\nFortuna (or fortune) is simply luck, and how the contingency of life can help us sometimes. If you are from a noble family is an example of that, because you didn't needed to do anything to have what you have. But, to Machiavelli, Fortuna is not enough, because you can have Fortuna but maybe you don't have the Virtù.\n\nVirtù is your power and/or will to produce, and with that maintain your own life. Similar ideas of virtù would be used later by philosophers like Max Stirner with his philosophical egoism and Nietzsche with his Will to Power.\n\nWhen we think about examples from Pop Culture of typical Machiavellian ideas, we normally think about movies like The Godfather Trilogy or TV series like Game Of Thrones and House of Cards. But a movie like Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will be Blood is a perfect example of the difference between these two concepts, even if is not necessarily about politics or the war between gangsters. \n\nVirtù and Fortuna are perfectly symbolized in the duality between the two main characters: Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday (played by Paul Dano).\n\nDaniel Plainview is the embodiment of the concept of Virtù. Everything that he has comes from everything that he did to obtain it. His life is a competition with other people, he don't like others to succeed. He do anything for his own selfish reasons, like adopt his son H.W or accept being baptized. For Machiavelli, Stirner and Nietzsche, Plainview is worthy of his power.\n\nIn the other hand, characters like H.W and Eli represents Fortuna. H.W having luck for being adopted by a powerful man and Eli using divine legality to maintain himself in the position of power and influence where he is. For Machiavelli, Stirner and Nietzsche, Eli is not worthy of his power.\n\nPlainview's retribution against Eli at the end of the movie almost represents the death of falses legalities like, according to Daniel, the religious one and the rise of this Übermensch, this new man of a new era, where power is not a tool to ethics anymore, but ethics is a just a tool to power. Just like what Daniel says, he is the Third Revelation now.",

        "text": "I just want to make it clear up front that this isn't meant to be an analysis of either film, just my personal experience in trying to reconcile what I see as great filmmaking with my experiences watching these movies. Very, very light spoilers for The Hunt.\n\nI just watched The Student and found myself in a very similar position to when I watched The Hunt. The Student follows a troublesome teenager's sudden foray into religion. He is regularly at odds with a teacher who tries to teach material that conflicts with his ideology, such as a condom demonstration in sex ed and evolution. He actively disrupts these discussions and is very unwilling to budge even an inch in how strongly he holds his beliefs or how he goes about conveying them.\n\nWhat bothered me so much while watching is how none of the staff members seem to care about how he's disrupting the classes (by totally bringing them to a stop), but just that the teacher should be more open to including points of view that support his religious ideas. The teacher is very science-minded, so the idea of formally teaching about creationism or not informing students on the use of condoms seems ridiculous to her. I found myself very sympathetic to her not only due to shared values, but also because it seems totally beyond the administration to reprimand the student for disrupting the class in a way that would naturally result in some sort of punishment.\n\nI had a similar feeling about Mads Mikkelsen's character in The Hunt. It's been a little while since I've seen it, but I can't remember his character ever outright denying the claims against him. He asks other people if they think he did it, but he never defends himself. I would think that if very serious accusations were made against you that you were innocent of, you wouldn't take them lying down. Even though trying to defend himself may not have changed the outcome of the movie, it's frustrating to witness innocence only for the accused party to never try to assert that innocence.\n\nHowever, it's hard to deny that skill and talent that went into both of these movies. The messages The Student conveys, along with some thoughts about the current state of the Russian politics and its school system, are things I found interesting (although, full disclosure, I only found out about the political subtext after I started looking at some reviews). The performances in both of these movies are engaging, and the stories are really captivating. The long takes in The Student are highly impressive. Despite these achievements, I think it's difficult to reconcile how I feel towards the characters and how they behave with the effort I see that was put into these films and other movies like them. It's definitely a testament to the movies for me to feel so strongly about them.\n\nI definitely don't think we should put aside our gut reactions just because a movie is well-made, but I'm wondering how other people approach similar feelings. How do you respond to characters like these?",

And he nails it, with help of the stunning, meticulously framed cinematography by Elisha Christian.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Gv5hHgM.gif\n\nColumbus, Indiana is the backdrop to the story that positions a daughter giving up her career to care for her mother, and a son who was neglected in favour of a career by his father. Symbolism, symmetry and architecture provide the metaphors for the messages and themes, and I took them mostly to mean that some of us strive to align symmetry to our lives but the reality is that we can all achieve balance - even when things are off kilter.\n\nAs an Asian film-maker, Kogonada has clearly been influenced by Kim Ki-Duk and Takeshi Kitano ('Time' and' Kikujiro' are similar in tone) and also the one point perspective techniques of Kubrick. The result here, is a phenomenally beautiful movie that trickles along nicely as we meet a male - female dynamic that share their troubles and end up trying to figure out how to move on to the next chapter of their lives. Haley Lu Richardson and John Cho are a great combo, and the former especially gives a pretty amazing turn well beyond her years.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lmmw4fv.gif\n\nThink Asian cinema blended in with stunning photography, and perhaps a hint of Jim Jarmusch's 'Paterson' and it's about where this movie is. There's also a hint of the before / after trilogy in the dialogue.\n\nThose who appreciate aesthetics will enjoy this movie. Those who prefer more of an adrenaline rush will want to avoid it.\n\n8 / 10",

This person accuse one commenter on being pretentious for defending mother! and said that \"Beyond entertainment, movies are of little to no importance in real life. People simply movies for couple hours of escapist fun.\" I told him that there's people out are who do finding in film. The response: \"Movies are not about ''art'', they're only about entertainment. I'll repeat myself, beyond entertainment movies are of little to no value in real life. Millions and millions of people the world over love watching blockbusters can't be wrong.\"\n\n\"You're just a typical delusional idiot contrarian snob who thinks going against the grain somehow makes you look \"cool\" and ''edgy''. It gives you a sense of purpose, makes you feel better about yourself. People like you are so insecure. Simply pathetic. It must suck to be an annoying depressed condescending asshole like you.\" \n\nBefore I give my thoughts of the topic the title, I will like to say that I am no way, shape or form pretentious. I'm against pretention. I never ever want to see or think of myself as the greatest thing ever because if there's one personal philosophy that I got out of Fight Club that would take with me to the grave is that man or woman is a snowflake. So, this got me thinking, is it wrong seeing films as an art form? why can't we see films more than just entertainment? I don't think so. I know that entertainment is the factor of films, but what about those who wishes to see film as this amazing art that can convey meaning? There are essays online that analyzing the deeper meaning of film. There are countless books on film that looks into them in critique way. Filmmakers like Werner Herzog &amp; Tarantino live, breath, eat &amp; craps cinema for a living.  I disagree with this person because there are people out there who do find in multiple of things in a non-pretentious way. Either it's books or music. I myself can recognize when a film is simply entertainment but I can also recognize what's to be more, it wants to be thought provoking or experimental. So what do you think? Do you see films as an art form? What is it about films that holds a strong bold to you? Let me know in the comments. Thanks.",

        "text": "I was seeing this movie yesterday, and it made me think, when people talk about Indian movies on here, they only talk about Hindi movies, while at the international and national stages movies in Malayalam and Bengali take all the awards. \n\nJust like any other regional cinema industry in India, [Malayalam cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_cinema) is targeted at a very small audience (Kerala's population is less than 3% of India's population and native speakers of Malayalam number about 38 million (worldwide), when compared to around 300 million for native Hindi speakers). \n\nNaturally, this means that Malayalam cinema has had limited funding options available and has had to be highly focused on realism and pragmatism, with Malayalis and Malayali culture being a predominant theme. As a result, Malayalam cinema has historically put enormous focus on story, script and acting, giving these much higher preference than commercialism. The focus on real issues faced by humans have provided Malayalam actors/directors/scriptwriters with a rich and surprisingly diverse array of stories, subjects and situations to be depicted through them. \n\nConsequently, along with their contemporaries in the Bengali film industry, Malayalam cinema has been known to have pioneered the Parallel cinema (or Art Cinema or New Wave Cinema) movement in India. Kerala's high literacy rate and the focus on education have also resulted in a relatively larger number of talented and experienced writers and artists, who have been exposed to, and influenced by the greatest in their fields.\n\nfrom Wikipedia\n\n\n\"Adoor Gopalakrishnan extended the Indian New Wave to Malayalam cinema with his film Swayamvaram in 1972. Long after the Golden Age of Indian cinema, Malayalam cinema experienced its own 'Golden Age' in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some of the most acclaimed Indian filmmakers at the time were from the Malayalam industry, including Adoor Gopalakrishnan, K.P. Kumaran, [G. Aravindan], John Abraham, Padmarajan, Bharathan, T. V. Chandran and Shaji N. Karun.[26] Gopalakrishnan, who is often considered to be Satyajit Ray's spiritual heir,[27] directed some of his most acclaimed films during this period, including Elippathayam (1981) which won the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival, as well as Mathilukal (1989) which won major prizes at the Venice Film Festival.[28] Shaji N. Karun's debut film Piravi (1989) won the Camera d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, while his second film Swaham (1994) was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.[29] His third film Vanaprastham (1999) was also selected to Cannes Film Festival, making him the only Indian film maker who could take consecutively three films to Cannes.\"\n\nSo as I was saying, I was watching this movie \"Njandukalude Nattil Oridavela\" (\"A break from the land of crabs\", [download link](https://itorrents.org/torrent/29EA6AB7FFF92C7C56974C6D9F200068945ECAA8.torrent?title=-+Njandukalude+Nattil+Oridavela+%282017%29+Malayalam+Original+720p+DVDRip+x264+5+1+1+2GB+ESubs+mkv) for anyone interested, has Esubs too), it is a fun ride, nothing groundbreaking. I have always felt that there was something different about the movies from this part of the world, I see Bollywood, Hollywood films and the intimacy with the viewer is felt in so few films. I'm immensely proud of malayalam films and I thought about how it is so underrated.

        "text": "I'm late to the party, but I got around to watching The Killing of a Sacred Deer and I'm struggling a bit to interpret it. Obviously you can look at scenes in different ways and it depends what you think the film as a whole is about; also, either there is a deeper meaning to them or they are just there to unsettle you and add to the particular atmosphere of the film (especially considering who is directing it and what his previous work felt like). I'm not looking for a definitive answer, I simply want to hear your view on this and talk about it. \n\n________________________________\n\n1. I think some of the possible themes are easy to spot. We have a story about justice or revenge with the an eye for an eye mentality, where Martin takes the place of a god Steven has to sacrifice to. This is reinforced, for instance, by Anna kissing his feet and by the title of the movie.\n\n2.  Steven, who is very much in control of his life (and as a cardiologist also others'), to the point where it seems robotic, is feeling more and more powerless as the film progresses and Martin's prophecy comes true, which is then perfectly brought to a climax by him blindly spinning around and shooting multiple times before hitting his son. And all of this is (presumably) happening because he doesn't take responsibility for his mistake, which he has told no one about and only the anesthesiologist knows about. I wonder, though, why is he buying Martin all those presents - is it because he feels guilty or because he hopes he can stave off any negative consequences by spending time with Martin? We know he's lying about it to Anna and other people, but this alone isn't enough for me to decide on the former or the latter since guilt and shame can lead to lying just as much as calculated manipulation. \n\n3. What would you say is the purpose of the cold world we are presented with? Everything has the feeling of a transaction to it, Anna and Steven's love life, every conversation or later when the family members start bargaining for their lives. Bob by cutting his hair and wanting to water the plants, Kim by offering herself up (which wasn't genuine) and Anna going a different route by saying \"We can always have another baby\". Do you see this as a criticism of developments in our society (especially in connection with the control Steven has over his life)? Or does it only serve to create the awkward atmosphere Lanthimos is known for or is it to separate the film clearly from real life by making the interactions unrealistic? \n________\n\nThen there are many scenes I don't know what to think of. I'm going to mention a few scenes and my opinion about it. Feel free to disagree and offer your own explanation.  \n\n\n**a) The daughter and the french fries**\n\nIn the beginning, Martin tells Steven french fries are his favorite. At the end of the film, in the diner scene, Kim eats some french fries with ketchup and we get a close-up of it. I can't say I can come up with a halfway sensible interpretation of this and I can say the same the whole relationship of Kim with Martin. However, I did find u/Rututu's from a previous post about this movie very interesting: \n\n\n&gt;Martin represents the repressed guilt, alcoholism and emotional problems of the father. These problems occupy the father, making him neglect his children. This is shown by the father spending time with Martin instead of his family.\n\n&gt;In the end, the fathers emotional problems end up \"paralyzing\" the children. They lose the will to eat, because they're living in an unhealthy home. The father cant rid himself of his problems (Martin) before something really bad happens and opens his eyes.\n\n&gt;The whole love angle between Martin and Kim represents how girls with \"dad issues\" can act out sexually and look for a replacement for their absentee father in other men. The end shows us that Kim still has a risk of falling for a man for the wrong reasons. She hungrily eats the fries that Martin loves the most.\n\nI really like this point of view, although I'm not always sure how to reconcile some things with this like Is Kim begging Martin to make her better. Would this stand for the older partner not being all that great and not what the young girl expects? \n\n**b) Martin's mother**\n\nWhat is the point of her? Martin wants Steven to be with her or is at least ok with it, so I'm guessing this is a way Steven could make things right in Martin's eyes, which would ofc require him to leave his family. But is this all that's to it? \n\n\n**c) Martin lying to Anna about Steven flirting with his mom**\n\nFor me this was just to further unsettle the family and I think you the effects of it (paired with the whole dying kids thing) in one of the the next scenes, in which Anna and Steven get into a fight and it shows how the formerly perfect family life unravels/has unraveled. And it isn't just this instance, Anna subsequently doubts her husband's story about the Martin's dad and asks the anesthesiologist. \n\n\n**d) Steven's beautiful hands**\n\nMartin's mother sexualizes/worships them and later Anna is kissing them as well. Is this to symbolize how Steven wants to appear as perfect as possible and what other people like Martin's mom sees doctors as? Or, and I think this is the better interpretation, does it show how Steven's hands are clean (no one except Martin blames him) and doesn't want to admit his mistake made during the surgery of Martin's father? The scene when Steven is throwing away his blood-stained gloves ties into this, although I'm sure you can see it representing different things. \n\n\n\n**e) Few vs many friends**\n\nMartin mentions he only has a few friends, which Steven finds perfectly fine. Much later, Bob says he has three friends and Steven says it's good to have many friends. It could be just small talk, but in a film like this I doubt it is.\n\n\n\n**f) Martin comparing how much body hair he and Steven have**\n\nIs it just something weird to set the tone or is there something else to it? Same for the talk about Kim's menstruation, which seems to be a popular topic for the family. ",

        "text": "I know this has been discussed at great length here already, but I saw this film only lately and needed some time to process it. Hope you find my review worthy of discussion. Let me know if I misinterpreted something or missed an important detail! \n\nAfter mother! we got another movie that's chock-full of Biblical metaphors, but this time the metaphors are not the point, they're just a vessel. Yorgos Lanthimos mashes up the Biblical God with the gods of Greek myths to convey a story about how a toxic domestic atmosphere of lies and deceit can ruin a family.\n\nIt's no surprise that Martin, the kid with godlike powers played by Barry Keoghan, loves Groundhog Day, a movie about an unexplained karmic power that probably stems from the subconscious regrets of the protagonist to intervene in his life. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a surgeon who keeps many secrets. At the beginning of the movie, he is barely able to keep his secrets away from his home and from his workplace. He meets Martin only in neutral places until suddenly Martin shows up at the hospital, as it gets harder for him to compartmentalize his regretful thoughts about killing a patient. Later in the movie, Martin shows up at their home, and first, he is greeted with openness, but later his presence comes as a burden. He is kept as a prisoner in the basement, but even from down there, his influence is felt, as he slowly poisons the relationships between Steven's family members.\n\nEach family member represents a different level of repression or secrecy. Steven's youngest, Bob, with his unkempt hair, untainted by civilization, is the most naive member of the family, who doesn't even have any secrets. He says so to his father, a well-groomed, bearded man who pays a lot of attention to his appearance and has a lot to hide. Bob later becomes more familiar with the inner workings of our civilized society built on deceit. He tries to manipulate his father by telling him that he chose him as a role model, even cutting his hair to match his father's request. Just like Bob, all other members of the family get more and more tangled in a web of lies thanks to Steven's secrecy. Nicole Kidman's Anna has sex with Steven's colleague to obtain classified information from him, Raffey Cassidy's Kim presumably makes a pact with Martin, not knowing that Martin likely never meant to keep his end of the bargain. Martin himself, an outsider to Steven's family, starts out the movie by telling Steven that he cut his hair, knowing that that's something Steven would likely appreciate. This exchange kicks off a long series of manipulation and deceit.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos directs his movie with a firm hand. The staccato, artificial line delivery that is closely associated with his filmmaking style is only rarely broken apart from. In moments when the absolute raw feelings come to the surface, we see the characters speak more naturally. Colin Farrell's Irish accent subtly (but probably not intentionally) appears in these moments, making them even more unsettling. It's a testament to Lanthimos' ability that these loud, honestly emotional moments do not come through as powerful and relatable, but as disconcerting and uncomfortable. The camerawork certainly helps here, Lanthimos' longtime collaborator Thimios Bakatakis takes his cues from Stanley Kubrick's distant but effective works like Barry Lyndon and The Shining, with slow zooms taking the place of establishing shots. This not only helps alienate the characters but uses the environment as an oppressing, menacing presence, making you feel unsure what hides behind the perspective of the lens.\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer is only my second entry to the Greek director's filmography, and I can only imagine how much is left to unpack here. Compared to The Lobster, another film that explores artificial relationships and repressed emotions, this movie is harder to digest but is overall a more satisfying experience.\n\nThe review was posted here originally.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7ssf1t/the_coen_brothers_original_or_overrated/",
        "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I’ve been watching the Coen brothers’ movies for years, and I see the entertainment value in their work. In addition to their frequent collaboration with the visual genius that is Roger Deakins, I think their editing is great, and the way they [punctuate seemingly mundane dialogue with silences and well-placed beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UE3jz_O_EM) really elevates their scenes into something more than the sum of its parts. I also think they know how to create memorable characters (Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, Jerry Lundegaard and others in Fargo, the Dude in The Big Lebowski). In other words, I am not questioning their craft.\n\nThat said, I think they bring nothing new to the table, and their critical acclaim seems more manufactured than earned. To many, this is the equivalent of coming out as a Communist during the 50s, but I will attempt to outline my opinion.\n\nThe way I see it, good directors typically play with genre crossovers. A few push the envelope even further, exploring stories through their own worldview, effectively going beyond genre. Think of David Lynch, who consistently balances the mundane with the profane. David Foster Wallace defined \"Lynchian\" as \"a particular kind of irony where the very macabre and the very mundane combine in such a way as to reveal the former’s perpetual containment within the latter.’ He further explains it as being a \"confluence of very dark, surreal and violent stuff and absolute, almost Norman Rockwell, banal American stuff.\" Another example where the two (albeit less) extreme sides of the mundane-profane spectrum are explored is in the (earlier) work of David Cronenberg, where Lynch’s “profane” is replaced with Cronenberg’s trademark [corporeal](https://www.google.ca/search?q=corporeal&amp;oq=corporeal) (body-related) horror. Later on he would go on to explore the overlap in A History of Violence, within the confines of a more straightforward thriller genre.\n\nI bring these examples up because the Coens have walked this line in their better movies like Fargo, where a town of simple folk (that are caricature-like and farcical in the way they are conceived and written) is struck by grotesque violence. Or in No Country For Old Men, where a villain capable of extreme violence rocks an 80s mop top and wreaks havoc on Texas. These Coenesque mundane/profane overlaps have always seemed gimmicky to me, like a second-tier Lynch. It is not a worldview, but a cheap two-way deal of (a) “legitimizing” their comedy by adding violence into the mix to “elevate” the material into the usual “critique of the world we live in ... etc.”, and (b) contrasting the violence with comical elements in order for it to be “fresh”.\n\nFor their other work, I really think that if movies like Blood Simple, Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Man Who Wasn’t There, Burn After Reading, and Inside Llewyn Davis were made by any other director, they would be long forgotten. Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers, and Hail Caesar! were just plain bad, except for a few funny scenes here and there.\n\nAlmost every celebrity out there publicly advertises how much they want to work with the Coens. For the aforementioned reason that they know how to create memorable characters, I get it. But sometimes, this borders on reverential, which signals something else. For example, check out this video where William H. Macy recounts how desperate he was to get the role in Fargo since [“it was Joen and Ethan Coen, everyone was going to see it—everyone in the biz—whether it was a hit or not, everyone was going to see it”](https://youtu.be/chLoIwp7DJU?t=62). Remember that this was before Fargo went on to make waves—right until then they have made The Hudsucker Proxy (a box office bomb by all accounts), Barton Fink (another indie art-house movie that was popular in Europe), Miller’s Crossing, Raising Arizona, and Blood Simple. Why would Macy (an actor I love) say this about two then relatively-new indie directors who had more misses than hits under their belt up to that point? Yes, some of these went on to become cult classics like Barton Fink and Miller’s Crossing, but do these movies warrant the kind of reverence and adoration that Hollywood had for them at the time that Macy is talking about? For example does Miller’s Crossing deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas, The Godfather, or Scarface for example ([Source 1](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/millers-crossing-crime) | [Source 2](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/14/20-best-gangster-films-of-all-time/millers-crossing-joel-coen-1990/))? There are many filmmakers that consistently churn out great movies that don’t seem to get the same respect or acclaim that the Coens do. Sometimes it gets really excessive, as in this critic’s [praise for the sound of the shovel in a scene in Blood Simple](https://youtu.be/20et-nV-k1k?t=948).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n*Edited some spelling mistakes.",

        "text": "I've seen many discussions on this subreddit and elsewhere where people levy considerable criticism against Three Billboards for not making clear the \"moral alignment\" of it's characters, but I think that this viewpoint is missing the point  and ignoring a major theme of the movie. This movie goes out of it's way to portray shades of grey in almost every aspect. It asks the question \"How bad is irredeemable? Can a racist or a wife beater or an innocent kid be more than their labels?\" Recall that, aside from Mildred, nearly every character is introduced to us by reputation before we actually meet them. We are told that the Chief is an uncaring, lazy asshole because he hasn't made progress on the case, but as we get to know him, we learn that the opposite is true, that he couldn't make progress despite trying his hardest because there legitimately were no leads. We are told that Dixon is generic racist white trash who lives with his mom, but we learn that he lives with his mom to take care of her, and that his hotheadedness and prejudice is born of his own insecurities. Even Angela was said to be a kind, innocent girl, but we learn from the flashbacks that she was just as rebellious and angry as Mildred. \n\nCharlie's reputation is that of a drunk and a heavily abusive father, but we learn that he genuinely loves and cares for his kids, that he never abused them, and that they may have preferred him to Mildred. Remember that Angela even doubted that Charlie beat Mildred in the first place, which means that even if he did, he never did when the kids were around. Also, home life at their household was acidic even after they were divorced and Mildred was shown provoking Charlie multiple times. He was never shown to be the aggressor. In fact, he was shown to be more rational and grounded than Mildred.\n\nI just spend a whole paragraph justifying the actions of a wife beater. On the surface, this seems bad, but it's exactly what McDonagh set out to do. I feel like a lot of people weren't expecting these characters to be more than what they're initially presented as, so when their moments of characterization do happen, they view it as an error. Or, they see a character who is \"racist\" or \"misogynistic\" not having these character traits overwritten and think \"This movie is condoning this behavior because the character is shown to be redeemed while not either suffering for their flaws or eliminating them altogether.\" Let's be clear: Three Billboards is not condoning or condemning anything. It's merely portraying flawed, realistic, human characters. To reduce Dixon as a character down to a racist, or Charlie down to a misogynist, is just being dishonest. Ultimately, the point of this type of characterization is to ask \"Can a character be redeemed as a whole while still having flaws? What kinds of flaws are unforgivable? Under what circumstances are flaws acceptable?\" It's completely fine to answer each of these questions in the negative, but it is not fine to consider it a flaw of the film.",

        "text": "It's kind of old but I just saw it, and it really blew me away. It's hard to separate fact from fiction in this film, so I don't strongly stand by any conclusions I try to draw here. It would be nice to have some discussion or debate.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, it's directed by Vitaly Mansky, and follows a girl's life in NK over the course of a year. All footage has been inspected by NK and almost all the scenes have been fabricated. Mansky shows a kind of behind-the-scenes, of the making of the film NK intended him to make. I think the most interesting thing about the film is that there are effectively two directors: Mansky and the NK state, and they have goals that are polar opposites. Mansky, being \"Western aligned\", is a Russian living in Riga renown for being highly critical of the Putin administration. I can't imagine that the state representatives in North Korea could have *not* known Mansky's political stances beforehand and that directly conflict with their own goals. Knowing this, it really makes me wonder what sort of image NK was trying to convey to the world through Mansky.\n\nFirst though, there's a lot to say about Mansky's portrayal of NK. To be honest, I feel like he stretches the truth a bit as well, though obviously nowhere near as egregiously as NK. It's just small things that shape the mood of the film that don't feel so genuine. For example, silence plays a big role in this film and he uses it often. He portrays NK as eerily silent. Even when there are large crowds of people walking by, no one appears to be talking. We just hear the stomping of shoes on the ground. Later, it's made more clear that these crowds are likely extras, directed just to walk, and thus they probably do so in an artificial way. It might be a mistake to attribute these moments of silence to the real North Korea. Then there's portrayal of the children. They are always in uniform, or in costume. They are never playing. They converse with each other little. They do as they're told. They appear to live at school and rarely see their families. It's very easy to believe all of this at face value. However it didn't sit well with me since I previously saw the documentary Dear Pyongyang (2005) by Yang Yong-hi. It paints a completely different image of children in NK, having scenes of them playing on the street in plain clothes. Occasionally in that film, we also see children and parents walking together in what appear to be candid shots of the sidewalks while Yang is on the bus. I don't see a reason to distrust Yang's footage any more than Mansky's. I think the image of children Mansky sees was heavily curated by NK. It's an image of children who are always properly dressed, who are perfectly obedient, and who answer all the questions perfectly in school, the \"ideal\" child according to NK.\n\nIt brings me to the other stuff NK seemed to want to portray. Many scenes are almost comical with the fake smiles. Mansky shows some very powerful images when he focuses on their faces and captures their smiles fading for just a split second. It seems everyone is happy, and everyone loves Kim Jong Il. At the end of the day, they want to tell us something though. I think they want to convey to us a feeling of hopelessness. They're telling us \"Our people are so dedicated and so proud, you cannot win them over! Not even our children!\" And they're not only telling us this, they are telling Mansky this. I think this is why Mansky has the pessimism he does.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can't forget that I see the film not only through the lenses of Mansky and the NK state, but also through my own. In general, I want to be more optimistic than Mansky. He has stated in interviews that he believes nothing will change for 50 years to come, and he's also stated that the NK people appear to have lost all their humanity. I guess deep down I might not want to believe Mansky's grim portrayal, but it may very well be the reality. The final scene with the girl was incredibly heartbreaking and from that scene alone I can understand Mansky's statements.\n\nThe scene: Zin-mi, the child, appears to genuinely cry. The NK director's voice tells the mother to console her. The mother tells her to think happy thoughts to stop crying. Then she tells Zin-mi to recite a cheerful poem. She recites NK propaganda from memory.\n\nIt's hard to say if the crying was scripted and the NK director was directing the mother's actions as intended, or if crying was unscripted and the NK director was directing the mother to console her to continue the scene. Many reviews online appear to believe the crying was genuine. What's strange is the long pause before the director intervenes, almost as if planned to allow the camera to get a good extended shot of the crying. Perhaps this is even without Mansky's knowledge. If it is genuine though, it's quite poignant that a child would recite propaganda more or less unprompted. It surely wouldn't inspire hope from us, the audience, for future generations.",
