        "text": "Good morning, BOLArinas!\n\nUp until now, we've allowed posts from other subreddits or websites, provided that there was some legal aspect of the post/link.  This has been a fun experiment, but it has not been overly successful.  Effective now, the only posts that will be allowed are links to r/legaladvice, r/LegalAdviceUK, r/AusLegal, and other subs like that.  Put shortly, we are limiting it to just subreddits that are specific to asking for and receiving legal advice.\n\nIf you find a post elsewhere that does have a significant amount of legal advice being given and would like to post it, exceptions *might* get made.  But, in order for that exception to be made, **you must first send a message to modmail asking permission to submit the link.**  Failure to send us modmail first will result in the post being removed, even if it's fantastic.\n\nIf you want another place to ~~reap that sweet karma~~ share your non\\-LA type links, be sure to visit our cousins at r/badlegaladvice.  Many of the posts that have been shared here would be more appropriate there.\n\nThe reason for this change is that the majority of posts that we've received that were links to other subs have only tenuously been related to legal advice at best.  A lot of the time, it barely comes up to legal advice, taps it on the shoulder, and then runs away screaming.\n\nAnother note: **This does not change the rules regarding non\\-participation.**  Just because we're limiting the places you can link to, it does not give you permission to follow a BOLA link into the thread and start commenting.  ***Don't do it.***  \n\nLast note: The mod team would like to remind you about our policy on doxxing.  ***Don't do it.***  You will be banned, without notice and without any sort of review, if it is believed that you are doxxing, attempting to dox, indicating that you will dox, or in any other way trying to identify the OP, victims, the case, the location, or anything related.  Don't even hint that you know who OP is or have found their case or anything else of that nature.\n\nNow let's get out there and play the best game of basketball we can!  Go team!",
