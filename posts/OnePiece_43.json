They share important physical characteristics (immense height, tan skin, long curly black hair) and neither have been shown to sleep. Though you could argue Kuma's case is due to being a cyborg.\n\nNow, in Kuma's memory seen on Egghead, the silhouettes of Celestial Dragons are visible, as are buildings similar to those found in Mariejois, but Kuma's memory suspiciously does not show it to be Mariejois, so where else could it be? Here comes more conjecture.\n\nPerhaps God Valley was the home of an as-of-yet-unnamed race that needed no sleep, and thus made perfect slaves that could work 24/7 for the World Nobles. One day, a World Noble could have been checking on the slave race in God Valley when Rocks captured the World Noble for the ultimate hostage situation, triggering the God Valley incident, during which time Whitebeard adopted Teech, and Kuma's traumatic memory (the one seen by Bonney) of fleeing lethal pursuers (either Marines willing to eliminate all evidence or the Rocks Pirates on a sadistic killing streak) took place.",

        "text": "We are approaching One Piece's finale and we know that the only way to get to Laugh Tale is by gathering all **4 Road Poneglyhs** which will indicate its **location**.\n\nWe know for sure that three of them are already in the hands of some characters that we know all too well. Both **Luffy** and **Law** have the one found in **Zou** and the one found in **Wano**. **Kidd** also has the Wano one thanks to Law and like Luffy he also has the one located at **WCI**. In the recent cover stories we saw **Aokiji** and **Van Auger** kidnapping Pudding at WCI which obviously means they got a copy of the Road Poneglyph too. The question now is: who has the fourth one?\n\nWe know that the fourth Road Poneglyph was originally located at **Fishman Island** but was later moved by someone.\n\nThere are various characters that we can think could have it: **Teach, Vegapunk, Buggy**, etc. but the reality is that narratively speaking there is just one character in particular that makes more sense than all the above, namely **Shanks**.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think the fourth Road Poneglyph is on some other remote island. Primarily because whoever moved it must have entrusted it to someone strong enough and above all important enough to protect it, and also because the final war is now approaching, and it would not make sense for Luffy to find the fourth Road Poneglyph by chance and head to Laugh Tale without any problems.\n\nAmong the 5 final competitors directed to Laugh Tale which are **Luffy, Law, Kidd, Teach, and Shanks**, the latter is certainly the most mysterious. Ironically, he's the character that besides Luffy we've known the longest but know the least about. What is his real goal? Why is he just taking action just now and what exactly was he waiting for? Obviously, it is logical to think that if Shanks hasn't acted much all this time, he has at least **one starting point and therefore at least 1 Road Poneplyh**, the one removed from Fishman Island. He was part of **Roger's crew** but did not arrive at Laugh Tale due to Buggy's illness but he probably knew the location of the 4 Road Poneglyphs and only started to move now because he understood that Luffy has already grouped 3 of them.\n\nAnother interesting thing to look at is who owns the most Road Poneplyghs at the moment. If Shanks owned the fourth the result would be as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||ZOU|WCI|WANO|FISHMAN ISLAND (MOVED)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|LUFFY|X|X|X||\n|LAW|X||X||\n|TEACH||X|||\n|KIDD||X|X||\n|SHANKS||||X|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalyzing this table we notice very interesting things:\n\n1. Luffy owns 3 and is currently not clashing with any.\n\n2. Teach owns 1 and is fighting Law who owns 2.\n\n3. Shanks owns 1 and is about to collide with Law who owns 2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNarratively speaking, the clashes **Teach vs Law** and **Kidd vs Shanks** are certainly exciting and awaited but their outcome is quite obvious. Shanks has been waiting for more than 20 years to enter the scene, while Teach is obviously Luffy's number 1 nemesis for obvious reasons. As much as I like Law and Kidd as characters, there are several reasons why I think they're going out:\n\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Kidd and Law are no emperors. Kidd and Law together defeated Big Mom but still didn't become yonkos. Why? **Because they don't have a fleet, territories, and not even a minimally comparable crew to those of Luffy, Teach, Shanks, and even Buggy (Cross Guild).** \n\n2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Kidd and Law's primary function has always been to be rivals to Luffy, but it was obvious from the start that they weren't going to make it to the end. Law in addition to being at a natural disadvantage with Teach, the chances of him coming out on top are even less if you think that Teach has half of his crew with him which certainly compared to that of Law is much more dangerous. Kidd has to face Shanks and his entire crew and it is unlikely that Killer, Wire, and Heat will be able to face **Benn Beckmann, Lucky Roo, Yasopp**, and the rest of the crew on their own.\n\nWith Teach and Shanks victorious both would take 2 Road Poneglyph each from the two supernovas and would have 3 just like Luffy. The result would be the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||ZOU|WCI|WANO|FISHMAN ISLAND (MOVED)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|LUFFY|X|X|X||\n|SHANKS||X|X|X|\n|TEACH|X|X|X||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould this mean we will have a **Luffy vs Shanks vs Teach (vs Buggy)** final battle to Laugh Tale? Let me know your opinion in the comments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyrku6k0gmka1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e0c12bb2c56687dfc62d4eef603b580272d1fda8",

What if Kuina had been kidnapped instead and presumed dead?\nThis actually explains a lot and has a little to do with Zolo‚Äôs relationship with Tashigi, the right hand of Vice Admiral Smoker. This would lead to Tashigi wanting to become a Marine, but why would Tashigi know who Kuina is? What if Kuina and Tashigi were sisters (Internal Twins), which explains their similar looks and likes, as they are both swordsmen. \nTashigi is nice passive and prideful to others; however, not entirely nice to criminals. Kuina is smug and determined, those two are complete opposites and similar. So if they‚Äôre sisters, this would most likely cause Tashigi to become a Marine in order to receive the right training to become a swordsman just like her sister.\n\nThe real question is, why would Kuina get kidnapped? My guess is that Kuina had eaten a rare devil fruit before being sold to the government by Koushirou.\n\nIt may not make full sense but again, it is just a theory. Let me know what you guys think.",

Awakened Chopper or Franky Shogun plus basic armament haki is yonkou crew material. Giant clone robin with armament would be a big problem literally. Jimbei can still learn more advanced haki to be as strong as endgame Zoro/Sanji thus a true threat to any enemy they fight. They all need to be able to handle themselves In future battles and haki is a main component going forward.",

        "title": "[CHAPTER 1076 SPOILERS] Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla in One Piece",
        "author": "JUNISXO",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11curap/chapter_1076_spoilers_thomas_edison_and_nikola/",
        "text": "First of all, i want to point out that this is NOT going to be a theory, but rather just me collecting some ideas and observations i made, and i'm not as skilled in piecing together information like my fav theorists are (marco the theroist, arthur from library of ohara) so really all i want to do with this post is not make an insane connection or theory, but rather just mention some interesting stuff, that MAYBE (hopefully :D) people could interpret further and connect to something else, kind of making it make sense. If ANYONE has already had the same thoughts as me and had posted them before me, PLEASE let me know so i can credit them and make sure people see their original posts!\n\nWith that being said: \n\nAs we all know, one of the 6 vegapunks is named after the famous scientist Thomas Edison. \n\nSIDE NOTE: The only ones that look like roboters and dont have a human-like silhouette, are Edison the scientist, and Pythagoras the ancient mathematician/philosopher. Interesting detail. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4v7nvh8vhjka1.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ea6601f911d377539fe7b157352f173863559572\n\nSo i thought, if there's Edison, then there definitely has to be a Tesla reference too, since Edison and Tesla were rivals in the field of electricity. \n\n\\*QUICK BACKSTORY\\*: It's said that Edison tried to discredit Tesla's AC-System and promote his own DC System as safer and more efficient. He even used Tesla's system to electrocute a criminal in an electric chair. However, later it was found that Tesla's AC-System was actually more effective, especially in transmitting electricity over long distances. \n\nSo the story goes: Tesla died a poor man, he invented a lot of great things, he was a genius but did not get the credit he deserved, while Edison was the one getting the recognition. \n\nAnd interestingly enough, I found some references to Tesla too! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla's Energy Fence: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b92snl15lka1.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5e7dd4f9af01d3aec019a63536605fb7207fbea9\n\nMotivated by his hatred of warfare, Tesla imagined and even claimed to have successfully created an invisible wall of energy; an energy fence that could eliminate anything that enters its radius. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is basically the same idea of Vegapunks ,,Frontier Dome'' , which protects the Island from any potential threats entering it's radius.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iffu6mfb4lka1.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5e315e4376f716c2d324340d2eae5ef8ae1f5fa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[It's even shaped like a dome](https://preview.redd.it/mdlg5o3w4lka1.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cd41c72473d5558ba3c1b6806ff785f6fb76fd3b)\n\nTesla's Dream: \n\n[bro is sitting like its no big deal](https://preview.redd.it/6trc7rrmnlka1.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c797d23a9e164d7e7ab17b024a5bcb6430c19374)\n\nIt's known that Tesla dreamed of finding a method to make energy available, wireless and for free to everyone, since he believed it could improve people's lives and the world for the better.  \n\nThe same scheme we're seeing with Vegapunk who not only shares some of Tesla's inventions just translated into the one piece world, but also his world view. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kq63x59cplka1.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c1da42c4107cf2b72c75975ac4a8a6151e4d4fb5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat's confusing to me, is that Vegapunk resembles some of Tesla's characteristics, but has a satellite named after Edison, who behaved in a shady manner towards Tesla. Could it be that, just like a lot of people are saying right now, Edison (satellite 03) is the traitor and is ,,sabotaging'' Vegapunk (all of the other satellites) just like the real Edison did with Tesla? If we consider that Edison (satellite 03, the one who ,,comes up'' with ideas) also stole all of those inventions from someone that resembles Tesla in this story, who could be Tesla ? \n\nIt's not Vegapunk, since Edison IS part of Vegapunk, more specifically the most important part when it comes to innovating, the thinker! So how could he steal from himself ? That doesn't make much sense to me as of rn. \n\nSo who could Vegapunk (Edison) possibly have ,,stolen'' or referenced his creations and technology from? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pl46yl5tlka1.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a831345a9e8b54a21a9ff664826d91fdc3e15dc\n\nIt's as Vegapunk later on said himself, this ancient civilization, most certainly the ancient kingdom that inspired him to model his whole system after having an own ,,sun'' to create an eternal source of energy ([Watch/Read this analysis from Arthur about how the ancient kingdom, mary geoise, the lunar civilization and the technology on the moon all tie together](https://thelibraryofohara.com/2022/11/21/chapter-secrets-chapter-1067-in-depth-analysis/)) . Tesla \\*could\\* be someone, a scientist/the scientists of the ancient kingdom, and Vegapunk is Edison, using their innovations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, some additional things i want to say and point out: \n\n\\- I'm not saying Vegapunk is not a genius, he could very possibly already have been a genius before getting access to the information of the ancient kingdoms technology \n\n\\- Vegapunk has shown to be a morally good dude, he has a moral compass, and I dont believe he is ,,stealing'' from the Ancient Kingdom, he definitely took it and made it his own and is even playing a bit role in reviving that technology which is why the government also wants him now eliminated as well. I just wanted to point out that inside of all the Vegapunks, there's Edison but not Tesla, maybe there is one and i havent just seen it yet, maybe it's someone else, maybe there isn't really one after all. I really don't know i just found that thought interesting since imo you kind of have to bring up Tesla when bringing up Edison. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosts I saw that also mentioned Tesla as well lol: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/yy2n88/nikolas\\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/yy2n88/nikolas_tesla/) \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/114ts3z/spoilers\\_1057\\_who\\_done\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/114ts3z/spoilers_1057_who_done_it/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ndear theorists pls just...try to come up with something, there has to be something there man xD",

The void century was the golden age of cartoons and joyboy was a child that aspired to be a cartoon character himself, so when he grew up he became a cartoon creator and made a show for the slaves of work in the modern era, people like office workers and debt filled depressive people, he made a show were the front runner was a cartoonish character call the sun god Nika(he loved his creation so much he wanted it to come to life which made the Hito Hito no mi: model Nika). Those work slaves called him joyboy because of the way it put smiles on their faces, like a ray of golden hope for freedom. \n\nAlmost like a ray of hope in an era of great depression, but when devil fruits started to exist the world grew to chaos of fun, smiles filled the world as it was burning down and crumbling around it. So 20 great nations across the world went under someone who can stop these devils(Imu could be the first user of haki). Their name might not be Imu but simply a title because of the correlation between the Sea effect on the devil fruits and their haki. But joyboy's insane imagination granted him the ability to do anything he wanted like the cartoon character he always wanted to be, but Imu was to tough and he had failed, his appearances was that of a laid back dude, haiwann shirt, cargo shorts and a comically large strawhat. They wrote messages to have fun and talk about what happened in the void century on indestructible cubes, but their language was lost to time and the only people who could read this almost extinct language was that of Ohara, And the reason the D. Clan are the enemy's of those buzzkills that ruined the golden age of fun was because that man's name was Boy D. Joy. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Everyone thinks that Luffy is the closest to becoming king of the pirates with those 3 Road Poneglyphs in his pocket as well as Robin who can translate them but in reality it is Shanks who is on the verge of becoming the next Pirate King. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, it's worth remembering that Shanks wants to be the next king of the pirates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5rml07gcqlka1.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ff63eb2d7b96181363d13b41c70690cbfeff7291\n\nYou would have thought that he was a bit like Whitebeard who wandered around the New World without really wanting to become the next pirate king, but it's just that he hasn't had the chance until now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen let's remember that it takes 4 Road Poneglyphs and a translator to reach Laughtale. \n\nAt the moment, we know the location of 3 Road Poneglyphs, 1 in Zou, 1 in Totto Land (Big Mom's territory) and 1 in Wano Kuni (former Kaido territory). The last one has never been shown so far and we don't know its location, all we know is that Roger had at least one copy or at best had it hidden somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShanks couldn't get them all without going to war with Kaido and Big Mom. For the one in Zou, it's almost certain that he has a copy since Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were all companions on Roger's ship and he himself went to Zou during his trip with Roger so he knows its location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/agst7gctqlka1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f70ee61c39f6839d11319b7d32670dcfa231da8b\n\nAs for the last Road poneglyph, I'm pretty sure Shanks has it or at least knows where to find it. So far, we know that only Roger managed to get a copy but Shanks being part of his journey, if he couldn't get the copy, he at least knows where it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo before the recent events in Wano Kuni, Shanks was limited to 2 Road poneglyphs in his possession without risking war with Kaido and Big Mom to get the last 2. \n\nHowever, the last chapter, 1076, gave away almost everything about Shanks future success as pirate king. We learn that he plans to fight Kidd to get those Road Poneglyphs since, in case you've forgotten, Kidd has the 2 Road Poneglyphs from Kaido and Big Mom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3dk4nbqgrlka1.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9de2bc66ca24fe0ee884d4b2ab2f9882c5a17aa6\n\nHis only real difficulty will be to beat Kidd to get these copies but honestly there is very little chance that he won't be able to do it with all his commanders and his fleet on his side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, the question of translating the Road poneglyphs remains to be answered. The question is almost immediately answered as he is in Elbaf and it was shown recently that Jaguar D. Saul is alive and able to translate the Road poneglyph.\n\nAlso, we learned with this last chapter that Shanks is very friendly with the giants, as we see with Dorry and Brogy so I don't see him being turned down by Saul if he is indeed a good friend of the giants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we just have to wait for Oda's story to see how the events will unfold, but in any case, a good explanation will be needed if Shanks doesn't succeed in becoming the next Pirate King, since he has all the keys in his hands to become one.",

        "text": "There have been many speculations on what luffy's dream is actually. From chapter 1060 it's clear that the dream is actually a wise dream at the same time childish (More of very difficult to achieve) seeing the reaction of straw hats so it cannot be something like having banquet with everyone or every race. Luffy and Roger have the same dream and luffy mentions \"I will have a shot if I become pirate king\". \nAfter Roger became pirate king, he used his last to fulfill his dream partially to create a new pirate era.\nIn one piece red movie when Uta asked Luffy, \"Why do you need one piece\" he replied \"To create a new era\". Even in the song which Uta sings in the beginning of one piece red the lyrics have similar sentences.\nOda has been pointing things towards people's dreams a lot time to time, like the relationship of devil fruits with dreams. Then every straw hat crew mate have a very unique dreams of their own.\nMy bet is that Luffy and Roger have the same dream that is \"To create a new era where everyone has freedom to fulfill their dreams\".",

It was said he has the most offensive df and oda hypes him a lot for some reason. This means that the manga would last less than a year with akainu beating a yonko at least.",
