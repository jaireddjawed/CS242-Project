        "text": "Hello! LTL here with my first TFTS post. Probably not that great in comparison to most but still really funny.\n\nBack story: Our Internet at home has been really spotty for the past month or so. Now that I think about it, it hasn't been that great since we had them install it in our new house! It constantly drops in and out and makes it a pain to use our networked devices. I know it isn't our router and I personally feel our ISP oversold.\n\nAnyways... Today I got a call at work from my boyfriend and he says the Internet at home has been out since he got up this morning. Since it is my name on the account, I put in a call to our ISP and get connected with their amazing (yes, sarcasm) automated service which walks me through the basic troubleshooting steps before sending me off to the next tier of support. Since I am not home, I text my BF to unplug and reconnect the power cable for the modem as the automated service asks and he lets me know that it is done. I continue on to tell him to do the same with our WiFi router. He again confirms that he did it. The automated service blabs on about how it still cannot see the modem and that they will send me off to a technician to further assist me. The live technician then asks me to reboot the modem and router, to which I told her that I had already done with the automated service. The tech confirms this and she just asks to confirm that the power light is on on the modem to rule out that it isn't a power issue. I go on to tell her that yes, there are lights on because we have tried this step numerous times in the past which does little for our issue. I also didn't feel the need to ask my BF to confirm the lights are on because DUH! The technician books an appointment for another technician to come out on site and resolve the issue. I'm thinking... \"Great! That went better than I expected!\" \n\nBut then... I get off the phone with ISP and tell my BF that the appointment is for tonight. BF replies with: \"Great!... Can I plug it back in now?\"\n\n*FACE PALM*\n\nTL;DR: Don't assume anything... even if you trust your boyfriend LOL. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to remove the ISP's name at the end and some grammatical errors.\n\n**Update!**\nThe technician came out on-site and after troubleshooting from the ISP's tap in the front of the property, to the demarc, into my attic, and down to my modem, we found the problemS! \nTurns out there was an issue with the line from the tap to the demarc - which is the fault of the ISP technician who originally installed it when we moved into the house. Then, there was also an issue with the coax cable from the demarc to the \"junction\" (or splitter) in the attic and the line from the splitter to the drop where the modem was then connected. There was too much noise on the line which was causing packet loss - this was the fault of the contractors who installed the cable when our house was being built. The ISP tech told us that they used really flimsy and low-grade coax cable. \"Standard\" but low-grade (the cheap stuff they buy in bulk). He also warned that if the noise in the lines does not get fixed, the ISP could shut off our Internet completely because the noise was going back out into the network which could cause disruption for others. So in the end, the ISP tech put in a new ticket to have them fix their line outside while I called my builder to have them come out and redo their cable runs.  So all in all, it was a good thing that my BF didn't plug that power cable back in because the phone tech would've just told me \"everything looks okay, it's not our problem\". Also, it was awesome that we had a great and hard working on-site technician who took the time to find the problem instead of making excuses to leave already. Had my share of that in the past.",

Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n**$Selben** - Previous Tier 1 tech support now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.\n\n \n\n**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant, and in a way $Selben’s boss - Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany until they decided to move on. Also had a never-ending supply of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!\n\n \n\n \n\n**$ITLead** - IT lead from current company.\n\n \n\n**$Whatif** - Administrative assistant, not the brightest, but a nice person.\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n$Selben and $Soda had gotten a two-month contract working on some IT projects at a company through an old contact of $Soda’s. $Soda was locked away slaving away as a code monkey. $Selben could still chat with him during breaks, but otherwise was mostly on his own. He spent his time working on whatever needed to be done—typically things the other techs did not want to do.\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n$Selben had accidentally finished all open projects, and the printers were (currently) behaving, so he had recently been shuffled off to work with the hardware technician. He started off his day boxing up newly configured equipment and shipping to different parts of the company. The whole facility was really big on recycling, so some of the boxes had old packaging labels on them from their previous use, like “monitor,” “printer,” or even “coffee,” but $Selben did try to cross out any confusing labels. After finishing the last shipment, $ITLead asked $Selben to remain in hardware for the rest of the day and work on repairs, as the hardware tech wasn't feeling well and had headed home. $Selben enjoyed hardware, so he was happy to do so.\n\n \n\nLunch time rolled around. $Selben was about to meet with $Soda for lunch, when he was stopped by a panicked $Whatif.\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n&gt; $Whatif: A user just called in. They said their laptop was stolen, again!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Send me the details. I’ll take care of it immediately!\n\n \n\n$Soda had rounded the corner in time to overhear the situation and offered to help as well. He was currently a code monkey, but no way would a single ticket get in the way of his lunch!\n\n \n\nReturning to $Selben’s desk, they pulled up the user’s information. They had just gotten a new laptop shipped to them, and the tracking information showed as “Delivered.” $Selben started to follow the procedure for a lost delivery, when $Soda stopped him.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: Hold up. $Whatif said the laptop was stolen **again**.\n\n \n\n$Selben looked up the previous requests from the user. Three laptops had been sent to the user recently, and all three had been “stolen.” The area wasn’t known for crime, so it was a bit strange.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda: I see some of these boxes for shipping say chips and other stuff.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Yeah. They like to recycle…I see.\n\n \n\n$Selben put on his headset and called the location.\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Hello?\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Hi there, this is $Selben from IT. I heard you may have had some laptops go missing?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Yep.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Soda *whispers*: Ask if they got ANYTHING from IT recently.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Have you gotten anything shipped from IT lately? Anything strange?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: No.\n\n \n\n$Soda’s brow furrowed, and he started to ponder.\n\n \n\n$Selben got an idea.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Who normally receives packages… Maybe check with them?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: *Sigh* Fine, I’ll ask our office admin.\n\n \n\nAfter a few minutes and some sudden shouting in the background, $User returned.\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Never mind! We found the laptops. Thanks, bye.\n\n \n\nThe user quickly hung up.\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\nApparently, the hardware tech had gotten a really good deal on some recycled boxes. They were heavy duty corrugated cardboard able to hold 80lbs. But they were meant for shipping frozen fish and the outside packaging matched. So, when the “Frozen Fish” had shown up at the user’s location (three separate times), rather than opening the boxes, the office admin took the boxes and shoved them into their stand-up freezer. Why she thought IT would send frozen fish is still unknown.\n\n \n\nAll the laptops still worked, once they warmed up after being removed from the freezer. A new shipping policy was implemented, and the hardware tech started covering up logos and descriptions on recycled boxes from that point forward.\n\n",

I need it fixed as soon as possible.\n\n\nNow, with doctors, there is little time to troubleshoot as their in and out of their offices in a flash and often won't give an IT guy the time of day. But I happen to have this amazing program and it tells me all sorts of useful information. I pop into the system and see that the printer's reading offline. Now since I installed this printer myself I'm pretty aware that the most likely reason is it's either off or the Ethernet cable came a little loose. \n\n&gt; $Ofmiceandusers: Hey Doc, the printer's on, all the lights are lit up right? \n\n&gt; $Dr.I'malwaysright: Of course, I checked myself. \n\n&gt; $Ofmiceandusers: Ok, can you check to make sure the blue cord is plugged into both the wall and the printer?\n\nThe Doctor goes and supposedly checks it all but can't seem to find anything wrong with it. Well there isn't much I can do remotely that I can see in my program. Onsite visit it is!\n\nI arrive, Doc's in his office. Immediately my eyes narrow and I see that the cable was unplugged from the wall. Because of course it was. Popping it back in, I gave him a nod before asking him to verify he could print and billed them for onsite time that took me a total of two seconds. ",

We are currently finishing up the last loose ends.\n\nI got a call today from a technician:\n\nTech: Hi nutral, we are trying to comission the last heat exchanger, but we can't get the flow we need.\n\nMe: What kind of flow are you getting? And what is the inlet pressure?\n\nTech: about 33 m3/h on the bypass and about 3 barg, through the heat exchanger it's 2m3/h.\n\nI was thinking, the heat exchanger was designed for 40m3/h with about that pressure. For it to have only 5% means it only has 0.25% of the pressure. Something else has to be choking it.\n\nMe: did you check the control valve after the heat exchanger\n\nTech: No, but it shouldn't really matter with the bypass.\n\nMe: Ok, let me check a few things and i'll get back to you.\n\nI started checking the design of the thing, rerunning a couple of calculations. Did i make a mistake with calculating a few of the holes? Most of the calculations where correct and a small error couldn't make this difference.\n\nThen i called the production manager to ask if maybe they left something in that could be blocking the flow. But he didn't really have an idea. I also asked if maybe it wasn't made according to the drawings. He didn't think so but i he would take a look.\n\nAfter a few hours of thinking it over, i thought Well the only thing left is the 2 valves that connect to the heat exchanger. I sent this message:\n\nMe: This might be a really stupid question, but did you check if the 2 valves are actually opened?\n\nA message 1 hour later:\n\nTech: I just went up to check and they where closed! I thought they where open...\n\nWell at least i can stop worrying. But i think i should have started with that question as it is the same as checking the power cable when the computer doesn't start.",

        "text": "So you wanted more Ted stories. I have time today so you get another one before I get swamped with work during the rest of the week!\n\nWe go back to the time when Ted started working as an on site tech. As per company policy, he was given a work smartphone so that he could keep in touch with us, check his email and tasks and all the nice stuff you can do with a smartphone. I wasn't in the office when he got the phone.\n\nThe day after, he calls the help desk from his personal phone. I recognize the number so I refuse the call and call him back (we did this because I didn't want techs to spend any money out of their pocket, it happened rarely, like when their work phone was not working or had run out of battery). \n\n&gt;Ted: hey, I got this new phone but I don't know how to use it. *note that this guy was about 28 at the time, not 70*\n\n&gt;Me: well, I guess it can't be that difficult right? Making calls is pretty straightforward, if you need help to configure email on it you can ask Vincent about it... \n\n&gt;Ted, interrupting me mid-sentence, whining: but there is no instruction manual! How can I learn without an instruction manual?! The company must provide me with one! \n\n&gt;Me, facepalming: You can ask, otherwise you can look it up on the manufacturer website, or maybe just start poking around to get a sense of what's there.\n\n&gt;Ted: *more whining*\n\nFast forward to the morning after. Ted had sent an email telling us to please not call him on his work phone because he doesn't know how to use it. Apparently pressing that green button is too complicated.\n\nFast forward to the week after. Ted calls in and this time Andy picks up. He starts swearing as soon as he sees it's Ted.\n\n&gt;Andy: if he's still calling about his phone, I'll just throw myself from the pier with the full server rack strapped to my back *picks up* Hey Ted, what's up?\n\n&gt;Ted: listen, tell khaomanee that I can't use this new phone! I don't understand how the touchscreen works! *keeps on ranting*\n\n&gt;Andy, muting the speaker: hey boss, I'll go get the server rack, you deal with this? \n\n&gt;Me, from Andy's phone on speaker: Hey Ted, we discussed this long enough. It's not rocket science and if you really don't like this phone, I don't know why you don't talk to Vincent, he's the one managing  the phones, not me!\n\nNote that after this call Ted called Vincent, who came into my office shortly after asking me if Ted had special needs because he couldn't believe it. Welcome to our world, Vince...\n\nFast forward to the day after... Andy had assigned a task to Ted that included making a phone call to a software vendor. Ted calls us instead:\n\n&gt;Ted: I can't call $softwarevendor sorry, I don't know how to dial numbers on this phone!\n\n&gt;Me: so how did you make calls until now?!\n\n&gt;Ted: I've only called back the numbers who have called me!\n\n&gt;Me: ...\n\nIn the end, Ted had to keep the smartphone and he kept on whining about it for weeks, until I told him that I would write him up if he didn't stop. I think Vincent still tells the story of Ted and the smartphone at parties.",

        "text": "I am a member of Local Department IT. Our big Printer Co printers are a fancy setup, with network print queues that are installed and supported by Central IT and supplies that order themselves automatically. A Staff Member noticed that one was jamming repeatedly despite her noble efforts to unstick it, and followed protocol by emailing central IT to raise a ticket, thus creating Ticket Number One. Central IT passed Ticket Number One to us in Local Department IT and I had a go at unjamming the printer, but alas the printer would not behave. I left an “Engineer Called” sign on the printer and passed Ticket Number One back to Central IT for them to arrange a Printer Co engineer visit. The process began to break down immediately: Ticket Number One was raised by Staff Member so when Central IT raised a ticket with Printer Co, they raised it also in Staff Member’s name.\n\nPrinter Co, armed with Staff Member’s details and not anybody in IT, emailed Staff Member to ask for more information. Staff Member replied to Printer Co to say that it was an unreliable printer that was now repeatedly jamming. She CCd Central IT, thus creating Ticket Number Two. Central IT emailed Staff Member asking which printer this referred to. Staff Member replied, reasonably suggesting that they liaise with Local Department IT since she doesn’t know all that much about printers. Central IT promptly didn’t.\n\nA Printer Co engineer arrived and asked Receptionist where the broken printer is, which is information that Central IT had but simply didn’t pass on. Receptionist didn’t know where the broken printer was and called Central IT, creating Ticket Number Three. Receptionist was told which printer was broken, the Printer Co engineer tended to the printer and then left.\n\nCentral IT noted in Ticket Number One that a Printer Co engineer had been to repair the printer and emailed Staff Member to ask whether the issue was indeed resolved. Staff Member helpfully went to check the printer. The Printer Co engineer had not removed my “Engineer Called” sign. Staff Member advised Central IT that the printer remained unrepaired. Central IT raised another ticket with Printer Co, again in Staff Member’s name.\n\nPrinter Co, once again armed with Staff Member’s details, emailed her to ask specifically what troubleshooting steps had been taken. Staff Member replied to Printer Co, again reasonably suggesting that they liaise with IT since she doesn’t know all that much about printers. She also CCd Central IT, creating Ticket Number Four. Because this occurred at night, she received a reply from Central IT’s outsourced evening-and-weekend support centre, who helpfully replied:\n\n“Thank you for contacting us.\nPrinter Co has responded to you as raised a ticket for the printer issue.\nPrinter Co will not contact you again after the ticket is resolved.\n[Call resolved]“\n\nIn the morning, Central IT created Ticket Number Five, which they passed to Local Department IT to ask which printer Ticket Number Four referred to. This was the first that I had heard about any Printer Co visits, and wound up diving head first into our ticket management system to untangle the mess. I had to create a spreadsheet of \nthe timeline to figure out what happened when, sifting through Printer Co’s matter-of-fact emails and Staff Member’s increasingly desperate pleas to leave her alone and speak to an IT guy instead.\n\nI hate printers.\n",

I was also part of the help desk, but moved up.\n\n$Intern: help desk student intern (recently hired)\n\n$PhD: clueless faculty with a PhD (she also has this hate relationship with IT)\n\n$Me = myself\n\nOur $Intern picks up the phone call from $PhD.\n    \n   &gt; $PhD: I put my wireless solar keyboard under the light to charge, but its not working.\n\n$PhD has a Logitech K750 Wireless Solar Keyboard.\n\nThe $Intern goes down to try and fix the problem. The $Intern comes back and ask $Me for help with this issue. Since I knew where $PhD office is, I knew that there was no direct sunlight to charge her wireless solar keyboard. $Intern went back to $PhD's office and got the keyboard. \n\nOnce $Intern got back, $Intern and $Me went to the roof where it was nice and sunny. We left the wireless solar keyboard in the sunlight for 45 minutes to charge.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, $Intern and $Me went back to the roof to retrieve the wireless solar keyboard. $Intern brought the solar keyboard to $PhD. Wireless solar keyboard synced to the USB receiver, and worked like a charm.\n\nI guess $PhD assumed that leaving the wireless solar keyboard out by her window with no sunlight would have charged the batteries. It's a good lesson, that it's not like the solar powered calculators everyone used back in the K-12 school days. Those wireless solar keyboards are like the PV systems, where you need sunlight to generate electricity.",

This particular hardware tends to require a little shepherding to get back to normal after a FW update. \n\nI should note that the basic order of operations is the bootloader comes up, then the hardware manufacturer OS loads, starts our GUI, and finally when our GUI is talking to the controller the node name/ID is displayed. 'Typical' update failures are the bootloader either failing to kick off the OS, or the OS getting stuck in post-upgrade 'housekeeping'... 99% of the time, rebooting fixes the problem and lets the update finish.  \n\nThe client sent some interns to check and make sure that they were all in their normal state and displaying their node name. \n\n&gt; **Client (via text):** Seems like some of them don't have names. \n\n&gt; **Me (via text):** Hmm... I don't see them in the DHCP table and I can't ping them at their last known address so... \n\n&gt; **Client (text)** I'll go down there. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later I get a call from the client (C) and me (M)\n\n&gt; *(ring)*\n\n&gt; **M:** Mr. (client)!

I could have just had (IT admin) cycle the ports without making the hike. \n\nAnyway, not that exciting but I thought it was amusing, and I'm not sure of my IT vs. Spectrum support wherein I got 6 (3x different billing and 3x different support) departments to point the finger in a complete circle at each other is appropriate for TFTS...",

We made most of our money working for locally owned businesses. A lot of the time I was replaying hardware, doing basic networking, etc. That day I got what turned out to be the second most awkward service call of my tenure there.\n\n\n$me - /u/fatherfatpants\n$dl - receptionist\n$lawyer - head of the practice\n\n\n$lawyer calls us up to do a keyboard replacement. Apparently $dl’s keyboard is typing random characters. Being the lowest guy on the pole I get sent out. I get there, do a little swap, and everything appears to be good to go. I have $dl test it out, dropped the invoice, and left.\n\n\nAbout an hour or so later I get call from $dl that it’s doing it again. I go back, check everything, swap keyboards again, and head out. Later I get a very angry call from $lawyer.\n\n\n$lawyer (angrily): I just heard from $dl again and she says it’s still not working right. How many times are you going to come back and try to fix this?\n\n\n$me: I’m sorry that it’s sill giving $dl problems. I’ll come back and watch to see if i can figure out what’s going on.\n\n\nDrive back (thankfully being fully local has its advantages). $dl stands up to give me room to work but I had her sit back down and tell her to keep going about her business.  She spun around and started typing out this and that memo. Immediately I see characters on the screen that didn’t make sense and quickly figured out why.\n\n\n$dl is a bit of a vain person. Always dressed to impress, etc etc. $dl also seemed to have a bit of a vision problem. $dl is also quite busty.\n\n\nRather than wear glasses or turn up the resolution $dl would lean over her keyboard to see. Turns out she had a pair of helpers trying to bang out those memo’s too.\n\n\nI move her monitor a bit forward as a stop-gap and go talk to $lawyer. In an effort to avoid any undue accusations I explain the issue to $lawyer and ask her to explain what’s going on to $dl. $dl apologizes for being so rude and sends me on my way.\n\n\nMoral of the story: sometimes it’s what’s right in front of you that you miss.\n\n\nEdit- tiny grammar thing that was bugging the hell out of me.",

        "text": "Possibly my longest story on here, sorry, but I had to vent...This is a safe place right? surrounded by friends and peers?\n\nBit of set up...\n\nSo, I have Web Designer friends, they're lovely, but I have a gripe with the Web Design belief that they need ultimate control of DNS for their clients.\n\nYes, a website uses DNS for one 'A' record, perhaps a few more than one for certain reasons, and maybe an 'AAAA' or 'CNAME' if they're feeling spicey. And yes...the most interaction most people are going to knowingly have with DNS is by visiting the website.\n\nBut...\n\n...We, people, the glorious IT community, need more access to DNS management than Web Designers could possibly imagine. And when Web Designers decide to change DNS entries, or perhaps, migrate the domain to a different registrar without pre-warning, bad things can happen.\n\nMy story starts now...\n\n$P: Me\n\n$C: Client\n\n$W: Web Designer\n\n&gt; $C : Hey, $P, HELP! Our emails don't seem to be coming through\n\n&gt; $P : Okey doke, let me take a look, might just be a SMTP delay somewhere, bear with me.\n\n ... a few minutes fault finding ...\n\n&gt; $P : Um... $C, has anything happened with your domain name recently, it seems your DNS record for Email flow...isn't there any more...\n\n&gt; $C : Oh, yeah, $W moved it to a new registrar *to save money on the web hosting blah blah blah....*, but that was just for the web site, we haven't moved our emails. \n\n&gt; $P : Ah, I see...and you're right, your email service is still in place, but by moving the DNS registration, and not copying across the previous entries, the \"signposts\" for where you mail needs to go don't exist any more...etc.etc.\n\n&gt; $P : We need to put those MX record back in place ASAP the details are [**details**]. Can you forward this to $W please?\n\nNow, fortunately, this part was relatively well handled and was soon resolved....but...\n\n&gt;$P : Hey $C, MX records back in place, phew, mail should be OK now. That's the emergency over with, but we're going to need a few more DNS entries added, i.e. 'A' records for VPN access, SPF records for mail security etc. Could you forward these [**details**] to $W please?\n\n&gt; $C : Will do!\n\n$C also copied in $W so I can liase directly with them\n\n&gt; $W : Hey $P, that's done now, should take effect in 48 hours\n\n$P : Thinking ^48 ^hours? ^FFS, ^I ^know ^how ^DNS ^works, TTL is set to 60 mins, so will actually only be 2 hours.\n\nIt's also the Friday afternoon, so 48 hours would translate into Monday morning.\n\nSo a weekend happens, I get frantic calls Saturday morning where people are unable to use ActiveSync on their phones nor connect via VPN. I sort out alternate DNS entries using my own domain that I control and get the guys working again.\n\n**Monday Morning:**\n\n*nslookup tests to check the status of the subdomains and other A records*\n\n&gt; $P : Hey $W, could you check the DNS records I sent on Friday are set correctly? They don't seem to have propagated yet.\n\n&gt; $W : Yep, they're there. Log in and take a look, here's the [**login details**]\n\n*eyes roll, if I was a malicious person that would have been a mistake...*\n\nI log in and find...this isn't the DNS console, this is the Website management cPanel...but...with website \"Subdomains\" set up for my requested A records - subdomains that are just vhost records for using a different site on the web host. Not DNS.\n\n&gt; $P : That's not the DNS management, do you have any login for [**DNS registrars website**]?\n\n&gt; $W : Oh yep, you'll need these [**details**] for that\n\n.\n\nI log in, ^^DNS ^DNS DNS MANAGEMENT ^MANAGEMENT ^^MANAGEMENT WooHoo!\n\nWait...the requested 'A' records are set....under...the...TXT record fields? Cr*p, by this point the TTL had reverted back to 24 hours so any changes are going to potentially take ages.\n\n\n\n&gt; $P : [*sternly worded explanation of the reason why things were not resolved the previous week and begging to change the DNS management password (so only I know it) so this doesn't happen again*]\n\n\n\nDNS records corrected....a few hours later things start kicking back in, crisis averted!\n\nI have no idea how $W managed to set the MX records correctly but be completely unable to set any 'A' records....which is what they are going to need when the website is live!\n\nIf this was just a one off I'd be more chilled but no, enough is enough, we must rise up against this kerfuffle and shame these Web designers til they are afraid to even utter the words \"Domain Name System\"\n\nNote: Normally I do have full DNS control of my clients DNS, often shared with the owner of the business themselves, but this case was one that the client believe the web designer is king of DNS. This experience has taught them otherwise...\n\n**TL;DR: Web Designer moves DNS registrar, fails to set correct DNS entries twice. The second time makes sure it's in place by doing it incorrectly in two different places. Then proceeds to provide login details for the wrong control panel**",

What kind of things is she going to be using the laptop for?  \n\nQueue the usual few minutes of discussing what she would be needing, probably ending on me suggesting a particular model from a brand with a 2 letter acronym (which was the best balance of specs v price v build quality that I would have had in stock at the time). Customer is sounding happy with my suggestion...\n\n&gt;$me (internally): Sweet, Looks like I have a sale here!  \n&gt;$cust: So apparently these laptops have battery in them, how dose that work exactly  \n&gt;$me (internally): Oh crap....  \n&gt;$me: Yes they do, it means you don't have to have it plugged in to power to use it  \n&gt;$cust: So it never needs to be plugged in then?  \n&gt;$me: Not exactly, the laptop will need to be plugged in from time to time with the supplied charger to re charge the battery  \n&gt;$cust: But it has a battery right?  \n&gt;$me: Yes......  \n&gt;$me (internally): ????  \n&gt;$cust: so it should just always work without being plugged in then?  \n&gt;$me: No, the battery won't last forever, it will need to be recharged at some point  \n&gt;$cust: So what's the point of the battery?  \n&gt;$me: It means the laptop can be used without being plugged in  \n&gt;$cust: So she could do something like leave it plugged in overnight so she can use it during the day?  \n&gt;$me: Yeah that would work\n\nAt this point i'm not going to explain to her how the battery might not last all day, how you can use it and  charge it at the same time etc, etc\n\n&gt;$cust: Well thanks for that, I'll let you know If I want to go ahead with it  \n&gt;$me: No problem, if you have any more questions please feel free to call back  \n&gt;$me (internally): Please don't.....  \nclick.  \n&gt;$me: ???... Well.... At least she didn't ask exactly how long a full charge will last....\n\nTo this day I can't understand how this customer couldn't understand how a battery works, surley she must have come across a battery at some point?\n\nOh and in case you where wondering, she never brought the laptop from us (And never called back, Phew!)\n\nTL:DR \"What do you mean this battery isn't a magical infinite source of energy!

There was very explicit intructions ***Do NOT install 3rd party software on this machine*** on engraved placards on every tool in every fab I worked in.  Bad things would happen, the least of which would be the tool would be down and so your line would be down.  \n\nSo right before this happens, there was a big scare where someone at one particular fab had accidentally put a virus on a different companies' tool because he forgot to follow protocols.  The manglement at the fab, in all of their collective wisdom, decided that all tools in their fab needed AV software installed.  So the onsite tech (from the fab, not one of our techs) installs the AV software.  To their surprise, the tool stopped working.  \n\nTo a reasonable tech, this would be a warning not to continue on.  Not to this bozo.  He then installed the AV software on the second tool of it's type.  That one is now offline.  I can just hear the tech saying, \"Whoa, must be something weird going on, let's see if it will do it again.\"  Right before installing it on the third and final tool of it's type **in the whole fab**.\n\nNow we get a call from our call center that the fab is down because our tools have taken a dump.  We are jumping through our own butts to get over there and figure out what has happened.    We then had to explain how and why it was their fault, and that if they wanted it fixed faster than the 1 day turnaround specified in the contract, they would have to pay to have a courier fly out with newly imaged drives for each machine.  They tried whining and bitching but our boss stood firm so they had to pay. Lucky for them we were able to pull off the configuration files with all the robot and imager parameters so we didn't have to spend a whole extra day to align everything.\n\nTL/DR:  Customer breaks 3 machines by doing the same thing to each one seeing if they get different outcome.",

His main complaint is that he can't get it to charge.\n\nHe says he's tried a different charger, tried using his charger on a different computer and it works for the other computer.\n\nI agree to take the computer from him for a while and work on it when I get the chance. When I get back to it, I decide to try one of my chargers and see if it works. I take a look at the charging port - to see if it's the MagSafe 1 or MagSafe 2 adapter, and I notice that it's oddly shiny around the edge of the port. Like someone scratched the paint off.\n\nA little bit of a closer look, and lo and behold the magnetic port has decided that it wanted the company of a stray staple, which fit so perfectly inside the port that it looked like it belonged there.\n\nPulled that out and it starts charging right away.\n\nTl;dr: If your MacBook won't charge, it may just be trying to resolve an iron deficiency through its charging port.",

        "text": "I briefly worked at a tech repair store while I was in college.  Lots of people expected us to guarantee fixes before they handed over their devices, but policy said we couldn't do that.  We didn't charge customers unless their devices were fixed anyway.  Normally, I worked in the back doing the repairs, but sometimes I had to talk to customers at the counter when no one else was available. \n\nThis is the story of the worst attempt at repair I've ever seen.\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  Can you fix water damage?  I dropped my duffel bag in the pool when I was on vacation, and my phone and laptop were in it.\n\n&gt;**Me**:  Why don't I take a look and see what we can do.\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  I have a powerpoint for my job on my laptop, it's not backed up anywhere else, and I need to finish it for a presentation tomorrow.  You need to fix this.\n\n&gt;**Me**:  I assure you that we will do our best to try and get your laptop and phone working again.  Do you have the items on hand with you?\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  I have them in my suitcase.  Look, I really need you to fix them.  I have a presentation tomorrow.\n\n&gt;**Me**:  Can I see the devices? You can put them on the counter here.\n\nThe customer opened his suitcase and upended it over the counter.  Pieces of plastic, shards of glass, and a few keyboard keys fell out with the remains of a laptop and what I assumed used to be a partially melted phone.  This wasn't water damage.\n\n&gt;**Me**:  Could you walk me through exactly what happened?  I need to know what I'm working with here, so if anything occurred after your things fell in the pool, it would help if you could tell me.\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  I dropped my duffel bag in the pool, and my phone and laptop weren't turning on.  When I got home, they still weren't working!  So I put them in the microwave to dry them out fast.  My laptop barely fit, but I made it fit.  The microwave turned out to be TOO hot and the plastic started melting, and there was smoke.  Oh, and the microwave broke.  It stopped suddenly and it hasn't worked since.\n\nI was stunned.\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  I had to use a fire extinguisher and wait for everything to cool down before I tested it again.  But they still weren't working!  I don't know how the water could be in there after all that, so I put them in the dryer on \"low heat\" so the plastic wouldn't melt this time.  But then the screens broke, and the keys fell off because the dryer spun too fast.  I need you to fix all this, and I need it done in two hours from now.  No, one hour.  I need all the time I can get.  And if you don't do it, you'll be speaking to my lawyers.  I have a presentation tomorrow, and I could lose my job if you can't follow through fixing my laptop.  And I need my phone to call people.\n\n&gt;**Me**:  Hmm.  I see.  Let me get my manager.\n\nI paged my manager to have him deal with this, because there was no way I could, and he had a special way of dealing with rude stupid people.\n\n&gt;**Manager**:  What happened here?\n\nThe customer retold his story, and emphasized the importance of his presentation, now giving us only forty-five minutes to fix his things.  Not recover his data.  Fix *everything.*  Unmelt the plastic, glue the glass back together, stick the keys back on,  get the scorch marks off.\n\n&gt;**Manager**:  There's no way in hell we can fix the hardware, but we can still try data recovery.\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  *shouting* Look here, I said I needed it fixed! I don't want data recovery!  And your employee guaranteed it!  If I have to buy anything new, she should pay for it for lying!  I'll speak to my lawyer about this!\n\n&gt;**Manager**:  You broke your own s***.  Did anyone ever tell you not to put metal spoons in the microwave?\n\n&gt;**Customer**:  Why the hell would I put silverware in the microwave!  That's stupid!  You and your employee could be jailed for making false claims!  I have a presentation tomorrow!  You need to fix things NOW!\n\n&gt;**Manager**:  So you won't put a spoon in the microwave, but electronic devices MADE WITH METAL are fair game, huh.\n\nThe customer looked taken aback and swept his pile of junk back into his suitcase using his arm.  He threatened legal action again while leaving.  Naturally, nothing came of his threats.  And I had to clean up the glass and plastic that had fallen on the floor.",

        "text": "Ok everyone, hop into the wayback machine with me and join me in early 1997. I'd only been on the job for a couple of years and was teaching in a really crappy career college, as well as doing support for the staff (hey, why hire a sysadmin when we can just pull one out of the classroom whenever we need something done?).\n\nOn the day in question, I got called into one of the boss's office complaining that he's having a problem with his CDROM drive. He says he's inserted multiple CDs and he's been unable to read, or even eject any of them.\n\nAfter explaining that, in my experience, there is no way to accidentally insert more than one CD into a drive, he's still insisting that it's what he's done.\n\nNow, this was in that brief period when some manufacturers were making trayless CDROM drives, similar to what you see in cars, so there was no way to pry the tray open (there being no tray). I hit the eject button a few times - nothing. I straighten out a paperclip and insert it into the \"eject hole\" - nothing (no resistance either... feels like there's nothing in there, which would agree with what Windows had to say).\n\nAt this point I'm thinking I'm going to have to take the lid off this drive to get these discs. Out comes the screwdriver and I take the case off the computer. As the case comes off, a CD falls out. Three more are inside the case too.\n\nTurns out, instead of putting the CDs into the slot, he was sliding them into the gap between the top of the CDROM and the empty 5 1/4\" bay above it. A little pointing, and judicious application of scotch tape, and the problem was resolved.\n\nThe best part is that I had brought the class with me for this job. You may be pulling me out of class, but I'm still going to teach your paying customers.\n\nTL;DR: User puts CDs into the computer case, not the CDROM drive and gets schooled in front of my whole class (his customers).",

Most of the employees use a web based program that we can refer to as CC from here on out. I'm sure most of you get it, but to get to the program you have to go through a web browser, type in the address and log in.\n\nWell I guess this could be our fault for trying to make things easier, but when we set up the computers for users we leave a shortcut on the desktop that will lead to the CC log in, instead of them having to call us because they forgot the URL. Well, because of this several users believe that CC is a software installed on their computer, and they don't realize that they are in fact just using a web browser. (I know it still puzzles me) Well this is a quick story of that confusing situation.\n\n\n$ME: yours truly\n\n$CL: clueless lady\n\n\nI get a call early in the morning.\n\n&gt;$ME: Good morning helpdesk.\n\nLiterally screaming into the phone.\n\n&gt;$CL: WHY DOES CC KEEP OPENING UP WHEN I OPEN A NEW TAB???\n\nIt's 7:30 in the morning and I still hadn't had my coffee, I just muted the call for a second and let out a quick cry.\n\n&gt;$ME: What do you mean CC is opening a new tab?\n\n&gt;$CL: When I am on CC and want to open a new tab it just keeps showing another CC. Why does this keep happening I need to get to yahoo, and I don't know how.\n\nSometimes on IE it will just keep opening up a duplicate when you open a new tab.\n\n&gt;$ME: Just try closing IE completely and then go back in.\n\n&gt;$CL: I'm not using IE I'm using CC, I just told you this.\n\nI hate people so much, I just send a remote invitation so I can just connect and show her.\n\nI explain how CC is just a website, and that she is in fact using IE in order to get to CC so when that happens just close it out completely and go back in.\n\nShe then starts trying to tell me how that isn't secure, and that anyone can have access to the Claims that we deal with.....\n\nFirst of all, you have been working here 10+ years and just now realized you are using a web browser with something that you stare at for 40 hours a week.\n\nAnd second of all, you have a log in for a reason. They will only be able to get into CC with the correct credentials.\n\nLastly, you are not even able to get to the log on screen unless you on the network either inside of the building or using our VPN.... \n\nSo please just leave me alone.",

        "text": "[**NOTE:**  I feel a little weird about anonymizing this as the story's well known--it has actually been published with names and all, but in keeping with TFTS's rules I'll do my best in keeping to pseudonyms.  If the mods are okay with it, I'll provide a link to the published version.  AG]\n\n#Dramatis Personae\n`$Customer` - *the increasingly irate person at the other end of the line*  \n`$Me` - *as well, me, /u/goretsky*  \n`$TheBoss` - *the founder of the Scottish-Sounding Antivirus Company*  \n\n#Prelude\nI grew up in the 1970s and 1980s in Silicon Valley, consumed by a passion for technology.  This led to my discovering 8-bit personal computers (Commodore PET, Apple II, Commodore 64, etc.--this will be important later on) .  Later on, in high school, I discovered modems, which lead to me dialing into various bulletin board systems (BBSes) and discovering that nascent, pre-Internet electronic world out there.\n\nOne BBS that I frequently called was acquired by `$TheBoss`.  Being a user on it, I got to know him a few years before he started his Scottish-Sounding Anti-virus Company while I was in high school.  `$TheBoss` had appeared on local TV news a couple of times talking about computer viruses.  Being 19 years of age, a fast typist (I'd previously worked as a medical transcriptionist for my father's gastroenterology practice), and with no career prospects to think of, I asked him for a job.  He accepted, and herein lies the tale of my first day on the job in September of 1989 at what would become the Scottish-Sounding Antivirus Company.\n\n#Day One\nMy education began that day at `$TheBoss`'s kitchen table, with him drawing boxes in a line on a piece of scratch paper.  `$TheBoss` explained that each box represented an instruction in a program, and that a computer virus could either:\n\n*  **overwrite** a program (`$TheBoss` drew different-colored boxes over the beginning boxes), making the original program file non-recoverable  \n* **prepend** its code to the *beginning* of a file (here `$TheBoss` drew different-colored boxes in front of a line of boxes to show how a virus concatenated itself to the beginning of file)\n*  **append** its code to the *end* of the file (which actually started with `$TheBoss` drawing a different-colored box at the beginning of the line of boxes, and then a bunch of boxes at the end, along with some flow-chartesque lines and arrows showing how the virus added its code to the end of the file, but then prepended a far jump instruction at the beginning of the file to load the appended viral code,  after which the virus passed control back to the host program)\n\nNow equipped with the knowledge of how computer viruses infected files, I was ready to begin my career doing tech support.  \n\nThe single phone on the corner shelf next to the kitchen table rang, and I picked it up.  And here's how that call went:\n\n`$Me`: \"Good morning, `$TheBoss` Associates.  How may I help you?\"  \n\n`$Customer`:  \"I have a computer virus.\"  \n\n*I look at`$TheBoss`, he looks at me, gives a nod*\n\n`$Me`:  \"I can help you with that.  What file is infected?\" \n\n`$Customer`:  \"Your software says I have the Pakistani Brain virus in my floppy disk's boot sector.\"  \n\nOkay, this is where things get fun.  Remember what I said about using 8-bit micros like the Apple II and C64?  Well, the thing about those old computers is you'd turn them on, and they'd power up and you'd be sitting at a BASIC prompt with a flashing cursor, at which point you'd type a program in, or more likely, load and run a program from a floppy diskette or cassette tape.\n\nWell, the original IBM PCs had BASIC in a ROM chip and they'd load that if no diskette was present, but later models (as well as IBM compatibles) had to first boot from a floppy diskette in the A: drive with MS-DOS¹ order to get to a DOS prompt.  As a matter of fact, floppy diskettes for PCs needed both a boot sector (a snippet of code) to begin loading the operating system's kernel files.  Without the files, the boot sector would just error out and display a \"Non-System Disk or Disk Error.  Replace and strike any key when ready.\" message\n\nA process I was completely oblivious to.\n\nFor the next couple of minutes, I tried asking `$Customer` in various ways I could think of what the name of the infected file might be, so that I could them to just delete the infected file.\n\n`$Customer` was quite insistent that no files were infected, and that it was the boot sector that was infected with the Pakistani Brain virus.  \n\n`$TheBoss` just kind of sat there off to the side.\n\nAfter several rounds back and forth with no progress.  I looked at `$TheBoss` and gave a kind of helpless shrug and gave a \"you wanna take this call\" motion with my hands.\n\n`$TheBoss` nodded.\n\nI asked `$Customer` to hold for a moment while I transferred them, and passed the handset to `$TheBoss`.\n\n`$TheBoss` the tells `$Customer`:  \"The boot sector's infected.  Copy the files off the diskette and reformat it or throw it away.\"  Makes a couple of \"Mhh-hmm\" noises and hangs up.\n\nAt that point, I'm looking at `$TheBoss`, and he's looking at `$Me`.  I'm thinking to myself, \"*OhgodohgoditsmyfirstdayonthejobandI'vealreadyf*ckeditupandhe'sgoingtofiremeandI'mnevergoingtohaveanotherjobever*\" and just about to burst into tears when `$TheBoss` grabs another piece of paper\n\nand draws a circle  \n\nand another circle inside of that one  \n\nuntil it's a a series hand-drawn circles, concentric like an onion  \n\nand then `$TheBoss` says to `$Me`, \"Okay, this is a disk, it's divided up into tracks, and each of those tracks into sectors, and the very first sector is a boot sector...\"  Basically, explaining how floppy diskettes and hard disk drives are laid out.\n\nAnd that's how learned of floppy diskette boot sector viruses, a threat that would last throughout the DOS era and not begin to diminish until Windows 95 began to displace DOS and Windows 3.1 on the desktop.\n\nFunny thing is, there was a bit of a resurgence in this old viral technology with the rise of **bootkits** a few years ago, sophisticated rootkits that started by replacing the boot record on hard disk drives with themselves.  I'm glad I knew what boot sectors were, so I could explain how these worked to co-workers and customers.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n\n^¹ ^Or ^PC-DOS ^for ^IBM, ^DR-DOS ^for ^Digital ^Research, ^etc.",

You may have seen my previous post on here - this is the same guy!\nTo sum up quickly, we're in the process of updating everyone (when we get a chance) to Office 2016 from 13.

Yes...\n\nSo my manager goes over as he's out the office to check on his monitor (we had the MD chase us about swapping out his monitor - but we thought we had already) and whilst he was over there he started the upgrade of Office as we explained to him that Office 2007 was now a security risk and needed to be updated. The upgrade was then passed onto me to just complete finish. I remote in to take a look at how far the installation has gone and update the MAK code etc. Once completed I give him a call just to let him know that everything is OK and walk through a few things with him...\n\n*ring ring....*\n\n&gt;$inept: hello, *company name* $inept speaking... how can I help?  \n  \n*(This user always does this - like he doesn't know it's me calling... even though we have phone software that tells you who's calling)*  \n  \n&gt;$me: hi, $inept, just to give you a call to run through this office change and make sure everything is OK  \n  \n&gt;$inept: to be honest I don't know why you've done this? I was fine the way I was before and I don't like change. You know I don't like change... so why have you done this?  \n  \n&gt;$me: $inept, I understand that you don't like change and will find it a bit different but it's company policy that we make sure software is up to date and not providing a security risk. It is something that unfortunately we have had to do.  \n  \n&gt;$inept: Can you say 'I'm calling to give you a courtesy call'  \n  \n$me: *I laugh because I thought he was joking and continue to explain the software*  \n  \n&gt;$inept: *Interrupts me*: Say it...  \n  \n*(May be a good time to tell you guys that I've lost my voice and I am finding speaking on the phone for this amount of time now hurting me)*  \n  \n&gt;$me: 'I'm calling to give you a courtesy call...'  \n  \n&gt;$inept: Say it with some meaning  \n  \n*thinking to myself:* Why would I have to say it with some meaning? I don't work in retail?  \n  \n&gt;$me: I'm sorry I just feel a bit under the weather this morning  \n  \n&gt;$inept: QUICKLY then. Show me how to use this as I have things to do  \n  \n(He doesn't, I know what his search history is like) - thing is he's related to the MD    \n  \n&gt;$me: No worries. I've setup the view just like you had before on Outlook and all your headers still contain the same items (etc.etc.etc)  \n  \n&gt;$inept: Alright, whatever.  \n  \n*hangs up phone*  \n\nI do like my job, but it really does take some self restraint to bite my tongue and not react...\n\nEDIT: Just some formatting fixing\n",

        "text": "So my father-in-law was using a dongle for his internet, and long story short, it was disconnected. He lives on our property, so I offered to connect his laptop up to our WiFi. Hardly a generous offer as all he does is flick between eBay and emails.  \n\nAnyway, he accepts and I ask for his laptop. He insists you can't unplug it! Sure, you're old, it's fine... I unplug it, it shuts off. Confused, I pick it up and realise damn thing doesn't even have a battery. I'm somehow not surprised as this laptop looks so old and unloved (covered in years of gunk and dust) I'm not even sure how it still lives.  \n\nI give it a quick clean as the amount of dust accumulated is a little gross, and it's a wonder how the keyboard doesn't stick the keys down.  \n\nSkip to simple connection to our WiFi, give him back the laptop, he's very grateful. Less than 5 minutes later I receive a phone call asking how to connect the internet. I explain...  \n\n&gt;**Me:** You shouldn't need to connect, it's will connect automatically.  \n\n&gt;**FIL:** No, it's just a picture of my friend Janet (his wallpaper). Normally it's the internet!  \n\n&gt;**Me:** Yes, just click on the browser.  \n\n&gt;**FIL:** There is no browser, only something called recycle bin, ( list other icons) and Google Chrome.  \n\n&gt;**Me:** *confused as he has used the internet frequently* Yes, click on Google Chrome...  \n\n&gt;**FIL:** Single click? No, that didn't work... **double** click... White screen... YES! Thank you!  \n\nA bit bewildered, it takes me a second to realise... he doesn't know how to open a browser. He has been using this laptop and the internet for *years*. He's never even closed the thing in all that time, explaining all the dust and grime build up.  \n\nI knew he was old, but yikes.",

        "text": "Continued from: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7uy48d/the_soup_and_coal_debacle_part_1\n\nI stood on the rooftop as the winter winds ripped across the shopping center. The wireless network contractor stood beside me, surveying his work. Eight bespoke distributed lighting controllers sung along in concert, taking network time information, and determining the proper moment to send forth their legacy control data, now hardwired into each individual group of light fixtures. The retrofit appeared to be a complete success. \n\nBut let’s rewind several weeks…\n\nThe distributed control system was in the early stages of development, but it would provide the ability for the client to monitor and control the installation in the same fashion as the previous system. We had moved to the 5ghz band to mitigate the interference issues which the site management was unable to control. The weather was frigid, with ice covering the adjacent river, but no matter how many soups were ordered in the restaurant, our mesh network could not be disrupted. \n\nOur departing managing director did not always acknowledge when we were out of our depth in terms of technology implementation. I sought to mitigate that with this new system. We hired a networking firm which confirmed our findings about the unsuitability of 2.4ghz communications in this environment. They had provided a modern mesh network, operating at a higher frequency, which would provide for the monitoring and control functions for the distributed system.\n\nAs the controller firmware was developed, we gradually brought end user functionality online. More and more functions were ported to the user facing website, and the system seemed to be coming together. Once these devices became stable, we began to monitor the hour to hour stability of the system. We began to notice a worrying trend, the location above the sandwich chain which had caused so much headache had begun to act up again. Every couple of hours, this node would disconnect, and leave this location inaccessible from the remote control system.\n\nThe implementation of the new control system was critical. The client was relying on our new control architecture to resolve the intermittent function of the system, and we did not want to let them down. The problem occurred in the same location that we assured them was causing a problem with the previous system, and seeing issues reoccur here was troubling. We questioned our internal assessment of the original interference. We resolved to send a team to discover the source of the disconnections.\n\nWe arrived on site with our monitoring gear, sniffing the airwaves for any interference, but the spectrum appeared clear. We restarted the node, and everything began operating properly. The networking contractor arrived, and we ascended the snow covered roof of the sandwich shop, ready to intercept the rogue device which would foil our plans. Fog poured in off the river, as the sun melted the solidified precipitation on the landscape. We monitored the VPN, seeing each lighting controller dutifully report in every 60 seconds. Minutes became hours, and the pings came back consistently. \n\nCar tires hummed in the background, and the strums of barge horns echoed across the river. We had begun to question our sanity, as the node stayed connected. Then, the ping of the controller meters away from us began to tick up past the rest, and not stopping. Our technician on the ground reported no interference in the spectrum, but alas, the receiver had disconnected. The mesh networking contractor scrambled with his laptop, trying to ascertain the issue until we finally saw the root cause, floating in the river. We could only see the conning tower, floating above the mist, but the impression of motion was undeniable. The rectangular radar reflected flits of sunlight off its white skin as it spun, mocking us from afar. \n\nWe called into a friend at the local lock, queuing the coal barge traffic as it passed through, several kilometers down river and it matched perfectly. Dozens of minutes after the barges cleared the lock, a disconnection occurred. This building was the only one which had a node within line of site to the river, and the surrounding buildings and river wall blocked the radar completely. Only this unfortunate parapet was susceptible. \n\nWe managed to convert this location to use a point to a point transmitter, and were able to get end user functionality restored. The client was satisfied, and we learned several good lessons about the pitfalls of dealing with wireless communication.",

        "text": "Ted was a coworker of mine, an inept technician with the dumbest ideas. Today's tale is about the biggest mess he has ever made and the one that ultimately led to his firing.\n\nTed was working on site that day and he had no tasks for the afternoon. DumbClient had a few obsessions, one of them being removing unnecessary software from computers. We did that mostly by remote access, but some computers needed to be rebooted on site as they were connected to sensitive equipment, so someone had to be physically there in case something went wrong.\n\nI told Ted to go to a specific department that had a few of this computers, and told him to check them for \"unwanted software\" (think games, antimalware software, etc). The rule was that if you didn't know what a software was, you didn't do anything before quadruple-checking. \n\nAn hour or so later Ted phones in and I take the call. He asks if I know of a software called Spymeter (that's not the actual name, I made it up). I told him no and I looked it up on Google, which he could have done himself, but whatever, it's Ted. Spymeter is a software that collects and logs data from a piece of equipment, which has to work within specific parameters. If the parameters are not correct, the software sends an alert to whoever is in charge to fix the problem and logs the data for record-keeping purposes (sorry this is vague but I can't be more specific).\n\nSo Spymeter is not unwanted software, I'd say.\n\n*drumroll*\n\nTed says he already uninstalled it. \n\nCue the shitstorm.\n\nI think I lost my shit for the first time at work. Basically he had removed a vital software that was a legal requirement for the equipment to work. There was now no monitoring and no active logging, potentially meaning the loss of ISO-9000 standards and lots of other Very Bad Consequences.\n\nAfter verbally kicking Ted's ass and sending him home for the day, I kickstarted all the emergency procedures, emailing my CEO and supervisor, the Client, etc... it was late so nothing happened until the morning after. As soon as I got in the office, the head of the department whose machinery Ted just screwed up called my help desk. Andy took the call and transfered it to me (ah, the joys of being the boss!). Department Head chewed me out and I could do nothing but apologize and assure him we would fix the problem, but boy, I was about to cry. It was bad. I wanted to kill Ted with my own hands. \n\nThe rest of the day was spent with my CEO and the Client freaking out, Ted being whiny and bitchy all day, and me and Andy doing our best to do damage control. Ted was hellbent on fixing the problem himself, I told him that he if he so much as tried to get in touch with Department Head, I would fire him on the spot (I couldn't do that legally, but the threat was enough to keep him away from the disaster area). In hindsight, I should have let him talk to Department Head, because he would have gotten chewed out even worse than I did. But I digress...\n\nAndy and I handled the incident like bosses: we got in touch with software supplier, coordinated everything to allow their staff to log remotely into the computer and reinstall the software and doing everything they needed to restore the software and the data (luckily it hadn't been lost, though now there was a 2-day gap in the log).\n\nClient was very thankful, CEO gave me and Andy an extra day off and a gift card as a reward and Ted was written up.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nTed showed up in the office with a lawyer without warning a few days later, leaving us without on site coverage. I was called into the CEO/CFO office and basically Ted told everyone it was my fault because I specifically told him to uninstall Spymeter. It took all of my willpower not to laugh in his face: my boss had drilled the importance of CYA into my head, so I had a printout of all the incriminating emails exchanged between me, Andy and Ted, where it was crystal clear that Ted was at fault, not me nor Andy. In one of these emails he was even trying to trick me into asking him to resign, which is a big no-no in my country. \n\nLawyer apologized, Ted left and was fired that same day. Labor laws in my country impose a notice period for firings and resignations, so Ted had 2 weeks left before what would be his last day. He chose to forfeit his notice period, paid a fine, and he disappeared off the face of the Earth. A few months later, another coworker (from HR) saw him shooting at a range and another saw him working at a petrol station off the highway. We joked that he was either planning to blow the office up or kill us all with his rifle. Jokes in poor taste maybe, but we were a small company and Ted had effectively ruined everyone's work life for way too long and we had to blow steam off...",

It's about a 4-5 layer deep array containing file names, section names, etc. One of the items is a label name. I go and edit this for one of the entries in the FAQ array as it doesn't quite follow the title of the page. Upload to FTP and... nothing happens... I shift-F5 because sometimes JavaScript is a jerk and... nothing happens... okay so I ensure I saved the document and re-upload and... nothing happens... shift-F5 again just to be sure and... nothing happens... great... why?\n\nWell after some investigation I find out why. This person who questions everything too much had been asked to change the order of the FAQs in the page. So he goes and copies an entire section of this 4-5 layer deep array and just pastes it in its new location. Doesn't delete the other element, just keeps it. He does this for two or three other ones as well. Now I realize that the item I am editing is getting overwritten by an entirely new section of the array. No wonder it wasn't changing.\n\nI wonder why he doesn't work for us anymore. Couldn't possibly be the lack of quality code.\n\n**TLDR: Programmer is asked to change the order of an array and just DUPLICATES the items in a new location and doesn't remove the old ones.

        "text": "Just happened a few moments ago. Every time this coworker has to ask me something, I take a deep breath and get ready for whatever ridiculous conversation we're going to have. Last week one of my coworkers took over the company's twitter page. I emailed him the username and password which everyone can find from our database but I was trying to make it easy for him. I'm surprised it took a week for something like this to happen.  \n \n\n$coworker: Did you change the password for our twitter account? I tried logging in for an hour this morning!   \n$me: No, why would I do that?  \n$cw: I can't log in.  \n\n$me: OK, well I didn't change the password.  \n$cw: Well, you sent me the email with the account info last week.  \n$me: I did, I just coped it from  our database which *everyone* has access to. If you can't login, you can ask for a password reset and then go talk to $othercoworker who controls that email. It's easy.     \n$cw: Yeah, but you sent me the email with the login.  \n$me: Yes, that's true. But I don't have access to the twitter account email. Go talk to her.  \n$cw: Why would I talk to her? You sent me the email with the account information.  \n$me: Yes, but if you can't log in, you should try to reset or recover the password. An email will be sent to the email account associated with the twitter account. I don't have access to that email, but $othercoworker does. Go talk to her.  \n$cw: But you sent me the original email!  \n$me: I **don't have** access to that email account.   \n$cw: Yeah, but you sent me the email, can't you just give me the password?  \n\nThis went on for a few more moments until he finally went over to my other coworker who was 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) away. The problem? He wasn't typing in the right password. Only 3 days until I'm on vacation.\n\n\n",

        "text": "It's Monday morning, what do my users want to complain about today? Here's three short ones:\n\n1. Director of Marketing has raised a Priority 1 ticket (which warns you before you submit that P1 is ONLY for company-wide outages, as it pings alerts to all IT staff) because \"ALL the wi-fi is down.\"\nWe investigate a bit further, wi-fi seems fine. Marketing Director narrows it down to \"no wi-fi in the boardroom\". Seems fine there.\nHe claims \"no-one can connect\".\nOf course, it's just him. He's set his wi-fi to be controlled by the Intel driver instead of Windows. We set it back, suddenly it connects and all is well with the World.\n\n2. Another P1 call. Manager of a team of ten has decided that we should drop everything to investigate why \"SOMETIMES MY PRINT JOBS TAKE LONGER THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S.\" (Yes, all in caps).\nA brief look shows she's printing multi-page reports, and all her staff regularly print single page shipping and despatch notes. I explain not only why this might take longer for her, but also why this is not a priority one call. \n\n3. Field Tech manager arrives at my desk at 9:05am. \"Hi Jeff, I've got a new starter today. Sorry I've not submitted any of the forms, would you be able to get anything ready for him today?\"\nWow. I'm already snowed under, but I agree to have a look for something for him. He needs a laptop, phone and iPad. I have none of any of those in stock. He comes back to my desk with the new starter. \"We've got a flight to catch at 2, how's that kit coming along that I asked for?\"\nIt was all I could do to not yell directly in his face. I explain calmly that it will probably be Thursday before I can get anything to him - given time I need to get an order signed off (something he should have done in advance) then the order placed, delivered, configured and sent out. He's not happy. \n\nScrew this, I'm going out to lunch.\n",

        "text": "Not ‘actually getting paid for tech support’ guy here again. Just doing whatever needs to get done to keep my nightshift from crashing and burning, or grinding to a halt. \n\nThe distribution center (DC) I manage is staffed with a generally technically illiterate populace. They all seem smart enough to use FRUITphones but struggle with much else. The basic procedure in this DC is that equipment operators line product up in front of the dock doors and employees with laptops and scan guns mounted on carts check the product by scanning all the UPC and serial numbers into a manifest. \n\nMy nightshift sees me coming in after the shift is underway so it is not unusual to walk into some sort of problem. On this lovely evening coffee in hand I am informed by the STUPERVISOR that the system is down. I can’t connect any of the laptops for the checkers. FRUITSOFTWARE isn’t working. \n\nRigggght. So without a chance to drop my lunch bag at my desk, or even put down my coffee I mosey up to the nearest cart to talk to checker FOXTROT. FOXTROT is an older gentlemen who is retired but works this job to keep busy. I have immense respect for him because he has enough chronic health conditions to justify retirement but works because he likes too. Also FOXTROT has excellent taste in sports teams and is an educated fan of pugilism like myself.  \n\nME  \"Hey FOX what happened?\"\n\nFOX  \"I don’t know man haven’t been able to log into FRUITSOFTWARE since I came in. I almost drop my coffee as I come in an two hours after STUPERVISOR and an hour after the checkers are supposed to start working.\"\n\nI can see FRUITSOFTWARE running on the office PCs so that is clearly working, I try to connect once or twice before popping up the wifi settings on the laptop. Immediately the issue becomes clear even for me. We have multiple wifi networks in the DC. Three of them are equipment specific and entirely internal. The fourth is an internet portal GUESTWIFI, which is setup for clients, dealers and employees to use.  Somehow the laptop connected to GUESTWIFI. Since FRUITSOFTWARE is entirely internal the laptops can’t access it. I boot them off the GUESTWIFI, and get them sorted, making sure that the proper network is specified as preferred before heading into the office. Once inside I figure out pretty quick what caused the issue. There is some specific equipment that is always on unless there is a power outage and it needs to restarted, it was of course powered down. My guess was as the networks came back up after the outage the laptops grabbed the first one they could find and connected to GUESTWIFI. I opened a ticket put all the info in it and requested that #Head of IT have a minion go through the laptops and make sure they could not connect to anything but their preferred network. \n\n\nTHE NEXT DAY: The plot thickens\nIt happens again but this time only on WITCHY’s laptop. WITCHY is a pain in the neck on a good day so STUPERVISOR has switched them to another laptop.  Once again I sort out WITCHY’s laptop and back to work. Same issue, same fix.  Over the next week it happens again and again at different times. WITCHY’s laptop just seems to want to be connected to GUESTWIFI. On about day three I get curious and pull up the browser history on WITCHY’s laptop and low and behold. Somebody is surfing the internet every day at work. I open a second ticket explaining that some of the employees are deliberately changing the network so they can surf the web.  HOIT sends a minion down to pm the laptops, and then proceeds to remove permissions from everybody. I have a very stern conversation with my checkers about using the laptops for anything other than their jobs. WITCHY insists, despite all the evidence, that someone else is trying to get them fired.\n\n\nA WEEK OR SO LATER:\nI am making my way towards the office coffee in hand and I run into FOXTROT\nFOXTROT \"Hey man you know the score of the game?\"\nFOXTROT is normally on top of this sort of thing, but I am happy to chat show him some highlights on my phone.  After a little chatting I begin to get suspicious as FOXTROT seems surprisingly interested in my ongoing laptop struggles.\n\nME  \"FOX were you using the laptop to check scores?\"\n\nFOX \"Yeah, I saw you fix them started switching back and forth on my downtime.\"\n\n  From here I was able to gather that the other checkers had seen FOXTROT surfing the net and the word had been passed around. Apparently the only one who could make it work consistently was the 70 year old man who loved sports.\n\nEdit1: Oh god the formatting!\nEdit 2: Slightly improved formatting",

Fortunately, we provide computers (well, for the most part - I'm trying to enforce this across the board with support from one of the managers, but another still permits employees to use their own for development).\n\nOn the bus in one morning last month, I get a Slack message from $salesguy:\n\n&gt;$salesguy: morning $me, my iPhone isn't syncing my calendar or anything, it's giving me &lt;some weird, unintuitive error that I can't remember&gt;.  \n&gt;$me: hmm, I've never owned an iPhone [I use Android] so I don't know what that error means. can you try removing your work account and re-adding it?  \n&gt;$salesguy: okay, I'll do that, thanks.\n\nI hear no more about this until I get into the office, where I find $secretary on the verge of panicking.\n\n&gt;$secretary: $ME! YOU'RE HERE! OH MAN, I CAN'T GET CALENDAR EVENTS ON MY IPHONE AND $CEO HAS LOTS OF MEETINGS TODAY AND... &lt;breathe, lady!!&gt;  \n&gt;$me: whoa, okay, so $salesguy had exactly the same error, okay it's either an iOS problem or something to do with our cloud setup, and I'm leaning towards the latter... let me dig into this...\n\nWe use Google Suite for everything. This does actually work extremely well - it's an impressive setup for business use and minimal fuss. The first thing I notice is that everyone who's on Android has a working phone, but people with iPhones are locked out. I log into GAdmin and start poking around - I'm still relatively new with cloud-hosted business software so I don't know the in's and out's.\n\nSure enough, after a few minutes, I find an option, Apple Push Messages. Seems that GSuite has to communicate directly with Apple to send anything to iOS. Wouldn't you know it, there's a requirement to have a certificate pair here, and of course, `Expiry Date: &lt;the day before&gt;`. The certs have a 12-month lifespan.\n\nThere's a Renew button, which takes me to an Apple page, and the first thing I notice, it's pre-filled the Apple ID for my colleague, who's currently in a meeting, and obviously it needs his password. Rarely do I get such an opportunity to interrupt a meeting, so I slip fairly innocuously into the meeting and show him the page, get him to enter his password and voila, new certificate generated, saved, uploaded and imported into GSuite in seconds. After a few minutes, all the iPhones start syncing again.\n\n&gt;$colleague: oh right, that, yeah, I meant to make a note of the expiry date somewhere... guess I forgot...\n\nAfter announcing the source of the problem and that it's fixed on Slack, I get a thorough round of thanks from $secretary who is now able to stop hyperventilating. And I also stick a reminder in the company shared calendar with a week's warning for next year!",

Well today the tickets were all the usual \"phones have no dial tone in these rooms\" I was working on one room where the wire between the panel and the room had gone bad, so I was testing all the open pairs on the block to find a good one. Basically I was standing at an open panel in the hallway working through a tangle of wires. And a younger looking guy and his young son walk by.  After that were a little ways past me I hear the father say to the son, \"that is an ancient skill, not a lot of people know that anymore. Not because it is hard but because nobody really needs to know it anymore.\" Anyways it took about 2 hours to get that phone line worked out and it was all worth it because of that moment. A little commedy gold.  I had always considered the analog phones dated but never ancient. ",

I pulled out our help document and started talking them through the process. I'm saying something like \"So in the top left corner of the screen in the default mail application there's these 3 orange lines. Touch those and a side menu should come out. One you're there there will be a gear on the side menu to click.\"\nThey got the menu opened, but say that they can't find the gear so I try again. \"It might look like a flower?\" They don't see that either but apparently there's some kind of clock without hands so I tell them to click that but nothing's happening. They get sidetracked and need to reschedule our call for tomorrow morning.\nAt this point our troubleshooting doc is all text instructions for android, but I decide this guy needs pictures. I spent an hour going through print screens from start to finish on my phone, adding some earlier steps to get into the email application and highlighting important areas with red boxes.  \nThe next morning I send the document link so they can open it up and follow through the steps. So we get back into the app again and I start my three line spiel and they're like \"my screen doesn't look like this one.\" Initially I'm assuming it's because it's a different version of the app but eventually talking through with them the only difference between his screen and the doc is his screen doesn't have these red boxes around the buttons! Eventually we got passed this and set him up but I never thought that would need to be explained to someone.",

        "text": "This didn't happen to me directly, but to a coworker of mine.  Still, I felt the need to share it with y'all.  (By the way, this is my first post, so please, if I make any mistakes, have mercy on my poor soul.  Also, I'm an AV technician, so technically I don't work in IT.  I hope this story is close enough to fit in here, though).\n\n\nI work at a college with campuses in distant locations that we sometimes interact with via video conferencing or webcasting.  One such campus, which I'll call the NowhereVille campus, is so off-the-map that there are only a few faculty/staff members there, on a rotating, part-time basis, and the place is often quite deserted.  (Note: they only work there part-time because they're at our main campus most of the time).\n\n\nUp until recently, we had a VC unit in the NowhereVille campus conference room and it was set to auto-answer calls.  That way, whenever we needed to connect to that room so people there could participate in a meeting at our main campus, all they had to do was turn on the monitor, adjust the volume to their liking and voila, the set-up was complete.\n\n\nHowever, the VC unit was getting old and needed to be replaced.  Since my department couldn't get the money approved for a new unit, we decided that when the room was upgraded next, we'd retire the unit and use webcasting instead.  The upgrade came and went, and soon the conference room was equipped with the same webcasting software we use at all campuses and the room standardized to match every other conference room on the main campus.  \n\n\nOur users, who had used the same software and media elements in the conference rooms at the main campus for years, should have been able to run this conference room easily, with no learning curve whatsoever.  Still, we decided to contact them before their meetings, at least in the beginning, to let them know the room had been upgraded, and to run it like any other conference room.  Things should have gone off without a hitch.\n\n\nHowever.\n\n\nSoon, we're getting calls left and right from people who can't turn the monitor on, can't remember their passwords for their accounts, can't join meetings, don't understand they need to use the keyboard and mouse, etc.  It seems like everyone and their grandmother has suddenly forgotten how to use a computer and/or TV remote.  We get people requesting/demanding we drive X hours to the NowhereVille campus to help, as if we could ditch our regular duties for an entire day just to sit there while they reset a password.\n\n\nEventually, after much coaxing, prodding, reasoning, bargaining, and exasperated, off-call fuming, the panic dies down and our users more or less realize that yes, we really meant it when we said this conference room is like all the others.  Finally, things are business as usual.\n\n\nThen one day, several weeks later, my coworker gets a panicked text on his cell phone (a big no-no--our users are supposed to call the department's number, not contact us directly).  The text said something to the effect of, \"Help!  I have to join a meeting RIGHT NOW and all I'm seeing are these pretty pictures on the screen!  The pictures are popping up and then going away!  NOTHING I try is working!\"\n\n\nHe shows the rest of us the text and we talk about what it could possibly mean.  Since some time has passed since the initial flurry of confusion, we wonder if there's a bigger issue at hand.  Perhaps she's getting an endless stream of popups. \n Maybe the computer has a virus.  In the end, we figure it's probably just a matter of user error.  We decide to wait it out, since she didn't call the department extension for help, anyway.\n\n\nSure enough, my coworker soon gets another text that says something like, \"Nevermind.  The pictures went away.  I joined the meeting.\"\n\n\nHe later gets in contact with her and asks about what happened.  From what we can surmise, the lady walked into the conference room, turned on the monitor, saw a screen saver, and panicked.  Instead of jiggling the mouse on the table or trying literally anything at all, she panicked and texted my coworker.  The screen saver likely went away when she bumped into the table and the mouse shifted, hence the second text.\n\n\nTLDR: A user sees a screen saver, immediately assumes something is wrong, and breaks our rules and sends a panicked text to a technician on his cell.  Sometimes, \"nothing you do is working\" because you are literally doing nothing.",

        "text": "For reference, I work at a community college as a SysAdmin, but I occasionally help out when things get busy for the desktop guys.\n\nSo we're in the middle of a massive lifecycle push with our faculty.  They're each given 4 options of upgrade.  One of which is a [tablet-style computer](http://store.hp.com/wcsstore/hpusstore/Treatment/elitex2_calloutBanner_1000x560_new.jpg), with a Thunderbolt dock.\n\nThis Physics faculty-member in question is always about the latest and greatest, so I'm not surprised when he picks out the tablet.  \n\nI image the machine, configure it to his particular needs, and shoot him the email letting him know it's ready, and to back up his data, then to let me know when he'd be available for me to stop in and swap the unit in for his old laptop.  He gives me his office hours, and to stop in whenever.  We make the appointment for a Tuesday at 11:00 AM.  \n\nSo Tuesday comes, I load up a cart with a monitor, keyboard, mouse, Thunderbolt dock, his laptop and a backpack (as he's turning in his old rolling laptop bag), and his tablet.\n\nHis normal building is under renovation, so his current office is literally in the basement of an admin building.  I head in, take the elevator downstairs, go down a fluorescent-lit hallway, and at the very end, sandwiched between two storage rooms is his office.  I knock on the door, and it opens into a room that's filled with 3 old desks, a few metal shelves, and like 5 file cabinets.  Poor guy has Milton's office from Office Space.\n\nSo I get to work pulling his old dock and equipment, running cables, using tie-wraps to gather everything all nice and pretty and prop the tablet up.  I plug everything in, fire the tablet up...and I get zero power running to the mouse and keyboard.\n\nIt's picking up the ethernet connection, monitor, and it's charging.  I try plugging the mouse and keyboard into different ports on the dock, directly into the tablet, and nothing's working.  I re-install the drivers. Nothing.\n\nI grab his old dock and hook it up to all the new equipment, plop his laptop in the dock and fire it back up.  Everything works.\n\nOkay.  Maybe it's the dock?\n\nI run back to the stock room, and run back with a new dock in hand.  No bueno.  \n\nBy this point it's about 12:30, I've got another appt at 1, and I still haven't had lunch yet.  I tell him I'm going to bring the tablet back to my office and do some more troubleshooting.  Get back to my office, wolf down a quick lunch, and head out to the next appt, who ends up no-showing me.  So I go back to my office, hook the tablet up to the dock on our bench, and everything works fine.  No issues whatsoever.  He's not available again for another week, so I re-image it just to make sure, run all the updates on it, and again verify it works with the dock.\n\nNext Tuesday comes, and I take the workbench dock with the tablet this time, because I know it works.  And guess what? It acts up again.  Same issues.\n\nJokingly, I tell the Professor that it must be the room.  As he's laughing about it, I pick up the tablet, and the keyboard comes loose and stays down on the wood veneer on the desk top.  I look at it for a second, and pick it up.  It puts up a fight, but it comes up. I laugh.  \"No way\" I say, opening up the desk drawer.  Which is metal. I feel around on the underside of the desk, which is metal.\n\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\nI look around the room, grab a ream of paper, set it on the desk.  Propping the tablet up on it, I hook it up to the dock and reboot it.  \n\nVoila.  \n\nMy guess is the magnets were engaging through the wood veneer to the steel, and messing with the sleep function on the tablet, causing the mouse and keyboard to not engage.  I show him what I've found, and with a little bit of regret tell him he'll either have to leave the ream of paper there, or come up with a different tablet stand if he wants to use the tablet.  Luckily his building is coming back up in a few weeks, so he'll be out of that office, but we'll have to add another question to users if they choose the tablet option.  \n\n**Do you have a metal desk?**",

        "text": "After 5 years of desktop/helpdesk support, I have a few stories, mostly short, but I just remembered this one from my first year, which was a doozy.\n\n\nBackground, the company I until recently worked at provides various IT support for mostly smaller companies.  This one particular client is what we called (not sure if industry term) \"break-fix\" meaning they paid hourly rates for helpdesk or desktop support at a higher cost compared to regular clients.\n\n\nSo client company works in a Window environment with their own domain server at the time.  Employees are assigned computers while interns bring in their own, and there are no spares available ever (this is important later).  Policy is to bind interns' computers to the domain to give them greater access.  (This is years ago; we forced better security later on, I had no say in this, please dont hate me!)\n\n\nSince interns are usually fresh out of college (or still in college), they tend to have either Macs or Windows Home edition and everytime we need to explain to client company that the interns need to upgrade to Windows Pro to join the domain (client: **grumble**, cost, **grumble**).\n\n\nWhile not a client I liked (at all), things were fine until this intern whose Windows is not only Home, but in Korean.  One of their employees knew Korea, but we're in America, so everything else at client is English.  The intern wanted to comply or appease the client company so we had to get the laptop in English.  Ugh.\n\n\nTo speed it along, I spent a lot of time on this, but it was my first year or two, and despite getting some settings to be in English (to the point I could navigate the buttons by remembering where they are in English and the intern joking Im learning Korean), and attempting to download an English language pack, I learned the only option was to buy (client, **grumble**) Windows Ultimate to get English, due to Windows being cheaper in certain other languages and denying English.\n\n\nFor details I dont remember, this required a complete reformat of the computer (important for later) and even some hours with Microsoft support to get the laptop working correctly afterwards.  Eventually we get the laptop in English and able to join the domain, files transferred, everything cool, right?  No.  When it came time to reinstall MS Office, it turns out the key used was from the intern's former university and now no longer works.  So now client has to buy (client, **GRUMBLE!**) MS Office for the intern as well, but after many days, we finally get it working.\n\n\nBut there's more.\n\n\nI think within minutes of finishing everything and checking with the client if there is anything else, the boss of this small client finds out how much more this cost compared to other interns and yells at me why we didnt just use the laptop of an employee who had recently left.  The fact that said employee was still working at client when I *started* helping intern and the laptop (which should have been held in reserve for at least a month) was only available for a couple days before I finished was completely lost on them.\n\n\nAnd thus, cuz client company has interns provide their own laptops, most of which arent the correct version of Windows, and this one not in English, I was asked to never come back to this client.  Since my dislike for this client grew several times over the course of 1 week, I was happy to never go back there.\n\n\nP.S.\nDo not give a client your cell phone number if you can help it for ANY REASON unless as a low level employee you enjoy calls at 9pm from an intern.  =(",

Pretty much all they wanted was to move a user from one computer to another. This involved creating a new user account on the new machine, then copying over all the settings and programs. One of those programs was Outlook. \n\n-\n\nSo I setup this machine, it looked like everything was copied over correctly, and everything seemed to be working. A couple of days later I get a call:\n\n&gt; I can't log into my Microsoft account, but I've added my work account as a sub-account, but none of my folders are there. All the emails and contacts are there, just no folders.\n\nI asked him to describe the issue in email, and send it to me. I was out of the country at the time, and the issue didn't seem urgent (he could still work) so I said that I would come in when I was back and take a look. \n\n-\nI get into the office. He had tried to login with his work account, failed, and used his personal email account. Then added a new account, and successfully managed (this time) to put in the details of his work account.

He has something else to work on for a bit, so I take a look at his computer. \n\n-\nI look where the folders are meant to be. I look at the sidebar. It's collapsed. I click on the arrow, the sidebar opens. Lo and behold, the folders have appeared!\n\n-\n-\nTL;DR: User doesn't know how to use a sidebar. Waits several days.

I'd been into her computer remotely earlier (she's often out of the office) to access the $PITA_Accounting_Software server, as it had issues earlier that day. I'd forgotten to close the RDP window and it was still pointing at the $PITA server, which is really just a desktop VM.\n\nA quick aside about $PITA_Accounting_Software: $PITA_Accounting_Software all but refuses to function when setup as a true server, and needs a full install of the desktop application for the server functions to work properly. They actually encourage installing the application on the AD server, as with many very small businesses, that is the only server on premises. I'm not a pro, but I'll be damned if their POS software is going on my server as an application, hence the VM. /rant\n\nHow the hell $BD couldn't see that the big letters at the top of the popup didn't say rdp.$RSV.com but had an IP address listed is just proof of blonde-ness.\n\n$Me: \" That's pointed at the $PITA server.  Reopen the RDP window and use the dropdown to select rdp.$RSV.com, and it should have your login info saved.\"\n\nMind you, I have RDP and the connection to $RSV pinned to the taskbar for ease of use. And, of course:\n\n$BD : dead silence.... \n\nNo \"it's working,\" no \"Thank you,\" no nothing. It's bedtime, so IDGAF. Text notifications shut off at bedtime, so if she is still having issues I'll deal with it in the morning. \n\n\nI suppose I should look at the bright side, in that at least it wasn't phone call #217 about the POS consumer-grade printer that won't stay hooked up to the POS router her ISP setup at her home.  Which I only hear about after 7 pm on any given day after it has decided to drop its IP and need rebooted or occasionally reinstalled.\n\nI feel your pain, TFTS, I feel your pain.\n\n\n",

        "text": "First time posting here.  I used to work for a tech support company that provided IT and other services for clients who (usually) didnt have their own IT.  As a small company, my role bounced around between helpdesk and fieldtech/desktop support and more, as needed.  So with no danger to my former job, here are a just few short stories from a single former client (a construction company, if it matters).\n\n\n**Story 1:**\nWhen on-site, I had my own room, but it was shared with the servers, and thus loud fans (no AC tho), and laptop storage.  Still, the door was always open when I was there.\nThe CEO bursts in one day, drops his laptop onto the table from 1 foot up, and exclaims:\n&gt;CEO: It's broken. *Fix it!*\nThen walks away.\nInitially shocked, I stopped what I was doing and poked his laptop.  I think it didn't boot or something.  Within minutes, I reseated the HDD and it booted to Windows and logged into my account just fine.  After a few tests to confirm everything is fine, I then brought it to him.  I dont think he even thanked me for fixing it so fast.\n\n\n\n\n**Story 2:**\nUser calls in with an issue (I dont remember what) and needs me to remote onto her computer.  We installed {remotesoftwaretool} on all managed, client computers, but sometimes it breaks and they need to go to a website to allow us to remote on.\n&gt;Me: I don't see your computer in our remote software list.  I am going to need you to go to {website} so I can remote on.\n&gt;User: No, **YOU** need to go website to remote on!\n&gt;Me: Um, uh, Im afraid I cant do that.  I need you to the website first before I can even remote on...\nI've meet this user in person, and while not friendly, she isnt rude in person, unlike over the phone.  Calls like this made me do anything I could to help her remotely without interacting with her.\n\n\n\n\n**Story 3:**\nAnother on-site, a friendlier user had a software issue that would take awhile, so she l so left me her laptop and password, in case I needed it.\n&gt;User: Here's my password (on post-it).  Oh, and it's also my bank password, so don't abuse it.\nShe then left before I could respond.  I don't do blonde jokes anymore, but, well, you could guess her hair color.  Fortunately for her, I didn't even check which bank she uses and she also frequently changed her passwords.\n\n\n\n\n**Story 4:*\nOne of my first on-site visits, this time to a construction job for the internet being down, not the client's main office.  I do the usual of checking that yes, everything is plugged in, turned the modem and router on and off again, etc, but no luck.  So I have to call the ISP.  After over an hour escalating their support levels and their same tests, confirming they can't see the modem on their end either, someone I was transferred to the billing dept.  Finally we found the issue: the client hadn't paid the internet bill for several months and the ISP turned off their internet.  Again, a bit dumbfounded, as in all these stories here but I was able to laugh this time and said something akin to \"Really? That's been the issue this whole time? Ha! Well, I'll have to talk with accounting to fix this.  Thank you.\"\nThis issue happened so many more times over the ~3 years I was there that I lost count.  I learned to ask ISP support right away if there was a billing issue before working out the tech issue.\n\n\n\n\n**Story 5:**\nLast one, similar in a way to Story 4.  This one particular jobsite had multiple construction trailers and cables running between them.  Had to go out for the internet not working for the entire site.  Did the usual tests and unable to fix it.  Jump to the problem: one of the workers had *cut* the cable between two of the trailers.  For some reason, the ISP had to come out and run a new cable, but problem solved, lesson learned: Don't cut random cables, right?\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and same thing: I got called out for internet out, found another cable cut, had to call the ISP.  Ok, surely this won't happen again.\n\nSome days or weeks later, same issue, rinse and repeat.  However, this time we had to beg the ISP to come out and fix it.  Problem solved.\n\nAnd cue a fourth call for the same issue of no internet cuz a worker cut a cable (we are at least able to diagnose the issue faster), we managed to get the ISP out to fix it, but this was the *last time* they would fix it.  Fortunately, forth try was the charm.\n\n\n\n\nP.S., I apologize in advance if my formatting is janky.\n\n\n**Edit** part 2 https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7xubxq/more_construction_client_it_short_stories/",

No one can work!\n\nNow as a side note, we just put in a few new AP's about a month ago. \n\n&gt; **$Ofmiceandusers** Hmmm, that doesn't sound right but I'll go take a look. \n\nNow, I head back there and almost instantly, I realized the problem. One of the Medical Assistants had their mouse battery die. So, what did they do? Did they go and change the battery? Nope. They took every wireless mouse in the hallway (about 15 of them) and tried using them at their workstation, unaware that the wireless receiver was paired specific to one mouse and one keyboard. Users never know better. \n\nAfter pairing them all back up, I told $Braindead what happened and they about died laughing. \n\nBUZZ BUZZ.\n\nWelp another ticket, gotta go fix that!",

        "text": "Hey guys!\n\nGot a great one for Force-Choke Friday!\n\nSo, this entire week we have had 2 users, 1 super understanding and apologetic, the other super hateful about it, having issues with their passwords. \n\nThe first user, our lovely receptionist, has requested her password be changed about 3 times this week due to it not working. Today she calls, yet again, and states that she can't log in to her email or our company website. My coworker uses the temp password he gave her to log in and logs in to our company site just fine with the temp password and communicates to her that it is working correctly. EDIT: She was using the wrong password from her password book the entire time.\n\nThe second one, the guy has had his \"issue\" for about 3 weeks. Saying he can't log in to anything and doesn't turn his computer off due to not being able to log back in so he blames us for all the problems he has; not being able to log in to email, company site, doc control database, all because my coworker helped him once before. Yesterday, he complains once more and my coworker logged in with it just fine and communicated that to him. Today, the user complains YET AGAIN about the same issue. My amazing coworker goes over once more, asks for his password that the user swears up and down does not work, and proceeds to log in without problem with him standing next to him.\n\nTL;DR: One user is password challenged but friendly about it. One user is SUPER password challenged but hateful about it.",

(I might have some relevant stories from that branch to tell, over time, as long as they aren't covered by NDA.) This post is mostly for venting purposes, if it doesn't fit the sub, please delete it. \n\nMy coworker next to me has been in this company for quite a long time, and did networking and IT for a while. So he still gets requests from time to time, despite us having an in-house IT. \nLast week he had a fairly ancient 36 GB HP server HDD on his desk that decided to do its last twirl. He had to replace it with a used one of the same age, because of course there are no new parts available anymore, and of course one team relies on that server. At least the data was backed up, and they understand that he had to resort to used parts that might break sooner or later, and the whole server will hopefully be replaced eventually.\n\nToday another coworker came up to him, the computer from one of the first test benches of our site broke down. It's been repaired so often, that only the motherboard is still original. The whole thing runs on Win98 or Win2k because the bench needs the legacy software that never was updated. The guy who programmed it is probably sitting on a sunny island, enjoying his retirement. And of course this program only runs on ancient windows and technology. \n\nOnce again, the people who use it, understand the problem perfectly well, but it's only a matter of time until someone from lower management will not be amused.... It's not a critical test bench, but still gets used regularly. So my poor coworker will have to go hunting for a compatible HDD or whatever broke in that computer, dig out an image of that Win98, and get the bench running again for a while. ",

        "text": "Hey there, another quiet day, another story.\n\nSometime last year i got a call from one of our clients, $ReligiousOrganisationBasedInItaly, more specifically a shop attached to their main \"facilities\".  We are currently overhauling their entire network but this particular place has 3 or 4 (we're not even sure) consumer grade switches daisy chained together on two stories and nearly 80m of cable before they reach the main server. Which is about 30m from them but they don't want to drill a couple of holes for that.     \n\nAnyways, that particular morning i was alone in the office with the intern (who's mainly there for support, he takes calls when everyone's busy, but he's instructed to just create a ticket and tell the callers that we'll call them back) while my coworkers are on various sites installing switches, phones and whatnot. I'll be $me, the callers are $caller and $angry.    \n\n&gt;$me: Thank you for calling tech support, how may i help you?  \n&gt;$caller: Hello, we have a huge problem we have no network, our till is not working, we have no internet, no email and our network drives are inaccessible  \n&gt;$me: Let me check some things real quick *i ping the server, check the services, everything looks fine from my end*  \n&gt;$me: Hmmm, your server is online other connections seem ok, can you check the \"internet\" cables on your end if everything is plugged as it should?  \n&gt;$caller: Well, it worked yesterday and we didn't touch the cables *i can hear her whispering to someone* \"He's saying we need to check the cables\" the wifi works though  \n&gt;$me: The wifi works? *i know it's behind their wall and plugged correctly into a real switch, so there has to be something with their network*  \n&gt;$caller: Yes we can connect to wifi with our smartphones and with the only laptop we have here, but the other computers and the till are not working.  \n&gt;$me: Let's start by checking those cables do you have access to your switches?  \n&gt;$caller: *whispering* \"He says to check the cables, yes, no, wait\" Just a minute, my superior would like to have a word with you  \n&gt;$angry: *in a very irritated tone* Yes, since this morning we have no internet no network, no tills, nothing, i want it fixed ASAP!  \n&gt;$me: Yes i understand, but i know your network has some peculiarities and in your case it appears that a cable has been disconnected somewhe...  \n&gt;$angry: YES! I know it's a network problem, you people installed it *nope, they flat out refused that we touch their 10 years old crap in the shop* and you need to fix it, SEND SOMEONE!  \n&gt;$me: I understand your frustration but i am alone in the office and there are no available techs right now, if i don't manage to fix the problem from my end i'll get you one as soon as he's available. But we really should check those cables of yours because i know...*she cuts me off* are shit.  \n&gt;$angry: No, you don't understand, i have customers waiting, my tills are not working, i am losing money i need you to send someone in 15 minutes. *yeah right, her boss doesn't have that kind of contract with us and if we did we guarantee a tech within 4 hours, non 15 minutes*    \n&gt;$me: And i will send someone once we've identified the problem and if it requires a tech, but as i've said, i am alone in the office and... *cuts me off again*  \n&gt;$angry: I don't care, I AM LOSING MONEY!  \n&gt;$me: *this lady is starting to slightly irritate me* Listen, last time i checked i cannot multiply nor teleport, either we perform the troubleshooting right now *it's been 15 minutes already and nothing has beed accomplished* or you can wait for a tech, who most certainly will not show up in 15 minutes. It's up to you.  \n&gt;$angry: I NEED YOU TO SEND SOMEONE !!!    \n\nShe slams the phone down at this point.    \n\nI call one of my coworkers who's fighting with a weighting terminal not far for them and he's OK to make a detour to take a look.  \nOnce he's back, turns out those idiots managed to snap a cable by tugging on it with something heavy. They've also decided to move a computer in the till area and since there was no free ethernet outlet the $angry instructed the clerk to \"just unplug something from under the table\" which she did and guess what, yes, it was the cable from the tills.    \n\nOur boss decided to bill them the double, for my time and coworker's.",

        "text": "So I have this job as an on-the-field IT technician. I go to people's homes and fix whatever their issue in IT may be. The contract for this job is laid out in a way that I can accept or decline jobs/missions as I please (I think the English word for this is a suborder agreement). So it's good to have this job on the side while I study. To become, in all irony. An electrician. \n\nThe tale begins with this job I accepted: \"Customer has problems booting up computer, nothing appears on the screen when pressing the power button\". \n\nHours later: \n\nI arrive at the customer's home. She explains to me what the problem is and shows me the computer. I take a quick glance at the computer and then press the power button. The button lits green but nothing appears on the screen. \nSo I start fiddling around to try to see if there was a problem with cables connected to the PC. Seems fine, nothing out of the ordinary. So I turned the circuit breaker on and off. I then press the power button again. But this time it lits green and then after some second it turns off. Confused I press the button several times and the same results occur. After thinking if it's a software or hardware problem I come to the conclusion it must hardware. \n\nI open up the computer. Nothing out of the ordinary just a lot of dust. I got rid of the dust and looked at all the components. It looks fine, nothing has melted it doesn't look like something has actually overheated. \nI check the power supply unit and opened that up. Strange, nothing special there. No signs of it ever overheating. \nI put the computer back together. Turned it on same results as earlier. Lit green, shut down immediately. \nIn desperation I try everything, fiddling with cables, turning it on and off etc. To sound professional and to not admit I didn't know wtf the problem could be I said what first came to mind to the customer: \"There is definitely a problem with the power supply unit and you may have to replace your existing one with a new one. But I'll do some more looking just to be a 100 % sure\". \nThen.. I found this red switch. It hade two numbers. 230 and 115. It was turned on 230. And since I was desperate and came later to realize what this switch actually was meant for. I turned it to 115 and turned on the circuit switch but thankfully the power cord was connected to a \"branch contact\" (The kind you put in an already existing power outlet in a wall so more electronics devices can get power). I turned on the circuit breaker and proceed to walk to the branch contact and turn that switch on. \nThe moment I turned on the switch for the branch contact the PC short circuited and a loud fucking bang could be heard across the whole apartment. Well fuck, now there is DEFINITELY a problem with the power supply. \nThe customer rushed to me. Thankfully nothing happened to me. \nYou could feel the smell of burnt electronics from meters away. \nI said: \"Well, I think I was correct about the issue regarding your power supply unit. It seems that you have to buy a new one. I could come back and install the new one for you?\". She was happy that I found the \"problem\" and said she would call me during the week when she had bought a new one. \n\nOn the way back home still thinking about what actually happened. Thinking that it must had something to do with the red switch. I Googled it and learned that the red switch controlled the voltage for the PSU. And since I live in Europe and not the USA. That was probably the most stupid thing I've ever done. In this part of Europe in our outlets that's mounted to the wall. The voltage output is mostly 230v. \n\nSeveral days later I came back to the customer and installed the PSU. When everything was put together the moment of truth was here.. I turned on the power button. And to my surprise the windows logo appeared on the screen. She thanked me and I went home. Still wondering what the fuck happened. \n\nI have never told anyone the actual reason for that PSU to explode until now.\n\n\nTL;DR: I made someone's PSU explode and got paid for it.",

        "text": "Hey TFTS, LTL FTP I love this place, finally decided to post blah blah etc. etc.\n\n$Me - The best damn tech you ever did see\n\n$Customer - A small local business client\n\n$PopThief - Plays no significant role in the story, but is known next door by this title\n\nI'm tier 1 support at an MSP that handles mostly small local businesses. Even though I'm tier 1, if I have time, I'll take some more difficult tickets and try to fumble through them. Within reason of course, nothing time sensitive.\n\nAnyways, about 6 months ago when we still had our 2nd tier 1 guy, $PopThief, I had some downtime because we were light enough on tickets that he could handle all the new tickets solo. So I picked up a ticket from $Customer that said \"Can't view the company website\".\n\nWe recently had a little issue where a company blamed us for their site going down because they never paid to renew their SSL certificate. It's not important here, but the point is that I had SSL on my mind.\n\nSo I tested it from my computer, and was not presented with an SSL error like I thought. It's been a while, so I couldn't tell you what the exact error was, but I immediately started thinking \"Oh no, I don't think I can handle this, I don't know what to do if a website goes down!?\"\n\nI had tier 2 try it, and surprise surprise, they pulled up the site just fine. So I tried it on my workstation again, thinking it might have just been a temporary outage. Nope, still didn't work for me.\n\nOnce I contacted $Customer, they explained that it was just on this one computer that it was having problems. I tried everything. I reset, then straight reinstalled Chrome. Same with Firefox. I tried *all* the browsers. Nothing seemed to be getting blocked by the firewall, nothing else even seemed affected. Just this one website, on my computer, and their computer. This was a very simple setup, they had one modem/router/AP, and the only \"server\" they had was a workstation that happened to have a small file share. It was basically a home network setup, there was no weird DNS shenanigans that could be going on.\n\nAfter about an hour, I ran out of ideas. You know how I mentioned that I would bumble through more complicated issues? This is where the bumbling started. This is where I just started poking at things. I knew there was a thing called the HOSTS file in Windows, but all I really knew about it was that it had something to do with network connectivity and some malware liked to mess with it. I had already scanned for malware, but I thought I'd take a look anyways.\n\nTo this day, I have no idea what I expected to find, but I never expected this, and I really don't think I'll see it again. Inside that HOSTS file, I found one line. It went a little something like this:\n\n127.0.0.1 www.$Company.com\n\nImmediately, it *resolved* in my head what the HOSTS file is for. And everything made sense. Kind of. The problem made sense, but the \"how it got there\" didn't. Nobody at $Company would have the knowledge to put something in there, much less put anything that actually *does* something there. We kind of ruled out any malware, because the machine was clean (from the scanners at least), and because why would any malware know their company website, and ONLY change the company website? It had to have been put there on purpose, but who put it there, or why, will forever remain a mystery.\n\nI deleted the line, and everything worked just fine! Who would have thought that you didn't want to tell your computer to look on itself for a website?\n\nNow, there is one piece of the puzzle that I'm sure many of you other techs are wondering about. \"But, your computer couldn't pull up the website either!!\" Fear not! I'll explain it!\n\nAfter much debate, my whole company, minus the lady who works the front desk, decided this is what happened:\n\nFuck it, who cares, it makes no sense.\n\nI never figured it out, and that website pulls up just fine on my computer now.",

I was told I need flash?\n\nMe:  Ah, if they require flash, then it won't work on your iphone you'll have to do the seminar on a computer.\n\nFN:  Well they told me I need flash and some other stuff too.\n\nMe:  Right, well since the flash is a requirement, you won't be able to do it on the phone, you should be able to do it on any PC though.\n\nFN:  Hold on, they said I could use the iPhone, but that I needed flash and these other things.  (she swipes around on the phone, I assume looking for an email, she can't find it)\n\nMe:  Unfortunately because of the flash requirement, they are wrong about it working on the iPhone, Apple does not allow flash onto iPhones, so anything requiring it will not work.\n\nFN:  What about the other things they said it needed?\n\nMe:  They don't matter because, according to them flash is required, so it won't work on your iPhone.\n\nFN:  Well, that just doesn't make any sense to me. (and she left)\n\nThe other part of this is that she was asking about something I do not support.  Yes, I support her iPhone, but I don't support random crap she wants to do with it.  Some random education portal thinks flash can run on iPhones?  Good luck with that.",

        "text": "**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**$Selben** - Tier 1 tech support - earlier on in his career but totally ready to go that extra mile!\n\n**$Soda** - Tier 3 tech support / IT Manager and mentor of $Selben. Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Was the IT Director for a short time as $Company grew, but rejoined the ranks as the politics were not for him! Also an amazing friend! Also had a never-ending supplies of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!\n\n**$Genius** - A special team lead at one of $Companies locations - $Location71 specifically\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe last empty box was disposed of. The cool morning air helped to keep $Selben from sweating much, but he still looked bedraggled from the effort of bringing 40+ computer boxes out to the dumpster. Back inside, he slumped back down in his chair intent on returning to his normal duties. Before he could even open the managing tools, $Soda popped his head around the corner.\n\n&gt; $Soda: Can you ping $Location71?\n\n&gt; $Selben: Uh, I’ll check.\n\nNo response from the location. He shook his head no, but saw $Soda’s headset was lit up. He was on his morning conference call, so $Selben took the initiative. He tried calling the location, only to receive no response, including no voicemail. Checking the location's network history, it looked like they had been regularly going down twice a week for the past several months. He emailed the information over to $Soda.\n\n$Selben had returned to his regular work when he heard the jingle of keys. Looking up, he saw $Soda with his coat and big stupid grin.\n\n&gt; $Soda: Time to investigate!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey headed over in the van. The steady rattle of some loose tools in the back was only slightly quieter than $Soda chatting on about the new fondue maker his wife had just gotten, and all the different types of cheese you could melt in it. After a long drive, made worse by morning traffic, they arrived at $Location71. They walked up to the door and headed inside, observing everyone working, and everything appearing normal. The front desk who looked puzzled at their existence as they approached.\n\n&gt; $Reception: Welcome to $Location71. How can I help you?\n\n&gt; $Soda: We’re from the helpdesk. We saw you've had a few network outages recently, including one earlier. We tried to call but got no answer, so we came over to check it out.\n\n$Reception checked the phone on her desk, and opened a webpage on her computer. Everything was working fine. $Soda and $Selben went to check the network equipment anyway. Walking past the kitchen, they were pleased to note there was no longer a password on the wall, but instead a motivational poster of a puppy stretching. They opened the small walk-in cupboard where the network equipment was stored next to the kitchen. Coffee filters, snacks and some foam mats were also stored in the same space, which made it difficult to get inside. Naturally $Selben was sent in. After some dexterous movements, $Selben was able to confirm everything was fine. They headed out, not sure what to make of the downtime.\n\nThings went normally the rest of the week. $Selben checked on the location's network and saw no issues until Friday morning. $Selben was nursing a cup of coffee while reading his emails when on his second screen he saw $Location71 go down again. He stood up to tell $Soda, but he was already at the door.\n\n&gt; $Soda: Let's go!\n\nThey managed to get to the location in record time (it was Friday after all). Walking up to the door, they saw the lights were off. Trying the door, $Selben found it locked. $Soda pulled out his cell and tried to call $Genius, the location manager, but no answer. Noticing a donut shop across the street, they had a snack while they waited for some form of life to appear at $Location71. $Selben was puzzled by the whole situation, and even $Soda admitted he wasn't sure what was going on since the employees' cars were in the parking lot.\n\nThey scouted out the area for an hour before they saw the lights turn on and a receptionist unlock the front glass door. They headed back over to see everyone working, just like it should be...\n\nAfter ~~interrogating~~ asking $Genius what was going on from 7am - 8am, it was discovered the entire office had been doing Yoga / Meditation as a team building exercise twice a week for several months. However, $Genius was sick of phone calls and other 'auditory interruptions', so he had everyone unplug all phones, power down all electronics, including the router and switches, and turn off the lights. $Soda sighed, and recommended leaving at least one phone on in the event of an emergency, and to not power down the network equipment as it could cause confusion and many other issues for the company.",

        "text": "I do love my developers. Really. They are nice, they are fun to talk to and work with and they are clever.  \nWeeeeeell some of them are apprently more clever-ish than others. This is a story about those \"others\".  \n  \nLike everybody working in IT we have some common rules. Like \"Only IT Ops manages servers.\" and \"No company processes on employee workstations. Software needed for this has to be deployed to a redundant, IT Ops managed, system.\"  \n  \nWhy is this relevant? Read on.  \n  \nOur facility management announced in a location-wide mailing that 2 of our buildings would be made completely powerless due to necessary, by law-required, regular power supply tests and measurements. They also demanded that everything (PCs, Displays, TVs, Lights, etc.) has to powered off. So that the equipment isn't actually powering on after they restore power hence preventing short fuses.  \nThe buildings will be powerless for the better part of the whole weekend, starting friday evening.  \n  \nA reminder mail is sent at friday 5pm that everything has to be powered off by 8pm and I take it as the sign to pack my stuff and go home as I'm on on-call duty anyway.  \nAt 9pm I'm called.  \n  \n&gt; **Me:** Hello, you've successfully established a telephone call with /u/BarServer. What can I do to get your lovely voice out of my head?  \n&gt; **Colleague:** Hi, it's $colleague from the customer portal team. We noticed that product X is down for all customers. Our logs show no errors but we only provide the frontend, mostly we do API-calls to your middleware cluster TREX9000. Can you have a look if something is fishy there?  \n&gt; **Me (logging on to TREX9000):** Let me have a look. *mumble* Apache logs are fine. I see your requests. Error log is empty which is nice. mod_jk log is also only informational messages. Proceeding to Tomcat. *mumble* Hmmm. *mumble* Application is deployed on all nodes. Clustering works. *mumble* Oh! Here. It is trying to load an XML file called tariffs.xml from some other host which ends in an Connection timed out exception. But the hostname doesn't sound like one of ours. And why is the domain ending in .workstation.company.tld. What the..  \n&gt; **Colleague:** Uhm... I don't like where this is heading.  \n&gt; **Me:** Me neither. *mumble* Yep. IP is from the developer workstation network. Servername or ID not in ITIL CMDB so definetly not a server. Fuck.  \n&gt; **Colleague:** Can you drive to the office and power it back on?  \n&gt; **Me:** If I would know WHERE in the office building this workstation is located and there wouldn't be a location-wide power maintenance, maybe.  \n&gt; **Colleague:** Ok, I'll update our frontend to show the \"Sorry, this product is currently unavailable\"-page and inform our support techs. Also I'll get an incident manager onboard. You try to get as much information as possible and we call again in 15 via telephone conference, room 1337?  \n&gt; **Me:** Agreed. Thanks for taking care of that part.  \n  \n15 minutes later...  \n  \nThe incident manager joins us we brief him on the situation and our findings. It turned out that the developers have set up a Jenkins server on this workstation and somebody decided it's a good use for storing that file. Sadly, the firewall also permitted that access, as developers do have access to servers for deploying and troubleshooting. Another reason why they thought they were clever. As normally these setups won't work because of missing firewall rules OR when they really try to get these rules, these setups will be spotted by either an IT Ops admin or network guy who have to review these tickets prior to addition of the rules.  \nThe incident manager talked to the teamlead of the dev team and yeah.. It's a workstation under someones desks in an ordinary developer office. In a building that is powered off because of the maintenance. Hilarious!  \nTeamlead is absolutey stunned that 1 missing file/host can bring down an entire product. I just want to shout \"Software architecture! Do you even care!?\" in his face. Higher tiers are informed as some ten-thousand customers are affected. Luckily the most active users are on workdays between 9am and 9pm.   \nOne of the reasons why they decided to leave the maintenance running and leave the product down until Sunday evening.  \n  \nThe sweet part comes here:  \nThe development teamlead is ordered to drive to the office on Sunday at 8pm and power on the machine and having on of his developers verify via VPN that the jenkins server works and then call me and $colleague to verify that product X works again.  \nWhich means a 1 hour drive for the teamlead and extra worktime for the dev. \"Sadly\" I couldn't do this, as because of the maintenance, all electronic locks are down. And even then I couldn't get into the room as I have no clearance for this office to \"unlock\" it.  \nLet's say I rather enjoyed playing the \"I would. Oh I really would. If only I could.\"-part.  \n  \nLater it turns out that the tariffs.xml file has to be updated regularly. As it contains, well, our tariffs, promo- and discount-codes for that product.  \nThe developerers got tired of re-deploying quite fast, so they decided it's better to separate the XML file. Why they didn't automate this using, well.. A Jenkins server maybe? Is out of my mind. Setting up a pipeline for this is rather easy for them. But yeah..  \nAdditionally their teamlead did know about that and approved the plan. Which gave me some extra satisfaction. As it would have been his job to cancel this approach right away and have his developers set up their Jenkins on a server managed by IT ops. In one of our datacenters. With redundancy. AND spot the single point of failure they had created.  \n  \nSo yeah. This is what we did. And they setup an automatic deployment. You change the file tariffs.xml? Great. Rebuild the .war file. Deploy to QA, run tests. Works? Deploy to production. Profit and uninterrupted sleep for everyone! Yai!  \n  \nThis is the story of how I learned the importance of power maintenance to ensure software quality.",
