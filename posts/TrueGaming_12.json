        "text": "So I've been thinking recently. I have come to the conclusion that there are 3 root genres, some genres are subgenres, and some sub/genres are not even genres for games.\n\nThese root genres affect digital, physical, and mental games. Examples being Videogames for digital. Monopoly and Tag for physical. Ask 20 questions for mental.\n\nThe root genres are as follows: Puzzle, Strategy, Action.\n\nPuzzle games always have a solution. (Tetris does not)\nIn Strategy games you create your own solution.\nIn Action games there is never a solution.\n\nIn a way it's more of just thought. If you are looking for an existing solution, you are trying to solve a puzzle. If you are thinking of a solution, then you are thinking of a strategy. Whereas when you actively think in general, you are in action.\n\nThe act of thinking isn't a solution or a strategy.\n\nAs for genres being subgenres... the one I keep seeing brought up recently is fps. FPS is First Person Shooter. Shooter is already a genre. (Imo it is a subgenre of Action) Therefore FPS is a subgenre of Shooter.\n\nHere's one that I can finally murder in cold blood: Roguelike. Why have a subgenre (it gets called a genre) be based off a game? Isn't that limiting? I also think roguelites is a terrible name as well. There's so much controversy on this \"genre\". Well if roguelike is a subgenre, then what is it from? Why not make Rogue be the genre?\nImo Rogue is an action game foremost. Strategy 2nd. So all roguelikes are strategy and action if they truly were based on Rogue. But nah it's so loose. Roguelites being the loosest. So can we stop calling games, genres? Hero shooter was coined because of Paladins copying Overwatch. Hero shooter is just a shooter with \"heroes\". Heros are just classes. Why not call them CBFPS (Class-based First Person Shooter). Or CB shooter. Hero just sounds like you're saying Overwatch is the original because the classes are called heroes. Tf2 is older and its classes are called mercenaries. But does this really need to be a \"genre\"? If anything it's a subgenre. But again why make a genre be based off a game?\n\nThen finally you have genres that belong elsewhere. The big one being adventure. When you hear the word adventure do you think of a puzzle game, strategy game, action game, or a mix of them?... Adventure is a theme. Star Wars: A New Hope is an adventure. Some games have Adventure modes. Adventure is not a genre nor a subgenre of games.\n\nI'm mostly set on this so what do you think? Do you also agree that we need less roguelikes and more dynamic games in all genres?",

It is all I expected. I love it.

        "text": "**The Issue**\n\nIf you were to look at the reviews on steam of the Callisto Protocol, hell, lets not even limit it to the Callisto Protocol, let's expand it to basically every single game on the library. How many negative reviews do you see that are just 'plays like shit', or 'Got stuck,' or on the positive end 'I really loved this game.' 'Try finger but hole' 'haha bewbs', etc, etc, etc. \n\nHow exactly are any of these reviews? These one line, say nothing 'reviews' that explain nothing and yet can alter the rating of a game and ultimately falsely push away or pull in people who might have loved or might have disliked the game just because they saw a 'Mostly Negative' or 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating? The answer is, well, they aren't. They say nothing about the game, say nothing about gameplay, graphics, optimization and the like. They are pointless bloat liable to misleading people into buying or not buying a game.\n\nAdd on to these 'reviews' the ease at which the 'Common Man' can just upload a review and our seeming eternally tainted 'only black or white, nothing inbetween' culture. And suddenly you have a system liable to vast swathes of review bombs whose sole intention is to tear down a good game or prop up a bad one. And I absolutely abhor this.\n\nLike, I will go back to the Callisto Protocol as an example (which I will mention, I bought and played on the Xbox One and really enjoyed it,) at launch if you were to look at the game on steam, you would have been met with a mostly negative rating due to the (very reasonable) displeasure brought on by the poor optimization. Yet now you look at the game and what's this? It's at Mixed? But... but... the horrible Optimization!\n\nTell me, had the game come out with the optimization done right, would the game have ever been at Mostly Negative? Hell, would it even be mixed? I would say no. Chances are it would be at the low ends of Positive. But because there were the (justified) brigades of 'runs like shit' reviews, the game will now have to fight tooth and nail to get out of the gutter it's been put in. And this isn't the only one. It's just the most recent. All because you can just go onto steam, click thumbs up or down and type A SINGLE LETTER into the description, and your 'review' will be done and weigh just as much as the 1000 word essay someone spent hours working on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The (hopeful) Solution**\n\nThis needs to change. This system needs an overhaul to, not prevent, but disincentivize low effort positive and negative reviews and simply make it harder for review bombing to happen. Require a certain amount of WORDS. Not characters, words. 50-100 minimum and this would be your general opinion. Then include a checklist of thumbs up, thumbs down, and 'neutral' for all aspects of a game. Graphics, optimization, Controls, Story, etc, etc. Possibly include a text box for each of these asking 'Why did you enjoy/dislike the Graphics?' and do that for everything.\n\nNot only would these requirements make it more laborious, not overly so mind you, and perhaps it should be more extensive if need be, for these review brigades to happen. And (hopefully) only the people who actually want to spend their time reviewing something critically would actually go through the effort of spending the time to review games. Like this we could actually see the true quality of a game and not the say-nothing trash that infests many game reviews.\n\nNow, I don't mean to remove everyones ability to proselitize their opinions. Include another type of 'review'. A forum-like area where people can post just singular posts with their thoughts and opinions and all that but does not touch the actual penultimate review score. Ideally, I'd want something like a 'Community Opinions' section which just in brief describes issues / praise the non-review community would have. Maybe include another checklist or an algorithm looking for certain keywords. Eg, in this section you could see something like;\n\n***Community Opinions***  \nUnintuitive Combat  \nGamebreaking glitches *(hovering over or clicking on these could even link/filter through the Community Opinions to display the posts which include that topic. and)*  \nPoor Optimization  \nExtensive Open World  \nChallenging gameplay  \netc, etc, etc.\n\nWith these I think we could get a more trustworthy overview of the quality of a game whilst no disenfranchising the people who still wish to let their thoughts be known. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you think it's too easy for people to make reviews? How would you 'fix' reviews to prevent brigading and low quality reviews? I would love to hear what you all think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  \nIt's too easy for people to review games and for their reviews to affect the rating of said game.\n\nSteam needs to update it's review system.  \n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zcoxh8/does_making_a_narrative_choice_during_a_flashback/",
        "text": "(I didn't spoiler tag this because I don't get into any specifics, but if you're extremely sensitive about these things, I do hint at stuff from New Tales from the Borderlands, Dragon Age 2, and The Witcher 3, but nothing important)\n\nFlashbacks are tricky in story heavy games in general, because technically speaking, if the player has even the tiniest bit of agency, then flashbacks give us the freedom to alter the past. But I'm willing to overlook things like the order in which henchmen are killed or what barrels are destroyed as they don't have much impact on the story. But when you make actual story choices in flashbacks, that all breaks down.\n\nAs I'm playing NTftB, not enjoying it very much but feeling compelled to finish, there's a character with a traumatic event in her backstory that is left a mystery for most of the game. When she finally reveals it, she tells half the story then says something to the effect of \"and then I... \" and you're given a dialogue prompt to choose one of the four things that happened. This kind of thing drives me nuts. \n\nIt doesn't make sense to me that I could be able to make choices in the present that decide what happened in the past, so I am left to assume that none of these are what happened, and I'm choosing which lie this character tells. And then that doesn't make the choice very interesting to me. \n\nThe worst offender in this is Dragon Age 2, a game I otherwise adore (warts and all), because the entire story is framed as Varric telling Cassandra what happened in Kirkwall. So its one big flashback to events that have already happened. The game opens with a sequence that *clearly* establishes Varric as an unreliable narrator, and then you play out the whole game inside Varric's story. I have to conclude that Varric is the true player character, and by playing out the game, we're deciding what lies he tells Cassandra, rather than the actual events in Kirkwall. There could be an interesting game to make with this in mind, where we have to balance keeping the story believable to Cassandra while achieving whatever goals Varric has in spinning his lies, but DA2 isn't that game. It otherwise plays out like any other fantasy RPG, where you take on quests, kill bad guys, make life-or-death decisions, decide whether the stat bonus on these new shoes is worth the fact that they look stupid, and see the impact of your choices play out in subsequent events. But with Varric's framing device, on some level none of these choices matter to me. When I make a life-or-death decision, I'm only deciding whether this character dies in Varric's story, not in the \"real\" world of Kirkwall. And the impact of my choices similarly only exists in Varric's story. \n\nI've voiced this opinion before (mostly in the dragon age sub), and some people seem to play narrative games as if they're the writer, so this doesn't bother them. They aren't choosing what they would do, or what they think the character would do, as much as what they *want* the character to do. So having the powers of the writer means changing the past is fair game to them. But I can't be alone in playing these games as if I am the character I'm making choices for. Not always (but often) in a self-insert way, but certainly in an escapist way where I'm trying to take on the role of a character rather than having omnipotence in determining the past/present/future of the world (for the same reason, it bugs me when we switch between player characters, because I feel like I *am* the primary player character like Geralt, and then suddenly I'm controlling Ciri and I'm someone other than myself, but that's another topic entirely). \n\nFlashbacks in a narrative game feel like they're a holdover from other, non-interactive media, where they are helpful devices to inform us about the past. In interactive media like games, however, they seem like a paradox, unless used very carefully. Brief scenes where we don't make any choices. \n\nAm I in the minority on this? Or overthinking it?",

        "text": "When I first started playing The Witcher III a couple of years ago for the first time, I played it in Hard Mode, wherein I experienced a very memorable moment when I was doing the \"Wild at Heart\" side-mission, where I was looking to see what happened to a man's wife after she disappeared in the woods. \n\nNow, playing the game on hard difficulty and being very inexperienced in the game's systems, I have been barely surviving in the game. In hard difficulty, you don't heal when you meditate, and dying doesn't restore your health when you reload your save; you reload with the same amount of health you saved with. This meant that the only way I knew how to heal and survive was by eating food which I needed to get from merchants which was expensive. \n\nWhat would end up happening is that most quests I took would end up with me beaten half-way to death as I killed whatever needed to be killed, using up all my food to not-die, and after getting paid following the end of the mission, I would use up almost all the money to buy just enough food to fully heal me with a bit more food to hold me over for the next mission. \n\nAdding to that, when my sword broke for the first time brought even more stress to the situation since I had to put money that was for food aside to fix my weapons to be able to do the next quest successfully. I almost never had enough money to think about any other purchases like new weapons, armor, or gwent cards. Not being able to buy playing cards because of everyday expenses that includes expenses you need to consider because of your job hit a bit too close to home but it was simultaneously fascinating, partly due to the fact that your job was about monster hunting as opposed to mundane tasks, and also due to the moral quandaries that came with so many of those quests.\n\nAnd this brings us back to \"Wild at Heart.\" As mentioned earlier, \"Wild at Heart\" has you find out what happened to peasant's wife who disappeared one morning into the woods. You interrogate the wife's husband, sister, friends, and neighbors as you start to retrace the wife's steps before she disappear, until you get into the woods where wolves roam, and where the wife's sister confronts you and asks you to let it go and tell the husband that his wife died to wolves and she will pay you double what the husband was offering.\n\nI accepted her offer. I was not in the best of shape at that time, low health, no food and weapons almost broken, and decided to go with the morally dubious choice and let it go, lying to the husband. Even with the money that the sister was offering, I would be using it all up to get me back into fighting shape with only little to spare. So when I came back to the husband with the news, and he offered me the money he was also going to pay, and I saw one of the options being along the lines of \"No, I can't take it,\" and *didn't* choose it, instead taking his money after lying to him and already taking double what he paid from his sister-in-law, I was feeling exactly how the game wanted me to feel. I was making excuses to myself, saying that I needed the money and that the wife was clearly dead, and that finding out the truth would've just hurt them and possibly caused more death. \n\nI ate well that day with food and money to spare, with my swords in tiptop shape. But my choices have haunted me ever since and have changed my future choices too. Whenever future missions ended with an altruistic choice to leave the quest-giver with the money since they needed it, I found myself reflecting on the husband from \"Wild at Heart\" and taking that altruistic choice out of a sense of lingering guilt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I imagine many of you more proficient with the game than me (which admittedly isn't a high-bar) are already bringing up a multitude of ways to make more money, to get cheap or free healing, and to effectively kill monsters and enemies that I haven't been using in my time playing the game. And while that's not the point, you are right; I didn't even know what swallow potions were back then and I was a bit disappointed when I found out about them since from what I can tell you have an infinite supply of them. Whenever I was hurt, I would drink all my swallow potions and then meditate and get them back. That became how I played the game afterwards with no worry about getting food which broke down the delicate balance of the money-handling aspect of the game. Not to mention the utility of alchemy, armorers, and blacksmith, most of which I'm still not utilizing to the best of their efficiency to this day. \n\nI didn't get too far back then in the game, but I started a new save file recently on normal difficulty with a small self-imposed challenge to avoid using swallow potions or meditating when I have full health. I found it to still adhere to the experience I had when I played the game for the first time without strictly finding myself abusing the shield spell and sticking to passive strategies in combat. I got to \"Wild at Heart\" once more just last night and didn't lie to the husband or take anyone's money to the relief of my conscious  and the dismay of my well-being since I am now broke after betting and losing all my money on a rigged horse race.\n\nNever change, Witcher III.",

        "text": "First, let’s put aside the cash grab attempts by Square Enix.\n\nThe main criticism of Avengers is that it’s repetitive. I totally agree with that. But it’s a looter game, and every looter game is repetitive. In some genres like rougelike or sports, being repetitive is acceptable, and looter should be one of those genres.\n\nVideo games, at their core, are mostly repetitive. They try to hide their repetitiveness by giving missions a story, giving players more playable characters and powers, having more enemy variety, etc. Avengers does a good job with its story and playable heroes, even though the enemy variety could be better. \n\nDiablo 3 is a highly rated looter and it was considered one of the best games of the 2010s. Everyone who plays Diablo 3 knows it’s repetitive as hell because all you do is go from point A to point B to kill some monsters, loot some gears then do that again. But as long as the gameplay loop is fun, gamers don’t care. The reviews for Diablo 3 never complained about its repetitiveness. I just don’t understand why Avengers is bashed for its repetitiveness while Diablo 3 is not.",

        "text": "I have been playing a lot of JRPGs, metroidvanias, and action-adventure games, as these are my favorite genres. An issue I have been finding though is that many of these games can be very confusing and frustrating to navigate without a map. \n\nA perfect example is The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky games and both Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure. These games have a world map and a town map, but as soon as you get into dungeons - the main areas where a map would be very useful - your map goes away. So then I'm left wandering around and hoping I'm going in the right direction. Well actually, more often, I'm trying to find all the hidden treasure chests, so I'm trying to go off the beaten path and then get back on the path. It makes navigating every dungeon more confusing and annoying than it needs to be. \n\nHow about another example, where the problem is \\*so\\* much worse. Final Fantasy: The Four Heroes of Light. In this game, dungeons are a complete navigation cluster-fuck. They are massive and confusing and they have multiple floors. If you find a set of stairs, it leads into a room on the next floor. No it doesn't actually lead to the second floor though. Each set of stairs leads to a pocket area that can't be accessed from another set of stairs from the previous floor. One direction leads to a long winding area with more stairs that go up or down and then the next floor has multiple stairs that lead up or down. Every direction you go in leads to somewhere completely different and it diverges into more directions and more pocket areas. It is the most convoluted dungeon design I have ever seen. \n\nI tried making a map on graph paper for this game and it became so complex and confusing that it was unusable. I mean how do you track floors that lead up and down and then to pocket areas that then lead to more pocket areas? Without a map, navigation is a complete nightmare. It's made only worse due to the constant random battles and tough enemy encounters. So now you have no idea where the hell you're going and you are getting your ass beat. That was my experience at the 10 hour mark anyways. I completely dropped it and now I use it as an example of a game with laughably terrible dungeon design. \n\nNow some people will say that games shouldn't have maps because it takes away the joy and excitement of exploration. Or they'll say that it makes sense in the context of the story to not have a map because it's an area the characters haven't explored yet. To those people, I say I don't agree at all and that's a poor excuse. If anything, a map \\*adds\\* to the joy of exploration. It makes it easier to figure out where you've already been, where you haven't been, and what you're missing. This is especially important in metroidvanias because you almost always have to go back to old areas once you have new abilities unlocked. Without a map, it can be very confusing to and frustrating trying to remember where that area was that you couldn't reach before, but can now. \n\nI'm someone that likes to 100% games pretty often so I always intend to go for all of the extra secrets. This is so much harder and time-consuming and just not fun when there's no map to keep track of where I haven't explored yet. Trying to remember is hard, especially when you've taken a break from a game and are just coming back to it. Not everyone has the time or patience to blast through games so it's very likely that people will forget where they've explored and what they need to do. There are quite a few different games that are held back because of their frustrsting choice to not include a map. \n\nBlue Fire is the perfect example of a game that is completely up-my-alley, but actually playing it can be disorienting because there's no map to keep track of where I haven't been yet. It's an awesome action-adventure game with metrodivania elements and 3D platforming, literally all of my favorite genres rolled into one. It's just too bad that actually playing it causes me to lose my place and try to fumble around until I get to where I think I need to be. It just makes navigating less fun imo. \n\nNow, the game that really got me to right about this: Phoenotopia: Awakening. It's another amazing game that has exactly what I'm looking for: Zelda II-style action-adventure top-down overworld /side scrolling metrodivania exploration. The name of the game here is exploration. This game is fucking massive, for an indie game. There are tons of towns, dungeons, forests, and hidden areas. Navigating the top-down overworld is one thing - it's not too confusing because all of the locations are pretty distinct. \n\nBut once you get into a dungeon, the game has tons of diverging paths and doors to go through. So now you're dealing with multiple layers of 2D exploration. You can go left or right, up or down, but if you go to the left, there's 2 doors, and each door leads to more areas to explore. It's honestly awesome and really makes navigation interesting, but it is completely ruined by not having a map to track where you are. This game is full of this type of game design, where you're weaving in and out of doors, going from layer to layer, and in all kinds of directions. This game would be SO much better with a map. Seriously. \n\nAnother game I'll quickly mention that was less enjoyable due to navigation-issues was Banjo Tooie. Sure, it's an N64 game so you're expecting there to be a lack of QOL features, but this game is much more expensive than the first game and it has a lot more backtracking than the first game too. A map for each area would have made this game far less combersome and it would have made backtracking less confusing. Banjo-Kazooie didn't really need a map because the areas were all pretty compact and very well-designed. The areas in Banjo-Tooie are often interconnected, so a map is essential here. It would have made the game far more enjoyable for me. \n\nNow, there are tons of games that have a map system and progress tracker and I think this should be the standard to go by for most games. Unlike Phoenotopia' Awakening, Elliot Quest actually has a map system. It's a game that also goes for that Zelda II-style that I absolutely love (the exploration concept moreso than actual Zelda II). In this game, dungeons have a map that you can find and it will tell you where you haven't explored yet. Without the dungeon map, you can slowly fill the map out by exploring on your own. Hmm, this sounds familiar. \n\nOh ya, Zelda handles dungeon exploration the same way! And it does it this way because it works! In fact, it has worked since the NES days (I'm pretty sure NES Zelda had dungeon maps. If not, I know for a fact A Link to the Past had dungeon maps). These games were from 1985 - 1991 and someone they had a map system, when some games today don't. I don't remember anyone ever saying that A Link to the Past was ruined because of there being a map in each dungeon. That game is amazing and most Zelda games are amazing. Going back to them today is so much easier because of tracking what you've done in each dungeon, using the map. \n\nNow, my final example is Xenoblade Chronicles. This series has you explore the area maps on your own and essentially has you fill out the maps automatically. The more you explore, the more your map is uncovered. If you can't go someplace yet because the enemies are too strong or you don't have a certain ability, your map will be incomplete. By passing the game and looking at the map, you can easily tell where you haven't explored yet, so it is much easier to go back to those old areas once you're able to explore them. This makes the game really fun and it makes backtracking rewarding and exciting and also easy. The game also tracks all of your quests and story progress, which means you will never feel lost, even though these games are absolutely massive and overwhelming. \n\n\"But Matt\", I hear you say, \"I want to explore on my own. Maps make it feel more like a checklist and they take away the magic of exploration. I don't want hand-holding and I don't want the game to track all my progress. I can do that on my own\". That's great that you have that opinion. I don't agree at all, but good for you. Well, games should at least have the \\*option\\* of a map. If players want to play the entire game without a map, rather than not including one at all, it should be an option to just turn it off or on. Many games do this with mini-maps and it can easily be done with dungeon maps and world maps. The same goes for tracking your progress. Turning progress tracking on or off can make satisfy both types of gamers. Accessibility is important and you can easily target people who like the game tracking and people who like tracking on their own, just by including the option to turn the features on or off. \n\nI felt compelled to write about this because I feel like maps and progress tracking should be standard features in most games. I'm not going to complain about 2D Mario games not having a map because they're linear and that would just be silly. But I am definitely going to have an issue with non-linear games and games focused on exploration not including a map. I think developers should realize how important accessibility is and also realize that just because they don't need a map and they enjoy tracking progress on their own, doesn't mean that everyone else is like that. \n\nPhoenotopia and Blue Fire could easily be some of my favorite games, but it's a damn shame that they're a lot more stressful to navigate due to not having a map. Not including maps in most games is just lazy. No excuses about old-school design or anything. Zelda has had dungeon maps since its inception. If you want an old-school experience without maps, just make it a difficulty mode to select instead of making the experience worse for everyone else. With that being said, you won't find me coming back to Final Fantasy: the Four Heroes of Light anytime soon...",

This could possibly be biased because more and more games are being developed? But I don't have the quantifiable data to prove that games are feeling more underwhelming recently. Anyways, back to MVP.\n\nMinimal viable product is making a product that just meets criteria for deployment. A common practice for software development because it allows faster prototyping and consumer feedback. \n\nMost live-service games of course are inherently supporting of this idea, because the iterative development means consumers don't feel entirely ripped off if a product arrives in a beta state. The growing trend is you'll see it single purchase games too, as the format is too enticing for companies to ignore. Instead of asking 'what will make the consumer happy?' its turned into 'what is the minimum we can ship that won't cause an avalanche of bad reviews?' If they can produce a game with '30%' features, that could save 5 months of design time, and will be 70% metacritic or better, and won't completely anger the fans, why not do that? So then it also turns into, 'what features get us to 70% metacritic the fastest?'\n\nAs gaming workloads get larger and larger for developers, and the industry becomes more and more commercialized, these time saving measure will be employed to their max.\n\nDoomer take is that the AAA format is cursed for the foreseeable future. Of course some developers will be able to quarantine the creative employees from financial pressures, and maybe  as a result a AAA company with high demands can turn out something with built in passion, creativity, and good game-play. But the amount of single purchase games I see with underwhelming gameplay and features is growing.\n\n(Notable recent example; Pokemon Scarlet/Violet)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zb390m/i_love_what_ff7r_had_to_say_about_fandom/",
        "text": "(Spoilers for both the original and the remake, of course)\n\nTo say the FF7 remake was divisive would be underselling it quite a bit, I think. Even to this day, I feel like a lot of people are really unsure what to make of it. I don't see enough discussion around the meta-narrative, and what it says about gaming.\n\nFF7 grapples with the game's identity and reason for existing in a way I honestly did not expect it to. Fans clamoured for a remake of this game for years, while they were simultaneously ready to pounce on any imperfection, real or perceived, to a potential remake. SE had to grapple with characters who had been Flanderized and whose fandom personalities bear little resemblance to the characters in the original story (SE itself is also to blame for this, with how they handled the characters in the extended universe.) For example, in the fanon of FF7, Tifa and Aerith seem to resemble the Madonna/Whore paradox (Women being either pure motherly beings or promiscuous sexual creatures). The problem is that their personalities have been swapped in the collective minds of fans. If you play the original games, Tifa in spite of her more \"assertive\" character design was the demure, almost shy character, while Aerith was the loud boisterous woman who started flirting with Cloud the second they met to get what she needed out of him (protection from the Turks.). Aerith is the woman who plainly talks about her past boyfriends with her \"hired\" bodyguard, who she is paying by dating. I firmly believe that the reason their character's personalities have seen such a flip in the fandom is due to their character design, and Aerith's untimely death. \n\n\nThese characterizations are just one of many problems that SE had going into this remake.  Is Cloud the tortured loner who wants to push everyone away and take the weight of the world himself, or the cold mercenary who doesn't give a fuck? Not really, and the original game makes it clear. For lack of better words for him, OG Cloud was *goofy*. He was a character who unironically used the word mosey, whose bluff of a cold unfeeling character was obviously seen through by literally every character in the game (Look at those original Avalanche scenes.) and even he admits its a front to a degree. He is in the midst of a mental breakdown, but that darkness doesn't consume him. He's not the character that you would expect just from cultural osmosis. \n\nThe plot was the next big issue. People wanted expanded, but they also wanted the plot to be true to the original, which hamstrings the devs. Before the game first released, when we saw scenes of Jesse's expanded story, there was a lot of harrumphing of \"Why waste time on Jesse? we know she's gonna die early on.\" People wanted a full game out of Midgar, but they also know the important story beats of Midgar, so any changes would be seen as padding to the runtime. It was, in some ways, truly an impossible game to make, and I can understand why they had so many issues deciding on how to tackle it. \n\nIn come the ghosts.\n\nThese ghosts are, in my opinion, a wonderful distillation of the fandom. They show up any time the game threatens to go too out there or stray too far from the plot. \"No Cloud, you do need to help with the second reactor mission. It is what you do. It is how the story goes.\" This culminates with them literally bringing Barret back to life. \"No, Barret can't die now. That doesn't happen!\". They kind of channel the aspect of obssessed fandom personified by Annie Wilkes in Misery, where things must be done the right way, the way they should be.\n\nI can understand why this kind of meta-narrative wasn't necessarily popular with many members of the fandom, but I love it. I think FF7R works well as a behemoth company looking at a piece of media they do not have control over, that they cannot remake in a way that any large portion of their fandom would come to a consensus over, and instead of trying to thread that impossible needle, saying \"We are going to show you why we aren't going to do what you want in the future. You want the full Midgar game? Fine, we will give it to you, but you're going to need to reexamine why and what you expected it to be.\"\n \nWhen it comes to media, I don't particularly care about adherence to \"Canon\". I find that it at best leads to creatives having to execute someone else's vision rather than their own at best, and a study in mediocrity at worst (See the first 2 Harry Potter movies for the dangers of a near line by line remake). The original book/movie/game is always going to be there, I want to see what a creative mind can do with the world and setting I love. I think this is why  **The Shining** or **Jurassic Park** or **Who Framed Roger Rabbit** work so well. They don't force themselves to keep to the original story for the sake of \"it's canon\". \n\n\nWhen the remake was first announced, I told all of my friends that what I wanted more than anything was for Cloud to save Aerith from Sephiroth, and die in her place. Take one of the most iconic moments of gaming, and change it up, shake the game from the safety net of the original game and tell a new and interesting story. While they might not have done that (Yet!) , I do think the changes made make for a much more interesting story coming rather than the same story I can play whenever I want. SE has, through their meta-narrative, freed themselves from the shackles of their fandom and expectations, and I'm super excited to see what comes next.",

First off, its obvious that by then there will be a very powerful machine learning upscaling option available to the consoles. Look at what FSR can do already. In 6 years, FSR and DLSS and possibly DirectML will be pretty much equal and way more useful then the current DLSS 3. \n\nIf games were made right now specifically for the RTX4090, all of them would have ray traced global illumination at 120fps. So its really obvious that the far superior PS6 and XSX2 GPU will also be capable of this. \n\nTLDR\n\nPS6 and XSX2 will be the golden age of video game graphics and performance. With advanced upscaling of the future, I can easily imagine 480p getting upscaled to superior to native 4k. And at a very low frame time cost. And with hardware accelerated ray tracing of the future, developers will include ray traced global illumination in every game. Every game will be like Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition. \n\nI think PS6 and XSX2 will have game options to run at 480p, 120fps, with raytraced global illumination. And upscaled to 4k.\n\nFor all the haters and non believers, remember that Metro Exodus runs at 60fps with ray traced global illumination on **XBOX SERIES S**!",

        "text": "As a kid, my parents rarely bought me games. That meant that on the rare occasion when I got a new one, I would put it on the hardest difficulty so that it would take me longer to beat it. It worked great - I would play the same levels over and over until I had perfected a routine that could beat it. And I enjoyed myself.\n\nThe problem is that now I have the view that I'm cheating if I'm playing on anything but the hardest difficulty. And as an adult with all the adult things that sponge up my spare time, I don't have time to keep at a level. I'm in the position that I can't enjoy a game with the knowledge that I'm playing on an easier difficulty and I don't enjoy myself with the few moments I have to play games because I can't make progress. \n\nI'm just curious if there's anyone else who kinda wishes difficulty levels weren't a thing.",

Now in Mass Effect 2 he's actually aiming and using cover and can very occasionally pull off a headshot when using a sniper rifle. \n\nThe next step I want to teach him is how to predict enemy movements. E.g if an enemy running, you're not going to aim for them. You can see the direction they're running in so you're going to aim at where they're going to be and let them walk into the recticle. If you only have 2 bullets left in your magazine, you're going to reload so you're not caught reloading under fire and left vulnerable. He doesn't get these things though. The way I tried to explain it to him is \"You want to be thinking about what you're going to be doing ten seconds from now. \" but I don't know how to explain it to him.",

Is this true?\n\n\nAll the games I’ve listed above left a mark on me,that’s why I don’t regret every cent I spent on them and every single hour I put into them. The gameplay itself was at times somewhat tedious or repetitive(ahem ahem definiteky not talking about RDR2 and TW3)  or frustrating but ultimately very rewarding ( Elden ring and Bloodborne) but the stories and the worlds and just the complete experience of those games is the selling point for me. \n\n\nHow do switch exclusives like BoTW, Super Mario Odyssey,Bayonetta series,Xenoblade series,Animal Crossing , Mario Kart and Super smash bros compare? \nIf they are simply interesting toys ,then I don’t think it justifies buying a different console just for them.

        "text": "After reading someones comment in another thread and seeing such a big similarity to my introduction to gaming, it made me want to hear other peoples stories!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me, it was sometime between 1991-1992 when I was 2/3 years old. I was a big fan of aviation already, and absolutley loved airplanes. My parents had some IBM clone they built in the late 80's that ran on MS DOS and my Dad had Microsoft flight simulator. I would sit on his lap and watch him fly with the joystick. In hindsight it must have been only a few frames per second, but it was mind-blowing for me. My parents also had an NES, and were HUGE fans of The Legend of Zelda &amp; Zelda II The Adventures of Link. I would watch them play both for hours. Since I had been talking since I was a year old, and could speak to my parents in full sentences by 18-24 months (and ask them a million questions), I asked them If I could play these games. So my parents started me up, taught me how to use the controllers, and let me have at it with Super Mario 3 &amp; Zelda II, The Adventures of Link. Since I was talking so early, and asking so many questions about airplanes (how fast can an F-14 go?, How much does it cost to buy one? Can I have an F-14?) they decided to stick me in pre-school at 2 years old, as they thought I was ready. This greatly improved my reading skills, and that made me fall in love with Zelda II even more. I did everything I could to get to as many villages as I could so I could walk around the side scrolling areas and talk to all the different people. Then around the time my sister was born, they got an SNES, and my 3/4 year old mind was BLOWN AWAY. I was hooked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIll never forget the day my mom brought home A Link To The Past. At this time, I could read fairly well, and it was the first game I truly set out on my own to beat (outside of the Mario games). I sunk hours and hours into that game, exploring Hyrule, talking to all the different people, searching for rupees and items. I played it regularly up until OOT came out. I was completely hooked. To me, there was nothing cooler than airplanes and video games (still feel that way tbh). My mom got me U.N. Squadron one year for my birthday. I couldn't wait to go to blockbuster and rent a new game. Every time we would go, the second we went in the store and my sister and mom would go to the movies, and I would go straight to the video game section. Searching the wall of games, admiring the box art, reading the backs of them to learn as much as I could about all the games they had to offer. Then finally when I picked out the one I wanted to rent, reading the booklet on the drive home to learn everything I could about the game before I went home and booted it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen in 1995, the game completely changed for me. My sister and I were at a family friends 7th birthday party, when the girls mom came over to me and said \" Your mom just called, she's coming to pick you guys up, she has a surprise\". 20 minutes later, I see my moms minivan pull up, my dad opens the side door, and theres a huge box in the seat. It was a Power Macintosh 7500 with a 1gb hard drive. My parents explained to me how much space that was at the time, and how much more memory it had than our old IBM clone. In the back seat was another box, a joystick. We get home, my parents set the computer up, and I remember the OS blowing me away completely. The colors, the sound, the interface. And then my dad whipped out a CD. It was F/A-18 Hornet 2.0. A fully 3D flight simulator. It was my first time seeing truly 3D graphics in a video game, as N64 was still a ways a way. I played that demo for hours and hours. Aviation + Video games was just heaven for me (still is). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen N64 Came out. I got Shadows of The Empire and Mario 64 and played them endlessly. I was completely hooked. Then the information starting coming out about OOT. My mom, being very handy with the internet even in its infancy, would follow any and all news about OOT very closely and share it with me. My dad would bring home magazines that had articles about it. Everything. We all were so excited for a 3D Zelda on this new generation console. My mom waited to pick up OOT at midnight at a store by us, and my dad let me stay up to wait for her, but I fell asleep. Ill never forget booting it up the next morning and seeing my moms file with extra hearts and the green spiritual stone. Turning that game on for the first time, it was pure magic. I was already hooked for life. But OOT really changed the game for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I am many many years later, still very much loving video games, but many years behind technology wise. I have a switch, a Quest 2, my OG Fat PS3, and a 10 year old MacBook Air that I have some emulators on. My wife is a gamer as well, OOT was actually the first thing we ever talked about. My step daughter (12) is also a big gamer herself, and my 3 yr old son loves to sit on my lap and watch me play BOTW, so he'll likely be one too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your stories?",

        "text": "It's really disheartening looking at the current landscape of big titles.\n\n It's always a mix of overhype and hyperbole with extreme cynicism. Review Scores are treated as gospel, and things under 90 are treated like failures, even by some publishers. Trailers come out and there is immediately comments on frame rate and resolution. Demands of a certain amount of hours but that it cant feel padded. For being fans of the medium, the impossible standards and cynicism is quite strange as people watch every new reveal with arms crossed unimpressed.\n\nStudios are now taking much longer to develop a single game and have to focus on frame rate and visuals above all else, thinking about metacritic. Unlike early generations, one game that underperforms can end a company.  Often these standards mean a game is released with issues in these departments and are attacked for failing at what the audience set up.\n\nI think we advanced in tech too quickly and are constantly trying to play catch-up. Companies could release more games with polish and care, free to experiment without losing their jobs, and not take 4 years to do it. I think we are still in early PS4 days but the world is demanding late PS5 or higher.\n\nThe indie boom has been releasing my favourite titles for many years now. I think bigger studios should be bold enough to release titles that are less straining and life consuming. My PS1, 2 and Steam library still get the most time.\n\nSome collective jump backwards in our standards is obviously not possible, but you can slowly dial expectations. AAA should be free to make these so called \"lesser titles\".",

        "text": "Since the dawn of gaming on YouTube, one of the most popular forms of let’s play is the horror game. Nothing is funnier than watching your favorite YouTube or streamer scream like a lunatic for hours on end. \n\nWhile this makes for great content on those sites, I’ve always wondered how this impacts the success of these games. Obviously success can be measured in several different ways. Having millions of eyes on your game is certain one form of success. But does it translate into any financial success?\n\nOnce you’ve watched a streamer play through the game, solve all the puzzles, and find all the scary bits, is there much of a reason for you to then purchase the game? \n\nI ask this because I’m also guilty of this. I watch AlphaBetaGamer and MainlyBadAssHero. The games they feature are awesome and very well made. But I’ve never gone on to buy any of the games I’ve watched them play. \n\nFor many indie horror games, they’re offered for free on Itch.io or other collections. They’re not expecting any financial return. But there’s a definitely subset of AA games (or B-games) that I feel really struggle to find success. \n\nDue to this, we’ve seen a large rise in multiplayer horror games. Dead By Daylight is extremely popular on Twitch and Phasmaphobia was a runaway success. \n\nIs there no longer a place for anything in between? Are indie horror devs forever cursed to offer their stuff for free so they can get as many eyeballs on it as possible? Is it only the few remaining big single player horror franchises that have a change at real, sustainable success? (Examples: Resident Evil, Outlast, Amnesia, Supermassive Games, Callisto Protocol and Dead Space)\n\nAnd if that’s the case, what is the solution? Streaming and YouTube has always benefitted larger companies as free advertising. But when it comes to indie stuff, especially a genre that’s hard to enjoy the same way the second time through, does it cause more harm than good?",

        "text": "So I will be using ten key aspects in this comparison with some extra categories at the end just for fun. \n\nI hope you guys enjoy this and let's have a nice discussion about it. \n\nI will also be keeping score after every comparison. \n\nER 0 : GOWR 0\n\n1. Controls - \n\nThis is a pretty close call but something must be superior. Both games handle extreme well and are pretty tight registering wise. However I must give it to Elden Ring mainly because of the cinematic padding from Ragnarok that totally restricts the player from the core gameplay for long periods of time. \n\nER 1 : GOWR 0\n\n2. Aesthetics -\n\nOnce again another very close call. Both games are absolutely beautiful but Elden Ring has one thing over Ragnarok and that's organic style where the world feel more natural and deep. Ragnarok gets too Fisherprice for me at times which took me out of immersion several times unfortunately. \n\nER 2 : GOWR 0\n\n3. Sound - \n\nThese first few key aspects are difficult for me personally especially this one. You know what? Ragnarok gets this one because I had a lot of complaints about how the music was handled in Elden Ring so Ragnarok gets it's first point for being super memorable in the sound department. \n\nER 2 : GOWR 1\n\n4. World - \n\nNot to get this confused with Aesthetics or Level Design but this is mainly about generalization of atmosphere and circumstance. This one also goes to Ragnarok due to the incredible presentation of the story which Elden Ring is very loose and subjective about which I do love however I did enjoy the overall experience of Ragnarok's realm despite it's many flaws in other departments. \n\nER 2 : GOWR 2\n\n5. Gameplay - \n\nI'm going to be blunt and hand this to Elden Ring easily. The gameplay in Ragnarok is great but falls flat for me personally especially with the amount of potential it has combat wise. I found myself extremely bored of the tediously bloated encounters in Ragnarok which little to no encouragement to keep playing after the credits. \n\nER 3 : GOWR 2\n\n6. Level Design - \n\nRagnarok had a great start at the beginning of the game but it eventually turned into a mundane and formulaic layout with some areas being complex but overall was terribly designed in my opinion. Elden Ring has it's weak moments in this category but totally nails it most of the time. \n\nER 4 : GOWR 2\n\n7. Characters - \n\nI loved the characters in Ragnarok so much. The design and personalities were incredibly addicting for the most part. Elden Ring mostly sticks with the same standing, leaning or crouching NPCs that don't really stand out as well like they did in previous From Software games. Ragnarok gets a point. \n\nER 4 : GOWR 3\n\n8. Challenge &amp; Reward - \n\nOkay, first of all the difficulty has always been spongy in God of War and I absolutely can not stand difficulty options. With that said Ragnarok is probably the easiest God of War game main campaign wise. The side quests from what I've heard have crazy bosses but I do not know much on why. However the obvious choice is Elden Ring because From Software has perfected this recipe in general just due to the impact on the topic alone has had in gaming. I felt immense satisfaction all the way through Elden Ring but not once in Ragnarok did I get a sense of accomplishment even remotely close. \n\nER 5 : GOWR 3\n\n9. Story - \n\nI really though Ragnarok would dominate this category. I was really hoping for a heart throbbed thrill though the story was a complete wreck with safe plot directions and a lot of anticlimactic build ups. The story in Elden Ring is a bit opaque but effective. Personally I have never cared much about the LORE in the From Software games but Ragnarok disappointed me so much that I can't reward that kind story structure. \n\nER 6 : GOWR 3\n\n10. Lasting Appeal - \n\nThis includes replay value and uniqueness of the game. Elden Ring simply wins in a land slide just due to the unlimited builds possible and encouraging challenge to keep improving on. Ragnarok with it's cinematic padding and hand holding doesn't encourage me to play every again unfortunately. Each encounter basically has the same combat solution which is very boring to me and simply adjusting the difficulty higher just makes it more so tedious. \n\nER 7 : GOWR 3\n\nI really thought Ragnarok would catch up but my preferences really came through on what I prefer in gaming. \n\nI'll throw in subcategories just for fun.\n\nDuo Boss Fights: Ragnarok \n\nDialog: Elden Ring \n\nBosses: Elden Ring \n\nWorld Traversal: Elden Ring \n\nCover Art: Ragnarok \n\nSecrets: Elden Ring \n\nMetroidvania Aspects: Ragnarok \n\nCutscene: Ragnarok \n\nHave fun everyone.",

I'm wondering what everyone here thinks about this.\n\n I hate when games have a fun gameplay loop with well oiled mechanics but constantly try to have you do everything but engage with them.\n\nThe worst recent example I have to offer is Bayonetta 3. The game has a fantastic and fun combat system which is the main reason most people would play it. However, it feels like the game constantly wants you to do everything else but engage with the combat system.\n\nLevels features a bunch of segments where you ride a monster through a section, using different controls and mechanics than the normal game. They also feature a lot of gimmick bosses where the usual combat mechanics are dumped in exchange of something like a rails shooter minigame for example. Most levels also include jumping puzzles, which are just not fun.\n\nTo me, the whole game felt more like a minigame compilation than a spectacle fighter.\n\nWhy do game designers do this ? It can't be for monetary or time crunching reasons. Designing, coding and making these ''minigames'' creates additional workload rather than just padding out the game with more ''standard'' content like re-using enemies or putting additional combat encounters in levels.",

        "text": "\nSomething I’ve been researching since getting into horror games is the effectiveness of realism on the genre. As tech gets better, expectations rise. \n\nBut does that limit the expression of horror games? With better graphics comes the expectation of better animations, facial capture, etc. Everything is so exactly crafted that it leaves little room for interpretation and abstraction. \n\nFor quite some time there’s been a rise in low poly PS1 style horror games. Many are simple games but there are some gems in there. But I wonder if the return to lower graphics allows for our mind to fill in the blanks better than AAA style graphics. Therein creating a “scarier” experience. \n\nThis isn’t an argument for or against either style. I’m just wondering where people are at. As an example of good AAA horror (graphically speaking) I would point to PT and Resident Evil 7 (and 8’s dollhouse level). \n\nOn the other end, I feel like most of the stuff that comes out of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn)  looks like everyone is made of wax. Callisto Protocol looks silly more than scary because the gore and blood is so shiny and sticky it reminds me of 80’s slasher movies. \n\nBonus question related to the thesis above: do you think that AAA style graphics and realism are necessary to deal with mature topics in games? \n\nAppreciate any response. Hopefully I explained myself clearly.",

        "text": "**This is a rather wandering (I won't flatter myself by saying \"experimental\") post. I'm not really married to my points and I don't know if I even have a specific thesis so I'm sure you all will challenge me on anything that seems weird or underdeveloped or off!**\n\nI really hate the term \"IP\" as it's often used in the video game and mainstream film communities, to refer to a series of texts that share a set of copyrightable world elements, characters, aesthetic features, title, etc. To me the phrase foregrounds and reifies the notion that an art work or creative act is the \"property\" of an individual (or, much more frequently, a multinational corporation).\n\nOK. But I don't expect everyone to be some flavor of leftist, and in favor of the permanent abolition of private intellectual (not to mention real) property. So I'd like to explore a different issue with the notion of \"IP\" through what seems to have been everyone's favorite game of the 2010s, *Breath of the Wild*.\n\nI got a Switch a few months ago and my first game was, per necessity, *BotW*. I've spent at least 40 hours trying very hard to like or even appreciate it, based on the astounding uniformity of critical, media, and community praise, as well as opinions and explanations from friends whom I respect for their aesthetic taste, critical perspective and game design knowledge.\n\nIt's just not for me. There was good in there, and I also know anything I disliked about the game -- the empty and aimless game world, the questionable item and combat mechanics, the monotony of the shrines, the fact that it's not really a *Zelda* game *per se* \\-- has already been litigated ad nauseam over the last five years while I've been living under a rock.\n\nInstead, I want to focus on the last item in my list of hit-and-run critiques, \"it's not really a *Zelda* game *per se*\". A related bit of snark running through my head while playing was \"I've already played *Skyrim*\". Don't worry, I know *BotW* isn't *Skyrim*. But also, it's a lot like *Skyrim*, isn't it? It's also a game with quest hubs, scaling enemies, a strictly optional storyline, a wealth of equipment and consumable tools, and an emphasis on wandering around and finding people, things, and experiences. I'm not being obtuse, here: I know what an open-world game is. I'm not a grognard, either: there's no reason *Zelda* can't be an open-world game.\n\nMaybe the question is this: \"how does an open-world *Zelda* game differ from an open-world non-*Zelda* game?\" What is the nature of players' investment in the \"IP\" of the *Zelda* games that allows this solidly-built but somewhat unremarkable game to ascend the heights of critical and community praise?\n\nIs it nostalgia? I've been playing Nintendo games since the 90s and in a very real way decided to buy not only *BotW* but the Switch itself on the strength of those memories. But even as I say this, I'm acutely aware that I'm thinking of *Zelda* not as artwork (i.e., something sui generis) but rather as product, produced to certain specifications and under constraints of e.g. copyright law, marketability, brand consistency...\n\nMaybe the question is this: why didn't Nintendo make a game like *BotW*, but not a *Zelda* game? what is the nature of copyright holders' investment in the \"IP\" of *Zelda*, Marvel, Mario, *Final Fantasy*?\n\nWe could speculate, a bit conspiratorially, that it's a method to renew copyright in perpetuity through the release of new media (the Mickey Mouse argument goes along similar lines, I believe). I really hate the term \"IP\" but I understand why it needs to be used in our community. Yet I don't really see anyone questioning the premise.\n\nMaybe the question is this: Is the character of Link, who never speaks a word, never deviates from the prehistoric ideal of \"selfless hero\", never really evolves new gamic capabilities or narrative capacities, really so compelling that we must see him appear in game after game, daily almost, until the end of time? If so, why? Why do we want 30 iterations of the Zelda story but nobody is clamoring for *Hamlet 2* or *Iliad: The After Years*?",

        "text": "Outer Wilds is one of the most raved about games of our time. It’s sparked countless r/truegaming discussions about its beauty and narrative and exploration, and is probably a strong contender for one of the best received games of the last generation. Certainly, it’s to be remembered as a once-in-a-lifetime experience that the industry will never see the likes of ever again.\n\n…why?\n\nOuter Wilds started off cool enough for me. It had just dropped on PS Now, and considering in the relative sea of trash they would put on there Outer Wilds seemed to be Jesus’ foreskin, pure and untainted in a pile of Lucifer’s shit. Exploring the camp around me, roasting marshmallows and chilling by a fire. interacting with all the people and the world around me. Fun stuff. I get my launch codes and prepare to brave the solar system around me. But when I do get to this solar system, I find it to be less than enjoyable. The manoeuvring felt clunky and difficult to me, and it was hard to properly align your ship when landing. I had no real motivation to explore around me. I got lost in layers of ocean on Giant’s Deep and fell into crevices and died on Ember Twin. As a result, I bounced off the game hard until a little later on when I tried it again, to the same effect. Often, the first time I try a game I might kind of hate it; I didn’t like Bloodborne and thought Soulsborne games were just bad until I tried Demon’s Souls and now I’m an avid Souls fan. I thought KOTOR was a dated hunk of junk with awful combat, but now I love it for its deep roleplaying and great story. I used to think AC Valhalla was derivative and bland. I still think this, but it is pretty fun despite that. Outer Wilds is just one of those games that I won’t stick onto, like Hollow Knight or Kingdom Come.\n\nWhat is it about this game that enraptures you all so deeply? Do I need to just give it a fair shake and fall in love with it? Am I just a simple minded oaf who thinks Andrew Ryan was the good guy? I don’tknow. Maybe I am. But what made you believe Outer Wilds was such a special experience?",

        "text": "I shared the way that I deal with my backlog on r/patientgamers, and people seemed to like it. So I'll share it here as well, in case it's useful to anyone.\n\n*TL;DR:  If you're (1) a bit of a completionist, and (2) stressed out by an ever-growing backlog, then maybe try a \"Games in Progress\" limit.*\n\nI like to complete my games. Maybe [I'm playing them wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/xfsfgu/youre_playing_games_wrong/),  but it's the way my brain works: I like to see those credits roll, or else I don't feel closure. That means that sometimes I  find myself playing a game just to beat it, when I'd rather be enjoying something else. Pleasure turns to chore.\n\nAlso, I don't like backlogs. Ticking games off a list feels like work.\n\nInstead,  what works for me is a GIP Limit. It's like the \"Work in Progress  Limit\" that I use on the job, only for games. I have a folder that  contains the games I'm playing, and I cap them at 6 max. (That number  works for me. YMMV.)\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* No  cheating. If the GIP is full, I don't add a new game until I free up a  slot (usually by beating a game in the GIP). No big deal: I always have a  game or two that are close to completion.\n* I  strive for a diverse GIP. Right now it's Doom 2016, Obra Dinn, Monster Hunter Rise, a racing game and a masocore platformer, plus a free slot in case I fancy something new. If I'm in a  gaming mood, one of those will fit the moment, guaranteed.\n* If  a game stays in the GIP for years, that's OK. Maybe it will have its  moment in a month. No pressure to finish it, just kick back and enjoy it  when I feel like it. I only play Doom once every couple of months, and I'm fine with that. I'll finish it eventually.\n\nIt's a small thing–but if you're slightly obsessive like I am, it might work for you as well.",

        "text": "I mean, video games are the perfect medium for this type of narrative structure and i feel it has not been exploited enough. I just feel sad that movie-like games ended up prevailing, making games feel as just interactive films, when the branching storytelling or even the game taking totally different routes depending on your action seems an alternative that can work very well in games. And i don't mean just different lines of dialogue or endings but literally the game taking different vibes and narratives depending on your decisions.\n\nIt is certainly more ambitious and difficult but it is a path that needs to be explored more. Some memorable examples to see what i mean is something like the game Star Fox 64, or The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, which had a three day cycle and on each cycle you lived different lives and adventures.\n\nThis is something where the medium of visual novels is leaps and bounds ahead, although these are closer to books than games since most of the time you just click and select lines of text. They are not very popular in the west since they are often known as cringy dating simulators for weebs. But don't sleep of them, there are truly some gems of storytelling hidden in there. I was blown away with the narrative of a game called Muv Luv, one of the most ambitious pieces of storytelling i have ever read; there is also the more well known example of Doki Doki Literature Club which pretty much became viral, although mostly because of its meta scary format.\n\nIn any case i would like to see gameplay based games out there that take this format seriously. I have heard that the Mass Effect series is this way. I haven't played them, but does really the story and the game itself change that much depending on what you do?\n\nI feel there is so much untapped potential there and not even the Star Fox series or the Zelda series continued to play with the format in subsequent games. A very ambitious masterpiece can be made this way if you put the same care on every branch, in both gameplay and structure. Games have the potential to branch out (literally) from Hollywood and book type narratives this way.",

        "text": "I have been playing FFXIV and near the end of ARR, I get a prompt saying that there would be some cutscenes now so you should set aside some time for them.  \n\nTurns out that those cutscenes are the normal press to proceed dialogue rather than free flowing conversations. I personally feel that they make conversations to be completely mechanical no matter the performance of the voice actors. Auto text doesn't help either as there are often long pauses after the dialogue.  \n\nAnother weird thing I found out in such games is that characters will sometimes give out paragraphs of exposition while the other characters stand still. This makes the characters feel like lifeless dolls without personalities when it's not their turn to talk.  \n\nThis is not a criticism of FFXIV. This thing has been bugging me since I watched a trailer of One Piece Odyssey recently. I love the interactions of the characters in the anime and feel that the voice actors are excellent. However, in the game, the dialogue just doesn't seem fun (from what is shown). The dialogue itself isn't bad, but its delivery ruins a few jokes and makes the conversation feel lifeless.",

        "author": "AnokataX",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/z80lct/estimating_the_time_loss_of_slower_loads_in_games/",
        "text": "I was curious how much time was actually lost to waiting on load screens over the course of a full game, so I was thinking of how to do a comparison over a full game, not just comparing a few load screens. Eventually, I decided for a general estimate, speedruns can give a very reasonable enough ballmark.\n\nAs an example, [Octopath Traveler](https://www.speedrun.com/octopath?h=Galdera-Switch-NMG&amp;x=rklqp382-38djg5z8.9qjx650l-rn1z9w1l.klrvewjq)'s speedrun for its final boss is around 3h50m on Switch. On PC, an approximately equivalent time is 3h30m with the same general route (I'm using times from an older route, but I know these numbers are accurate since I speedrun the game too).\n\nThat means across 4h, PC's faster loads save about 20m (actually more since it saves 20m in 3h50m but I'm trying to be generous to Switch). That's 5m lost every hour, and across a 100h game, it's 500m lost or 8h20m lost in just loading time for playing a game on Switch.\n\nObviously, not all games have such differences in loads, like indie games with virtually no load differences. But for this discussion, I want to focus on games that do have such significant loads, as there definitely are a few like this that are available on both Switch and PC and load very differently.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n- How significant is this to people who have to decide between consoles for such a thing?\n\n- For example, is losing 8h of time in waiting across 100h significantly a big detractor, or is it fine since its spread out and spaced inbetween the \"fun\" moments of the game?\n\n- Is there an issue with looking at games and time in this way?\n\n(This topic stemmed from me trying to find ways to squeeze more time out to play, and I wanted opinions as I'm uncertain dropping $430+ on a Steam Deck for mainly better loads for a small handful of 3 or so games is worth it for me.)",

Freemium is often is associated with 'dark design', where the designer tries to influence the player to choose options that benefit the publishers of the game — for example, making additional in-game purchases or playing the game more regularly.\n\nThis kind of thing is well-explored in mobile games, but not so much in PC games.

You'd need to complete an online anonymous survey that involves watching short video clips and answering some questions.

Each time I play a new one, I feel satisfied to have expanded my knowledge of the medium a little bit more. Simply put, I love games so much that I want to play ALL of them, or at least as many as I can. This is obviously impossible, and I know I should just accept that fact, but the thought of missing out on so many cool experiences has me futilely digging into an endlessly deep catalogue of games. It doesn't matter how close I think I am to finishing my backlog, I always find another hidden gem that I hadn't given attention to before. I still enjoy playing games in the moment, but the enormity of the task is causing me more anxiety than it should. My passion for this medium is ironically causing me to become burnt out by it. To be honest, I encounter this problem in other aspects of life as well, such as what skills to learn, what countries to travel to, and what people to spend time with. Life just has so much cool stuff in it - how can you decide what to spend time on? Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how are you dealing with it? Thanks for your help!",

There's also cases like Gravity Rush, where the language spoken is a gibberish form of real world languages, iirc a mix of French and Japanese in this case.\n\nOr there's even some others like Undertale or Okami, where the sounds aren't made to represent voices at all but just to add another layer to the characters, and aren't just fluff typing sounds liek some old rpgs.\n\nBut there did this trend originate exactly, and when did it become popular?

I mean, you may disagree with this choice, but isn't it fair to give them a chance to see if this hate is that strong?\n\nIt would've also wrong to not to mention Need For Speed: Unbound and The Callisto Protocol which are up to be released this year as well. \n\n**This \"Player's choice\" is a spit to the face of true gamers who don't run for popular games, but seem to find hidden gems even in not the very best examples.** The most of the games I listed are not even bad.

        "text": "If you haven't been following the Halo news, [Halo Infinite is expected to get a Battle Royale soon](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/halo-infinite-battle-royale-tatanka). Though I think the Season 4 target is unrealistic, it is expected to be soon and possibly by the end of next year.\n\nThe reason I post this is because I tried out my first Battle Royale, Apex Legends, about a month ago and like it a lot. Maybe I don't have enough experience with Battle Royales to make this comment, but I see Infinite's weapon/equipment design philosophy around being an arena shooter being a sticking point in making it work well.\n\nFor example, take the Stalker Rifle. If you are a good player, this weapon is fundamentally superior to the Battle Rifle and Commando. You should do your damnedest to pick up this weapon and rip some kills with it. In Halo this is perfectly fine; the Stalker Rifle is classified as a Tier 2 weapon and is placed in contestable territory to encourage engagements and reward skilled players. In Apex, a weapon being fundamentally superior to another is grounds for a balance change. At least in theory, Weapons can be better in certain contexts (sniper vs assault rifle), but weapons that are just fundamentally superior are no-nos. They create an imbalance if someone gets these by luck instead of through successive battles.\n\nSo one obvious solution here is to make the Stalker Rifle a \"high-tier loot,\" ie, to place it in an area where superior items are expected and are therefore usually contested. But that begets a second issue that's bigger than the Stalker Rifle: Halo Infinite currently does not have weapon roster to satisfy the the unpredictable gameplay element of the battle royale. Apex can get around this issue by incorporating attachments and other equipment into the looting loop, so *all* weapons can count as high-tier loot. Infinite currently doesn't have this, and has effectively 4 Tier-II weapons to contest: the Stalker Rifle, the Shock Rifle, the Heatwave, and the Bulldog. That's not much. I wonder how they are going to get around this issue.",

        "text": "This thought struck me today. Gaming is a lot larger than it used to be back in the 90's when I got into it. Gaming used to be the kids in their basement glued to a monitor instead of out in the world getting into normal kid things. We were a product of a different sort of culture than people getting into the hobby today. \n\nI remember when facebook games gave rise to the stay at home mom gamers. From Call of Duty and Halo rose the dude-bro gamers. People now form cliques not just around genre's, not just a single game, but just ways in which to play that game.\n\nNow games are something that is as normal as watching TV and we don't necessarily categorize ourselves as Televisioners or... stream watchers I guess nowadays. We've reached a threshold where telling me you play games is like telling me you eat breakfast. It would be more remarkable if you didn't play *something*. \n\nNow that the hobby is as large as it is, with so many different ways to play, genres to pick from, time invenstments, involvement, can we confidently say that \"gamer\" as a collective noun even exists anymore as a useful concept?",

        "text": "Not trying to make another GoW topic but this is the most recent and relevant game when it comes to what I'm talking about. A lot of people have been complaining about how in GoW Ragnorok the characters spoil the puzzles for you, but the funny thing for me as someone who only played GoW 2018 is that the puzzles in that game I felt were hardly puzzles most of the time. They were usually so easy and straightforward most of the time it felt there was no figuring out how to solve them it was just do this thing that just kinda wastes your time, thus to me hearing about characters spoiling puzzles in Ragnorok comes off as admittance that the puzzles arent very good since what's the point of a puzzle if you're not expected to use your brain to solve them? That's not to say simple and easy puzzles cant be satisfying but at least to me the puzzles in GoW came across as filler. And tbc it's not just GoW games like Uncharted or even hell Devil May Cry have this issue. \n\nOfcourse I have seen defenses of this with the claim that these puzzles are there for pacing reasons. They're there to break up the action and give you some down time because a game that is just constant pure action will get old quickly. First off I personally disagree as I've played plenty of games that were pure action without downtime that held my interest. Second I gotta ask is there not maybe a better way to have down time than force you through pathetically easy puzzles that feel more like busy work than anything? I've seen people defend the puzzle spoiling in Ragnorok by saying the game is for adults and adults dont have time to spend taking long amounts of time figuring out puzzles but by that logic your wasting the players time by having them there in the first place. Like if you really need downtime for the sake of pacing or a break from the action I gotta wonder is there not a better way to do it than puzzles? Especially when these games are made by huge studios with lots of money I gotta wonder could resources not be put into figuring something less tedius? \n\nI know its subjective as to how annoying these puzzles and they arent really the main focus are but especially considering a lot of these are high budget critically acclaimed games often touted as being among the best ever I dont think it's unfair to criticize them for sections that feel kinda lazy and not very fun or interesting, especially if you ever decide to replay these games, I can only imagine they force to make the games drag on rather than feel tight.",
