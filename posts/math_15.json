        "text": "Hi guys, im kind of new here and very bad at math so here goes my question.\n\nI have about 1000$ that i want to bet using the martingale technique, now different from roulette, which is 50/50 i plan on placing bets on soccer on 1 single club for a tie every week. If you don't know a lot about soccer a tie can give you a 3x profit of the amount you place the bet (ex: you place a bet 5$ on a tie and if you win you get 15$).\n\n\nSo, analyzing the club which i want to bet on for the whole season it's clear to me that they can't go without a tie for more than 7 games, that means if i play 2,4,8,16,32,64, and then by 128 i win that means (2+4+8+16+32+64=126$ which i lost and then 128 i win that means (128×3=384-126(which i lost)=that's 258 dollars profit!\n\n\nThen i plan on starting for 2 dollars again and repeat for the whole season. Now my question is, what did i miss?\n\nPs: sorry if my English it's not very good",

I don’t drink/party anymore, I’ve matured a lot.\n\nMy plan would be to take the classes slower. I struggled when I had multiple upper level math classes at one time because I never felt like I could fully focus on one. I was always juggling between two or three with due dates and testing. If I could take one at a time, that’d be perfect.\n\nI have a friend with a masters in math and he said if you can get a bachelors then you can get the masters. What do you y’all think? THANKS A BUNCH!!",

It disagrees with that complex analytic function for |x|&gt;1\n\n(1) and (3), if we're not careful, seem to contradict each other-- a complex-analytic function can be analytically continued, so it can't lose all its complex-analytic properties all of the sudden.  (2) and (4) seem to contradict for similar reasons-- if two complex-analytic functions agree on a region, then they must agree everywhere.  \n\n\nHere is the function and its graph \n\n[Desmos link here: https:\\/\\/www.desmos.com\\/calculator ](https://preview.redd.it/dovg9hyiloja1.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ce505964587f61443f7f202cd10a023caec6daa1)\n\nThe top function (graphed in red), has the properties I stated above. How can it possibly have those properties? Its because-- despite being complex-analytic, it cannot be *analytically* continued beyond |x|&lt;1. Therefore, all the usual properties of complex functions you know don't apply. It agrees precisely with the blue function for |x|&lt;1 by replacing 1/(1+x\\^k/2) with its Taylor series, but for |x|&gt;1 this expansion is illegal since it doesn't converge-- hence why the functions no longer agree.   \nAlso, the title is subjective, but I find it surprising that a function can move from being so well-behaved to so badly behaved in a kind of continuous manner as this function does.",

Everyday I keep telling myself my life would've been so much better if I had majored in Computer Science at a lower ranked university rather than taking the bait for a joint major called \"Mathematics-Computer Science\" that's really mostly math. Honestly, all I want to do is work from home and not be stressed. I thought the major looking like a double major (even though it's really just one major) would catch some eyes, but now I'm having second thoughts.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of what I'd imagined I'd be doing, I'm killing myself by bending over to do math problems all the time. At the same time, I notice how much easier my cs courses are and it just makes me feel so regretful for picking status over passion. I feel like this math is hindering my dream of working from home in a low stress environment, since I feel like I have less time for internships and job prep due to all of these fucking math classes that I'm taking and that I'm probably going to forget once I graduate. \n\nI just keep thinking back to myself why I made the choice in the first place, and I think it alongside the double major idea it was literally just because I wanted to be at a \"prestigious\" school, whatever the fuck that means. When I apply for jobs I'm literally going to have a bunch of esoteric math theorems in my brain and at best about 1/2 the knowledge that a pure CS major would have. Like, it doesn't even matter for shit that my current school is \"better\" than the one I could've chose pure CS for, what matters is the knowledge of CS concepts for interview, which I'm going to have jack shit of when I graduate. Plus the fact that some of my general education requirements won't transfer if I transfer schools so I'll likely end up taking much more classes and delaying graduation even more.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me? Honestly my ultimate goal is to work from home in a low stress job. I just got spooked after realizing the lack of career opportunities in pure math, which is really what my major is mostly about. I still remember the story someone told about pure maths job opportunities. It goes like this: \n\n&gt; Once upon a time, there was a person who studied dragons and how to kill them for their entire life, and went on to a dragon slaying college. They met up with the greatest dragon slayers of all time, and graduated with honors from that college. Out in the real world, this person was struggling to find a job slaying dragons. There were no dragons around! so he asked his teacher to give them advice.\n\n&gt; The teacher said, \"teach others how to slay dragons\"\n\nThat's what I feel like I'm gonna be. A middle-aged teacher in the most socially accepted pyramid scheme teaching glorified toddlers and getting sick every month. I do NOT want to be that person.",

Square E, is 25(infinity\\^2), while square D is 16(infinity\\^2). and if you want to find the smallest square, Square A, square A is 1(infinity\\^2). but by using similarities, we can conclude that the similarity between them shares a similar ratio to infinity. E\\~D\\~C\\~B\\~A is like saying infinity\\~infinity\\~infinity\\~infinity\\~infinity, but not necessarily infinity:infinity:infinity:infinity:infinity. but by reducing A to the highest infinity ratio, we can conclude the square root of 25 is 5. and if you look at the squares, i've subdivided them so you can do pixel measurements to deduce that indeed the square root of 16 is 4, the square root of 9 is 3, the square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1 is 1. the only information you needed was the highest square and you can do division and multiplication from there by simply using division and multiplying the dividends by their ratios to find the larger infinity squares. this graph uses infinity\\^2. be weary of that. the infinities are used because there is nothing that supposedly exceeds infinity. so if every line \"exceeds\" infinity, they become similar to each other, but not necessarily equal. D\\^2 is just as large as E\\^2 when talking about infinities, but its impossible to graph on a 2D chart without some modifications. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ug56rupv8oja1.png?width=198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=73358c8ebbbd391c473a7737944ac35525e9287f",

        "text": "So I want to statistically assess whether an educational card game I made improves students' understanding of a topic. Students completed a quiz, then played the card game, then completed the quiz again. As such I have two datasets - a 'before' and an 'after'.\n\nNormally I would expect to run a paired t-test to see if there is a statistically significant improvement in the students' scores. However, some students did not complete the quiz after playing the game (due to having to leave the session early) and so my datasets are not equal sizes. To be more specific, my sample size for the pre-game quiz is 54 and my sample size for the post-game quiz is 45.\n\nDue to anonymity requirements, I also do not know which pre-game score corresponds to which post-game score (i.e. I only have the list of scores, but do not know how much each individual improved by).\n\nWhat test should I run to see if there was a statistically significant improvement in the students' quiz scores, and how would I go about this? Thanks in advance :)",

The proofs of most of the theorems are based directly on previous essential theorems without any neat idea or they are tedious inductions. Trying to prove something feels like reading the problem and sitting back, trying to think of the bigger picture and recall all results you have already seen. Nothing \"clever\" if I dare say. Courses like group theory, galois theory, commutative algebra and many more algebra ones contributed to this idea.\n\nDon't get me wrong thinking that I do not appreciate algebra and its beautiful results; I am talking about their proofs and the whole study of such things.",
