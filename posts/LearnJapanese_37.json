I researched and people said you should learn basic japnese and communication before getting into KANJI. But now my question is how do people communicate with Hiragana if the sound could mean 3 different things.\n\nIsn't KANJI only for writing and doesn't have a sound? So now I am even more confused how this sound could mean 3 things and the only way to know is KANJI but kanji doesn't have a sound???\n\nI am defiantly missing something here plz someone educate me because I'm really confused, does the words around it and how you create the sentence tell you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: The example she gave was  Bridge Chopsticks and  Edge in KANJI but they all have the same sound so how if im speaking to someone would they tell the difference between them without me pulling out paper and writing it in KANJI?",

        "text": "A while back I complained about the lack of options for mining from iOS. That's when /u/pudding321 - the developer of [Game2Text](https://game2text.com/user-guide/improve-accuracy/import-game-scripts/) stepped forward to work on a solution. I have been helping test the app while he developed it, and now that the app is officially available on the app store I can share it here with all of you.\n\nThe app is called Immersion Reader. To describe it in simple terms, it's a wrapper for the [ッツ Reader](https://ttu-ebook.web.app/) web app with a built in lookup feature similar to Yomichan. However, this has some features which makes it much better than reading from ッツ in Safari using 10ten.\n\nFirst of all it's faster/smoother. Anyone who has used 10ten knows it is often a pain to even get it to show up on the webpage. But more importantly, Immersion Reader supports custom dictionaries in the Yomichan format so if you don't like using the default JMdict you can easily add whatever dictionary you like (personally I like to use one 和英 dictionary in combination with one 国語 dictionary).\n\nThe lookups function itself has a really neat feature. Of course there is the basic pitch accent and labels to display which JLPT level a word falls under, but also /u/pudding321 added a really sweet feature that comes into handy if you mis-click. If you swipe left or right then the selection will move to the next or previous character from the one that you clicked on by mistake. For example if you tried to highlight the word 複雑 but you accidentally clicked on 雑 instead of 複, you can just swipe left instead of repeatedly pressing at the word.\n\nAnd most importantly, if you click on the star icon the word will be saved to a list. You can export the saved words to a CSV file which can be imported into your Anki collection using /u/pudding321's Anki add-on [Anki Dojo](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/433778282) or using Anki's native CSV import feature. The generated Anki card will be a vocab card which contains the context sentence where you found the word, and the glossary data from your installed dictionaries (except for those which you have disabled). \n\nThere is also a separate dictionary tab, so you can search words using all of the dictionaries that you have installed.\n\n/u/pudding321 did such a great job on this. A while back I bought an Android e-reader in order to mine from novels, but the experience with Immersion Reader is much smoother so I'm now suffering from buyers remorse! In the future once the dictionary tab is fully expanded I expect that this app can also serve as a full replacement for the many available dictionary apps which run on JMdict. You just can't beat the power of being able to install any dictionary you want... By that time I will probably begin to suffer buyers remorse for my 電子辞書 as well 😅\n\nThe app is in a state where it is ready to check out, [so give it a shot if you're an iOS user.](https://reader.immersionkit.com)\n\n/u/pudding321 plans on developing this projectsome more since it's not 100% completed yet, but he has some great project ideas in store for his next projects so keep an eye out.",

While I find the lessons easier (albeit boring) to follow than other textbooks, I’m frustrated with the inconsistent use of grammar. \n\nFor example, the word 帰る is introduced in Lesson 3. It would first appear in the lesson’s dialogue with hiragana readings, which is okay. However, when the same word appears in subsequent lessons’ writing practices (the ones at the back of the textbook itself), it would be in its hiragana form かえる and not the kanji 帰る. I find this annoying since we have already learnt this word (and how to write it in kanji) previously - why can’t they just be consistent and use the kanji continuously throughout? There are also other examples of their inconsistent use of kanji throughout the textbooks and workbooks that annoy me too. \n\nAnyone feeling the same? I still love Genki though! Just wished they could improve on this. \n\nP.S. If anyone is using Genki at the moment, please share how your study routine is like! Do you guys use any other books to supplement like 単語 for vocabulary? Do you guys religiously memorise the vocabulary in Genki itself? Let me know :)",

If I pay attention I can understand most daily conversation with no problem, however, I am absolutely terrible at speaking. I live in Japan and my husband is bilingual but prefers speaking English, and I'm a mix of too busy to meet new people and too shy to put myself out there, but we recently found out we are expecting our first child, so I really need to spend the next 7 months grinding my speaking ability so I can take my kid to the doctor and daycare without needing my husbands help. I really like my Bunpro / Nativshark system ( I also use Satori Reader and Marugoto sometimes to get variety) and I am very self motivated to study on my own. I also tried Italki, however I feel like I need something similarly structured for speaking because my Italki teachers kinda just spoke English the whole time :/\n\nI am considering Akira Online and Akamonkai courses, (thoughts?) which seem to be similarly priced for an intensive course of 5-8 lessons per week. I am quitting my job in mid January so want to really buckle down with the daily lessons starting around then and would love recommendations. Cheers!",

Or is all I can do just hope that I’ll recognize something written in kana right away? And is this something they’re doing to try to make the test harder..?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/yu9rcw/question_about_the_n4_is_the_tests_reliance_on/",
        "text": "So, a bit of backstory:\n\nA while ago I had made a post asking if I was dumb for having difficulty answering N5 practice questions, because paragraphs were written almost entirely in hiragana and all of the homophones were getting me tripped up. I had already signed up to take the N4, but I figured it could be a good idea to start from N5 sample questions instead to begin with. At that point I had already memorized a few hundred kanji and vocab readings and meanings, so I was like “this is supposed to be easy...”. But for a bunch of the words I knew multiple things pronounced / spelled the same way phonetically and didn’t have any reliable way to tell what was what without the kanji for the words.\n\nSurprisingly to me, most of the replies were like “yeah reading hiragana is hard when you know how to read kanji” which did made me feel better. Someone suggested that I would be better off just focusing on N4 practice questions because they would be more likely to use more kanji (and a better use of my time), but warned that while N4 likely would use MORE kanji than N5, I still might run into that same kana-only issue that I came across before (to a lesser extent).\n\nFast forward months later to present day. Yesterday I gave the JLPT’s official N4 practice questions a try (they have like, 12 total on their site), and for one of them, it was basically a massive paragraph that you’re supposed to answer a really basic question about after reading it over. So it’s the generic standardized test thing of “here’s a great deal of information, determine what’s bs and ignore that stuff and pluck out the one bit of relevant info for your answer”. \n\nThere was a word I didn’t recognize (unfortunately within the actual question about the paragraph), but I figured I could determine what it was from context clues (I couldn’t lol). \nBUT, the *bigger* issue proved however to be that the paragraph kept using this word, じゅうしょ, over and over again and I had no clue what it meant (knowing this likely would’ve helped me guess what the word I didn’t know in the question meant). Now, looking back on it knowing the answer, this IS a word I learned a while ago and just forgot. I know now that it’s 住所 and means like, residence. The paragraph was talking about what people did when moving into this particular apartment building in Japan (basically, leaving gifts and notes for new arrivals / neighbors). The question about the paragraph had a word I didn’t recognize, one that meant something like “habit”. So it was basically asking what the habit was for people in the building to do for newcomers.\n\nBut like... why was じゅうしょ not written like 住所? Hell, even if I forgot the word itself or how to say or pronounce it, I would’ve 100% been able to figure out what the word meant and what the paragraph was talking about just by recognizing those kanji in it. It’s not as though the paragraph was *entirely* in kana, there were a decent number of kanji mixed in (with furigana over many of them, for some reason), definitely way more than if this were an N5 level question. I just want to understand... was this a deliberate choice by the test creators, and, if so, is this a choice to make it more challenging, or is it only more challenging to me in particular because of how I’ve learned thus far?\n\nFor clarification, I haven’t followed a standard, school curriculum or something. I memorized hiragana and katakana with Duolingo, then afterwards I started using WaniKani for kanji and vocab (I’m currently level 22) and I’ve gone through the N5 and N4 paths of BunPro and am now practicing that grammar material. So, is reading じゅうしょ and understanding it something I would have an easier time doing if I didn’t recognize as many kanji as I do? \n\nI feel as though I’m at some weird ironic disadvantage by being in some ways overqualified for the test I’m taking while also under-qualified in others (because I still have a lot to work on and practice when it comes to grammar to get that stuff down. I’m not even certain I know every grammar point that could appear on the test despite BunPro saying I’ve gone through all the N4 level stuff). \n\nI’m DEFINITELY not at N3 level skill or comprehension wise, but I think there’s the potential for me to do poorly on N4 for this reason (this whole bare minimum kanji usage thing) when at very least with the kanji usage part I may be better off if I were viewing more challenging paragraphs using more of them. Idk. \n\nTo be fair, jisho.org is telling me that there’s very few words that are spelled the same way as じゅうしょ, and that most of them are either adjacent to the idea of residency / someone’s address, close enough that I SHOULD be able to guess it from context if I had remembered its spelling, because the other ones are super far off and unrelated (really specific medical conditions) that there’s 0 chance they’d use it. So, maybe they chose to write it out phonetically and not use kanji because they just assumed the reader would know what the only reasonable じゅうしょ would be that’d be used by them? Maybe?\n\n*The TLDR basically is, I’m taking the JLPT N4, and while it features more kanji usage than N5, it still relies a lot on kana, more so than more difficult reading material likely would, which puts me in an awkward spot where I’m only grammatically capable of understanding stuff at this difficulty level, but at the same time am above the difficulty level with vocab / kanji knowledge. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for heavily kana-reliant questions when I take the test? Or do I just have to cross my fingers and pray that, when questions do feature words written phonetically that I know 5 potential definitions for, that I remember the meaning more readily and it isn’t a problem?*\n\nI know that was a lot to read, so I appreciate it a lot if you did read it and as always I appreciate feedback.
