        "text": "Basically the title. I'm currently on episode 1010 and so far Yamato has slightly intrigued but mostly annoyed me. Her insistence that she's \"Oden,\" especially to Momonosuke's face was completely ridiculous and even though I'm sure she's been abused for years and has a great motive for wanting to be \"like\" Oden, it still doesn't excuse her pretending to \"be\" someone else. I've otherwise been really enjoying the Wano arc, and there've been some awesome moments in just the last few episodes. I knew that she'd show up, but had no clue she'd be pretending to \"be\" Odin, just that she'd be sympathetic to the Kozuki cause. This whole calling her 'young master,' and 'he,' and everyone humoring her Oden obsession for some reason makes no sense and makes her more annoying than interesting. If she really reveres Oden and wants to make his dream a reality, what part of that mandates HER being him?! Especially now that she knows that the Akazaya Nine and Momo are alive, she should realize that they do and will NOT see her as the master they served. None of them like Kin'emon would never go so far as to claim to even be Oden's successor, but going up to a boy (who basically just lost both his parents a few months ago in his view) and saying, \"hey, I'm totally a girl but believe me, I'm your Dad, I'm totally your Father.\" Would be both confusing and (probably) cause him renewed grief, like ripping open an old wound *cough* Kaido *cough*\n\nThis has been one of the sole things sucking the enjoyment out of this arc for my Dad and me. I wish she would recognize that she's her own person. This goes beyond something like cosplay and has entered mental illness territory... does she get any better going forward?",

        "text": "Hey guys, I wanna share with you the partial result of my summer vacation (southern hemisphere) project. Once I got me thinking \"how many named characters there are in One Piece?\", and then I set out to find this out. Actually, it turned out that I created something more refined. I don't know if something like this already exists but nevertheless I had fun doing it. I made a huge character x chapter table sheet to check everytime every character appears in every chapter.\n\nThe first difficulty is to define what exactly counts as an appearance, since as you know, there are many instances of that: cover stories, flashbacks, reference-image, silhouette, etc. The second issue was that as the number of columns kept getting bigger and bigger it got impracticable to keep filling the cells just as I read the chapters, so I eventually sumonned wiki's aid. So, in the current state of affairs, I am not distinguishing any of those forms of appearances.\n\nRegarding the second line of the sheet, it is an rough attempt to single out characters I deem as of \"Low\" relevance, such as background characters named in  databooks and the likes. As of right now, this is entirely subjective and not completely cohetent, but perhaps it can be made objective and precise in the future. Summing up, the number in A3 is the total number of named character entries so far, below it it's the number of \"low relevance\" characters, and in A5 the difference between then, hence, the amount of \"high relevance\" characters.\n\nWith no further ado, here is the link to the sheet. I'll leave it open for comments in case anyone wants to help me correct the many many flaws it certainly has.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hty9pt3WYOR_vpgiuqC4XRlA3ZBVtHqd4xrkDYKJQws/edit?usp=drivesdk",

        "text": "As we all know, Kid is about to face a losing battle against Shanks on Elbaf.....well that's what Oda wants us to think at least. \n\nEveryone usually levels up after a life threatening battle. So we should see some major improvements after facing off with two Emperors of the Sea.\n\nThere is much more to Kid's devil fruit ability that he hasn't shown yet. Like let's say creating a magnetic field that disrupts brain waves aka electromagnetic waves.\n\nStudies have shown that magnetism can **change the flow of blood in the brain, and turn off neuron groups**. Some under the influence of high magnetic fields have caused people to have violent seizures, and even lose consciousness, slip into comas, and die. **Electricity is everywhere, even in the human body**. Our cells are specialized to conduct electrical currents. Electricity is required for the nervous system to send signals throughout the body and to the brain, making it possible for us to move, think and feel. If Captain Kid has figured out how to disrupt those signals were gonna be in for a BIG SHOW.\n\nIt would be an extremely overpowered ability that not even Shanks could shake off easily. Being able to mess with someones heart or brain would cripple anyone immediately. I can understand better now why Oda would nerf Kid by taking one of his arms and giving him a slow evolution process. Being able to create magnetic fields to kill your enemy is just too much too soon.\n\nThe fact is this whole idea had me thinking this is may be why the Red Hair Pirates took his arm to begin with. What if he needed both hands to use this ability but as soon as he showed signs of this awakened power, Ben Beckman or another took his arm to stop him. If that's true then maybe after his battle on Onigashima and after he's had time to heal and regain his strength he's figured out how to use this ability to its fullest. \n\nJust imagine now if Kid can fuse his devil fruit with Haki like Luffy. All I can see now is some major Electromagnetic Haki clashes with Shanks Wifi Haki. Wouldn't that make this fight worth while now?\n\nEither way things won't go the way people expect. Ch 1077 is going to be really special. Get Ready.\n\n[CHAPTER 1076](https://preview.redd.it/n74t14egs1ma1.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=316cbd1dfeeef4b1ac178deadce638ff5c470b01)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11jlkc3/not_mine_theory_on_the_one_piece_being_binks_sake/",
        "text": "This isn't my theory, but I really hope it ends up being true because its so compelling and tearful. \n\nI did research on the mega theory about the One Piece which I don't remember the name of. It states that the One Piece itself, is actually Bink's Sake, and I believe it's multi layered symbolism. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more it makes sense.\n\nJoyboy's legacy left a memorial to pirate freedom - a song, and a cup of Sake. Every time we see Sake in the story, it's crucial. Partying and laughter, celebration, community and friendship, loyalty, etc. Sake is what symbolises pirate's freedom.\n\nAce, Sabo and Luffy used Sake to form their bond as brothers. So many notable characters in both times of joy, celebration and happiness, and sadness, pain and dispair sing the song. It has so much importance in the series that I believe, has yet to unveil itself fully. \n\nBink's Sake is something more though. It's a song about freedom, laughter, joy, being with your friends, and embarking on a journey. It's stated in the series that the song brings Joy to dire situations. \n\nWhere there is sadness and dispair, Bink's Sake will be delivered to reignite the Joy, spirit and laughter in people. It's just beautiful. \n\nMusic brings people together in One Piece, whether it's around a fire in the woods, on the deck of a ship, or on the dance floor of a hall and banquet. \n\nMusic and Sake/wine/beer (doesn't matter what drink) bring people together in our world too. Whether you're going to a festival or dance club with friends to have fun, a concert, or sharing memories and moments with your friends with some quiet drinks and music at home. Where you can let go of any issues, dispair, or conflict, and cheers to a drink with friends, enemies or rivals. \n\nThe most important bits of evidence however is Bink's Sake itself, the song. Roger and his crew sung it on the way to laugh tale, and throughout their journey. They were laughing, drinking, having fun and partying all the way to laugh tale, quite literally, being a laugh... Tale itself. Brook and his crew also sang in when starting their journey in the grand line. It even rang joy to Laboom, the whale. Brook once again sang it with the Straw Hats at the Banquet while playing ont he piano and crying with happiness that Joy has once again entered his life. \n\nOf course the Roger pirates laughed when they saw laughtale and the one piece. Bink's Sake is a symbol of what they have been singing and drinking this whole time. The one piece isn't necessarily laughter and joy, but it symbolises and brings those things. \n\nIf you actually read the lyrics, there is heavy symbolism of freedom, spirit, awaiting the morning sun, and laughter. I want to highlight some important things in the song. The waiting for the morning sun specifically is important. The sun brings joy, happiness and hope, hence why Joyboy is also known to be \"sun god Nika\". Although times are sad, difficult and painful, the song is a way to say \"just hang on there a little longer, and make do with the friends you have around you, for the sun will rise again, and your dispair will be replaced with joy\". \n\nBrook is actually important to what the One Piece represents. There is a line at the end (excuse the translation as it's from The wiki and inaccurate) saying \"doesn't matter who you are, someday you'll be bones.\"\n\nIt sounds depressing at first, until you realise Brook who perfectly represents this line is so joyful and always laughing with his yohohoho. \n\nIn One piece, Sake is about loyalty as well. Is it a coincidence that (presumably) Roger died, Yonko and their allies share a cup of Sake to form a bond of loyalty and friendship?? Its tradition in One Piece, and Luffy did this too. But when Luffy did it, his terms were, rather than his fleet serving under him, they'd stand with him side by side and help each other. The reincarnation of Joyboy himself said that... \n\nBink's Sake is not just a song, or drink. Bink's Sake symbolises freedom, joy, laughter, and endurance in times of happiness and dispair. Bink's reminds us of our friends, journey and passed loved ones which we continue to commemorate. It's about having fun, embarking on a journey, and following your individual and collective dreams together. Its even a way of letting by gones be by gones, and making peace with your passed enemies, who will become your friends. Its Joyboy's style, its Luffy's style, and its absolutely Oda's style. \n\nWhat do you guys think about this theory? The moment I heard it, I was sold, and it's only making more and more sense as I think about it more.",

They do sound like a pun.\n\nReborn was published from 2004 to 2012, while One Piece started earlier in 1997.\n\nIn Reborn, they have Sun flames, sky flames, storm flames.\n\nTsuna is the sky, Ryohei is the sun, and Gokudera is the storm. Ryohei is passionate and Gokudera is calm. Sanji has both characteristics but he‚Äôs more passionate than Zoro emotionally. Gokudera is the right hand man of the boss. The difference is Luffy is the sun and Zoro uses storm attacks but there‚Äôs not really a 1 to 1 analogy so I won‚Äôt force it. Tsuna and the Vongola are mafiosos that aren‚Äôt really mafia while Luffy and the Straw Hats are pirates that aren‚Äôt really like pirates.

This idea was always a little hard for me to fully grasp how it'd work, now obviously there is likely more to devil fruits then this but Zoro's Asura form might be a hint to how this works.\n\nZoro's Asura form has never been fully explained, the closest we got is that he uses conqueror's haki while using it which really ain't much. However, Zoro's Asura form could be a real time example of a devil fruit being willed into existence, like in the distant future of one piece, long after Zoro dies from old age or something, there could be a \"Mythical Zoan Hito Hito no Mi: Model Asura\"",

It‚Äôs not someone we know a lot about or seen a lot about‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well in his human for but I think nami father is Spencer from the roger pirates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9spjkfaevzla1.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ecbb21e8df234cb80bc81b2c8dcb9c64909229b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60jozfaevzla1.jpg?width=180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f4852003ebb667ede8aa836f549001d75e6c717\n\nwell despite the fact he looks like a male nami.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wxd00hil0ma1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=36314ce9ed51af91eaac47183960d2e1637d072f\n\nthere is another connection, A Spencer is a a navigational tool used on ships.\n\nthere is another connection, A Spencer is a a navigational  gaff rigged sail hoisted in place of a larger mainsail when winds are very high. The trysail provides enough thrust to maintain control of the ship, e.g. to avoid ship damage, and to keep the bow to the wind. It is hoisted abaft (i.e., directly behind) the mainmast (taking the place of the much larger mainsail) or, on a brig, abaft the foremast. A trysail is analogous to a storm jib.‚Äù\n\nThere is also another funny parallel.  Spencer is also a word for someone whose job it is to hand out money and provisions it evolved into the word dispenser.  Nami is usually the one who hands out allowances to the crew.\n\nSo Spencer is nami father who cares? Well I say it is important as Spencer has been in our face for quite some time Spencer no longer goes by his name or face and now is better known as‚Ä¶.Big News Morgans.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/giy40cxnzzla1.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d1a4ceffb1d48254c8d6e949a1a5a6cd7e9d4797\n\nthis is all hinted at in chapter 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/la5u726tzzla1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5ed9c2d38288a4a87df91ee2326beab762f2db7\n\nin the picture nami is bonding with a albatross/seagull and there is a few things.\n\nFirst off it‚Äôs dressed up as a marine which could be a reference to bell-m√®re nami adoptive mother. ( her name is French for step mother and also mere in Norse means sea )\n\nhowever next to nami is a straw hat on a postal box. This is a reference to Spencer who according to this theory is a roger pirate ( straw hat ) who now commands birds to go around delivering news papers ( postal box )\n\nnow Morgan is also a French name which originated in the Celtic times.\n\nIn Gaelic ( language of Ireland) and france the name Morgan means ‚Äú born of the sea ‚Äù \n\nnow Morgan is a very stingy character. He‚Äôs always chasing a big story and writing it however he wants truth or lie as long as it makes him money, reminds me of nami.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikv4h86f50ma1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f080e317fe44802f93a627fbf032204736e78b80\n\nhowever nami and morgan are not so greedy when it comes to what is really important.\n\nIn sabaody nami was willing to part with all her money to save camie no question only to be instantly out bid by a celestial dragon before eve making an offer.\n\nas for Morgan he is greedy and a liar  but he has his pride as a journalist like when he refused a check in order to publish a story and apparently the bribe was big.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhk9vm5l60ma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=89b9c83495e7099f3787ffc00be60a277ad4450c\n\nnami and Morgans are also a lot stronger than they look while probably not the strongest person there is he did knock out a cp agent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2275cr3z60ma1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=826c62574fdb69ee132285b2d4a178d63f797400\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yr8swr3z60ma1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=de6b17ccc7e44664a012387b6647b3a1402ace66\n\nmorgans also seems to be well loved by his workers showing that he must be a good boss to work for and treats his staff with respect while demanding hard work.\n\nNow Morgans is always in his hybrid form which is odd as we never see anyone do that except for chopper who really just does it for merchandise. So I think the reason Morgans is always in hybrid form is oda way of telling us that his human form is important and there is a reason he can‚Äôt reveal it.\n\nmorgan is also a albatross user and albatrosses and seagulls are sea birds and also navigational birds.  Sailors lost at sea would use the seagul or albatross as a sign they are near land and would follow them until they brought them back to land.\n\n  \nanother interesting detail is that nami is connected to the news paper. Besides the last bounty update when it was robin who read the paper, ( probably because nami would mention Koby and robin for some reason tends not to share important information unless asked ) nami is always the one who reads out the news \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tj7vfeck0ma1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60edcd7dad2d865306920cc40c5c7d947e56a5d6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orv9kfeck0ma1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a387a58221b36f4140e449c89d489071180d95c4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93fj0geck0ma1.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bcf4f503890b34bf3544f0505f4e3b4f3d9c5c8e\n\nAnd in chapter 96 we see her arguing with a albatross and threatening it for the outrages price it was asking for the news paper which was 100 berri which if in yen would be 0.69 cent in euro or 0.74 cent in dollar,  demonstrating how much of a SCROOGE! nami was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozf18cfwk0ma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=91d99bc9f689750a3eae4499798d872023da2769\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow I believe morgans has been helping Luffy in his own way for some time. Maybe not helping him but using luffy as a means of passing on a message to the world because something that is odd is that luffy bounty has the D in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unwudj7v80ma1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b2c13e193d31d9db4453fccb4cca99e7e8f9561\n\nthis is odd as we are told that rogers bounty poster was gold roger not gol D roger.\n\nNow as for as I am aware we never seen blackbeards Poster in tact which might mean luffy is the only one with the D in his poster as we know laws poster Misses it and I believe Kid is a D,  shanks and kaido might also be D clan but their posters are just shanks and kaido no family name.\n\nPerhaps someone who works with the news published this to correct what happened to roger who didn‚Äôt really like being called Gold roger.\n\nMorgans seems to take a special interest in the supernova believing they have the potential to become pirate king\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tstt0a5ac0ma1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e038ea495f0056e021861d5a9d6644d78b5744aa\n\nhe is making sure the world sees them but also makes sure the world sees luffy in particular.  Now he did recently publish a story that make it look like luffy kidnapped vegapunk so thats not very helpful but I never said he was trying to make luffy look good but also he did say this will make the wg happy so perhaps he is trying to get back in their good graces after beating up a agent and publishing a story that made them look bad.\n\nbut to prove his also not all bad for some reason he agreed to help vivi and is hiding her on his ship. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9uhgcb9d0ma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=872d6c48d51c6ea19b5529c264bc827b3f8387f8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nueotdb9d0ma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a1b3364d677c5bef48f785c037109988f29947a7\n\nso Morgan is a former roger pirate and father to nami.\n\nNow is he just a bad father not trying to reach out to his daughter well maybe he is an absentee father that does seem to be the default setting however keep in mind Morgan should believe nami is dead. the island Oykot where she is from was attacked about 20 years ago and nami was taken by bell-m√©re and probably renamed since now would she know nami real name.  So there really isn‚Äôt any reason to even suspect nami is his daughter and yes as a journalist he could probably investigate but what would be his motivation to think she is his daughter after all these years just cause she is what ? Orange haired  ?\n\nwe to this day do not know nami real name.\n\nNow I mentioned Morgan is Celtic/ french for born of the sea right well this is important.\n\nIn the recent sbs which is what led me to chapter 49 which got me suspicious of nami being Morgan daughter which was a theory i nearly gave up on.\n\nnow in the recent sbs it was revealed zoro mother name is Terra which means earth in several languages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tnakrh36h0ma1.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f05eac2d77ade02c439c9fcee2a2f9b218ee2e0c\n\nthis is relevant because sanji mother is named sora which means sky.\n\nnami means wavein Japanese and Morgan means born of the sea   \nso nami name would be Morgans nami unless her real name is morgans umi.\n\numi means sea in Japanese.\n\nnow this is interesting.\n\nluffy is the sun god. Maybe his mother name is solar.\n\nzoro is the son of earth\n\nsanji is the son of the sky \n\nnami is the daughter of the sea.\n\nthe missing piece is ussop. We don‚Äôt know his full name,  it‚Äôs believed he‚Äôs a Mont Blanc but we don‚Äôt know his actual name as if he was a Mont blanc he would have said something about it so it‚Äôs probably a name his family doesn‚Äôt go by anyway.\n\nanyway I believe ussop following this theme is the moon to the group.  After all the moon reflects the light from the sun and that can be said of ussop who often shines thanks to luffy.\n\nIn chapter 96 the same chapter we see nami reading the newspaper and threatening the albatross luffy gets his first bounty and can see ussop in the background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l546gzlcj0ma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=94a32a949577954f9849584e40f2cbfd33eace03\n\nso again that‚Äôs luffy =sun\n\nzoro = earth\n\nsanji = sky\n\nnami = the sea \n\nussop = the moon.\n\nthe east blue 5.\n\nluffy and his true 4 commanders ( sorry jinbei )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5momhefcl0ma1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2f0aa76e886acaac1cf5ee675c79fae8a812227",

Joyboy‚Äôs wish was to be a rubber man, but a rubber-fruit was not brought in to existence. Not enough people had the desire to be made out of rubber. So Joyboy created this completely made-up character named Nika, a rubber man. He made enough people believe that Nika was the sun god, and so the desire to become Nika was growing. Eventually the Hito-Hito no mi model: Nika was born. Joyboy ended up eating this fruit and became a rubber man. The end :)",

        "text": "Here's a fun tie of two characters who may be more involved in each other's pasts than we thought.  Maybe its been brought up before since the chapter came out, but I haven't seen it.\n\nWith the confirmed reveal that Kuma was a slave, the thing that comes to mind for me is how he was actually introduced into the story and how long Oda actually planned the outline of his backstory.  Kuma is introduced at the same time as Doflamingo, directly tying a Celestial Dragon and a slave of the Celestials together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dbsa3o670ma1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7919b1dba232a74ed8116d0436eb91626d1315ed\n\nThis connection between the two of them with hindsight sticks out as very noteworthy.  But it also begs the question; how did Kuma go from being beaten by fellow slaves to return home to becoming King of an entire nation in Sorbet Kingdom.  That's a pretty incredible rise to power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/darixlifa0ma1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4379d894e8ad67e767bfac4971c7543648d1ae73\n\nWhat if Kuma and Doffy have closer ties than we thought?  What if Kuma was actually a slave of the Donquixote family?  And the reason Kuma was no longer a slave is because Homing freed all of his slaves when he left the Holy Land.  Kuma would have been 14 at this point and Doflamingo would have been 8.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaaut524b0ma1.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=54d138a75636ac38ec8ed596a03b5a5efa7215f7\n\nSo again, how did Kuma become King of a nation from life as a slave?  Well what if he didn't join a nation.  What if he created one?\n\nOda has given us a drawing of Kuma (and all the Shichibukai) as children.  Kuma is in tattered clothes carrying wood and a book that says Ninokin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxf8h5cgc0ma1.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=57ff5e104d12f6fc71f97303f644093c8305620c\n\nNinokin in all likelihood refers to [Ninomiya Sontoku, or Ninomiya Kinjiro.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninomiya_Sontoku)  Stop me if this sounds like it might mean something with context to One Piece and Kuma.\n\n&gt;Ninomiya Sontoku was born to a poor peasant family with a name of Kinjiro in Kayama (Ê†¢Â±±), Ashigarakami-gun, Sagami province. His father died when he was 14 and his mother died two years later. He was then placed in his uncle's household.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While working on his uncle's land, Sontoku studied on his own. He later obtained abandoned land on his own and transformed it into agricultural land, eventually restoring his household on his own at the age of 20. He achieved considerable wealth as a landlord while in his 20s. He was then recruited to run a small feudal district which was facing considerable financial difficulty. He achieved this by reviving the local economy, particularly through agricultural development. The daimy≈ç, hearing of his achievement, eventually recruited Sontoku to run Odawara Domain then Sagami Province.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; It is said that during his administration a famine struck Odawara. Sontoku proposed opening up the public granaries to feed the starving populace. He was opposed by his fellow bureaucrats who reminded him that permission had to be granted by the sh≈çgun for commoners to have access to the rice stores. In that case, Sontoku replied, no one, including the bureaucrats, could eat the public rice before getting the sh≈çgun's approval. They quickly changed their minds and decided that, since it was an emergency, the people should be fed immediately. He was eventually entrusted with one of the shogunate's estates, which was a great honor for someone of his low origin. \n\nSo put it all together and tie it back to One Piece.\n\n* Kuma was a Donquixote slave that was released at 14 when Homing left the Holy Land\n* He built up Sorbet Kingdom, named after the ingredients which would be the agricultural land Kuma founded\n* Maybe Kuma refused to pay the Heavenly Tribute, needing that money to support the land through a famine\n* The World Government turned that refusal into an explanation for why the country was in a famine, pinning the entire thing on Kuma\n\nAnd just to tie it all back to Doflamingo, how did Doflamingo become a Warlord?  By attacking Heavenly Tribute ships 10 years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xnn29hjef0ma1.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=306ddc2d979d757b570a2830d2903169794bc41a\n\nI could be missing on some details here, but I really think there's some substance to this and how Kuma could have gone from being a slave to being a King.  Let me know what you think.",

It is the reason for the visits from Cipher Pol, they were investigating him. I thought it was the opposite that the disappearance Cipher Pol agents to draw suspicion against Vegapunk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtjo0bpqozla1.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5deb82557c7db2460d8b968e30b2212075694a1\n\nI believe the person behind this is PX-1, presumably the first clone of Kuma that Vegapunk created. One reason to go after Vegapunk would be for a grudge. And the people he experimented most likely would have one against him. Kuma sent him to unknown location and his status is unknown.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3frqupqtozla1.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=97ffd0130b4bc07c9d2e137cc9ea17cdc481fa20\n\nThe first successful clone Vegapunk created, Stussy, made a appearance. It would be interesting juxtaposition since one clone he gave free will and other he took away. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le9u8zbvozla1.png?width=285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=466c4516335cbc426a8bd96e556c3423c6830f03\n\nKuma has the reputation of being a vicious pirate. This brutal side of him hasn't been seen and all of his loved ones vouch for him as kind, good person. But with Bonney she specifically said he wasn't an evil king nothing of him as a pirate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6yo3n3xozla1.png?width=221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=66ccbc51285b67a5871c5d37dd9b700ee25fac0f\n\nWith Kuma's traumatic childhood it's not hard to see how he could of become vicious as an adult. I think maybe we will see this brutal side through one of his clones, PX-1.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/da3vbykyozla1.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d72f39ff20337c9ddc411b798e98ed51751fc6ca\n\nPythagoras speculated that bloodline elements record an individual's experiences. Which makes be believe that it is possible that Kuma's clones have his memories.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bx05xlf0pzla1.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=802ec7cb505402fd6f059b5b6193cda5c16d8e2d\n\nAtlas revealed that she can alter her appearance and body however she wants. She states that is the future is like.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r964f6y5uzla1.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9e1861419dfbc080ac8a5ac8a1c1f7cce0992d23\n\nIt seems like that is the case for NPCS we see on Egghead. Some of them look like cyborgs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3tsdzbouzla1.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a6636bf885b289fda6710de2c9667449af93d9a4\n\nI think PX-1 altered his appearance and is the police guard that Luffy and co. ran into. This guard is only seen once and hasn't shown up even though Egghead was attacked.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7qngla3pzla1.png?width=271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c2466dc33f4dc56ba4593a80c838fd28e29e2b01\n\nStella got a glimpse of the perpetration and he doesn't look like a Pacifista. But Oda's silhouettes aren't always accurate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5gi40qbszla1.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=25949eadf461ed56214165d3d1516705f7960236\n\nThis isn't a hot take but Kuma always reminded me of the Tin Man.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd2x8scszla1.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=62e51ab9f58260800e64853e7de56c2af15a1b67\n\nIt was mentioned that one mythical place is the Emerald City which is from the Wizard of Oz. Maybe Kuma sent PX-1 to Emerald City and he found his humanity.",
