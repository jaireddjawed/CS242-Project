        "text": "This does not apply to everyone, and I'm not a financial advisor etc etc, so just consider it some potentially helpful food for thought.\n\nSay you have a loan that will take you 10 years to pay off, with an interest rate of 5% (if the loan will take longer to pay off, even better).\n\nMeanwhile, a large cap ETF (like Vanguard Large-Cap, as an example) is a high growth mutual fund whose value will fluctuate a lot in the short term but generally get great returns over time. This example ETF has averaged 9.71% annual return for the last 30 years (there are plenty of comparable ones, do your research).\n\nIf you take every dollar that you *would have* put towards the student loan (beyond the minimum payment), and instead invest it in a reliable ETF you feel confident in, then you tend to earn more from the investment than you lose on loan interest rates.\n\nI did the math for my own situation (I made the decision to do this right out of college nearly a decade ago - I'll simplify the numbers so let's say $100 in the ETF for every $100 minimum payment), and have ended up with well over a thousand dollars more than I would have had if I'd simply paid off the loans.\n\nA related example: say you sell your car or something and now you have X thousand dollars. Putting that into a long term investment can end up being a better decision than putting it all towards your remaining loans, especially because it has more time to grow than a gradual series of ETF purchases.\n\n**Caveats**:\n\n1) If you earn so little that even making the minimum payment is difficult, you should probably ignore this post. You don't want to get what little money you have tied up in stocks that might drop in value when you suddenly need it. Buffer funds are needed.\n\n2) Some loans have closer to 10% interest rates, so the benefits here are less certain in those instances.\n\n3) Don't depend on selling these ETFs at any particular point in time. It might suddenly drop at the 10 year mark, so you'd have to wait for the market to recover before selling.\n\nThere are probably more caveats, so feel free to add them in comments. I studied enough finance to make this work for me but I'm **not** legally qualified to tell you what to do with your money - every situation is different so take it all with a grain of salt. You'd have to do the math for your own situation.",
