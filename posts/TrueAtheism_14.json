        "text": "I know i've probably already said it all in the title but I just feel like I need to say it to someone, to at least make sure i'm not going crazy.\n\nI've spent my whole life around religious people. When I was younger my family were more fervent belivers, but after our uncle who was a pastor cheated on his wife it all slowly fell and while a lot of them still attend church, I haven't been able to go in years.\n\nI don't want to say i've always been smart, that just sounds douchey. But i will say that i've always had critical thinking skills. So I knew that just assuming that God made everything in his basement in one week for a science fair project was a stupid claim. So even from the beginning I was more open to the Big Bang naritive. I always hated that day in science class when evolution had to be discussed. Growing up in the bible belt only made it cringier. My atheist friends all of a sudden became edgy and almost rude, while my theist friends did the same, only with a more \"nose in the air\" type of attitude. I always hated those days in science classes because I actually liked science specifically caves, and the fact that it takes MILLIONS of years for something so beautiful to form fascinates me, but that's a topic for another post. In those days I tried to tell myself that \n\n\"yeah the Genesis story is bull but the more historical parts of the bible, like about the tribes of israel and stuff are more crucial to my faith\"\n\nLater on in college I started reading on flood myths in some of my history classes ( another favorite subject of mine) and even began reading into how Christmas, and Easter have more pagan roots than they do christian or hebrew roots. Also learning the NUMEROUS translations of the bible, yet my own family firmly believing that KJV translation was the definitive word of God, even though it went from Aramaic, to Hebrew, to Greek, to Latin, to German, to French, to Dutch, to English, to a REVISEd English, and then Finally to KJV Not to mention the thousands of Gospels of Jesus's story that are not included in the biblical canon. \n\nYet I convinced myself \n\n\"Faith is different than believing\" I have \"FAITH\" that the Bible is correct which is more akin to blind hope that it is right.\n\nAnd now here I am I've been studying psychology a lot lately and have began to notice that Religion has more demands than it does rewards. It requires more work than it is worth. And I'm beginning to ask myself,\n\nAm I simply too educated to believe in God?\n\nI don't dislike my theist friends, and there are some parts of religious culture that are enjoyable. Some traditional gospel music can be rather lovely. Many churches do plenty of outreach to communities. Everything from scholarships, to soup kitchens have been raised in the name of christ. \n\nYet I know weapons are raised in the name of christ as well. Which the bible kind of rides the fence on that issue. One verse will champion peace while another will command you to bathe in the blood of your enemy. I also know that many people use Religion as a means of political gain, and also it creeps in to school curriculum, which I find absolutely wrong. There is no reason to teach ignorance as the truth, simply because we've always done it that way.\n\nI feel like my mind is already made up on how I feel, then again, I know I could potentially lose friends and family of mine were I to tell them ( which i don't think i would do)  \n\nSaying \" God is not real \" is not a hard sale.\n\nMy mind is completely comfortable with the logic.\n\nBut I can't imagine the heart break my family would see it as were they to find out. To them it wouldn't be a change to more rational thinking, it would be a decision on my eternity. And I know that the eternity in heaven bit is false but it is such a comfort to hear my grandmother talk about it. She sounds so at peace when she gives me her engagement ring to keep and she says, \" We won't need jewelry in heaven \"\n\nIt's been on my mind for quite some time. I'd love to just be free of the burden that religion has put on my mind. I'm just worried of what the consequences that this change in my life might bring.\n\n[**TL;DR** it's 4 am and i'm losing my religion, tips?, tricks?, Consequences?] also i know theres probably plenty of grammar mistakes, I apologize just tell me and i'll correct it and/or clarify for you.\n\n**EDIT** thanks for the help guys knowing i'm not alone makes a difference. And It makes sense to try and keep it on the down low for a while, and ultimately maybe even keep it from my more religious family members all together. I've been watching a few of the \"deconversion\" stories on youtube, and seems that there are quite a few similar to me. Thanks for the love guys.",

And for the Atheist, it is one of the easiest quick win against Christian because most wouldn't be sufficiently equipped to answer this. So this is my plea:\n\n1. Ask a Christian to read [Judges 19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+19-21) with you.\n\n2. Ask them to explain that passage to you.\n\n* Why so much violence? Why did God let this happen? (Theodicy)\n* What the bible is trying to teach?\n* What is God's purpose behind all this?\n* What does this passage tell us about God?\n* It seems that they are as evil as Sodom and Gomorrah, why God punished Sodom and Gomorrah but not this town?\n* Why didn't God let then lose in the first two battles, when he explicitly told them to.\n\nThree chapters is short, considering that if one would like to finish the entire bible in a year, they have to read four chapters a day. It is one of the most brutal piece of narrative by any standards. \n\nEDIT: my instruction was not clear enough, thanks to: /u/conitation ",

        "text": "In my opinion, the fundamental problem facing the atheist/secular movement is the lack of a moral framework necessary for a stable complex society. Haidt's research on the [foundations of moral psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_foundations_theory#The_six_foundations) suggests that rather than purely rational cost-benefit calculations, our moral intuitions are ingrained, emotional biases that evolved for specific purposes in our ancestral environment. He identifies six axes: Care vs Harm, fairness vs cheating, liberty vs oppression, in-group loyalty vs betrayal, authority vs subversion, and sanctity vs degradation. \n\nGiven that atheists are [highly skewed towards a progressive orientation](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-social-and-political-views/) from which consideration for sanctity, authority, and in-group loyalty are significantly less weighted, how can we construct a stable society in consideration of all individuals? In other words, if these instincts evolved to help form stable societies from a diverse group of people (in terms of cognitive ability and temperament), why would an ideology that appeals to a much thinner slice of humanity work even better?\nedit- Thanks /u/Kwinnox- added the fairness dimension",

When I'm busy, I'm always either happy or at least not sad. It only really hits me when I'm bored. I don't know if this is an early stage/sign of depression, but I want to do what I can if they could grow worse. I love the people around me so much, and I feel fulfilled when I'm with them.

Its as simple as that.\"\n\nThe Truman Show is IMO the best metaphor of what the religious experience is. In the film the protagonist, Truman, lives in a totally artificial world which is just a big film set made to film his life from birth to death as a tv show. Its the ultimate illusion and Truman having grown up there his entire life and not having experienced anything other than the film set believes it to be the reality. Eventually various events occur throughout the film which ultimately shock him into doubting his perception of reality and ultimately he arrives at the truth --&gt; that his \"reality\" is actually an illusion, the real world lies beyond. \n\nPerhaps Atheism is the same way? Perhaps Atheists have, like Truman pre-enlightenment, simply accepted the illusion of the world with which they have been presented with. Perhaps religious people, like Truman post enlightenment, have come to see the world for what it really is - an illusion. The reality being the sacred/divine? \n\nThis thought poses for us a question: how can we actually know the reality of our world? We've looked further into the universe than any human being has before us and haven't seen God or a mysterious door like in The Truman Show. All we see is more universe. \n\nBut what if thats the way its meant to be, perhaps we're not meant to literally observe God or whats beyond the universe in our lifetimes. In the Truman Show there are many events which act as signs leading Truman to ultimately come to the belief that his world is an illusion, that the reality is whats beyond. Likewise what if this world is the same way? In our world, the signs being things like; the sun and the moon, night and day, the stars, male and female, love, language, the variety of human races etc; which all ultimately, point to the reality of the divine? \n\nIn The Truman Show, a series of very strange events act as signs pointing to a reality beyond Truman's world. Perhaps all around us are signs which point ultimately to a divine reality beyond ours.  ",

        "text": "I’m a medical student and recently I had a meeting with my mentor as part of my honors in research program.  We’ve been working together for a few months and I went by to give an update on and get advice on my project and a future one.  We had to wait on someone else to drop off a hard copy of some data for us so I tried to make conversation in order to make myself more memorable.  I should note that he works in the field I’m interested in and is very high up the chain at this large hospital.  \n\nWe talk about things that are relevant to my studies, the career as a whole, and so on.  I noted during a lull in the conversation that I enjoyed this research because it gave me something worthwhile to do to improve myself.  He takes this as an opportunity to hand me one of a few Books of Mormon sitting on his desk.  He gives me a brief spiel about it and was tactful and not pushy at all.  I act politely interested with a few “oh wows” and “Oh, I didn’t know that”.\n\nI’d already known that he is mormon because I saw the books on his desk previously. I’ve also snooped on his LinkedIn page and noticed that he used to be a bishop for the church.  I’m not the least bit offended by him politely giving me a book that I might (in his opinion) be interested in.  \n\nI think he has more tact than this, but I’m slightly worried about the small chance that he brings it up again at a later date to ask what I thought of the book.  I want to preserve our relationship as best as possible and make it so that I can ask for a good letter of recommendation during my 4th year.   I’m an atheist but it really doesn’t matter to me what other people believe so long as it doesn’t impact our professional or personal relationship.  How should I handle a potential conversation regarding my thoughts on the book?  I really doubt that even if I get time to read it that the book will change my position in anyway and I don’t want to belittle his beliefs.\n\nI’m probably worried about nothing but I just saw this as a potential break down in one of the most important professional contacts for my med school years. \n\nedit: I used a throwaway in case people recognize me on my main account.  That way this can't be traced back to find out who he is, not that he wouldn't recognize himself.",

I chose to follow the belief that I found easiest to believe. \n\nThe question I have is this, why does it matter to me if someone else believes in a \"God?\" Does their belief somehow negate mine? I hesitate to self identify with atheists because rather than \"I don't believe,\" it seems as if many choose to tell others what they should believe. This seems weird to me. If you reserve the right to not subscribe to a belief, why don't some atheists recognize others right to the same? What justification do those who attack others beliefs use for themselves?

I enjoy having perspectives that I hadn't realized presented to me. While I still don't get behind antitheism, I do understand a bit better that the separation of beliefs is logically something that cannot happen because our actions based on those beliefs shape our world for each other whether we mean ill or not.

        "text": "This is a popular theory for the universe in the East. I often see eastern philosophy talked down upon on this subreddit, though never understood why. Taoism in particular can hardly be called a religion; more of just a way of life. Taoists believe in living with harmony in the present moment, because the present is all there is. And in a way, they're actually right! Scientific evidence backs this up, as we already know that time itself is a mere illusion of our perception, and doesn't really exist outside of that. So they say that the present moment is eternity, endlessly engulfing the universe in its wide variety of forms, and we are apart of that process.\n\n\nI see Alan Watts get quoted here often as well, which is strange because he is far from atheistic. He was my actual introduction into the *advaita Vedanta* philosophy in Hinduism. And of course, Hinduism is taking a leap of faith in believing there are ascended Gods and what not. Just like Christianity, I think it was intended as metaphors and the literalization has caused it to grow out of control. \n\n\nBut Advaita Vedanta is Nonduality. It is the belief that nothing is separate at all, and any perceived difference has an implicit unity. We do not know hot unless in relation to cold. We don't know black in relation to white, or up in relation to down. This is because it is one process, and one cannot exist without the other. The theory of relativity even backs this up: how do we know a planet is in motion unless in relation to other objects in space? And when you dissect an object to its base particles, you see that if you isolate one particle, it has no properties unless in relation to others. So even here in the rational West, we are discovering an underlying unity to the Universe.\n\n\nIf you're still not with me, then I will quote /u/DevinD420 for his/her explanation of Nonduality is better than I could've done:\n\n\n&gt;\"This theory is actually not new. It is the message of all religion. All scriptures describe this in their own ways. \n\n&gt;You are awareness. Consciousness. That consciousness is all that truly exists. \n\n&gt;Think of it as a television screen. Imagine this screen has no boundaries, stretching out infintely. No borders or edges. Imagine this screen has the quality of being aware. Since it has this quality of being aware, the screen is aware of itself. But it is blank.\n\n&gt;Now imagine a movie is projected on the aware screen. This movie is what we would call life in the body. All of the objects appear on the screen, and the screen appears lost in them. But there is only a screen. \n\n&gt;We see the body and we believe it is aware; but it isn't. There is no body; there is only a projection on the screen. All the projections on the screen are merely just infinite projections of its own self. This aware screen never comes into contact with anything but itself. It can't step away from or toward itself. While being perfectly still, it is everywhere at once; because there is no everywhere. There is only a projection on the screen of awareness. It is infinitely present through all of time; because there is no time. There is only the present moment, projected on the screen. A moment of time has never passed in all of eternity. \n\n&gt;So I will close with this. Nothing you see or know is aware. The human body isn't aware, animals aren't aware, the world isn't aware. Only awareness is aware. All of these objects are merely projections of awareness. It wants to trick itself; to know something \"other\" than itself. But there is nothing else. There is only pure awareness, and its infinite projections of its own self. Ever shape-shifting, while remaining totally formless.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts, r/TrueAtheism? I'd love to exercise true skepticism and have insightful discussions with you all. ",

When i was younger the reason i didn't like going to church was that i found it boring and uninteresting and just unenjoyable.\nIts not like I'm proud to be atheist i really would like to believe in being saved and living eternally after death but at the same time i just cant believe the idea of a god. \n\nBut basically I've been hating church for as long as I remember and now that I am making my own decisions about church I'm questioning if its really my own thoughts or if its the hate I had against my dad that drove me to also hate religion.\n\nI don't think there is a definite answer on this one but any ideas and opinions would help. Also don't worry about reassuring that being gay is ok thats what friends are for :P\n\nEDIT: Okay thank you guys for the responses it really helps, I'm also going to look for other ideas from people who are religious because I'm gonna take ideas from other biases. I was looking for opinions and I'm trying to figure this out because religion is a lifelong commitment i feel.",

While I am feel  quite comfortable in stating that the existence of a classical God (as much as it is a testable hypothesis) has no evidence, I am quite agnostic about any external source to the universe...like a higher dimensional scientist if you will.\n\nAfter all, there is not much difference between the [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) and a scientist-creator to the universe. And logic dictates that in the former, there is a high probability that we are in a simulation. \n\nAlso, out knowledge of physics breaks down in the earliest moments of the universe and we have no idea how the universe came in being exactly - we only know that it started expanding rapidly at some point of time. So it seems there is no scientific way to tell if the universe was actually created by something external. \n\n\nI would love to know where your atheism extends to, and if you believe there is anything to suggest that there is no external cause to the universe.\n\n\n\n",

My strategy was to get him to think about something else which shouldn't be too hard for a 5 year old.

I went to his room, asked him what was wrong and he told me, among other things, he doesn't want to go to heaven. Only this time he's crying and obviously upset about the subject. Though I'm not sure I'd guess that he's more afraid of dying than heaven. But both are unknowns to him and equally scary I suppose. I am out of my element here. My Wife and I are both newish atheists, however, the rest of our family is (very) Christian. Though we have never brought up the topic of dying or heaven I'm sure the grandparents have brought it up and this is what put it in his head. I don't mind my son having exposure to Christianity since there really is no getting around it here in the South (US). But I don't know what to tell him. Of course I don't believe in such a place but I don't think I could tell him there is no heaven and when you die it's over. I get the feeling that my son is a bit of a thinker I think it may stress him out more. My Wife and I are debating on just reassuring him that heaven is a great place and all that blah blah blah. But I don't know if this is healthy since we don't practice any religion and don't believe it.

Personally, I still don't know. I like to ask theists what they mean by God, to define it and tell me how they've constructed that definition. So far, I have yet to hear of a coherent, rational definition that wasn't self-contradictory. \n\nI just want to popularize this word because a lot of people still haven't heard about it - and it brings so much more discussion to the table than agnosticism - which is a position we all hold in the absence of evidence. Ignosticism is a position we all should hold in the context of gods because they almost always are ill-defined. \n\nI usually start any religious discussion with the idea that I'm ignostic. Then I say that of the gods talked about in various books - I'm a gnostic atheist - I know they don't exist. I also know they were invented in those books, and I know that the only way to believe that they are really out there is through faith - an unreliable epistemology. \n\nWhen we lack a good definition of what a god is, and gods are only said to exist when people believe they do - we come to one core definition of a God - having at least one believer. Thus, if you believe in yourself, you can become an autotheist (self god). You can define God however you want as long as you share the belief that you are that God. If theists are allowed to do these semantics, we should be allowed to do them too. \n\nSome of these ideas I got from an amazing album by The Faceless. Strongly recommend a listen. https://youtu.be/kVqE_vjWtiQ\n\nEDIT: To generate more discussion, do you find it's useful to tell a theist that you're ignostic, or just stick to general atheism/ agnosticism?\n",

Did you feel that these were at odds with the characteristics would you use to describe yourself?  I'm thinking people are far more inclined to leave a religion if they have little in common with its other practitioners from the start, because they never cared about being part of the ingroup and are even eager to distance themselves from it (see: militants atheism).  Conversely, people who enjoy being part of that group but have stopped believing in the religious scripture would probably be less likely to declare themselves atheists, for fear of being excluded.",

Safe so say that my major network of friends and family is mostly if not exclusively religious. My parents are divorced, fyi. My father is an atheist yet he barely ever talks. And my mom is a Christian, albeit, she's the passive type who hates to argue. I know I'm probably sounding selfish as I could have it worse, but I think I'm acting like the taboo Christian parent who just can't \"accept\" their daughter's atheism. While here I am feeling I can't \"accept\" my mom's Christianity. It's like my eyes have been opened and the only one here to celebrate with me in real life is myself. It's like i went through all the work to be brave and scared during my deconversion, but now it's like I'm on the other side of the battlefield trying to convince my mom it's not so scary over here and that I'm not crazy. However, my frustration easily gobbles up my patience. I wish I knew exactly why. A part of me feels awful about confronting her about it, but I constantly see myself in the eyes of a Christian. I see everything I used to think about the kind of girl I am. And then that gets me even more angry when I start to assume my mom views me in those offensive terms when she keeps saying she doesn't. It's a vicious cycle. And this is probably strengthening her faith, because I'm acting like a \"typically angry\" atheist sometimes. \nSomething inside me really hurts and gets scared because I hate to be isolated from my mother. Even if it's something as \"trivial\" as a worldview. But that matters to me. However, my fear and hurt gets translated into anger and therefore makes me seem like a raving atheist who \"hates God\" rather than doesn't believe in him. I'm passionate for truth, not for disillusionment... ",

Any time a person is convinced of the invalidity of theological arguments they have \"lost faith\" they don't \"fail to meet a burden of proof for their faith.\" Because faith is not about proof.\n\nSo it is through this definition of faith that I understand that respecting faith cannot help but be the most morally relativistic position one can hold. Because anyone can have faith about anything, and no faith can be disproved. If I have faith that god ought to be followed and wants everyone to love each other, then that belief happens to have nice consequences, but it is not based on sound argumentation, which means it can be dismissed, unless you have respect for faith. But if I have faith that god ought to be followed and wants everyone to punch eachother in the face all the time, then that belief has disastrous consiquences, but it is not based on sound argumentation which means it can be dismissed, unless you have respect for faith.\n\nSo any position that demands a respect for faith is morally relativistic because anything can be justified using faith because faith requires no evidence or argumentation to obtain and requires no evidence or argumentation to destroy.",

But the thing that always mind boggled me when I was a Catholic and even now as an agnostic is the afterlife (or as I like to call it the after party). I never understood what we where suppost to do up there? Like are there are good books to read or movies to watch? It sounds too farfetched but the reason why I still consider an afterlife a possibility is because of NDEs (near death experiences) and the fact that their causes aren't fully known. I can understand that believing in an afterlife does make it easier to think about death. But trying to grasp the idea of nothing after death confuses me. My main question is how do current atheists/agnostics view the idea of death?  How are you able to comfort yourself knowing \"welp this is the end nothing left for me here\". I'm asking because I want to view both perspectives of an afterlife and no after life.",

        "text": "Over the past several years, my personal belief that there is no god has been increasing and I've been reading, watching videos and lurking on atheist subs and other sites in an effort to learn more about the subject. I was raised catholic and I'm pretty familiar with the major tenets of christian belief but until recently I haven't felt a need to become better able to express WHY I no longer buy in to the belief in a god. I don't often find myself in situations where the subject or religion comes up, but should I be drawn in to a conversation about it, I want to be able to say more than just, \"I'm not religious\" and walk away (although there are times when that's really the only sensible thing to do!). One of the most helpful things I've seen are the [Street Epistemology videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocP40a_UvRkUAPLD5ezLIQ) . \n\nSo fast forward to yesterday where my BF and I went to the Gay Pride Festival in Charlotte NC. Not surprisingly, there were quite a few bible thumpers in different locations there. Some were quietly holding the usual hate-filled signs and looking grumpy while others attempted to preach to the heathen-hecklers. Located at approximately the middle block of the festival near the food area were two \"preachers\" who were obviously identical twins, wearing identical suits taking turns bellowing out all manner of the usual diatribe. They made absolutely no eye contact with anyone and I overheard someone say they looked like animatrons which was a perfect description. BF jokingly suggested that I try out my debating skills with one of them one on one just for giggles. After some back and forth with him on it, I decided to do just that. I felt the need to \"practice\" a conversation with one of these people.\n\nJust as Mr. Magnabosco does in his videos, I decided to just ask questions and see where things went. It was an interesting experience. I began by introducing myself and offered my hand, which he refused to shake. Keep in mind, I'm in my 50s and I was dressed as a regular guy; nothing garish, glittered or otherwise unconventional. I also don't recall him giving me his name either. I started by asking if they were from the Charlotte area and if they visit this festival every year. He said that it was their first time there and that they were from some church in Maiden NC, which was about an hour away. So I then asked what he hoped to accomplish by being there and he told me he was once a drinker/partier and fell into despair but was later SAVED! etc. I then asked if drinking was always a sin, since it was used in catholic rituals as a part of their worship. He replied with some bible verse that ended with something about the snake being at the bottom of the wine glass (hadn't heard that one before).\n\nI decided to let him know that I was once a catholic and that I definitely had some problems with some of their specific beliefs and he took the bait to go on a minor rant about them, even mentioning that someone joined his church and was \"saved from catholicism\",  which gave me a chuckle. We touched on several areas in the 5 or 10 minute chat. He told me that he found the creation story \"much easier to believe\" than the \"story\" of evolution so I asked him if he disregarded evolution merely because it was \"complicated\". \"Wouldn't you rather want to know that which was actually correct, even if it seems harder to understand?\". He gave me the usual line about \"it's in here (holds up bible), therefore it IS true\" etc. \n\nI asked how he knew that THAT version of the bible was correct, given the number of translations revisions etc. going back over the centuries. How would the KJV be better than, say the Greek bible from which it was apparently translated. Or why is KJV better than one of the more modern translations that were written in modern vernacular that people could actually understand. He danced a bit about the Greek version but insisted that the NIV version had \"changes\" and was therefore inaccurate. It was devoid of any reference to homosexuality, for example. And so on, and so on...\n\nI was becoming a tad bored with all this after a short while so I left it that we'd have to agree to disagree. Again (mostly out of habit) I offered my hand and he again refused to shake. He apologized and cited \"germs\" but said that there was no disrespect intended. OK, fine, whatever. I actually kind of enjoyed the experience though. This was the first time I'd really engaged a \"believer\" and by simply questioning it kept the pressure on him to try to persuade me and allowed me to see of I had enough knowledge to refute or at least question his claims. One thing that struck me was how he completely lost the \"animatronic\" persona when he realized that I wished only to have a civil conversation with him. He didn't come across as the nut job screaming at the top of his lungs that I saw minutes earlier. One might get the impression that in a quiet, respectful setting he could almost be reasoned with LOL.\n\nAnyway, that was my experience. I'd love to see stories from others here about interesting conversations with believers. ",

It never occurred to me that people believe in this stuff. For the longest time I thought that Noah's ark and Adam and Eve were fake. They first time I realized that people really cared about was when my grandma told me that I would go to hell for not praying before bed. Sometime later me parents told I would not get into heaven with them. So I decided to read my children's bible every night. It lasted a couple of pages. Then my parents started taking me to CCD class. It is a class were we learned about god and go through the steps of confirmation. Every week we would have homework to do. Out of the nine years of doing this I only did homework for two years. Only because they threatened to hold me back, and my parents told me that they would make me does this told I do confession, communion and confirmation. I actually hated my communion. It was long boring and now and decade later I still have a bunch of angel statues, crosses and bibles. That me parents freaked out over when I wanted to give them away. Mostly that bibles, what else can a kid do with six bibles. Later to be confirmed I was supposed to volunteer for mass, but I never did. Still passed somehow. I have not come out mostly because family and friends. I had second uncle that came out atheist and it made my mother cry and not a good cry. My father gave me a lecture and hopes that I find religion. I sure that they have somewhat a clue but it is not talked about. I have a step uncle who is a atheist and his mother talks about him behind his back. Then I have friends who tell me that I am not a real Christian because I play with a Ouija board ( which summons demons), go to church on Sundays and not Wednesdays like them, and when I was a first grader who did not know a Jesus fish was. So I probably\nwill when I move out permanently in three years.",

According to the usual thinking in the Muslim/Christian/Jewish world, he is omniscient, which means he knows everything. So let's suppose for the sake of this argument too that God is omniscient.\n\nAnd now let's talk about algorithms: algorithm is a plan of a way of acting, for a computer/machine/human/whatever, according to input of some type (legal input).\n\nGod knows everything, so he also knows about every algorithm Q and every legal input for it x, whether Q would eventually halt - finish its working - some time after it had started working according to that input, even after 6000000000000000 years or much more, or Q would never halt and continue working according to input x forever.\n\nAnd now, let's A be an algorithm that accepts as a legal input some algorithm - no matter what algorithm - P, that its legal input is also any algorithm, and works like that:\n\n1. if God knows that P eventually halts after it gets as an input itself (which is possible, since all the algorithms are its legal inputs, itself included), then A moves to an infinite loop like this:\n1.1. go to line 1.1 (current line).\n\n2. else - God knows that P never halts after it gets itself as an input - A simply stops working. Which means - A halts.\n\nHeed that even though we humans cannot - at least today - communicate with God and ask him to answer every time we put algorithm A to run on some input algorithm if that input would halt while working on itself, this algorithm is still legal and it exists in abstract sense, since we supposed God exists and knows everything.\n\nAnd now to this post's main milestone: God knows everything, so he also knows if A eventually halts after it gets itself as an input. A is an algorithm, and therefore a legal input to itself.\n\nIf God knows that A would halt on itself as an input, then A, after getting itself as an input and asking God if it'd halt on itself, would sent itself to the infinite loop in line 1.1 forever and so will never halt. A contradiction!\n\nIf God knows that A would never halt but continue running on itself forever, than A will stop running in line 2 and halt - a contradiction, again!!!\n\nSo anyway, there is a contradiction. A is a totally legal algorithm, so the source of the contradiction is that we supposed that God knows everything. Even more, it's actually that we supposed that some omniscient entity exists at all!\n\nThe conclusion is that no knowing-all creature exists,and that even if God indeed exists, there must be things he doesn't know. But then, he's different from how he's perceived by Islam, Christianity and Judaism.",
