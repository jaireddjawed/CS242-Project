There's a high cost associated with keeping software up to date and the additional costs of keeping documentation up to date is also another factor.\n\nAs someone who doesn't program much who went into software engineering purely out of interest because I enjoyed coding from a few classes here and there, I've found UML diagrams to be essential to understanding and breaking down projects. It helps me get past the \"paralysis\" and gives me a proper structure to approaching problem solving. \n\nSo I ask - is UML really that much of an outdated tool?",

I can only get sales/ sales-related jobs (such as IT recruitment). I am working in IT recruitment now, and I see that there are a lot of job opportunities, and that IT professionals get paid better than probably 90% of the people I work with. \n\nI've always been smart enough to major in something like chemical or software or electrical engineering (or to go to law school, and if I had the course work, even med school). Point is, I know it will be hard work and that it's not for everybody etc.\n\nI am just curious how long it would take to say make lead developer, then move into an IT manager role, as ideally, I would move up into management after some time doing strictly development work. \n\nThanks everyone, and sorry if there are already posts like this, but I didn't see one in the side bar. \n\n",

Something like: Programming language, Operating system etc.\n\n\n&gt;Just a few questions to make me sound like I know what I am on about and to get an overall picture of what he does so I can match him easier to jobs I receive. \n\n\n&gt;Thank you for your time. \n\n\nGH",

At my current shop, they give us a requirements doc that lays out the basic flow of the app, has some use case diagrams in it and gives a general overview of the data flow, like what data needs to be entered into the app to produce the reports, any major calculations that need to be included, etc.\n\nMy usual process at this point is to read the docs 3-4 times until I understand them, draw some stuff on my white board, fire off questions to the PM, rinse and repeat untill I can put together a complete database diagram, some logic charts and build a UI prototype.\n\nI have a couple other coders in the shop but they dont seem to do much more than that either.  My rpocess works but it seems to take a long time so I was hoping to get some tips and ideas from a couple seasoned folks.",
