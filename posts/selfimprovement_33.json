I'm 26 years old now. Almost 27.\n\nThe paradox is that deep down I feel capable of achieving great things in life. But time is also a factor. People keep telling me to hurry up and do something now because it will be harder later in life. They, of course, are right. This, in turn, keeps making me feel like I'm missing out on opportunities and thus giving me a \"too late\" sensation.",

I don’t have a bad word to say about her, she has never done anything wrong but I’m starting to feel so crap now. Everyone I like prefers her and chooses her over me and I’m just so deflated \n\nI was talking to a guy from a dating app for a few weeks, then bumped into him on a night out with her. He ghosted me the next day and slid into her dms and said ‘you’re much more my type’ and tried to chat to her. She didn’t respond and told me and it wasn’t a big deal at all \n\nThen my closest friend (A) who I hung out w all the time started distancing from me and now they’re ‘the’ best friends. I’ve been completely replaced in my A’s life with this friend and me and A haven’t talked in months now.  \n\nThen a guy at work I thought was kinda cute came on a night out with us. We chatted lots and then the next day I found out they hooked up and as far as I’m aware they’re dating now \n\nAnd now today the guy I actually really fancy but !!! doesn’t know I exist!!! has asked her out after meeting her yesterday and she’s considering saying yes (as her and the prev guy are v casual and new) \n\nLike I said she hasn’t done anything wrong so I am not mad w her or anything at all but it just seems that everyone in my life prefers her and I just feel so inadequate and sad and my confidence is at an all time low and I’m just sad now :( Idk how to not compare myself to her, I used to be so confident and sure of myself but I now hate everything I say because I can’t stop thinking about how who I am clearly isn’t good enough so I should just shut up and be more like her\n\nHow do I find my confidence again? I used to be the happiest most positive energy and now I hate the words that come out of my mouth bc I’ll just embarrass myself",

This is where people are unaware. \n\nWe believe that freedom and prosperity comes from self-control. Not realizing you already have control over YOURSELF (as how are you supposed to \"control yourself\" if you don't already control yourself?), but that you are rather trying to control a part of your mind that is designed to inform and open your consciousness.\n\nThat's the problem, we are neither meant to accept or deny our thoughts and emotions, because their purpose is to inform us, not command us. Ignoring unhealthy thoughts and emotions will provide short-term benefits but long term problems.\n\nAs you are cutting off the plants but not the roots in which they grow from, causing them to consistently to reappear. That's where acknowledgment comes in, we got to acknowledge our inner desires and beliefs even if they seem stupid. \n\nWe are meant to work with our thoughts and feelings and acknowledge their purpose and root causes. That's how you achieve more awareness which leads to more true freedom. \n\nSociety at large seems to have fallen victim to the belief that discipline is essentially about suppressing our very ignorant desires and beliefs. \n\nIts not about \"self-control\" or \"self-freedom\" but SELF-UNITY in which you and your unconscious work together rather than both of your desires being separate. Our cognitive abilities are greatly enhanced once we work with our unconscious rather than live separate from it.",

Maybe it's more about laughing at the surprise that they pop a topic just like this.\n* People make fun of me, like \"your hair looks like a dust mob today\" and I laugh. But I don't want to. If they make fun of me, they can laugh but have to endure that I don't laugh with them. I know, having a sense of humor is good, but some jokes are just hurtful and I don't want to laugh at them.

        "text": "I am a person who does whatever they set their mind to and achieves what I want through hard work and determination. This helps me in getting better in almost everything and improving exponentially in that specific field. For example, if I wanna learn a programming language, I pick it up and make like 3-4 projects on it within a week. Recently I got into chess and good very good at it and also better than the people who introduced me to chess in the first place.  \n\n\nBut there's a problem with that:  \n\n\nYou see, all this sounds great, but the problem is that the secret to me improving so quick is I get SUPER OBSESSIVE over these things. When I played chess, I used to average like 7-8 hrs per day. When I programmed in a new language, I used to program until my back ached and even stayed up a couple of days, obsessively improving my projects even though there was no deadline or anything on me regarding those projects.   \n\n\nAnd then I just suddenly stop. I stop working on the language when I think I'm good enough and for example stop playing much chess when I think I'm good enough. As soon as I pass the threshold of skill I've made for myself, I start losing interest and reduce how much I work on that particular thing.  \n\n\nSo my question is, is this bad for me? I feel like I waste my time because of this but I also dont want to lose this 'skill' as it helps me improve very quickly. Is there any way I might improve this obsession and make it more consistent?  \n\n\nTL:DR: I try new thing, get obsessed with it. Become very good at it. Lose interest in said thing and stop doing the thing.",

I teeter on the feeling of excitement and anxiety, and when it's anxiety, it's so bad I can feel nausea or like crying. Despite it all, I still feel like it's a decision I need to go through with. That being said, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't second guessing my whole decision just a tiny bit. I have a place lined up, I have $55k saved up, no job lined up but I'm in the fine dining industry and have 10 places listed that I'm going to apply to the day I arrive. \n\nI'm also leaving the girl I've been seeing, which has been so fucking hard. She's been incredibly understanding but it's killing me to see how much pain it is causing her. Here's the thing though, she's nearly twice my age, and while we get along soooo great on an emotional level, there are just some things that the age gap makes too difficult - our physical capabilities, our future plans, etc. So I know even if I stayed, it would be a relationship that would have to come to an end eventually.\n\nHas anybody been in a similar situation? Is it normal to feel this anxious? I could really use some advice",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nI’m 25 years old in a few days. I’ve been abusing weed for more than a year now, on and off between binge smoking and quitting for a few days, or weeks before going back. \n\nI got my medical license and I’ve been smoking everyday for about 2 weeks now again or so. I had to get my license because I had a drug test coming up for probation, it was either that or fail. \n\nI binge smoke and lose interest in all else I’m doing until I’m just getting high all the day and I start to feel down in the dumps until eventually I decide to quit and the cycle repeats itself. \n\nThere are problems in my life that lead to my addictive tendencies and unless I can consistently work on that I will continue down the same path. \n\nFor some context: I’m almost 25 and I live alone, with my cats. I have a house, a car, internet, food, everything I need without working or paying out of my own pocket. I have mental problems and thankful to have a mother that has made life manageable for me. \n\nDue to a lack of responsibility, I struggle greatly with managing addictions. \n\nRight now, I started exercising in the gym again and also at the park, so I could get some sun I hadn’t seen for weeks, that made me feel better. Just doing things like showering or brushing my teeth, staying clean and eating to start things off is what I’m focused on day 1. \n\nThe problem is I start feeling good in a few days and start smoking again because I get bored eventually or my brain will have an internal battle where I ultimately decide what is the point of living if I can’t enjoy myself? And I smoke. Which causes me to fall back into the addiction and I stop taking care of myself again \n\nI want to be able to enjoy weed sometimes, and not have it become the most important thing in my life until I crash. \n\nI think for this, I need not just balance but a purpose, an important drive or responsibility that keeps me grounded instead of closing myself up in my own little world with weed. \n\nI started training in MMA along with exercising, it’s doing good for me and giving me competitive drive. I stopped going during my last binge however, but I plan to start again today. \n\nI think that eventually also getting a girlfriend, aka a fulfilling rship, along with maintaining good habits, and doing something competitive will make me feel more content and satisfied, and my desire to smoke weed can become a once in a while enjoyment. \n\nThoughts?\n\nMy problem just tends to be that, I always “hone in” on a particular hobby/interest and it causes me to drop everything else. I have adhd \n\nAlso, I’ve worked many different fields of work in the past. I get fired eventually or quit. I lose interest in what I do and yeah. \n\nI don’t fit very well into society. I don’t want to either. I just want to live life in a way that makes me feel good about myself and who I am. \n\nI want to compete in mma as a career. I don’t know if this new sense of purpose will stick, or if I’m chasing a new goal. \n\nEven if I change my mind on that, I want to continue training. As well as exercising, and my daily habits. So I can become more grounded and balanced throughout my day to day life. I want to also be able to smoke and enjoy weed sometimes, without it dragging me down for a binge. \n\nThere are 3 paths I see presented for me:\n\n- Put all my energy and effort into training MMA, to make it a career and achieve greatness. Knowing full well that my efforts may be in vain. \n\n- Succumb to my addictive tendencies and struggle with the same problems all my life, never ending up doing much. \n\n- Develop a balanced life I can somehow enjoy living every day. \n\nMy head is scrambled eggs at the moment so I apologize for the long post. \n\nJust want some advice",

It’s just a case of finding the opportunity where it’s not forced and I can wave my hands around a bit. It’s strange, having gone through this experience for a bit now, I feel the same tension beforehand that I always do but it’s not quite as intimidating. It feels closer to excitement than anxiety.\n\nAnother thought that. I’ve got rn is that my mindset is slowly evolving from the ‘I have to’ to an ‘I get to’ which makes it a much more enjoyable experience.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nSo I went and bought something and really focused on taking up as much space as possible. The effect was I was a lot more confident continuing the conversation , my posture naturally improved and the conversation flowed nicely.\n\n**Thoughts:** \n\nTurns out gesticulating/taking up room is really potent with me. Defintely something I’m going to use more of in future.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "Although this is mainly something that seems to be a recurring online too many people fall for it, and this IS online so why not tell people how to get over it. \n\nA while ago I knew a guy who trained everyday to the point where he would look Arnold without roids. It was insane, girls would love him and his body was simply sculpted like in an old superhero movie. He would often post on Instagram though, and this was where it went wrong. Some of his posts would receive hundreds of likes, and he would get very happy because of this. \n\nFor some reason though there will always be a person trying to ruin things for others. Comments like \"must be the roids😂\" or \"looking kinda skinny bro\" would get into his head. He'd argue with the men commenting which I already told him not to do since he wouldn't gain anything from such activities, and would only get triggered more and more because nobody wins an argument when overly aggrevated. \n\nListen to me, yes you. No matter how pretty you are, people on the internet will tell you you're ugly. No matter how buffed you are, people on the internet will tell you you're skinny. No matter how many books you read, to the internet it's not enough. Cause of this is that anybody can leave ANY comment on these sites, say anything and it'll all be equally credible because everyone is an expert on the internet. The internet removes the feeling of responsibility you have, it's kinda like those nuclear war simulators where although the damage you may be causing is unparalleled you're sheltered behind a screen so nobody can hurt you. Evil people take advantage of this and will try to ruin you. \n\nHere is some food for thought to get over this feeling of dependency/sensivitiy to the opinions of the internet:\n1. People here know as much as you do. Although grouping them together with posts with thousands or millions of likes may look impressive, I can assure you that all of these people are exactly that: people. There is nothing different about asking some random child on the street what he thinks of your fitness records in comparison to asking your typical Redditor.\n2. The internet has created a cancer with ratio's and like/dislike buttons. Platforms have turned into a race to become the most outstanding person in the community and people will do both good and bad to get this done.\n3. Improvement has become a shielding community for many wrongdoers in order to push ideologies that can simply be seen as propaganda, really. A good example of the latter is the entire masculinity over modernity BS. Yes, men used to die in war and we need a protecting force to survive, but how does that really have anything to do with the topic of improvement and what are these posts exactly trying to do other than make everyone involved feel bad? And isn't it suspicious how the antagonists of these posts are always the weak, the women, the nerds, the one's that ancient societies these masculinity communities adore actually wanted to protect since compassion is worth more than the primitive idea that \"we GO JIM\" means improving as a person? \n\nGot a bit off-topic there, but my point still stands. Don't feed yourself with everything that is on the internet because people on the internet don't care about your feelings.",

        "text": "I (25M) have been at this for a while. I have always been a hopeless romantic I always wanted to find someone special I can share my life and passions and vice versa. I did the typical things in college, asking girls on dates, doing activities hanging out, etc. Didn't really get me anywhere though, I always got ghosted, got told that they weren't ready for a relationship only for that same girl to get into a relationship a few weeks later, got told I was cool but I was better off being a friend, etc. Then I started working out... a lot. I gained a ton of muscle and grew a beard and changed my hairstyle and clothes. I thought that would help and truth be told it did a little bit but I was still running the same problems. My roommate at the time (I currently live with him now) then told me that I have to start treating women badly to an extent if I wanted to keep their attention. He's really into the red pill scene and would share the content with me he would tell me that women like toxic men who gaslight and manipulate them and mess with their heads, give them drama and excitement, the whole nine yards. I was appalled at first and resisted but eventually, my loneliness got the better of me and I gave the red pill tactics a shot. I was an actor in high school and really got into the role of playing the part of a toxic fuck boy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hated every minute of it, but at the end of the day.....it worked. I got laid a lot and I would have girls actively perusing me and even the girls that friend-zoned and ghosted came back to me. I would have random women I would meet at parties hit me up for booty calls. It was like a drug, I felt powerful. I would just continue to play my part as the toxic guy and talk down to women and treat them like badly. I still feel extremely remorseful today but I thought I was just giving women what they wanted. It made me sad, but I was committed to staying to the bit. I really feel bad about it now. I started having an identity crisis (still am to large extent) because I've been told my whole life that to find a relationship I'd just have to be myself, work on my life and find someone who matches my energy. But now those women didn't love me. They loved a character I was playing and that made me super depressed because my true self wasn't enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter graduating college I decided to drop the act and be myself again I learned a thing or two from my days in college but then I began to run into the same issues again and I relapsed into the red pill again. It started getting into my head that I could treat women as badly as I wanted as long as I had the looks to back it up. This is horrifying to me now that I genuinely thought like this. I downloaded tinder in my city and pulled all the same tactics and well... I was very successful. But I still hated every moment of it but I would always justify to myself \"this is what women want I'm giving them what they want.\" I don't know what snapped me out of it but I think it was the fact that I saw this persona I was playing taking over who I was in reality. I think my sister called me out on bullshit over the holiday and I realized that I'm becoming a monster. I want to be myself again. I want to be me again, the shy nerdy guy who likes museums, the outdoors, history, politics, books, Sci/Fi, and fantasy. But in the past, that was never enough. I want to deprogram whatever is in my head. Yes, I found a therapist and am starting next week and I got off of the red pill content I was subscribed to. Currently dropping out of dating until I get my shit together. Judge me if you want I probably deserve it. I'm just sick of being someone I'm not.",

Schabadoo Jr.\n\n&gt;⠀check check engine light\n\n&gt;⠀prepare for work thing\n\nAnd then to prioritize, I simply went through the list and picked like 2-3 things and did this:\n\n&gt;☐schedule appointment\n\n&gt;☐call place and give insurance\n\n&gt;⠀read book so-and-so mentioned\n\n&gt;⠀replace broken doohickey\n\n&gt;⠀tidy up this area\n\n&gt;⠀call back J. Schabadoo Jr.\n\n&gt;⠀check check engine light\n\n&gt;☐prepare for work thing\n\nThose are empty boxes that need to be checked off.  I focus only on the boxes until they're all checked.  Then I add more empty boxes.  I can also add new tasks and box them immediately if needed.\n\nThis helps to break down seemingly impossible workloads, you get the dopamine high of checking things off, you don't forget things since you just add them as you go, it's much easier to prioritize.  You can also visualize your progress and give yourself little pats on the back.\n\nMaybe this seems obvious, but the process of adding boxes to prioritize has been a game-changer for me.  I tried the Todoist app, but paper and pen is much more...satisfying?  Plus I got a blue pen to make boxes and a red pen to make the checkmarks.  Now that's sharp!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1124l9v/how_to_tell_if_youre_lovebombing_yourself_and/",
        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen and all NBs in between, I regret to inform you, we’re love bombing ourselves.\n\nYou’ve heard of this term, no doubt. Usually it’s used to describe a megalomaniac abusive partners. To make up for their shitty ways, they shower their “loved one” with gifts, or buy flowers, or take their significant other out to expensive dates. It often happens after a period of particular hateful behavior.\n\nThis type of abuse is sneaky. One might thing, “Well, s/he has his bad spells, but look how much loving I get when things are going well!” It’s hard to kick against the goads of human biology, and when you feel that rush of oxytocin and endorphin, you’re hooked. This technique by abusers is effective, but incredibly manipulative. It’s hard not to get stuck in these patterns and dragged down in a terrible relationship.\n\nSo what does this have to do with your relationship with yourself?\n\nEnter self-love.\n\nSelf-love is a significant concept that has been bastardized to the point that it’s barely recognizable.\n\nI used to think the term was just co-opted by bullshitters and insufferable douche bags.\n\nI’d see endless social media posts about “self-love.” A person would describe the spa days, indulgent high fat meals, or nights out drinking that they used to reward themselves. \n\nNothing is wrong with these things, implicitly. I love to imbibe or treat myself to an “unhealthy” reward from time to time. I believe it’s even a healthy practice. “Everything in moderation, including moderation — including moderation,” as Oscar Wilde would say.\n\nBut I noticed an even more concerning, insidious trend creeping up when I scrolled through all the self-love posts. Many of my same friends who touted “treating yourself” also posted cutthroat posts about cutting people off, maintaining a “small circle” and feelings of general paranoia. One such post, for instance, read “I’ll tell you a secret you’re not ready to hear. A lot of your friends are talking shit about you. A lot of them aren’t your friends at all.” There was no redeeming message, no advice as to how to mitigate such a damning and depressing truth. Just abject hopelessness.\n\nIn my opinion, friends, such posts do nothing to serve you. They brutalize your image of all of your relationships just for the sake of getting “likes” and “shares.” And while it’s true there are friends and families who you *do* need to be cut off…it’s just not true that you have no one in your corner. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen friends post these hopeless and self-protecting diatribes only to think, “How could Jane Doe feel this way? She has so many people, including myself, who adore her.”\n\nYour brain is a liar, sometimes. People care for you and like to see you succeed.\n\nIt was when I was reading one such post that a light bulb went off in my head.\n\nMany of us are perennially abusing ourselves, only to love bomb ourselves a week later. Have you seen this pattern of posts?\n\n-“Keep your circle small. There aren’t many you can trust anymore.”\n\n-“I’m at the point where I can only depend on myself. Don’t ask me for anything. I’ll take care of me and mine and fuck the rest.”\n\n-“I’m trying. I am. But if you hate me, the truth is I hate myself more.”\n\n-“Want to know a secret? I’ve never felt pretty. Not even once in my life.”\n\nAnd then those same posts will be followed by a refrain like this:\n\n-“There’s no ‘talking phase’ with me. Worship me or die.”\n\n-“The mission I’m on is personal. I owe myself a lot.”\n\n-“When you finally find that one person who you are supposed to be with. (Accompanied with an image of a person kissing their reflection in a mirror.”\n\nSometimes memes are shared in jest. I appreciate the occasional self-aggrandizing post, so don’t think I’m a prude.\n\nBut I’d encourage you (as I’ve encouraged myself,) to examine your mind if you notice a pattern.\n\nAre you truly practicing self-love, or are you trying to love-bomb yourself to tip the scales, hoping to balance out how much hatred you hold for yourself?\n\nWhen you share posts tacitly accusing your friends and family of being fakes who actually hate you—does that idea serve you in any way?\n\nWhen you’re going on lavish self-dates, are you celebrating yourself (as you should!) or are you hoping for some escapism—a brief respite from the hell you rain down on yourself on the daily?\n\nMy hope and wish for you, friends, is that you won’t do any spiritual bypassing for a temporary escape. I hope you do the hard work to heal, whether that comes from cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation, reconnecting with a spiritual or religious tradition, or simply self-reflection.\n\nYou *do* deserve self-love. \nIn my experience, there are no shortcuts.\n\nMay you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you be at ease.\n\nLove,\nHarlow",

The pros? I learnt a lot of stuff in a short while and kind of even developed a stronger love for learning. I knew things much better than many of my peers do. The cons? I got very little sleep, did not socialize at all, barely watched TV or read other books, occasionally feel really ill (fatigue), blah blah ... And still, I failed in the end. This left a really big scar, and I was so badly hurt that I couldn't even cry. It still is too painful. This is the first time I failed. \n\nThis year, I'm planning for something similar. My friends are encouraging me saying the harder I work, the more I'd understand, the easier things will get with time, etc. But the failure that happened last year is scaring me much, and I can't help but think I'll fail this time, too. \n\n\\*I'm learning this purely for fun, for joy. I can always quit or take a break and it won't affect my career or anything. I just want to learn because like I said, I'm loving it. Help me get over the fear of failure.",

I was so happy i made a close friend i loved everything about them.....and i wanted to be their friend for as long as i could. but i knew from the beginning that this friendship wasn't gonna last because of my metal health issues they just got worse and worse. sure i was happy at times but most of the time i was sad... empty....insecure...and confused. so i had to cut things off with almost all my friends, i just couldn't take it anymore i didn't want them to see the girl who can't even take care of herself........ the girl who doesn't even love herself.\n\ni couldn't get myself to let go of him. i said i was going to take a break but.... i lie so i just came clean to him about how i'm not going be to coming back. than we said our goodbyes....\n\ni thought it end there but after that i just couldn't stop thinking about him i'd even check to see if he was online from time to time, and wonder if he was okay. i had fell for him..... at first i was in denial about but it just became more clear to me but at the same time it frustrated me because how can i love someone when i can't even love myself. soo months flew by and yet he'd still cross my mind. my metal health was still bad but some issues got better. i hadn't fully letted go of him yet.......so i came back like the fool that i am.\n\ni logged back on to roblox and played games for a while hoping he texted me.......than he did i was so happy i cried from there we started talking again it was really nice seeing him talk about the things he likes. we started talking a lot again. than he ask me for my phone number i don't think i've ever texted yes so fast in my life.\n\nwe just got closer from there\n\nbut i couldn't stay... i knew that i just didn't want to accept it cause it hurt. i couldn't hide it anymore so finally i let him go..........it hurts so badly what hurts me the most is the fact i'll never see him again......\n\ni'm sorry for wasting your time for lying to u for pretending that our friendship would last, for leaving for making u feel bad. i know your upset with me and you have every right to be.\n\nty for reading",

No matter your living circumstance. \n\nJust think of how much extra time you would have!\n\nYes, hard things are hard, but if you are only doing hard things, and actually resting when your body needs it, those hard things get more fun and easier every day.\n\n“Hard” now becomes normal, and your brain actually changes to sustain this, and it feels amazing. \n\nThis is also how I look at monk mode, staying with that shifted mindset for however long you want the benefits.\n\nIf you are faced with a problem while creating, simply sit with your thoughts, observe how you are feeling, take a quick rest if you need (and by rest I mean meditate or do another chill activity like read. That’s NOT tiktok or reddit,  unless you actually are looking for useful information.) and then get back to it.\n\nYour brain will be trained this way over weeks and it will come so naturally to you, it’s almost supernatural.\n\nYour friends and family might try and drag you down and make fun because of this change on how you live your life for the first bit, but they won’t be making fun when they see the PROGRESS!!!\n\nYou got this.

I noticed that she now switched duties to roll carts (or buggies) back to where they needed to be in the parking lot. Coincidentally, she put some carts in to an area close to where I was parked, as I still had not pulled out. I believe she noticed that I was there, and as she walked away, she fixed her hair behind her ears. \n\nI then felt a rush of adrenaline and suddenly felt that I needed to smoothly roll up to her and ask for her number. This was since she was still not too far away, and I felt she knew I was still around. So, I rolled up, awkwardly passing forward through (only a few) parking spaces to where she was loading in some more carts… when then she was distracted by talking to a customer who passed by. I had already committed, and it would have been awkward to have stopped where she was and to have waited… so I decided to just leave. I felt so much adrenaline and was wired. She was beautiful, and I just thought she must’ve somewhat liked me.\n\nMy question is: would it be weird if I showed up in the next day or so to the market, just to see she is there or not? Thought I may just buy something cheap, and then hopefully get her number then. \nHow do I know if she liked me?

I don’t know if its a bad thing because we can go days without really talking but still are dating. This is my first girlfriend so I’m really not sure what is “correct” for a relationship but all of my friends/family that are dating always seem to be talking to their SO on their phones, but i am not.",

        "text": "Here’s the thing with me. I was a shy kid growing up due to a variety of reasons (parental upbringing, wasn’t exposed, insecurities). I felt like an outsider most of my life. \n\nAs a person who was more in the background, I got to observe things around me. I always felt like I had an accurate sense of other people’s emotions, and what they’re thinking/feeling. I spend time alone a lot. I think quietly, in my head. Some good did come out of my quietness though, as I consider myself to be more emotionally intelligent than most people I know. \n\nBut I lack so many skills and knowledge from having such a narrow intake as a kid and teen. I’m so boring because I don’t read, I haven’t watched many movies or TV, I am not active on social media, so I feel really out of touch with pop culture. \n\nI haven’t been diagnosed but I’ve had feelings of depression even as a kid, that’s another reason why I couldn’t get myself to branch out. \n\nI’m in university studying something that I don’t have much passion for. I want to learn new things and skills but I feel frozen. I have pending tasks to do for school so doing something else just feels wrong. \n\nI’ve been wasting so much time. My social media feed is not benefiting me in anyway. If I’m meeting a person, there is absolutely nothing interesting for me to say about myself. \n\nHas anyone felt this way? Tell me how you started to add more depth to yourself.",

I HATE IT. I like to know exactly what I have to do and when.\n-  not respecting any goal that I am setting - I’d always sabotage myself\n\nWhat I can do tho (but that from time to time, not always):\n\n- be productive in one day more than in 2 weeks\n\nWhat I need (in my opinion, but I am posting here exactly because I want ideas from you as well):\n\n- a busy schedule (I’d love to have it, but atm I am moving between countries &amp; I am looking for a job anywhere else just not in the country I am about to move for a short period)\n- find new hobbies (have time and money for them or it(1))\n- literally get out of my comfort zone\n\nHow do I do that?\nWhat do I lack of?\nIs there a guided plan? I LIKE FOLLOWING RULES (I love how I am contradicting myself cuz sometime I might sabotage myself, but other times not if the thing I’m following is awesome - I hope that makes sense…)\nIs there any sentence that I can say in my mind to keep myself motivated?",

        "text": "Hi, so I’m feeling lots of feelings right now, I feel really upset, lack of momentum, and I’m overwhelmed by the tasks I have on my hand, scared, and I couldn’t help but blame myself in my head. It’s affecting my ability to preform during work/studies. \n\nSo, I’m an artist, and I haven’t been drawing for a while because I’ve been disorganized.\nSomething that really upsets me is that my prompts, products are shitty and not ideal and I’m unhappy about it.\n\nI can’t help but to compare myself with other people. A small amount of comparison is healthy, humans need each other to be their mirror and value where they are at themselves. However, as for me, in this case it’s playing a negative part more than the positive one. I’m really fucking scared that I’ll stop drawing and give up the things I care for right now at the moment.\n\nAnother thing that I feel stressed for is the planning of goals. \n\nI feel bad for how I acted in social interactions today, and I keep overthinking about it. People were nice to me, and I’m unable to respond to them. I felt like shit for the most part today. At times, I only have the capacity to respond to close/good friends, as they understand me and I don’t need to worry about anything.\n\nAnyone experienced similar feelings? How did you go through this?",
