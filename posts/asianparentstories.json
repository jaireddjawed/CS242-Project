Yet it seems the world has been blinded by only the good things AP would do.

Multiple other family members were aware of the situation but didn\u2019t speak up. They just watched and ridiculed me. At one point an uncle realized it\u2019s going too far and informed my mother. Mind you up until that point that I was scared to death because I was getting death threats from the person abusing me should I try go leave or get out of line. My mother then proceeded to traumatize me, insult me and tell me it\u2019s all my fault. How I could do this to her. How I could bring so much shame to the family. I was alone. Scared go death every fucking day. Wanting to die everyday. No help from anybody.\n\nI got into years of therapy and now I know it was never my fault. I was a 13 year old child and got out of it as soon as I got the courage at 18.\n\nMy mother also tried to use me for my money. Wanted everything the second I started making money. So did my dad.\nAt one point I remember him saying he would go to the bank and just take it all. He is old and delusional. Not healthy in his head anymore due to his age (70+).\n\nMy mom lied to me, manipulated me, heavily controlled me. Absolutely no boundaries. No respect for me, my thoughts, feelings or opinions. They never mattered for once.\n\nI worked hard. Today I got an absolutely wonderful boyfriend she doesn\u2019t know of because she wouldn\u2019t approve (he is from a Christian background, nit religious though just like me and western nationality, basically from the country we live in, to my mom they are the foreigners though. Even though she is the one living in their country). And I don\u2019t have the capacity for the drama yet, so I kept it to myself so far.\n\nI got a beautiful 3 bedroom apartment at a wonderful location close to work. \n\nI give her gifts sometimes (home appliances usually) but she doesn\u2019t get a penny from me money-wise. I try to do my \u201edaughter duties\u201c. I still take my dad to trips where I have to pay for everything. They are too cheap to spend their own money. But I\u2019m still trying.\n\nThe thing is I\u2019ve grown so cold towards them. I used to cry about not having loving, emotionally mature, intelligent parents. I used to long for it. We don\u2019t have any deep talks, its all surface level and never ever anything important. They are mentally not capable of it.\nI am so traumatized that the moment she asks me where I\u2019m going I want to scream and yell. Because of they way she used to control me and not let me out (standing in front of the door, locking it).\n\nEven if she just kindly asks me for some groceries now when I\u2019m on my way to them I feel disgusted and used. Even though it\u2019s nothing bad at all.\n\nI don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t feel emotionally safe. I\u2019ve tried for years to talk to her, to build a bond. As soon as I feel like it might have worked, everything goes back to usual and I\u2019m left heart broken.\n\nThese are the boundaries I\u2019ve set:\n-When I visit them and they disrespect me, I get up and leave. I text her she has disrespected me again and I cannot let that happen. That I will be distancing myself for a few days and to please leave me alone and think about the things she\u2019s said.\n\n-If she keeps harrassing me via phone\/text she gets blocked. She usually sends me text messages asking who is brainwashing me like this and if she\u2019s never allowed to say anything anymore. It\u2019s always the same, she\u2019s a broken record.\nIf she calls me from my dad\u2019s phone, he gets blocked\n-I absolutely never ever tell her anything about my private life. She has never learned this country\u2019s language, never made any friends so she doesn\u2019t understand the culture and the way of life here. I was born here. We do not see eye to eye in most things because of this. Also she could be my grandmother. It\u2019s not just the cultural\/religious differences it\u2019s also her being much older than me.\n\nBtw me being abused was just swept under a rug. Never talked about.\n\nThe latest issue is she wants to go to her home country where I was abused. I went there for a few years after I was abused but luckily didn\u2019t meet the people who were involved in me being abused. At this time I absolutely refuse to. They want to portray the happy family picture in front of their own cousins and uncles and aunts. I don\u2019t want any part in this shit show. She\u2019s forcing me to go. She wanted me to go for a month like we used to as kids and doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m a working adult and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m throwing away all of my vacation days for her.\n\nI told her now we will not be in touch as long as she forces me to go there. I am incredibly grateful to have a safe space. She doesn\u2019t know my address. No way of her finding me if I don\u2019t want her to. Thank fucking god.\n\nI guess my question is how would you handle this situation? Anything you would have done differently? I try to be fair but my priority is my own safety always.

She texted this morning to ask if I'm free for 4 days in two week's time, with no information on whether dad is coming too, what they're planning to do in the area, where they're staying, etc. Then she calls, puts me on the speaker to talk with the aunts that I haven't spoken to in 9 years, plays all nice and chipper, and asks me to confirm our availability. When I ask her where she's staying and what she's planning to do, she says there are no definite plans (fishing for me to invite all of them to stay at our place). Since I didn't offer her, she asked me to let her know when they can do dinner at our place. Both my partner and I work full time, and our house is not set up to host 4 people comfortably.

Everytime I legit see them, my mood will always be ruined and I'd get pissed off everytime I see their face. Like what the fuck!?

My godmother was even tryna control my sorry-ass life as if I'm her \"little puppet\" and my godfather having to overcriticize me about my grades and then comparing me with other people who got into that College.\n\nBefore my hate for my godparents started to worsen, it all began when both my parents began to separate due to personal reasons I shall not reveal. I've stayed in their house for like almost about a year before I returned home, my godmother and godfather usually guilt-tripped, overcriticized, overpunished, smacked me hard before (Godmother ofc) and controlled every ASPECT of my life. Both of them taught my mom all of these stuff and at that moment of time, I didn't realise my mental health started to worsen. I thought I'm \"fine\" however, I am NOT fine at ALL. All these time I'm just a fucking puppet whom my godparents thought me as if I just have to work endlessly and then forego my gaming hobby and made me as if I am already their fucking lapdog. \n\nAfter I came to learn the dark truth about them, I then have to turn my back on them and then distance myself away from them. What's worse is that I haven't even fully recovered from their mental torture (Even if they say it's fucking DISCIPLINE like this is all goddamn bullshit I have to follow and then automatically respect them). Even after I managed to change my mom one day and if it comes to meeting my godparents once again, I vowed myself that if my godmother or godfather yells a single word at me, I'd feel like clenching my fists and bashing their faces in if I want to.\n\nIt's sorta one of the biggest painful aspects of my life's challenges at this very moment and I wished I wanted them OUT of my goddamn life.\n\nThank you for reading and I wish you all the best if you're facing a similar experience as I am facing right now.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678622246.0},{"title":"Parent REFUSES to get mental help","author":"throwawaysksl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11orzlc\/parent_refuses_to_get_mental_help\/","text":"My mom has always been crazy.

I'm a 28M and have been doing alot of self reflection lately, trying to figure out \"why am I the way I am\"\n\nIn a nutshell I'm a super anxious adult, I find myself always worried about something, and seem to view life through the lens of \"what if this doesn't work out\"\n\nSome facts about my childhood (in no particular order):\n\n1. Parents would always have screaming matches in front of me and my siblings, openly discuss their marriage issues, financial problems etc. From a very young age I found myself preoccupied with thoughts of \"what if we become poor\", \"what if they get a divorce\" , etc.\n2. Regular screaming\/beatings\/silent treatment as consequence for relatively trivial things, to the point where if anything ever went wrong whether that was a letter home from school, or I dropped\/broke a plate, I found myself in a permanent state of worry, \"what are my parents going to do\" At one point, during an argument my dad choked me for several seconds to get a rise out of my mom.\n3. I have never been proud of anything I have accomplished. Growing up grades were everything, If I didn't meet the bar I'd be ridiculed\/compared to my peers. If I did do well, the vibe I received was sort of a \"great, what you want a cookie?\" I even had to basically convince them to come to my high school\/Uni graduations; these were not milestones to be celebrated, rather \"I've done the bare minimum\"\n4. An obsession with \"what will others think\". I was never looked at as an individual, rather a representative of them and the family as a whole, I was raised to believe that was others think of me is of the highest importance.\n5. My friends were always labelled as \"distractions\", my parents would always put this narrative in my head that everyone is selfish and trying to get ahead, my \"friends\" just want an extra person to goof off with. They'd go as far as saying stuff like \"these guys aren't your friends, they just want more people around to keep things fun, they are using you\"\n6. No privacy on extreme levels, always going through my room (looking for a reason to get mad at me), reading texts over my shoulder, at one point I was told \"you're a kid, you don't get to keep secrets\" The few times Id bring friends over I know they'd be eavesdropping, eventually I stopped having people over all together.\n7. I have never discussed anything of emotional substance with my parents: girlfriends, career dreams, something that made me happy, something that made me sad, something that has me worried. If I were to die today, they have no clue who I am past the superficial facts they know about me. Growing up my parents were not a safe haven, anything I was dealing with, I dealt with alone, or confided in my friends.\n8. I was a chubby kid growing up, and I'm still a chubby adult now (working on it), this was also something they would regularly make comments about\n9. I could keep going for pages.... But ill end with saying alot of my buddies consider their parents their best friends, I have no idea how that feels like.\n\nAll that said I still feel in debt to my parents. They raised me at the end of the day, helped pay for my schooling, and so much more. I feel guilty trying to paint them as some sort of monsters. I have a really hard time trying to describe how I feel, they've given me so much, but have hurt me in so many other ways...\n\nTo the folks who took the time to read all this, what do you think ? how do these things manifest in adulthood, how can they be worked on? what is the way forward?","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678496650.0},{"title":"We don\u2019t owe parents shit!","author":"NobodyDesperate6313","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11o8p9x\/we_dont_owe_parents_shit\/","text":"Filial Piety is outdated and narrow-minded\n\nKids did not ask to be born and they do not owe their parents a goddamn thing.

AM is Japanese-Filipino. My AM holds two advanced degrees and teaches in university. Anyway, likely because of the bipolar and autism, my AM\u2019s impositions greatly affected me, which required extensive therapy to correct. It set me back around a decade; I was essentially in the care of my parents until I was in my late 20s because I couldn\u2019t be trusted to function on my own. \n\nNeedless to say, I was a fuck up in her eyes, someone to be pitied and hidden away.\n\nThe pandemic provided an opportunity to hard-reset. I looked for my own psychiatrist, someone I chose based on my needs, and she helped me secure a job that, well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s the sort of job an AM can brag about.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m here: two years later, about to resign from that job to prepare for a move to the States to pursue my MFA. I was admitted to my dream program and awarded a sizeable scholarship\u2014not a full ride, but it covers more than a quarter of my tuition. \n\nThese are things I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of achieving. I was perfectly happy to have been able to put myself and my work out there even though I had 0% confidence in my abilities. The admission + scholarship were just bonuses. The bottom line: I\u2019m finally happy, content, and confident. I have never felt this way before. And everyone around me is proud and supportive.\n\nNot AM. I, of course, have still not achieved enough, despite having juggled a high-stress position in a top corporation, her constant gaslighting and emotional abuse, and the application process, which required months of preparation.

Because I don't believe that buying me my favourite food or giving me \"peace offerings\" makes up for years of abuse which have shaped me into the broken, mangled mess of a woman I am today. \n\nI have, through some spectacular feat of imagination, managed to convince myself that I have a good relationship with my parents now. They acknowledge that they were abusive and wrong in my childhood, but that doesn't seem to really stop the cycle. It just manifests in a different way - put downs and political baiting from my father, and spineless cowardice from my mother. \n\nI keep myself so busy that I don't allow myself to sit, to feel, to grieve. To grieve the lack of unconditional love without cruelty in this house. To grieve that my parents would not protect me from themselves. That I was, as the oldest child, the guinea pig. Every expense I generated lorded over me, threatened, beaten bloody and blue, victim-blamed for being sexually assaulted, belittled and abused. \n\nThis is a trauma dump, make no mistake. I think I need to write this all out so I can see it and recognise it as the truth that they try to gaslight me out of. So if you're already bored, I'm sorry. Perhaps someone will read this and know they're not alone, and that'll do. \n\nI didn't ask for my father to work two jobs to send me to a private, expensive montesorri kindergarten. In much the same way that I didn't ask for him to molest me on a family holiday to Thailand. To barge into the bathroom while I showered since I wasn't allowed to lock the door. To throw me out of the house naked at 5 years old to teach me a lesson. To sit, cane in hand, ready to hit me while I was forced to eat treats I stole until I threw up.\n\nI didn't ask to be sent to the same school my mother taught at so I could experience the anxiety and pain of daily parent-teacher conferences. I didn't ask to be punished and put into \"therapy\" that regularly made me drink so much water I'd throw it up. I didn't ask to be shouted at and humiliated in front of classmates and teachers alike. To be body shamed into a recess time weight loss programme that trained 7 year old me to hate my body and think I'm fat. \n\nI'm now 25. I've survived self-harm (one year clean as of December!), persistent depressive disorder and suicide attempts. I have a somewhat successful career in writing, which I hope is apparent. I'm divorced and had to move back in with my parents, and have lived back home for nearly 2 years. In their own way, they are supportive and loving. But every so often I am tormented by these memories. Every so often, their masks slip and their inherent cruelty slithers through the cracks like a cockroach. Feelers waving, looking and searching for a whiff of vulnerability. \n\nIt's hard. I'm not sure that I will ever comfortably navigate this relationship, which still endures verbal and emotional abuse. Physical too, if you're my little sister. But for now, as I sit, reeling from how my father rendered me a sobbing mess after baiting me into a political \"discussion\" (my hot take was that war and death is bad re: Russia\/Ukraine), I'm forced to sit.

They're trying to make him memorize a holy book and he isnt that capable of it but they don't care. I feel like he needs to get checked up for adhd or autism or smth but they won't ever do that. Any advice? I'm very desperate at this point. I told him to tell me when stuff happened and he's been telling me but I haven't been able to change anything for him. Despite all this he seems to keep forgetting that our Nparents abuse him bc they also act extremely nice at times which isn't fair for him bc he rlly thinks our parents love him and that's how love works. Not only this but he has been starting to hit our youngest sister and get away with it and touch her in inappropriate places.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678386735.0},{"title":"How to stop giving into Asian parents demands or \u201chelp\u201d them","author":"OpeningVermicelli405","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11n2md0\/how_to_stop_giving_into_asian_parents_demands_or\/","text":"Hey all.

I guess some of them are just kinda messed up so it's not for the faint of heart.  \nAlso I flaired it as rant\/vent but idk if it is classed as that.\n\nBear with me, it's not weird. I've been in a dark place lately and I think about things my AP's have done more often. And I realised, there are so many stories about me vomiting and I actually have a fear of vomiting anywhere other than my toilet.\n\nThe three most memorable ones:\n\n\\- I remember I was like 5 or 6 maybe? and I was ill. Now when you're a small child and ill you just vomit wherever because you don't have the capacity to run to the bathroom and throw up there, my AM did not understand this. So when I vomited I threw up all over the bed (I used to sleep in the same bed as her since I was scared to be alone) and guess what she did? Throw me off the bed and yank me to the floor, then ripping the bedding off, screaming she's gonna make me lick it back up and calling me a pathetic little shit because I didn't run to the bathroom to throw up. I was just on the floor holding myself since being thrown hurts.\n\n\\- This was a car ride, so we were trapped! woohoo! I was around 8 or 9 here I think and I was feeling a little nauseous that day so I didn't want to sit in the middle of the car, but I was too scared to tell my parents that because they were getting mad I never sit in middle (why? I have no idea to this day) and about 30 minutes through the car journey, I asked for a bag because I felt sick. My mum started screaming at me because I'm not supposed to throw up in the car and if being in the middle made me sick I should've said. It also smells because, well, puke, so my dad rolls down all the windows making it freezing cold and letting everyone outside hear my mum shouting her head off, she then starts arguing with my dad about the window thing and it's all quite chaotic: my parents arguing, me vomiting, my siblings looking at me in disgust since I'm the reason it all started... very very fun times\n\n\\- Now here I was older, like 11 or so, and my grandma forced me to drink like 2 glasses of milk (she literally poured it down my throat) and we were watching a film and I felt sick. Now in the film, someone vomited, so I felt myself about to and from the millions of times before, I knew to only vomit in the bin\/toilet. So I ran to the kitchen bin but I didn't vomit, so I returned to the film. Then when I got upstairs, I was getting ready for bed and my older brother was occupying the bathroom and I was about to vomit. So I run in my mum's room and throw up in her bin because I can't get to the toilet. She starts yelling at the top of her lungs asking what the hell is wrong with me, vomiting in her bin, why I didn't go to the toilet. And you know when you vomit you cry? And getting yelled at as a child makes you cry? I was wailing, so she tells me to shut my trap. I stop vomiting and I'm just in absolute tears and she starts yelling at me to stop crying since there's no reason to. I tell her I'm crying because she's shouting at me for nothing. She then proceeds to tell she's not shouting at me, **while shouting at me** and saying I'm overreacting and I need to shut up, my older brother then chimes in saying I'm being a baby crying over nothing, so I cried more. \n\nAnyways that's the most memorable ones, now that I think about it there are so many involving someone throwing up and yelling or hitting happening.

I know it's the most logical answer in a toxic family situation but I can't just get out. I share closets with my parents, my documents are all mixed up with theirs, I have no friends I could bunk with or rely on in a situation. I don't have cash, I share my bank account with a parent because it was made when I was a minor, they can track and access it. I have a degree which won't get me a good paying job unless I learn extra skills (which I have no motivation for anymore). I have low self esteem which is valid to some extent because I have nothing to love myself for. I've abused my body and it's slowly deteriorating, I don't have hobbies or skills, I am not funny or charming. And I'm stuck with no job, no ongoing education, no friends, no motivation to do anything. I've stopped trying to decipher why my parents do the things they do but I know things don't have to be this way. There's a very easy solution out if only they spoke to each other without getting in a fight for once. They get angry for the most petty reasons and I can't speak up to them at all. I've been grey-rocking my entire life but now that I'm an adult I'm expected to act an adult and participate in their fights otherwise I'm a selfish apathetic child. I don't think my parents realise what they're doing. They seem to be in denial about a lot of things. They aren't actively trying to hurt anyone but when they get angry, they lose braincells and do things that they forget about the next day. I feel like I'm paying some sort of debt for living in their house. If you're going to tell me to stand up or fight back or anything, I'm going to tell you right now I can't do that. I barely feel human. I've had to repress emotions all my life, it feels extremely uncomfortable to confront or even say something when they're being abusive. Even when I'm with others, I just automatically say what I know the person wants to hear. I thought I was doing the right thing by not doing anything but I've realised it doesn't matter what I do\/don't do, my life will still get affected by whatever my parents decide. I don't know what I'm trying to say, I'm sorry if this is too vague or filled with self pity or something. My thoughts are very scattered and I'm annoyed by myself for not doing anything to fix anything about my life. I thought I had a plan on how to move out but that requires me to study intensively and I can't do that. I have no motivation or discipline to act on any of my plans and I've been reading about how people make their lives better and I keep thinking, I'm not brave or hardworking or something like them. I know I will give up after a few days. I know I can't do anything productive unless there's accountability. I feel hopeless, boring, lonely and empty and there's a continuous existential dread in my mind that occasionally gets repressed because of other shitty things going on. I could rant forever but I'm already wondering if this has become too annoying and if anybody will actually make it this far. I don't know what I want out of this, I think I've started craving attention from internet strangers too much.\nHope you have a good day :')","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678379890.0},{"title":"What's the biggest disappointment your family's given you to date?","author":"MaverickACM44","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11mpw04\/whats_the_biggest_disappointment_your_familys\/","text":"Let's see what you may have to say...","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678361554.0},{"title":"Bad examples","author":"paradoxiallyalive","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11mx6jy\/bad_examples\/","text":"I love my mom.

Let me preface by saying, I\u2019ve been reading this sub for years and can relate to the majority of these posts. \n\nMy parents (mostly my dad, he was the dominant one) never got physical but let\u2019s just say they were emotionally negligent at best and not-quite-abusive but-very-harsh at worst. They also were very strict and critical of everything I did so it just taught me to hide everything and never share anything about myself to them. Any time I asked a question led to getting berated about my intelligence, a lecture about saving money, and a warning about how I would become homeless. \n\nAs a result, my adolescence was filled with resentment and impatience to just GTFO. When I reflect on my 20s, I can see how my upbringing caused me to max out my credit card while I was in college (never taught about finances), enter an emotionally abusive relationship, and spend years adrift with bouts of low self-confidence and no sense of identity that I feel have held me back in my career\/other arenas of life tbh.\n\nI\u2019m about to turn 32 now and after many years of therapy, coaching, and reflecting I see my parents for who they are: traumatized immigrants who escaped famine and are stuck in a survival mindset. I\u2019ve also let go of expecting any acknowledgement or behavior change on their part. \n\nMy resentment wanes from seeing them get older but a lot of old patterns remain. I still get exasperated with my dad often but nowhere near the explosive blowups from when I was a teen. \n\nI got hit with an IG ad for this card game called Parents are Human (not sponsored in any way) and gave it a try as I related so much to the founder\u2019s story. It led to some breakthroughs like when my dad shed a few tears telling me about his traumatic upbringing. It\u2019s been promising but sometimes it feels like one step forward and two steps back because I realize I still carry some inner-child wounds which trip us up sometimes. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m just curious if there are others out here in a similar phase in life, how you\u2019re dealing with it (if at all), and how it\u2019s going?","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678310640.0},{"title":"My mom came unannounced to get her pillow cases","author":"Milkteaplease","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11mdf26\/my_mom_came_unannounced_to_get_her_pillow_cases\/","text":"My mom just got back from being in China for two months after I spent a long time convincing her to go.

For me, they wanted me to find a man who was financially stable and 10 years older than me. For them, it was more about what a man can provide for me and how they can help me become motivated to pursue things in life. When I started dating my now fianc\u00e9, they would always critique him and say how lazy he is and how unmotivated he was. Ever since I had surgery on my ovaries, they told me having a child is the happiest thing ever so they tried to convince me to get pregnant with him and then leave him. Anyways, since I was raised on the importance of money, status, and family, it effected my relationship. I started criticizing him little by little too. He was not a hardcore go getter, he did not work 12 hours like I have, he would play games after work, he didn't read or like to explore new things like me. It went on for a while but he was always so patient. I had forgotten about how he encouraged me to take breaks and find time for myself, he made sure that I was taken care of before playing his games, he would help clean and cook, he never expected me to do anything and would join me when I did chores. I think the most important thing was that he never criticized anyone and would always seek both sides of the story. When I decided to move in with him, he knew how important money was and how I did not like to spend so he went to the bank and opened a joint account with half of his savings in there telling me \"Whenever you need it, just use it.\" When he bought a new tv, I decided to connect my phone through Bluetooth and he named the TV with both of our names. I thought that little gesture was so nice. He also pushes me to be independent and whatever business I want to pursue, he will work hard and help me with it. He isn't lazy or unmotivated, he just knows how to balance work, goals, and free time.

Things have been tough. I started talking to my current boyfriend(21M Indian Malayalee ) after meeting him on Bumble in December. We hit off right away and we went on 2 dates before i went India for an entire month\u2026 We continued talking again everyday by texting and calling and at the end of the month he asked me to his girlfriend. This is my first serious relationship and I have thought long and hard about qualities I like in someone and of course all the practical aspects like religion,kids, lifestyle etc and we always had open communication on these matters to be aligned. So I believe that we will last and I don\u2019t doubt his love for me. I trust my decision and hope everything works out for the best. \n\nOnce I came back from India, I started internship near my boyfriend\u2019s university(where he dorms). I went over to his room a lot because we enjoyed spending time together and we obviously fooled around abit as well. And there was a period his parents went overseas so I went over to his house and we cooked together, did puzzle and just watched some shows. Been a very happy few months :) That was until my parents found out\u2026 I was sneaking around because I know they won\u2019t be so open-minded about dating. I had a group chat with my cousins and I thought it was a safe space for me to share about my boyfriend(all the way from how we met). I also asked that they don\u2019t share this with their parents. \n\nHowever, much to my horror last Monday night while I was out for dinner with my friend, my dad called me and demanded I come home immediately. He asked me to take a taxi home as he wanted me there ASAP. This was very traumatising and I felt like they found out. I was very upset and I called my mum to ask what\u2019s going on and they were making me panic. She just said why am I panicking if I did nothing wrong. I called my boyfriend immediately and he was providing me with emotional support as I was so scared to face them. Least to say it was as I expected. They had found out about my boyfriend. My dad demanded I hand over my phone and looked through our entire gallery. All the pictures of us. Some where I\u2019m in my boyfriend\u2019s jersey or t shirt(i\u2019m fully covered). He slapped me and I was crying asking him to stop looking through them. I was being humiliated extremely. He then tells me I am free to choose the man I want to marry but he can\u2019t let me be this close to my boyfriend. \n\nHe wants me to only meet my boyfriend at public places for max a few hours ONCE A WEEK. I am not allowed to go over to his house or room. Since then, my life has been torn apart. I am not allowed to use my phone past 10pm. I am not allowed to go out after work during the weekdays. I am not allowed to go out the entire day on weekends. My dad also demanded that my boyfriend tell his parents about us cause he\u2019s worried they won\u2019t approve(they will\u2026 they are very chill parents and his sister is engaged to a chinese man). Since then I feel like i\u2019m in jail. I cant do anything at home. I feel like I\u2019m always being watched. My parents blame themselves for me turning out this way. My dad threatens to kill himself if I go to my boyfriend\u2019s room again. My younger sister 14F knew about my boyfriend since December and she has also met him\nonce. She likes him alot as he is a kind and sweet man. My parents were beyond angry that I told my sister because she\u2019s just a \u2018child\u2019. By sharing this with her, I am influencing her. I\u2019m affecting her. I\u2019m ruining her life. They keep threatening to go back to India with my sister if I don\u2019t follow their rules. They say I cant do whatever I want and they are doing it for my best\u2026 My dad also claims that he \u2018lets\u2019 me study, work and go on exchange etc so I should be appreciative LOL. Only good thing is I will be going away on exchange to Germany from 1st April so I\u2019ll be living a long way from them for 4 months and I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll feel better. Throughout this, my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive and not once trashed my family for being this way. He is always willing to listen to my rants and trying to do whatever he can to help me. He doesn\u2019t mind meeting me lesser or having all these restrictions if it means that we can be together \ud83e\udd79 \n\nMy parent\u2019s idea that you only date the man you are going to marry is so outdated and stupid. All my dad said was it\u2019s not his values and he doesn\u2019t trust my hormones(LOL CAUSE of the pics of me in my boyfriend\u2019s t shirt he automatically thinks of the worst). I intended to graduate end of May 2024 but with all this, I want to get out of the house ASAP. I\u2019m planning to squeeze my courses to be completed by December this year. Today he called me to tell me my sister was stressed and she had some chest pain and tjay I shouldn\u2019t cause any more issues LMAO. We had an hour long argument where I was very emotional and felt so upset. I told him i\u2019ll move out after I graduate and he said he won\u2019t talk to me because he won\u2019t be alive if I did that. My mum throughout this has been constantly telling me \u201cit\u2019s enough that we trusted you this much\u201d. I don\u2019t understand why I have to live like a criminal in my own house. I have no freedom. I have no say all because I\u2019m living under their roof. I\u2019m at a loss for what to do. I sought therapy after these events and went for my first session. I love my boyfriend very much and wish time will just move faster so that we can get married and be happy. I feel like that\u2019s the only way I can get peace.

As a son and being responsible, I've been sending them $350 USD every month to cover their day to day expenses which I think is enough for them to live and eat. Apart from that I send emergency money for medical treatments and festivals which is like a bonus about $2k every year. Recently my mother has been calling about helping her buy a car because it's her wish and she is getting old and want to enjoy her life. I said I cannot afford to buy her car but she insists that she will pay back some amount of money later and emotionally blackmail me saying that I;m not being a good son and I've changed and been listening to my wife only. She was telling me that she has about 10k saved and I'd need to add remaining money to purchase the car. This is not the first time she asked for money. 2-3 years back she asked money to do heavy expenses for their home and I had to send 15k in two months time. Apart from that I had already sent 3k for a motorcycle purchase and more than 10k for her to save money (I was not married and used to give her half my salary to save - though I did not make much then) and I occasionally buy them new smartphones, apple watch etc. as gifts . Now that I have a wife (no kids), we make 150-200k a year and have been working our ass off to be financially independent in 8-10 years time. We already paid our for our house and have 1 rental unit and have plans to buy next rental this year. I said to my mother that I have already plan to buy a house this year but she suggested me that I help her buy car instead any then think about buying a home next year lol.  My wife is okay with sending them pocket money but completely disagree sending them huge amount of money for their lifestyle, in which I agree because it's not a life threatening scenario where they are sick and need money for treatment as it is something materialistic. Whereas my mother argues that it is her dream to drive a car and I've to fulfill their need when it's needed and their life is too short and they have done so much for me. And I think that is also right because they raised me, fed me, paid for my whole tuition fees which they sacrificed in their time which they could have used to have a better lifestyle.

We both go to T20 schools, which is \\~3 hours apart, and are CS majors. Every chance I get (roughly every two weeks), I would drive down to spend the weekend with her. However, since her spring break started early, she decided to come up and visit me.\n\nLong story short, we took a picture (Polaroid) at a cat caf\u00e9 this past weekend and her mom apparently found it in her pocket when doing her laundry. She confessed to them about everything today, which took roughly 2 hours.

So if you combine no money, not alot of free time and not being allowed to choose, you just get no fucking hobbies or interest during your childhood, and the worse is that i though it was normal, the only reason why i didn't break while being a child was because i though that there was no alternative, and they are really good at manipulating people into thinking there is no alternative.

Ever since I was younger, my mom would always control and tiger parent me, like pretty typical, but I think it's gotten worse over the recent years. I'm a 16F and in high school, but I've never been to a sleep over, haven't been to a single birthday party or day with my friends in my whole high school, never been to a school dance, and haven't been allowed to have friends or have contact with my friends from school. (ofc i have friends but my mom doesn't really know that; she thinks all classmates are competition and thus I shouldn't socialize). My mom is primarily the cause for all this, and she's always been strict, but recently she argues with me every single day about a multitude of different things, like spending too much time on looks, grades, or whatever she wants to argue about. My dad recommends I just take the yelling and say sorry for whatever I've done, because whenever I argue back it usually doesn't turn out well. In these arguments and through the typical Asian American experience, she yells at me for being a failure and being a money waster, and threatens to send me to a different school constantly. I understand that expenses to raise me are high, but I wish she'd understand that threatening me and yelling at me everyday about money and grades won't change anything.\n\nIn my opinion, she's a weirdly insensitive person. **(TW for the next paragraph of Self Harm.)** Because it's gotten so bad, a few months ago I started self-harming. Looking in hindsight, I think I might've done it because I internally thought for once she'd feel sorry for how she treated me everyday, but when she found out about it because I blurted out that I self-harmed when we had an argument, she didn't care at all. She definitely registered it, she saw the scars, but she didn't do anything about it. My dad cared a lot and talked to me about my future and how I'm throwing it away from what I'm doing (I love him), but the only thing my mom said was that she would send me to a mental hospital if it happened again. There was no compassion or concern about the way she said it, she just wanted another leverage to use against me. I'm clean now, but her reaction is definitely something I'll remember.\n\nWhile I know a lot of parents are like this, and I'm not the only one with this experience, it was definitely eye opening to see an asian friend of mine actually have a solid relationship with her mother. I was roommates with this girl for a school trip recently, let's call her Amanda, and Amanda would call her mom everyday. Of course Amanda would complain (we're teens!!!) about her mom stressing over whether she had eaten a meal and gotten sleep for the day, but every time I saw a text or call from Amanda's mom I'd wish that her mom was mine. Amanda's mom would congratulate her for working so hard for the school trip, and when Amanda thought she didn't win something that she really wanted to, her mom comforted her telling her everything would be okay. I wish when I was gone my mom cared about my health and cared about my well being and that she comforted me when I was down. I don't know if this vastly different experience is because my friend actually has good grades and placed in competitions and is the ideal asian child, but I wish my mom was like hers.\n\nI think I sort of understand where she's coming from, I'm also stressed about general things like college and grades, and can't imagine what would happen if I didn't into a college. I think she might be taking everything out on me because of partially work stress but also stress about my future, but I wish she'd just understand that taking everything out on me isn't going to decrease my stress or workload in any way. I'm tired of this whole thing and just please please want to get into a good college and leave the house. I want to take on debt and pay back everything she's ever paid for me so I never have to be threatened by her again. Thank you so much if you've read this far, idk if my thoughts are really valid because I feel like a lot of parents are like this, but I really needed this vent and was tired of venting to white counselors at my school who didn't understand. :) !!!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678239396.0},{"title":"Why would parents not want you to pursue your passion?

Long time lurker here, using a throwaway account. This post may be pretty long.\n\n\n\nEver since I got a job, my mom has been asking me for money to help around the house and other family matters. I figured I can help since I live with them for free, along with free expensive dinners and whatnot, but I feel that the money I give them isn't really appreciated beyond giving me basic necessities to live. I also helped my dad with fixing his car by lending him a lot of cash, which contributed to me feeling like I'm a stingy person for not spending much money, because I've seen it go away really quickly. I feel my parents aren't the best at acknowledging my feelings.\n\n\n\nEarlier, I had an argument with my mom about how I acted towards my grandparents who live at the other side of the world. I normally dread conversation with them because my grandfather always mentions something that brings out trauma in my head, and she calls me over just to make them feel entertained. In the call, they were congratulating me, which I can appreciate, then my grandmother asked me if I'm going to be making a blowout or a celebration for them. I can't tell that some things are jokes sometimes depending on who I'm talking with, and I did just have dinner with my immediate family with me paying the restaurant bills, so I assumed I'm the one going to pay for all this. I turned to my mom and said that they never talked to me about this.\n\n\n\nThen comes my grandfather, who proceeds to ask me about stuff that brings out trauma in my head. I was really, really uncomfortable about this, while they keep saying I'm just being shy about it. Back to my grandmother, she said the blowout thing was a joke. I apologized to her because I didn't think it was actually a joke, and I took that seriously. Exchanging thank yous, love yous, and byes, I left the conversation.\n\n\n\nWhile I was cleaning the kitchen my mom called me over about it. She talked about how rude I was being for even asking her if they talked to me about making a blowout for them. I told her that I didn't take it as a joke and assumed they were being serious about it. Then she told me that I should go along with what they're saying because they're old, to which I replied that they should at least consider how I feel about them saying stuff like that.\n\n\n\nThen she argues about how it would feel if she doesn't even let me join in their conversations, and about how it would feel if a family member got sick, requesting cash to pay hospital bills, where she would ask if they ever talked about this with her. I tried to stand up for myself by advocating my feelings and how I felt during that conversation, and she brings it around by saying that I need to think about what my grandparents feel and adapt because they're not like her.\n\n\n\nMy mom started crying as she talked about her parents\/my grandparents because they're old and they don't have much years left, and that they're forgetful, they don't know, and she talked about how she may not feel that she's starting to forget things but she can feel it. I just told her what I think she wanted to hear, that I don't respect my elders and I need to learn how to respect them, that I expect people to have the same level of thinking as I do, and that I should never forget who raised me and where I came from, so I have to respect them, nevermind how I feel.\n\n\n\nIn the end, she basically trashed my case about my feelings by saying the word \"feelings\" repeatedly in a condescending tone, as if they didn't matter.\n\n\n\nI feel really bad and conflicted right now. My mom would compare me to unruly kids whenever I have bad grades in the past, and would compare me with my friends if they were more successful than I am. My mom brought up how depressed I was a couple of times and laughed it off as if I was just acting up. My mom would at times make me feel like a bad person for even asking if my dad's going to eat whatever food is left for lunch at work by saying how greedy I was. My mom would congratulate me on my accomplishments then mention that I'm just like her. My mom would sometimes call me derogatory names when I don't meet her expectations. My mom would always tell me that I should be grateful because she put a roof over my head and provided for me and still is, and I have to respect her even when she does things that would hurt my feelings.\n\n\n\nIf someone can be brutally honest with me, I beg you. Please do so. I know there's some miscommunication involved here, I don't know. It's really hard to open up to family when I feel like this. Maybe I'm the wrong one here, but I'm refusing to accept it. I really want to be better as this guilt is eating me alive.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678167285.0},{"title":"Wishing I had parents","author":"The_Big_Sad_69420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11k6d3k\/wishing_i_had_parents\/","text":"Like, real parents.

I pay more rent to live in the city where there's public transport because owning a car would drain my savings.\n\nIn the meantime, my mom rants to me about her life every time we call, asks me for new phones, and asks me to take her on expensive vacations.

First of all, I'm an Asian American female in my 30's and currently interested in two guys (I know, this is already starting out bad). One guy I met through an online dating app. The other I met through another sub on reddit (which is why I'm posting anon).  I'm already unsure of which guy I like better - while mentally I like the guy from reddit better (he's very sweet, nice, genuine, and responds to messages quickly), I had previously already been on a date with the other guy (before I started talking to the reddit guy) and feel I have stronger feelings for him that aren't over yet (this is despite that he is really slow to respond to texts, and when I asked him if he wanted to go on a second date, took 25 hours to reply with a yes, and now responds to texts literally like once a day).\n\nNow I don't have a huge support system, and I get along with my parents pretty well, so I shared some of this stuff, but in more detail, with both of them individually. At first my dad was supportive and said the guy from reddit seems like he is more serious about me.  Then I had a conversation with my mom, while my dad was there, and they've both decided that neither of them is good enough for me.  While I have a bachelor's degree and have completed part of a master's program, neither of these guys have a college degree and both have working class jobs.\n\nMy mom asked me what I think is important, and I said personality. But she says what's more important is, essentially, can you make a living together and start a family? Can you feed yourself on personality? Does he own or rent his place? How much does he have in savings? Not to mention, of course, that their jobs aren't good enough. My mom said something like, \"You're putting your life down as collateral\" when you date someone. I would be making a huge mistake if I dated either of them. She also said it is too dangerous to meet people online.\n\nI used to also think that education and jobs defined people in a way, but I went through a really dark period in my own life, which led me to decide there are more important things than a person's job or education. For one, can you understand each other on the level of having gone through difficulties?  I think that is extremely hard to find among people who have higher educations and have only been in the upper classes. I don't want to be with someone just because they have a fancy degree, who doesn't understand me on the level of having suffered.\n\nAnyway, what are your opinions about this kind of advice coming from Asian parents?

I dream of freedom one day, being able to decide things for myself without parents meddling, going out to partying and gaining connections without curfew and restrictions and just no more hassle and anxiety.\n\nBased on what comes in my mind, I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m 100% ready to move out in the future because I don\u2019t want to be hit with unexpected surprises. I also wouldn\u2019t want to move back as there\u2019s no going back after that. From what I can analyze, I still need to learn how to cook, that\u2019s the main thing. Laundry, I know some of it, just have to remember how much detergent to add. Rent, my job from my degree would pay 90-100k so I should be able to pay it off per month. I also pay my credit card bills  on time so I\u2019m not financially irresponsible.\n\nBesides that, what else do I need to live alone successfully?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678093500.0},{"title":"My younger brother just destroyed my project","author":"maybeiamuseless","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11joj71\/my_younger_brother_just_destroyed_my_project\/","text":"My parents are blaming me for provoking him (when i was washing dishes) or leaving it out in the open (it was a painting that needs to dry) Ive been crying about it nonstop not because of the project but because if our roles were reversed my parents might as well have killed me.

I was a pretty normal fucking child by any realistic standard. I didn't always do my chores in a timely manner, sure, or I forgot to defrost the chicken sometimes. But for the most part I tried to do what I was told. And even then I was treated like I was possessed by Satan for being your average teenager. My Asian dad would constantly ramble about how no one could ever love me or that I'd end up homeless because unlike everyone on the planet I was a weak spineless parasite or I was a pathetic human being. I was treated cruelly for mistakes that were common for my stage of development and the punishment I was given rarely fit my crime.\n\nSo yeah, I wasn't a bad kid. The majority of us were not.

I feel APs are so shitty in this regard.\n\n\nWhen my father was teaching me how to drive, it was literally just constant yelling and screaming for 40 minutes, him forcefully taking the wheel from the passenger seat, and screaming at me vague shit like \"TURN LEFT TURN LEFT\" and when I would ask like \"when and how much\" he would scream at me to \"just listen\" and as I'm turning left he would scream \"NO TURN RIGHT NOW TURN RIGHT.\" It just becomes a bunch of commands rather than actual learning. It's like, imagine you're taking a test and you're being told what pencil strokes to make for each individual answer rather than how to solve the questions. That's what it felt like.\n\n\nAnd don't even get me started on cooking.\n\n\nLike they cannot fathom mistakes happening or me not understanding it the first time. Mind you I have a license because my parents forced me to get it at the age of 16 against my wishes by hiring an instructor, then decided not to trust me with driving or a car (which is fine, we live in NYC so a car is pretty inconvenient). I've driven a handful of times after I got my license and that was more than 3 years ago, and now he's saying how he wasted all that money (whose fault is that) and how other people picked it up so easily so why can't I?\n\n\nI mean I could ask the same thing to him about even more important things. He doesn't know how to do anything with technology or his phone or dashcam besides downloading apps and deleting them. He doesn't know how to manage our finances or pay bills or do our taxes (my mom does that and he's having my mom teach me and my brother, which is good, but he's not willing to learn himself). And my mom is equally helpless with certain things that my father has to do for her, including anything regarding house repairs like fixing a clogged toilet, a leaky faucet, anything regarding car maintenance, etc. Anything we don't know how to do we're told \"we have to learn,\" all with yelling and screaming with the worst fucking teachers in the world. But anything they don't know how to do and rely on each other to do for them, we have to figure out.\n\n\nWorst part is they always say stuff like \"what are you going to do when we die? You have to learn some day.\" Fair point, for some things that are important. But then they say stuff like \"when I die, you're going to need to take care of your mom\/dad and do this stuff for them.\" Like if you're going to give us such a fucking hard time learning with your squawking and not being perfect instantly, then why don't you learn the shit you don't know yourself?\n\n\nI'd also add that my father is very particular with his food and very neurotic about his car (once he found a tiny scratch while it was parked and was pissed for 2 weeks).

I\u2019m gonna go on a bit of a rant. I (23F) have been with my bf (23M, white) for two years and a few months now. My AM doesn\u2019t like him as much as he isn\u2019t from the same background as me. He also happens to be autistic and my mother has explicity told me she doesn\u2019t want autistic grandchildren (even though I\u2019ve told her I would like to be childfree in the future)\n\nHow the hell do I get her to like him???\n\nI can\u2019t even sleep over at my bf\u2019s house without her having a complete meltdown. She tells me I don\u2019t have any respect for myself because I\u2019m the one who chooses to go to my bf\u2019s house. Note: my bf lives with his grandmother, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll be completely home alone. I would get my bf to come over to mine but he doesn\u2019t feel welcome and respected by my mother. My mum claims that she\u2019s not rude and tries to talk to him when he\u2019s visiting me. She also claims that she hasn\u2019t shown any disrespect towards him infront of him. But she talks shit behind his back and can\u2019t wait for the day we break up. I haven\u2019t told my bf that the main reason she doesn\u2019t like him is because he\u2019s autistic. I find this ironic because autism and learning disabilities runs in my mum\u2019s side of the family and two of my cousins have speech and learning problems. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of my mother not giving my bf approval despite us being together for 2 years (and us being friends 2 years before we got together) My bf said that he finds it a bit embarassing when we can\u2019t even sleep over at each other\u2019s houses and go on couple trips together, when other couples have moved in together. I agree because our friends laugh at us when we tell them the issue with my mum. It\u2019s embarassing to be 23 and to still be treated like I\u2019m in high school.\n\nLike I\u2019m literally 23. Why can\u2019t I sleep over at my bf\u2019s house without any issues? Why can\u2019t she just be fine with it so I don\u2019t have to feel guilty. It\u2019s hard to find a decision that satisfies both my mum and my bf. He\u2019s my first bf too which is why I\u2019m still learning. \n\nI tried standing up to her today and saying that I want to sleep over at my bf\u2019s house because we barely see each other (due to our day offs not matching up. He works Mondays to Fridays. I work Wednesdays to Sundays) I wish I could just sleep over once a week so that we could maximise spending time together.\n\nMy mum\u2019s argument was that my contract job ends end of April, so I can see him then. But that makes no sense cos why would I wait til April to see my boyfriend. I also just want to sleepover because I need a break from my mum, even for one evening. \n\nI would move out but rent prices are expensive in my country. I\u2019m waiting til mid year to move out into a sharehouse with my friends. I\u2019m just sick of my mother for being so overprotective even though I\u2019m 23 and have a full time job. Her overprotectiveness has ruined many things in my life. I just don\u2019t want it to ruin my relationship. \n\nNote: she\u2019s allowed me to go on trips to my bf\u2019s hometown 3 times already (they were 4-7 day trips) and was fine about it. I don\u2019t understand why a one night sleepover is a big deal. Me telling her I want to sleepover is apparently \u201cpushing her boundaries\u201d and that\u2019s too much for her.\n\nTL;DR my mum won\u2019t let me sleepover at my bf\u2019s house because according to her \u201cI have no respect for my self\u201d\n\nEdit: I\u2019m an only child hence her overprotectiveness\n\nEdit again: I do plan on moving out around June with a friend of mine and her best friend. We\u2019re just trying to earn as much money as we can so it looks good for rental applications. I can\u2019t afford to move out by myself as rental prices are insane in my city and I don\u2019t earn that much money at my job.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678077404.0},{"title":"Asians families have no manners ?

I\u2019ve brought up therapy to my parents multiple times, and I\u2019ve been shut down every single time because they believe I\u2019m \u201cnot psycho\u201d and \u201cshould be grateful I have a roof over my head.\u201d\n\nI grew up with spanking being a very familiar disciplinary method. Belts, slippers, even a metal pole once. That, combined with my parents rejecting my sexuality and berating me whenever I bring up ANY personal problems, have caused me to shut myself off from them. \n\nI\u2019ll list some of the things I grew up with: \n\n1. When I was 9, I wanted to eat a piece of Halloween candy after eating a slice of cheesecake. My dad forced me to eat ALL of the Halloween candy I got that year (a lot) and didn\u2019t leave the house until I was already crying and gagging. My mom helped me throw away the rest of the candy (about half left atp) once he left. \n\n2. When I was 15, my dad caught me talking to a guy friend at the bus stop. He took my phone and went through my contacts and text messages, even deleting my Instagram account because he saw I had male followers. \n\n3. When I was 17, I was outed as bisexual after my dad went through my phone and saw messages between me and a talking stage I had a falling out with. He said my sexuality was a \u201cburden\u201d on him because he couldn\u2019t tell anyone, and that they \u201cdidn\u2019t raise me this way.\u201d\n\n4. Throughout middle school and high school, he would be angry whenever I got B\u2019s. A-\u2018s were already pushing it. He would spank me for B\u2019s in middle school. This has stemmed into my intense fear of failure and tying my worth to my grades. \n\nDespite the things I went through, I\u2019m just glad my younger sister (10F) is not going through that same physical treatment. If it ever comes down to it, I\u2019ll always get in between my sister and my dad. I don\u2019t want her to grow up as traumatized as I did.\n\nI\u2019m done being scared of asking for help. Since my parents aren\u2019t supportive of me getting therapy, I\u2019m getting help in secret at therapy provided by my college. I had my first session last Thursday, and I opened up about the generational trauma. The way my therapist classified it as abuse made me feel so validated (she\u2019s South Asian and had a similar upbringing as me). I nearly cried tears of relief mid-session. I\u2019ve known I\u2019ve needed help since I was 16, and I finally found the courage to do so. \n\nThis is only the first step, but baby steps are still steps forward. I\u2019m proud of myself for finally getting professional help. I\u2019ll finally start to heal.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678053808.0},{"title":"korean comic is a banger when you're depressed all the time","author":"stinkyshin2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11jq4c7\/korean_comic_is_a_banger_when_youre_depressed_all\/","text":"love that guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhard relate when im depressed as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsteven he is there if you're happy or want a good laugh. korean comic when you're depressed as shit.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678082207.0},{"title":"If you ever became a parent, what would you (not) do something from your childhood?","author":"dan3009iel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11jd3r7\/if_you_ever_became_a_parent_what_would_you_not_do\/","text":"It can be positive or negative.

It's being a shallow person and having a bad filter.\n\nFor example, we know how Asian Parents (AP) will openly nitpick on anyone's appearance to a pretty extreme extent. Dissing someone's looks isn't unique to Asians, but my family members can be insufferable about it. Unfortunately the APs pass it on to their children.\n\nFor example, when I watched t.v. with my sister, she used to always trashed someone's looks: \"Why is she an actress? She has an ugly nose!\". She will sometimes go on a long rant about it. Of course, she would sometimes do it to people's faces too like our parents and older relatives do. I would overhear her AA friends doing it too. For years I tried to tell her to at least keep those thoughts to herself if she's going to be so shallow. Heck, I've had mean thoughts too, but I know it's shitty to say it out loud. If you stop yourself from saying it out loud, it's because you know it's wrong. Her filter finally kicked in after college.\n\nI've had Asian American friends doing it too. One AA friend did it so much that our Hispanic friend was taken aback and told him off. My friendship with this AA friend didn't last more than a year for multiple reasons. One of them being that he impulsively nitpicked on people's looks. He was obviously very insecure because he also impulsively lied. No surprise, he complained about his dad harshly criticizing him growing up.\n\nAnother AA friend did it as well. We were talking about dating outside our race. She then said she would date a non-Asian but not black people. I didn't care why because we're not obligated to be attracted to anyone. But then she felt the need to explain why: \"I don't like their noses, because they're too big.\" If I didn't call her out, she would have kept going. She would also complain about her mom fixating on her looks negatively.\n\nOf course not all of my Asian friends have been like this, but I noticed that collectively they have done it way more than my non Asian friends. The most that the non Asian friends would say is: \"Oh they're ugly.\" or \"I'm not interested.\" They won't give a whole speech about it or let a really offensive thought pass their filter. Even with social media showing mean comments all the time, there's still a wide gap, at least in my experience.\n\nBut it's just bizzare seeing how Asians and some of their AA children openly say it in person, just completely lacking any tact. It's annoying to see APs passing it off to their children. Hope the generational trauma eventually ends.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677971733.0},{"title":"Asian parents when you have money","author":"stinkyshin2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11irnw7\/asian_parents_when_you_have_money\/","text":"AP: yea you should get a job for job experience and earn cash on the side\n\nAlso AP: why you waste money we buy x y z for you you waste money don\u2019t waste money lah save it lah","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678004241.0},{"title":"Got told that my communication skills suck","author":"ranych","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11ipkx2\/got_told_that_my_communication_skills_suck\/","text":"I mean they\u2019re probably not wrong since I do get worked up when people start blaming me for things plus I\u2019m not a big talker.

I will preface this by saying that I am a female in my 20s from a South Asian background.\n\nMy father is the biggest manchild I have ever met.\n\nMy father relies on my mother for everything, even things that are specific to HIS job. Booking any flights or hotels, organising (and sometimes doing) his online work and appointments, and on top of all this, my mother is the one to do all other housework and paperwork to keep our life together. My father goes to work, does what he does with clients, and then comes home and watches TV for the rest of the night.

I cannot believe that being in a loving, equal partnership with someone is too 'high' of an expectation.\n\nI apologise to Asian men, I know there are exceptions to every rule, but I've personally seen so few exceptions of this in my life.

This is sort of one that's around Asian parenting and my parents' limitations as emotionally immature Asian parents. I always wanted to do sports as a kid and craved it. Instead, I was forced to do piano until I was probably 9 or 10, but I wanted to do sports like soccer. I never did, but there was one season when my mom signed me up for baseball when I was 10. I wasn't very good at it, but I loved it so much. I was fast but couldn't hit a ball. I mostly played in the outfield where they hid the kids, but I loved being part of the team, having friends in it, getting snacks, and wearing uniforms with my teammates. After the season, the coach saw that I was fast and recommended to my parents that I take up track. \"Yeah, definitely,\" I said. So, my dad took me to this tryout or practice for track. When we got there at the high school track, you could see all these kids who have probably been doing this for years, and my dad saw that I was so outclassed. But you could see he was just intimidated as an Asian man in the world that he was not comfortable with. Although he was a strong guy, a contractor, he just shrunk like a coward, and we left. I vaguely remember the conversation with my mom about how I was outclassed. I think that's what hurt the most - the fact that he and they had no confidence. But I think it was a combination of their own fears and doubt in me. I remember that moment so vividly as a failure of my Asian parents. And for some reason, I never did any more sports in middle school.\n\nI think I was in 10th grade when I found taekwondo, which I kind of thrust on them. I did it and did well. I got my black belt and became an instructor in college. Eventually, I took it really seriously and competed at a national level, earned a medal at collegiate nationals as a black belt, trained with Olympians, and fought with the best. I'm certain that I did that because of a lack of sports in my youth. I wanted to always be an \"athlete,\" so I took a sport or activity that most kids do as an elementary school kid and turned it into a real sport.\n\nI'm an adult now, but these are things that my Asian parent lingers.

This is only applicable for USA.\n\nLiving with Asian Parents is hard and can destroy your mental health in the long term. It\u2019s very hard to go no contact, and your feelings are valid if you feel that way. The best thing to do is distance yourself from them while not completely cutting off contact unless they\u2019re unacceptably toxic.\n\n1. Once you\u2019re 16, start working part-time. Save your money. Work full-time all summer and save up. Yes, it\u2019s sad, but you need money to eventually move out.\n\n2. By your junior year, have all the scholarships and colleges you plan to apply. \n\n3. As a high school senior, apply to as many scholarships as possible. You need money, and you don\u2019t want to financially depend on your parents because they will use it against you. \n\n4. Going to college out-of-state is difficult for people\u2019s mental health. If you\u2019re emotionally unprepared, find a college that is far enough but not too close from home, so your parents wouldn\u2019t pressure you to come home every weekend. At least two hours. \n\n5. I know it sucks that you\u2019re always working while trying to keep up with your academics, but it will help you in the long run. You\u2019ll be better mentally since you\u2019re free from your parents. You will learn time-management. You will grow and go out of your comfort zones. \n\n6. Keep finding part-time jobs as you go to school. Consistency apply for scholarships. \n\n7. Graduate. Find a job a few hours far away from your parents and only visit during holidays or whenever you feel like it.  Tell them you love them, but you\u2019re busy.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677944177.0},{"title":"Called the cops, physically beat my parents, and told them to die.

I am an only child, so I am the target of her anger.  Today I have a realization that she really doesn't like me. I borrowed her keys today and she was on a call so she didn't hear me say where I left her set of keys, she then called me frantically on my way to work to ask where it was and when I told her, her reply to me was \"fucking idiot\" and ended the call. I think it stuck with me because I could never imagine speaking to the people I love like that - the idea of saying that to my boyfriend or grandma etc a 'fucking idiot' despite how annoyed I was unsettling. I think I only feel that rage towards people I despise. I know this phrase seems kind of small but I think it just sat with me and made me think of the other signs pointing to the fact that she doesn't like me. She thinks my interests are an utter waste of time (sewing, baking, reading) and thinks I am an idiot because she will try to fight me on facts regarding my chosen career (quite technical and different to hers) and will conveniently be in a bad mood\/ upset with me when something nice happens to me that isn't her doing. \n\nWe live in a very westernized environment but if I make an attempt to change my appearance, mention living with a partner unmarried, don't serve my boyfriend like a 1950s maid or whatever her response is ' that's not what an (Asian) daughter is supposed to do'. I try to rationalize and point out that these ideas are antiquated and that people have most past this with our family being quite liberal, she accuses me of wanting to abandon our cultural ideals. Yes, I think we should abandon these sexist and limiting ideas but I by no means want to abandon my heritage!! I am so sick of her using the excuse that because we are POC I need to be subservient and docile. I should be an extrovert because I need to grow out of the fact that I am an introvert but I need to be silent around older people or men and do what they say, I need to be outgoing and social but indulging in activities normal people in their 20's like dating around or going to a bar\/club makes me a whore and just a bunch of other confusing expectations. \n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg but since I am venting let me add some additional info while I am at it. I have been saving up for a lovely holiday abroad but my therapist and my uncle have suggested that I use the money to move out asap. This was a big deal, especially from my Asian uncle because it's quite common here to still live with your parents until you get married. \n\nI know that if I leave she will drive my dad insane and I feel bad for him since he is quite reserved in comparison to her but he chose to stay with her. I feel conflicted because I know that if I live with my parents for any longer than I have to, I will end up dead. A few years ago, my maternal grandparents lived with us because they were in ill health and she resented having them there. My grandfather and a neurological disease and sometimes could do odd things that would get on her nerves but I remember him telling me one day in high school that my mother made him want to kill himself because of how worthless he made her feel. I never truly related - I knew she was harsh but she was never so harsh that I considered myself better off dead- until he passed and I became the target of her fury. I have since experienced a few instances of suicidal ideation that always came after a fight with her. She seems to pick me apart and make me feel like the scum of the earth. I have gotten myself into therapy and seen a psychiatrist so I am okay but I know that being in this environment is the biggest cause of my bad mental health. I fear that my dad will also feel this way if I am gone - she will just find someone else to victimize but I feel like I am waiting to leave to start living my life. \n\nI have really been trying to be nice and show her affection. I have asked her to go to lunch with me\/ get our nails done or go to a market since she enjoys that though she always seems to schedule other plans and blows me off. I try to sit down with her and talk since she says I don't tell her enough but it always ends up with her being on her phone messaging or taking a call for someone else or she doesn't listen to anything I say and instead starts picking me apart by pointing out that my hair looks frizzy that day or I have a pimple or she doesn't like my outfit etc. I cook her dinner and she has some comments like 'there's not enough pepper in it\", and \"I could have made it better\" but gets jealous if I cook something for my friends or partner and tells me stuff like \"Do they actually like this stuff\". I'll buy her a dress she mentioned wanting and she'll ask why I 'got that dress. it's ugly. It made me stop wanting to be around her or do nice things for her. It's also made me question if I fuck up everything I do for anyone but at least other people are politely lying to me then. \n\nI wish she was the one that was ill, her being in the hospital would be a nice break. It's horrible to say considering that she has provided for me financially. I feel like a terrible person because I know she's sacrificed so she could pay the bills yet the lack of kindness makes me resent her. I don't want her to know my children and I plan on emigrating as soon as I can. I don't want her to make my future family feel the way she made me feel or how she's made my grandparents, my uncle and my dad feel.

We live in NYC, where he pays more than $1500 in rent and I pay a little over $1000. I have found myself spending most of a given week at his place (he lives alone), and recently we have talked about me moving in when my lease is up this year, for these reasons:\n\n\\- Finances: We both have steady jobs but our current rents are straining our ability to get by\/save. Moving in together and splitting his rent would give us breathing room and help us save towards our respective goals: him for grad school, me for the manageable but lingering remainder of my student loans.\n\n\\- Life is good: I have been living with roommates ever since I came back to the US for college 6 years ago. My current roommates are solid, but I'm approaching my limit as someone who needs a lot of quiet and for certain common areas to be maintained fairly (I've had many headaches and spats about dishes, for example). My boyfriend is very much on the same wavelength as me in these areas: living with him for days at a time hasn't left either of us feeling lacking in personal space, and we've never had to tell each other to pick up slack with chores\u2014if anything, doing them for each other comes naturally and makes housework feel like a true team effort. I know this isn't the full picture and actually moving in would mean more adjustments, but I've never met anyone I click with so well, and who is as willing as he is to work together on the few areas where we don't.\n\nMy APs live in Korea and when I last visited I cautiously told my mom (54F) that a lot of my coworkers live with their SOs in the city. When I wondered out loud how much I could save if I did the same, she immediately said she would \"drag \\[me\\] back home\" if I ever tried it. The last difficult interaction I had with her about something like this was when she \"caught\" me (over the phone) at night at my ex's place a few years ago, and proceeded to slut-shame me and surveil me with phone calls for the next 2-3 days. So I know what I'm afraid of when I think about telling her I want to move in are mainly her concerns about sex.\n\nOther minor points are that my boyfriend is white and trying to pursue a higher degree in the arts. Currently, she seems happy about our relationship and to know that he's a caring and attentive partner. In the past, though, I've told her about his family and his college background, and she has used this info to scrutinize him, e.g. by comparing him to his \"more successful\" brother or asking what he's doing with his life now \"after going to a \\[prestigious\\] school like that.\"\n\nI see protectiveness confused with control here, and moving in is something I definitely want to tell her about directly before I do it. At the same time, it's scary to think about losing the support and sense of safety my parents have provided in times of crisis (I have no extended family here). I'd just like advice on how to tell them about this (should I also involve my dad, who's generally seemed a bit more lenient?) and on what to tell myself should they react negatively and\/or cut me off.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677823492.0},{"title":"Am I the only one who can barely feel stress at this point","author":"Worried_asf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11g7otp\/am_i_the_only_one_who_can_barely_feel_stress_at\/","text":"Being hyper stressed 24\/7 growing up has forced me to downright lose the ability to feel stress to survive.

Gibson. I really highly recommend it to anyone seeking to understand their difficult relationship with their parents - it had so many relatable and eye opening moments for me.\n\nBut one recurring thought I kept having while reading the book, especially when she's describing the traits of emotionally immature people, was \"This just sounds like your average (South) Asian parent\".\n\nFor context, here are some of the traits she covers:\n\n\\- Self-preoccupation\/egocentrism  \n\\- Low empathy and emotional insensitivity  \n\\- Lack of emotional self-awareness  \n\\- Disregard for boundaries  \n\\- Resisting emotional intimacy  \n\\- Poor communication  \n\\- An absence of self-reflection  \n\\- Refusal to repair relationship problems  \n\\- Emotional reactivity  \n\\- Problems sustaining emotional closeness  \n\\- Intolerance of differences or different points of view  \n\\- Being subjective rather than objective (what I feel matters more than what's actually happening)  \n\\- Difficulty regulating emotions or admitting to mistakes\n\nDoesn't it seem like these traits are just the norm amongst Asian parents, rather than the exception?\n\nThe book also covers how people become this way when they are emotionally shut down and underdeveloped as children. Thinking of how rigid and narrow Asian cultures tend to be in terms of what's considered acceptable, it's not surprising that many Asian people would learn to shut down their deepest feelings while growing up and to never explore or express themselves in a way that would help them develop a strong sense of self and individual identity. I often feel like all the Asian parents I know are the same person, meaning extremely conformist and similar in their thinking\/attitudes\/beliefs\/behaviours. Like there's only a handful of acceptable beliefs, opinions, attitudes and even jobs that these people can have - anything else will get you shunned. Maybe emotional underdevelopment is the inevitable consequence of growing up so rigidly and that can explain the widespread emotional immaturity amongst Asian parents.\n\nIt just shocks me how common this all is, almost like the entire continent of Asia is engaged in a massive cycle of generational trauma. Is it a step too far to say that Asian cultures are cultures full of bad ideas and practices, specifically regarding parenting and interpersonal relationships? What are the main differences between Asians and westerners here, who don't seem to have this problem on such a large scale? I know that the main reason why I'm not like my parents is that I was lucky enough to grow up in the west and be exposed to other ways of thinking and being. Why does it seem like these other ideas never reach or get through to Asian people on a large scale? Is everybody just mindlessly living the way their parents lived? So many questions\n\nEdit: Lots of people are mentioning how this isn't an Asian only issue and many western people also have emotionally immature family members. I completely agree and never meant to make it seem like it's completely one sided and all white people are emotionally mature. But I do believe the problem is worse in the east and many people in the comments have pointed out good reasons why. Ignorance around mental health and a culture that views vulnerability as a sign of weakness massively hinders any chance of emotional development through recognising unhealthy behaviours. A much greater cultural focus on obedience\/duty along with the common view of children as extensions of their parents (instead of independent beings with their own agency) can create entitled parents who expect a lot from their children even if they failed to provide for those children's emotional needs growing up. Unstable societies affected by colonialism and political unrest creates a culture that focuses on survival rather than feelings.

My adoptive parents were abusive my whole life so I decided to ghost them the moment I moved out. A few months later my biological mother tried to reach out to me and I was very unsure if I should step in contact with her. During that time I was also in a sensitive period in my life I was grieving the loss of parents, dealing with cptsd, starting a new job etc. \nEventually I decided to talk to her since she was persistent on trying to make sure if I was alright (she also shared her health problems with me, which she could overcome). That lead to my first heartfelt conversation with her and we talked about all the things that happened to me in my childhood. I\u2019m adopted so ofc there\u2019s still adoption trauma I\u2019m carrying around with me. I was vulnerable and desperate for a mother figure. Within a month of talking back and forth via WhatsApp (keep in mind my Thai is not the best) she started asking if I can lend her some money. Apparently she has been paying for her medical bills and it was time to pay off the loans for her house, otherwise they would take her car. At that time I was working a part time minimum wage job, but because she made it clear that it was urgent so she can keep up her job as a sales operation manager I went fine I\u2019ll loan you 500 bucks.\nTime went by my grandmother (my mothers mother & the only one I have left) fell ill. And again I sent her some money for the medical bills. I started saving up and last fall my partner and I decided to go on a vacation to Thailand so I could visit my family. My bio mom has a relatively new house in Bangkok and she insisted on us staying with her. First she said we can take her car and drive by ourselves but when it got down to it suddenly it was not safe enough for her so we didn\u2019t. My boyfriend and I were paying for gas cuz she was driving us to places and I was okay with paying for her food. BUT AT SOME POINT she would take my money out of my wallet to pay for her shit!!!!!!????? That was another red flag I missed and I ended up paying for all of her expenses the time I spent in Thailand. Not only that but she was mentioning my weight TO THE MOST RANDOM ASS PPL and saying shit like \u201e555 are u carrying a child to hide ur stomach\u201c. I once even heard her talking on the phone saying how she hopes my brother doesn\u2019t turn out like me (I don\u2019t look like a traditional Thai, red hair nose piercing). I was truly heartbroken when I heard that. Multiple times she told my little brother that I would pay for his students loan, if my bio dad forgets ab it. Heck I\u2019m 20 years old I never went to college. I was so fed up and crying hysterically, therefore my boyfriend booked us a flight to Krabi to get away from the bs. When we got back from that trip the morning after my bio mom received a letter which she opened immediately so I asked her what it said and she went \u201eoh it\u2019s just the government telling me to pay off my loans I haven\u2019t been paying this whole year\u201c. It was September. I sent her money for that matter in spring. What the actual fioajalale. At that point I just stopped giving a shit cuz we were about to fly home anyway. Weeks later we got back home and retrieved from that awful experience she hit me up with a call asking for 3k??!!!!? I said tf no and she went oh what about ur bf can he lend me that money? I said nO, hung up and never talked to her again. The time I was in contact with her I spent more money on her than she ever did on me\n+plus she gave me away as a child nor do I recall any memories of her raising me bc it was my grandma who took care of me back then.

I  took dance and acting classes at community college that I funded on my own. I auditioned, got some lead parts and commercials, and thrived within my acting community. \n\nBut my mom told me every day that actresses are whores, drug addicts, and homeless bums. She told me every day that I was stupid, fat, and ugly and no one would ever want to see Asians on stage. She constantly berated and tore me down, saying things like I\u2019m \u201cbetraying the family.\u201d \u201cNo one in our family does this.\u201d \u201cActing is for white people.\u201d And if I didn\u2019t \u201cget my act together and pursue a \u2018normal career\u2019 like (accounting or teaching), she can\u2019t die or rest easy.\u201d\n\nI am now 40, and yesterday she sent me a msg about a friend\u2019s son, whom she barely knows, who is talented in acting. She sent a wall text praising this random stranger. Oh, and could you get him a job?\u201d (I work in a media company but unfortunately doing something else not acting; my acting dreams died with my youth under her constant emotional blackmail).\n\nShe asked me, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you become an actress by now?\u201d\n\nI told her that she told me not to.\n\nShe said,\u201dI never said that. And if I did it was for your own good. If you failed to become something it\u2019s because you couldn\u2019t make it happen on your own.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cNow look at all these Asians on tv on Netflix. It\u2019s popular. Why did you give up? Why didn\u2019t you try harder?\u201d\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n*Update 1 - 03.01.2023:\nSo my mom's friend's son (that stranger) emailed me: \"I heard from my mom that your mom promised that you could refer me to a contact or a job at your company.\" (I said no such thing!) My mom doesn't even know what I do for a living. I only speak to her 2x a year only on holidays). He's also in a very different field of study from me, so I don't have any contacts in his field.) I don't know where the telephone pole broke: my mom's narcissism, his mom's potential narcissism, his own entitlement to my help...I feel bad for this stranger, potentially another victim of my mother's gaslighting. \n\nAny advice on how I should respond to him? (Should I tell him my mother is a narcissist and doesn't know anything about my work or what I do and I'm sorry she overpromised him and misled him? If I do, I know it'll get back to my mom, from his mom - my mom's Asian community is tight-knit.)\n\n*Update 2 - 03.02.2023\nThank you so much for all the responses! I didn't realize that while I registered my sadness at my mother's narcissistic gaslighting, I had a hard time and couldn't really \"connect to my anger.\" Reading your comments helped me see how downright enraged I feel. So it's been really healing to read all your comments - thank you! My younger self feels validated. While I started a dance class two months ago, some of your comments helped me to have the courage to try community acting again. (Thank you.

I am already 20 and as we know our past years have been severe. I was in my teenage was trying from from my highschool years to move out of the house, like to shift in a dorm but they won't allow  as they are afraid something would happen. I understand there concern for me being safe but the environment they are providing in the house is fucking unbearable for me and for my studies as a result I ruined it . I am a university student now, in which my parents forcefully admitted me. They obviously had so many options but they chose the one that I didn't like at all, only because its nearer than other universities and due to which I have to manage my studies, the 2 hours up down to university and come home to listen to their all complains everyday and in all of this mess they obviously want good grades not knowing what the fuck is their child going through. FYI I don't have my own room, I share it with my brother and sister. Whenever I bring up the topic of me wanting to shift to the dorm for a genuine intention to study, they start accusing by saying they know the wrong intentions why I want to go to the dorm for all the boys and stuff, they also bring the topic of how costly it is(Look I don't mind if they don't have the money but there's a whole story of why I think this thing doesn't matter). Then again when everything is calm they be like we understand why you want to go to dorm and we will also provide you money, but you can also stay at home, we want you in front of our eyes everyday, we don't wanna spoil you, it's okay if you don't score good, it doesn't bother us(but the fact it does bother them and me too). They have agreed of sending me to the dorm but it stil seem they are so unhappy and I really don't want that. They are not open to what they want from us. Even I can never open up to them about my feelings and whenever I did trusting my impulsive thoughts it turned out to be worse. One thing I know for sure is that my mental health is fucked up but I can't even go see a therapist because my parents won't allow. If you read this far I just want to know how to live with my parents and not to make them unhappy. I literally cry every fucking day in my bathroom and they don't even know and I always get this suicidal thoughts that if I won't be there then that would do good to them. I just want to let them know (which I already did) that I am trying but it's not happening and now I don't much more do I need to convince them. And the fact that they don't even trust their own child like I am a fucking slut or something (which in fact I never did anything at all that would bring down their reputation and will never do). They are just like they would love you for a moment like you are mean to them but just for a moment. Countless time I tried to talk to them, made them understand but nothing worked and its just getting worse. My mom asks if I have ever asked my dad how is it going in his life , I am like \" Bro he never even talks to me like a friend, he never asks me how is it going in my life neither do you ask me\" and she be like you always think about yourself. The emotional blackmail they do is incomparable. My mom be like you know how much I suffered, if you would have been there then what would have you even done. Also during fights she even says, \"May god give you a guy who will show you your place\" , yeah thats what I would like to hear when I am saying her complete different thing and she brings up the topic out of nowhere. Nothing to say about my dad he is there but he isn't. And I am done. Please you guys out there if there is a way to escape this environment rather than unaliving myself then please let me know. Yeah I don't have friends to talk all these about, this is my first time opening up to someone. Please if you can show me the right way I would appreciate.

My strict asian (desi) parents won't buy me a phone and my dad said he will buy me one when i am 18 (I will be 18 at the end of senior year in hs). They also won't let me get my permit. I'm not allowed to facetime or call friends without permission, and I have parental controls on everything. The wifi goes out at 10pm weekly and sometimes when my dad gets mad, he just randomly turns off the Wifi.\n\nfor example, last week he got mad at me for using my friend's wifi (with permission) to complete homework at 11pm. i told him at 10 pm to please extend the wifi bc I had homework (I'm taking 3 AP classes and have all A's) and he refused, saying I should do it the next morning. I told him multiple times it was due at 11:59 pm that night, and homework accounts for 15% of the grade so I had to complete it that night. After finding me doing hw in the night, he installed more parental controls and now I have 10 minutes limit for iMessage, FaceTime, and other social media.\n\nSo what annoys me the most though, is not having a phone. I always feel so embarrassed and when ppl ask me, I say my phone is dead or it broke. My parents offered to buy me a flip phone but I refused as it's too embarrassing and I would get bullied. Their reasoning is that in 1980's, they didn't need a phone growing up and they didn't have wifi nor technology and studied fine, so I should also be fine. It's also very hard for me as I do research, sports, etc... and I can never call them to let them know where I am. One time I was waiting in the rain for my mom who only came 2 hours later. I know I can ask my friends to borrow their phone but it's just embarrassing for me considering Im 15 years old. I'm not also allowed to close the door of my room or have any electronics. They think Im going to get addicted to my phone which is their other reason.\n\nI also can't buy a phone on my own. I definitely have the money to do so, but they keep my money locked up in a suitcase and Idk the code.\n\nI really need some help. Pls give me advice.

Your AP KNOWS what they are doing is bad. The fact that they can keep a mask on outside while carrying out abuse behind closed doors shows that they are perfectly capable of distinguishing the two behaviors. They also wouldn't love-bomb you if they couldn't distinguish. They choose to do the former bc they want to.\n2. Your AP does not WANT to see you succeed. This might be tough to swallow at first, but, have you noticed that the glass ceiling is always being raised higher? Even then, when they stir up chaos, drama, and hurt you (knowing perfectly well what they are doing) and try to \"control you\" in ways that actually backfire, doesn't it actually cause you fail? If your AP is a malignant narcissist, chances are, they are probably doing that on purpose to sabotage you. Nothing feeds a malignant narc's sadism more than seeing you \"try to do well\" to win their love\/approval and then sabotaging you so that you \"fail\" to do so. Your emotional pain gives them narcissistic supply. If you reveal a passion to them, chances are, they WILL sabotage it. Again, nothing gives a malig narc more sadistic joy than to steal your joy.\n3. The last tough pill to swallow is that when they argue, they aren't actually trying to reach a resolution with you. Normal, healthy ppl argue to reach a resolution. However, for a malig narc, what they're looking for is chaos and drama. Seeing you emotionally dysregulated gives them narcissistic supply.\n\nThis was tough for me to swallow, as someone raised by a single malig narc AM, with generational abuse and a malig narc family on her entire side (money squandering, drinking issues, etc) and a borderline + sociopathic cousin (who literally committed a crime before). But you realize that they won't change and simply chose to be this way. You don't fall for them playing victim, if you know that they are AWARE of what they are doing. If you knew this, you would RUN instead of \"working it out\".\n\nI still believe that there's more good in the world, and I was just \"raised\" by bad people.

By the age of 8, I was already raising myself without them. I cooked my own food, I starved if there was no food, I had zero help with my schooling and any life skills in general. I was put to cashier work by the age of 10, only knowing how to push buttons on the register and was forced to learn how to troubleshoot thousands of complaints during rush hour without their help at the age of 10. My compensation for years of work? Less than a week's worth of food. Logic would've meant a monthly allowance at least. But no, not even, my parents were too cheap for that.\n\nNow as a 30 yr old adult, they're expecting me to teach them EVERYTHING in life. My parents have lived and done business in the USA for 40+ years. They had MORE than enough time to learn the fundamentals of American business and its guidelines, but oh no! \"The Asian way is the RIGHT way\" they say. One can't just bring a Communistic approach to a Democratic world and expect it to sit well with the residing crowd. Like total WTF. WHO DOES THAT. I know people from other cultures, Mexicans for example, that come to America and completely merge with societal standards. Some even come here with zero English skills, and within 3 months time, without them even going to college, etc., they have WAY better English than my AM who's been here for 40+ years. That's calling having BRAINS, which I feel like APs like my own don't \"lack\" (so to speak) more like they're just TOO LAZY to use their brains. And yes, I'm calling them out for their laziness! Using their hands to work does NOT mean they're \"hardworking\" in my dictionary. They can be sweeping the SAME spot for 12 hours a day, when it's NOT even necessary, then completely lazy out the technical side of the job, which composes of 80% of the job, while the \"floor sweeping\" composes of just 5%. The point is using brainpower is a MUCH more difficult task for them, so they rather go the \"easy\" way out and do the repetitive job (sweeping floors), which interprets as laziness! Then they expect their children to sacrifice their schooling, meal breaks, career and relationships for THEIR lives, when they barely compensated us enough for, which is just selfish!\n\nTeaching them adult things (which ironically should be the other way around) is a futile task. Just the other night I was teaching my mom how to use her online bank account. This is the first time in her life she ever learned how to access her online account. Literally all it is, is inputting the username and password onto the site, then clicking the \"Login\" button. It took her over TWO HOURS just to figure out how to do it, and she still doesn't understand. She repeated the same steps 20+ times, and it was STILL hard for her to get it.

Don't get me wrong here, I am so grateful I even have this option and I count myself lucky I don't have to worry about rent for now while I look for new roles. However, it's been four months since I moved back in with them and I feel like each day reminds me why I chose to live independent from them after college. I don't exactly have a great relationship with my Dad (lol like the rest of the world) for reasons I wish I don't remember, but I have to remind myself that living with my parents is better than risking being unhoused.   \n\n\n**then**\n\nFor context, my family and I immigrated here in the early 2000's and it was an intense experience starting from somewhat nothing. I recall our first apartment: we slept on stacked comforters, used an ironing board as a dining table, and just laid on bath towels out in the living room while watching whatever the antenna caught that day. We definitely didn't have much, but somehow I felt unbothered because I knew we were still new. I remember the times we were able to afford our first dining set (from goodwill) and my dad eventually got cable so my brother and I wouldn't be so bored. \n\nAfter a short while, my family could not afford to live in this 2bd 2bath anymore, so temporarily chose to move into a garage turned studio. With the four of us cramped, I truly thought I was going to lose my mind. Our relatives tried to help us and gave some old mattresses, towels, bedding, kitchen utensils, toiletries, even some old toys, books, and dvd's for my brother and I. In the three months we lived in this studio, I already saw a stockpile forming in a corner hidden by a divider. It wasn't bad yet and I could disregard it for the time being because we were literally living in four walls and nowhere to put anything. \n\nAfter this time, we eventually upgraded to a 3 bdrm townhouse and I felt so happy I finally was able to have my own room (never really experienced this before, I've always had to share a room). This is the moment I thought we were actually ok. We had one couch, everyone had their own bed, one tv, a study table, and a computer corner. To me, this felt like the most balanced moment in my time so far in America and it was just a year in (yes, moved three times in a year). \n\nThings were going well, until I noticed our cutlery drawer had enough spoon and forks for like 20 people. I noticed so many mismatched dishes and cups (from purchases and donations) that didn't need to be there. We had a cabinet dedicated to plastic bags, so that caused a lot of random things to linger on the kitchen counters. My parents didn't want to throw away old dish sponges because they said that can be used to clean the sink, amongst other things. Our fridge began to be a storage closet for sauces with no expiry, our pantry stocked with enough canned food for an infantry, and our hallway closet stacked with old shoes that didn't even fit most of us anymore, a weird amount of umbrellas, two vacuums (one broken that my dad insists he can get fixed to sell), the list goes on. \n\nMy parents couldn't afford to stay in this townhouse anymore, so we moved to a 2bdrm again. This cycle repeated itself within 7 years, moving back and forth from 3 to 2 to 3 to 2. When we moved into a 2 bdrm again, I thought it would make sense for my parents to let go of things we didn't need anymore. However, they always tried to justify keeping things by saying \"***we can send this back to the Philippines.***\"\n\nThis phrase will forever be my mom's favorite scapegoat whenever I try to suggest donating piles of clothes to goodwill. It's not just clothes. It's other appliances that are partially broken, tupperware  through the 2000's, kitchen utensils, dishes, cups, bedding, BATH TOWELS (sorry, it was at this moment I just remembered a cabinet just filled probably 30 bath towels..), bath products, random gadgets (mostly for weight loss purposes), old bedding, old pillows (counted recently, there's about 40 pillows.. we have like 3 heads we'd be kissing the ceiling with these stacks?!), curtains, an old TV, old ironing boards, ugh... more.. just so much more. \n\n**now**\n\nI lived independently from my parents since I was 20 for college, then lived with them again for about a year after I graduated to which I had to sleep in the living room because there was no space. When I was offered my first full-time job, I decided to just take it even though it wasn't exactly *the job*. But it was a job that offered me sanity, a means to have even just a room of my own so I went with it. I felt like I could finally fix my room up the way I wanted to without much clutter. I tried to keep things that only made sense because I didn't want to deal with that anymore. I did feel guilty that I couldn't help them. Even though I tried to clean, things somehow refilled the spaces. I lived away from them for a few years, until I lost my job. I lost a means to this sanctuary I created to feel safe, somewhat happy, and at peace. \n\nWhen I moved back with my parents, I was grateful this time it was a 2 bedroom home and I didn't have to sleep in the living room. But with my brother away, the 2nd bedroom became a storage room along with the closet. Piled with boxes full of broken machines, plastic storage boxes filled with clothes sized for 5 and up that could've helped a couple generations in the Philippines by now, and a treadmill that is begging to be stepped on since 2008. \n\n**the struggle**\n\nWhenever I try to bring up that I'd like to purchase *balikbayan boxes* (boxes you send back home filled with whatever you want) to help my mom with her mission to send these clothes\/things back to the Philippines, she insists she wants to handpick the items. However, the same reason is provided each request was made: \"I just don't have the time.\" She works hard, sometimes too hard for her age, but I understand why she does and needs to. I offer my services and tell her I can take photos and send them to her while I organize it, but she ends up feeling frustrated and gets angry with me, tells me to drop the subject. I have my moments where I simply can't handle it. To this day, I have my clothes still sitting in laundry baskets because there's no room in the bedroom closet. I have uhaul boxes with my things because cabinets are prioritized for plastic bags and tupperware. I could rent a storage but I am flat broke. \n\nThere's old boxes here that have pens, old make up, random knick-knacks that my mom doesn't have time to rummage through because of her work. I'm not blaming her and I understand her mentality of subconsciously hoarding. We had nothing and now there's excess of things that don't add value to our everyday lives, at least to me. My mom would rather all these things take space than be donated to randoms because she knows so much more people in the Philippines who could benefit from it. It's just that, the things are and have been here since 2005. \n\nI was in the middle of cleaning, but I realized I needed to take a break and I felt like I was about to burst out either screaming, crying, or just violently punching couch pillows to let go of this steam. Whenever I try to clean, I try to toss things that to me, is garbage, but to my mom, something that can be useful *mamaya* (later.) She gets mad at me if I toss used paper towels (she leaves them out to dry so she can use them again), or if I toss take-out condiments (we literally have the same sauces in the fridge), or throw out expired food (expiration dates aren't real, which sure can be applied to most, but maybe not meat and\/or dairy?) \n\nI'm not sure what to do. Hoarding is one of the many issues I have to deal with when it comes to my parents. I don't even know where to start when it comes to financial responsibilities. I sometimes feel jealous of others when their parents, who immigrated here as well, didn't have to share the same struggles. Somehow, their parents went on to have better paying jobs while my dad stuck with two minimum wage jobs and worked 80 hours a week for almost ten years.. My mom, who has had the same salary in the last decade because she didn't think she was qualified to earn more.. We've always had debt, there's always financial struggle, and I feel like we've been stuck in this poverty loop and I don't know what to do. I feel the need to work harder and earn more to get us out of this hole, but I'm honestly also mentally shot. I have PTSD, I've carried some level of hoarding and fiscal irresponsibility because I sadly didn't fall too far from the tree, but I'm trying to actively work on it myself. \n\nI'm exhausted, I'm frustrated, I feel stuck, and I just wish that we could at least come together and tackle one thing within our control and it's the hoarding. We may not be able to save ourselves from mountains of debt, but we could at least do the little things for our health and sanity. There are just days where I stare at our stockpile of things, trash even, and I feel like I want to give up. I feel like there's nothing I can do or say to change this reality, and I feel like I don't have the strength to even pull myself up because then the guilt of even doing somewhat better than my parents, eats me alive. When I got a new job and made more than my parents, I felt like shit. I felt like shit that I was just trying to escape them when all my mom has done for me is love me, provide for me, and I know she's doing the best that she can, but I hold so much anger, frustration, and resentment sometimes. \n\nGod. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I can't afford a therapist, I don't have health insurance at the moment, and I just felt like crying into the void. I hope this is temporary, I need to believe this is temporary because this has been my permanence for the last twenty years.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677457217.0},{"title":"AP's have a serious lack of EQ","author":"A_Flying_Su47","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11coseg\/aps_have_a_serious_lack_of_eq\/","text":"For parents that claim to be so loving and caring about their kids they sure as hell don't know how to interact with them.

Lack of empathy is probably one of the biggest risk factors for abusive behavior.**\n   * Examples of abusive\/bullying\/manipulative\/toxic behaviors, and how to prevent\/respond to them\n   * Positive discipline strategies, talk about difference between discipline and punishment\n   * How to handle personal mental health issues like stress, anxiety, past trauma, etc.\n      * **Special focus on self-esteem.** **Unfortunately, a lot of abusive adults out there take their own low self-esteem out upon innocent children.

Living in the 4th largest city in China(Shenzhen), my mom is a housewife. My dad is a driving instructor and he\u2019s income would have to support our entire family. \n\nDuring my college years, he got into silver trading(online, also probably a scam)and lost all of our money. I never graduate university cuz we wouldn\u2019t be able to pay the tuition and student loan is not really a thing in China.\nCame to the US was really just a school program for me. I have never thought or planned that one day I would come to the US and then stayed. I stayed because my mom\u201dforced\u201dme to. One of my uncle\u2019s friend opened a massage parlor in Texas and he seems to live a comfy life. So my AP have never been to the US. They thought maybe somehow, even without any help or any relatives in the US, I could be just as successful\u2014\u2014While I was crying on the phone and telling them that I want to go back to China, my mom literally blamed me that I am not cherishing this opportunity and this chance to be \u201csuccessful\u201d. Successful how? By never finish Uni and working in a restaurant and being sexually verbally harassed by man for a five dollars tip?\n\nAnyway, the first several year was hard. Couldn\u2019t afford to go to school,  couldn\u2019t find any decent job and was stucked in a toxic relationship with a man that I don\u2019t even love. It was my first relationship too, it just screw me up so deeply. I don\u2019t believe in man or love or marriage now. I would have nightmares because of this man. I went to court just to get rid of him in 2019 too. My mom knew that guy wasn\u2019t right for me. He has a gambling addiction, but no one loves me at that time and I was just yearn for care and attention. I moved in with him cuz I am sick and tired of sleeping in the basement. Deep down in my AP\u2019s gut they knew it was all wrong. But yet they let me. One bad choice after another. And one day, it\u2019s almost like, faith had slapped me on my face and yelled at my ears, \u201cwhat have you done!\u201d. It was just woke up. I finally started to observe myself and my life and found that how many bad choices that I made and how stupid I was.\n\nThen I finally managed to get myself out of all that in later 2019. When I finally got my green card and started to feel like there\u2019s a fighting chance in my life\u2014-covid came. Suddenly, my AP said they needed help, which I already \u201chelped\u201d them many times before. Every time my mom demanded whatever the maximum that I can transfer thru western union, like 2500usd. Every time I feel like I am their cash cow. They would just stopping working, with all the excuses cuz they know that I will send them money if they demanded it. I worked 3 jobs total in this year. One of my work is waitressing, I stand and running around all day without healthcare or day offs. They knew what I did for work and they had no shame of demanding money from me. They often say \u201cI am so proud of you\u201d\u2014-sounds like such an irony for me.\n\nFast forward till today, I finally work in an American cooperate just like any other millennials. I always dreamed about going to school(I never could)and have an American degree(tbh, a MBA) I never buy any luxury products nor splurge. Cuz I am just so afraid of being broke.

While he does absolutely nothing to be successful, or to be a dad that I could look up to. Nothing. It was such a pain to even talk to them. \n\nNow that I am settled in the US(still single with no S\/O) and they told me that they are looking forward to come to the US and live with me. Just by thinking of it, it gives me this chill on my spine. I honestly do not wants to live with them. I can\u2019t imagine them being in here. \n\nSafe to say that I do not miss them in my life. I came back to China at the end of 2021 for work(sponsored by the company I worked for)and met them again, and I am just not thrilled to see them after 8 years. I am not comfortable laying down in the same bed with my mom. I couldn\u2019t sleep and is often wake up at night. They keep telling me how much they missed me. I almost bursted out the words \u201cis it me or the money\u201d. They are my parents but now, I would just resent them for all of the miserable things happened in my life.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677375510.0},{"title":"how do u get away with going on trip without telling ur parents?","author":"zdawg123456","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11cq9n6\/how_do_u_get_away_with_going_on_trip_without\/","text":"\nbooked a trip to mexico and it\u2019s going to be during the school week, live on campus without my parents. it\u2019s only a 3 day trip but i just wanted some tips to make sure i don\u2019t get caught. i have life 360 but i\u2019m just going to login with my roomates phone whose not going. i was thinking is there any way they would know by t-mobile? does the owner of your plan get notified when someone leaves the country? i have 5 gb free so i was planning just to use that. the time difference is the same so i was just going to call my parents maybe 1-2 during the trip, and act like everything is normal.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677439872.0},{"title":"Is it bad that i want my parents to die?","author":"d_ebo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11c3ozv\/is_it_bad_that_i_want_my_parents_to_die\/","text":"lol","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677380574.0},{"title":"That one monthly discussion.","author":"Inmyhumbleopinion24","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11cpm36\/that_one_monthly_discussion\/","text":"Today was the worst of the annual two month explosion that happens with my parents.

From teenagehood to early twenties, they were strict about going out. Typical of Asian parents, they want us to study, study, study, and be unquestionably obedient to them. Now, I have the last laugh. My mother no longer fawns about her idealised perfect Asian kid, who is her coworker's son. That kid is unquestionably obedient, just goes from school to home, stays home on weekends and have part time job of babysitting. But my mother only hears about that kid from her coworker's pov. I personally have met the guy, and he is really shy and meek. Like myself, he had difficulty finding work after graduating college and I can only guess that he is too shy at interviews, like I had been before. My mother no longer brings him up as the shining example of the perfect Asian kid. \n\nAdditionally, without much hint, my parents don't whinge anymore about going out on nights. They brought with them the mentality from Philippines that night outs are like in Mad Max, where stabbing, fu*king, and drugs are rampant. But we're not in lawless and corrupt Philippines, and night outs where I am are actually okay for the most part and the concerns are wildly exaggerated. Most people don't pressure you to drink beyond your limit (which is probably not the case in Philippines). Although, I think my parents are far more concerned about the possibility of any us going on casual sex as they are religious, albeit liberal by Asian standards. But I digress, and now my parents don't really say anything anymore about going out. Maybe me moving out to a new city have made my parents loosened up. My younger brother still lives at home, but I heard he went out one night with his workmates and came home eight in the morning. My parents did not say anything. Like, only now they don't say anything now that we're in late twentys? Maybe they tolerate night outs with coworkers but not with friends especially when we were younger.\n\nFinally, I have to say I have schadenfreude when my father finally admitted that he and my mother were wrong for not letting us work, even jobs \"beneath us\". They admitted that they should have let us work before to develop work ethic, which they deprive us of growing up. My mother could not figure out before why I wasn't able to find a job.

Sometimes my dad YELLS at me to help my mom because she is always in the kitchen all day or working around the house. It takes forever. I would be in the kitchen all day all the time. My mom is literally always in the kitchen making one thing or another. She doesn\u2019t cook for me, I make my own food but she cooks for my dad and brothers and her in laws when they visit sometimes. \n\nI noticed it takes forever. When I make salan or any Pakistani dishes I am done in like 1-2 hours and that\u2019s it for the whole day. She is always in the kitchen and it takes forever making the same dish or sometimes multiple dishes. If I help, she would find another recipe to make while I am making food so it doesn\u2019t cut down in the time because she just finds another recipe to make while I am in the kitchen with her. \n\nI would have to be sitting home all day waiting hand and foot for my brothers and dad to be hungry so I can go in the kitchen and make them their egg sandwich or shrimp tacos or whatever they\u2019re feeling like eating that day. Oh and get comments about \u201cI want a new recipe\u201d. My brother literally suggested I make cookies at home or brownies that I \u201calways used to make\u201d. Like am I suppose to do this for you? Are you asking me to make food as if I am a chef or something? \n\nI feel like I am a bit of a selfish brat because I don\u2019t help my mom in the kitchen at all. I get kind of irritated when she is in the kitchen AGAIN because I know my dad is going to be side eyeing me because I don\u2019t help. Kind of similar to how my brothers get slightly annoyed when my dad is always doing some work around the house because it makes them look lazy. \n\nIt\u2019s literally the same thing every day. Do you think if my family has a social life my mom wouldn\u2019t be in the kitchen so much? Like they would go to their families houses for gatherings and eat there and bring home leftovers and we can eat that the next day and also if my brothers had friends they would eat out with them sometimes so they won\u2019t have to eat at home. I feel like everyone says they\u2019re mom is always coping and working around the house but I swear to god nobody lives the way we do and the issue is because we are sos socially isolated and just sit home wanting to eat eat eat all the time.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677353930.0},{"title":"Have you ever tried to limit your parents\u2019 influence over you?

He was absolutely manic. \n\nI ended up convincing him to get help so he wouldn\u2019t commit another crime and cost my parents another 25k for a lawyer. I was driving around trying to save him while I was 7 months pregnant. I was so stressed I couldn\u2019t eat. My daughters were 4 and 2 years old then. \n\nAnyways\u2026 the point of my story is\u2026 my parents have used me and my daughters as fillers of his void. When I had stated clearly I will not allow them to use my kids has his temporary happiness. I would have one weekend with my parents and brother and the next weekend with my husbands parents to be fair. And that way no one felt like they got less time with the kids. \n\nFor a year and half I gave him many weekends, and even before that I gave him 10+ years of bailing him out. \n\nNow my parents are blaming me for being tough on him and not forgiving him. When all they do is enable him and he gets everything he wants. He has to work for nothing. Jordan\u2019s. A new car. 24kt gold. Meanwhile I worry about their dollar, they blow it on him. \n\nThey asked me today when would I be ready to see him again. Prior to him coming home I set up some parental controls to help my parents. But now they resent me bc I can see clearly everything they are letting him get away with. And if they could lie for him they would and they are. I feel horrible bc I love my parents. But what they want me to do, puts my kids in jeopardy as he doesn\u2019t take no well. And has lashed out physically many times. So I know setting a boundary for my kids, they will overstep. \n\nI\u2019m hurt and don\u2019t know what to do bc I work at the nail salon with my mom. She helps me so much, we live in one of their properties but lately now that I\u2019ve distanced myself from being my brothers keeper, I know she resents me and tries to manipulate me into letting him see my kids. \n\nWhen we are at work when she is mad at me, she will let me struggle in front of everyone because she looks out for me when we aren\u2019t in disagreement. But everyone knows at work and can sense it. When we get along she helps me and cares for me. I\u2019m only treated poorly when I don\u2019t do what she wants or tell her what she wants to hear. \n\nThey are using money they help my husband and I with right now to use it as leverage and guilt. When in all reality, even when my brother was seeing my kids, or we FaceTimed everyday, slowly I could see him being high as a kite on the phone calls. Or he\u2019d have to leave my house to let the dog out (go home and smoke). \n\nIm just torn that I see how my parents and him manipulated me. And how they treat me now that I won\u2019t allow it. \n\nI don\u2019t want to cut my parents out of the kids lives  but since I don\u2019t talk to him no more, my parents only talk to me on the phone when they are on the way home and he\u2019s not around. I can\u2019t call and talk to her anymore bc she doesn\u2019t want him to be hurt since I haven\u2019t forgiven him yet. \n\nSo our relationship tip toes around him. If he doesn\u2019t get his way, the will sacrifice there time with the kids and act like they want to wait until we can all do it together. It corners me in guilt bc I  love them but I refuse to enable and put my kids and husbands safety before someone who has made poor choices my entire life and had no repercussions on the family end. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore but I do know the way they are treating me is wrong","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677223719.0},{"title":"Fake friends","author":"Wilmaaaaa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11a65jh\/fake_friends\/","text":"Does your AP say your friends are fake and they they just want to show off?

So to start, while having provided me and my sister with the best possible conditions growing up, my parents weren't always the most non-problematic people. My dad can be physically violent towards us whenever things don't go his way, and my mom can be emotionally manipulative in retaliation to his behaviors. That being said, they've been together for over 20 years now and have always had great expectations for both me and my sister.\n\nAs the eldest, firstborn son, I've always been viewed as the golden child who's expected to follow the life plan that they've drawn up for me. I was going to have the perfect life with a nuclear family that's going to keep the family tree going even across the seas. Here's the kicker: I'm gay. That tree is f\\*cked. How do I know my parents aren't ok with this? Because when I was 16, they broke into my room when I wasn't there, looked through the search history on my laptop, confirmed what they were looking for, and sent me to a conversion therapy camp for the summer.\n\nIt's been about 6 years since that summer, and while my parents think that I'm \"fixed\", I am in fact not. Not a day goes by where I don't think about how I'm going to keep up this lie to them and yet somehow gain the courage to one day say what I actually think to them, even if it's from literally halfway across the world. It was bearable for the first few years of college seeing as I can just avoid their check-in calls if the idea of talking to them was too much to handle. But as I'm approaching my graduation date, the avoidance period keeps getting longer and longer. It's gotten to the point where they asked my sister to text me that we're having a family meeting soon since they know I won't pick up the phone (probably to say that I'm too Americanized, ungrateful, or just some new inventive way to make me feel like I've disappointed them yet again).\n\nI won't lie, I'm not going to win any \"Best Son\" awards anytime soon. My attitude towards them lately is bordering the line of neglect, but what am I supposed to do? My options are: come out to them properly and have them disown me, distance myself and go no contact with them, or keep up this lie until god knows when. It feels like I'm losing a part of myself whichever option I end up choosing and I'm stuck in these \"In-Betweens.\" In between my happiness and my family's, in between the U.S. and my home country, in between my college life and my adult life, etc. I just don't know what to do.

I've already lashed out a few times on days where I had low mood and my dad does NOT take negative emotions or feelings well at ALL. We also don't talk about our feelings in this house, and we certainly don't resolve problems with words...\n\nBasically, my sister and I are both unemployed after graduating, and living with our parents (the worst thing you could do to asian parents LOL). Covid times really fucked up my mental health, but I'm trying to get back on my feet now, which has been hard because I've been out of work for so long and I lack a lot of self-confidence because of it.\n\nSo the reason I could survive so long without a job is because I'm living with my parents and also because I worked during school and had student loans and grants to help me. So I've been living very frugally off my savings, but I also still like to enjoy and treat myself every once in a while because if I didn't, I'd probably kill myself.\n\nAnyways, last year I started realizing that I give more than I receive in life, and especially in the case with my sister. I've always valued my family and tried to do things for them to show my appreciation and also to ease the burden of my parents. Many times, I'd offer to pick up groceries from the asian supermarket in the next town over when I was in the area because we don't live near there so they don't go often. A lot of times, I would even pay with my own money. I have NEVER asked my parents for money or to pay me back for something. Sure, sometimes I'd go grocery shopping with them and they'd pay, but in my entire life, I've never asked them to give me money. I even paid for my own 4 years of post-graduate schooling.\n\nAs for my sister, I feel like she's the one who gets spoiled by the family and she also doesn't seem to think the way I do about supporting family. She's also very cheap and stingy about what she does with her money. And my mom is always going on about how I'm the older sister and I need to take care of her. Now that I'm older, this just sounds to me like some bullshit way for me to just keep getting taken advantage of. \n\nSo this is where all the resentment comes in. I feel like I've sunk so much money into paying for shit for my sister (and giving her my old things, some of which were expensive and I could have just sold), but she doesn't do the same for me. I can probably count on my fingers how many times she ever bought me something or paid me back for something. I also have been kicking myself because the times that I did pay, it's not like she asked for it and it was of my own will, so I can't really blame her when it was my own doing. For example, I'd pick up boba for my family because I always felt bad if I came home with just one for myself, and it made them excited which made me happy. But it started adding up, especially when it's like $30 each run.\n\nHonestly, I don't mind buying things for my parents because I live in their house and they buy groceries, but it's the fact that my sister counts as an extension of them even though she doesn't pay for anything. My dad literally told me today that the \"rule in this house\" is that if I don't want to share what I buy with everyone, then don't buy it. He said this once before when I found out my sister went into my room and helped herself to the wine that was on my desk (without even asking or telling me). That's the part that bothers me, when people don't ASK to use my things. If anyone ever asked, I'd say \"sure\" but no one ever ASKS, and apparently they shouldn't need to.\n\nSo now that I've realized the source of what's stressing me out, I'm starting to put my foot down and set boundaries so that I don't have to keep feeling resentful, like putting my name on the food\/snacks that I buy so that my sister knows I paid for it, not our parents (this makes me feel very petty and something you'd do with roommates but idk what else to do lol, and when I confronted her about her eating my stuff before, she told me that if I didn't want her to eat it, then put my name on it). \n\nBut my family doesn't like that, and I'm starting to get a lot of backlash for it. It's been making me very depressed because I feel so alone in this family and I don't feel understood or appreciated at all. It's also slowly degrading my relationship with my sister, who I used to be very close to. I guess now that I'm starting to stand up for myself and not be a pushover, it's making them more uncomfortable and they can't deal with that?\n\nI tried to talk to my mom about it, but she told me that I need to get a job and start saving to move out and get my own place because it seems like I can't live with anyone. I KNOW that moving out will solve my problems, but I can't financially right now, which makes me even more depressed, especially for every job that doesn't call me back. I just feel so stuck.\n\nI'm looking for advice and tips from your own experience, but also just some moral support I guess. I always feel bad about myself for having these thoughts since I feel like I'm being selfish or a bad person, and feel like everything is always my fault. :')\n\n**TLDR;** how do you go about talking and setting financial boundaries when living with your parents and sibling(s) without ruining your relationship with them, especially when your sibling doesn't contribute to the family financially and often benefits from your own contribution?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677181982.0},{"title":"I'm scared to tell my mom I want to go to the US for my bday","author":"Shaboomshabam","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/11agsbw\/im_scared_to_tell_my_mom_i_want_to_go_to_the_us\/","text":"Im scared to let my mom know im going to the US for a week around my bday...

My aunt\u2019s has two children. One older son and one younger daughter. Both of them are in their mid 30s to late 30s, and as of now my sister cousin is the only one who is married. She rarely contacts my aunt, despite being her daughter, and I can clearly see why.\n\nMy sister cousin has been a victim of gender favoritism throughout her entire life. My aunt only makes her cook and do chores, letting my brother cousin have his free time. My aunt tells my sister cousin that houseworks are women\u2019s part, not mens. Whenever my cousins fight, even the times that it was clearly the brother\u2019s fault, my sister cousin always get punished no matter what and told that she has to accept it because she is a girl.

It went on and on with no end in sight, i did not get nearly enough time to rest, and worst of all my mom would hurl all kinds of insults at me every time I made a mistake or lost focus. \n\nSome of the uglier things she has said were that I must have been born to torment her and take her energy from more important things, that I was worthless compared to everyone else, that god was on her side and not mine, and that I looked so ugly when I was crying that I deserved to be sent to hell. \n\nStudying was constant and neverending, no matter what we were doing. My mom would slip in test questions during walks or teach me more math in the elevator after a long day. Even though I never got any breaks lasting longer than a day except when my family visited, it was the fact that studying was always in the background that made life so much more exhausting. It wasn\u2019t normal studying either, It was the brain of a 10ish year old being stuffed full eith calculus and loads of other shit. \n\nEven though that\u2019s when the more overt stuff started, my mom started making me feel constantly on edge, insecure and nervous way before that. She drilled the idea that something was inherently wrong with my personality into me since I was like 3 years old. \n\nApparently she thought I was so problematic because I refused to acknowledge and learn from my mistakes. I still remember the time she made 5 year old me figure out how to open a new bottle of pesticide, and when I kept messing up she got madder and madder, insisting that I wasn\u2019t trying, that I was stupid, that I would be able to do it if I let go of my problematic personality. I remember first begging for forgiveness and a second chance as early as when I was 5 or 6.\n\nMy mom also constantly talked crap about essentially everyone I knew, except some family members. As far as I remember, most of it was justified, but maybe that\u2019s because I was too young to understand what she was really saying. This made me believe deeply that my mom was absolutely correct about everything, because she was just so confident and so right. I didn\u2019t have a lot to back that belief up, but it just felt right. For years I\u2019d feel this sense of guilt for daring to think I truly knew anything better than my mom.\n\nA side effect of her constant shit talking was that I started thinking I was superior to most people as well, simply because they didn\u2019t have my moms approval. \n\nI developed a somewhat snobbish personality and was bullied at school for it, which made me even more miserable. I was torn between trying to suck up to my bullies and standing up for myself(which my mom suggested I do). I ended up alternating between both, but what ultimately restored my reputation was learning to be normal again and fixing my personality on the outside. Even now, my mom says that everything would be better if only I had listened to her back then. Jeez thanks, I already feel bad enough about it. Then there\u2019s her insufferable attitude when I propose talking these things out, even when I explain it does mean a lot to me. \n\nShe also makes snide remarks about my body constantly, calling me fat (I weigh 48 kilograms). She also (unsuccessfully) tried pressuring me into getting cosmetic surgery. On Top of all that she tried to talk me into wearing 3 bras for a fucking school dance lmao. I was 15. I suppose I\u2019m lucky those comments never really got to me because I already had plenty of shit to deal with. \n\nGrowing up with my mom saddled me with all kinds of issues. Of course, it has always been up to no one but me to cope, fix myself, and keep myself sane. \n\nShe threatens suicide constantly these days but when I try to ask her about it she brushes it off as a joke. She started saying she had PTSD from the news years ago when she read about it in some random web article. Truth be told, I can\u2019t find it in me to care even if she isn\u2019t doing this for attention. \n\nThe only major unpleasant experience in my life that wasn\u2019t caused by her that I can think of is the bullying, but even then I wouldn\u2019t have gotten bullied if she didn\u2019t make me so egotistic by talking everyone else down.\n\nI don\u2019t have any family to confide in. I sent my brother a long, remarkably civil rant text about my mom and my lifelong misery. He said he would reply when he was less busy but never did. Now we both act like I never sent that text. \n\nTeachers are out of the question too, because I can tell they\u2019re neither trained nor eager to deal with this kind of thing. School social worker? Nah lol, I\u2019ve seen her haul autistic kids out of the classroom for crying in class and much more. \n\nFriends? At the peak of my suffering, all my friends were tweens. They didn\u2019t have the maturity to say anything helpful, and in the worst case they would spread rumours about me. In 5th grade, this girl vented to us about her parents fighting and everyone brushed her off, calling her an attention seeker. Now that I\u2019m not suffering so bad I feel like dying every day, I don\u2019t feel the need to burden my friends. I\u2019d probably get upset if they didn\u2019t respond in the most empathetic manner, so it\u2019s still best I keep my suffering to myself. \n\nOk fucking hell I need to wrap up my homework and I\u2019ll probably sleep at 2 tonight. I gotta wake up extra early for school tomorrow. God damn \ud83d\ude2d if you made it here, I\u2019m really grateful.

So I'm basically hunting for jobs now. Either I find some thing full time or something part time that I can do in the spare hours outside of the part time work I already do. My mum went to a social gathering at the end of last year and somebody flexed that their daughter get's good government benefits such as more ease getting a home loan as a teacher at a public school. They also gave my degree a lot of shit about being useless and only getting temporary jobs if you were lucky enough. My mum decided to urge me to re enrol in uni for a teaching degree and take advantage of the fact I would have less years than someone who doesn't yet have a bachelors degree. And dad just goes with whatever she says so it isn't helping either. I told them that they need to accept that the job hunting situation is a bitch and that you don't have a bunch of employers who are hyped to bring you in fresh out of uni. Literally everyone and their dog has a degree of some sort. Bachelors degree is the new entry level (plus a whole bunch of networking and previous eXpErIeNcE) My dad suggests I enrol and study anyway, and just drop out whenever I get a good job. Mum practically threatened to bring hell to the house over this matter. Unis don't make it easy to do that past the first 4 or so weeks of testing the waters. Thankfully, the people at this gathering talked about how fucked the medical school situation is and how hospitals would rather hire foreign immigrant doctors than the country's own fresh batch of graduates, so my parents have kind of backed off hassling me about GAMSAT and med school prospects. Uni has left me very burnt out with the onslaught of unpaid clinical placements where I have to work full time unpaid while still doing my part time work. Fuck you capitalism. But my parents don't think I should be out of uni while I'm not working a decent wage. And they also think I\u2019m destined to not find decent employment without this teaching degree, a rEaL dEgReE. They said I need to be a teacher for the sTaBiLiTy. Apparently if I do too many contract jobs, nobody will want to hire me because they will think I keep getting fired. A lot of my friends waited until a year to get some sort of full time employment after their graduation, but it's a doom and gloom situation in my parents' eyes.\n\n\nMy priority now is to job hunt. At this point, I definitely resent myself for letting my parents make me turn down volunteering and part time work opportunities I landed myself into that they didn\u2019t like. I hate that I backed away from opportunities because I felt I wasn\u2019t up for it because of what I was told by them. They focus too much on being book smart. My experience repertoire is a lot less than what I planned for after grade 12 and I really beat myself up over this every time a job application doesn't work out lately. They say they want what\u2019s best, but to be honest, it\u2019s all about bragging rights, I mean I knew that they love to show off, but I can see now that anything that doesn\u2019t look good to show off should be cut off. The part time work I\u2019m doing right now (tutoring) looks great for showing off, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been allowed to do it without getting shit from them, but school students can only come along after hours or on weekends so it does kinda limit my earning potential. They don\u2019t know how the job market works, what grad programs are, or what a lot of the positions are, they just get confused and tell me that these things are useless. They told me that I should be embarrassed about my situation compared to my friends, but then said I need to ignore feeling left behind when returning to uni to get the pRoPeR degree, what the fuck does that even mean. They told me I should be embarrassed when my friends find out, but my friends have been honestly been the most understanding and supportive, pointing out opportunities I could apply, offering to be a reference if needed, asking people they have connections around, some even submitting applications on my behalf when they have spare time. They are going above and beyond and I love them to pieces as cringe as it sounds. They all knew something fishy was going on when I told them I\u2019m returning to uni. So the masters of teaching degree is about to start, and I\u2019m honestly not excited. The truth is, I had actually considered doing either this masters degree or masters accounting down the line in the future as a solid maybe, but it only works if I\u2019m doing it on my own terms. My friends and I all agree that I will grow and learn more from work experience at this point than any uni shenanigans. Also, my brain is done with uni for now, I don\u2019t have that spark to study and do more unpaid placements at the moment. \n\n\nI feel like I have to work on myself to gain back the ambition that was taken away from me as well as the additional ambition I\u2019m gonna need to push through. My other plan is if I don\u2019t get a job in the near future, I\u2019ll probably seek mental health services in case I go on a downward spiral. I know Medicare can provide several partially rebated sessions if your doctor puts you on a mental health treatment plan, but this is more a last resort.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677120601.0},{"title":"AP\u2019s complete lack of spiritual understanding or wisdom","author":"Zealousideal_Bee6800","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/119l9za\/aps_complete_lack_of_spiritual_understanding_or\/","text":"Whenever I am faced with an emotional, mental, or general life challenge, my parents never knew how to counsel me.

It's been my mom and I since... and the issue of money has been hard on both of us. My dad was the breadwinner and she was so used to my dad giving her anything she wanted. Right now she lives off of social security and some VA money, but no where close to what she was used to when dad was alive. \n\nI pay her rent $300 every month so there is no uneasiness (you would think), and so that I'm not being a bum living with her. \n\nI work part-time, what is called 'flex', and every 2 weeks I get about $700-$1000, it just depends on how many hours I've gotten in the pay period. Besides 300 rent, I have my car payments, my personal bills like my phone, paying off my credit card, and I pay for a few utility bills, including internet. I have enough money for groceries and to pay for my hobbies, to which I am very grateful for. I am glad that I have a job and that I'm not struggling as bad as others. It could always be worse. \n\nGrowing up my mom was bad with boundaries and unfortunately we've had an enmeshed mother\/daughter relationship. Ever since I've become aware, breaking down this enmeshed relationship has NOT been easy. Putting up boundaries has NOT been easy, especially because my mom acts like I'm betraying her, or treating her like shit (her exact words). Part of this enmeshment apparently is money. I've started to work in the kitchen at my job and I get some tips here and there. I have to split the tips with my co-workers, sometimes we only get 3 bucks each a day, or on a good day we get 30 bucks each. I had $21 of tips in my wallet yesterday and I took my mom out to eat, I paid with my debit card, and decided to pay $4 tip to the server. My mom asked me to give her all of my cash so she can have some spending money... I said no, which she argued \"I will give you 20 back, I have 20 at the house\", so I was like \"??? Huh? Then use your 20 at the house for spending.\" Me saying that pissed her tf off. I gave her 10 bucks and told her NO she doesn't need to pay me back, but I told her not to do it again, unless it's an emergency. \n\nThe way how she got pissed is so childish. She's in her 70's and asking her daughter for 'extra spending money'. Fuck off. You want money? Then go fucking earn it like everyone else does. I give her rent and I pay some of the bills. It's NOT my problem that she has a shit time managing her money and budgeting. It's not my problem. I can afford all my shit because I WORK for it. I don't have a husband to bully and abuse for money, I work for my own money. Try it sometime. \n\nShe does this shit in public too, I feel like to try to guilt me even more? Me saying \"no\" to my old asian mom, how cruel. IDGAF what random strangers think of me, unlike her. It just pisses me off that she cannot respect my money and not feel the need to ask for my money when she sees it. She is also not realizing that we are 2 separate adults.

She thinks because she provided for me when I was growing up, that I ought to do the same for her? No, woman! Bad boundaries. You are an adult, and an old one at that. Not my fault that you did not prepare yourself for your old years, not my responsibility to pick up after you. I can provide support, but that is it.\n\nAnyways... ugh. I literally cannot have physical cash with me when I go out with her. I have it hiding away somewhere in my room. I think it's just bullshit that I can't have money, that I earned, in my own wallet, because the mother I have is a child who wants my money, and will throw a fit if I don't give it to her. \n\nBtw if anyone is wondering, I am actually on the hunt for a roommate or room for rent, problem is most folks are charging at least $800 for a room. I may not be able to get out of here until I meet a man and we eventually live with eachother, or until I get a job that would pay enough for me to afford my own place. I live in Cali and rent is expensive, and rental realtors want you to make x3 the rent.

I am not a fast learner but I enjoy what I do. I love laboratory works and our practicals as it fascinates me so much, but I have a short attention span and tends to forget the first thing I am doing if I got bothered or someone \/ something caught my attention.\n\nAt first I was thankful they support my decision to enter my premed course because I am the first one to take med course in my family, they also let me decide which school I want (not with high tuition fee ofc, the tuition is fine but the teaching quality is definitely a masterpiece)..But I didn't know this will be taken against me..\n\nMy schedule was tight 1week lecture then the next week quizzes and practicals. Not to mention I became an irregular student and I need to retake classes because of my declining mental health (that up until this day is unchecked). I am not a fast learner so it would take all of my time and energy reviewing and memorizing, so it's hard for me to do household chores (I do my house responsibilities when I am free of course). So my brother and I alternate and cover for each other when that happens... She would call me lazy for not doing anything.  There are times that would get angry because she would tell me to do things forcefully while I am memorizing. Sometimes I would calmly remind her that it's not easy for me to juggle things as I like to do things one at a time and I have the shortest attention span\n\n(i also asked for herhelp to have my mental health checked or recommend me a doctor cause I don't know what to do, but she turned a blind eye and pretend she didn't hear that, she even use religion as the reason why my mental health is declining)\n\nShe would also use \"be thankful u are able to study\" like it was not her responsibility. I would point this out telling her that the moment she decided to have a child she should've thought of the responsibilities. But instead of understanding the situation, I got the usual \"How dare you talk back like I am not ur parent\".\n\nShe would also use the \"she also finished college\" card as a way to invalidate my feelings whenever I vent about school. It came to the point that I've had enough and dared her to read my condensed 20 page back to back microbiology reviewer cause I am done with her yapping and I am concern that I will fail cause my mental health is declining (she didn't do it she just kept dodging and invalidating my feelings). \n\nShe would also blackmail me to \" leave the house and never return and I should start supporting myself \"(happens every argument, ofc I can't because she will not permit me to find a job because according to her she can financially support) And during our argument she used that phrase again. So after that argument, I left the house bringing only my school uniform and reviewers to clear my head. \n\nI honestly can't take it anymore, even after all these years I still can't stand her toxic traits and would tell myself to just endure it. But it's beginning to give me tension headaches and all I can do was cry about it when it happens. I remember suddenly breaking down to my best friend because of this, she even said to me my family can't be my support system because of its toxicity.

Sorry, why do you pay attention to when I flush the toilet?? The first time I heard that I felt creeped out.\n\nHe asks me why I'm hiding and what I am hiding. I say nothing much. Then he gets angry because obviously there's something. He says \"from now on put your phone outside as soon as you get home from school and if you need to use it I will watch how much time you spend\". I would if I wasn't hiding such things. \n\nAnyways so I finally told him today that I sometimes play games, and of course, he told me to delete it. I wasn't expecting anything better. Then after some discussion, he's like \"fine whatever you want go play games and you'll end up working as a rubbish collector I don't care anymore\". That is his peak, he's so sick of it. He is certainly not saying I can play games, he's saying that he's really disappointed in me. Even my mum started scolding me, and yes she is quite scary too. She's very stern and gets riled up quickly.\n\nAfter I returned to my room (phone-less obv), I went into deep thought, and then he suddenly appeared in the room 10 min later. He said he's sorry and gave me a hug. Okay, it is nice of him to do that but I have to say, every argument ends that way. But it repeats. Every single time, he ends up saying that he shouldn't have done so and so and that he wouldn't do it again and then I also apologise. Next time, it happens again. I think he truly does mean it but there's just no way to change it as it is.\n\nUgh, every time this happens I am no longer in the mood to do my huge pile of endless homework. I'm currently not motivated to do anything tonight even though I previously planned to.\n\nSometimes I think: if I could see the end of my homework, then I would attempt to finish it quickly. It is because I know I can't finish it that I don't try to finish it.\n\nYes that sounds very contradicting because it should be: because there is so much then shouldn't I hurry up and do it?\n\nWhat is happening with my life...","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676980096.0},{"title":"Everyone in my Asian family calls me stupid, so I'm not going to try and salvage our relationships","author":"lostgrad20","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/117pwci\/everyone_in_my_asian_family_calls_me_stupid_so_im\/","text":"I (25F) am the daughter of APs that came to the States to get their advanced degrees several decades ago.

One time, he returned home from his work trip. He was tired and sleeping. I went to take his phone to play games, he got some for me when he was home and we played sometimes. I got bored and I decided to play games then I caught him cheating on my mum. That lady and my father were talking like husband and wife ( which includes a lot of inappropriate stuffs I am sorry I don\u2019t want to say anything about that ) I was really confused I thought it was my mum and dad\u2019s chat. Since there were a lot of inappropriate stuff, I kept the phone back to it\u2019s place and that time only my mum saw me then rushed to me and asked why I was touching his phone without permission.

Since you were born you never let your dad and I be happy for once \u201d I was like WTF? how is it my fault? How is it my fault that your husband is cheating on you? DID I TELL HIM TO DO THAT?

Sorry in advance if this post turns into a long rambling\/rant with no conclusive point. Truthfully, I don\u2019t know who to talk to\/vent to. Often it feels like the world is against me. Sounds dramatic because it\u2019s my racist and homophobic APs that are my sole critics. But at the end of the day and as much as I try to stray away, my racist and homophobic APs ARE my world. No matter what type of childhood traumas I have endured from them, I always have the understanding that their ideations come from their cultural background and upbringing. Nobody is perfect and I can\u2019t expect my parents to know the consequences behind their decisions. I also would not change some of the choices they have made that has in turned, effected my life; shaping me to be who I am and believe in. I completely understand that their decisions come from a place of believing they \u201cknow what\u2019s best\u201d. Unfortunately, all my understanding does not make life any easier. To avoid any confusion: I am an adult Asian woman in my mid-twenties and married to a black woman in her early 30s.\n\nI spent the entirety of my childhood sneaking around and keeping my parents in the dark when it came to any personal decisions due to fear of retaliation. My fear was validated in my junior year of HS when I was sent away to live with my AMs sister overseas for 8 months. All communication was cut from my friends and the rest of my family. My future was put on hold until further notice. My AM and her family from overseas worked together to trap me. I was given a date that the return trip was supposedly booked for. Her family from overseas even helped me prepare for the trip back home and packed my luggage KNOWING that I was going nowhere. They all lied to my face. What I did in those 8 months? That\u2019s another long story I may potentially write about in the future.\n\nFast forward a few years. I met my now wife at our previous place of work. I was VERY nervous introducing her to my family. At this point I felt safe to stop sneaking around and let my family in on more personal and intimate parts of my life. I had already become completely independent of my APs. It would be draining and nearly impossible to separate someone that I was falling in love with from my family. I began attempting to integrate her into my family. I did not want to force her in by bringing her to family functions out of respect for the comfortability of my at the time girlfriend, now wife and my APs. My AM met with us for brunch and was thankfully not rude but she certainly was uncomfortable. My AM and I spoke of it and she disapproved of the relationship because she \u201cdid not raise me this way\u201d. My wife and I held a small ceremony in our apartment, just the two of us with no support from anyone. What hurts the most is nobody has once considered how terribly it felt. My hurt translated into my marriage. I started having near impossible expectations to prove my relationship is successful with material things and every time we don\u2019t hit my unreasonable goal, I completely break down and blame everything except the fact that I was poisoning my marriage with my miserable self.\n\nWe\u2019re now coming into our 2nd year anniversary in a couple months. We want kids in the future. It takes a village to raise a child. I want our kids to have a relationship with their grandparents. I also have an older brother, sister-in-law, and nephew that I want to incorporate into my children\u2019s lives too. Today I tried to change the approach by asking my AM if she would be interested in being taken out for some food with my wife and I. She refused and basically told me she will never approve of my relationship and that it disgusts her. She even tried to bribe me and told me if I leave my relationship and move back home, she will give me whatever I want.\n\nThe holiday season is the worst. My coworkers have asked if my wife and I went to my parents\u2019 house to celebrate. I lie to them every time and say that we had a great time. I feel so bad seeing everyone around me in relationships with such welcoming families and I can\u2019t even provide that for my wife, who doesn\u2019t have a lot of family left.\n\nI just feel so helpless and don't know anyone that I can talk to that will be able to relate\/give insight or even sympathize.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676930212.0},{"title":"APs extremely negative\/skeptical about WFH.","author":"slushiesushisashimi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/1179rcn\/aps_extremely_negativeskeptical_about_wfh\/","text":"Currently working in Asia where I very recently transitioned from working in a 100% on site role (at a traditional Asian company) to a hybrid\/remote role at a different company.

They were all tools \/ voices in my head giving me reasons to see my mom as the victim of such a bad marriage (which she chose to stay in til my dad died?), and how it was up to me and me alone to be there for her when I start making money. (They came at me young. I think I was like 5 or 6 when they started.  I\u2019m now experiencing my midlife crisis.)\n\nI realized how much bullshit my brain had taken in.  When I realized this, my dad has passed several years prior, and now I being a dad can easily see how fucked up it was.  To have a child of mine turned against me using their tactics\u2026 just plain evil. \n\nAlso when my dad passed, I found out the reason my mom didn\u2019t divorce after so many years, was that she expecting to get $$$. But he didn\u2019t leave any for her, and what my sibling (who had power of attorney, cuz my mom was lazy) did find in the bank ended up getting used for years in a nursing home.  \n\nAfter he passed though, she kept accusing my sibling of stealing it, hiding it, using Bible verses against them, etc.  I started to see her true nature coming out (was blinded all these years by her playing the victim.)\n\nFast forward to more recent times (last 3-4 years), the last time I saw my mom her friend happened to be with her. Her friend and her tried to convince my wife to have another baby so her friend could move in WITH my mom, to our house, and she could take care of them both\u2026. Wtf?  Who invited my mom to live with us\u2026 and who the hell are you?!  Of course this was all orchestrated to put pressure on my wife at that time.\n\nAt any rate, I called out my mom and her passive-aggressive bullshit in a video one day after I\u2019d had enough.  I pulled the plug on any hopes I\u2019d be some savior. (Yet I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t listen or take me seriously, just like all my life.) As you might guess I got no love in response, and just comments from her siblings on how my dad was a horrible person, how dare I mention my saintly grandma, take down this video immediately, disrespectful, etc\u2026. \n\nNowadays my mom\u2019s health isn\u2019t doing so good.  But, I\u2019m not putting any money towards paying my moms bills (which are piling up.) Part of me feels responsible, like she\u2019s still my biological mom. But it\u2019s her entitlement and lack of acknowledging any responsibility for her past financial failures that keeps me from getting involved.  Its a black hole. Since nothing is her fault, there\u2019s no limit to the financial pain she\u2019s willing to put my family through.  \n\nIt\u2019s also the occasional hateful messages I receive from them, wishing for my death, calling me shit, that also keeps me at a distance.

I was always the sick kid and later the mentally ill kid. My mom was basically a single parent so it felt illegal to ever doubt her at all and it still does. Me and my two other siblings (25F & 10F) all have various fathers. Life was always rough but things took a bad turn when my mom got severely sick. We were left to fend for ourselves and that was around when she got pregnant with the 10 year old sibling. My mom's personality took a complete 180 after that and my elder sister and I jokingly refer to it as the before (younger siblings name )and after (younger siblings name ). I tried to be there for my mom as much as any 9 year old could. My mom said she hates us for not being there for her. My elder sister had\na ... different reaction. It was\nunderstandable because our mom was our whole world. We had no friends and no other life besides her. And she had to leave us to live alone for almost a year.\nOccasionally random adults would drop every now and then. I'm an adult now and it's starting to finally hit, all the trauma that 1 had forgotten. Everything that I went through. My mom treated me and my elder sister differently because she believed my sister has special needs. She has been taken to see several doctors again and again. All she has is slight ocd, depression and severe anger issues.\nWhile I know that it's wrong to compare me to her, I wish my mom took it seriously when I begged her to see a psychiatrist as well. | later got myself diagnosed because I couldn't take it anymore. I scrounged up as much as I could and I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, bod, ptsd, schizo affective disorder. My mom personally believes that all the doctors are wrong and she would rather I didn't take medication because l'm too quiet to be mentally ill. The whole reason I began to write this rant is because I asked anybody I could including the clinics because I briefly remember being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at age 13. I had to go through a series of various tests and surgeries recently and have been for months so this would be very useful to know. I simply asked her if she remembered anything and she said if you had kept your medical reports you would know and that she doesn't know anything.\n1 remember being 14 and crawling to her on my knees because I couldn't physically stand from being too weak and she said that I should have my dad take me to the hospital. I just puked and puked so much my sister had to drag me to the hospital instead. Constantly starved because she would get into moods and then when I mentioned it to my therapist my therapist asked my mom and she said I was lying. I was underage, which is why the therapist wanted to talk. I was called a slut and that no man will ever want me because I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my therapist mentioned hyper-sexuality. I got my first full time job at 15 struggling to get myself the necessities like soap and toothbrushes. I still buy too much in excess because I'm scared I'd go broke and not have any. I also found out my mom made me father take me as a newborn because she didnt want me. I always assumed that she started kicking me out at 13ish but apparently she did when I was around 7 as well. I used to sleep outside at the door and get ready for school once she let me in the morning.\nMy father found out through neighbors and he took me in till she was willing occasionally. My step mom hated me but even she fed me, let me sleep in the bed and took care of me. Ive so many more things and I just don't know why I'm even sad. I know my moms traumatized. I just wish I knew why she always treats me different. I would do anything for her but I watched my sister turn her back on her when she was on her death bed.\nMy friends want me to cut ties and prioritize myself more, so do my doctors.\nI'm slowly putting me before her.

She then gaslights me back by saying, \"well if I make you mad, you didnt have to be so negative about it!\"\n\nHere's one specific incident that happened over Christmas for context. I have NC with my sister because she's surprisingly a bigger narcissist than my mom. I cut her out of my life and I despise her so much that I cant even be in the same virtual groupchats or anything with her so I keep myself out of it. So over christmas, my mother gave me a giftcard of the chain restaurant my sister works at. It's clear as day where it came from (sister gets free gift cards all the time) and I was a little bothered to see it. I asked my mom where she got the giftcard and without hesitation, she told me that she went into the restaurant and bought it herself. It instantly got me upset and had to ask her how fucking stupid she really thinks I am. She literally never buys gift cards. She doesnt even buy gifts and only relies on regifting if she has a chance to have free toys for her grandchildren. She got upset too and yelled how I can be so ungrateful to not believe it. I hung up on her and dropped off the gifts she let me including toys she meant to leave for my son, pretty certain that the toys are regifted by my sister as well. If she said she did get it from my sister, I wouldnt be nearly upset and just decline the gift. But she had to lie to \"make things better\". \n\n So around this time, my therapist made me realize that talking back with petty revenge shouldnt be the way and my mom is kind of right, being negative back just shouldnt be the way. So it's pretty much best that I just keep in LC with her. But she keeps calling as if nothing happened and always wants to link up to see my son. I really dont want to do this anymore and I really dont even want to talk about her about the problems she caused. How would you guys handle it? I know my mom does everything for good intentions which is why I dont think she doesnt deserve my relationship but for fucks sake she never understands that lying so much is only going to get me so upset!","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1676910518.0},{"title":"Asian mom never stops criticizing me for everything I do","author":"OpeningVermicelli405","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/116zf6j\/asian_mom_never_stops_criticizing_me_for\/","text":"This really annoys me because I\u2019ve never had enough who\u2019s always judging and criticizing their kid as much as my Asian mom does.

But I guess laying it out like this on reddit might give me some epiphany or newfound peace. Before I tell the story, I wish to give some context for the story, which is that filial piety and Buddhism are incredibly toxic concepts in my life that have been used against me always. So I guess I\u2019ll just go straight into it.\n\nI grew up in an environment with two incredibly \u201ctoxic\u201d Asian parents; both with their own set of childhood traumas. My mother was abused physically and severely (i.e she would see her mum have sex with her boyfriend in a bed next to her and would be physically by her father until she was near the brink of death), whereas my dad was deprived of love by both his mother and father to the point where he lacked the concept of empathy and reciprocal nature of love for a majority of love, only learning about it presently through Buddhism (he\u2019s brainwashed by Buddhism now though). Tldr they ended up together when my mum was 17 because she was desperate for a family and saw that he had a penis meaning he could give her children. Their dynamic has been toxic for many years. Mum would do absolutely everything in the family while quietly resenting dad for everything while he did absolutely nothing other than work (in which he had to be dictated by mum for several years to do well). This would include not spending time with me and my siblings, making my mum do EVERYTHING (drive, cook, babysit) .etc.\u00a0 My two brothers and I had to tolerate her vocalizing her resentment towards dad at us frequently. She would go on and on about how men are useless, how she wish she never married him, then somehow convince herself that he has good qualities such as loyalty (the bare minimum) and then gaslight us into believing our family was absolute perfection (I actually believed that for the longest time). Now here\u2019s the thing: my mum is the most giving woman and super beautiful and talented, I always believed that she deserved better. I was always made aware of aspects in our family that made me incredibly grateful to my parents. Mum spent over 50k per year on activities such as Chinese martial arts and cheerleading lessons\/competitions simply because she wanted to see me flourish. Even though money was never easy, she would try her hardest to fulfil the needs of us, her children. And even though dad was rather incompetent, he never left our side physically and always worked. Therefore I understand we were better off than most family\u2019s. But\u2026 somethings just never felt right.\n\n\u00a0I noticed our relatives were never present and that was because they were all abusive assholes on both sides. Not only were they not around but they also doubled my mothers resentment on dad because of his side of the family, and guess who ended up on the receiving end of such resentment? Me and my brothers. It was not uncommon for me to grow up hearing mum tell me how similar I am to that of her abusive father, how selfish I am like her mother and how my habits remind her of my dads parents who were \u201clowly farmers\u201d. This is an insult in Chinese culture because farmers are known to have the lowest social status. I grew up hating myself, wondering why I had to be born the way I was, and why I had to have dads \u201cgenetics\u201d (which is what mum would use to point out the reasons behind my flaws\u201d.\u00a0 If I tried to share my feelings as a kid , I would be shut down and called selfish \/ unfilial to my parents for talking back, sometimes I would be beat. One time dad pulled my hair and threw a vacuum cleaner at me because I refused to engage with my Aunty (a very horrid woman according to my mum) via wechat. Presently, for the past couple of months mum had been venting a lot more to me about dad (my two siblings refuse to engage with her anymore because she vents too much and will get angry at anyone who offers her suggestions, claiming that we are over stepping our positions as their children).\u00a0\n\nShe would go on and on and on to me about the traumas that dad inflicted onto her, with most of the stories being ones that I have heard at least a thousand times already. I know I could always just ignore her the way my brothers do. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I spent the most time around her but regardless I struggled with ignoring her completely. I feared the thought of her going through everything alone and having nobody to talk to. A little while ago, she met a man who she fancies. They\u2019re just friends but she has made it known that she has feelings for him. So now not only will she vent about dad, but will add additional input as to how much better he is than our father. Because I have always been grateful for her sacrifices, I\u2019d listen and even support her. I told her if she ever wants to leave dad we will be okay because I will take care of our younger brother. She said she was worried about what would happen to dad if she did divorce him because he can\u2019t even drive or pay bills so I said that I could take care of him too when I get a stable job and he could even live with my older brother.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, fast forwarding this continuing for months on end. I finally had enough and \u00a0eventually told her to just divorce him after every conversation (my older brother said the same thing but only once though). I mostly only brought up divorce because mum was talking about how she wanted to do it. Mind you, I never start these conversations. It is always her. Last night I came home and saw mum deep in thought. She told dad to come downstairs so the three of us could have a conversation. I was confused as to what was going on.\u00a0 She asked if I think they should divorce and I said yes. Turns out, dad had told her that he was happy to be cheated on for the \u201cpeace and wellness\u201d of the family. This set mum off because she felt like he was trying to act like the better person and her the villain. They basically fought in front of me in a loop for an hour. Well, not really fighting. You know Beth and jerry from Rick and Morty? Yep, that basically summarizes their dynamic. Mum would vent at dad about her resentment and threaten divorce while he admits his wrong and tells her she\u2019s right and then manipulate her emotionally by acting pitiful and helpless. E.g., he would be like I want you to be happy so you can leave , I never deserved you in the first place. But then if he actually feels like she\u2019s going to go through with it he would pull the \u201cI would be so helpless and miserable without you\u201d card. That dynamic went on for the whole night with me trying to mediate them. They eventually settled on divorcing and sending dad to a temple for him to pursue Buddhism\u2026 psyche. They made up today and decided not to divorce cuz she pitied him again. These past few days have been an absolute shit show. My 16 year old little brother cried because of mum during his car ride to school, dad broke down crying, I broke down crying silently , but at least my older brother is thankfully far away from this in another country. So you guessed it, I absolutely lost it when I heard they weren\u2019t divorcing. I told mum and dad that they should at least go see a marriage counsellor if they weren\u2019t divorcing because this can\u2019t continue. This made mum lose it and she told me she didn\u2019t have any problems. She ended up blaming everything on me telling me she only considered divorce because I was \u201cpushing\u201d her about it everyday and apparently \u201cI\u201d was the one encouraging her to vent about dad everyday too. She even went as far as to implying that the only reason my brothers are affected is because I was brainwashing them. She said that she didn\u2019t need my help and that I was controlling her and trying to step over her position as the leader in the family. Regardless of these things she said I tried to stay calm and asked if she could at least stop venting to us about dad. She said that it\u2019s her house so she can say whatever she wants to us and that I shouldn\u2019t be telling her what she can and cannot do. The conversation ended with her telling me to just leave and to leave her and dads relationship alone even though she was the on who brought me into it in the first place. I was made to sound like a home wrecker who was tampering with her and her husbands perfect relationship.\n\nThe next following days were the worst. I told dad in private that if he wasn\u2019t going to change their dynamic or see a therapist then I\u2019d send him to the temple myself. Was it an empty threat? Yes. Should I have stated it more nicely? Absolutely. But I was just so done with them at that point. Guess what my dad ended up telling mum. He told her instead \u201cguess what your daughter said, she said that if you don\u2019t divorce me she\u2019s going to send me to the temple herself\u201d. Do I believe he did that on purpose because he knew manipulating the sentence initially that would make mum pissed at me? Yup. He\u2019s like a child, always telling on me to mum , even mum calls him her \u201c4th child\u201d. Later on I was left alone at home with dad. I attempted to question him calmly on why he\u2019d worded the sentence the way he did even though he clearly heard what I actually said. I guess a part of me just really wanted to believe he wasn\u2019t actually manipulative. Instead of a mature response, he gave me a prideful look that he\u2019d seen Buddhists give on tv, looked down at me and told me \u201cI have no obligation to provide you with any explanation\u201d. I asked if he could at least apologize for that. He responded with \u201caccording to Chinese culture, as a father I do not have to apologize to you and according to Buddhism you committed a grave sin of trying to tear mum and dad apart\u201d. Instantly I realized that he was salty because I agreed with mum that she should divorce him.\u00a0 I asked if he could at least hug me and tell me he loves me then because that was something as a father he never did. I wanted to put everything behind before I lost my sanity. He said coldly no because me and him are simply a father daughter relo and that was it. All of a sudden all I could see was blind rage, as if all theses years and months of tolerance came flying out\u2026 my boyfriend arrived at the house and I went to pack my things as my little brother asked what happened only to rage at dad for always going on and on about Chinese culture and Buddhism. My little brother who never showed emotion broke down into tears screaming. I came back downstairs and threw chairs around, screaming at the top of my lungs as I pushed down furniture. It was one of the first times I experienced pure rage; adrenaline, hyperventilation and all. Dad just went on about how mums gonna kill me once she finds out and I\u2019m gonna be punished by the heavens. I turned to look at him, he smirked and told me I\u2019m nothing but a daughter to him by birth so\u2026 I slapped him. This led him to lunge at me in attempt to strangle me in which my boyfriend butt in and took the hits. My little brother tried to stop him and also hit him in the head as I kicked him to get off my boyfriend. My dad apologised to my boyfriend immediately though. Me and my brother went to stay at my boyfriends for two days in which my mum called asking why I hit dad saying she will never forgive me, also claiming that a father can hit his child but a child can never lay a hand on their parent. I understand that\u2026 but in my eyes he was not my father anymore. She called me ungrateful and violent. I guess I am.\n\nWhen we went back home they had prepared a fully home cooked meal which we hadn\u2019t had in a long while. We all apologized to each other and mum did to me too, but she always does. She\u2019s had a habit of changing moods and changing her mind very often, so I doubt peace would last very long. Long story short I\u2019m moving out soon. Since they believe I\u2019m the source of the problem and that I\u2019m badly influencing my brother. I\u2019ve wanted to leave for a long time now, I\u2019m glad\u2026 my friend tells me I\u2019ve experienced what\u2019s called reactive abuse but how? They provided so much for me and I\u2019ve been nothing but ungrateful. I was the first to act with physical aggression to the hands that fed me yet why do I not feel as guilty as I should feel? I feel conflicted and dirty.\u00a0\n\nTo those who got this far thanks for reading. Please give me advice and reason.

I currently work as a secondary school teacher in a discipline that isn't in demand so as a result it can be quite difficult finding a permanent job anywhere. I am based in the UK and my teaching job brought me to London all the way from the north of England (around 200 miles away) so as a result I have been living here for the last 6 ish months. I am a 26 Male with a Bengali background and I have sorta planned my life for the next few years, with me paying off some debt that I have, then saving for a flat deposit\/buying a flat and then potentially getting married. The issue I have is that I am finding it difficult to fully settle in when my mom keeps sending me job applications for teachers of my discipline in my home town.

Contrary to a lot of other posters on the sub, I was raised on welfare despite having Asian parents and constantly wanted to do better for myself, and my excuse for there being a 'lack of jobs' was more a 'way out' of where I am from and to potentially build a life somewhere else in the country. I have only been in my current job for around 6 months and wanted to stay for at least another year, but I have no idea how to bring this up to my mother. To make things more difficult, I live in a single-parent household, (my dad passed a few years ago) but I do have 2 other siblings that still live at home.

I have completed my degree and currently working in a corporate company. Since I'm at marriage age according to her she has found someone from one of our relative's son and forcing me marry him. He's 26 years old and he has good education and currently doing business and earning in lakhs. I know it sounds like I'm lucky to get this kind of proposal but I have my own dreams and I'm not ready for marriage yet. I want to do something on my own and want to earn good income and want to take care of my mom. But when I explain this she's not understanding at all.\n\nMy mom and her side of close relatives ( her brothers and their wives, my mom's mom) are also forcing me into this marriage. This conversation is going on for the past 1 month on and off. I thought my family will respect my decision when this topic come up but they proved me wrong. My mom is heavily influenced by her brothers and SIL's.\n\nAccording to them this is the best proposal I could get in this lifetime. I rejected the proposal when it was bought up one month ago by my mom. After that she made me go to her native where all her relatives are and they all try to convince me but I stick to my decision. Those 2 to 3 days were literal hell. They were constantly presurring me to say Yes but when they got to know that I'm not going to give In, they started scolding saying I don't respect elders and I don't have any sentiments. On top of that they said do you think you are so beautiful that men will form queue to marry you ?\nOf are you earning in lakh to show this much of attitude to us ?\n\nSo I acted to get along with this proposal if all of my demands are fulfilled. 1. I need another two years after that I'll think about marriage. 2. I need to complete my further studies 3. Groom has to settle in the same city where I'm currently living.\n\nMy family refused to all of this saying you are doing this to cancel this proposal or you are already in some relationship. If you do then tell us now itself and don't spoil our reputation later for which I replied NO, I don't have any!\n\nNow it's been month but my mom is still not giving up this topic.\nWhenever I try convince her to understand me all she say is\n1. You have agree to this marriage if you love and care for me\n2. You don't value my words and I'm your mother, you don't respect me.\n3. What will others think if I let you do whatever you want to do.\n4. Choose me or whatever it is you want to do.\n5. I'm getting health issues because of worrying about you and your future.\n\nNow the topic is in such a heat that my mom is emotionally blackmailing. She's asking me to write and sign on a blank paper that I don't have any relationship to her anymore. Once I sign that she wants me to leave the hose and she'll sell our house and go to Orphanage. \n\nListening to all of this really hurts as this is not what I wanted. All I wanted her to understand me and support my dreams. All I'm trying to do is for both of us. I want to take care of her.\n\nI have spoken to her and tried to convince her as much as possible but she's so stubborn and asking me to leave my job and stay at home.\nAccording to her I'm behaving like this because of my job and earning income. \n\nI would like to know how can I handle this situation.\nAny suggestions or advice would be helpful.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1676792047.0},{"title":"I am (18F) dating a Caucasian (19M)","author":"Primary_Oil9074","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/116egya\/i_am_18f_dating_a_caucasian_19m\/","text":"So I recently moved to the states for college, away from my parents who reside in Dubai.

The complex PTSD. The intuitive ability to read abusive strangers right away, even when others don't see it yet or believe you. Being the family scapegoat, who bore the brunt of most of the family's abuse, maybe I was different to begin with? Anyways.\n\nMy single AM surrounded herself with enablers, so I was surrounded only by adults who fell for my mom's outside mask, believing she was this super great, sacrificial person with 0 fault. No one was aware of her abuse behind closed doors. This conditioned me for years always feel \"less than\", indebted, and \"grateful\" to anyone who mistreated or bullied me bc I was taught to see abuse=love.\n\nIf I heal one day and become \"normal\" (my main motivation now), I will always remain distinct. I will always stand out for not having a biological family, having to find a \"chosen family\" instead. That and also having to find solace and content with just being me, for me.

She told me in confidence that she used to do it to my uncle, her youngest brother when she and their other siblings thought he \u201clost his way\u201d because he was too eager to get married to someone the family doesn\u2019t approve of. He ended up not marrying the girl and is still single and living with my grandma still.\n\nBack to the story, how it works is that the AM would go to someone equivalent to a priest in our religion and get some \u201cblessed water\u201d which is just plain water. The priest would pray and set the water next to him in hopes that the water would absorb his prayers and whoever drinks it will have a change of heart.\n\nUsually, the change of heart should be something the in line with the person requesting the \u201cblessed water\u201d be made.\n\n**How I came to know she messed with my drinking water:**\n\nWater doesn\u2019t taste the same. I usually refill my bottle with the water from the water dispenser we have at home.\n\nBut after this huge blown out fight with the AM, I started noticing that every time I came back from an outing, my water tastes different and at first I thought the water expired lol but overtime I realized it\u2019s only once I came home from an outing that the water tastes different.\n\nSo I decided to mark the level of water in my water bottle before I leave and when I came back, I noticed there\u2019s more water in my bottle than when I last saw it. So that confirmed my suspicions that she\u2019s been gradually adding the \u201cblessed water\u201d into my water bottle in small, almost unnoticeable amounts.\n\nI\u2019m sensitive to a lot of things eg smell and taste thankfully. So I\u2019m pretty sure wherever she got her blessed water, it\u2019s not from our home\u2019s water dispenser. Probably bought a gallon of water from the store and had that one \u201cblessed\u201d. \n\nThe only reason she did it when I left the house was because we weren\u2019t on speaking terms and of course I would not consent to her adding some water she believes could \u201cchange my mind\u201d. She was so close yet so far with her assumptions\u2014she could have apologized and taken accountability for all the physical and emotional abuse but that would take years of changed behavior and active reflection on her part which I\u2019m sure her skank ass is incapable of anyway so she decided to take the easy way out by asking a priest to bless some water and adding that water into my drinking water.\n\nAnyways, when I first found out I was livid because it feels like a boundary of mine has been crossed. Now I\u2019ve completely given up on her and I can crack jokes about it. And I\u2019m not associated with the religion I was born in anymore. \n\nWhat a time, I wish she\u2019s living her worst life and I hope karma gets to her.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676687779.0},{"title":"Is it just me, or was anyone else forced to be right handed as a kid?","author":"Confident-Trust-1339","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/114xvxq\/is_it_just_me_or_was_anyone_else_forced_to_be\/","text":"I remember one day when I was in middle school, my mom happily told me she slapped me right hand or something to force me to use it, because I was naturally left handed.  \n\nNow looking back I\u2019m like\u2026 why was she smiling?

My mother wanted me to be a dentist. She thinks that I had that idea myself but I originally had no actual plans but I did it to please her. I then realize I wanted to be a pharmacist when I graduated high school but was discouraged from her as the \"lack of job opportunities\" and further discouragement from my uncle and grandmother. \n\nI got into college in biochemistry but had bad grades and cannot apply for dental school at all now and haven't graduated it yet and it's taking too long. I knew I wasn't smart to begin with. I just had confronted her and told her about the plans to change into nursing. I have no options about my future and we are just messy about thinking about what to do. I was really scared about disappointing her. Me telling her I don't want to continue in dentistry makes her disappointed and anxious. \n\nShe mentions how nursing will be difficult and it is different from being doctors. I know but I don't have any options left to me at my current state. I am going to get a CNA certification this summer and it takes two years (ASN) to be a nurse and shes even more disappointed about it. \n\nI don't know what to say because I'm nothing special. I know I wasn't special enough to be a doctor\/dentist. I am okay with doing anything in the medical field and is majorly scared what if I can't even do nursing? \n\nOur current situation is that we aren't middle class per say. We have our own house to live in and a second place for small rental income. She works at her job full time and doesn't have health insurance. We worry about utilities, taxes, and also health insurance for her part. She doesn't qualify for low income benefits and we live in NYC. \n\nTLDR: Major changes in career plans + Disappointment from mother.\n\nUpdate: thanks for the support; my mom was very disappointed but not angry. I thought she was gonna get angry at me being a failure. But just upset I decided to drop from dentist to nurse which is harder in work load, and I spend too much time trying to pursue dentistry and ended having a late career change with nothing done. She said she rather I went with pharmacist in the beginning. It was just words of disencouragement back then but I felt like maybe I could have pushed it further at that time. She had it rough so she wished the best for me. We are working on trying to figure out what types of Nursing would work for me that might also get her on family insurance of some kind.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676678015.0},{"title":"\"Autism\" and \"Hikikomori-ism\" uses the same word in Chinese lol.

Sometimes shes sweet, most of the time she out of no where starts yelling at me even things I didn't do. We currently live in her current elderly patient's home, since she's a live-in caregiver. We do have a home but its far away on the south side. Every month I would stay in our home in the south side, whenever the boss (elderly woman's son) comes over to visit his mom. I only stay for 3 days and theres lots of days in between before I have to go back again. (It's a long story of why I have to stay with her plus its close to job opportunities)\n\nWe have unfortunately have rats in our home, no matter how clean or how many times we put out mouse traps. In context, I am not a clean freak like my mom, but am in no way a disgusting slob. My eldest brother on the other hand is. A year ago, I was living in the Philippines with my brothers and my dad during my college years. I witnessed how disgusting my brother's room can get. \n\nVape stains on the wall, used underwear everywhere, moldy food, etc. So fast-forward to  current time where I am back in our home. She got super angry at me and started yelling because she saw rat droppings. She claimed that I was a disgusting lazy slob because she thinks it's my fault the droppings were there. I KNOW I cleaned everything and put away food properly last month. But that doesn't stop rats from dropping their business now wont it?\n\nYet Im the one to blamed for it. The reason why this incident makes me upset because it's not just a one time thing. EVERYTIME she thinks I'm doing something wrong she praises her precious son saying, \"If he was here he would have cleaned everything that no rat droppings would be here\". Yet knowing he's actually a slob.\n\nWhy is it that when my brother does something, he's off the hook or even seen as this precious angel. Like she overlooked the fact that he fought with his classmate almost getting expelled (I was the one holding him back), threw a secret party while my dad was out and fought with my friend (causing many video taped of the incident), secretly flew in his girlfriend to our house while my dad was on his sibling trip, drunkenly slept over his friends house after the party leaving all the doors open and unlocked and the house a tornado mess. BUT guess who is seen as the devil? ME!\n\nShe even blamed me for her failing marriage just because my selfish father all of the sudden wanted to come with me to the Philippines to tend to his farm. IT WAS THEIR IDEA for me to go to college in the Philippines, yet she said word for word, \"I HATE YOU. MY MARRIAGE IS FAILING BECAUSE OF YOU!\". This was said literally a week before I had to leave to another country. What a sweet mom huh?\n\nNow how do I know she's playing favorites? During my college years I received text messages from \"be careful if your dad hits your brother again. I wish he'd hit you\" to \"Even if your brother was in the wrong and you were in the right, I will always pick him because he's my firstborn\"\n\nShe literally told me today that i never done anything for her. Guess who was the one that was the messenger between my mom and dad? The one who had to tell my dad to call my mom then come back to my mom to tell her to call him first then back and forth. Many hours of her stories about how horrible my dad is. ME! I was the one who kept getting angrier when my dad is so immature to not wanting to call first and for causing this domino effect. I was the one who kept pestering my dad over and over and over again. All this while stressing over freaking nursing school, where my focus should have been. Kept trying to make them have some sort of communication. But I guess that doesn't mean anything. Blame this toxic marriage onto me not my brothers, but me. \n\nWhy do you think  Im the target? I remember during mom and my dad's yelling fights, she came to my room one night and punched me while I was asleep. Im so jealous of my friends who have a healthy relationship with their parents\n\nAnd no please don't tell me to just move out because not everyone have the luxury or opportunity to, I just need emotional support please","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676659939.0},{"title":"\u201cChildren must obey their parents.

But they'll never realise why Asian parenting gets the most criticisms and controversies among various child-rearing styles.\n\nTo my knowledge, in Dutch and Scandinavian parenting, obedience is virtually non-existent since parents are more likely to value their children in family affairs and use two-way communication. While it's not directly related, it also explains why [the Netherlands and Scandinavia are among the happiest places in the world](https:\/\/worldhappiness.report\/ed\/2022\/happiness-benevolence-and-trust-during-covid-19-and-beyond\/#ranking-of-happiness-2019-2021), since their cultures encourage active participation in everything.\n\nMeanwhile, APs never attempt to value their children as humans other than their \"purpose\" as a \"retirement investment\". And they'll use their seniority, victim complex and other issues to force obedience on their children, which is a sure way to inflict generational trauma on them. We also can't set boundaries with our APs because according to API apologists, they \"love us\" and \"want the best for us\", but often at the expense of our free will and happiness. Asians aren't always happy with their families and lives, but people don't see problems with the problematic ideology and culture.\n\nThat's the difference between Asian and other parenting styles. Yet am I supposed to believe Asian parenting could produce the desired effect API apologists consider it could achieve?

I know I'm overreacting but I think it's bs that she is selling me short and trying to make me feel worst than I already do. The reason she is saying this is because she's anxious I won't find another job or something. She introduced this anxiety thought to me, even though it never existed in the first place. I think this attitude is not good for your child because what you're really doing is putting them down. I guess it's to control us. It's frustrating because I wish they were encouraging. I am pretty successfully because I worked hard but their negative attitude really discouraged me in life and slowed my progress. \n\nAnd hey guess what? Two weeks later, my boss tells me he got my job back. They are giving me an offer, which I will probably negotiate for more money than before.
