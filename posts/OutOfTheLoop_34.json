My understanding is that the reason for the change was the improved understanding of autism and the conclusion that the two aren’t really different conditions. That and of course the fact that Hans Asperger was a cock muffin.\n\nI was listening to a podcast where they review documentaries and the documentary in this episode was 10-ish years old. In the documentary, they kept talking about how the subject had Asperger’s. The hosts of the podcast went on a multi-minute rant about how they were so sorry the documentary kept using that term and that they know it’s antiquated and how it’s hurtful/offensive to many people and they would never use it in real life. [The podcast episode is here](https://audioboom.com/posts/8231422-a-beautiful-mind-unraveled) and the rant is around the 44 minute mark.\n\nAm I supposed to be offended by the term Aspie? Unless the person is a medical professional and should know better, I genuinely don’t care when people use the old name. I don’t really have friends on the spectrum, so maybe I missed something, but I don’t understand why Asperger’s would be more offensive than, say, manic depressive (as this condition is now called bipolar disorder).",
