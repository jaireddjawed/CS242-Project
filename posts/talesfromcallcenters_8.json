        "text": "I had this call yesterday where I work.  Our address verification system on the website sucks and will often flag addresses with mixed letters and numbers (like 3B'S &amp; K which is a real road or a house number like 350A), PO Boxes, or Apartment/suite numbers as invalid.  This leads to us having to take manual orders.\n\nSo basically I start opening the form for taking a manual order while he natters on about the tax being wrong and the system kept making him order 4 of the item and he only wanted 3.  I explain that I will have to take a manual order because it sounds like there may be multiple issues with the website.  You know if you have ever worked for customer service for a place that orders, the last two issues are customer error.  But rather than take the extra 15 minutes and discover that he still can't figure out how to edit his cart to show the right amount of product before he tries to place the order, a manual order is gonna save me time and effort.  His response actually caused me to completely go silent and have to mentally scramble to a) not laugh and b) pretend I did not hear him.  \n\nHe literally asked if our system was causing issues because he voted for Trump.  Like completely serious sounding.  I have no idea if he was being serious or thought it would be a funny joke.  All it caused was awkward silence and me wanting to get this guy off the phone before I cracked up. ",

        "text": "Like many companies, we sometimes run promotions with special discount codes for people to use, and we have some long term discount codes we can give out to people for customer appeasement or as a loyalty bonus. We make the codes as simple and as memorable as possible so that our customers can enter them easily at the checkout. Most of them are for 10 or 15% off, or for some free stuff on their order. Sometimes the codes do not work for one reason or another, as the customer (who I shall call DG, for discount guy) found out today.\n\n**DG:** I am trying to place an order on your website and NONE of the discount codes I am trying are working.\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry to hear that. Could I please check which codes you are trying to use? Two of our promotions have ended within the last couple of weeks, so they might not be valid anymore.\n\n**DG:** I have several, so one of them should still be valid. The first one I tried was Christmas10.\n\n**Me:** Um... that was a special Christmas offer, DG. It ended on December 27.\n\n**DG:** The website didn't say that.\n\n**Me:** When we start a promotion, we make sure that the start and end dates are clearly listed and we removed the advert for the Christmas promotion from our website on December 27. I'm sorry, but that code hasn't been valid since then.\n\n**DG:** Hmph. What about NewYear1718?\n\n**Me:** Same situation as the Christmas code - it was a limited time only.\n\n*he also gives me the 2 latest discount codes for the promotions which ended within the last 2 weeks, and I inform him of the running dates for both of them*\n\n**DG:** I suppose you are about to tell me it is the same with Easter18? If so, I hope you realise that this is false advertising as it didn't say that there was a time limit next to them.\n\n**Me:** Yes.. Could I please check where you have got these discount codes from? Whenever we put a promotion on our website or email our customers about them, we do always make sure that the start and end times are clearly stated.\n\n**DG:** I got them from [RandomCouponWebsite I had never heard of]\n\n**Me:** Ok DG. I'm sorry for any confusion here, but that website has nothing to do with us, and it looks like they have just gathered a load of codes from various websites and left them on there without any details or checking if they are still valid. \n\n**DG:** What about love14? That doesn't work when I try it.\n\n**Me:** That was for Valentines Day only. Do you have any codes which you have found from somewhere other than [random coupon website]?\n\n**DG:** Yes. [generic member's introductory discount code for signing up to our newsletter]\n\n**Me:** Ok, that is a one time use discount code per customer. Have you used it on a previous order?\n\n**DG:** No.\n\n**Me:** Can I take your account details so that I can look into this for you?\n\n**DG:** I don't have an account with you yet, and I am not signing up until I can get a working discount code off my first order.\n\n**Me:** Well the code you have given me is a one off discount for 10%, which you can use once you register an account with us and sign up for our newsletter. If you sign up for our newsletter, you will be notified of our latest offers and codes, so I would recommend it.\n\n**DG:** I just told you that I wouldn't unless I can get a working discount first.\n\n**Me:** *thinking that he really can not possibly have any other discount codes to try, but asking out of customer service professionalism* Do you have any other codes which aren't working?\n\n**DG:** [gives me 2 more codes which are secret customer reward codes. We have never advertised these anywhere, and one of them is for our special high spending / high profit customers for either when something goes wrong and requires us to change the status on the account for them to be used. If he has never placed an order with us, he really should not have them].\n\n**Me:** I'm not sure where you have got those codes from, but they are for certain customers only and we do not advertise them anywhere. If you really do not want to sign up for an account first, I can give you a discount code for 5% off now. Let me just find it for you...\n\n**DG:** No. I want 10% off.\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, but we do not currently have any 10% discounts at the moment, unless you sign up for an account with us. Customer accounts are completely free and will not cost you anything to have. You will also get loyalty points on every purchase which you can use as a discount on future orders.\n\n**DG:** I want 10%. Why won't you honour the codes I found online?\n\n**Me:** As I have already explained, DG, those codes all expired several months ago. The website you found them on has nothing to do with us whatsoever.\n\n**DG:** You should still honour them and give me 10% off.\n\n**Me:** We can not be responsible for information found on another website. Your options are to either sign up for an account and our newsletter for 10% off, or let me give you a code for 5% off which you can use as a guest.\n\n**DG:** I have tried a lot of discount codes and wasted a lot of time over this. If you are unwilling to honour any of the codes I found online, then I am unwilling to do business with you.\n\n**Me:** My offer for 5% now or 10% off when you sign up remains the same.\n\nThe customer disconnected with some impolite words and that was the end of Discount Guy for today.

        "text": "It’s been a long time since I have worked in a call centre, and it was calls like these which made me swear I would never go back. \n\nSeven years ago, when I was 20, I got a job in a call centre. It was a civil servant job for the big government department who deals with issuing welfare payments. Most calls were fairly straight forward, like adding a new child to a claim, telling us their income had increased, that they’d got a job etc. However, there was at least one call a day which just made the rest of your day miserable. This one sticks in my head the most. \n\nThe beep sounded in my headset to indicate another caller (I still have nightmares about hat sound). \n\nBefore I could even finish my greeting, the woman started screaming like a banshee that we were stealing her money. I managed to calm her down, talked her through security and accessed her claim. Right away I could see why her money had stopped. They money was a child welfare payment, and her child had now turned 20. \n\nMe: I believe I have found the issue. It appears that your son has now turned 20, and as he is no longer a child, you no longer qualify for this benefit. You would have been sent an award notice informing you of this a few weeks ago. \n\nBanshee Lady: No. you CANNOT do this. That is MY money!\n\nMe: Ma’am, the money you received was a welfare payment. You must have a child of qualifying age to qualify for the benefit. \n\nBL: I HAVE A CHILD AND YOU ARE STOPPING HIS MONEY. \n\nMe: A child must be under 20 for you to qualify for this benefit. \n\nBL: HE IS MY CHILD\n\nMe: I am not disputing the fact he is your child, but he is not A child for the purposes of receiving this payment. He is now an adult. \n\nBL: I cannot believe you would do this. You want me to die. I am going to go and hang myself and it will be personally your fault. I will do it with you on the phone. \n\n*i hear her stamping across the floor and some muffled noises. I start to genuinely panic that she is going to go through with it*\n\nMe: Maam, please, I am sorry that this has happened, please do not take any drastic measures. \n\n*I flag a supervisor who subsequently takes over the call*\n\nI never found out what happened but I do believe the supervisor flagged the issue as potential suicide and her information was passed to a team who could check on her. \n\nI get that it can be awful and horrific if your payments reduce, and I don’t pretend to understand how difficult and scary it can be. But that call scarred me for a very long time and I felt extremely guilty over something outwith my control. ",

        "text": "On phone, forgive formatting.  So, several years ago I spent one miserable year working at a call center that gave me a lifetime of stories. I was reminded of one today. So some context. \n\nThe call center I worked for had a contract with an American cell company. There has just been a buyout with another company.  The idea was to transition the accounts into our companies systems instead of waiting for people to change plans.  Which people didn't want to do because before the buyout the other company went on a loyalty drive and the rate plans they got were ridiculous. This becomes important later.  The transition was happening in stages and during the first stage there were exactly 4 teams handling these accounts for one market. \n\nWe were lured from our old teams by the $0.25/hr raise. It was not worth it.\n\nSo,  I ($ME) get a call from from Box Store Asshole ($BSA) about one of these accounts.  \n\n$ME:  HI, thank you for calling, this is m3m3t, how can I help?\n$BSA: Yeah, the system screwed up and I need to reverse an upgrade.\n$ME: Oh, you was me to put back the old phone on the account (thinking they had put a new SIM number in the account). I can do that for you but next time you can save time by... \n$BSA: No you idiot I need to revert the rate plan upgrade. The system won't let me.\n$ME:  You've already activated the upgrade? \n$BSA:  They decided that they don't want the phone (I can remember the exact reason, but weirdly enough, it had nothing to do with the rate plan) \n$ME:.... Hold please. \n\nRemember those ridiculous plans I mentioned? We had nothing like them, so when the accounts were transitioned they became READ-ONLY (RO) .  You can change the SIM card and personal account details but that's it.  \n\nI take a closer look at the account. Yup, there is the CLOSED indicator. For these accounts, a better word would be DEATH because it can't be undone without a court order.  I take a look at the now former rate plan. Unlimited calling and texts and data (this was back when unlimited plans didn't exist). The closest plan we has was $100+ and they were paying $30.  \n\nWanting to help the agent out, I put a call into retentions ($RET). LPT: threatening cancel will usually get you sent to retentions and they have offers that normal agents do t have access to. \n\n$ME:  hey $RET this is m3m3t, I can a $BSA that upgraded a RO and the customer wants to go back out. Do you have any offers that's close to what they have now? \n\n$RET:  Hahaha. You're kidding, right?  \n\n$ME: That's what I thought. Do me a favor and notate that on the account? \n\nWhat I'd done in the past is take the call with customer to explain exactly what happened and they're options. I was not required to and I took a hot on my call time number but my manager always backed me since it worked out best for everyone. \n\n$ME: Thanks for waiting... \n$BSA: How are you this bad at your job? I do this all the time! Just do your job. \n\nReally? Okay, I'll just do my job. \n\n$ME: .... Okay, do you have the account up on your screen. \n$BSA:  of course. \n$ME: I'm guessing in your hurry to get your commission you didn't read the account comments. In particular, the massive warning in caps that state this is a transitioned account.  And that upgrades can't be undone. You'll also see my notes and retentions notes that we have nothing of equal value to offer the customer. \n$BSA:..... What do I do...? (Here is where he realizes how fucked he is). \n$ME: I'm guessing someone just got a brand new phone. Is there anything else I can help you with today? \n\nTldr: agent didn't read notes on an account and was rude so now he has to explain to his boss why a customer was going to get a free phone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm still in call centers, but in a very different field from the one I started in.  I find it impossible to feel intimidated by my new day to day, though, when I think back to my very first call at my very first call center:\n\nI started on phone work with a company that sold third party contracts to major US companies.  This meant there was a 1/3 chance I'd end up doing tech support for tax software, online banking for a well-known veteran's bank, or selling computers and phones for a popular electronics retailer.  Since I could explain what a cookie was and how to connect a router in my interview, I ended up in that last group.\n\nThe real problem with our contract with Good Purchase was that they publicized the phone number to our team--a sales line--as their general \"we've got the answer!\" line.  This meant a lot of tech support questions from people who thought they'd called Nerd Crew, or from people who didn't want to pay Nerd Crew to fix their computers.  My first caller was one of these.\n\nHe'd bought a \"new\" computer, only to find it wasn't running as well as he'd hoped.  I discovered quickly the difference between \"new\" and \"new to me\"--it was an ancient Dell desktop that had come out in the range just after my first computer.  Eight years before.  At this point, I recommended more RAM, because the specs said he could expand a little, but I explained that not only was the type he needed so old that Good Purchase didn't sell it, this would be a stopgap that possibly extended the life of a very old, very obsolete computer perhaps another six months.  It was suggesting he save the money and buy a new device that broke the membrane of civility in him and let the pus of his real self out.\n\nC: I want to talk to someone else.  Anyone else.\n\nMe: Why?\n\nC: Because I do.  Get someone else on the line now.\n\nMe: Okay.  I have to ask why, though, since my supervisor won't take the call without a reason.\n\nC: It doesn't matter to you.  Hey, I want to ask you a question, though. \n\nMe: Yes?\n\nC: Did you graduate from an accredited four year university? \n\nMe: Er, yes, but personal questions--\n\nC: Because you sound like you went to fucking clown college.\n\nAt the time I was too stunned to laugh, and it took a little bit of time to get over the nerves after that, but now I wish I could demand satisfaction for professor McDonald's reputation; my certificate says I'm perfectly qualifies to flip those burgers, thanks!",

        "text": "One of the funniest calls I've gotten, though I don't know if my caller thought it was. \n\nI work for an airline. Got a call from someone who tells me they got on the wrong plane, and ended up in the wrong city. At first I'm a bit skeptical because, well, there are rules in place that typically prevent that.\n\nLet's just call my passenger Kevin.\n\nI bring up Kevin's ticket and nothing looks out of the ordinary. He has a flight from DCA to New York, which shows flown. Only Kevin claims he's in Raleigh, North Carolina and is upset that the airport personnel in Washington told him to get on the wrong plane.\n\nNow, a lot of things had to happen to get Kevin on this airplane. His family woke up late and were rushing to get through the airport during busy holiday travel, but also DCA has a lot of small planes that board on the tarmac.\n\nKevin's boarding pass was scanned inside, before he walked out onto the tarmac. He either misinterpreted or was pointed towards the wrong flight.\n\nBy some crazy chance, the flight Kevin ended up on didn't have anyone in the same number seat he was supposed to occupy.\n\nKevin states he donned his headphones soon after boarding and thus didn't hear the announcement about their destination.\n\nI didn't have access to the passenger manifest yet, which would presumably show Kevin on his intended flight anyways. So all I could really do is take his word for it, along with the circumstantial evidence. \n\nI mean, why would Kevin want to get to New York if he was already there? \n\nI rebooked him without charge. I called a supervisor to ask their advice. They also happened to be in RDU and just laughingly asked if he was trying to come see them.\n\nGood job, Kevin.",

        "text": "So I work in a third party call center, on a banking project of sorts. Simply put, we manage people's cards they get for whatever reasons. (Basically credit cards, but with different regulations than normal cards). One of the things we assist with is disputing fraudulent use and assisting the cardholder (CH) in re-securing their account and getting their funds back as quickly as possible. Typically, these calls will start because a CH checked their balance or recent transactions, and sees something they didn't expect (either less money, or unauthorized transactions, respectively). We will check their transactions, and give them information on where the transaction was attempted (we don't usually get a physical address, but we can see the name/partial name of the merchant, and the city they're in) and then ask, verbatim: \"Did you authorize those transactions?\"\n\nSo I was on one of these calls last week, and the charges she was calling about happened several times over the past week or so. They were charged to a certain online music service owned by a fruit based company. I tell her \"where\" and when the purchases were made and she says, \"I don't even have a *insert name of popular model of phone made by same fruit based company*!\" So I say my line, \"So Ma'am did you authorize those transactions?\" and she replies with, \"What do you think? I just told you I don't own one of them!\"\n\nNow, in our center, they put a heavy emphasis on certain situations in which we must get a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\". This is one of those situations.\n\n\"So ma'am, just to be clear: you did not authorize those transactions?\"\n\n\"What did I just say? NO!\"\n\n\"OK ma'am, then at this point, for the security of your funds, I will have to inactivate your account, and then I'll transfer you to our Research Department (see: Tier 2) who will assist you with the next steps to re-secure your account and help get you a new card sent out.\"\n\n\"Waitwaitwaitwait! Can I get the rest of my money out first?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am, but before you do anything, there is a method we use to immediately secure your funds before that. Our Research Department handles that procedure, so if you'd like to do that, I will leave your card active for now, and transfer you to another agent in that department, and they'll help you with how to do that, is that alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah, go ahead.\"\n\nSo, it's worth noting, the whole process for her situation would've been:\n\n* Talk to Tier 2\n\n* Tier 2 places a temporary block on the account\n\n* CH goes to an ATM, then calls back to Tier 2 from the location of the ATM\n\n* Tier 2 removes block, CH withdraws funds from ATM, Tier 2 inactivates the card\n\nFrom there, the process Tier 2 follows is basically the same as if the CH didn't want to get their funds out first.\n\nSo I place the CH on hold while I transfer myself to Tier 2. Tier 2 was a little busy, so it took maybe 3-4 minutes for an agent to get to me. I give them the account info so they can bring it up in their systems, brief them on the situation, and as soon as I tell them the CH wants to remove the funds before the card is inactivated, the Tier 2 agent says, \"What funds? There's $0.xx on this card?\" I explain to the agent that I show $xxx.xx funds on my screen, and ask if she is on the correct account? We confirm the CH's name and last four of card in question, and the Tier 2 agent asks me to refresh the page. As soon as it loads up, I see the new balance. The Tier 2 agent laughs as she realizes what must've happened. She checks the CH's recent transactions, and while the CH was on hold, they went to an ATM and got their money out, except for the few cents that was left. I laugh, and look at my screen for my call statuses, and I see that the CH is still waiting patiently on hold. I inform the Tier 2 agent of this, and ask how to proceed. I was advised to inactivate the card and complete the transfer. So that's exactly what I did! Really wish I could've stuck around and heard how that played out. \n\nAnyways, hope y'all enjoyed this tale, I'm sure it's pretty mild compared to those told by some call center veterans, but hey, I've only been on the phones a week! I've got more stories to share here eventually, but I have to be off to bed now. (Yay, crack of dawn shifts! /s)",

        "text": "So today I got not one but TWO calls that played out the exact same way. \n\n\nBackstory: I takes calls for FMLA so when you have fmla and need to miss work you call my company to report it (within a certain time frame usually 1-2 days depending on the employer) and we notify your employer if your absence was approved. \nAll our calls are recorded so if for some reason you called in an absence and it wasn’t in your file we can track down the call, listen to it and get it approved for you.  In order to track down the call we have to have the number you called from. (We get about 20,000 calls a day  about 4000 or so we are specifically fmla related)  \nIf someone calls in an absence we have to enter directly into the timekeeping system and document that the employee called in their absence. \n\nIn both of these calls today the absence wasn’t in the time keeping system or documented in the file that we even received a call from the employee that day.  \n\nI will be S, and caller will be IE - iresponsible employee \n\nStandard greeting and verification \n\nIE- I’m calling to check my abs from June 5th my employer doesn’t have an approval \n\nS- I’m sorry IE there is no record of you reporting an abs on that day in the file. I can send a research request to see if we can find the phone call when you (supposedly) called it in. \n\nIE- I REPORTED THE DATE. IT SHOULD BE IN THE FILE WHY DONT YOU DO YOUR JOB\n\nS- I would be happy to help you look into this I just have a few questions to go over with you to put in the request.\n\nIE- FINE \n\nS- when did you call? What was the date? \n\nIE- I don’t know\n\nS- okay do you have an idea when you might have called? \n\nIE- I don’t know but I definitely called it in.\n\nS- alright then, no problem we can search for the days around june 5th, what phone # did you call from? \n\nIE- I DONT KNOW BUT I KNOW I CALLED\n\nS-... okay well was it your cell phone or home phone? \n\nIE- IT WASNT MY CELL PHONE AND I WASNT HOME I CALLED FROM (random hotel because I wasn’t actually missing work for fmla but at some random hotel) \n\nS-  okay IE- we’ll what is the phone number you called from at the hotel? \n\nIE- I DONT KNOW THEIR NUMBER\n\n(I am so irritated by this point, I had actually asked these questions twice already and instead of answering IE kept repeating that we lost her absence blah blah blah and we was going to get her in trouble at work) \n\nS- okay IE we get over 20,000 phone calls a day. You don’t know when you called or even what # you called from or the time of the day it was. It going to be nearly impossible for us to track this call unless you know what the phone # you called from is. Based on the window you gave us we would have to review 80,000 phone calls to see if you called.  Can you call the hotel you stayed at and find out what the number is? \n\nIE- I can’t do that how are they suppose to know the number? \n\nS- IE call the hotel and ask them what their phone number is so we can see if we received a call from that number. \n\nIE- this is ridiculous IF I HAD KNOWN I NEEDED THE NUMBER I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT THEN\nYOU ARE NOT HELPFUL I WILL CALL BACK AND FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ME \n*click*\n\nI really doubt this lady actually called in that she missed work. Honestly I think she was lying and trying to blame it on us. If she really had spoken to someone in our call center the absence would have been entered DIRECTLY into our system. Once it’s in there it can’t be removed (even mistakes or cancelled abs remain in the file just moved from an “approved period” to an “error period”  AND it would have been documented in the history that someone took a call from her. \n\nI sent the research request anyway and wrote down the file so I can see what comes out of my research request. I just feel bad for the net agent that had to speak to her. \n\n",

Subscribers would place their orders, most of them had a credit line so we would ship the orders and payment was expected by the next scheduled date for an order (aligning with the next catalog). Some subscribers would place orders way below their credit line or had such good payment history that in some cases, a second order would ship without requiring a payment for three previous one.\n\nWhen I started there, subscribers had digital options to place orders and pay for them, but due to a large number of older users, we also had the option for them to mail in the order and a check, check could also be mailed separately. Also, since entering an email was optional, all the key information was sent through regular mail.\n\nOn one of my very first days I got this call. SUB will be the caller, and ME, well , me.\n\n- Me: generic greeting\n- Sub: I just got a collections letter in the mail!!!! And I have already paiiiid!! Why are you sending me this?\n- Me: I’m sorry about this, can you tell me the name on the company in the letterhead.\n- Sub: its Not-a-collections-agency inc\n- Me: ok Sub, that is not a collections letter, it is from our pre-collections department as you had a past due balance. However, I see that we received a payment on 04/25/2018 (not real date), so you can disregard the notice, your current balance is...\n- Sub: *cuts me off* why the hell then would you send a collections letter if you had a payment? This is a scam! You’re just trying to charge me double!!!!\n- Me: ma’am, your payment was due on 04/19/2018, since we didn’t receive a payment then, the letter was generated.

Why would you still send it?\n- Me: when did you mailed it ?\n- Sub: 04/20/2018\n- Me: ok, remember payments that are mailed in take 7-10 business days to reach us and be applied, that is why you still received the letter \n- Sub: but the payment was sent, why did I still receive the letter ?\n-  me: you sent your payment but there was no way for us to know this until we actually received it, so the letter was still generated and mailed. If you see the date on the letter , you can see when it was mailed.\n- Sub : but whyyyy would I still get the letter if i paiiid?\n- me: (tired at this point ) ma’am,  once you put something in the mail, there is no way of taking it back, the letter was sent even before you mailed in your payment. You can just ignore it as payment has been received.\n- Sub: ohhh I get it, you should had said that...",

I could not follow her conversation  but asked her about it after she hung up:\n\nThe customer called to book a seat on one of our ships. This ship had only limited seats and no standing areas which means, when all seats have had been booked we were not able to let any more passengers on the ship (similiar to a plane). On that particular day the ship was full since it was in the middle of the high season where customers usually booked several weeks or even months in advance to ensure their passage to the island. \n\nSo the man wanted a seat on the ship because he had to fetch his wife and daughter. My colleague told him that the ship was full and that there was nothing she could do for him. He started to freak out because it was very important to him to fetch his relatives. However, my colleague told him again and again (very politely and calmly) that there were no seats left and that the only possibility might be to go to the counter hoping another passenger would not show up. He would not agree that and became furious about her \"lack of cooperation\". \n\nAfter screaming at her that she lied to him and she was only too lazy to book a seat for him he told my colleague to cancel someone else's booking to get him a seat on that ship. After she said that she was not allowed to do that and even if she could, she would not do it because of his tone, he told her to get our supervisor on the phone to complain about her behaviour.\n\nShe said that since it was Sunday our supervisor would be back in the office the following day and that he is welcomed to talk to her in the morning. She gave him her phone number and name, wished him a nice Sunday afternoon and hung up.\n\nThe customer never called. We believed that he did not expected my colleague to give him the details of our supervisor. But since she reacted in the right way she was not afraid about the customer calling our supervisor.\n\nWe never found out whether he somehow managed it to get on that ship or not. ",

Your company keeps calling me to collect payment but I will never pay you! So just stop trying!\n\nI should mention at this point that I do not have access to any of our customer's customers information because that would be a pretty big breach. I also don't do things like run their cards, process payments, anything like that. I work directly with the software/studio owner, nothing to do with any of their customers.\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir but you will need to contact the studio and work this out with them. We are just the software provider and we cannot settle anything when it comes to payments\n\nI: Well that's too bad because it is your problem now. You made the software, so you can fix this!\n\nME: No, I really can't and I wouldn't even if I had the ability. That would be a major breach on the trust our customers have in our software.\n\nI: Well too bad, it is your problem now and it must be resolved today. Do your job code monkey! (Yep, he actually called me that... I don't even code...)\n\nAfter that they hung up so I basically just sat there kind of shocked that Code Monkey was a real insult and what I should do about this. So I called the studio, mentioned the guy's name and oy did they have plenty to say about him... Apparently he agreed to pay for a full year of his daughter's ballet classes but whenever they ran his card it would get declined because it was over $500 or something dumb. Basically, he kept coming to classes and kept saying he would take care of it until he finally had some outburst for something unrelated and they asked him to leave the studio, basically blacklisted him. They are still trying to collect payment for 2 months of lessons that he basically stole and he was trying to get me to stop the collections calls.\n\nTL;DR; Customer of my customer calls me and asks me to do something probably illegal, I say no, he gets pissed and calls me a code monkey",

        "text": "**Intro**\n\nSo here comes the other story I teased in [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/8wixwx/completely_uncalled_for_rant/) some days ago. 'Short' introduction: I worked in a inhouse inbound callcenter of a shipping company that offers tours to Heligoland (Island in the open sea in Germany).\n\nWhen people book their holidays, they think (nearly) about everything. How many duty free items they may take on their way back from the island, if dogs are allowed, why cars aren't allowed on that island, which train they have to enter to be on time, cost of the trip... you get the idea. But an important fact nearly always gets left out by first time customers: The tour could be cancelled due to bad weather conditions that lead to enormous waves. Open sea, remember?\n\nSo my little story is about such a first time customer on a day like that. A woman.\n\n**Story / Tale**\n\nThe greatly feared message, that none of our ships would start that day, arrived and we prepared for a stressful day, because that usually means a lot of cancellations with refund, booking changes, arguments why our ships wouldn't leave the port etc. and no single minute off, because there's ALWAY somebody on hold.\n\nThe seasoned passengers mostly knew the risk and always had alternative plans for those cases and were pretty relaxed. Others panicked and others were angry. The woman of this story was angry. (Because it was long ago I don't know everything in detail, but I'll try to recapitulate the dialogue.)\n\n**Me**: *saying standard greeting things and assuming she's calling because of the cancelled tour.*\n\n**She**: Why haven't you informed me much earlier?\n\n**Me**: We're very sorry, but the definitive decision is made by the captain and sometimes the weather / the waves change pretty quick. The only options we can offer to you are to cancel and refund the tour or to change your date of the trip - for free of course.\n\n**She**: Oh you just can't imagine what we're through right now. We booked many months beforehand and were so excited and we started our tour from the south of Germany today in the morning. And now that we finally reach our destination you tell us we can't go.\n\n**Me**: I really can imagine that and you must believe me: We really are sorry and we also wish those days would never come.\n\n**She**: And what do we do now? Can you book us a hotel to stay at?\n\n**Me**: No ma'am, I'm sorry, I can't. There are only the aforementioned two options.\n\n**She**: I am really pissed off right now. You call that service? Who do you think you're talking to? The weather is fine, I don't understand that. And my app tells me the waves aren't that high.\n\n*... and this went on for about a minute or two. She was stubborn and didn't accept my answers. So I decided to get more clear.*\n\n**Me**: Now listen, ma'am. The point is: The captain has to make a decision. Let's say the app said a risky 3m *(that was the maximum height of waves our ships could handle without damage)* in the early morning and the captain decides to start anyway. You're mid travel when the weather gets worse and a big wave hits the front windows, they shatter and everyone panics and gets wet. In the worst case the ship sinks. Do you really want to experience that instead of a nice trip? I don't think so! So to be on the safe side and don't risk our customers lives the captain decided to stay in port.\n\n*I literally hear how hear brain works...*\n\n**She**: You're right. I am sorry. It's just that we were so excited and we don't have a place to stay.\n\n**Me**: Like said: I really can understand your frustration and how this ruins your holiday. But I can only offer you the cancellation or the change in booking. And to find a place to stay I can offer you a phone number of the tourism center on site. That's all I can do.\n\nNow she was cooperative and we could accomplish the cancellation and she got all the money back. I didn't really like to raise my voice, because she already had a very bad day. But to find a solution to get forward and not piss her off completely I did my best to let her know, that this was the lesser of two evils.",

What proof am I meant to fucking give?!\n\nAnd this is where the conversation completely derailed.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Well sir, *obviously* if you sold a car there'd be paper trails. And if it was online, there'd be trails of the postage. Or do you not have those either and it was an in-person sale?\n\n&gt; **DB**: Excuse me!! I don't like your tone!. Put me through to someone else. There's no need to be disrespectful. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Okay. Just a moment.\n\nSo I put him through to another colleague. Which turns out didn't go well for him. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Hey **AC** it's Peace. I need someone to take over this call as per customer's request. Was wondering if you could help. \n\n&gt; **AC**: Ah that's okay. What's the situ?\n\n&gt; **ME**: Well apparently it's disrespectful to tell customer's what they need to provide for evidence in regards to credit into the account. When I told him that he'd obviously have sufficient proof if he sold his car online or even in person. \n\n&gt; **AC**: Oh,what an absolute [redacted]. Okay pass this guy through. I'll keep you updated. \n\nTurns out he accepted AC's advice (which was exactly the same). Honestly, I think I've had just about enough of this damn job. These customer's just a) not letting us do our damn job and b) not knowing how to fucking bank. In 2018! So want a new job, but I don't really way to start from the bottom of the ladder. Again. And if you take one lesson away from this tale let it be that reading T&amp;C's is important. ",

She says that she works for a non-profit and we are very charitable to her non- profit, but she was going to make sure that her board of directors know how shitty we have treated her.  And i can only think of what impact she is trying to have by that “threat”.

One of my coworkers, Scott left the company in October. Then in December he had a massive coronary and died. This call came through about six months later.\n3. Our customer accounts are split into six different groups. Two of the groups use specialized administrative software I'm not familiar with, but one of *those* groups is handled elsewhere, so the actual number of customers we have to deal with that require that software is extremely small; we *might* get a call from one of these once every month or two. Getting me trained on this software is not a priority, their issue can usually wait. \n\nI will be \"Me\", customer will be \"C\".\n\nC: I just put through a withdrawal. Reverse it.\n\nMe: I can't.\n\nC: Just do it.\n\nMe: I can't.\n\nC: DO IT, AND F*{&lt;ING HURRY UP ABOUT IT!\n\nMe: I literally can't. We have two kinds of accounts, yours happens to use specialized administrative software I'm not familiar with.\n\nC: Come on, just reverse it.\n\nMe: You're not listening to me. I can't; I don't know how.\n\nC: Transfer me to someone else.\n\nMe: I'm alone, there's no one else to transfer you to.\n\nC: Put Scott on the phone.\n\nMe: I just told you, I'm alone.\n\nC: Put Scott on the phone.\n\nMe: Again, I'm alone. Also, Scott no longer works here.\n\nC: Put Scott on the phone. He knows how to do this.\n\nMe: I can't put Scott on the phone, he's not here, he no longer works here, and he's dead!\n\nC: Stop screwing around and put Scott on the phone.\n\nMe: You're not listening to me! I'm alone. There's nobody else in the office at the moment. Just me. Scott left the company last October, and he had a massive coronary and died in December. Scott's dead; I can't put him on the phone.\n\nC: What? No... you're kidding.\n\nWe ended up talking for a good 20 minutes after that, reminiscing about Scott.  He kept saying, \"Dude, I can't believe Scott's dead.\"",

        "text": "This call will be one of the funniest ones I remember, and just purely because of the karma this lady got. So I work in a call centre for a cruise company, we don’t get complaints too often but when we do... they are angry!\n\nThis lady phones because she hasn’t received her little pack of luggage labels. I check and she’s opted in for ‘Go green’, which of course means she ain’t getting it through the post. She would have pressed this big green button online that says ‘Opting in for go green means all documents are online only and will not be sent via post’. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE BLIND TO MISS IT BASICALLY.\n\nI have more sympathy for older passengers in their 70’s/80’s as they’re not used to computers. This lady was 34 right...\n\nSo anyway, I’ll be Me and the lady on the phone will be Dumb bitch (DB).\n\nMe: Generic phone intro\n\nDB: I’m going on my cruise in 2 weeks and I haven’t received my luggage labels!\n\nMe: Okay not a problem let me take a look...(realises she’s opted in for go green).\nIt looks as though you have opted in for go green and chosen to have online documents only, unfortunately I cannot resend these as we need at least 21 days to send these to you.\n\nDB: I never opted in for that! Your lying! I didn’t touch anything on my booking, you’re just trying to save on money!! I WANT MY LUGGAGE LABELS NOW\n\nMe: I’m happy to print and send you paper copies, but they won’t be like the ones that get sent to you as those are hard copies. \n\nDB: I want to speak to your manager, they will send me some out!\n\nMe: Unfortunately, my manager will say the same thing. They do not have the ability to get these to you any faster than the standard time.\n\nDB: YOUR SO UNHELPFUL YOU FUCKING DUMB ASS BITCH CUNT!\n\nMe: Oh my god \n\n**DB Hangs up phone**\n\nSo of course I speak to my manager and explain it all, she listens to the call and has to write it out as a script to pass over to the Complaints manager. Because this lady hung up midway as I was saying ‘Oh my god’ the script looked as follows:\n\nDB: YOUR SO UNHELPFUL YOU FUCKING DUMB ASS BITCH CUNT!\n\nMe: Oh my...\n\nThis made me laugh harder.\n\nSo anyway to end this beautiful story, the other manager calls the lady to tell her that she is in fact not welcome to cruise with us again, we will be cancelling her booking down as we do not want her on board our ships. AND... she is now blacklisted so if she tries to book again she will be denied booking...HAHAHA karma is a BITCH. \n\nHer response was begging my manager she was sorry and that she didn’t mean it whilst blubbering uncontrollably down the phone. \n\nThe manager: Nope.... too late \n\nLOVE IT 😍 \n\n",

For context reasons you need to know that both me and client are Canadian.\n\nSo I work in credit card activations and as a secondary responsibility ai also sell the bank's crappy credit card insurance. This story is actually about a woman that I had successfully convinced to take the insurance. When I sell to a client I'm required to play a recording for them that outlines the limitations and exclusions of the insurance. Because the bank outsources some of its insurance products to other companies one of the lines in this recording is \"Your information may be processed and stored in the United States\"\n\nMe: (after playing L&amp;Es) Client's name, do you consent and agree to enroll based on the terms that I have provided?\n\nClient: I change my mind, I don't want the insurance.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, for feedback purposes is there a specific reason why?\n\nClient: I heard that bit about the US and I don't want my information anywhere near those pricks! That Trump psycho is going to kill us all and I'll be damned if I support anything American while he's around!\n\nThus begins my struggle not to laugh while on the call because damn this lady was passionate. Technically I was suppose to rebuttal her because this actually is a common objection and we do have a scripted rebuttal for it, but I do sympathize with her so I didn't. Plus she was so adamant and angry that I was honestly a little scared of what she would have done if I had rebuttaled, she probably would have lost her shit.",

        "text": "Hey guys! I'm new to this sub, but I'd like to tell you a story of a caller I had to deal with several years ago, when I worked for a shipping company that offered tours to Heligoland. (I am from Germany -&gt; sorry, when my grammar may not be completely right.)\n\nThe call-centers purpose was to deal with bookings, changes in bookings, confirm bookings and so on. In short: Inbound only. I am a very polite person and am able to stay calm. I never had to hang up a call and could sometimes even calm upset callers (maybe I'll do another post for the one I have in mind). But then there was this one older man.\n\nRemember: He called to do a booking. So he called us, I greeted and we talked about the travel data. I chose a seat for him on the catamaran (like with airlines) and wanted to proceed to get his personal data, which were necessary, because we needed complete data if something should go wrong with the prepayment. I noticed how he kind of moaned because of that and how his mood became worse. We just finished first name, last name, address, city and email as I wanted to write down the mobile number in the next step. FYI: The only purpose for this number was to inform the customer in cases when the catamaran won't leave the port because of too high waves etc. And that was something I wanted to tell the caller too, but never got the chance.\n\nSo I asked for his mobile number and he started screaming into the phone what I needed this info for and why everyone is collecting so much data and totally freaked out. I was very surprised by this reaction and my heart rate increased by about 1000&amp;#37; :D\n\nI waited until he was done with his first round and wanted to tell him the purpose (mentioned above) for transparency and so on but I wasn't nearly halfway done when he began his second round and screamed so loud, that I couldn't even understand anything because of the distortion caused from his telephone (over-modulation).\n\nUpset like I was I told him pretty clear and loud, that I'd only continue his booking if he'd finally calm down and treat me like a normal person. Of course he didn't. That was the moment I decided to tell him loudly - whether he might hear it or not during screaming - to book his tour at the counter in a passive aggressive tone that said \"go fuck yourself\" in a subtle way and smashed the button to hang up the call.\n\nI deleted the booking completely, because we were not allowed to book a catamaran tour without payment information (even if it was possible) and I didn't even reach that point because of his rant. And somehow the deletion satisfied me, because I knew that the counter would be pretty crowded (good weather = high season) and the catamaran was booked pretty well on those days he wanted to do the trip. So the chance to book a spontaneous trip at the counter would be very low.\n\nAlthough I felt satisfied I wasn't able to answer calls the next five to ten minutes because I was so friggin upset by that a-hole :D",

        "text": "A little background first. I work as a customer service and technical support representative for a small-ish ISP in the Midwest US. Midwest nice is awesome when you are in person, but it doesn't translate over the phone. Either customers are genuinely nice or they are fucking assholes. I am trained in every service we have and I take chats and calls, so I deal with a lot of stupid during the day. We recently had Pricing and Service Adjustments (like many companies) and prices increased for some customers, but we also increased their internet speeds! This story is obviously about someone who is mad about our recent PSA.\n\nSo, here it goes! \n\nMe, is obviously me, but DB will be the douche bag customer.\n\nDink and a chat pops in. He isn't the account holder, but he is authorized. Thank GOD. \n\nDB: I can't access my online account.\n\nMe to myself: Oh, this is easy. Boop Boop Buttons, it was just locked. I unlocked it. It honestly should be working now.\n\nMe: Alright, DB. I would be glad to help. Can you please verify your information for me?\n\nDB: Blah, Blah, Blah.\n\nMe: Thank you for verifying that information. It looks like it was just locked, but I've got it unlocked for you. Would you be able to try again?\n\nDB: Yea, it's working.\n\nMe: Alright, that's awesome. I am glad that it is working for you. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nDB: Yea, can you tell me why my bill went up $10?\n\nMe to myself: Are you fucking kidding me? This was going to be easy and here it goes down hill.\n\nMe: I would be glad to help with that, let me just take a look at your most recent billing statement. \n\nDB: I'm supposed to be locked in a promotion.\n\nMe to myself: Your bill went up like everyone else's because we increased the internet speed by 25 mbps and your local broadcast channels want more money. Your promotion didn't change.\n\nMe: Oh, it looks like your bill went up by $9.19. $4 was because we made some changes to our packages during our Price and Service Adjustments and $5.19 was because your Local Broadcast Re-transmission fee went up. That fee goes straight to your local ABC, NBC, and other affiliates. Your offer is still in place, as promised.\n\nDB: So you can just raise my price without me asking for it?\n\nMe: DB, the offer is still in place. We slightly increased the price because we increased the internet speeds in each package for everyone. We are trying to improve service for everyone.\n\nMe to myself: You know, it isn't really that big of a fucking deal. It's $9 dollars and you are getting better service. Half of it isn't even our fault. \n\nDB: SO YOU CHANGED MY SERVICE WITHOUT ASKING ME? \n\nMe: Everyone's service level changed, DB.\n\nDB: Well, I want to talk to a supervisor.\n\nMe: Alright, I would be glad to set up for a supervisor to give you a call. \n\nMe to myself: Fucking Fucking Aye. Alright. Boop Boop Buttons, typing an email to my supervisors with anger.\n\nDB: The service sucks and now you are charging me more.\n\nMe: Oh, well I am sorry to hear that. I would be glad to help address those service issues while you are waiting for a supervisor to give you a call. \n\nMe to myself: Oh my god, he chatted in on 6/25 for service issues and refused any help... Whoopie!\n\nDB: I don't need your help, I'm a network administrator and I know that the problem isn't with my router. \n\nMe: It looks like you had spoken with us on 6/25 for some service issues and refused to work with us. We unfortunately have a system for how things work and we need to have a technician come to your house to take a look.\n\nDB: The last time I had a technician out I had to explain the difference between ISP and TP.\n\nMe to myself: Internet Service Provider and Toilet Paper? Hahaha.\n\nMe: Well, I am sorry to hear that, but we have to rule out any issues with equipment, wiring, or something outside your home. In order to do that we need to do basic troubleshooting or have a technician come out.\n\nDB: All they are going to do is run a speed test from your website to Sioux Falls where the website is hosted and gives inaccurate data.\n\nMe: I am not exactly sure what the technician will do, it is up to the technician when he gets there.\n\nDB: It doesn't matter, I just want it fixed. \n\nMe: Alright, well the only way to do that is to follow the steps we have set in place. I have that supervisor call back set up. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nDB: No, but when will the supervisor call me?\n\nMe: As soon as one is available.\n\nDB: Whatever. The service sucks, you guys can't fix your shit, and you are over charging me.\n\nMe: I am sorry that you feel that way, if you'd like you can speak with our Sales department by phone until 8 PM to make changes to your services and see if we can get you into the best package.\n\nDB: I just don't understand why you can't fix the issue, it is on your end.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, we need to follow our policy in order to get the issue fixed. I've got that call back set up and you should be hearing from a supervisor soon. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nDB: No, you haven't done much anyway.\n\n  \nHe then proceeded to leave the chat open for another 5 minutes. Our policy is to not disconnect from a chat or call and let the customers do it. I waited 5 minutes, but was so frustrated that I just disconnected without a care.\n\n  \nTL;DR Customer calls in, complains endlessly, and never gets his problem resolved because he is \"smarter than us\".

Like most places in America, our warranty doesn't cover lost or stolen items, but sometimes supervisors can be nice and throw folks a free game or credit to the online store if they feel the situation warrants it. However, there's nothing we hate more than someone who's gotten one of these exceptions and comes back and demands we do it again.\n\nEnter entitled 14 year old (E14)\n\nE14: hi yeah I lost my copy of Very Popular Game, you guys gave me some credit to buy the dlc last year so now you have to replace the game for me. Just send the download code to my email. \n\nMe: *I double check his account and yep, we sure did* Well, our warranty doesn't cover lost items unfortunately, and if we gave you something like that previously, that was a special one time thing. We wouldn't be able to give you a free replacement\n\nE14: excuse me? I've been waiting to get to an agent for half an hour, and I NEED a replacement!\n\nI'm a bit taken aback at this, I don't often get kids pulling the \"compensate me for making me wait\" shtick. This goes back and forth a few times, the kid getting more annoyed.\n\nE14: I have my receipt! I can prove I bought it!\n\nMe: And while that's all fine and good, there's not much we can do with that. We have no way of knowing if you gave it to a friend or sold it.\n\nE14: I need a way to get this game digitally, now!!\n\nMe: Well, you could always buy it on our online store\n\nE14: This is unreasonable, send me to your supervisor.\n\nI laugh at this internally, as I'm normally a supervisor myself, but this day I'm doing tier 1 calls. I comply with the request and send him right up. To my delight, my coworker sitting behind me gets him. He'll be SU. \n\nSU: Hello, so I hear you're looking to get a replacement for your lost copy of Very Popular Game?\n\nE14: Yes! You guys gave me credit before so I know you can do this for me. I need a way to play the game again! I have a copy of my receipt and everything!\n\nSU: Okay, and where is this receipt from?\n\nE14: Gamestop\n\nSU:  Alright, now have you tried going back to gamestop, shown them your receipt and try to get them to give you a new one?\n\nE14: What? No, why would I do that, they wouldn't do that.\n\nSU: Then why would we?\n\nThere was a long pause, and then we get the glorious sound we all hope for on difficult calls:\n\n*click*",

        "text": "This happened today.\n\nI work for a financial institution.\n\nCustomer calls in all upset because he couldn't withdraw a large amount (over $1400) in a cash withdrawal from his credit card. Our cards do let customers do cash withdrawals but not necessarily large ones. It depends on what your limit is and other factors too.\n\nThis customer purchased new windows, they were already installed and the company was understandably expecting payment. For whatever reason the company didn't take credit cards, only cash.\n\nThe customer was begging/whining/threatening me to somehow give him the $1400 he needed. He was able to withdraw up to $400 in cash using his card but there is absolutely no way that I can change our systems and somehow make it so his card can magically withdraw $1400. I apologized for the situation and explained to him why he's not going to be able to withdraw $1400 from our card.\n\nOf course he wanted a supervisor. I was happy to transfer him and be done with him! No idea what the supervisor told him, hopefully the same thing I told him.\n\nOccasionally customers do think ahead and call us BEFORE they need to do a large cash withdrawal or make a large purchase. Then at least we can advise them about it. But soooo many people don't--hence the title of this post!!\n\n\n",

There is one call that still bothers me to this day about how absolutely crazy it was.\n\nThis call was actually a transfer to me from our external tech support line.  The rep was rather nice.  I will be Me, TR will be the Tech Rep, and D will be the douche-y customer.\n\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nM: Thank you for calling this is SuperReekon, can I have your name please?\n\nTR: Hi SuperReekon, I am TechRep and I have a customer named Douche on the other line.  He has called in to Tech Support multiple times about his device and wants to know what can be done about getting his phone replaced.\n\nM: Huh, well he has had the device less than 6 months, and has insurance as well.  What is wrong with the phone?\n\nTR: The device updated to Android 8 and he doesn't like it.  He wants a new phone.\n\nM: Yeah, he still owes over 700 dollars on the device he currently has... so unless he is paying that off, that is the only way to get a new phone.  If there is a defect, you guys can replace it or he can file an insurance claim.  However in both options that do not involve him paying 700 dollars, he's gonna run into the same issue.  The device is going to update.\n\nTR:  I told him that too, but he wanted to talk to customer service.\n\nM: Okay, I guess, send him on in.\n\nTR: Sure.\n\nThe tech rep conferences the call\n\nTR: Hi there, thank you so much for holding Douche, this is SuperReekon, from customer service and he will be taking over this call.  Have a wonderful day!\n\nM:  Hello Douche, so TechRep was telling me what was going on.  I see that your device updated to the newest software and you are not a fan of it?\n\nD: Correct, and I have been on the phone with Tech Support, the manufacturer of the phone, and now you and I need to get this fixed NOW or I am changing carriers.\n\nM: Well I am sorry you feel that way, but the issue is... there isn't one.  Your phone is working perfectly fine, it isn't damaged, and all of our warranty replacements will be the same phone. \n\nD: That sounds like YOUR problem doesn't it?  I want a new phone.\n\nM: Then you have to pay off your old one and you can upgrade to a new one.\n\nD: If I have to spend a single cent for this I am going to [competitor]\n\nM: If you do that, you are welcome to, however you still need to pay off your phone.\n\nD: So are you a rep of this company telling me the only solution to my issue is to go to [competitor]??  I will be calling corporate about this.\n\nM: I in no way suggested that.  I am telling you no matter what you have to finish paying off your current phone before you can get a new one, and blaming the phone company for an update that is put through by the phone manufacturer is not going to help anything.  IF you  changed companies, the other carrier would have the exact same issue.\n\nD:  I want a supervisor.\n\nM: I would happily get you one, but they have all gone home for the day.  I can have a supervisor call you when they get in tomorrow morning, if that is okay?  I am letting you know now that they won't be able to do anything for you in regards to this.  Best I can offer you is to waive your upgrade fees if you want to buy out your phone.\n\nD: Nope, still want a supervisor.\n\nSO I go though the process of setting up a call back with my supervisor in the morning.  I explain to him what is going on, but first pull up his account to give the information to him.  The customer had called in 2 more times after talking to me and the other reps gave him the same story.  He then contacted Executive Relations about my conduct (He claimed I called him a bunch of slurs relating to his sexuality beginning with the letter F) and they reviewed the call.  Because I was nothing but professional and obviously did not call him any of those things, I did not get in trouble.  Out of curiosity, I checked his account a week later to see if he ever got his phone replaced.  \n\nHe called in and apparently threatened a rep.  So his service was immediately terminated.  Glad he isn't our problem anymore.",

        "text": "So this happened to me around a month ago. I work at a call center where I do billing for an insurance company. I explain the bill to agents so they can explain the bill to their insureds.\n\nSo I'm doing some overtime, and I get a rather interesting call later on in the day from an agent who had an interesting take on my breathing patterns. (Side Note: I am a hefty guy, however my breathing is not usually that loud or heavy, and the headset I use is not *that*  sensitive to sound.)\n\nSo Me will be Me and LB will be Light Breather.\n\nMe: *Intro Plays*\n\nLB: *Miscellaneous background noise for about 30 seconds.*\n\nMe: Hello?\n\nLB: Hello? Who is this?\n\nMe: *Reiterates intro, verifies agent*\n\nI knew from the awkward beginning that this would be a weird call that I would try my best to end as swiftly as possible. Turns out, the request she had wasn't difficult at all, just a simple name change on the billing accounts, as the insured's were flipped on the bills. I figured I had my chance to get her off of my line as soon as possible. I was *so* wrong. \n\nMe: Okay, ma'am, no problem! I will take care of this as soon as possible. \n\nLB: *After about 30 seconds of silence* **CAN I ASK WHY YOU'RE BREATHING SO HEAVY?**\n\nMe: ..... I'm sorry?\n\nLB: **I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY YOUR BREATHING IS SO DEEP AND LOUD. HAS NOBODY TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE?**\n\nMe: No, ma'am, I haven't received complaints about my breathing before.\n\nLB: Well, I don't know what your problem is, but you breathe really heavy.\n\nShe then proceeds to mimic how she thinks my breathing sounds.\n\nMe: I do apologize ma'am, would you like me to put you on hold or mute you while I take care of your issue?\n\nLB: No I just want to know *why* you're breathing so heavy. What is your reason?\n\nThis proceeds to me trying to make up reasons for my supposed heavy breathing so that we can move on from the subject, as I've already completed her request at this point. However, she is not taking the bait on anything.\n\nMe: I'm sorry ma'am, I just finished eating, I think I'm a bit full. That could explain the reason possibly?\n\nLB: No, that's not it. I just finished lunch before calling you and you don't hear me doing that, so why are you doing it?\n\nI even offered to stop breathing at this point just to keep my cool and entertain this woman's crazy obsession. Nothing deterred her. The reasons continued until I had enough.\n\nMe: Well ma'am, I'm sorry but I finished your issue, so now you don't have to listen to my loud breathing anymore.\n\nLB: Well thank you, I appreciate it. But seriously, why do you breath so loud?\n\nMe: Have a good day, ma'am. \\**click*\\*\n\nI know this reads like a cringefest, and honestly that's what it felt like the whole time. Does anybody else have off calls like this, where everything is just upside down for the entire duration of the call? By the way, this is my first time posting something this length, so please be gentle.",

If someone asks about the purchases APR, I have to read the one for the balance transfers first, because that’s how it’s written. If someone is retired or a homemaker, I have to read this gross annual income script asking about their salary. If someone cuts me off during the opening, I can’t ask if they want to apply for a credit card (they might have a question or want to be taken off the mailing list). This guy called to apply for a joint card with his daughter who’s in college, so to save him having to go through the whole thing I asked if she was 21 or older, as anyone younger can’t apply over the phone. I’m probably not allowed to do that since it’s not in the script. They’re so busy worrying about the script they don’t leave any room for common sense or saving their precious customers time. Heck, we can’t even acknowledge if someone’s birthday is on the same day! \n\nIf a caller has a thick accent, or rattles off their information quickly, we get marked off for asking them to repeat at all more than once. They correct us on every tiny thing and they want perfection at all times. It used to be 90 QAs were okay, then it was 95, now the sup is trying to bribe us with pizza to get to a 97.\n\nDoing well here means being a robot. I try to work hard, but when I do I get points off for thinking too much. I’m looking for a new job, I’m just frustrated today. \n\nTL;DR- I am not allowed to be a human. I must become a machine.",

        "text": "I work at a prestigious bank that is one of the top student loan lenders in the nation. I was recently promoted and now have to work our \"escalation line.\" \n\nI received a call recently that I just can't seem to get over. As most of us know, crippling student loan debt is never fun... The golden rule with student loans is to never take out more than what your annual salary will be. For example, if you are going to be an Art major, making maybe 25k a year, you probably shouldn't take out 100k in student loans at a private university in Downtown Minneapolis. \n\nOn to the tale.\n\nHop onto the escalation line, typically I only have to work this line 2 hours of my 8 hour day, and a \"sup\" call comes in. The rep tells me they have tried to explain that we can't refinance this customers loan in his name only, over and over again:\n\nMe: Good afternoon customer, I hear you are curious about the decision on your refinance, how can I help you today. \n\nCus: Hello, yes I am, I have 80k in private student loans through you guys and I'm trying to refinance them in my name and you people won't let me. \n\nMe: Sure! Well let's take a look at your situation and I'll see if I can explain the decision more clearly. I see your 6 Student Loans with us all have two cosigners on them. So, it looks like we are willing to move forward on your refinance; however, you are still going to need a cosigner to move forward. \n\nCus: I know... that's what the last person told me. But, how do you expect me to move out of my parent's house when I have an $800 private student loan payment to make every month. \n\n***I will take this time to explain the situation more clearly***\n\nThis particular customer is a 25 year old Male who payed 80k just in private student loans for a Biology degree. For private student loans we do a Inquiry on the customer's credit and are able to see pretty much everything about them. We also gather all their income information to make an informed decision on if the customer is able to afford the payments or not. So, I took a look at the customers current income and credit profile a little deeper as he was explained his situation to me. \n\nThis customer's student loans went into repayment in December of 2017. In September of 2017 this customer went and bought a $18,000 vehicle, and also has 1 bank credit card that is almost maxed out, and 3 retail credit card that are almost maxed out as well. \n\nLet's do some math: This individual has a $300 car payment and almost the same in credit card minimum monthly payments as well. So, almost $600 in debt that he has chosen to take on. He also has several Federal loans on his credit report as well, which totals to an additional $300 monthly payment, and of course, our payment. \n\nRemember how I said we also take income information? This customer is working at a small biotech company in the Midwest and making roughly $16 an hour. Not only do credit factors account for a large portion of an approval for a refinance, but Debt-to-Income Ratios (DTI) do as well. That means this customer is making roughly $2500 a month after taxes. Which would make his DTI around 55%. To be approved for a loan of 80k, you would have to have above a 700 FICO score and lower than a 40% DTI. Did I forget to mention that this customer has a 670 FICO score... My bad.\n\n***Back to the call***\n\nMe: Right, well I hear your frustration, that must be a difficult situation to be in. I'm around your age and I'm going through some similar struggles you are. It can be hard to try and make it these days with those student loan payments to make. However, to give you some perspective, your student loans all have 2 cosigners on them, in addition to yourself. We have decided that in order to move forward with a refinance of your students loans we are going to need to continue to have a cosigner on them. The risk would be too high to move forward with you by yourself on 80k of student loan debt. \n\nCus: Well, that doesn't make any sense!!! I've been making the payments all by myself for the last year with no help from those cosigners, so how do you explain that. \n\nMe: That's great! I'm glad you've been able to keep up on the payments so far; however, we are not able to justify removing your cosigners on that principal alone. We must take into account all the credit and income factors and make a decision from there. In your case you do not meet the eligibility requirements on your own. Does that make sense?\n\nCus: No!!! I've been with your bank for years. Are you really going to tell me that you, my bank, aren't going to help me out of this situation and help me move out of my parent's house?!\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, it's just not that simple, we take into account all of the factors I've mentioned. Your continued relationship is important to us, and I thank you for that; however, in order to move forward we will need to explore that cosigner option. \n\nCus: Well just so you know, one of the cosigners on those loans has died, and the other one is now retired and on a fixed income. Therefore, she can not afford to cosign again. \n\nMe: OK... I hear what you're saying, and I'm very sorry for your loss. But that cosigner is already liable for the 80k, so it's not like they would be taking out any additional student loans. You would just be refinancing the loans you already have. \n\nCus: Well... that is not an option. \n\nMe: Alright, well, again, at this point that is the decision that has been made. \n\nCus: Alright... well then I guess I will have to explore options at other banks and see if someone else is willing to help me. \n\nMe: OK, well shopping around is always encouraged. I wish you the best of luck. If you don't find anything else we will be here waiting for your cosigner. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nCus: Nope.\n\nMe: Alright! Well it was a pleasure speaking with you customer, I hope you have a great day. Let us know if you have any other questions. Thank you for your time. \n\nCus: Oh wait, do you know of any other banks that will be able to help me?\n\nMe: Ummm, yea, great question. So let me make sure I heard you right, you are asking me if I know if any of our competitors that would be willing to refinance your student loans in your name only?\n\nCus: Yes.\n\nMe: Well unfortunately sir, I don't have any recommendations for you. But again, if you need anything else, you let us know. \n\nCus: Whatever ***disconnects***\n\nMoral of this tale. Please make informed decisions around borrowing student loans. Get as many scholarships and grants as you can. Speak with your Financial Aid Office, and for god sake... Don't go buy a new car before your loans come into repayment. \n\nI think the thing that got me the most out of this interaction is the fact that I could hear this customer driving his car throughout the whole conversation. It took every fiber of my being to not suggest that he move out of his parents house and live in his brand new car, lol!\n\nThis post is much longer than I intended, and I don't think many people will read it, but hopefully I can shed some light on the current student loan crisis that is happening for even one person, and help put it all into perspective. \n\nTL;DR don't take out more student loans than your annual salary\n\n",

        "text": "Hello again from the land of life insurance! Recently there was a change in how we handle taking bill payments over the phone. The government has declared that we are no longer allowed to take debit or credit card numbers over the phone verbally.  \n\n\nThis is becoming more of a problem than I expected it to be. \n\n\nCallers are still able to use the automated system to put their numbers into the phone,  but we've got a lot of older clients who hate messing with that, as well as younger clients who don't want to spend minutes dealing with a slow IVR. To compound the issue, there is a long number they have to put into the system that is usually found on the bill. If they lose it or don't have it we have a method to find it that takes a few AHT-hurting minutes... and even after that the automated system kicks them right back to us because they are being charged multiple months for being behind or because they wanted to pay multiple months in advance.\n\n\nSo, when they land back with us it becomes a vicious cycle: they either give in and use banking information, they get transferred back to the automated system to try again, or it becomes an argument. As with any other change, I get to hear a lot of \"I've been paying like this for years, why is it a problem now?\" and \"Your company is the worst and this is so confusing!\"\n\n\nWhat is there to be confused about? We just need to use different numbers to get the same money from your bank account. Find a check, pull it up online,  do whatever, or just mail it in if you don't want to deal with it anymore! We could also set up automatic bank draft so you don't have to worry about it anymore... usually the callers tell us they don't have a bank account when we offer autopay. While they're trying to pay us with a bank debit card.\n\n\nI don't even know what the purpose of the change was. We're just taking a different kind of number that gives access to your money now...\n\n\ntl;dr My easiest call type just became the hardest, most aggravating call type in the name of security theater.

My story is a bit different since I never took many calls beyond the sup calls my agents would escalate to me. I hung  in there for the pay and benefits, but I finally felt like my hand was  forced to quit my job about a month ago.  \n \n\nI've felt put off by the metrics our organization uses for awhile now.  The handling time goals we use are exorbitantly high and seem based on  optimal call time rather than realistic call time, as the ideal call  lengths we use internally for each call type don't account for any  additional time that the customer may use up asking questions or  fetching information.  \n \n\nMy agents literally combat this by advising customers to call back or to  use self-service options, basically engineering valid ways to close calls prematurely so that  they can maintain a low handling time. Their choice to do this is no  fault of their own, as the company has made their metrics their top  priority, such that actually ASSISTING a customer feels like an incidental outcome rather than the goal of the call.  \n \n\nTo wit, quality is another metric agents are scored on, and is the  closest indicator as to whether or not an agent helped a customer  successfully. However, in a month's time, the agent's quality is scored  on \\*LESS THAN 1&amp;#37; OF THEIR CALLS\\*, yet this metric comprises a 25&amp;#37;  weighted value on their scorecard.  \n \n\nI mention quality and AHT in particular as it was the balancing act  between these two metrics that cost one of my best agents her promotion.  During a billing call, she turned off a customer's autopay the day  before payment was scheduled so that the gentleman could update his  billing info with a new card. He did not have his information ready, as  his new card was with his wife, so she recommended a self-service option  to him to update his info and enroll himself back into automatic  payments.  \n \n\nSimple enough of a call, but QA hit her with an error for failing to  explicitly tell the customer that he \\*NEEDED\\* to enroll in autopay again  or else his pay plan would be changed. However overtly she may have implied it, QA insisted she must tell the customer that he needs to re-enroll \\*EXPLICITLY\\* because he cannot otherwise keep his pay plan. Granted, I've taken enough sup  calls to know that some customers are unfathomably dense and need to be told  how to manage their own accounts lest they hold you and the company accountable for every mistake they make, but the fact that this error came in  at the end of the month and absolutely \\*KILLED\\* her chances at a  promotion drove me over the edge. She wound up losing out to another  agent whose overall scorecard was lower, but who had a degree in  agriculture (I don't even know).  \n \n\nThe poor girl was utterly crestfallen, as she'd been dying to promote  off the phones since training due to a horrible anxiety issue that she, like many other agents, suffered from. I fought that error tooth and nail, but  management wouldn't reverse it. At that point, I couldn't tow the  company line anymore and I resigned about a month later. What compounded  my decision was the way my colleagues seemed to shrug it off, as if  having such a small part of an agent's scorecard dictate their  promotional potential was \"just part of the job\". I felt like an outsider amidst a lineup of apathetic company men.  \n \n\nWorse still, I really couldn't tell you how this job has developed my abilities. Yes, sups have a lot of responsibility to drive results, and so with some fancy wordplay you could make that look good on a resume, but the actual \\*skills\\* I used on the job are identical to the ones I went  into it with, and all I otherwise have to show for my time is work history and a title. I was lucky enough to be hired \\*AS\\* a supervisor, rather than  having to endure life as an agent, but if you have any compassion for  your own agents, I don't know how you can keep this job for long.\n\nI've decided that management, at least in the call center, is vastly overrated and have since found a job where I mostly do marketing work alone in a quiet office. Besides the autonomy and lack of big brother metrics, I'm grateful that I'm no longer in a position where I have to tell a poor girl that her career is being put on hold because of an overblown difference of opinion. I always felt like some kind of anti-hero at my call center, who tried to inspire people but also was tasked with routinely telling them why they need to get one of their metrics up (nevermind how much of a dice roll some of these metrics are). Now... I just feel like a normal dude again. My relationship with my work feels like my relationship with fiancee--it's natural and simple.\n\nTo each their own, but I feel that while call centers get more tolerable as you move up, I don't think they ever really get better.",

        "text": "I don’t know if this counts as r/pettyrevenge but this happened at a call center so I’m posting this here. I didn’t handle this call. I’m a supervisor and my agent did. Coming from a different country, this has always been a daily scenario and nobody really minds. Caller wants someone else stateside, okay. I’ll transfer you over to my supervisor. If you don’t want that either...Fine, I’ll transfer you to their department. What isn’t nice is when the caller starts being racist onset of the call. I mean, we all get it. English is our second language and we don’t have the same accent as most Americans have. That doesn’t mean you can be a piece of shit. Remember, you called because you needed help, not because you’re some kind of higher human being and just wanted to insult people. \nThis happened a month ago. Caller calls in asking for someone in the US, rep takes ownership and offers help but ‘hell nah, you live in a jungle who doesn’t even get paid 1% of what I do so fuck off’. Rep escalated the call to a supervisor but caller didn’t want that either and started being mean. Rep did transfer the call to me anyway because that’s a part of our policy. Started my opening spiel and caller thought I was from the US so okay. I didn’t need to correct her just to go through the same bullcrap again. Turned out she was just asking for credits. (I work for a telco company btw). Nope. You just insulted my rep who was very generous she gets called out for it almost every single month. Also, caller had a very very VERY bad credit and survived one full year without paying anything because her bill was always being removed by the retention department (which happened to be stateside) Caller got mad and asked me where I was located. We don’t lie to our customers so I had to admit I was the previous rep’s supervisor. She started being racist, saying she gets paid $40 an hour and she doesn’t want to do transactions with anyone who lives in a jungle and gets paid 50 cents a day. Caller went on saying we can only get out of poverty when we either marry Americans or scrub their toilets. Now that’s offensive as hell. Maybe I took it personally but my older friend used to be a nanny in a different country (not in the US though) and she was so nice but she was killed by the people she used to work for. All because she was from our country. I responded with ‘wow that’s a lot miss ******. I was just wondering why you haven’t paid your bills for 11 months with that rate’ At that point, I knew that was a mistreat but I didn’t care anymore. Caller got super mad and demanded a US rep but there was no way I would be transferring her over. I didn’t release the call. I wanted to upset her more. I, however, transferred her back to my rep who handled her earlier and she was already screaming when she was transferred back to me. Did the same thing for a couple of times until she demanded to cancel her account with us. She was always doing that when she couldn’t get what she wanted, and she would always be transferred to retention and they would always do their part to save her. NOPE. Not this time. I confirmed her request and this caller, who was a credit abuser, thought she would be transferred to retention, said yes. Okay. I cancelled the account and the call got disconnected. Bye Felicia. eoc. \n\nLPT: be nice when you’re calling customer service. We tend to give what our customers want if they’re not racist and mean. ",

        "text": "Going through and posting a few gems from my years in call centers, and figured this one counts as one of the best. My last one is [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/8vce44/what_a_beautiful_beginning/)\n\n\nI'm still working in Delivery and Install for the Beers-soundalike at this point, and one lady called in super upset that the installer wouldn't come back out to finish the install of her TV. \n\nNow, TVs are super simple if they don't have a wallmount included. Put TV in place, hook up to 1 or 2 devices like a DVD player or cable box, check if it works, *leave*. I'm curious why an installer wouldn't *finish* an install, since its easy money as far as installs go. \n\n**Me:** Opening spiel\n\n**Cust**: You need to call your installer and tell him to get his ass back out here! They keep telling me they won't come back and finish hooking my TV up!\n\n**Me:** (Internally groaning) I'm sorry Ma'am, let me check your account and see what's going on...\n\n*(Queue verification and such)*\n\n**Me:** Okay, so there's a note that says they won't come back... Did the installer say why he wouldn't come back?\n\n**Cust:** No, he just stopped in the middle of it and said he wasn't coming back, and that bitch at the office says I need to clean my house!\n\nIt was here I got curious. See, we allowed our installers, since they were all contractors, to opt out of a job if the customer's premises were in some way hazardous, or if the customer got hostile. Bug infestations, mold, crazy shotgun-wielding old men, you get the idea. So for this lady to be confused as to why she needed to clean, I was.. curious. I mean, what could be bad enough that an installer won't come back, but not noticeable enough for someone to even know something is wrong?\n\nSo I put the customer on hold and call the installer's office.\n\n**InOf:** Installer Office, this is Patty. \n\n**Me:** Hey Patty! I'm talking to a customer on my other line, and she says we won't go back out to finish an install on-\n\n**InOf:** Oh, is that -customer name-?\n\n**Me:** Uh, yes. I just wanted to see why we wouldn't go out, and if you'd consider releasing the job so we might be able to schedule somebody else.\n\n**InOf:** Well, good luck. We'll release it, but you should talk to Joe first, he was the installer on that one. Here he is.\n\n**Me:** *(Thinking this must be bad)* Hey Joe! Can you tell me about -customer name-?\n\n**Joe:** Yeah. Her house is filled with Cat Shit.\n\n**Me:**...\n\n**Joe:**...\n\n**Me:** Uh, excuse me?\n\n**Joe:** Cat shit. Like, the lady has about ten cats, and no litter box, so they shit everywhere. It's on the couches, the tables, the floor, counters, *everywhere*. (At this point, he sounds like a Vietnam vet, and he's back in the jungle) I was willing to do it at first, just drop in the TV and plug it in, screw in the cable from the cable box, right? Well, I have to wipe off some baxter-turds from the entertainment center, and then when I reach back to plug it in, my hand sinks into a fat pile of Cat Shit, and I lose it. She has shit all over the *power strip*. That is *dangerous*. I washed my hand off in the sink, purel'd the hell out of it, and told her we needed a receipt from a cleaning service before we'd come back.\n\n**Me:**... Well, I'd like you to know that we will back you 100%, and I'll let the customer know she has a week to get a receipt, and if she doesn't contact you, or you don't hear from us, go ahead and cancel the ticket with a code for them canceling on you, so that you get paid for it.\n\nNow, I get to explain all of this to the customer. *Joy*. \n\n**Me:** Hello Ma'am? Thank you for holding-\n\n**Cust:** When are they coming back?\n\n**Me:** Well, after speaking with the installer, we agree that you will need to provide a receipt from a cleaning company before we'll send someone back out. \n\n**Cust:** What do you mean?! If they won't do it, then just send somebody else!\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, I'm sorry, but the installer has reported that your home isn't safe, and we will not be sending someone else out until the house is cleaned. \n\n**Cust:** Excuse me?! What do you mean, cleaned?! It's not even dirty in here! What did they say?!\n\n**Me:** (Boggled by this lady's insistence that her house is clean) Ma'am, the installer reported that your house has numerous cat droppings out in the open, and that when he was installing teh TV he had to clean some of it off the entertainment center, and even put his hand in some when he was plugging it in on your power strip. \n\n**Cust:** Oh, come on, it's just a little cat shit! \n\nI fought with her for another ten minutes before having to explain it to a supervisor, who then backed me up and said she could email him a copy of the receipt in the next week and we would send an installer back out. \n\nTL;DR: Lady's house is covered in cat shit. Installer refuses to go back. We back him on it. \n\n",

        "text": "So, I've posted once or twice on here, but I've worked in callcenters for about 6-7 years at this point, and I always love the shared misery I can find on this page. To know that so many of us go through the exact same shit lets me get through my day sometimes.\n\nThis story is from the beginning of my career in call centers. I started working for a large company who had been big in the business of hardware equipment and large appliances, and I worked in the department that handled their Delivery and Installation customer service. You all know them, and their name rhymes with what most of my colleagues went home and drank after a long day working there. Beers!\n\nThis was a call I received while I was in training, and I like to think it prepared me for the years of neglect and abuse I've suffered in frontline customer service, as I could always point to it and say \"That was worse\".\n\n&gt; Me(M): Me, a freshly trained Delivery and Installation agent.\n\n&gt; IC: An Irate Customer\n\nM: Thank you for calling **Company** Delivery and Installation, how can I help you today?\n\nIC: Your delivery guys gave me a lawn mower that won't turn on, and you need to replace it!\n\nNow, at the time I was told we check everything before we leave, and make sure things work first, but I found out later that this was very much a 'Perfect World' scenario. \n\nM: Well, [sappy apology], but I'd be happy to help you get one reordered. \n\nIC: Just tell them to come back and take it away. I can't move it.\n\nM: Well, I see the delivery team is already a couple stops away, so they won't be able to come pick it up today, but I can have them pick it up when they deliver the new one.\n\nIC: It's in the middle of the driveway! I can't move it! It won't turn on, and if it doesn't turn on, it won't move!\n\nAt this point, I know almost nothing about riding lawn mowers, other than you ride them, and they cut grass, so I go along with the customer since he seems to know more about them. (Silly me)\n\nM:Well, if you can push it off the driveway, we can still pick it up. \n\nIC: I can't! I had back surgery! I can't just push it!\n\nAt this point, we go bck and forth, with him getting angrier and angrier, but I get him calmed down, and get to scheduling the replacement. The next available delivery, you ask? Oh, my friend, that is the problem. \n\nThat mower isn't in stock, so we have to order one. Next time we have one? Next week. \n\nJoy.\n\nM: So, we can go out next Thursday...\n\nIC:[Incoherent yelling]\n\nM: I'm sorry, sir, could you repeat that?\n\nIC: I *said*, you can just come pick it up, and I'm going to leave it by the curb! If it get's stolen, that's your problem!\n\nAt this point, I check with my floor support, and he says that the delivery guys may not be the best at checking if stuff works, but they don't get paid for a stop unless they have a signature from the customer. I confirmed earlier in the call that the customer did sign for it, so I let him know that since he signed for it, if it were stolen in the next week, we wouldn't be able to replace it, since we have to take back the non-working one. \n\nNeedless to say, that call lasted another 20 minutes with him bitching up a storm. \n\nTL;DR: Guy gets upset at a non-working mower, then even more upset when we won't replace it. Good introduction into Call Centers.\n",

        "text": "Hi! First time posting! I work for call centers for a while but this particular story happened somewhere around 2010 when I worked for big mobile operator. \n\nOne day lady calls and claims that she just got her phone bill for last month and it has to be some mistake because it is stupidly high. She is laughing and apparently thinking it is indeed some mistake. OK, let's check. She had two numbers on her account and for one of them, she got her usual 69 zł (this was in Poland, 69 zł is roughly 17$). Her second number though... over 12000 zł billed. \n\nNow, it was fairly standard back then. It was the rise of smartphones era, mobile plans were not designed with internet in mind, so usually with typical plans you got like 100 MB of data and after exceeding it, it was ludicrously expensive. Every customer was warned to buy some additional data packs or to turn off internet access to avoid it. In case of complain, company policy was to cancel such billings under the term that customer agrees to enable some additional data plan.\n\nSo fair and simple, her second number connected with internet a lot. I told her that and asked her to fill a complaint and that probably it would be OK. if only... She got upset and told me that it is impossible that her second number connected with internet, that number is used by her son and HE KNOWS not to connect to internet. She insisted that it's billing error on our part, and force me to make a case to our tech support. Uhhh... OK, I do it and promise to call back to her when I get response.\n\nFew hour later I get details from our tech department, all of IP addressees she connected to with detailed info about time and data sent in each session. I call back to her, tell her that we checked and our info is correct. She start to scream and me and I clearly hear her son behind her shouting that we are bunch of thieves and he did not access internet. She claims that IP addresses are \"just a number\" and she wants to know names of the web pages. This isn't really our standard service but situation is unusual so OK, I pass this again to our techs.\n\nNext day I clock in and get few emails that this client called 7 times already and demanded to speak with me about \"billing fraud\". I also get report from tech department with list of sites corresponding with IP addressees. I look at it and... it's magnificent. Almost 100% of list are things like: gay-paradise.com, bigblackgays.com, manlylove, gay dating sites, gay porn etc. all of it. \n\nI call her, she instantly starts to scream and swear at me, her son from the background yells and swears even louder. I try few times to just tell her that billing is right but she demands the names of the sites and claims that I don't have it because it's all fake. So after taking deep breath I slowly start to read the sites along with dates and amount of data transfer and they are still yelling. After two sites I notice that son suddenly gets quieter and stops talking, she does the same after one or two more. It's just complete silence and I'm reading whole list containing of like 100 entries. i finish and tell her that none of this really matters, she can still file a complain and it will be cancelled but there is dead silence on the other side. Finally I hear quiet \"goodbye\" and she hangs up. \n\nI looked up her billings few weeks later and she filed a complain but it was in \"I'm terribly sorry, I have no clue that my son was doing that\" vibe. What I'm most astounded is what was her son thinking, he had to know that we are able to identify all of it, so maybe he should calm her down instead of putting more oil to her fire.",

        "text": "Oh hey my last post was pretty well received! Thanks guys. Now I'll tell the story of one of the most painful calls I've ever gotten, from a client who was not exactly rude persay but just didn't believe me when I told him I couldn't do what he wanted.\n\nNow I work in credit card activations, and here's a dirty secret about my department: other than activate cards, we can't do shit. I'd actually say my main duty is selling the credit card insurance that I offer eligible client's but when it comes to customer service matters I'm pretty limited so when client's ask me questions I usually end up transferring them. Not sure if every bank works this way but they one I work for does.\n\nSo the client calls in and right away I can tell there's a major language barrier. Good news is that that means I don't have to sell to him (company policy), bad news is everything else that comes with working with a language barrier.\n\nMe: Hi this is (my name) and I'll be assisting you today. Can you give me your credit card number please?\n\nClient: Ok. Here's card number (he starts dialing the card number into his phone)\n\nMe: No sir I need you to say your card number aloud please.\n\nClient: Here's card number (continues dialing)\n\nMe: No sir speak it into the phone.\n\nClient: I'm giving you card number (continues dialing)\n\nMe: No sir with your voice give me the card number.\n\nClient: Oh voice ok. (Client finally starts reading out his card number. I'm not sure if he has a speach impediment or if this is just how he thinks numbers are pronounced but every time he got to a one he said it in a odd way, instead of just saying one he'd say w-w-w-w-w-one. He did not have this issue with other words. Naturally his card number had a bunch of one's in it so getting his number out of him took forever.)\n\nWe got through the security questions pretty well all things considered, I had to speak slowly and occasionally rephrase the questions when he didn't understand me, but we got through them. I told him his card is activated and was about to send him on his way when he stopped me.\n\nClient: Wait I have question.\n\nI start groaning internally here. Remember that I can't do customer service stuff, I can answer simple questions but I don't have full access to the client's account information or the ability to change anything. I give him the go ahead to ask his question and just hope it's something simple.\n\nClient: what is the card limit?\n\nMe: (that's a question I can't answer so I read him the scripted response) I'm sorry sir but I have limited access to your information so would you like me to transfer you to my colleagues at customer service?\n\nClient: No just tell me card limit.\n\nMe: I can't tell you your card limit because I don't have access to that information. If you'd like I can transfer you to a customer service representative who can help you.\n\nClient: why can't you just answer question?\n\nMe: I don't have the answer to your question.\n\nClient: Then say that not the other thing. Why didn't you just tell me you don't have card limit?\n\nMe: (I'm just trying really hard to get rid of him set this point) I'm sorry for that sir, customer service can help you Would you like me to transfer you?\n\nClient: ok transfer me but first I have another question...\n\nIt went on and on like that at least ten times. This guy had a bunch of questions and requests to change something about his account, none of which I answer or do for him. He just keep kept on asking questions never once taking the hint that I wasn't there right person to ask. Eventually he ran out of questions and I finally got to transfer him to customer service. Now calls like this where they only thing I've actually done for the client is activate their card usually take about 2-3 minutes, this call took 25 minutes because A: I had to work around a language barrier and B: he just would not stop asking questions. Even remembering this experience makes me scream internally.",

We also have three people that work on insurance verification (making sure a patients insurance is active, they are assigned to us as their primary, and up-to-date on their payments to insurance. {the insurance won't over the office visits if they are in what they call a \"grace period\" due to non payment}).\n\nSo over the last three weeks we've had this INSANE lady calling and harassing us. I talked to her twice, and three others talked to her at least once each.  She always has her insurance on the line I guess as a witness? And mentions every time she calls that she's suing them already for various reasons. She tends to ramble on tangents about all the things that have supposedly happened to her at various doctors offices and hardly lets you speak before she finally gets to her point. \n\nOne coworker had set her up with a new patient appointment, but her insurance wouldn't change to us as her primary until next month. The patient called again at least once more about moving up her appointment only to be told we aren't set as her primary yet.\n\nShe tried to escalate it with them, but it came back denied \"Due to contract\" from us. This was the second call I received from her with her insurance questioning what this means. I called over to the verification manager to find out. \"It means she's seen another primary care provider this month already and since INSURANCE COMPANY is  capitated, that means we won't get paid if we see her this month. INSURANCE COMPANY know that, I don't know why they're throwing us under the bus for this, but I will explain it to them.\" I warned her of the patient's issues and wished her luck.\n\nI get a call back from our verification manager and she's laughing. \"You weren't kidding about her! oh boy. SO I just wanted to update you. She's a DSI. Do you know what that is?\"\n\nI replied, \"No idea.\"\n\nShe stated, \"It's a drug-seeking individual. I looked it up and she's been to 6 different doctors since January trying to get pain medications and was even rejected from a pain management facility. I spoke with PRACTICE MANAGER about not having her be our patient. We don't want this kind of person.\"\n\nOur immediate manager in the call center knew of the situations and told us she won't be becoming our patient the next day.\n\nShe called in a couple days after that, yelled at one of the new kids, and was told officially she won't be our patient. She called in once more and spoke with one of our veterans threatening, \"I will just come in anyways to that appointment!\" Which had already been cancelled. And apparently she threatened to sue us too.\n\nNow that was last week. Yesterday (Friday), apparently her insurance called, spoke with my coworker that handles administrative calls, and the patient has filed an official complaint with them about us full of lies. They faxed over a copy of her list of complaints.\n\nIn them she complains about various things, one being that every time she calls there is a 30+ minute wait. Well, with our new phone system we got a few months ago, it tracks her phone number and it sees when she called, how long she waited in queue, which people she spoke with, and when she gets transferred. Longest wait time in queue for her? 11 minutes 29 seconds. So every other call she made she waited less than that. My manager screen shot her call history with wait times and sent that to PRACTICE MANAGER to give to INSURANCE COMPANY.\n\nThe hilarious complaint was she named me and the coworker that handles administrative calls by name as \"managers\" who YELLED at her and personally denied her being a patient. I joked with my manager, \"SO now that we're promoted, does that mean we get raises?\". LOL.  Our calls and INSURANCE COMPANY's calls are recorded so obviously we're covered with proof we didn't yell.\n\nINSURANCE COMPANY wants us to send our side of the story, so PRACTICE MANAGER is compiling everything to send.\n\nSorry that got long!\n\nTL'DR, Drug-seeking patient harasses our staff and gets herself banned before ever having her first appointment with us. Lies to her insurance about us, but we have proof of her lies.",

        "text": "I am a very calm person, and I rarely get angry. Irritated, sure, but not angry. My colleagues have noticed this, and it's a bit of an inside joke (since my two closest colleagues are very energetic, and one is prone to anger. We make a nice team).\n\nEvery single day this week has felt like a week on its own. It's been tough, and at two times one of these colleagues have turned to me after a call and looked at me with a look that said that she has never seen that side of me before.\n\nI do CS for a specific medical device, which has two components: the sensor and the scanner. You put the sensor on the body, and then use the scanner to get data from it. The sensor needs to be changed every now and then, unless it falls off or breaks, in which case  we replace it.\n\nThe first call was from a new user (hereafter known as NU) of the device, and he called in wanting the scanner replaced.\n\nMe: Opening Spiel\n\nNU: Hello, my name is New User. This scanner I got three months ago is broken. It doesn't show the right values.\n\nMe: \\[probes a little more about the problem, and it turns out to be a classic fault of the sensor. There is no doubt about this\\]\n\nMe: Actually, the problem seems to be with the sensor, which I'll happily repla-\n\nNU: No, it's the scanner. The hospital lent me a new one, and now it works. I need to have it replaced so I can give back the other one to the hospital.\n\nMe: I can't do that. If you got a new scanner, you are also using a new sensor, since one sensor cannot be used with two scanners. Did you get a new sensor that you are using with the borrowed scanner?\n\nNU: Yes, that is correct.\n\nMe: Exactly, and now it's working because you are using a sensor that's not defect.\n\nNU: Are you not listening to me? What do you even know about this? Are you stupid? I'm telling you, the scanner broken and I need a new one.\n\nThis went on for 15 minutes, and I think at some point he even realized he was wrong, but was too proud to admit it. I never shouted, but I did firmly state several times that I will not replace his scanner. Eventually he hung up on me. The thing is that 5 minutes later he called back (and yours truly got the call, of course) and claimed some other fault, and by company policy I have to replace it, even though I know he is lying. I bet he feels like he \"won\". Good look, New User, because that defect is fairly common, and you will most likely have to replace your scanner a few times a year.\n\nThe other call was far too messy for me to get into all the details. Let's just say that there are few problems with some of the staff at my place\\*, and this customer had been on of their victims. No one told him that his order for new sensors didn't go through, since his county has new routines and he needs to call another number to place the order. I was working the late shift, and my colleague had just sent him an email with this info just before quitting this Friday afternoon. So who got the call when the customer called in furious? Me.\n\nNow, I got where he was coming from. He had gotten treaten badly, but he yelled at me and insisted that I make An Exception and fix his order so that he will get it before he goes on vacation. I can't. I literally can't do anything, and I had to fight to get him to understand this. Eventually he calmed down, we talked about the whole thing. I apologized for the situation my colleagues had put him in (which was really shitty), and he apologized for being rude and angry with me. We ended the call at a very friendly place. Though in the beginning there was this gem to be found. C=Customer.\n\nMe: Opening spiel\n\nC: \\[angry incoherent yelling\\]\n\nC: You can see it all there in your system by my number. Just search my number and you will see what I'm talking about.\n\nMe: Well, yes, normally I could, but you are calling from a hidden number. Could I have your phone number please?\n\nC: \\[silence\\]\n\nMe: C, I cannot see your HIDDEN NUMBER, would you like to give it to me please?\n\nStill, since he turned out to be a stressed person put in a bad place, and apologized for his behavior, I will remember the call fondly.\n\n\\*Don't tell me to go to management or the company with this. We have, and we are the ones who got warnings for \"negativity\". There will be a story about this whole affair after I leave that place in August.",

I’ve worked in complaints review before and our specialist help team, and I’m on manager track so it’s not a new thing for me. \n\nSaw a manager was swamped one day this week, and I asked if they needed help. They say sure, can you pick this escalation up and contact them for me? Sure, no probs dude. Anything to avoid taking calls, amirite y’all? \n\nWell, I should’ve kept my fucking trap shut. The case was an absolute fucking shit show of a stinker and was not going to be easy. In fact, when I called and introduced myself, the lady was fucking RAGING because of another handler change. \n\nAnyway, this poor love had issues spanning months and multiple male managers had taken a stab at it. It’s summer, holidays and staff changes happen so it’s unavoidable. \n\nI spent a good hour on the phone with this lady ironing everything out and getting it sorted. I offered to pass it back to the originating manager to follow up but she says, “Alyss, I’d prefer if you did it because I’ve got more done in 45 minutes with you than I have in the entirety of the time this has been ongoing.” \n\nSweet, that’s another tick in my box for future promotion. I know my manager will be going on maternity leave at some point in the next 6 months and is gonna take the full year (although nobody else knows except for her manager and another close colleague) so I’m gunning for that bad boy. \n\nI calls this lady back today to discuss money. They take a more expensive, higher tier product and accepts my low ball comp figure to boot - although it was still high considering the depth and length of the issue. Bish bash bosh, job done. \n\nTowards the end of the call, I give my usual “Is there absolutely anything else I can help you with in the meantime?” \n\nThe lady says no and I’m thinking ✅✅✅💷💷💷 MIC DROP byeeee and the dreaded word comes. \n\nBut. \n\nI’m now thinking, “oh fucking hell, here we go.” \n\nLady says, “Since we last spoke, I’ve spoken with my coworkers. They know the whole sorry saga, but I had to tell them about you and now we’ve got a running joke in the office. Would you like to hear it?” \n\nSure, why not, it’s better than another problem! \n\n“It’s taken x amount of male managers x amount of time to do barely anything - and as soon as I get a female manager, it’s sorted in 45 minutes!

You can imagine that plenty of people get pissed off at me for daring to try to sell them something, but amazingly this bitch actually got pissy at me before I even said a word about the insurance plan. Transcript as I remember it as follows:\n\nMe: Hi this is (my name) speaking and I'll assist you today! To ensure the privacy of your information I'll need to ask you some questions to ensure I'm speaking with the correct card holder. Can I get your credit card number please?\n\nClient: I just punched it into the phone.\n\nMe: that's just too send you to the correct department, that doesn't come through to me. I'm going to need you to read it aloud please.\n\nClient proceeds to read out her card number like she's trying to give Speedy Gonzales a run for his money. Naturally I can't punch it in that fast and miss a bunch of numbers, forcing me to ask again. Client's tone is getting annoyed and I thank my lucky stars she can't see me or my fist clenching might have gotten me in trouble.\n\nMe, after finally managing to piece her card number together no thanks to her: can I get your name as it appears on the card?\n\nClient: it's (name)\n\nMe: Thanks (first name)\n\nClient (cutting me off) Excuse me, it's Miss (last name). You don't seriously call everyone by their first name do you?\n\nMe: umm, yeah usually. People don't generally have a problem with it.\n\nClient: well you should stop. I don't know you and you don't know me, it's so rude call me (first name)\n\nClient then spends a solid minute lecturing me about how rude I am for daring to call her by her own damn name. I'd rewrite the whole thing about honestly it kinda went in one ear and out the other. I was just waiting for her to finish so I could get off the damn phone already. Anyway she finally gets off her high horse long enough to answer the other security questions and the moment the truth arrives: whether or not I have to do a product pitch to this bitch.

Unfortunately she was eligible, so I resigned myself to my fate wondering how this lady was going to lose her shit next.\n\nMe: Thank you for activating your credit card, I'd like to let you know about (name of insurance plan)\n\nClient: (cutting me off again) No thank you (hangs up)\n\nI was stunned. On one hand, don't have to suffer through her bullshit anymore, yay! On the other hand, this hypocritical bitch, who lectured *me* about being rude, literally hung up on me mid sentence. I was so disgruntled by this whole damn call that I \"accidently\" hit the cancel button instead of activating her card. Oh well, she's just going to have find out the hard way.",

        "text": "Okay so I'm not sure if this belongs here or in /r/CallCentres because it's not a transcription, I'm kinda venting, but this is essentially a retelling of a call I just took. So. If I should move it, say the word.\n\nBackground: With my company, not everyone can do cancellations. We have a team of phone agents who are allowed to do it, and we're not any higher than the other agents, we just had training they didn't. So when cancellation requests come up, we pretend to be managers and handle the cancellation. However, we have no way of transferring calls, just the \"ticket\". So if someone gets a call who can't do a cancellation, they have to find a cancellation agent who's available, who then leaves their desk and takes the call at the first agent's desk. \n\nSince we don't want non-cancellation agents doing the actual cancellations, I essentially go through the script, and then the other agent \"assigns\" me the member's ticket. This just means it has my name on it and it shows up as an alert on my computer, then I go back to my desk and make all the necessary changes, type my notes, and submit them. \n\nThis one member called who was already mad about stuff that, to her credit, was reasonable shit to be mad about. Then she said she was gonna wait on the line for the cancellation confirmation email, but I explained to her that I actually couldn't send it until after the call ended. At this point, she blew up, yelling at me that she was a computer programmer and that her phone number has nothing to do with \"the system\" (she said that sarcastically) and told me that I was just trying to get her off the phone, that she was going to write bad reviews about us, blah blah blah. And she had been cutting me off through the whole call already, so I kinda lost my cool too.\n\nI cut her off, which we're not supposed to do, since our members are mostly just old people who have a certain idea of what respect should be, and told her, \"\\[Customer Name\\], you can write whatever kind of reviews you want, you're absolutely free to do that if that's what makes your experience with us worth your time. I majored in computer science too, so we both know every program is going to be different and some are just more convoluted than others. I've done all I can for you today. I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but your account has been cancelled per your request and you will no longer be receiving any products from us as requested. I can 100&amp;#37; guarantee that you will receive a cancellation confirmation email in the next few minutes, but you're going to have to wait until the call has ended because my system will not permit me to do a whole lot while the call is still going. Have a wonderful day.\" And then I hung up before anything else, which is also something we're not supposed to do (unless it's *really* out of hand). \n\nWriting it out, it doesn't really sound that bad, but holy *shit,* being on the phone with her was the WORST. I'm an angry-crier too so even though I was pissed off I just looked like an embarrassing crybaby at the other agent's desk after finishing the call. \n\nYeah, you were a progammer, huh Debra? You know every computer system in the world Kathy? That's great, why don't YOU clock in and do my job for me, Helen! Since you apparently know so damn much.",

        "text": "This comes a special thing that my CC had, supervisors where the ones one the floor, supervising, had teams in charge of them, took escalated calls, were supposed to know the policies and procedures perfectly, you know the deal. And managers, they took care of internal processes, rarely ever had any training on the account policies and some hadn’t “touched a phone” in a decade or more.\n\n\nThis lead to one special thing, when a caller asked for a manager, by policy, we were not allowed to just transfer it to a sup because the person expected a manager and were required to tell them that managers did not take calls, which combined with the fact that we could never offer passing the call to a supervisor, whichled to fun times.\n\nThis happened on my early days before I knew better:\n\n*a lot that I don’t remember happens in the call which leads to this (I’ll use C as caller)*\n\n- C: I need to speak to a manager\n- me: I’m sorry ma’am, but I’m unable to transfer you to a manager\n- c: why’s that?\n- me: ummmm managers don’t calls \n- c: then what the hell do they do?\n- me: (panicking by now and can be heard in my voice) they manage internal processes, but do not take calls\n- c: (cutting me off) I don’t care get me a manager or someone above you \n\nNow, saying higher ups or someone above was the same as asking for a sup so I gladly transferred her...\n\nA while after, this policy was changed and you could offer a sup instead, it’s wasn’t fun but it was better than falling into loops for not having managers that took calls.

        "text": "Hey there! Usually I like reading stories but nothing really gets to me enough to post my own. Until recently.\n\n\n**Story 1:** \n\nI get a manager call (escalated from supervisors, meaning I'm the third person they're speaking to). A woman we'll call Alex is past due but trying to get to her core issue is like pulling teeth. I even mention her account is past due and ask if she wants an arrangement. Alex says no, she wants to file a complaint. Sure, no problem. Usually. She starts asking questions like previous employees personal information, internal processes, and I advise her I can't give her internal information. THEN she says \"well I'm a freelance reporter and I'm going to write an exposé on your company!\"\n\nWell then. I'm almost positive there's a process for this. I put her on hold and tell her I'm connecting her to the right person for her issue. After a bit if digging, I find an official media contact. The thing about these contacts is they have zero access to customer accounts and also are not able to enter complaints. Due to them being very white collar busy people, the default media number goes straight to voicemail. Checked on the account later on, it was disconnected for non-payment and she hasn't called back.\n\n\n\n**Story 2:**\n\nThis is the tale of a woman we'll just call Clueless because let's be real. I take this as a Supervisor call, meaning I'm the second person she is speaking to.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling my company, I am kd a manager with financial services. How can I help you?\n\nClueless: My account is past due but I MADE a payment and YOU guys lost it.\n\nMe: sure. I can fill out a payment investigation and get you back up and running with no additional payment no problem. I just need the exact amount, the day it cleared your bank, and the card number you used...\n\nClueless: I have a CONFIRMATION number.\n\nMe: good, I can add that to the notes of the investigation but I still need your card num--\n\nClueless: NO. NOOOO I KNOW HOW YOU PEOPLE WORK I AM NOT GIVING YOU INFORMATION TO TAKE MORE MONEY FROM ME\n\nMe: I understand, this is not a payment it's for--\n\nClueless: I KNOW THIS CALL IS RECORDED I DO NOT! AUTHORIZE A PAYMENT. I AM NOT! PAYING! DO NOT! TAKE MONEY FROM THIS CARD.\n\nMe: right, this is only for investiga--\n\nClueless: DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ARE YOU LISTENING AM I CLEAR!\n\ngirl, you just pushed my bitch button.\n\nMe, holding the mic close to my mouth because maybe she can't hear me: This is NOOOT for a payment. We are NOOOOT debiting your account today NOOOO payment is being made. When you're ready, go ahead and start with the card number.\n\nClueless: I'm starting with the CONFIRMATION number. 123, 456, 7890.\n\nMe: This doesn't look like ours. Our confirmation numbers are usually 5 or 6 characters.\n\nClueless: IT IS YOURS HERE I'LL READ THE TEXT MESSAGE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PAYMENT OF 133.62 TODAY FOR MORE HELP VISIT (cable company website)\n\nMe: audible deep breath because idgaf any more.\n\nMe: Mrs. Clueless, we are cell phone company not cable company.\n\nClueless: NO YOU'RE NOT I CALLED CABLE COMPANY!\n\nMe: I'm sorry if our automated system, and the agent, and myself were unclear this is cell phone company.\n\nClueless: MY CABLE COMPANY BILL IS PAST DUE!\n\nMe: okay. Your cell phone bill is also past due. Do you want to pay the amount of 145.89 to reconnect?\n\nClueless: finally hangs up.\n\n\n\n\n\nI need a vacation.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, this one is a lot shorter, and from my first few months of being a CSR, still very green.\n\nAnother day of the monotonous when this call came in.\n\nHas anyone ever had to work through an interpreter? It's not that fun. You have to remember to say \"Go ahead\" whenever you are done, and when you forget the interpreter often gets annoyed.\n\nAnyway, this happened at the same call center as my last post.\n\nWS = woman's son\n\nW = woman\n\n\\&gt; Me: Thank you for calling \\[company\\] my name is cappy6124. May I have your first and last name please?\n\nWS gives me his name and says that he want's to talk about his bill.\n\n\\&gt; Me: Sorry WS but I see that you aren't authorized on the account is there any way that I can speak with the account holder?\n\n\\&gt; WS: Well, she doesn't speak English very well, she speaks Polish, can you get an interpreter?\n\n\\&gt; Me: Sure thing!\n\nI was very excited to do this as it was my first time using an interpreter, I thought it would be kind of fun. It was at first, until I found out why WS called in.\n\nThe woman had received a bill for just over $2000. The woman's son had bought a new phone and given his old phone to his sister. Being the first phone that the sister had with the \"app store\" (I use this term loosely as the phone was an LG Dare, remember Tony Stark's phone from the first  Iron Man?) she had ran up quite a bill with app/ring tone purchases and guess what, everything she downloaded accrued data charges as $1.99/MB. Here's the problem,  WS was not authorized on the account, so how did this phone get activated? There are a few ways.\n\n1. If you know the account password you could do it by dialing a number on the phone.\n2. You take it in to a store and they don't bother to verify the account, and don't bother to offer any blocks (stores are the worst and often mess up accounts worse than customers can).\n\nI believe this issue was caused by the second, but having very few remarks on the account from when the phone was activated, there was no way to know who activated it. So, trying to help her out, I went through the standard negotiations that we were trained to do, when the customer finally said the following, yelling out of frustration, rightfully so, with the interpreter also yelling the translation (this had been going on for about 10 minutes).\n\n\\&gt; W: Why are you doing this to me? My son already went through all of this and they said they were going to fix it! Why are you telling me that you can't do anything now?!\n\n\\&gt; Me: Wait? What? Somebody already promised you the full amount?\n\nI started looking through the account notes again, there it was! Another CSR had promised the customer 100&amp;#37; refund because W had agreed to block data and the app store, but, their supervisor declined the credit stating that it was out of policy. They then proceeded to call the customer and leave a voicemail saying that they could only credit 25 or 50&amp;#37; (I can't remember which). Doing that is a big problem,  as we had already offered the full credit.\n\nI should note, that the supervisor was correct that the credit was outside of policy. Because this is technically a case of fraud (in the eyes of \\[company\\]), and would have to go through the legal group, and charges filed. Which, of course she wouldn't want to do, her son didn't know any better.\n\nI spoke to a supervisor, and they said the same thing and agreed to process the credit, which was even better for me as I was scored on how much I credited accounts, and this would have really hurt my stats for the month.\n\nW was so happy, she was crying. I was able to follow  up on this account, because I had to set up a case for my supervisor. She credited the account, and all was well!",

And then...\n\n&gt;**CC:** \\[distant from the phone, likely speaking to his wife\\] \"Honey, they can't find your mom's account, this is getting even weirder.\" \\[comes back to the phone\\] \"Yeah we've been tryna cancel since her mom had surgery but haven't had any luck.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** \"I see, I'm sorry that this hasn't been taken care of. Once we get the account up we can arrange for a refund of the last order. Did I hear you say that this account is for someone else?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** \"Yes, her mother.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me:** \\[eyes rolling into the next dimension\\] \"And what is *her* name?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** \"Firstname Lastname.\"\n\nMAGICALLY, the account comes up.

        "text": "Oh wow! The annoyance of this call permeated through my whole day like food poisoning. I will be me and Confusing Man will be CM.\n\nMe: - Usual Greeting - \n\nCM: Yes my bill is only £80 - it’s usually £1000?\n\nMe: This is due to a customer meter reading we received from you. We had been over billing you for some time as you had never sent in a meter reading.\n\nCM: My shop uses ovens, lights, freezers... this isn’t right. \n\nMe: It is right. If you’re not happy with this you could send in another reading just to check this is correct? \n\nCM:  that’s not the point - Your system is wrong. How does your system work out estimated readings?\n\nMe: off of customer meter readings and other factors.\n\nCM: I. Need. You. To. Explain. This. To. Me. Clearly. \n\nMe: *internally screaming* I just have sir. It’s based on previous readings for agents and customers. I can’t be more specific about exactly how it calculates your estimated reads as it’s a very complex system - However, i could investigate your account this afternoon and call you back in a hour or so?\n\nCM: You shouldn’t need to. All I want is a clear explanation as to how you’ve worked out this bill and why it’s £80!\n\nMe: As I said, your bill is accurate. Your bills moving forward will be a lot lower and you may get some credit on your account next week. \n\nCM: Can you promise my bills will stay this low now?\n\nMe: *more internally screaming* I can be fairly certain, but I can’t be 100% sure. \n\nCM: No I need you to be sure. I want certainty. \n\nMe: I am sorry sir I can’t give you that. I can be fairly certain but that’s all. Your consumption could change and invoices could increase or decrease. \n\nCM: So what can you do to correct me account - I still think it’s wrong.\n\nMe: Send in a meter reading to email address xxx sir. That will help. \n\nCM: *He takes a deep sigh* Fine I will send one in.\n\nHoly cow. This call repeated itself for at least half an hour. I’m not sure how I survived. \n\n",

Background: I’d been dealing with her escalations and employee support all day, as well as doing some coaching and recognition, between taking calls and working on data mining for a project I’m working on in house. Needless to say, I rarely approach unless it’s a technical issue, an escalation of my own, or something REALLY important. \n\n\n\n\nMe: Hi manager, sorry to interrupt. \n\nManager: Princess, I’m in the middle of a coaching session right now. Can you come back later? \n\nMe: I would...but there’s a fire outside the building by the electrical cabinet and the police are here. \n\nManager: ...let me get my coat. ",

This is definitely someone who’s not paid their bill on time and had services cut off.)\n\nMe: I’m really sorry to hear that your services aren’t working at the moment. If I could take some information, I’d be happy to look into this for you. Can I please take your full name and address please?\n\nIW: My name is Mrs Moron and my address is 123 Dumbfuck Avenue, AB12 3CD.\n\nMe: Okay, thank you very much. \n\nIW: We paid our bill today, it should be working already! This is ridiculous! \n\nMe: Ah. I understand you’re calling in regards to a reconnection of services after the payment of an overdue bill, is that correct? \n\nIW: You know I am! You can see it all on your screen!!\n\n(...give me strength. And also tequila.) \n\nMe: Mrs Moron, I regret to inform you that under the recent GDPR that came into effect on xyz, I can only discuss this matter with the account holder as I would need to discuss sensitive information in regards to billing. You are not authorised to deal on the account holders behalf. \n\n(GDPR is causing me to lose hair. Just designate your authorised parties before you have them call, for fucks sake!) \n\nIW: Well, MY HUSBAND has had to go to work! I have children! \n\nMe: Whilst I understand this is frustrating, Mrs Moron-\n\nIW: NO YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND, YOU DON’T HAVE CHILDREN. \n\n(You’re lucky this is my job lady. I could have fifty kids or be infertile for all you know.) \n\nIW: THEY HAVE HOMEWORK. THEY ARE BACK AT SCHOOL TOMORROW AND THEY HAVEN’T DONE THEIR HOMEWORK AGAIN AND IT’LL BE ALL YOUR FAULT. I WILL TAKE YOUR COMPANY TO COURT. \n\nMe: I cannot discuss this matter with you as you are not the account holder. \n\nIW: WELL, his number is 07-\n\nMe: I cannot contact the account holder as I am an inbound advisor only. \n\n(I could, but fuck you lady.) \n\nIW: Well, he is at work and my children need to do their homework! What are you going to do to fix this? \n\nMe: Ma’am, as I have already stated, I cannot discuss this matter any further with you due to GDPR as you are not the account holder. To do so would be breaking the law and result in a large fine for myself, as well as possibly losing my job and serious jail time, and I am not prepared to do this. I will be terminating this call now. \n\nIW: FINE. BYE. \n\nWhat I really wanted to say? \n\n1) it’s not my fault you and your husband are shit parents that didn’t have the kids do their homework at the start or during the holidays where they had internet access if it was needed, instead of letting them leave it til the last minute on a SUNDAY. \n\n2) Pay. Your. Fucking. Bills. On. Time. ",
