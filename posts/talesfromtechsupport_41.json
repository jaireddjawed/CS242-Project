        "text": "This is one fine moment that shows that you need actually competent people in IT departments, even if you outsource most of the IT-related activities and services.\n\nThis happens years ago, when a client was in the process of gradually restricting password expiration policies in their domain. We're talking about a client with at least 4000 active users.\n\nThough DumbClient had outsourced system administrators in charge of managing their servers, including domain controllers, they insisted to be in charge of certain things in AD. They had domain passwords expiring every 120 days and wanted to lower it to 90 days. Fair enough. I asked, as the supervisor of the first-level help desk, to be notified in advance about the planning, and I suggested to roll out the new GP gradually to prevent users from getting locked out.\n\nGuess what happened.\n\nYeah, that was easy. \n\nDumbClient rolled out the policy first thing in the morning on all the users, locking out everyone whose password was in the 90 to 120 days timeframe. The phones in our help desk literally exploded and we literally couldn't keep up with the number of users calling. DumbClient also applied the policy to some accounts which where set on \"Password never expires\" (accounts connected to specific machinery that obviously stopped working).\n\nDumbClient refused to acknowledge the problem and instead complained about us being too slow, because people were calling his office to report that we didn't call back or our lines were always busy. Well, considering that YOU made the mistake and your help desk is working on fixing it instead of you, how about you shut the f*** up? We opened 10x our usual number of tickets that day and I had to reroute two on site techs to take tours of the offices to ask people if they needed help.\n\nDumbClient also wasted our time by demanding to be updated each 30 minutes on:\n\n- how many calls did we receive about this problem\n- how many tickets did we open\n- how many times did we call the sysadmins to request a solution\n- how many calls came from senior managers\n\nAll of this by phone, while complaining we were too slow.\n\nDumbClient was really infuriating, but now that I don't deal with anymore, I have a lot of stories to tell..",

        "text": "Hey, first time posting on tfts, and its already a really sad one. \nMy part-time job is at my university at the helpdesk, 1^st level, like really basic student problems (\"why is my WLAN not working?\" and such). Mind you I work in 10 hour shifts from 8am to 6pm, and this call happend around ~5.30pm, and I am the only person left in the office. \n\n\nThe protagonists of this story are $me and $cb (crybaby). \n\n\n&gt; **$me**: Hey, this is Uni-It, how may I help you?\n\n&gt; **$cb**: Look, I am really stressed, I need to get into my account ASAP - I haven't paid my tuition yet. But I neither know username nor password.\n\n\nQuick look on the Date, it was one day before due date, meaning: if she doesn't pay her tuition now, she will be removed from the register for one whole semester. *deep breath*\n\n\n&gt; **$me**: Look, it's really late, and I'm not allowed to share such sensitive data over the telephone, but if you're quick you could come over and I'll reset your password. \n\n&gt; **$cb**: but I am not even in Town, i am in *town approx 3 hours away*, can you pleeeease make an exception? \n\nI proceed to explain why I can't and that I am really sorry, but I cannot do much without proper identification. She proceeds to tell me she will send me everything via E-Mail and if that isnt enough. I tell her more than once, that I am not allowed to do such things, but she could send an Email to the Office of Student Affairs, and that they usually reset passwords over the phone or Mail (because they have more insight in the personal data such as social security number while I only see a name). And all of a sudden the call stops, probably her phone went dead or something. \n\n~~honestly I am relieved because I was getting real uncomfortable and she got more and more aggressive~~\n\nBut little did I know...\n\nShe called seven (!) more times this evening, me picking up the some time, not closely paying attention to the phone number. \n\n&gt; **$me**: Hey, this is Uni-It, how may I help you?\n\n&gt; **$cb** starts laughing: You'll not be very happy that you got me on the phone again. \n\nWell... I wasn't, same scenario from before, I tell her, I can't reset her password if she isn't physically in front of me, she gets very aggressive, cursing, telling me she doesn't even study at my university, just paying tuition at my university because she gets it back easier. \n\nAt this point I am stunned: she doesn't even study here, but expects me to work against my university's policy and risking my job just because she litterally waited to the last second to pay. \n\nAt some point she even started crying, *begging* me. Also cursing and swearing and telling me I am useless and the whole IT is useless. And I feel truly sorry for her, but also I got a little angry myself. \n\nAgain: look at the clock: 6:04. \n\n&gt; **$me**: I am sorry but I can't help you with this problem. \n\n*aggressivly smashes the disconnect call button* \n\nfelt like crying too\n\nEDIT: formatting",

We’ve got a blizzard comin’!”\n\nI rushed aboard the Austrailian-tagged CH-47 Chinook and took a seat towards the front left, directly behind the forward left door gunner.  I placed my toolbox in front of me, settled in best as I could while trying hard to keep warm in the steadily dropping temperature and waited for lift-off, praying we’d make it out ahead of the storm.\n\n***\n\n*Eight hours earlier…*\n\n*Kandahar, Afghanistan*\n\n*April*\n\n&gt;**$SquadLeader**  “Hey, Zee, wanna go on a DART?”\n\nI perked up from the book I was reading.  I’d just come back from leave after being “voluntold” I’d be the first one back in the US for two weeks of leave a month after we arrived in Afghanistan, so I was wanting to get back into things.  Unfortunately, there hadn’t been too much to do as of late, so I was instead bored out of my mind.  I’d managed to get my hands on *Ghost*, by John Ringo, right before I returned from leave and I was currently chewing through the book—at least as much as I could stomach, since I wasn’t a fan of….well, I’d say a good third to half of the book.  But I liked Ringo, so I had just kept reading.  \n\nHowever, a Downed Aircraft Recovery Team mission sounded like a good change of pace, and maybe I’d even be able to actually do some Army stuff.  I leapt to my feet, excited.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** Of course, Sergeant!  What’s going on, and when do I go?”\n\n&gt;**$Squadleader** TGT problem on a Medivac bird in Qalat.  *(Note: Pronounced “Kah-lot”…I think.)*  They want to leave in fifteen minutes, so grab your tools and get over there.”\n\nI didn’t hesitate, just grabbed my toolbox, body armor, magazines, helmet, rifle and piled everything into the gator, alongside $OldManPrivate who would be driving and drop me off.  It was a pleasant, warm Kandahar day, so I didn’t even think about running back to my room to pick up my jacket or gloves.  This would prove shortly to be a huge mistake.  \n\nWhen we arrived at the Medivac Company’s Operations Hut, I learned that I would be accompanying one of their crew chiefs and we’d be flying there aboard a UH-60 Blackhawk.  We loaded our tools and parts onto the helicopter and very shortly departed, under escort by a pair of AH-64 Apache Gunships.  As we gained altitude, I realized how cold I was getting.  Luckily, the crew chief had brought an extra silkweight long-underwear shirt, so I put that on which at least mitigated the cold slightly.  \n\nAfter an hour or so of flight, we descended into the Forward Operating Base Qalat, at the edge of a section of the Himalayas.  As soon as we’d offloaded, our ride lifted off, leaving us needing to get the [broken Blackhawk](https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/190733_17234149800_9395_n.jpg?oh=59d77e4efc20287e7b710eb4956bf260&amp;oe=5AFAF396) fixed if we wanted to get out of there.   It was still terribly cold, but I immediately set to work, investigating the issue with the Turbine (exhaust) Gas Temperature system.  I found out quickly from the aircrew there it was the dreaded ‘TGT Fluctuation’ issue—which likely meant there was nothing wrong with the engine at all, and everything wrong with the wiring/computer in the helicopter itself.  \n\n\nOf course, I did my due diligence and checked the engine over anyway and found it was just as I expected—perfectly fine.  The problem was aircraft-side-likely a pushed-pin.   I shared my results with the flight crew and crew chief I’d flown with, and they took several minutes to confer.  One pilot departed for the operations center and made a call back to Kandahar.   I, meanwhile, did my best to keep warm while waiting and putting my tools away.\n\nWhen the pilot returned, he conferred again with the rest of their team, and then the crew chief I flew with came over to tell me what was going on.\n\n&gt;**$CrewChief**  “Well, good news and bad news.  We’ve gotten permission to one-time flight it back to Kandahar.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Great, what’s the bad news?”\n\n&gt;**$CrewChief** “Since you’re not air crew, it’s not safe for you to fly with us.  You’ll have to stay here.”\n\nThey left immediately, leaving me alone in Qalat with one of their flight medics.  \n\n&gt;**$FlightMedic**  “Don’t worry, there’s a helicopter coming in a couple hours.”\n\nI was led over to the chow hall, where I got my lunch and warmed up, and then I waited.  \n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.  \n\nAt one point, I [looked out at the mountains](https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/196583_17234144800_8959_n.jpg?oh=ca0d6ea5a533819efd0392353189b73a&amp;oe=5AEA984D) and saw the sky steadily growing angrier and whiter.  Growing up in the North, I could recognize what I was seeing:  There was a blizzard coming.  Suddenly, $FlightMedic appeared.\n\n&gt;**$FlightMedic** Hurry up, get your stuff to the pad!  Your ride is coming in hot, and they want to be out in five minutes to beat the storm.  If they can’t, they’re grounded and you’re going to be spending at least a week here!”\n\nThat was all the motivation I needed to be waiting on the pad when a CH-47 appeared from the sky-soup which had been closing in around us.  The wind was picking up and a few flurries were even beginning to fly.  For a moment I basked in the heat of the engine exhaust as the helicopter landed in front of me.  The tailgate dropped and a man popped out.\n\n&gt;**$AussieCrewman**  “Oiy, mates, ‘urry up!  We’ve got a blizzard comin’!”\n\nI rushed aboard the Austrailian-tagged CH-47 Chinook and took a seat towards the front left, directly behind the forward left door gunner.  I placed my toolbox in front of me, settled in best as I could while trying hard to keep warm in the steadily dropping temperature and waited for lift-off, praying we’d make it out ahead of the storm.\n\nWe lifted off within that five minute window, military refugees from the little nowhere-FOB packed in amongst the hastily loaded cargo like sardines.  The wind was cold, next to the door gunner and his window, and I was getting pelted by sleet and snow.  I looked down the length of the bird’s interior and saw the [tailgate was still down…](https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/190301_17234139800_8514_n.jpg?oh=ffadb2e374aeef3a47c4f7dca9a9e023&amp;oe=5AF6F2D4)\n\n..and could recognize that we were flying very, very fast, nap of the earth, in a frigging blizzard.  \n\nI forgot I was cold and instead hung on for dear life.  \n\n***\n\nArrival in Kandahar was much, much warmer, and I was thankful to be back.  Of course, I didn’t exactly thank $Squadleader, who was laughing at my lack of cold weather gear the whole time.  \n\nAs for the bird?  Well, I didn’t hear a peep about her, [at least for another month….](https://redd.it/71kt0w)\n\n[*The full archive of tales can be found here…*](https://redd.it/7i0esb)\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Wear a coat when flying into mountains in the spring.

        "text": "So in my previous post I explained that I worked for POS (Point of Sale) company that for a while doing everything from installs, phone/remote support and hardware repair (essentially a level 2) - mainly for restaurants.  This story really took the cake.\n\nWe had a very large corporate customer (3000 employees in one building) that had a cafeteria on the ground level that was open for breakfast and lunch every weekday as well as being open to the public during that time.  Needless to say they did a lot of business.  When processing credit cards on this system they were always setup to automatically batch at the end of business each day.  Once done a report would spit out with all the totals.  Things were going fine for about a year until they called us in a panic.  They were saying they weren't getting their money from the credit card company and asked us to check into it.  Now what you have to understand with these systems is they are set to batch each night, but if something was wrong with the batch it would not let any future batches go through.  This was designed purposefully because normally businesses would notice when not getting credit card deposits if they just flat stop coming, rather than one missed occasionally.  \n\nSo as I was the first one in the office that morning I assigned myself the ticket and gave them a call and confirmed that credit cards seem to be working and authorizing but don't seem to be closing.  So I get permission to dial in and am flabbergasted at what I find...their credit cards haven't batched for a little over 3 months!  I sat there stunned until the customer asked if I knew what was wrong.  I ended up telling him it looks like the batches aren't going through and that I needed to check something and would call him back.\n\nI got onto the phone with my boss and one of our level 3 techs and discussed this with them.  They ended up dialing in and taking a look themselves. Turns out there was a little over $1million in batches that had not processed.  So we advise the customer of the issue and get them to realize the seriousness of this situation and begin to get to work.\n\nWhat would have normally been a 5 minute phone call when it first happened took two full days of both the level 3 and myself crawling through each batch to figure out if they would go through, because just having one batch be bad would be too simple.  Turns out there were a lot of cards that ended up being declined for NSF or expired cards - the works.  \n\nOnce it was all said and done there was over $50,000 worth of charges that couldn't be processed for one reason or another and they really couldn't do anything about it.  I know they had a lot of blowback from the credit card company for people doing chargebacks due to the sheer number of charges some people were getting that they thought weren't correct.  I also heard through the grapevine the accountant responsible for checking credit card statements got a reaming as well as the cafeteria manager (because they weren't checking to make sure they were receiving the reports properly).  We ended up having a meeting with some higher ups and had to get paperwork signed for a custom alert policy that would let us know if their credit cards did not batch from the night before. \n\nWe now have a new form specifically for credit card processing with new customers that goes into detail about how they work and what they are responsible for (previously we had a checklist and it was merely a line that we had reviewed this with the customer)\n\nTLDR: Customer didn't batch over $1million worth of credit cards in a 3 month period - ended up loosing $50,000 worth of sales and making a lot of people angry.",

        "text": "Back with another tale from $OnlineSchool, and this one made me wish that I could strangle the user through the phone (a common wish, if stories here hold true). \n\n*A bit of background for those not familiar: I'm a Student Support Specialist for $OnlineSchool, where adults who never finished High School can complete their requirements and get their High School diploma, instead of settling for a GED. Most of our students are middle-aged/older, and have trouble with some of our technology and systems. I'm not tech support, but I am tasked with helping with \"simple\" solutions.*\n\n$404 - Your tall, dark, and handsome protagonist\n\n$FL (Fax Lady) - A student trying desperately to send a fax\n\nThe phone rings, and $404 rattles off the greeting spiel with the same unconscious monotone he usually reserves for praying the Hail Mary and ordering his dessert of choice (\"Vanilla vodka, cranberry juice, simple syrup, ice\"). $FL comes on the line with the ungodly screech of a fax machine trying to connect in the background.\n\n&gt;$FL: I keep trying to send the documents you guys asked for with my fax machine at work, and it keeps telling me it can't connect. I want to make sure I have the right number.\n\nOff the bat, $404 is pretty happy. $FL isn't blaming anyone, she's looking to fix the problem instead of complain about it. Over-all, it's starting to sound like a pleasant call. $404's guard lowers.\n\n&gt;$404: Well, let's get a look at your account first of all, because if I have to escalate this to IT, they're going to need your information. *Blah, blah, verify, blah* Ok, what fax number are you trying to send it to?\n\n&gt;$FL: *Reads off our main office fax number correctly* Is that right?\n\n&gt;$404: Yes, that's correct. I'm going to give you the supervisor's fax line, see if that one works for you. *Gives fax number for supervisor desk*\n\n$404 hears $FL typing the number into the fax machine, and more horrific screeching. He closes his eyes and thinks of his happy place.\n\n&gt;$FL: It still isn't connecting. Are your fax machines down?\n\n$404 messages his IT guy on $messengerApp, and is told there isn't anything wrong with the fax machines. In fact, one had a fax coming in as they spoke.\n\n&gt;$404: No, Ma'am, nothing wrong with our fax machines, they're functioning well. Is it possible there is something wrong with yours?\n\n$404 should not have asked this question, and he realized it shortly after $FL *huffed* loudly.\n\n&gt;$FL: It's *not* my fax machine. I use it all day, every day for work, it works just fine. There must be something wrong at your offices.\n\n&gt;$404: Well, I have a good way of figuring out where the problem is. Do you have another fax machine there in your office?\n\n&gt;$FL: Yes, I do. \n\n&gt;$404: I'll send a test fax from my fax machine to another in my office, and you send one from your machine to the other one in your office, and then we'll be able to figure out which one has the problem.\n\n&gt;$FL: It's obvious that the problem is on your end, but fine.\n\n$404 sends a test fax from his machine to the fax machine in the Education department. It goes through as smooth as butter. He also hears the fax machine on $FL's end going through its terrifying mating call of death (and swears that $FL's fax machine is actually some kind of prehistoric monster). \n\n&gt;$FL: It didn't go through! You people broke my fax machine! Now I have to try on the other one, and that's all the way across the building! \n\n&gt;$404: Why don't you just scan it to your computer and email it to us? It'll be a lot faster and easier that way.\n\n&gt;$FL: Are you kidding? This document has all sorts of personal information on it. Fax is the only secure way to send it. I'll be sending it from the other fax machine, but I'm going to have someone come look at this one, and if your machine damaged mine, I'll be looking for restitution. *Hangs up*\n\n$404 stares at his web-phone and silently wishes for a case of beer to magically appear under his desk. His wish is not granted.\n\nThe phone rings.",

Few more minutes has passed, poorly drawn doodles on my post-its are made.\n\nThis entire time I've heard background noises of them talking to other people.\n\nI glance at the call timer on my phone, just a little over 10 minutes has gone by. At this point, the issue should've been resolved and the call over with.\n\n**$Me:** Are you ready?\n\n**$Customer:** Oh yes I've been waiting blah blah blah rant rant rant \n\nI don't even bother arguing at this point, you ask me to wait and then complain you were waiting?",

        "text": "This is a conversation that I have at least once a week it seems, but today really was an outstanding example.\n\nI offer support for a suite of software used by businesses. The software is powered by a server the clients have on-site. This conversation happened about an hour ago. SLG = me, Hack the Planet (HTP) = end user.\n\n&gt; **SLG**: Support, how can I help you?\n&gt; \n&gt; **HTP**: Yeah, ever since friday when the software blew up on us we aren't able to print to our invoice printer. Getting real tired of this, you guys are always breaking these printers on us and never fix it when I call!\n\nLooking through cases on account, they never called us about anything on Friday...\n\n&gt;**SLG**: That doesn't sound good, are you able to print to that printer from outside of the software? Via notepad or a word document for example.\n&gt;\n&gt;**HTP**: *sigh* YES! We've been having to email the documents to ourselves and printing from there since Friday, you guys need to fix this issue because it's reaaaaaally slowing us down here.\n&gt;\n&gt;**SLG**: Okay, if you don't mind I'd like to get remoted into your computer and check it out.\n\n7 minutes later of them not understanding our 7 letter URL and the corresponding confirmation code to allow me into their computer. First thing I see is they are running our software from a terminal server which is pretty normal. I immediately see the print icon in the system tray, hover over it already knowing what I'm going to see: 82 print jobs in queue from various users to the effected printer. I can't even clear the queue because the user doesn't have privileges to do so, let alone privileges to modify/add/delete printers.\n\nFor laughs I try to print from a notepad and all that does is increase the queue to 83.\n\n&gt;**SLG**: I see the problem here. It looks like something got a little goofed on your terminal server and-\n\n&gt;**HTP**: I know that's why I'm calling you guys! You need to fix the server so I can print!\n\n&gt;**SLG**: Ma'am, the terminal server is not related to our software at all and is managed by I assume your local IT company. Nobody here at [Company Support] has access to fix what needs to be fixed here.\n\nThis devolved into a 5 minute conversation about where our software ends and where their environment begins before...\n\n&gt;**HTP**: I don't care if I don't have the credentials, can't you just hack the printer? Isn't that what you tech guys do all day?\n&gt;\n&gt;**SLG**: Ma'am, [that's not how this works](http://e.lvme.me/pzv5j7l.jpg). I've already mentioned that we literally cannot fix this issue and you need to contact whoever set up your terminal server so they can fix the printer.\n&gt;\n&gt;**HTP**: But you guys gave us the server!\n&gt;\n&gt;**SLG**: (apparently the 5 minutes of explaining what a terminal server is and how it's different from the server they have on-site that runs our software didn't just happen) Trust me on this HTP, if you call your IT company and explain the situation they'll have it fixed in 5 to 10 minutes. There is nothing I can do for you.\n&gt;\n&gt;**HTP**: FINE! Just like always, you guys are worthless. *click*\n\nThe call lasted a total of about 20 minutes. If she had just called their local IT company they could have had it fixed in less time than that. Most likely the printer IP got changed when they lost power on Friday (that was our software \"blowing up\") and they needed to update it on the domain, a 2 minute fix.\n",

        "text": "In my previous story someone made a comment about users constantly breaking stuff and blaming the network techs. To no surprise, of course, there is a story about that.\n\n*****\n\n**The Setup**\n\nRemember, in [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/), i said how my employer is developing stuff for cars using massive amounts of video and radar data? And how all of it runs on a network where there is no connection below 10GBit? \n\nWell, there was a recent addition. Someone requested a few special parking spaces for cars. Special as in: 10GBit connection right next to it. Because they have this trunk-filling setup of diagnostic, telemetry and development systems in a few cars from which they need to shovel data into the datacenter as fast as possible without having to rip out drives out of the in-car computers and carry them inside.\n\nThey asked for it, i delivered. The ports were set up as regular access ports, which means: Host limit and BPDU-Guard. Which basically equals to: You can't connect switches to these ports. If you do, the port will go into error-disabled state and not come back up by its own.\n\nGuess what they forgot to mention when asking me for those ports?\n\n**The People**\n\n$FCM: One of our facility managers. Small old lady who drives a 2008 Ford Mustang Bullitt, so you can probably guess her personality.\n\n$Eng: An automotive engineer, working with the cars and systems mentioned above.\n\n$Phrewfuf: Do i really need to mention that every time?\n\n*****\n\n**Day 1**\n\n0800 AM. $Phrewfuf is sitting at his desk, sipping hot black coffee...the third one that day. Opening the red-light district aka the monitoring. An orange alert pops up. \"BPDU-GUARD_BPDU-RECV on Port Gi0/1. Port went into ERR-DIS mode.\" Alert source? The switch providing network to the parking lot. Either someone looped two ports to each other or connected a switch.\n\nSurprisingly, no ticket to be found about it. Eh, whatever.\n\n**Day 10**\n\n1000 AM. $Phrewfuf is sitting at his desk, sipping hot black coffee. The red-light district is already open. Another orange alert. Same as on Day 1, but for Port Gi0/2, which is the second port on the switch.\n\nTickets: none. Eh, whatever.\n\n**Day 25**\n\n0200 PM. The coffee machine is broken. $Phrewfuf had to walk 20 meters further to the next one. After coming back and taking another sip...Gi0/3 error-disabled.\n\nHm...quick dialing $FCM.\n\n&gt; $FCM: Hi, what's up?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hey, quick question, did you get any messages or mails regarding the parking lot?\n\n&gt; $FCM: Nope. Why?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: They're doing...something and managed to disable three out of four available ports. \n\n&gt; $FCM: Huh. Well, they still have one, so it's either fine or not too urgent.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Eh, whatever. They'll start crying about it eventually.\n\n**Day 40**\n\n0930 AM. The coffee machine has been fixed. Orange alert, Gi0/4 error-disabled. I sit there and wait until my phone rings 10 minutes later.\n\n&gt; $FCM: Hi, remember that call we had about the parking lot?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Yup...let me guess, you got a mail from them?\n\n&gt; $FCM: Exactly, how do you know?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...monitoring tells me they just killed their last port. Throw me their email, i'll take care of it.\n\n\nCalling $Eng.\n\n&gt; $Eng: This is $Eng, are you calling because of the network? *He saw my department in Skype*\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi, this is $Phrewfuf. Yup, i am. Do you have some time to get to the parking lot and fix it? I'll need to take a look at your setup.\n\n&gt; $Eng: Sure, when do you have time for it? Is it possible to get it done today? We need to push some data.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well, i was thinking about right now, i'll just grab my note and walk over to you. In 5 minutes at the lot?\n\n&gt; $Eng: Oh?! Yeah, that's perfect.\n\nThe two meet up at the parking lot, two very nice cars are parking there. Nice despite the fact that there are sensors sticking out in a very strange, hacked manner. After asking to, $Eng proceeds to open the trunk of one of the cars and the first thing $Phrewfuf spots is a slight mess of network cables connected to a switch.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Welp. I knew it. Those switches, who set them up?\n\n&gt; $Eng: My predecessor. He built the systems for the cars, but left before they came to real use.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: I see...did he leave any docu, especially how to configure the switches? We need to apply some changes.\n\n&gt; $Eng: Sure, i'll just connect my box to them.\n\nA few moments later, Spanning-Tree - loop protection, sends BPDU packets which my switches do not like - is disabled on the in-car switches and the ports are reenabled. A quick test shows that all is working fine.\n\n&gt; $Eng: Nice! Now we can transfer all the data, we couldn't do it for a month or so.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...you should've contacted IT-Support earlier, then i could've fixed it then. THen you wouldn't have to panic because of your deadlines. Just open a ticket next time something's wrong.\n\n&gt; $Eng: Yeah...will do. Thanks a lot for your help.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: And please update all the switches in all your cars please. And add the current config to the docu, in case someone else ends up taking over from you.\n\n**TL;DR:** Clean your filthy thing before trying to stick it in the next hole.\n\n*****\n\nPrevious Stories:\n\n* [Don't do the thing - Oops, i did the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4eqzlr/guys_dont_do_the_thing_it_breaks_stuff_oh_i_did/)\n\n* [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/)\n\n* [Personality issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ie176/netnotworking_personality_issues/)\n\n* [Internet of Sh...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7juazk/netnotworking_internet_of_sh/)",

        "text": "A friend of mine was complaining about the ever-increasing performance issues with her computer, a ten-inch netbook that was sort-of okay when it was new but is now hopelessly inadequate, so I bought her a tablet for Christmas. Nothing fancy, just a generic 7-inch Android one that she can play Pearl's Peril and do the grocery shopping on and fit in her handbag. She was absolutely thrilled with it and gave me a huge hug and then we had a very merry Christmas dinner indeed.\n\nFast forward for today, when we're both sat on her sofa after a large Sunday lunch watching *Columbo* and chatting about nothing in particular, and she asks me if I could have a look at the new tablet because it's been playing her up.\n\nThis is the point where most techies probably groan inwardly and steel themselves for a lot of aggro, but this friend of mine is the sort of person I'd love to have as an end user; she's always polite and respectful when she needs help, she listens to what I tell her and rarely needs to have something explained to her twice. Besides, I'd been paid up-front in home-cooked food and some very nice wine... and as it turned out, I'd created the problem in the first place!\n\nAfter a bit of a fumble trying to find the matte black power button on the glossy black case, it was exactly as described. The tablet booted to the unlock screen and then poof! Powered straight off. Thinking to eliminate the most obvious explanation first, I asked her if she could go get the charger in case the battery was just low.\n\n\"Charger?\" she replied, confused. \"Everything that came with it is right here.\"\n\nIt was then I remembered that before I wrapped it up, I'd taken the tablet out of the box and plugged it in so it would have a full battery for when she started using it on Christmas Day. I had also somehow managed to buy a model that will only charge via a pinhole-sized socket for a mains cable, and not through the mini-USB connector she had quite reasonably supposed was for power as well as data and plugged into a mains adapter. Luckily that seems not to have done the tablet any actual harm.\n\nFortunately she saw the funny side, but I still owe her a new charger if I can't find the wretched thing.",

        "text": "**Intro:**\n\nSo  I  work for possibly the largest cloud-storage provider in Scandinavia as part of the tech support team.  This is fine, and I like my job.    However,  sometimes  I fear for us humans in general.  I will skip over the most boring parts, since these cases often get slightly ugly (this was no exception), but all relevant info will be included in a simple form.  This is not necessarily  a happy story, but should be a reminder for everyone paying for similar services.   **TL;DR  provided at the bottom.**   \n\n*Last week, be me, storytime.*\n\n\nI (Me)  , see a ticket from &lt;Customer&gt;  in our support system of choice,   I'm about to end my shift in 30 minutes, but in any case where we see potential risk of data-loss ,We will prioritize it, and check status quo.\n\n**Customer:**  Hi,  my account is gone and we have not received a e-mail about this. Seems like it expired in July.  Is it possible to do a restore?\n\n\nI immediately  know that this could turn into a long chat, but I still do the initial checkup ,seeing that this will take me 30 seconds.\n\n**Me:** Hi,  this account was sadly terminated back to  0GB  since we have not received payment  since July.  You should however have received multiple e-mails warning you about this   (I did not have back-end present during the night-shift).    Is  &lt;E-mail&gt;  the correct adress?\n\n**Customer:**  Hi,  yes.  The domain should only do redirects, but it seems it has not done this.\n\n**Ta-da!**   Malconfigured e-mail servers,   exactly why I dont host one for critical stuff.\n\nI continued to tell her how our payment lockdowns worked (7 days for write, 14 for read and 120 for termination,  this is the first scream test.) , when we received the last payment, that we had registered a CC-Change in 2015, but that later the new card was declined when the yearly plan was due for renewal  , and the account later terminated  120 days after payment due date, even though the ToS state 90 days (Second scream test/ extra unofficial buffer.)   Seeing how she was over our 5GB free limit when this happened all data was gone, since we cannot prioritize which data  should be kept.  \n\nCustomer continues about how she was not warned, and that we should have a in-app warning.  (Which we do have for all our local versions, but its up to the reseller to enable it in some cases,  this was not one of them.)  She is slightly frustrated, understandably enough.\n\nI respond about how the service was running \"for free\" for about 3.5 months after the lockdown date before  we actually delete  the data.   (120 days in total and about 500GB in this case.)  And how we sadly cannot keep this data forever since we cannot deliver a service that is not paid for by the customer.   We say this date is 90 days in the ToS, but I made it clear that we actually delete for good about 30 days later,  within the hour in most cases.\n\n\n\nSo again *120 days/4 months /  1/3 of a year.*    This is also the de-facto date that their rights as a customer vanishes completely and the point where this process cannot be reversered.\n\n**In other words:**  The data is long gone being deleted back in the beginning of november,  and was in the delete queue for a maximum of 12 hours.   Automation ftw!    We can do exceptions if warned  before this date, but hindsight will do nothing here. *Its gone. Period.*\n\n\n\n**Customer:**  This is meaningless,   and unacceptable.    &lt;Competitor&gt; had warnings via sms.\n\n\n(**My mind:**  And so do we?    Seems like you have tried these tactics before then?)   \n\nNot to mention that we dont deliver data to  NSA behind their backs, since WE are not legally required to do so. Unlike &lt;Competitor&gt; who both has a history doing this and will never comply with the new EU  GDPR laws until they are forced, but hey each to their own I guess.  Keep in mind that I did not say this to the customer.  I just find it funny.\n\n\nThis is where I want to end the case,  seeing that the data is long gone, and we technically cannot do anything more for the customer but deliver any logs when the correct department is present.\n\nI always find it strange that they do not react when the feedback from the client is not present for this time.  Seeing how its both write, and read locked.\n\n\nCustomer then wants the logs,  mad as hell  and demanding her data back.  I send the ones I can give  immediately, and tell her that the rest will be sent over ASAP.\n\nCustomer then gives me a poor rating on the way out where she blames ME for deleting her data.     \n\n **Nice™**.   *Fingerguns*\n\nThe Back-end  team sends mail logs the following day  (18 in total related to the case,  7 related to the last payment, , 3 payment reminders  and one last warning before we sent delete confirmation),  and the  logs from our card-payment provider.   \n\nWas later  determined that the cause  was   Error 0.  AKA card does not work,  and that the reason for this was that it had expired in **2016.**    The service was running happily along since she had a yearly payment plan until July, but after due date the 120 day limit was in effect and counting down.\n\n\nI never heard back from her.\n\n\n\n**Tl;DR:**\nCustomer did not pay for cloud storage,  data was deleted  and the customer then blamed us.  Even when the service  was assigned this expired card for 11 months in total.\n\n\n**So what did we learn?**\n\n\n1. Pay your bills kids.   \n\n2. Dont host your own email if you dont know what you're doing, vital emails could be lost this way.\n\n3.  Change any expired cards for services you want to keep when they expire, and not after the service is terminated underneath your feet, especially crisis-oriented ones like a cloud service.\n\n4. Read the ToS  before you blame the company, otherwise it could be embarrassing for you.\n\n\n\nHave a great day.\n\nEdit: formatting, typos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Warning long.  Really long.  TLDR at the bottom.\n\n\nThis happened not too long ago and I'm changing some of the details just in case... \n\n\n**The cast and crew:**\nMr. Yonderboy:  Your intrepid story teller.  \nIT Guy:  The client's Vice President of Information Technology.  Also their one and only technical resource. \nVendor:   A really cool vendor from out of state.  There with a USB drive in hand to finish up a multi-month project.   \n\n\n**The backstory:**\nWe provide out-sourced IT to this client and are responsible for managing their old infrastructure that runs their main line of business application.  This integrates with a portion of their website and is used by all of their clients and well as all of their staff.  \n\n\nWe were responsible for deploying a physical host server (a massive beast - retail cost over $120k - 24 Cores, 512GB RAM, SSD SAS drives, NVMe PCIe adapters, Tesla GPUs, the works) and about 20 VMs on it to support the new version of their app.  Over a hundred users would be connecting via RDP to VDI sessions on it, it'd be running a couple SQL databases and multiple application servers as well as a couple different web front ends.  It's a pretty complex application with tons of moving parts.  \n\n\nAnyway.  This was during the development phase.   Four different vendors were involved of which we were just one.  We were in charge of the overall project management, however, and had a financial incentive (read penality clause) in the contract if things were not ready on time.   Everything was going great, things were on track and on time.   We had set up a management VM for the client to do all the work they needed to do - manage the host and all the various VMs.  We also set up a management workstation 15 feet from the server in their server room with an RDP shortcut to that VM and a shortcut to the iDRAC (out of band management tool for remote control, rebooting, etc.).    We gave the client's IT guy a full day's training on how to access the server via the management VM from his desk and from the management workstation... All is well.  \n\n\nOn the day that everything imploded one of the vendors had flown in from out of state to do the final code-drop of their portion of the software on their VMs.  They'd been remotely accessing the system for weeks at this point so I'm unsure why they flew in - maybe for a free lunch and beers after work - who knows.   Anyway, we were standing by to assist.   \n\n\nAt this time there were two other groups of vendors logged on to various VMs including a group of developers doing whatever it is that developers do.   A SQL DBA was also running a process to convert the existing information from the old system to the new system.   I'm a bit fuzzy about exactly what was going on but I know it was taking quite a bit of time and due to limitations on the source system pausing and resuming the process was not possible... Or at least not they way it was being done.  \n\n\nThe client themselves also had over a dozen people logged on to the system doing integration and QA testing.   All in all there were upwards of 30 people actively working on various aspects of the system.  \n\n\nThis was Friday.  It was due to go live on Sunday evening / Monday morning.   \n\n\nThe vendor on-site told the IT guy that he needed to 'log on to the server' so, instead of going to the management workstation, or connecting from his desk, the IT guy grabs some dusty old monitor from somewhere, plugs it in to the host, along with keyboard and mouse and then calls me when it doesn't work... \n\n&gt; IT Guy:  \"Mr. Yonderboy, I've plugged a monitor into the server and I'm not getting a picture.  Something is wrong with it.  I think it's crashed!\"\n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Well, I'm remotely connected to it now so I'm confident it's up and running.  Why are you plugging a monitor into it?\"  \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"The ~~highly paid consultant from out of state that is here to buy us lunch and beer~~ vendor is here to install their final code drop and needs access to the server.\"\n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Well, nobody needs to log on to the host.  Why not just have him use the management workstation there in the computer room?\"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy:  \"He says he needs access to the server.  He didn't say anything about a workstation...\" \n\n\n&gt; Me:  \"He's been accessing his VMs remotely all this time.  He can log on to the management workstation to access them from there.\"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy:  \"There is something wrong with the server.  I need your help getting it working.  It has no video.\"\n\n\n&gt; Me: (internal sigh) \"Alrighty.  Are you plugging into the port on the front or back of the server?  We tested them both when we had the server in our shop so they should both work but try whichever one you're not currently plugged in to.\"\n\n\n&gt;IT Guy: \"Oh, there is one in the front?  Yeah, let me try that.\" \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Make sure you tap a key on the keyboard or move the mouse to make sure the server wakes up the display.\" \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Yeah, it's still not working.  I'm going to need someone to come down here and figure out why this server you sold us is not working.   This is pretty time sensitive as this vendor is here from out of state and can't work.\" \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"You can get him connected via the management workstation across the room from you.\"  \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy:  \"Back to this?  He needs to get **on the server** not on some workstation.\" \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"The *servers* he needs access to are all VMs running on that host.  They can be accessed using the Hyper-V console on the management workstation or directly via RDP from the management workstation.  Logging on to the host directly gets you absolutely nothing that can't be done from the from that workstation.   If he needs direct access to the host that can be done via the iDRAC icon on the desktop of that machine, also.\"  \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy:  \"I think the server is broken.  Should I try restarting it?\" \n\n\n&gt; Me:  \"**NO!** Please do not restart the server.  We've got a lot of people logged on now doing various tasks.  We'd need to schedule a downtime and coordinate that with all the other vendors and your testers, also.\"  \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Well, the server is broken, there is no way anybody is working, now.\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"As I said, I'm connected to it, now.  It's definitely working.  Check this out. \"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy:  \"Hey, the CD try just ejected.\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yep, that was me\"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Neat trick.  How'd you do that to a broken server?\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: (barely audible sigh) *realizing that it's a lost cause I decided to give the monitor one last shot before driving down there* \"So, this monitor. Does it have any lights on it?\" \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Yeah, it's got an amber light on the power button.\" \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Okay.  And it's good?  I mean, the monitor works on other systems?  Is this the same one from the KVM in the next rack over?\"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"No, those cables don't reach but yeah this one is good.  I tried it earlier and it worked fine.\"\n\n\n&gt; Me:  \"Okay, Let me hop in the car and head down there.  It's about 8am so traffic is bad and it'll probably take me about 45 mins to get there.  Is **Vendor** available?  Can I talk with him?\"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy puts the vendor on the phone.  I've been talking with him for weeks so we have a rapport.  He's had (remote, obviously) access to the host as he was tweaking some of the settings for his VMs.\n\n\n&gt; Vendor: \"Howdy Mr. Yonderboy!  How goes it?\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"All good!  Looks like I'm headed down there because **IT Guy** is convinced the server is broken even though I've assured him that it's not.   He says you insist you need physical access to the actual host?\"  \n\n\n&gt; Vendor: \"Well, I've got a USB drive that I need to plug in.  It's got all the final production data to copy over.\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Sure, so just plug that in then you can go over to the management workstation - ask **IT Guy** which one that is - and log on to the host so you can map the USB drive through to wherever you need it or just copy it over direct if that's easier.\" \n\n\n&gt; Vendor: \"Seems like **IT Guy** is pretty insistent on getting me set up on this cart here right next to the server for some reason but I'll try to give that a shot.\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Okay, see you in a bit.  Can you put **IT Guy** back on the phone?\"\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Hey?  You on the way?\"\n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yep, be there as soon as possible.   Don't touch anything 'till I get there, alright?\" \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Okay, but you better hurry.  Everyone is pretty pissed off that this fancy new server you sold us is broken.\"\n\n\n&gt; Me: \"I'll be there as soon as possible.\" \n\n\n**The turning point:**\nI grab my stuff and head out the door.  I don't get phone calls or texts while I'm driving for safety (and company policy) reasons but as soon as I park and look at my phone I see I've missed a call from our NOC.   I call them back as I'm heading into the building to see what's up.  I probably should have guessed...\n\n\nTurns out that the client's entire new infrastructure went offline a few minutes after I left the office.   The host and all the VMs.   I check my email - missed call alerts from a couple of the other vendors, the head of the client's testing department and from IT Guy himself. \n\n\nI call IT Guy to let him know I've arrived and am riding the elevator up to the datacenter on the 18th floor.  \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Hey!  Mr. Yonderboy!   Everyone called me to say that the testing servers aren't working.   Where are those located?  You still have those at your offices, right?\"  \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"What do you mean?  Those are virtual machines on that host there in the server room.\" \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"The broken server?  No, that's for **vendor's** part of the app.  That has nothing to do with anything else.\" \n\n\n&gt; Me: \"That's where *everything* runs.  All the servers are on there.  Remember the training?  You saw Hyper-V with the twenty different virtual machines?\" \n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: \"Yeah, that's like VMware on our old systems, right?\"\n\n\n*The elevator is rising.  Somewhat like my blood pressure.   I explained, again, that his old system had six different physical servers, running VMware, with various virtual machines on different hosts.  The new server was much more powerful and everything ran on one host.*\n\n\n&gt; IT Guy: A lightbulb goes off.  Dim, but a lightbulb none the less.  \"Oh... So when I rebooted it everything went down\"\n\n\n&gt; Me:  \"Wait, what?!?  Can you open the door, please?   I'm right outside.\"   \n\n\n*The conversation continues in person.   It turns out that not only did he 'reboot' the server - he power cycled it...  And not by pressing the power button.  That'd do a graceful shut down.   He didn't even hold the power button down for a few seconds to do a forced power off.* \n\n\n**He went to the back of the server and pulled both power cords at once!** \n\n\nOnly decades of customer service and technical support experience allowed me to remain calm.   That and I was wearing a tie - I don't think I could breathe deeply enough to scream.\n\n\n**The aftermath:**\nSome of the development work and testing was interrupted but that was relatively minor.   All of that was minor UI tweaks that could have been completed after go-live if necessary.  \n\n\nThe major problem was that the SQL job that was running failed and had to be restarted.   This did not complete in time and the go-live had to be rescheduled.   The client's CFO and CEO tried to invoke the penalty clause because they'd already printed documentation for their clients and mailed it out letting them know about the new processes and the switchover date and this had to be delayed by a month (something to do with batching and it could only be done at the end of a month)\n\n\nI am very glad that vendor was there to see all of this, specifically IT Guy pulling the power plugs.  He asked him what he was doing and warned him against it, saying that I was on my way and that he'd said he'd not touch anything 'till I got there.  This saved my company significant money.  \n\n\nOh, and that monitor?   It was an old, yellowed with age, LCD panel that IT Guy had pulled out of storage.  It didn't work because it's max resolution was 1024x768 and the server needed a higher resolution display.  It did display \"input out of range\" and when I asked IT Guy why he didn't mention that he said that he \"didn't know what that meant and didn't think it was important.\" \n\n\n**TLDR:** IT Guy reboots live, active host because old crusty LCD monitor displays error message instead of video.  This delays go-live of million dollar project and almost causes penalty clauses to be invoked causing loss of profit and beer money.\n\nEDIT: Formatting is hard.",

        "text": "This happened to a coworker. I'll call him \"Alice\", because why not.\n\nWe were L0/L1 monitoring monkeys, and one of our puppies was a big IBM tape robot/TSM backup server. The backup administrator had it set up to back itself up to an 8mm tape drive in the main host, not to one of the tapes in the robot. He was one of those guys that if you dealt with him during the regular work day was great, but do *NOT* call him after hours if you want to retain the standard number of holes in your butt.\n\nOne weekend, Alice left the monitoring area and went into the very well sound-proofed room where the robot was, to swap the backup tapes. It was about his break time, and he didn't mention he was doing the tapes first, so it would have been a very long time before anybody noticed he was gone.\n\nThe button to eject the tape was a couple of inches from the power button for the entire machine, and the same size and color, a big white square. Alice had the button pushed all the way in before he noticed he was pushing the power button, not the tape eject. As long as he held that button in, it would stay on, and it was super busy.\n\nIt was the '90s, and Alice didn't have a cellphone. The room was extremely well sound proofed, we couldn't hear the yelling. Alice was too short to bang on the glass.\n\nFinally he heaved a big ol' sigh and released the button. To his credit, he swapped lunch breaks with someone else and stuck around to deal with the backup administrator, who had to come in and spend hours getting that damn thing back up and happy.",

Besides my fulltime job as a IT-Support guy in a great company I work as a system administrator for a really small PR-company, four employees and the boss. It’s pretty cool because you get the “hand on” thing and just can tryout things which aren’t possible in the great company. Because of my fulltime job the employees of $PRCompany often contact me through WhatsApp.\n\nShort to the setup in $PRCompany. A Mac OS X Server for Mail and Open Directory and four iMac clients, Apple Mail as E-Mail client. A good advice from my side: Never ever use OSX Server for E-mails, it’s just pain.\n\nOne day I received a Whatsapp that $PREmployee couldn’t use the Apple Mail client as it just won’t synchronize. After a short GoogleFu I thought she maybe had an E-Mail folder with an umlaut (you know the German thing with Ä, Ü, Ö. Since we are in Germany that wouldn’t be a surprise). So I wrote her a Whatsapp message: \n\n&gt; $me: “You haven’t a folder with an umlaut, do you?”\n&gt; $PREmloyee: “What do you mean? Ä Ü Ö ? We have an dictionary here…”\n\nAt this point I just wanted to headdesk. We were talking about E-Mails all the time and then she says she has a dictionary.\n\nA day later I clarified what I mean and that wasn’t the problem. But made me giggle.\n\n**TL;DR:** Asked a user about her E-Mail folders and she offers me a dictionary.\n",

        "text": "Today was a hell day for me. Smooth sailing for the desk as 15 percent of our userbase is still on vacation or doing light work. New years is a lul for mortgages I guess. \n\nSo it all started when I got a session from a user who has having an issue with emails not reaching the exchange server. I had a feeling I knew what the issue was. I asked the user their location and they confirmed it. The largest branch location that *our company* has. \n\nThis office is so large they have their own on site IT team who handle just that office. They have more employees than the tertiary corporate office + the IT annex they built up last year. \n\nSo I check our tech repository and see the notes for this branch. I tell the user I will get back with them and place a call to one of their on site guys. Now this guy I am calling is actually under me. I perform all of my supervisory functions through video with this group of 3 techs and they know me well. \n\n&gt; $Tech - Whats up boss?\n\n&gt; $Me - Hey I need you to check your mail queue, think you got a message hung that is clogging up the tubes. \n\n&gt; $Tech - Lol right one sec. \n\nTwo minutes later. \n\n&gt; $ME - Yo start a session with me I wanna see what exactly you guys do here. \n\nHE starts a session with me as he checks the mail queue. Someone tried deleting the message through their web portal when it was the next in line. It was held because it required an admin to clear it. I thanked god I dont have to deal with such a stupid setup on my end. \n\nThis branch has their own setup because they are so large. They wrote 17 percent of all business last year though. To put that number into perspective. The number 2 performing office wrote 7 percent of the business last year. \n\nI thank my tech and close the session a little too quick. I noticed something odd as the session closed. The web address he was connected to was not an internal address we normally use with a \\\\\\ prefix, but an HTTPS connection. I IM him and ask him to send the link so I can mark it in my notes. He sends it but says it wont do us any good since they had their own domain. \n\nI try it out and confirm it returns a 403 forbidden address. Then go... \"wait 403 forbidden?\" I decide to run a ping test on it and when they went through just fine, I decide to play it safe and send it off to infosec.\n\n*Five minutes later*\n\nOne of the infosec guys comes over to my desk and tells that I need to see this. First thing he does is puts me on the guest wifi to prove this can all be done off domain. He calls over my boss and pulls in the CIO in on a skype call s well. \n\n&gt; $infosec - So the link you sent is being blocked by the server on their end because we do not have local access right?\n\n&gt; $ME - Yeah. But it is an external address though, not an internal one. So its violating the company policy. \n\n&gt; $Infosec - Oh we are well beyond that. \n\n&gt; $CIO - Continue (through skype)\n\n&gt; $Infosec - So if we ping the server, we get the ip address. \n\nYou know that sinking feeling as you know you are about to hear something so stupid, so idiotic, and so fucking obvious that you literally are scared to hear your assumptions realized? That was everyone on the line. \n\n&gt; $infosec - If you simply type in the Ip address you connect to the root folder of their server. \n\n&gt; $hit - you gotta be effing with me man. \n\n&gt; $infosec - yeah but its not that bad as you are locked here. If you click on anything it will return an invalid user and lock you out. \n\n&gt; $CIO - Ah ok so its just a hole to plug not a major breach?\n\n&gt; $infosec - Well not exactly see...\n\nFrom there he shows us how he was able to spoof commands through chrome extensions to enable the disabled machine admin and enable RDP. \n\n&gt; $infosec - So now that we are in. I need to show you this. \n\nTurns out RDP had been enabled recently and from an IP address originating in an African country. It had been used to alter emails that were being sent out. \n\nFor those unaware of the gravity of this. In the mortgage industry, you will occasionally have to set up a CD for a wire transfer. You email the secure link to the borrower or the lender, and they xfer the money into the CD. \n\nIf you can change the text of the email, then you can change the destination of the secure link to a different CD. \n\nWe are talking about the potential to steal anywhere from 250k for a single family home to well over 5m for warehousing or wholesale lending. \n\nThe CIO had already ended the skype call and I was instructed to disable all accounts associated with that branch. We are talking all accounts associated with that branch. Email, AD, the accounts for all of our loan programs. All of it. \n\nAll of their emails were set up with an auto response that all employees at this branch were out of pocket for the next 48 hours as a technical problem was being solved. I told the two junior guys to go home and log into the phone system from their home setups. The senior tech on location was instructed to disabled all external access from that server and to escape out the back door. (No not kidding.) \n\nMy manager was on the phone with their branch manager immediately letting them know that their branch was shut down for the next 2 days as a security consultant was brought in to handle it. \n\nFrom then on I have been punching the clock until about 30 minutes ago, when the clock stuck midnight, from my home office setup as I got to tell hundreds of employees that they were unable to make money for the next few days. \n\nI have never gotten drunk off of scotch before. I may do that tonight.",

I got divorced (hence why I no longer sleep with The Geek), moved states, my law firm closed and because of that, I had to find a new job.\n\nI'm now at a new law firm, where the people are cool, my new boss is laid back, but the $ITManager is....  not so bright.\n\nWe're a multi-state firm, and I work in one of the satellite offices.  One of the things that I was warned about was that if the main office has tech issues, EVERY office will have tech issues.  There was once one time where, due to inclement weather at the main office for several days, our office had no internet/connectivity for the same amount of time.\n\nThere's no system for submitting trouble tickets whenever there's an IT issue, and it's all basically done through Email to the Office Manager (my $Boss) who then emails the $ITManager, who then doesn't do much until a wand is waved, magic happens and somehow the problem gets fixed.\n\nToday's problem was because a new attorney had been trying for days to hook up to the office wifi on his laptop, but was unable to do so, because his laptop just couldn't see the wifi signal.  $Boss had been emailing $ITManager asking for help continually, and kept getting the same response back:\n\n&gt;  I'm not sure what the problem is, I connected the cord to the device, it should work.  It must be something with $Attorney's laptop.\n\n$Boss was getting frustrated, and I happened to walk into her office right at one of those moments.\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  Wassup?\n\n&gt;  **$Boss**:  WHAT GODDAMN DEVICE?  WHAT CORD???  GODDAMNIT!!!!!!\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  Wha....? \n\n&gt;  **$Boss**:  $Attorney has been trying for 4 days to hook up to the Wifi, and he can't, and I can't get a decent answer as to why not?\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  Well... I'm not an IT person, but I used to sleep with one, want me to look at it?  Where's the router?\n\n&gt;  **$Boss**:  You want to give it a shot?\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  Sure... everyone knows how to hook up a wireless router...\n\n$Boss walks me into the conference room and points to under the table, there I see a blue ethernet cable poking out from the table.  I crawl under, see that the ethernet cable is stapled to the top of the table, and then goes down one of the legs.  I follow it down, and lo! and behold!  there is the router.  \n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  That's too bad.  This should be red...\n\n&gt;  **$Boss**:  Why?\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  [Because the red ones go fastah...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/30tw8v/never_send_a_user_to_do_a_techs_work/cpvsxe7/)\n\n&gt;  **$Boss**:  Are you pulling my leg?\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  Of course...!\n\nI then had $Boss go run and grab my phone from my desk, so I could see if I could \"see\" the wifi signal with that.  While she did that, I double checked to make sure the router was plugged in (it wasn't) and that there was another ethernet cable going out of the router and into a modem (there wasn't an actual modem, but there was a jack in the floor with two ethernet plugs).\n\n$Boss came back with my phone and I went to my Wifi settings.\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  What's the name of the signal?  Please tell me it's something easy like LawFirm123 &amp; LawFirm123Guest.\n\n&gt;  **$Boss**:  No, it's &lt;random set of numbers that I'll never remember, again&gt; &amp; &lt;same random set of number_Guest&gt;.\n\nWhelp, that's not showing up, I double check the lights are on with the router (they are) and then decide to take the white ethernet cable from one jack and put it in the other.\n\n**BEWM**\n\nThere's the wifi.\n\n&gt;  **$Me**:  Okee doke, there it is, let's go get $Attorney connected.\n\nWe walk to $Attorney's office, I pull up his network settings and **VOILA!** there's the wifi.  $Boss reminds him of the password and he's logged on.\n\nI may still be bitter about the divorce, but listening to the Ex tell me about his day has taught me how to trouble shoot and fix simple things. \n\n:) ",

We used Lotus Notes as our mail client and every office had a user/mail group set up so that mass emails could be sent out to everyone within a single group or office. It looked something like *$Office/All*. However, there was also group called *$Company/All*, containing every single employee within the company. See where this is going?\n\nOne day someone accidentally sends an email to *$Company/All* which is obviously meant to be for a specific person. Unfortunately, some of the recipients did not understand the concept of mailing lists and decided to send a reply and ask if the email was really meant for them. And instead of just hitting \"Reply\", they hit \"Reply All\".\n\nAbout twice a minute, another confused reply is sent out to 4000 employees. People start sending out mass emails, begging their fellow coworkers to stop hitting \"reply all\" to no avail. Someone's secretary even responded to one of these pleas and promised to \"look into the request\" before sending her reply to all, obviously not having read the actual message or caught up with events.\n\nFortunately, none of this fell within my responsibilities, so my coworker and I simply couldn't help but sit back and laugh as the servers burned.\n\n**TL;DR:** Someone accidentally sends out an email to 4000 people. Too many decide to reply to all and ask why they received said email.",

        "text": "Greetings, friends.  \n  \nI had myself a giggle the other day and, while small, wanted to share.  \n  \n*Background: I am one of two IT personnel for a fairly sizable company with multiple properties and hundreds of employees in the casino/hotel industry. Given that technology plays a huge role in casino gaming and a variety of the other vital functions in our industry, much of our supervisory staff are pretty computer literate. Much of the staff. Not all.*  \n  \nWith the New Year occurring, there were lots of things that we had going on including new technologies and gaming promotions going live, maintenance agreements and contract services to renew, and a whole host of technical adjustments going on. Amid all of these things, we get a frantic telephone call from the $PitSuper in one of our casinos. My director will be $admin. The conversation was something to the effect of:      \n  \n&gt; $PitSuper: $admin, can you put the programs on the computer??? It's the new year and we need them!  \n  \n&gt; $admin: Why are they gone? Aren't they the same programs that are always on there?  \n  \n&gt; $PitSuper: Yes, but you have to change them every year so we can use them for the new year and we don't lose last year's info!  \n  \n&gt;  $admin: Uhhh...okay! Let me remote control your computer and I will take a look for you.  \n  \n*He connects to the Pit's computer*  \n  \n&gt; $PitSuper: See! There they are! But they all say 2017! Can you fix that?\"  \n  \nQue banging heads against desks. You may have guessed it. The \"programs\" we had to put on their computer were actually revenue and player information tracking spreadsheets--three different reports with a workbook for each, and each workbook has a worksheet for each month. Each year has its own set (fairly reasonable). They just needed the shortcuts to the 2018 spreadsheets from their department's share on the file server. Any adequate person would check the existing shortcuts' file paths and navigated to the path. Checked several levels around for the 2018 files. Nope. They didn't exist.  \n  \n&gt; $admin: So it looks like you don't have the 2018 report templates. Those will need to be created before I can do this.  \n  \n&gt; $PitSuper: Can't you do that?  \n  \n&gt; $admin: No, that is something the $PitSuperPositionTitle does, since it's the Pit spreadsheets and we don't know how all your numbers work. You might check with your department manager or the accounting department.  \n  \nSo, **TL;DR**... Excel spreadsheets are \"programs\" and some departments apparently expect IT to perform accounting functions. Fun. \n  \nNow it's back to a variety of current issues.\n  \nHere's to a great rest of the day! Cheers.  \n  \n[EDIT: Story has been altered and obfuscated to protect the names of the innocent and make it less recognizable. The gist of it remains the same.]",

I ask her to tell me what it's doing, and she isn't sure, so I decide to walk over and check it out.\n\nThe error says \"Unable to connect to service.  Please contact your systems administrator.\"\n\nHer machine is a little over 5 years old, so it has weird issues from time to time.  I tell her to restart her computer and see if that fixes the issue.  80% of the time this works.\n\nI watch her go to restart, this is her process:\n\n1. Slowly move mouse to start menu (she's always nervous when I'm watching) and click start\n2. press Crtl+Alt+Del\n3. click the power button there\n\nI don't know what magic she thought she was doing by clicking the start menu before doing what she did, or how she learned that her roundabout Ctrl+Alt+Del method of restarting was the right way to go, but I showed her the much more efficient way to restart of Start &gt; Restart this morning.\n\nI can guarantee the next time I help her fix something there will be some new mind blowing way of doing things.

        "text": "This story happened a few years ago and it's about how I managed to endure only 2 weeks of an awful job.\n\nAs some of you probably know, I'm not officially tech support... but in this particular story I was! Originally I was hired to do interviews and profile evaluations of possible candidates. But when I arrived to this company I couldn't help but notice one thing: every system in the building was wrong in a way, most computers were slow af, and covered in cigar Ash; no network at all despite that being the main purpose of the computers (and the reason why they kept the original IT guy!) not even the printers or internet worked! So I decided to gave it a look, I knew it would make my work easier. Long story short: the IT guy didn't even knew how to use newer versions of windows and was just cashing his checks and giving the company \"computer gibberish that no one understood\" to get off the hook, so it became my job to fix everything, which I did, thankfully. \n\nNow that I had a functional system I created a python script that automatically created and printed that week payroll (they were doing it by hand!!!), went to be a 3 day job to 15 minutes tops.\n\nAnd that was just week one, everyone was happy but no one wanted to pay me a rise, never mind two salaries for the two jobs I was doing, not even a little bonus.\n\nThe next week I was warned that we would be getting a large transfer worth this company and other 2 smaller companies  monthly payroll for us to administer and the first thing we needed to do was transfer it again to another account and pay everyone for that week. \n\nThe last day available for transfers, two hours before deadline (because you know.. Efficiency and good planning) I saw everyone panicking, smoking and drinking (yes, as in beer). The bank wouldn't accept the transfer, there was no error message and it was to late to contact the bank. Of course the boss was worried he might go to jail for this mistake and maybe the company would be terminated. They forced everyone to stay past our normal work hours just to watch. \n\nOne hour left to do the transfer. \n\nThat was it, I was tired of that company. I went to the office where they did the transfers and instantly noticed the system was old and the bank system was older! It only accepted movements like that in excel 2003 files, they were trying to enter a 2007 file. Corrected it, tried again, no dice.\n\nI convinced my boss that I had to see the excel sheet, maybe it was an error in the file itself. I noticed that someone captured  the data by hand and there were tons of mistakes, but mainly special characters. I quickly created a search and replace function to remove special characters, tried again and it worked! \n\n&gt;boss: well we solved the problem, everyone is free to go, thank you\n\nWhat? We did? Not even a small recognition? A bonus for saving your ass? Not even the money for transport so late at night? \n\n&gt;me: you know what? I quit\n\n&gt;boss: ok whatever, here is your two week check\n\nI left the company just to be called the next week to be informed that the persons who took my spot couldn't handle it and they wanted to hire me as a consultant with less pay of course. Nope, nope, nope. \n\n\nThe company went bankrupt 2 months after that... Who could have foreseen that? ",

        "text": "*Previously, on TFTS….*\n\n*I [had been paid a visit by the Good Idea Fairy](https://redd.it/7ngnh9) who inspired me to hold onto a set of stairs while riding on the back of a golf cart.  While what I’d done was moronic, the person whom I was assisting had the brilliant idea of cutting under the aircraft that was shorter than the stand is.  Aircraft damage ensued, and it said person, Horsehead ($HH) had first tried to get me to walk away, then lie about his involvement, and then lie about what happened.  Soon, it was also discovered the structural repair manual was invalidated by a modification the aircraft had received and required assistance from $AircraftManufacturer.  $HH and I were drug tested and then sent home until further notice….*\n\n*One thing I’d forgotten…$HH had pointed out that I wanted to keep quiet because I was a mechanic at the beginning of my career, and it would be a shame to have it end so quickly.  I’d taken it as misplaced advice, but I would eventually learn it was actually a warning…*\n***\n\n&gt;**$UpperManager** “Truth is paramount.  Always be honest.  Live honestly and with integrity in everything you do.”\n\n$UpperManager set down $AviationCompany’s moral standards guide and glared at me.  \n\n&gt;**$UpperManager**  “Tell me again what happened.”\n\nIt had been several days since the incident.  The $Artist had fixed the plane, since he knew even without engineering direction just what would be required, however the release had been delayed due to having to wait for $AircraftManufacturer’s response and appropriate engineering documentation (which matched $Artist's repair exactly...there's a reason I call him $Artist.  Hell, I think he *tells* our engineers exactly what to put into the repairs often enough...)  I, meanwhile, had driven home in a small blizzard and had been playing far too much Kerbal Space Program/painting Warmachine while nearly climbing the walls out of suspense.  The call to come in to be interviewed by $UpperManager and $WeekendManager was a welcome change to the wait—at last, either they’d take my badge and walk me and my toolbox out, or I’d be left on ice for a few more days before receiving an official Letter of Reprimand in my file.  \n\nFinally getting that interview was still intimidating—I fully expected to get an Army-style gluteal reduction discussion—but it was remarkably civil.  I was able to walk both managers through the events, they asked me the obvious questions about safety and common sense, and I felt appropriately contrite/embarrassed that I’d fallen for the Good Idea Fairy’s spell.  When it was over, I was told to head on home and they’d let me know their decision by the end of the week.\n\nNotably, my badge was still in my possession when I left.   \n\n***\n\nI was at my local game store when the call from $DutyManager, my direct boss, came in.  He told me I should come back to work the following week, that I would be receiving a letter in my file with an 18-month shelf life (the norm was only 6!) and I’d better watch my step—the only reason I’d kept my job was because I came forward and was honest.  \n\nI returned to work for a week (in which another damage occurred, I was involved from the angle that the person who did the damage didn’t listen to what I was asking and did the exact opposite…) and then shipped out to The Mothership for $OtherAircraftManufactuer Aircraft training for a month.  $HH, meanwhile, had been fired for his involvement and attempted cover-up, but was appealing the decision to the Employee Council.   We’re not union, but some things still operate like one.\n\n***\n\nPretty cut and dried, eh?  But if it were, we wouldn’t be reading a part II, I’d have just looped it into the original post.  \n\nA month and a half after the incident, I was called by $UpperManager and $WeekendManager to join them at The Mothership for a hearing before the Employee Council leaders regarding $HH’s job.  We were also joined by $Lead2, who had been in the office when $HH had asked me about the story.  I dutifully flew down to perform my key-witness/accomplice duties and found myself waiting in a tiny little break room outside a classroom in one of The Mothership’s hangars.   I, of course, dressed up into appropriate Business Interview attire for the event, as were my managers.  When I was called in to speak, however, I found a rather…different scene.\n\nAt the head of the classroom was a long table with six or seven Employee Council members seated facing the door.  On the left side of the room sat $HH, who was dressed as if he’d just been drug off a fishing boat—board shorts, boots, boonie cap and an untucked button-down fishing shirt.  To the right sat $UpperManager, who had quite the pained expression and $Lead2, who wore a canary-eating grin.  \n\n&gt;**$CouncilMember1**  “ZeeWulf, did you tell $HH that you were going to ride on the back of the golf cart?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Yes….we’d discussed the plan beforehand.  It wasn’t smart, but we’d both agreed to it.”\n\n&gt;**$CouncilMember1** “So $HH *was* aware that you were on the cart with the stand?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “….yeah?  Like I said, we’d talked about it….”\n\nA pit began to form in my stomach.  I had a feeling there’d been more lying.  Another $CouncilMember2 rifled through her notes.  \n\n&gt;**$CouncilMember2** “And how did you lose control of the stand and let it run into the plane when $HH took such a wide berth around it?”\n\nI blinked.  I glanced over at $HH, who was looking smug, and then at $UpperManager and $Lead2, fuming and grinning respectively.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Wide berth?  What?  No, no…”  *glancing at a whiteboard*  “Mind if I draw what actually happened?”\n\nI was given an affirmative and proceeded to draw and explain just how sharply $HH had cut us under the plane.  $HH stopped looking smug at that and instead started glaring at me as I danced away from the bus he’d just tried to run me over with.  \n\n&gt;**$CouncilLeader** “So, $HH was fully aware of you on the back of the cart, and did actually cut too close to the plane.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Yes, that’s what happened.”\n\n&gt;**$CouncilLeader**  “Thank you, you’re dismissed.  $Lead2, I do believe you have a statement you’d like to read….”\n\n***\n\nIt turns out that in his interviews and statements, $HH had declared he had no idea I was on the cart and that I’d lost control of the stand and let it drive into the plane, in spite of his Super Safe Driving Far Around The Plane.  And in spite of his lack of decorum, his obvious lies, the counter-testimony  from me, the witnessing of the lies in action by $Lead2, $HH was returned to work for ‘insufficient evidence of negligence.’  He also received back-pay for the time he was out ‘fired.’  On the bright side, they also charged him all his vacation and sick time.\n\nI, meanwhile, learned a couple of valuable lessons:\n\nAlways tell the truth, even when it sucks.  The short-term cost may be pretty steep, but the long term benefits and peace of mind are worth it.  \n\nWhen dealing with old union sycophants, whether or not there’s a union currently present, know that they’ll always stick together against the newer guy and therefore always cross your T’s, dot your I’s and be prepared.  \n\n\n***\n\nEDIT: One last note-It came out quickly how hard $HH tried to throw me under that bus, and my entire crew stuck up for me.  In fact, it's gotten around a fair bit that he's not to be trusted so the only people at this point who associate with him is his immediate crewmates who've worked with him for the past twenty years already.\n\n***\n\n*All the stories, [Chronologically](https://redd.it/7i0esb)*",

Sounds easy enough to begin with, but then it gets interesting. The user said they were able to insert the USB memory stick in to the PC, but there was nowhere to insert the floppy disk.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***WAIT WHAT?***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDo a quick check to make sure that it is indeed 2018 and that suddenly floppy disk is not cutting edge technology.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a few stunned moments of silence we make sure they definitely mean floppy disk and not CD (it has happened before). Yep, they are definitely floppy disks, so we explain to the user that floppy disks are redundant and have been for a very long time. If they want to transfer the data from floppy disk to USB they are going to have to order a 3.5\" floppy disk drive that plugs in via USB.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe then had to have a long discussion with the user as to why floppy disk drives are no longer standard on all PCs. Especially micro form factor PCs. During the discussion we found out that the floppy disks were storing data from a project that took place back in 1995 to 1998 and had been in storage ever since.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo idea what the project was, or even why they need to reference the data 20 years later, but I hope they get their data off those disks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTLDR: I'm sorry, are you calling from the past?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

This happened a few years ago.\n\nWhen I built my first PC, I gathered a lot of knowledge of PC hardware. This led to some of my friends asking me to compile build lists for them, which I also did entirely for free. One of the build lists I compiled was for a friend of a friend, a guy a couple of years younger than me, and included for example a GTX 760, i5 4670K and 8 GB ram. A pretty decent gaming PC at the time. However, while I compiled the build lists, I never built any of these PCs I picked parts for. This is important.\n\nA while later, this friend of a friend contacts me via proxy and complains that his PC is slow. Not only is the in-game performance in games like CS:GO and Simcity beyond mediocre, but also the desktop performance with Windows Aero active. \n\nI start by doing some tests to see if the games are somehow bottlenecked by the CPU or if the memory is full. Nope, nothing abnormal there. I do however have problems finding the graphics card in the device manager for some reason. Looking into the case side panel window, both PCIe power cables are plugged in. Since video is being output, I assume that the graphics card is working, although something must be horribly wrong with it. Unless...\n\nLooking towards the IO panel, I see that the two monitors are plugged into the motherboard video ports instead of the graphics card. The reason for that was that those ports worked, according to the owner, but he wasn't aware that he was using the integrated graphics. Looking into the case again, onto the underside of the graphics card. None of its fans are spinning. DoA? Unless something inside the case might provide the answer.\n\nOpening the case, I find that the graphics card is wired up using Molex-to-PCIe adapters. Yes, that's right. For this build, I chose a Corsair PSU that came with several PCIe power cables, and the person who built it chose to use Molex-to-PCIe for no good reason at all. It should have worked in theory, but it didn't. Swapped those out for the PCIe cables from the power supply.\n\nDid you guess what happened? The graphics card suddenly worked, and all of his performance issues were gone. He did pay me for it, even though I didn't ask for it. Oh well.\n\n**Edit:** I found in the old conversation with my friend that my friend's friend thought he needed 16 GBs of ram, and the reason it lagged was due to the fact that he had only 8.",

        "text": "\n# Background\n\nHi TFTS, LTL. FTP.\n\nI work at a company that provides CRM software for pharmaceutical companies. We provide support for both the software and hardware, depending on the client's preferences and resources. This story is from when I was still fairly new-ish and is one of the clients for which we provide hardware support.\n\n# Our cast\n\n$me - Me (duh!)\n\n$user - Our luser of the day\n\n# On with the show!\n\n\nIt was a fairly normal day, not terribly busy, but not slow enough that you'd fall asleep at your desk. We were doing an upgrade to our CRM software for this client, and as per custom we need to reach out to at least two users to verify the upgrade went through successfully. In pops an e-mail from my $supervisor telling me which of the users I have to reach out to:\n\n-------\n\n*To: $me*\n\n*Cc: $AM (account manager), $helpdesk*\n\n*Telume,*\n\n*Please contact the $user to confirm that she is able to pick up the upgrade.*\n\n-------\n\nI had thought to myself that it was fairly simple, usually when we run into issues it's something the user is doing. If not, we do our best to resolve it, and if all else fails, open a ticket with QA or Development to have the issue investigated.\n\nThankfully, she had downloaded the upgrade with no issues. So, my call went something like this:\n\n&gt;$me: Hello, this is Telume from the $helpdesk. Is this $user?\n\n&gt;$user: Yes, this is $user.\n\n&gt;$me: Hi, I'm calling about the upgrade to $CRMapp, do you have a moment? We just want to verify your upgrade to $version of &gt;$CRMapp.\n\n&gt;$user: Sure. Do you need me to do anything?\n\nI helpfully guide the user through the app and verify the items that are in the e-mail and it isn't until we get to Geolocation that we run into issues. She's able to access Geolocation, but upon trying to do anything she's immediately kicked back out to the main screen of our application.\n\nNow, in most cases people ignore Geolocation completely, but it is VERY useful to have. Basically, it's a fancy map that not only tells you how to get to an office, but it can also tell you the quickest routes to get through your calls for the day. For some people this is basically the best thing since sliced bread, especially if your calls require you to cover a lot of ground. I've talked to people that have to go to offices in two to three different states, with some distances well over ~400 miles easily.\n\nShe's on a $fruitTablet, so it's pretty easy to troubleshoot.\n- Reboot? Nope, doesn't do anything.\n\n- Reset Network on tablet? Nope.\n\n- Location on? Yup\n\n- Make sure user's on Wi-Fi or cellular data? Yup.\n\nAfter having mentioned that she doesn't understand why I'm checking Geolocation, since she doesn't use it. I'm at a complete loss, but then the user mentions something that tips me off:\n\n&gt;$me: I understand you don't use Geolocation, but there are other people who may use it. So, if you're having an issue, then it could be affecting everyone. If we can't resolve it, we'll have to escalate to see what the problem could be.\n\n&gt;$user: Does the $fruitTabletOS version matter? I'm on version $atLeastThreeYearsOldByThisPoint.\n\n&gt;$me: Um, yes, the recommended version is $recommendedVersion.\n\n&gt;$user: Oh, I don't upgrade because I'm scared of breaking things, everything's worked perfectly so far. You know what, don't even worry about it, I don't even use Geolocation.\n\n&gt;$me: Ah, I see. The latest recommended version is $recommendedVersion. Lets try upgrading to see if that will resolve the issue. You will need to be on Wi-Fi and connected to a power outlet.\n\n&gt;$user: Well, I'm out doing my usual runs, can I upgrade later?\n\n&gt;$me: Of course, you can upgrade at your convenience by connecting to Wi-Fi at your home and starting the upgrade. Once you kick off, you can't stop it.\n\n&gt;$user: Okay, well I don't have Wi-Fi at my house. I'll need to do it from like a Starbucks or something.\n\nAt this point, I didn't really think anything of it, but I still found it strange that someone didn't have Wi-Fi at their house.\n\n&gt;$me: Okay, do that and I can call you back tomorrow to confirm everything is resolved. Call us back if you need assistance with the upgrade.\n\n&gt;$user: Okay, I'll let you know. Thanks! *click*\n\nWe ended the call and I was feeling fairly confident that she would at least do her due dilligence. \n\nOf course, this is a TFTS story and so we move on to the next day when I called her back. It was somewhat close to quitting time (~30-45 minutes), so I figured I'd check in with her to see how things were going.\n\n&gt;$me: Hi $user, this is Telume with $helpdesk how are you doing today?\n\n&gt;$user: Hi, how are you doing *(she recognized my voice)*?\n\n&gt;$me: Doing great, just calling in to check up on the status of that upgrade for $fruitTabletOS you said you were going to do?\n\n&gt;$user: Oh, yeah, I didn't do it.\n\n&gt;$me: Didn't have a chance, or....?\n\n&gt;$user: No, I just didn't do it. Everything is working wonderfully, so I just figured I wouldn't do it! *oddly proud of this*\n\n&gt;$me: *eyetwitch* Well, okay, but I believe we agreed to do the upgrade yesterday to see if it resolves your issue.\n\n&gt;$user: Yes, but I'm perfectly fine and I don't use Geolocation anyway, so I don't want to upgrade.\n\n&gt;$me: ... But we want to make sure that the issue has to do with the $fruitTabletOS version and not with the application.\n\nAt this point, the user could A. Listen to Reason or B. Try to weasel her way out of it by flipping out at me. Guess which option she chose.\n\n&gt;$user: Why do I have to upgrade?! It just ends up breaking stuff! I don't even have Wi-Fi at my house!\n\n&gt;$me: *Try to explain issue with patches, security, performance, etc., but user is having none of it.*\n\n&gt;$user: *proceed to repeat what she just said above* I don't know why you guys want me to upgrade! Everything is working beautifully and you guys are awesome every time I call in, but I will decline. At this point I don't need your assistance any further. Thank you and have a wonderful day. Bye! *click*\n\nI was pretty much speechless at this point. I put my notes in the ticket and let my supervisor know what was going on. After that, I fired off an e-mail to $AM to let him know, and closed the ticket. He was as incredulous as I was, but what can you do? Can't force people, right?\n\n# Epilogue\n\nShe actually ended up calling back a month later and I helped her out (again!). She recognized my voice and apologized profusely stating that she was under a lot of stress and blah blah blah. She also confirmed that her boss actually called her and forced her to upgrade, which  (surprise!) resolved the issue.",

        "text": "Hi again TFTS! This was really just too good NOT to share with y'all.     \n    \nI am the IT Mangler for a life science company. We have sales folks scattered all over the US and abroad and it is my department that handles their tech needs. Generally speaking, our sales people are *smart* - science-ey smart though, not \"every day\" smart or even \"common sense\" smart so I was really only surprised this has not happened before now.     \n    \nKey players:    \n$Me - well, me       \n$Maria - the head of all things to do with sales in my company; a fiery tiny Latin woman with an adorable accent and a wrath greater than Khan could dream of     \n$SP - Newish remote sales person who isn't exactly performing the way Maria expects; very southern lady who sounds like a valley girl and says \"right\" way too often       \n$HR - My HR Director, who started me off on this journey with a phone call     \n     \nMy phone rang a bit after 11AM yesterday and it was $HR calling to ask if I would look and see why $SP \"couldn't log in to her computer\" and why $SP's company issued cellphone has been \"cut off\" -  this was what $HR was told - NOT the version I got from $SP.    \n\n\"That's really strange\" I thought as I hung up the call - how could $SP's phone and login BOTH get messed up, especially with $SP on vacation the last 2 weeks?    \n   \n\nI should note that we have a system that emails you every day for 14 days before your AD password expires. That way there are no surprises when it is time to change it. It's a bit of a different process with a remote user but all of that info is given to them (and shown - we have actual *hands-on training with the IT Dept* for the remote folks to ensure they know how their tech works before they leave after they are onboarded and sent home to sell) up front. And I am also responsible for all the cell phones so I KNEW her cell was NOT cut off (I even checked!)...  \n  \nI hung up with $HR and called $SP on her personal number &amp; it went something like this:    \n    \n\n&gt;$Me: Hi $SP, $HR just called me and said you have some IT problems with your laptop and cell phone?    \n  \n&gt;$SP: Yeah, right, uh I can't get into my laptop and I haven't been getting email on my phone &amp; I thought I was fired, right, so I wiped my phone and now all I can do is make calls and text, I lost my email, I just got back from sailing around the Bahamas with my husband and I can't work like this, right! (all this came out as one sentence by the way, she was pretty freaked out)       \n    \n&gt;$Me: You thought you were fired because you couldn't log into your laptop so you wiped your phone?    \n   \n&gt;$SP: I just like talked to $HR &amp; I realized, right, that this was probably my own fault, right?    \n    \n&gt;$Me: Well, one thing at a time - did you say you wiped your phone? Does it still *work*? $HR said it didn't work &amp; was cut off.    \n    \n&gt;$SP: I didn't WIPE it, right, I just took my Apple ID off and reset it.   \n   \n&gt;$Me: ...   \n   \nI led $SP through a long and winding path to get her password reset (completely blind - usually I can use some kind of tool but not this time, had to lead her through it from memory) and sent instructions on how to get her email back on her phone.    \n    \n$HR kept calling me in the middle of this call to find out what happened &amp; once I got off the phone with $SP I called her and explained the situation as far as what ACTUALLY happened since $HR was basically told it was a complete IT issue &amp; $SP blamed MY DEPARTMENT for her not being able to work. Apparently she hung up with me and called $Maria...    \n     \n    \n5 minutes later my cell phone rings and it is $Maria. My cell signal sucks in the building I was in so I had to text her that I would call her back, and I did.     \n\n   \n&gt;$Maria: What the fook is going on with $SP?? She has not been doing sheet and eet ees impossible to get her to veesit coostomers! What happened today?!???    \n   \n&gt;$Me (explaining the gist of it, really): She thought she had been fired because she couldn't get into her laptop and she was not getting any new emails on her phone. So she wiped the phone to send it back. I then explained the password expiration and what steps had been taken by me to get $SP back online.          \n   \n&gt;$Maria: Joo have got to be fooking keeding me! She thought she was FIRED?!? What the FOOK? I am remote, thees ees day one stuff!!!!! Eet ees not hard!! Shee ees an eedeeot!!!!    (I can translate that if need be)       \n   \n$Maria called me back *6* times after that call just to have me go back over *everything* and basically said $SP now has one last chance  because quotas are not being met and she wasted a good bit of MY time over a non-issue that, had she READ the email she did have on her phone, she would have KNOWN TO CHANGE HER PASSWORD &amp; this tale wouldn't exist. She said other things as well, most of them Spanglish curse words but I know she meant it &amp; I am damn happy I am not $SP.     \n   \nSo, $SP is back online now and right in $Maria's line of sights. I have a feeling the next time $HR calls me about $SP it will be to tell me $SP is for real being fired &amp; to cut off her accounts and cell.    \nI give $SP 6 months.    \n\n    \nTL/DR: Salesperson thought they were fired because their password expired while they were on vacation &amp; flipped out causing their manager to flip out as well.\n   \n   \nEdit(s): Words, clarity &amp; formatting\n   \n**Final Edit: Guess whose account I just disabled and phone I cut off? 6 months was apparently way too generous on my part, $Maria does not mess around! I am putting together a $Maria \"best of\" for those who appreciate her on here and will post that soon!\n**",

Once was a two-man startup, the other (for which I was the technical lead) was owned by a company with substantial local financial backing.\n\nTo compete with those guys, we offered free installation support, including free house calls if you couldn't get it to work. This was the days of Windows 3.11 and, after we opened up, Windows 95, so it wasn't a straightforward thing to get on the internet for people who were new to computers.\n\nOne customer surprised me by calling, though, because I knew her husband formerly owned an IBM and Compaq PC dealership (because my first IT job was working for him) and should have been able to navigate through this. She called and said she couldn't follow the written instructions, so I attempted to guide her through the process.\n\nIt rapidly became apparent that she was right-clicking when I said left-click and left-clicking when I said right-click. I eventually bit the bullet and told her that it sounded like this was what was happening, and she said \"I know my right from my left, I have a college degree.\"\n\nI didn't want to lose a customer to an argument, so I told her I'd come right out and help myself. When I got there, the husband was sitting in the same living room the PC was in, reading the newspaper, making a show of not helping her.\n\nI asked her to left-click on the menu and hold the button down, and sure enough, she right-clicked on it. I said \"that's the right button, the left button is the other one.\"\n\nHer husband started chuckling, and she looked up at me red-faced and said \"I majored in flute.\"\n",

        "text": "Sweden has a nationwide terrestrial broadcasting grid for TV channels and radio. The TV broadcasts has been purely digital since 2007, and the digital channels were broadcasted in parallel for about a decade before the analog signals were finally phased out.\n\nThis story begins in the middle of 2007, when we in my family finally accepted that fact that we had to force my granddad to get a set top box.\n\nI bought one that I had from previous experience kind of appreciated as having no unnecessary extra features, and that was capable of producing error messages on the screen in Swedish, since gramps didn't exactly see the need to learn english just for the sake of the STB, going steady on 90 years old.\n\nIt did have one feature though that was unavoidable: it was ANOTHER REMOTE. The horror. The annoyance. The whining. The...you know, the hardships elderly sometimes have adapting to new technology.\n\nIt took him quite some time to figure out that there were some buttons on the remote to the tv that was used for some things, and that the tiny, new remote was to be used for all the rest. When I say \"quite some time\" I actually mean that it took probably a hundred phone calls and at least 20 house calls to increase his confidence level to the point where he had it barely figured out.\n\nOnce he was confident, though, that's when the problems started.\n\nAt fist, it kind of came sneaking up on me. Eventually, it was my standard evening pastime, talking about how to press a specific button \"yes, the one on the third row. it has s symbol that looks like an arrow and a ring, kind of thing. Yes. I'll wait while you fetch the magnifying class. No. No. Not the pink one. This one should be black! Oh, it only looked pink because you spilled something on it? Good. Press that button.\" until he could get the news on.\n\nRapport, the SVT news program, has been broadcasted since *1969*. It has been aired at 19.30 for as long as I can remember. Which means that if the phone rang at 19.20-ish, I already knew who was calling.\n\nAfter going through the frustrations with teaching how the remote worked (yes, we wrote actual instructions. in Times New Roman 20pt, for easier readability) the calls eventually evolved into something more...peculiar. That is what the story is actually about.\n\nNo matter how he tried, he failed to change tv channel at will. Sometimes other grand children came by, watched something and left the box set on another channel. And it was 100% certain that he was unable to change channel again.\n\nIt went to the point where he concluded that \"with this new digital stuff, you can't switch channel if you don't try to do it between the shows.\" For those of you who know how DVB works, you know that this is simply not true. So when he suggested that, I knew something had to be done.\n\nI habitually went to his place in the evening, just to ensure that the damn box wasn't playing tricks on him. I even tried the remote extensively to the point where I had to replace the batteries (so, LOTS of keypresses) and came up empty-handed.\n\nAnd then it struck me. This *has* to be a user error. I kind of suspected all along, but I was unable to prove it.\n\nEventually I told him to show me how he did it himself.\n\nThen I figured it out.\n\nGranddad had been a farmer all his life. Taller than most doors, wider than some doors. He worked with his hands all of his life. Up until his body started to complain. One of the things that started to give up was his hands. He was still ridiculous strong in his hands, but as it often happens with elderly, he had trouble properly closing his hands around objects. If you had a desk clerk job, that is probably not much of a problem, because your hands are reasonably sized. Gramps hands were about the size of small dinner plate.\n\nHolding on to a tiny remote was really, really tricky for him. He was, barely, able to grip it between thumb and middle finger. And when he pressed a button (that took the other hand, of course) the remote almost slipped out of his hand. So...obviously, he placed his index finger in front of the remote, to keep it in his hand.\n\nAnyone who has ever seen a remote knows that you should not hold a finger in front of it. Or so I thought.\n\nYou know those universal remotes that are large as a netbook? With 1/2\" square buttons and very large printed numbers? I got him one of those. He LOVED it.",

        "text": "As I mentioned in a prior post, I work in Healthcare IT for a small hospital. \n\n\nMy first task on the dawning of Jan 2, 2018 was maddening. For some reason, our overhead paging system would repeatedly chime, as if someone were about to be paged, and then hang up on itself. \n\n\nDing.\n\n\nOver. And Over. And Over.\n\n\nDing.\n\n\nDing.\n\n\n*Ding*.\n\n\nOur hospital's paging system works via internal phone line. A quick test of our paging system (Ext. 7800, lets say) revealed that it WAS working as intended. Dialed the extension, entered the paging command, which is 0, and paged someone without a problem. After I hung up, it started back up.\n\n\nDing.\n\n\n*Ding.* \n\n\n*DING*.\n\n\nThe hell.\n\n\nFirst thought- some user has mistakenly used one of our automated fax lines, designed to fax patient information to busy doctor's office fax machines, to somehow accidentally fax that particular extension. So I ran through the entire list of all of our automated fax lines to see if any of them were doing that. I came up empty.\n\n\nDing.\n\n\n*Ding*.\n\n\n*DING*\n\n\nDammit.\n\n\nSo I go to the MDF and look at the paging system, give it a power cycle.\n\n\n*DING*\n\n\nOk. So it's been an hour and I'm going a little crazy. I go and grab an old analog phone and unplug the RJ-11 that serves as the input of the paging system, and plug it into the analog phone, in the hopes that the caller ID might show me where the problem is coming from. \n\n\nSomething totally unexpected happened. The phone rang, and the caller ID was... a local residential number. \n\n\nI picked up.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Uhhh... Local Hospital, Can I help you?\n\n&gt;$Person: Yes! I have been calling all morning trying to cancel my appointment!\n\n&gt;$Me: Oh, I see. Well I am the IT Guy, but I'll transfer you to the switchboard to get you all fixed up.\n\n&gt;$Person: Thank you!\n\n\nSo I do the transfer and hang up. approximately 15 seconds go by and it rings again. The SAME RESIDENTIAL number pops up.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Hello again, this is the IT Guy. \n\n&gt;$Person: What in the hell is going on?\n\n&gt;$Me: Well, it looks like there's a problem with the phone line. Can you tell me what number you were calling?\n\n&gt;$Person: Yeah, it was 555-1234\n\n&gt;$Me: Okay. If you can give me five minutes, I think I can get you all fixed up, okay? \n\n&gt;$Person: Okay.\n\n\n555-1234 (Not the real number, obviously) just happened to be one of the phone numbers for our outpatient clinic in one of the other buildings. But why was it ringing here? \n\n\nSuddenly it hit me in a moment of clarity and fear.\n\n\nI unplug the analog phone, and plug the intercom system back in.\n\n\nI pick up my cell and call 555-1234.\n\n\nIt rings for a split second. \n\n\nI hear the momentary, telltale click of the CUCM call forward. \n\n\nThen I hear it connect to the paging system.\n\n\n**DING.**\n\n\nHoly crap. *The $receptionist at 555-1234 has forwarded their office phone* **TO THE INTERCOM.**\n\n\nI entered the paging command.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Will $Receptionist please call my extension at 9000?\n\n\nIn a moment, my Cisco 7925 rang. \n\n\n&gt;$Receptionist: Yes?\n\n&gt;$Me: Hey, is your office phone forwarded to anything?\n\n&gt;$Receptionist: Yeah, my voicemail, why?\n\n&gt;$Me: Could you doublecheck that for me please? I think you maybe put in the wrong number.\n\n&gt;$Receptionist: Okay.\n\n\nSo as it turns out, instead of forwarding to voicemail at ext. 7000, she forwarded to the intercom at ext. 7800... the two extensions have literally one digit difference, and those digits are right next to each other on the keypad.\n\n\nPatients have been dinging the intercom all morning.\n\n\nEven better, if they had dialed 0, they would have been speaking to EVERYONE IN THE HOSPITAL ALL AT ONCE. Which, admittedly, would have been HILARIOUS, but someone would have gotten in deep doodoo for that probably.\n\n\nAnyway, problem solved, until next time.\n\n\n**TL,DR: Hospital Patients called our overhead intercom system all morning because of user error.**\n\n",

Now I am a tech support for an entire state's court system, and am not able to physically be at a location. So I do the normal ask the caller to make sure the monitor is on, plugged in correctly, and remote onto computer to check the display settings. However, I couldn't remote onto the computer, so I asked her to restart it and the following dialogue occurred. \n\nMe: \"Okay, go ahead and restart the computer, and once it's back on let me know so I can remote on.\"\n\nCustomer: \"Ok....\"\n\nCustomer: Continues to talk about monitor signal....\n\nMe: \"Yeah, you need to restart the computer itself, so I can diagnose the monitor issues...\"\n\nCustomer: \"I can unplug the cable...\"\n\nMe: \"Let's not do that because if it's the computer cable you could damage the computer.\"\n\nCustomer: \"So restart it?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, you'll need to restart it so I can figure out if there is anything wrong with the software side of the computer.\"\n\nCustomer: \"So how what do I do?\"\n\nMe: \"You'll hit the power button on the desktop, the power light will go off, and then you will turn it back on. I'll then be able to remote onto the computer.\"\n\nCustomer: \"The monitor still says 'no signal'\"\n\nMe: \"Did you turn off the computer or the monitor.......\"\n\nCustomer: \"The monitor.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, you'll still need to restart the computer.\"\n\nCustomer: \"I just unplugged the cable...\"\n\nMe \".... okay, well you just unplugged the computer probably. Next time we'll need to avoid that since it can cause damage to the computer. Next time just hit the power button on the tower...\"\n\nI finally got the computer back on, explained again why just unplugging the computer is not an advised way of turning off the computer, and she logged onto it. Once she was logged on, both of her monitors turned on. I seriously think the whole issue stemmed from the computer not actually being turned on. ",

The client who actually pays attention, follows instructions, doesn't argue much, takes advice... That rare breed. :) I was dealing with a customer who was also the tech for some business or another, and they were experiencing service loss. Was one of those freak accident kinda situations, namely a car accident if memory serves. Nothing serious, just enough to wipe out utilities to one building.\n\nAnyways, this guy I'm talking to wants to know how long things are going to take, and lets me know that they're XYZ important business, and can't afford any downtime. Now, this particular flavour of commentary always gets on my nerves. If a business can't have any downtime, then a single point of failure is unacceptable. In this case, an internet connection to a single ISP isn't going to do it if they need next to 100% uptime. So I do what I usually do when this particular complaint pops up, and let the guy know he really needs to consider some sort of redundant connection. Lo and behold, the fellow actually said redundancy sounded like a good idea! And even more to my surprise, he asked for advice. I suggested working with his tech team to select one or more backup connections for them to work with, like another ISP and cellular data if need be. I also suggested looking into a router that could handle the failover, and made a few model suggestions.\n\nMy unicorn opted to take some time and write all my suggestions down, and do a little research of his own. I never heard from them again, but it was nice to have somebody that actually wanted a solution to a broader problem. Cherish your unicorns, folks!",

        "text": "Hey TFTS, back again, this time with a tale from a POS installation from the retail floor in which... well, you've read the title, you are probably getting an idea how this is going to go.\n\nIf you've never needed (or wanted) to give it much thought, physical space inside a retail store is a very important commoditiy. More space, more products. More products more sales. More sales, more money. So if you have something that does not, or can not make you money, it takes up as little space as possible. This is the front counter: small machines, minimalistic features, and a pain in the $$a to mess around with, especially if the store is open.\n\nSo cutting the story short here, I was installing the new setup before open, and hanging around for the day to iron out the wrinkles that come from the transition. The installation was relatively painless, everything was preconfigured and just had to be hooked up. That required bending my elbow at unnatural angles to feed cables, crawling around on the ground, and removing drawers to reach access points. It was behind one of these drawers that begins our tale proper.\n\nIn the long-forgotten recess behind the drawer, a large collection of crap had formed. Layers upon layers of dust, ancient faded receipts, lost pens, and most curiously, an old wireless mouse. Its batteries long since expired, and neither the new nor old hardware having a receiver, I had no issue with just popping it straight in the bin. I told the poor manager that got stuck arriving super early to open up for me what I'd found, just in case, and her face wrinkled up like I'd just farted.\n\n&gt;$PM \"Well what did you do with it?\"\n\n&gt;$ME \"I threw it out, did you want to keep it?\"\n\n&gt;$PM \"Ugh, no. I need to make some phone calls\"\n\nAnd with that she walked away, and I didn't give the encounter another thought. Everything else gets wired up, boots up, checks done, and I have enough time to quickly grab some liquified caffeine before the team training right before the store opens.\n\nIn what I consider to be the strangest part of this story, each of the new users was able to pick up all the core instructions for the new POS on the first attempts, and with the exception of one rogue CAPS LOCK press that threw us out for a minute, there were actually no user errors for the entire day.\n\n8.5 hours later, the store closes, and I do my final debrief with $PM. Everything goes smoothly until we're just about done when she throws in the curveball.\n\n&gt;$PM \"Oh, and I called the exterminators, they're going to have someone out here day after tomorrow.\"\n\n&gt;$ME \"I... what?\"\n\n&gt;$PM \"You said you found a dead mouse inside the cupboard, I want to make sure there aren't any more living in the store.\"\n\nI looked at her blankly for a second, before I calmly explained \n\n&gt;$ME \"Computer mouse. I found a dead COMPUTER mouse in the cupboard.\"\n\nShe turned bright red at that.\n\nHow is this a tale about me getting what I deserved? Since I made the vague statement, I volunteered to call up and cancel the exterminator. They were very understanding about the mixup, after it took them a full minute to stop laughing at me.",

This is the same company from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7dq5b8/printer_upgrade_gone_wrong/), $OfficeAdmin is the same guy, as is $Minion. $Boss is our MSP's owner.\n\nThere I am, enjoying a relatively quiet Friday afternoon, dreaming of a relatively quiet weekend...when $Minion contacts me via $InstantMessagingTool:\n\n&gt; $Minion: Hey hyperpuma, you working today?\n\nUh oh. \n\n&gt; $Me: Yeah, what's up? \n\n&gt; $Minion: $OfficeAdmin has 4 laptops he is going to throw out and wants me to put a nail through the hard drives as opposed to just wiping them. He says this is the process. Just wanted to confirm with you first if you knew\n\nI stare at the message for a few seconds before bursting into laughter. Sure, I heard of people physically destroying HDDs for secure \"retirement\", but driving a nail through? Who is he, Van Hellsing?\n\n&gt; $Me: Nope, had no idea. HDDs are remarkably resilient when it comes to data, so normally they are overwritten multiple times if the owner wants to completely prevent data recovery. A “format” is no more effective than tearing the index page out of a book, the data is still there \n\n&gt; $Minion: Ah right. Never knew that\n\n&gt; $Me: Industry-accepted standard is that every sector on HDDs get overwritten with 0s and 1s (up to 7 times) to completely make the data unrecoverable\n\n&gt; $Minion: How would one do that?\n\n&gt; $Me: There are specialised programs like DBAN\n\n&gt; $Minion: I was just going to disk utility and reformat it to windows, then back to mac\n\n&gt; $Me: No, that will accomplish nothing. Data will still be recoverable. Physically destroying the HDD will do the job, but I hate destroying perfectly functional HDDs. Such a waste\n\n&gt; $Minion: Roger that\n\nThen, a few minutes later…\n\n&gt; $Minion: I think i'll just destroy the drive then. Seems like the best option, without specialised software\n\n&gt; $Me: Yeah, there are a number of ways\n\n&gt; $Me: Powerful magnets will kill a drive quite fast\n\n&gt; $Me: A nail will also do the job. You can pretend you’re staking the evil Count Datacula!\n\n&gt; $Minion: Haha, thanks hyperpuma!\n\n&gt; $Me: Just confirm with $Boss what he wants to do before you proceed.\n\n$Minion contacts $Boss and confirms that yes, driving a nail through is indeed the $Client’s chosen method of HDD retirement. The world is once again safe from the evils of vampire HDDs and I go back to my important Friday arvo work (browsing the interwebs) still grumbling about waste. ",

        "text": "About 6 years ago I started work at a POS company (Point of Sale) that mainly sold to restaurants doing anything from service, installations, networking and database programming.  We held the franchise for selling the POS system in our state, but when corporate had a sale for a location in our state we would be the on-the-ground hardware/installation techs. \n\nThis was my first week on the job, although I already had some experience with the system from several years before when I had tried my hand at sales (realized after about a year that it was not my thing).  I was paired with an older tech ($Oldtech) to go out on an installation for a new restaurant system inside of a big name hotel chain and we were to be the hardware install and on-site live support for the next day as well - this was my first experience outside of training in the office.  The plan was to get there in the morning, install all of the equipment, get it all fired up and then have it run side by side with their old system to help find where the programming would need to be adjusted.  Pretty simple right?  Of course not!\n\nProblem 1: In walking into the \"IT Closet\" (which was not any more than a storage room for anything and everything) there was not any sort of cable management in site and we had to actually duck under a network cable to get into the room, on top of that the network guys for the hotel had ran new cabling for us, but didn’t label anything so it took about 30 minutes just to tone out the right ports for our equipment.  No biggie, 20 minutes and we had all the ports labeled.\n\nProblem 2: The old system had two terminals (as did the new system), but the kitchen printer for the old system ran off the second terminal situated just inside the kitchen.  So when the network guys ran new cables they ran the exact same configuration meaning a cable that begins at the prep counter, goes up and over the ceiling and comes back down and terminates inside the kitchen. Unfortunately on the new system the kitchen printer ran off the server itself so to combat this we were able to temporarily use a patch cable to jumper from one jack to another and had them put in a request to fix this with their network guys.  (This would later come back to bite us as even though we labeled “Do not touch” someone had the bright idea to bring their laptop and plug it in so they could watch Netflix while prepping early in the morning - needless to say their network guys fixed it the very next day)\n\nProblem 3: Being the newbie I was tasked with getting the terminals installed and up and running since they were just a little bit more than thin clients and all of the software needed was pulled directly from the server while $Oldtech setup the server and configured everything.  My part went off without a hitch, thankfully, so I bullshit with the bartender for a while before I head back off to the network closet as it is just before the lunch rush and just as a large group is trying to checkout of the hotel.  As I am returning to the network closest to see what else was needed from the $Oldtech I was greeted with a shouting match between $Oldtech and $SiteManager.  Now one thing you have to realize is to get to the network closet we had to pass through all the administration offices and the closet was at the end of the hall.  Turns out from the time I finished and everything was working till the time I returned to the closet the entire system had gone offline...not only that, but everything from the phone lines to the front desk check-in system was also down.  The $SiteManager was trying to blame $Oldtech, while $Oldtech was trying to blame how bad the network closet was and how it wasn’t his fault.  (I came to find out later that  $Oldtech was notorious for getting in heated “talks” with customers and was part of the reason I was sent out with him).  So as they are yelling and the $SiteManager is threatening to call the police unless $Oldtech fixes whatever he did I sneak in to take a look.  Everything seems in its place (as much as it could seem).  As I started poking around I realized that about half of the things on their rack didn’t have power including our new server.  I traced the power cords to everything and finally found a giant UPS sitting on the floor behind the rack with all of the power plugs full.  I started doing some troubleshooting - firstly the UPS seemed to be power cycling which I thought was odd.  So I pulled the plug for our new server and plugged it directly into a wall outlet, bypassing any UPS.  Sure enough - powered on just fine.  So I try doing this with a couple other items and sure enough same result, everything powers on.  I figured it was the UPS going bad so I started pulling all the cables when I notice it - with the new system we came a new laser printer and guess where $Oldtech plugged it into?  You guessed it, one of the backup battery ports of the UPS.  Now, as I have realized there are some people who do not know how much power a printer can draw - to put it simply, more than a normal backup battery can output and therefore you never plug them into a battery back, only a surge protecter or line conditioner if anything.  So without saying anything to $Oldtech and $SiteManager I removed the printer from the UPS and saw it come on just fine.  I plugged everything back into their respective ports and watched as everything seemed to power back on.  Then I calmly and carefully went up to $SiteManager and $Oldtech to let them know that everything should be coming back online in a few minutes as soon as everything reboots and that they might want to check to see if everything was working. $Oldtech was sceptical and kept muttering something to the effect of “Yea right newbie what else did you screw up” which I ignored and just directed the $SiteManager to please go check the different systems to verify everything is working properly.\n\nEnd result:  Everything came back online just fine (thankfully!).  The phone system was working again, the front desk was able to check the large group out and the restaurant was able to get through lunch rush with only a handful of written tickets that had to be entered into their system due to the outtage.  $SiteManager thanked me, called his bosses, who called our owner to let him know that $Oldtech was not to be allowed back on property and that I was requested to come do live support the next day.  The next day went off without any many issues (that fortunately were easily solved with a quick phone call to the corporate programmer) and I was not only given free meals that day (which I found out was pretty typical for live support in restaurants, yea!) but was also comped an dinner for two anytime I wanted to bring my wife. All in all not a bad way to show my worth when starting a new job and the best part was the $Oldtech was let go not too long after that for “job performance issues”, but we all know that he got canned after one too many yelling matches with customers on the phone.\n",

        "text": "I got a call the other night that roughly 75% of the trucks at a distribution center can't ship.  A bunch of orders weren't able to be processed for picking.  \n\nThe company I work for writes custom applications for warehouses and DCs.  For this client, the system is designed to not allow any order lines to be shorted once we import the data from their host system. (Something they demanded during the project phase)\n\nAfter getting on the server and digging through our logs, I finally find it in the cubing logic. It calculates the volume of the product going on the trucks.  Unhandled exception. DIVIDE BY ZERO.  Really?\n\nUnlucky me, the log messages don't have enough detail to tell me the specific product that's crashing the service, so I have to come up with some sql scripts to try to find the common denimonator across all the bad orders.  After a few minutes I see it.  A single box cereal.  Kashi GoLean.  Looks like every store that ordered it can't process, and the other orders are fine.  Hmmm... the plot thickens... I check through the database tables where all product info is stored and tied to the cereal, and boom, there it is.  Weight = 0.0000.\n\nThey send us the product weight and dimension data, so I call them back and ask how much their cereal weighs.   The have no idea. So I ended up just making up a number and updating the record, then triggered all the orders to process again.  This time they allocated and were good to go.\n\nAfterwards I sent an email to one of our devs suggesting he might want to add some better error handling to the code, because basically a box of cereal had just shut down a DC.",

        "text": "There is a legend in the military of a mythical creature we call ‘The Good Idea Fairy’, referred to in short as “GIF.”  It is unknown if the GIF is actually an evil demonspawn or just a misguided Tinkerbellian Lieutenant, but its trail of dismay and destruction is unmistakable.  The GIF is the origin of many classic ideas: deploying a new system to production without testing;  leaving the brand new Lieutenant unsupervised among a rabid pack of E-4 Mafia; marrying that stripper that’s been divorced six times, has three kids, and signing all of your assets to her name just before deploying.  The GIF can lay its sweaty palms upon all, be it upper management to ‘fix’ what isn’t broken to the lowest janitor to ride the floor buffer just once—no one is safe.\n\nNo one.\n\n***\nIt was a snowy evening at $AviationCompany, and Second Shift had just finished bringing an aircraft into Bay 4.  I was in early for some overtime and while I waited for my own aircraft to show up, was asked to lend them a hand getting set up.  \n\n&gt;**Lead1** “Hey, Zee, go help $HorseHead ($HH) get a stair stand for the front door for this plane.”\n\nI piled onto the flatbed golf cart $HH was driving after having him pointed out to me—I have no idea why he’s named so, but…..well, I don’t want to get ahead of myself.\n\nWe drove down the hallway to bay 5, where a Very Large aircraft was parked in the center.  On the far side of the plane was the shorter stair stand we would need for our own small aircraft, so we drove up to it and looked it over, trying to figure out how to tow it since it had no tow hook.  Suddenly, in a ray of gentle light, the Good Idea Fairy descended upon me.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Hey, $HH, I’ve got a great idea—I’ll sit on the back of the cart, hold onto it, and you drive us—slowly—to Bay 4!”\n\n$HH, also enveloped in the absolute *brilliance* of the Good Idea, agreed and I sat myself down facing rearward on the back of the flatbed cart, holding onto the stand.  He started forward, and the brilliance grew exponentially as he took a shortcut—very swiftly.  Instead of cutting to the aft of the large aircraft and going under the much, much taller tail, he cut a more direct route across the hangar and directly beneath said aircraft.  Meanwhile, the speed at which we were moving were causing the stand’s caster wheels to shake uncontrollably and I very quickly lost contr---\n\n#***THUNK***\n\nThe stand stopped abruptly, lodged firmly against the belly of the aircraft near a service door. \n\n***\n*I sat in the safety meeting, uncomfortable and tired.  The new $UpperManager had decided to make an appearance, and was telling us his new pet policy on the heels of several aircraft damage incidents.*\n\n&gt;**$UpperManager** “I will make an example of the next person who damages an aircraft!”\n\n*A knot of dread settled itself in my stomach, and for some reason I knew in my heart that the next idiot would be me.*\n\n***\n\nI pushed the stand back and stared at the gouge in the aluminum fuselage.  $HH had turned around, saw what happened and told me to hurry up.  I decided to push the stand down to Bay 4, and then I rejoined him on the cart.  We drove back down to Bay 5 and looked the plane over—the gouge was a bright, silver scar on the plane’s belly, and I felt my gut knot tighter and tighter.  \n\n&gt;**$HH** “We can’t tell *anyone* about this.  We need to stop looking at it, come on.  \n\nI just nodded weakly and stepped off the cart, exited the bay and sat in the emergency stairwell outside the hangar, a place of solitude I enjoyed going to when I needed alone-time at work.  I knew what I needed to do, but I was rightly terrified by what I had just brought down upon myself.  I made a couple phone calls for advice on how best to approach this, and then I went and found $HH.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “I can’t do this.  I need to tell them what happened. That plane needs to get fixed.”\n\n&gt;**$HH** “You can’t tell them I was a part of it!  I’m on my last warning already!  If you tell them, I will lose my job!”\n\nIt turns out $HH had managed to damage at least four aircraft previously—to include, infamously, placing a jack on the water drain (surrounded by bright letters saying “DO NOT JACK HERE”) instead of the jacking point two feet forward of the drain and punching through the belly of the poor aircraft.  I, being still a fairly new mechanic at $AviationCompany, didn’t want to cost anyone their job.\n\n&gt;**Zeewulf**  “I’ll leave you out of it then….”\n\n$HH took off immediately and didn’t say another thing.  I, meanwhile, hunted down my lead.\n\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Hey, $Lead1…bad news.  I was towi—er pulling a stand and hit the plane in Bay 5.”\n\nHe went out with me to look at it and got a suspicious look on his face. \n\n&gt;**$Lead** “Really?”  \n\nHe waved over a couple other Leads, they conferred for a moment, and then turned back to me.  \n\n&gt;**$Lead1**  “So..by yourself, you pushed the stair stand hard enough and fast enough to do *that* to the plane?”  \n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Well, I was pulling it, I mean, and…”\n\n&gt;**$Lead1**  “I see.  All by yourself?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Well, I…uh…\n\nLet me take a moment to say that I’m a terrible liar, and here I was trying to lie by omission.  I knew I was toast, and they could tell I’d had some help making the mess.  I gave up trying to protect #HH.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “..I had help from $HH.  I sat on the back of the golf card and pulled it ^while ^^he ^^^drove… “\n\n$Lead1 brought me back to the Lead office and left me in there alone to type up a statement.  I did so, and while I was working on it $HH burst in.  \n\n&gt;**$HH** “What the hell, man, I thought you weren’t going to tell them I was in it?!”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “I can’t lie!  I suck at it, and I won’t do it….”\n\n&gt;**$HH** “Well did you at least keep quiet about the golf cart?!”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Of course not!  I told them *everything!*”\n\n&gt;**$$** “Damnit!  Now I have to re-write my statement!”\n\n$HH stormed out of the lead office in a huff, leaving me by myself—or so I thought.  Ever so slowly, $Lead2 poked his head out of his cubicle, looking at me with upraised eyebrows.  \n\n***\n$Lead1 brought me back out to the floor and over to $Artist, a man who’s sheetmetal expertise and ability is simply at a level of artistry I do not understand.  \n\n\n&gt;**$Lead1**  “Help $Artist here in looking for the repair in the Structural Repair Manual.  Let’s see if we can at least keep this in-house.”\n\nI loaded the repair manual on a computer, but my heart sank as I was greeted by a warning on the cover page:\n\n###Warning: Aircraft 1234 through 1240 have received the Maximum Take-Off Weight Increase Modification and the Structural Repair Manual is no longer effective.  Please contact $AircraftManufacturer for all repair instructions.\n\nOh, fishsticks.  This was aircraft 1236--there was no way we were going to be able to keep this in house anymore.  Which meant that I was immediately sent for urinalysis and then home waiting for the results and a call from $UpperManager who would be deciding my fate...\n",

One of the things they told us in training was that we are not suppose to troubleshoot people's computer and to get the number of the manufacture and provide it to the customer to get additional help. Because they tell us even though you maybe able to get it working they expect that level of service every time they call in and the next person they get may not have that level of knowledge to get a computer working. \n\nSo I get a call and the guy tells me that he has two laptops, one is able to get online the other one can't. I tell him that since one laptop is working and the other is not it is a problem with the laptop itself. I find out the manufacture of the laptop and get the number for their tech support. \n\nHe then asks, \"Is that it, you not going to even troubleshoot?\" I told him that we know the internet is working because the other laptop is able to get online. He then says, \"I know but it seems that you are just trying to hand me off to some one else to get this working.\"(or something like that, I do not remember) So it seems that he is not gonna let me go until I try something. I ask him if it is connected to the wifi, he said yes. So i then have him hover the mouse over the network icon next to the time. I asked him what does it say, \"not connected, no networks available\". \n\nI then told it could  two things, either the wifi adapter is broken or the driver is corrupt/missing. I then asked if he is able to directly connect the laptop the router. He said he does not know to do that, then says he does not have a cable. So then it hit me, the wifi adapter might be turned off. I tell him to look at the \"F\" keys at the top of the keyboard and look for one that has a wifi symbol. He found it and was able to re-enable the wifi on the laptop. I asked to see if he can get online, he said he can.\n\nBut now he was more upset at me because I was able to get it working. I told him that wasn't even suppose to troubleshot his laptop, just the services that we offer. He then said, \"I understand that but you were able too, instead you wanted to hand me off onto some one else. You were able to troubleshot and that have been the first thing out your mouth.\" Well I was stunned for a moment and actually sat there for a few seconds speechless, I then asked if he had anymore questions. Then he basically hung up on me. \n\n",
