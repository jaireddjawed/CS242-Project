At some point I flicked through a few pages of the deal on my own, but it's just far too much information to take in in any feasible way.\n\nAre there any lawyers or scholars out there who have a decent grasp on the TPP and what ratifying/passing it would mean for the nations who signed on? In order to spur some measure of objectivity, I challenge you to write a \"pro\" for every \"con\". If I want to hear about someone shitting on how it'll revive Moloch and bring about the end times I have plenty of other sources to go to",

        "text": "I myself come from Lithuania. Our universities don't give two shits of a fuck about our feelings or personal issues, they just care about how well you do in class. I was talking about this to an American friend of mine and he introduced me to the fact that American universities are becoming these super caring safe spaces for students. Naturally, my first reaction was *\"Oh that's really cool!\"*.\n\nSadly, when we talked some more he told me it's much more extreme than I thought - it's to the level where some +students seem to become really detached from reality. For example thinking that anyone who thinks differently from them is a threat, or that they are the center of the universe and if someone doesn't treat them with utmost respect, deserved or not, they will automatically assume you're harassing them. Even worse, their feelings sometimes come above their ability to learn, which seems completely absurd to me! \n\nHow much of this is true? How did this come to be? Is it like that in all universities? Why do the universities actually think this is a good idea? Because from what I see, those students will be absolutely devastated when they graduate and have to face working for an actual job where customers come before them.",

When he was sixteen my father took him driving along empty county roads, and my brother drove them into a ditch after he was distracted by a rabbit. He has been incapable of holding a job, driving, or monitoring his own finances.\n\n So far he has been entirely uninterested in the election, instead opting for his habitual reruns of the Arthur and Barney shows we used to watch as children. My parents have guardianship over him, and it is clear he could never live independently. \n\nDespite his severely limited academic and critical thinking skills, he still has a healthy desire for social life. He has friends and he goes to a special needs school. He sees others going to vote, and wants to go vote as well. As of last week, he legally voted for a candidate in the state of Texas.\n\nI know my parents tell him how to vote, as my father jokingly told me about an argument they had after the primaries when my dad insisted he vote one candidate as my mother insisted he vote another.\n\nIn many states, I read, it would be illegal for him to vote. I strongly believe my parents should not have taken him to vote, but I also ask myself how the laws should be. Why is he legally allowed to vote at all? Are the current voting laws just towards severally mentally disabled citizens? I would love to hear your thoughts Reddit.",

        "text": "One argument for against the war on drugs is that it potentially (or does) stigmatizes drug use, thereby putting already disadvantaged individuals (re: drug users) at risk by relegating most of them to urban slums, putting them at risk of persecution of law enforcement and destroying families / communities.\n\nOn the other hand, history has told us that large-scale deregulation and widespread availability of narcotic and hard substances can similarly destroy communities and families, and cause significant national strife. The best example for this are the Chinese Opium Wars and the opium trade in China.\n\nI am very interested to hear about alternatives to the War on Drugs from other perspectives.\n\nIn addition, for the purposes of this argument, it is best to toss aside references to Cannabis in particular, due to the controversial nature of whether or not Cannabis should be legal. Rather, the discussion should assume the war on drugs as being focused on hard drugs (narcotics, Meth, cocaine, crack, opiates, etc.) instead.\n\nEDIT: **I know this is tempting to answer with one-liner comments, but please provide at least some semblance of reasoning for your arguments.**",

Or any crime that was not once true, or did not happen, there is now the tech to make it so it happened, entirely believable...or it just needs minor perfections.\n\nIt gives thought for governments of the world that probably won't tell its average citizen of the technology, while keeping it for themselves.\n\n\nA video of something like that is hear, and I am certain voice ones exist now(I don't know where to find it, but its nothing nefarious...just have not web-scrummed enough)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk\n\nIts very clearly the case that tech just needs fine-tuning to accurately replicate anyone.

It's not illegal but it's not smart and could endanger your life e.g. Riding without proper gear on.\n\nBut I turn around and tell my audience: \"See what i'm doing? It's stupid. I'm a moron for doing it and I don't usually do it. You shouldn't take example of this. Go by what I say not as I do. I should be wearing full gear but I made a mistake of not doing so this time around.\"\n\nHow does that stand with people? It's understandably a form of hypocrisy but I'm saying you shouldn't do it. And doing everything I can to convey the message across. I've already considered answers like \"well why did you upload it in the first place?\" or \"What if there's that one guy who do as I did and got himself killed?\"\n\nHow does this sit with everyone here?",
