        "text": " I was aiming to publish the results in a conference paper but due to my lack of confidence in them and also insufficient validation from PI, I had to hold back. Consequentially, I lost faith in the problem, which affected the momentum to work. PI then reassigned the thesis topic to another project, which I had to start from scratch. I still didn't lose heart because I could still use my prior experience and move forward. I know it takes time to meaningfully formulate the problem but I'm scared and paralyzed by self doubt and fear that I wouldn't be able to finish it either. My mind goes into a \"what-if\" mode since this was a leap of faith I took to move away from conventional engineering career path and coding is not something that came to me naturally. My self esteem takes a hit in literally every weekly lab-meeting since I have no good results. At this point I feel like a terrible and sub-par grad student.   \nPS: Just for the reference, I'm a masters student in robotics.",

I am now wondering if a masters degree is worthwhile, even if it fully funded. I have looked into programs like data analytics, statistics, and computer science but I am unsure if a master degree would offer a significant improvement in my career prospects. The program I am most interested in is data sciences/analytics.\n\nIf anyone has any insight or experience with any of these kinds of masters degree I would really appreciate hearing if you thought it was worthwhile and what kind of work you do now.",

Now, I have 2 Qs :\n\n1) in specific terms , what should I look for when selecting a supervisor for a summer peoject ?\n\n2 ) among the following options , which ones would you say will not suit me as much, also considering that I'm shooting for medicine :\n\nOPTION A : Nice prof , small lab in a hospital in a ahared space , 2-3 other members, said It'l be a good opportunity for you but I think you will not have significant results ( said his team is not getting much phenotypes on their model animals too, meaning the research is quite slow ) ( though I think geberally getting a meaningful scientific acheievement after only 4 months of eesearch as an undergrad is not a typical occurance anyways, ao maybe he was just straight up honest w me ? )\n\nOPTION B : Good prof , works on effects if food and food components on health , his research topics are not my favorite, but techniques involve interesting things such as lotta cell culture and possibly working with CBD. \n\nOPTION C : great prof , one of my favorites, super nice person , knows his things , officially announced in class he's taking nserc students , works on repoductivity in dairy cow models mostly, but is relatively ( not so much but relatively ) new to field and does not have that high of an h-index ( I don't care much  about that stuff, but I reckon since I only have this one chance ( time wise ) for a full-time summer project , I might be better off doing it w a PI who's been in the field for long and had more trainees ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-",

In undergrad, I would handwrite my lecture notes and type reading notes. I study English literature and for the most part readings are novels with articles thrown in there and it was just faster to type notes or keep track of page numbers with quotes I'd highlighted and why I had marked it. Sometimes I literally just have a piece of paper with pages numbers on it and a theme word next to it. Not very detailed but it worked. When my course was done, I would never go back to my old notes and they are now in the land of lost. \n\nNow that I am doing my masters, I am lost and full of anxiety about how I should be taking notes. I was doing my old system till I had a few other students (they are in a PhD program and I am in a MA) tell me that I needed to make notes that were searchable since projects would go past a singer term, and I need to start a system where I have a database of the articles I have read and notes on them that I can search. Everyone has their two cents on how I should be keeping notes and I am lost at which is best. \n\nI have ADHD and I like changing between hand written and typed notes. They are not organized in a way people would understand but I do manage to find things if they are typed. I use Notion of my typed notes and for essay planning and all that jazz. Handwritten notes... not so searchable. I know I can use a digital note-taking app but I find them too distracting and again lots of options...\n\nShould I give up handwriting notes? Or type them up after? But that seems time consuming.. I just don't know. I know this is a really silly thing to be frozen on but I am starting my thesis and I literally can't because I am scared of losing notes or not having them searchable while also worrying about losing the benefits of handwriting notes and doing freewrites. I worry that I will forget everything, worry that I won't be able to find something I need in the future. I worry that everything is important... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny Advice?",

Is this something I can do? Is it totally dependent on how my advisor is? I’d love to hear any similar situations.",

I feel like it will be a great career for me but the steps to get there just seems so hard. I hate science classes… biology, chemistry, physics,they are so boring and hard. I wish I could truly learn it but instead I have to cram 3 pages of material for every exam in the class. My grades are meh… ofc I excel in math and psychology but when it’s comes to bio and Chem I always get C’s no matter how hard I try. I reach out to tutors, to professors, I look on YouTube and it’s just too much and it frustrates me. I’m the kind of person who if I don’t find it interesting or useful I won’t be fully absorbed into the material. \nDo I even have a shot at Nursing school? It’s like these classes are my main issue that’s ruining my goal. I’m still going to apply and reach out to the schools but I can’t help but feel hopeless. :(",

I am really excited to be done with school and looking forward to finally starting my career (I went straight from undergrad to grad). In talking with people around me, I am finding that a few people are suggesting I get an internship after graduation. I'm not opposed to internships, I've done two thus far, both for extended periods of time, and both gave me quite a bit of experience. My issue is that when I talk to some people, they suggest I get an internship almost to imply that I am still not in a position for a full-time job. It's got me feeling a bit defeated before I even really start applying to jobs (I'm in the process currently). I really thought that with my experience (combined two years of experience with my internships, four if you want to count my client-based professional graduate program), and my almost two degrees, I'd be qualified for a full-time gig right out of grad school. I look at these internship positions and they offer $15-$20 an hour, and ask for current undergrads and sometimes recent undergrads and postgrads, and all I can think is that I'm qualified for more than that. I'm not asking for anything crazy, it's just that at this point, I'm getting paid significantly better, and for significantly less work as a TA than I will once I've actually obtained a master's degree. Not to mention, when applying to internships last year while in my graduate school city, I was rejected from all but one because (and I have no proof for this, it's just a feeling so I could be wrong) I was now over qualified! It was even a point of discussion in my most recent internships interview, that the organization was getting a great deal on someone who already had a bachelor's degree, was halfway through a graduate program, and was getting paid $14 an hour!\n\nI don't want to sound ungrateful or entitled, I promise I'm not, and I know the economy isn't great now and I'm applying to jobs in a state that has some of the lowest if not THE lowest unemployment rate in the US. I just want to work full-time and have a real position, not another LTE or seasonal internship. Am I being unreasonable to think I can really get a full-time gig? or am I in for a big wake-up call regarding my qualifications?",

        "text": "As people start to get acceptances (yay!) thought it might be useful for general thread about how to interpret financial offers and what questions are worth asking, since as many know \"fully funded\" can mean a lot of different things. My advice is geared towards U.S.-based fully-funded PhD programs since that's what I know, but others may have advice about other programs too. \n\nWhen you're considering offers, you want to figure out what your actual take home pay will be, which will vary based on a several factors. \n\nGuaranteed income (this is what is listed in your offer letter)\n\n* Stipend: salary, usually paid over 12 months (\"summer funding\") or 9 months (\"no summer funding\")\\* note, if it's a 9-month salary you may have the opportunity to work for additional salary in the remaining 3 months but that's not guaranteed.  \n* Fellowship year: you do not have to do work beyond your own research and/or coursework to received your salary\n* TAship, GAship, RAship, assistantship year: you will have to do additional work to receive your salary (teaching, lab work, research assistant, other university work)\n* Entry grant/research grant: additional money for research expenses, usually one time. This might be a lump sum, or might be a reimbursement-based. \n* Health coverage: the university will pay some or all of your insurance premium (the annual fee to have insurance) \n* tuition remission/tuition credit: the university will pay your tuition \n\nSet costs (these probably won't be listed in your offer letter)\n\n* additional healthcare costs: you may be required to pay part of your insurance premium. You may have the option to add on vision and/or dental care plans.\n* student fees: you probably are required to pay some student fee on a semester or annual basis. This is theoretically for \"campus services\" like the gym, student centers, transportation, etc. \n* taxes: fellowship income is taxable!! Federal and state, and you can google a simple tax calculator if you want a ballpark number \n* advanced student fees: sometimes after a certain number of semesters or years you have to start paying a \"holding\" fee to stay enrolled \n* parking pass, if you drive to campus \n\nGuaranteed income minus set costs should give you a basic sense of the \"adjusted\" salary. Once you have that, current students are a great resources for asking how livable the salary actually is. Some good questions for day-to-day life: where do people live? do they have roommates? are you able to save any money/pay down debt? do people generally look for extra work? is it easy to find? are there regular cost of living increases and are they effective? \n\nThis is more for the humanities folks out there than the science folks, but you should *not* spend your stipend on research costs! (travel, technology, hiring assistants, etc.) So also worth asking: what sources of research funding are there? have you gotten them? what to they cover (e.g. laptops, books, travel, food, etc.)?\n\nWhat are other questions about finance you think prospective should ask?",

I will also be *working on my Master's thesis* with lab work I will conduct there.\n\nHowever, she did not answer my follow-up questions and reminders - like, 'Hey Prof XX, who can I meet to access the lab while you're away remotely in January', or 'Those staff who you tasked with preparing the internship contract (4 weeks ago) - do you have an update for me?'.\n\nBy the way - I can't leave the lab because I registered it for my internship requirement of my Master's program. \n\nAfter pressing the clerk of the lab (who reports directly to the lab head) on the contract, she started gaslighting with various contradictory excuses like claiming to never have been informed, then claiming I wrote only last week when it was literally in **early-mid December**. \n\nProblem is the lab head is protecting her and making it out like I am being unreasonable and hostile for pushing for action. The clerk also tried to kick a fuss with my study office and internship module coordinator, but they are more perplexed than against me, with the study office itself definitely being supportive of me.\n\nMy main issue is this: After my Master's, I want to continue working at my university as a researcher (other labs of course), and thereafter a PhD in another country.\n\nWhat actions should I take to mitigate the risks to those goals? Given that the lab will be mentioned in the Master's Thesis, and I suppose future labs might ask for a character reference from this.\n\nThanks everyone!",

In my department, the class sizes are more like 8, but this class is 16 so I understand the professor wanting us to break off into smaller groups for discussions.  The problem is that we do at least one, often two participatory learning activities in pairs or individually (with an instruction sheet) then discuss in pairs, as smaller groups, then as a class.  2 - 3 peers need to volunteer the week before to summarize selected readings to the class and we discuss the articles after each presentation together.  Then there is sometimes another activity crammed in to the same 4 hours.    \nI feel like I have whiplash in this class.    \nIt's a 4 hour game of musical chairs.    \nFor an 800 level course, I often feel like we are doing \"make-work\" projects that are not very helpful for those with research experience or who are near the end of their program.  I'm someone who genuinely enjoys a traditional learning style and find listening to lectures and learning with the aid of slides useful, but it's too late for me to drop the class now.  This might be a \"me\" problem, but I have experienced this in other courses where a professor is so committed to participatory learning activities and not being one-way that I don't feel like I'm learning from them as experts in their field and am instead completing a series workbook exercises.  A theme of this course is co-creation of knowledge, and I get that these activities model ways of applying this in our own research. This professor does not spend a lot of time talking other than general group facilitation stuff like introducing the agenda for the day and letting us know when to make groups or take breaks.  I'm a pretty sociable person and have made friends in the class, but feel frustrated by the heavy reliance on contrived paired and group activities.  The professor has put a lot of effort into designing the activities and I appreciate that as opposed to someone totally phoning it in (which I experienced last semester with a prof who decided to turn our 3 hour class into a 1 hour lecture using recycled slides literally the day after receiving tenure halfway through the term).  Is this something to live with until the semester is over and gently include my feedback in the end of term course evaluation?",

        "text": "I did a +1 masters in psychology after I graduated in December 2021. Started in January 2022 on my thesis under a PI I had for my honors thesis too. Work in a developmental lab. PI told me I needed to recruit 25 infants between 3 and 18 months starting in March 2022. I started sending emails to parents from our database that had not been updated since COVID because… I guess nobody recruited since then?? So I was asking parents if they had any new children THEN asking if they could participate. Sent literally 100s of emails to parents. Begged for help recruiting during the summer, crickets from the post doc, lab manager, and PI. Ended up having to recruit from friends of family friends and got 19 by the end of the summer after driving 6 hours back and forth several times to my hometown. \n\nAt this point, I was ready to start analyzing despite the fact I was short on participants (mind you I had to defend my thesis in December), but then my PI said we needed to aim for 30 babies. Other studies in this realm have literally had anywhere from 4-16 participants, so idk where he got 30 from. I appease my PI anyway and got up to 27 by November and I started to freak out. I sent him drafts of my thesis up until analyses, results, and discussion, and he took a week to 10 days to respond with edits for each version i sent. \n\nI found out from the registrar I could extend my defense until January 27th, push my grad date back, and not have to register for another semester which would be a lot of money for me (~1k a credit hour). PI said that’s totally doable! But then he didn’t respond to my emails for like 3 weeks over Christmas holiday. \n\nWe met in person the first week of January and he was insistent that I get results together to submit to a conference by the 15th, so suddenly that was the priority. He also dropped an absolute bomb on me: he was not gonna be around for in-person meetings anymore because he was moving to another university in another state a week from then! Seemed very sus for a tenured prof at a pretty high quality school.\nAlso, I applied to PhD programs this cycle, so I was starting to hear back from programs and he was giving me a ton of unsolicited advice about where I needed to go. (Mostly just shitting on Southern schools even though these are the most realistic for my finances and my family).\n\nLong story short, I didn’t meet the thesis deadline on the 27th and I had to shell out the money to register for one credit this semester. I sent my PI a draft with analyses and graphs on the 23rd, and he JUST responded with his edits up to the method section saying that it is “too wordy” and that I’m missing a ton of stuff (it’s literally exactly the same as the first 10 drafts I sent him). He also says that the post doc I was begging to help me with recruitment suddenly has babies’ info to send me and that we need to get N up to 32 to publish! I STILL HAVENT DEFENDED MY THESIS. \n\nWhat do I do? Like I am done doing free labor for this lab. It’s not even free labor… i would be paying the university to collect data for 5 more participants on a project that has already been accepted to conference. Plus, i already have acceptances to PhD programs. I have never been good about establishing boundaries with this guy, but it’s getting ludicrous. He is so disorganized, and it feels super disrespectful that he knew my thesis deadlines this whole time yet gave me no guidance and then decided to move schools while I’m in the middle of it.",

In the short/medium-term, I imagine nonprofit/social impact consulting or philanthropy/corporate responsibility.\n\nI was a low-income, first-gen traditional student and thankfully didn't have to take out a ton in loans (will be paid off this year). I'm grateful to have reached a salary of $85k, and haven't found that a master's is *necessary* anywhere I've applied. I primarily want to get a master's for the experience, to be a student again and take classes I wish I did as an undergrad, and to elevate and future-proof my career. I also care about building community and networks, so I feel like a full-time program would be much more valuable than a part-time program.\n\nGot my first acceptance, but with ~50% tuition scholarship. That would mean ~$70K still to pay/borrow, not incl. living expenses — and I was also considering applying to add on an MBA once matriculated *(I now think I should've applied for both programs at the same time so I'd know the full aid/debt picture to make the best informed decision)*, so not incl. those costs either.\n\nPlus, I've recently been concerned by reading a lot more about how many grad programs are essentially cash cows for schools. I have little interest in pursuing a PhD.\n\nTl;dr: I'm hesitant about taking on so much debt. How have you (or someone you know) decided if the degree was worth the time &amp; money? Did you regret your decision, or wish you approached it differently?",

        "text": "Hi everyone. Posting for my wife here - hoping some of you may have some answers for some of her questions!\n\nMy wife has recently applied to several creative writing MFA programs. Mainly low-residency, distance programs that are unfunded. She is starting to hear back from the programs and is having some second thoughts about the potential usefulness of the degree in the long run. \n\nMy wife loves writing and is very successful of it. She has helped develop 2 publication journals, one at the institutional level and one state-wide one. She has won multiple awards for her writing and recently wrote an undergraduate thesis (\\~100 pages) that was very well received and (according to the defense committee) has a strong potential for publication in the future. Her LOR writers include a nationally-famous author who has won American Book Awards and was state writer laureate. To put it blankly, she is good at writing and in an ideal world, it would be her career. Her BA is in English, not creative writing, so she is mainly looking for more writing education, workshop, and time to write. \n\nHowever, she has some concerns about pursuing the MFA. She has been encouraged to by multiple professors and it was sold to her as being a \"magic bullet\" to getting a teaching or writing career. However, reading other people's opinions online it does not seem to be as good as was promised by said professors. The 50k sticker tag is also a little iffy. We luckily don't have much student loan debt, so the MFA would more than double it. I want to encourage her to pursue her goals, but I won't lie - spending 50K for a degree that has no promise of a high-paying career does scare me a little. I suppose the good news is that with a distance program there is the potential to work during the day, which may help pay for tuition.\n\nAnyway, she is curious to know people's thoughts who have attended or are attending MFA programs, especially anyone who is doing a distance MFA. What do you think about your program?",

        "text": "I'll try to keep the narrative exposition to a minimum and provide more details as they're requested. 2nd-year M.S. student, made the brilliant decision of enrolling as a thesis student when I started out (well it seemed brilliant at the time). I officially joined the lab in May of last year and throughout that summer, I thought it best not to bug my advisor too much and only provide vague updates at weekly lab meetings to make it seem like I could work independently. Behind the scenes (and as a result), I spent 3 months reading through relevant literature and papers published by the lab to identify a good research topic and came up with nothing. Come late August I started to get worried that I wasn't getting anywhere, and a couple weeks later I mustered up the courage to have a very blunt one-on-one discussion with my advisor, where I made it very clear that I had no idea where to go with my research. She outlined some expectations for my research in a very muddled way, and although I got the gist of it, I still felt like she didn't even know what she wanted the outcome to look like.\n\nWhatever, so I went ahead with what I got from our meeting and started with the lowest-hanging fruit: literally just putting together a physical set-up for my experiment. I thought it would be easy. She thought it would be easy. I thought I'd have my set-up completely ready by December and that I would have data by the end of 2022, even if only preliminary. She thought that too!\n\n\\-- SURPRISE! None of those predictions came true. --\n\nFast-forward to today and I'm only about 40% done with my set-up. Per a project timeline that I made for myself a few months ago, I'm now supposed to start my first - and hopefully my last - data collection by the third week of March. Mind you, this is under my **own** expectation to defend in July. She still thinks I'm going to defend in April. Oops. Shoot, at this point, I'm not even sure I'll be able to defend in July.\n\n\\*\\*Before I get called out for laziness, I had been working a level II engineering job part-time, roughly 25-30 hours/week, since Jan 2021. Heavy project demands and a boss who could fire you the minute they sensed you wanted to lighten your workload DEFINITELY made it really hard to allocate less time to work and more time to my thesis and classes. My contract with them ended exactly when I expected it to (last December) and now I'm subsisting off of 2 years of savings while I put about 20 hours a week into research and another 20-25 hours into my last two classes.\n\nAll that said, how screwed am I? When should I start worrying that I might not even be able to defend in July? Should I just go full speed ahead and start my data collection early and work out the kinks as I move along? Am I investing too much time into my classes? Am I not investing enough time per week into my research?\n\nI know that's a lot of questions, and I'm sure if anyone can relate to my conundrum, it's a good portion of the folks on this subreddit. Please let me know what you all think. Thanks!",

How do you stay disciplined? What unconventional method makes it easier for you to get in the zone to be productive?  \n\n\nThank you in advance!",

Basically when I first went to college I was not the best student I think I had something like a 2.56 after my second year. But, I took two years off and had a real interest in working in museums so I got an internship and my gpa at my upper division school I went to is a 3.89 but because of my first two years at a community college it averages to about a 3.24. I just wanted to know if the Uk and Irish universities would care more about the recent university or would they look at my gpa as a whole. Basically I’m asking if I’m fucked because younger me decided just showing up was good enough.",
