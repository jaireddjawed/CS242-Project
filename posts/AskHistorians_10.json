I looked online for any evidence to substantiate this, but found nothing substantial. So was this a real objective of the SS, or simply a pipe-dream like so many other Nazi projects?",

I've been curious as to why the early twentieth century, mainly 1920s-1940s pop action fiction in America, started having action heroines, i.e., female heroic characters engaging in combat as well physical fights/gun fights. For example, in the 1920s, the first written Buck Rogers story has female soldiers, not to mention plenty of pulp fiction heroines and early comic book superheroines. I'm trying to figure out why did early twentieth-century American writers start writing about these types of characters when nineteenth-century writers rarely, if ever, did, let alone portray these female characters taking on the traditionally \"masculine\" role of heroic combat in a positive manner. What changed in American society or pop culture at this time to instigate the emergence of these types of characters during this time period? Did the emergence of this type of character reflect changing societal views on women and their roles in society? Was there a popular piece of work/works with this type of character that other writers imitated? Any information, theories, or resources would be appreciated.",

        "text": "It’s probably common historical knowledge that the invention of things like the television, the car, and the telephone had nothing to do with America.\n\nbut it’s not just that. America seems to be entirely lacking in innovative spirit for its entire history. Almost every idea to forward humanity in America, actually becomes a lot less respectable. Once you look at more closely\n\nThe film camera and the lightbulb, for instance, are both claimed to be invented by Americans, but in actuality, the patents were either purchased or stolen from French inventors, and Canadians respectively.\n\nA more hopeful story can be found in the transistor, invented by the lab sometime in the late 40s, this is often Harold Ed as the peak of American inventive achievement, but just a couple of years later, a group of French scientists independently invented it themselves, subsequently nullifying whatever impact the original could’ve had, and denying it the label of being a unique American achievement. I’d say the second is actually more impressive than inspiring, given that this was only 10 years after World War II, and France could’ve easily turned itself to American influence, but instead turned around and spat in its face.\n\nThe most embarrassing story is that of the birth control pill, which while Americans were  leading the charge for free, accessible and legal birth control for all (in America at least) around the same time, the birth control was being invented by a company named Syntex- In MEXICO. Mexico! Because America, being the innovative country that it is, no one there had the revolutionary idea to put birth control in a pill! (for clarification, two of the scientists who crafted it were European immigrants while the last was native Mexican) seriously, the difference in visionary ability between the two is pretty ridiculous. One was literally a Third World country.\n\nThe Internet is another story. Everyone knows, America only has a fraction of the credit. Old titans France and Britain actualy took large part in devoloping the fundamentals. The other half of computer use, the WWW of course, was invented 100% by one man in the UK named Tim-Berners-Lee. \n\nHe saw a problem with the world, and used his grit and intellect and free labour to create a solution, and in turn with his creation changed the lives of billions of people. The MOST American story ever told.\n\nThe French even had a precusor to the internet that was the most popular in the world bar none. Wi fi was invented in Australia. The Computer Mouse was invented in Sweden.\n\nBasketball was invented by a Canadian\n\nHip Hop was invented by a Jamaican\n\nThe Tuxedo is British\n\nApple Pie is British\n\nThe interchangeable part is French\n\nThe First Cinemas were French\n\nPineapple on Pizza is Greek-Canadian \n\nModern Sushi is Japanese-Canadian\n\nThe 3-D printer is Japanese\n\nI mean, seriously, how pathetic do you have to be as a nation, when not only all your technology is derivative, but all your fucking ICONOGRAPHY is as well? There is well over 150 MILLION of us, and there has been for a while. How simple minded and uncreative is the average American? Their average IQ is 100 which is just as good as other countries.\n\nand for the things Americans did genuinely invent, mostly on the commercial side (video games, film animation, comics maybe, pop music) they were completely outcompeted, or at the very least equalled by a foreign nation, usually with a much smaller population, sometimes within about 20 years! (Japan, Japan, Japan, Britain, respectively)\n\nAmerican inventions seem to fall largely into four categories\n\nThings that were invented around the same time in other countries making American influence questionable: The Transistor, The Airplane, The smartphone, The Web browser, the nuclear bomb, etc\n\n“Commercial versions” of stuff that already exists: The Lightbulb, The Solar Panel, The Computer, the car, the film\n\ninventions that Americans needed other nations help with: GMOs, The Nuclear bomb, Space Travel, The internet\n\nthings that America took from other countries: endless (method acting, the basis of Hollywood)\n\n\n\nI just don’t get it, why are us Americans such massive disappointments to our older relatives, the Brits, easily the most innovative country in the world for hundreds of years???? who invented the World Wide Web, penicillin, science fiction, the steam engine, literally hundreds of music genres, Science Fiction, and literally kick started a scientific and industrial revolution all on its own??? (seriously, it was the only area in 1800 to be industrialized)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my humble opinion, if those right wing extremists want to point to anything as evidence that the West is in decline, there would be nothing better to point to than the increase in American hegemony itself.",

        "text": "I realise this is frankly a ludicrously broad question given its geographic and temporal scope, but I am not familiar enough with the subject to make the question more specific. The question was triggered by coming across a quote on this sub attributed to Muscogee leader Speckled Snake in the context of the debate on Indian Removal in 1829 (only partial reproduction): \n\n&gt;\"Brothers! I have listened to a great many talks from our great father. But they always begin and ended in this- \"Get a little further, you are too near me.\" Brothers! Our great father says that \"where we are now, our white brothers have always claimed the land.\" He speaks with a straight tongue, and cannot lie. But when he first came over the wide waters, while he was yet small, and stood before the great chief at the council on Yamacraw Bluff, he said \"Give me a little land, which you can spare, and I shall pay you for it.\" Brothers! When our great father made us a talk, on a former occasion, and said, \"Get a little further, go beyond the Oconee, the Ocmulgee; there is a pleasant country,\" he also said \"It shall be yours forever.\"\n\nThe terminology here (assuming the quote represents an actual reproduction) seems based on notions of kinship and seems to suggest that the Muscogee understood the Americans to belong to a shared community of common descent, but at the same time I am very much aware this speech was made with a particular rhetorical intent. Nonetheless, it made me wonder how Native American communities conceived of Americans as a community with a particular political organisation. Given the massive differences in scale in terms of population and resources by the 19th century between the United States as a state versus even the largest Native communities, it seems hard to imagine that such communities would see the former as simply an extremely large kinship network. \n\nThis is not even considering the large variety of social and political traditions between groups sharing little but the label 'Native' assigned to them by white settlers, which must have led to drastically different conceptions of social and political structures. Keeping all that in mind, can there still be any pointers or general introductory statements to give an initial impression of how (some) Native American communities saw the United States?",

I recently discovered that the so-called \"roman salute\" isn't actually roman but came from a portrayal of a painting in the late 1700s. \n\nThe ancient Roman (and Greeks) must have had some sort of acknowledgement or form of respectful greeting for those in higher positions of authority. I found some conflicting sources online that it was either a clenched fist over the heart or an outstretched or some kind of outstretched hand similar to the Roman salute but different. \n\nCould a bowed head or other gesture done in reverence be considered a salute so long as it's consistent and used for the right social contexts. I imagine that there can't be too much variation in possible salutes for that time period and region.",

The mental hospital had performed many horrendous acts and \"experiments\" on the patients which i think probably would have been illegal even at the time if they were discovered. I say this because i know that mental hospitals was not exactly a nice place during these years and some rather strange and inhumane treatments were used. But regardless, i have a few particular questions which i can't find solid answers to. If it helps for context, i wanted to have it that the person \"in charge\" of the hospital was leading many of the experiments carried out and no one beisdes those who were \"high up\"/close to him inside of the hospital had known about what was happening because he never wanted anyone else knowing about what was being done. I wanted to know if this would have ever been possible basically and if it were, i had a couple more questions. \n\nWho owned/was in charge of the hospital and therefore maybe what happened there? \n\nWhat power did the person above have at the institute? (If there was any such person) \n\nWere they checked up on by some sort of higher ups in order to make sure the hospital was treating patients accordingly in order to continue housing patients or were the staff largely just left to do whatever they wanted with the patients?\n\nWould it have been hard to perform any such \"illegal\" acts on any patients without anyone from the outside knowing about it besides those on the inside (say maybe some trusted doctors who were in on the experiments being done)\n\n\n\nIf you can think of anything else of importance i should consider or would happen then please tell me and answer if you can. If you can't tell already, i really have no idea about how old mental hospitals work or are maintained so thank you to anyone who answers :)",

Eye of Sahara\nI mean the claim that they say that Plato talks about atlantis being 3 circles with a water connection to the south and so on is pretty much spot on how the eye of Sahara looks. \n\n\n2. Cataclysmic events.\nThere are indications that both South Pole and Greenland have been struck by huge comets that should've led to almost overnight flooding. Combine this with civilizations living to a high precent on the coast and much is lost. \n\nAlso satellite images shows how landmass still are affected by these (or other) major flooding events. \n\n\n3. Pyramids all over the world.\nThough they are different there are almost to many similarities. One guy meant that the pyramids are so similar the world over in some aspects that it speaks for itself that they had much higher capability of travel and trade than historians claim.\n\n\n4. Many islands that existed are now under water. \nWe know little of these civilizations, right? \n\n5. Africa was a forest, not a desert, it its younger age. Right? Is it impossible that a highly advanced civilizations lived there? \nEye of Sahara maybe being the ruins of one of them? \n\n6. The granite jugs found in Egypt.\nEgyp is a center for many things. The jugs for example that are made of stone almost or harder than steel with a margin of error on the flatness in the top that is so small it is almost not measurable \n\n\nI mean the earth goes through cycles, we know that, is it so impossible that one civilization or several rose during one of these cycles and got extinct through a comet hit? \n\n\nI am sincere when I ask here beacuse media is booming with all these claims, ofc it sells! It is controversial. \nBut is it plain untrue claims?\n\nI have a really hard time sorting all these claims beacuse Internet is overrun these days with these theories that I ask here instead.",

Or is this more of a reasonable *presumption*, that the Mongols, being famous for mounted warriors, likely used them in their attempted subjugation of the Japanese home islands?\n\nThanks so much for any and all answers!",

Was there a large group/groups of Chinese fighting the Japanese in the territory they had conquered? If so what kind of activities did they engage in (espionage, sabotage, outright fighting, etc.) and how much of a hindrance was it to the Japanese?",

What I don't understand is how there ir several witness accounts about the executio and no action was taking further. Am I missing something obvious? The fonts of my research have ommited something obvious? I'm specially weirded that not only british courts, but european courts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm not good at formulating the question itself. so , I'll try again : Am I missing something obvious about the killings itself and/or am I right in my understading that it was an execution and that the juditial powers validated the killings of the soldiers. Furthermore, why the names of those who commited the killings were never released? Security reasons? If they were to be found guilty, would they be released?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you. I'm somewhat new to the theme and having trouble understanding how one sided the pusishment seems to be in the troubles",

They said all previous empires exploit their subjects, and in response, I gave the Roman empire. I then realised I actually don't know that much about it, and just assumed their peripheral nations weren't exploited in the same way Africa, the Americas and part of Asia were. Is colonialism (including Rome's) always this bad? Are there any past occupations/ colonies that weren't treated like second class citizens, and didn't have the raw resources of their land extracted to the detriment of their native populations?
