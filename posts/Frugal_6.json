The Annie's snack company makes \"Graham Sandwich Cookies\" which look essentially the same at $12.99 for a pack of 12! That's like 15x more expensive!\n\nAnd while we're at it, how does such a classic snack not have a better name? Petition to name them after my mom: Marcias.",

        "text": "Tacos rule. \n\nThey're frugal with both money and time. \n\nThey're cheap to make and divide up easy into multiple meals, are reasonably nutritious when made with beans and veggies. \n\nI love the fact that I can just make them with whatever and not worry about measuring anything or being short on ingredients. There's no part of a taco which can't be left out or substituted if needed, excepting a tortilla. \n\nI buy beef in the 1 lb frozen tubes, so they keep individually in the freezer basically forever, then thaw out a day ahead to make tacos... can enhance cheap bulk taco seasoning with some cumin, paprika, ancho, and/or chipotle pepper for extra flavor, and if you make it without fresh veggies and onions, you don't have any prep work at all. Just brown the meat in a skillet with seasonings and heat the beans, sprinkle on some cheese and salsa or hot sauce and you're done. \n\nleftovers go in a tub, make for great burritos later which you can pad out with rice.",

I have been trying to find a way to succeed in 'frugal healthy eating for weight loss while struggling with adhd' for quite some time.\n\nI've been looking for a coach or consultant who could just break down a concept or two into smaller pieces so they feel doable. No one seems to understand what I mean...so...I google and google and google and finally stumble upon this article about batch cooking for beginners.\n\nhttps://www.heynutritionlady.com/batch-cooking-for-a-healthy-week/\n\nI'm skeptical because I batch cook meals already when conditions are ripe...a big pot of stew...prep cut veggies for the week etc \n\nBut I read this article and she says...she SAYS...batch cook your beans, legumes, and grains too. I'm not kidding, this has never occurred to me. Electrical currents of dopamine flow! Hallelujah! Yes! Soak and cook a whole bag of beans, and FREEZE them, and you now have easy batches ready to throw into a stew or stir fry.\n\nAs a result - this weekend I have finally used two bags of great northern beans, a bag of quinoa, and 2 cans of chickpeas that have been languishing in my pantry for a very very long time.\n\nIt's a game changer and I don't know why it never occurred to me before. Frugal win for using things I already have and not wasting, healthy meal win with a chickpea peanut butter curry with quinoa for supper, weight loss win AND ADHD win as I am not eating takeout pizzas once again. AND I don't have to shell out big bucks for a coaching session.\n\nEcstatic. Had to share. Batch cooking for beginners. Who knew???",

I've just been having trouble finding reliable information about it. Lots of news stories, lots of places selling heat pumps, but not a lot of actual useful information.\n\nHas anyone here bought a heat pump with the program? Can you get the rebate if you install yourself, or are you required to get a professional installer? If the rebate comes in tax credit form, do you get it even if you take the standard deduction? Perhaps most importantly, is there somewhere else I should be asking all these questions (lol)? \n\nThanks for any help pointing me in the right direction.",

        "text": "I'm a 33yo woman with my own home that I share with my partner and our 3 kids. My mom has always been a bargain shopper but not in a smart way. She will buy something simpy because it's on clearance, and not because it's something she NEEDS and it happens to be discounted. Lately, she's been spending a couple hundred USD on the Amazon pallets. It's always full of junk and in my opinion it's a huge waste of money. \n\nMy parents just bought a brand new $40k SUV and put $15k down (their life savings, apparently). My dad just turned 65 and wants to retire in 2 years, but now they are worried that they won't be able to afford their new car payment if he does. It's all so super frustrating to hear them complain about money but then spend it all on frivolities. \n\nWhat makes things worse is that we can never just visit with my parents without getting \"things\" from them. I was given some cheaply made yoga leggings that weren't even my size. The joke in my house is that whenever we plan a day to visit my parents we have to schedule a goodwill drop off because that's where everything should just go. \n\nWe are not \"things\" people, and we are very conscious of where our food and clothing comes from. Our purchases are sustainable and we try to support local businesses before buying elsewhere. We have quite a bit saved up for two people in their 30s and we don't want to be put in a position of having to financially care for my parents in the near future simply because they aren't good with money.\n\nI've mentioned this numerous times and it doesn't seem to sink in. Every year for birthdays and Christmas we tell them to make a donation on our behalf or just get us gift cards for groceries, etc. The kids have SO MANY things from them that end up just getting donated or thrown away within a few weeks.\n\nAny advice on how to stop this madness? It's at the point to where we don't want to see them if it means having our car filled up with shit and then hearing how they can't afford for my dad to retire.",

        "text": "Sometimes I see people talking about frugal choices that genuinely puzzle me. You know that there are some choices that take more work to do than they save you money-wise... Right?\n\nan example is the landlord here on the property I live on. He spelled out his plan to get those timers for all the lights in the house so that no light will be on for more than a few minutes... and the same guy is confused when he comes into the space at night and I'm doing things in the mostly dark house without turning on lights, because my eyes are dark adapted. He's convinced himself that the frugal choices is to buy and install a dozen timers in the house lighting, at something like 20$ each, to save maybe 10c a year in LED bulbs power use.\n\nsometime the immediate frugal choice actually changes the situation such that a future choice that could have had a bigger impact is no longer an option.\n\nand sometimes the frugal choice is to spend the money on the thing: for example a world map shower curtain tore through a couple of the holes and no longer hung right. I was about to spend a half hour trimming a bit of material from an area that it wouldn't be noticed, warm up the household iron get some scrap baking parchment a fuse a reinforcemt strip to the top that also closed the tear outs, and use a hole punch to punch the holes for the curtain rings to hang it up again... until my housemate said, \"You could do all that, or spend a dollar at the dollar store for a replacement.\"\n\nFocus your frugal on the choices that get the biggest benefit. The whole 20 percent of the effort in the right areas gets you 80 percent of the return. After that there are points of diminishing returns. And never forget to include the value of your time and energy, lest you you work for an hour to save a nickle, when you could spend a nickle and use the hour in another area that benefits you more.",

We didn’t have a car until I was 10. I remember walking everywhere or taking the bus. My mom raised me as a single mom to the best of her ability but I still didn’t have much growing up. I’m currently 25 and I still find myself not wanting to spend money on things that I don’t consider a necessity. I made very good money last year- over 300k, but I find myself trying to save as much money as possible because I never want to be in the same position that I was in when I was younger. For example- I canceled my 15$/month Netflix subscription because I only watched Netflix once last month and thought it was a waste of money to keep renewing my subscription. I hate buying clothes or new shoes unless I absolutely have to. I feel bad spending an extra 2$ for guacamole at chipotle. In my head, I keep thinking- 2 dollars here, 10 dollars there- eventually all of this adds up. Someone please tell me it’s ok to spend my money.",

I don't make a ton of food with tomato paste so I can't keep it in the fridge (it goes bad pretty quickly), but I hate throwing it away. Now I drop two-tbsp lumps on a plate covered with a sheet of saran wrap or parchment paper, freeze, then store them in a ziplock or plastic container. That takes care of your frugal chilis and spaghetti sauces and you don't need to open a can or clean up.",

You can try to suck the air out with your mouth potentially introducing your bacteria or risking sucking up salmonella yourself. This is not advised.\n\nInstead pack your bags, have a bowl or fill your kitchen sink with water. Dip the bag in the water, forcing air to rise to the top, and seal the bag once the air is 99% gone. \n\nDoing this should help better preserve your foods. Additionally if planning to store things a long time you can add a 1/4 water inside the bag to further try and encourage air pockets to disperse. Venison, fish fillets, veggies. Deep freeze water trick makes thawing take longer though.",

        "text": "This sub often talks about freezing bananas, soup and meat. What are some items that freeze well but don't get mentioned on this sub? Here are mine:\n\n* **Lemon juice:** Fresh lemon juice tastes much better than the bottled stuff, but it doesn't last long. Freeze your lemon juice in ice cube trays. \n\n* **Spices:** Ground spices start to loose flavor after 6 months. Whole spices after 12. After that you might need to use more or replace them. Frozen spices keep their flavor forever. If you buy spices in bulk, freeze most and keep a small jar's worth on hand. \n\n* **Smoothie cubes:** Toss some strawberries in a food processor and freeze in ice cube trays. When you want smoothies, pop a few into a glass and add some other fruit. My preferred recipe adds canned mandarin oranges, maraschino cherries and whatever juice I have on hand.\n\n* **Cheese (for cooking):** Freezing cheese ruins the texture, so it's not great for sandwiches. When melted its perfectly fine though. I use frozen cheese in enchiladas or mixed into chili.",

My boss countless times have screamed at me yelled at me manipulating me hit me I’ve been slapped on the ass by her husband three times once underage. So basically about a month ago I was under the impression that I wasn’t making 14 $15 a hour plus tips Witch all the tips I made but I had to split them with the cook in half, and my boss always took a portion of it even though she made all the money off the sales. But when I asked her for my paystub a month ago she said oh you got that in the mail I said no not my W-2 my paystub. This was the first paystub I’ve saw since I was 14 years old, because I wasn’t on payroll until I was 14. I first opened it up to see I’m only making $13 an hour after working this whole summer taking everyones hours missed out on graduations and family trips but being under the impression I was making 15 since last November 2021. Also when I filled out my W-4 form I put a one and she changed it my boss without my permission to zero I haven’t been able to file my taxes in two years I don’t have to pay in, but I just can’t file them. So basically she got really defensive about the pay stub and she was like I’ll backpay you for all of the pay if you stay, but I couldn’t even stay after being so unappreciated everyday and abused so I just walked out and she has been ignoring me every day even though I helped her build her business. How would you guys go about getting this money back she owes me tip money becuase bosses aren’t supposed to touch the tips, back pay, and tax money for changing it from 1-0. It’s a private owned restraunt with no help. Plzzz comment what you’d do",
