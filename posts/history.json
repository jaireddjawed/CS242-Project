Maybe it is to do with the education system in our countries simplifying it to Versailles being too harsh, and that\u2019s what people believe, but I believe that this idea of the the west destroying Germany after WW1 to be created by the nazi regime in order to rally support agains Britain and France. I also believe that it was not harsh enough as one French general said after the war \u201cThis is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years\u201d - Foch. It can also be said that if Germany was weakened more heavily they could never rose up again, like after ww2. Instead the true cause of Naziism in Germany were the Great Depression in Germany, the country was hit worse than pretty much any other country, 6 million Germans were left jobless and is what caused a major shift in peoples political stance favouring Hitler who proposed the west being the cause for the depression and failures of the Weimar regime from the treaty of Versailles.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1677418073.0},{"title":"What Was the \u201cEpic Cycle\u201d Really?","author":"Magister_Xehanort","url":"https:\/\/talesoftimesforgotten.com\/2023\/02\/04\/what-was-the-epic-cycle-really\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677425333.0},{"title":"Mysterious marks on Ice Age cave art may have been a form of record keeping.","author":"Rifletree","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/mysterious-marks-ice-age-cave-art","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677331596.0},{"title":"Flotsam found off New York may be from famous SS Savannah","author":"egg_static5","url":"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/science-new-york-city-bronx-savannah-oceans-dc09efafd9b191d0715a084516527ed5","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677275558.0},{"title":"Weekly History Questions Thread.","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/11bkh5p\/weekly_history_questions_thread\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our History Questions Thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

His father, Pedro de Magalhaes, was the mayor of Sabrosa. Growing up, Magellan served as a page for Eleanor of Viseu, the queen consort of Portugal, and later in the court of King Manuel I. Magellan first set sail at the age of 25, enlisting in the Seventh India Armada tasked with securing Portuguese naval dominance over the Indian Ocean. Over the next decade, Magellan participated in a number of battles, including the successful conquest of the Malaysian state of Malacca. His military successes led to a major promotion, and he received a significant amount of plunder from the Portuguese navy's conquests.\n\n>Around 1514, however, Magellan fell out of favor with Manuel I after taking a leave of absence without permission. Around this time, Magellan devoted his efforts to investigating a westward route to the Indian Ocean, avoiding the need to sail around the Southern tip of Africa. Given his personal and professional falling-out with Manuel I, Magellan approached Charles I of Spain to finance his trip. Charles I agreed, and on September 20, 1519, five ships with a total combined crew of 270 men set out from Spain with about two years worth of supplies.\n\n>The route from Spain to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was well charted, and the fleet arrived there without incident by December. The fleet proceeded to sail along the coast hoping to discover a route through or around the continent. Magellan thought he had found such a route in the estuary of the Rio de la Plata, but the attempt proved fruitless and costly. By April, the increasingly cold weather forced the fleet to wait out the next few months at Puerto San Julian, which was, in fact, only a three-day sail from the gateway to the Pacific, though Magellan could not have known that. Shortly after their arrival in St. Julian, some of the Spanish captains declared a mutiny. Magellan nearly lost control of the fleet, in the end, barely fending off the mutineers. He sentenced one of its leaders to death, another to being marooned, and lower-level conspirators to hard labor. During a storm that winter, one of the ships, the Santiago, was lost. All the men aboard escaped before it sunk.\n\n>In October, three days after resuming the voyage, the fleet discovered what would later be known as the Strait of Magellan, a narrow sea-route separating the South American mainland from the Tierra del Fuego archipelago and connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Around this time, another of the ships, the San Antonio, turned around and deserted the fleet, arriving back in Spain six months later.\n\n>With no conception of the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, Magellan expected to reach Asia in as little as three days. Instead, it would be three months and twenty days before they saw land again, finally reaching Guam in March of 1521. During the journey, the fleet consumed most of its food and water and at least thirty men died of scurvy. Exhausted by the journey, the crew lacked the energy to fight off the local Chamarro people who raided the ships of supplies. After regrouping, Magellan ordered his men to burn down the thieves' houses, slaughter many of them, and recover their supplies.\n\n\n\n>Ten days later, the fleet landed in the Philippines. Over the next month, Magellan befriended community leaders and sought to convert the locals to Christianity, planting crosses and holding Mass. When the people on the island of Mactan resisted these efforts, Magellan sought to subdue them with a show of military force. However, many of the people on Mactan were fierce warriors who easily overpowered Magellan's men, killing Magellan himself.\n\n>After Magellan's death, the crew selected Duarte Barbosa and Juan Serrano to lead the voyage. While Magellan's personal slave and translator, Enrique, was to be freed upon his master's death, Barbosa and Serrano forced him to continue as their slave. Furious, Enrique colluded with a local chieftain to plan the massacre of around thirty officers, including Barbosa and Serrano. While Serrano was initially kept alive and held for ransom, Joao Carvalho\u2014the new first-in-command\u2014abandoned Serrano. The scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who sailed with the crew in order to chronicle the journey, suggests in his account that Carvalho did so to remain in command.\n\n>At this point, only 115 men remained which wasn't enough to pilot three ships. Abandoning the Concepcion, the fleet sailed off in the Trinidad and the Victoria in search of the Molucca Islands in present-day Indonesia. It took them six months to find, during which time the fleet engaged in numerous acts of piracy, mostly against small Chinese junk boats. The fleet finally reached the Moluccas in November before setting out back to Spain in December. However, with the Trinidad in a sorry state of disrepair, it was decided that only the Victoria would head home via the Indian Ocean while the Trinidad would attempt to return across the Pacific Ocean. A few weeks later, the Trinidad was captured by the Portuguese navy and later shipwrecked.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676840100.0},{"title":"Antics and Quackery during Ireland's Easter Rebellion","author":"spark8000","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/QyKYP89ECXY","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676818913.0},{"title":"Discovery of 4,500-year-old palace in Iraq may hold key to ancient civilisation | Archaeology","author":"JesseBricks","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/feb\/17\/discovery-of-4500-year-old-palace-in-iraq-may-hold-key-to-ancient-civilisation","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676661445.0},{"title":"Weekly History Questions Thread.","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/115esr4\/weekly_history_questions_thread\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our History Questions Thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

Of course, I think the Party Switch complicates my understanding of politics then to now. I am also further confused by the presence of Progressives in both parties (so if you could touch on a contrast between Roosevelt and Wilson that would be helpful).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently reading August Hecksher's biography on Wilson. He details Wilson's approach to monopolies (when campaigning for his first election) as wanting to first destroy monopolies, put everyone on even grounds and then enable free competition through tariff reform, FTC and banking reform. The idea being create an even ground, then you wouldn't have to do much, the Invisible Hand will take care of the rest.\n\nThis contrasts to how Heskcher details Roosevelt's policy on monopolies, in which Roosevelt wanted to constantly monitor monopolies and become an active participant when there were *bad* monopolies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWilson argued that this approach created too much government involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, I am currently watching Biographic's Youtube Video on Calvin Coolidge. He states Coolidge to be a staunch conservative, wanting as little government intervension as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- This seems to contrast with the distinction between Roosevelt and Wilson's monopoly policies? It seems that Roosevelt's policy would have increased government intervention. This is important to my understanding, I believe, because they are both Republican's in the early 20th century.\n\n\\- I also understood Wilson to be very much a classical liberalist, so it would seem he would have agreed with Coolidge's desire to lessen government intervention?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate anymore color that can be drawn on the differences between Republicans\/Democrats in the early 1900s (for example the comparison of Taft and Roosevelt, Roosevelt v. Wilson, Wilson v. Champ Clark, Taft v. Wilson) that help me understand the ideological differences, esp. w\/ regards to Progressivism during the period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/WOODROW-WILSON-August-Heckscher\/dp\/0684193124](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/WOODROW-WILSON-August-Heckscher\/dp\/0684193124)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EzMqH5fUtko](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EzMqH5fUtko)","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1676496682.0},{"title":"How different were the Italians and the Romans in the social war?","author":"hhhhhab","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/112yqrt\/how_different_were_the_italians_and_the_romans_in\/","text":"At the start of the war, how different were the Italian tribes compared to the Romans?

But no film or recording exists of it. With the help of historians, researchers in ethics, and artificial intelligence, our team pieced together de Gaulle\u2019s famous appeal of June 18, 1940 and reconstructed it in his voice. You can watch the video [here](https:\/\/www.lemonde.fr\/en\/videos\/video\/2023\/01\/19\/how-le-monde-recreated-de-gaulle-s-lost-1940-call-for-france-to-resist_6012188_108.html). I have directed Le Monde\u2019s video department for three years, supervising high-impact visual investigations on subjects from Uyghur internment camps to Wagner mercenaries in Africa. Before joining Le Monde, I produced award-winning short documentaries about past and current wars for European media like Arte and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. I discovered the fascinating story of De Gaulle\u2019s lost speech ten years ago, while doing my post-graduate degree at Cardiff University.

Apparently their goal was to lessen Chinese resolve \nthrough terror. Tens of thousands of women were not only raped but also, typically, mutilated and killed. Men were frequently forced to rape members of \ntheir own families. \"Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs, \nand the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were \npracticed, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying \npeople to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds.\"<sup>50<\/sup> \nThe behavior of the Japanese was so atrocious that a Nazi living in Nanking at \nthe time described the massacre as the operation of \"bestial machinery.\"<sup>51<\/sup>  \nUnlike the Germans, the Japanese have yet to come fully to grips with responsibility for the acts of their army in 1937, and those Japanese veterans who have \nfaced up to their behavior and asked forgiveness have been targets of hate and \nviolence from right-wing groups in Japan. \n\n>Journalist Iris Chang, who wrote the \ndefinitive work on the rape of Nanking, placed the blame for the genocidal \nactions of the Japanese army on indoctrination by \"a dangerous government, in \na vulnerable culture, in dangerous times, able to sell dangerous rationalizations \nto those whose human instincts told them otherwise.\"<sup>53<\/sup> She believed, as have \nmany others, that the behavior of the Japanese troops traced in part to the brutality, often in the form of severe physical abuse, that the Japanese army of the \ntime inflicted on its own soldiers and officers.<sup>54<\/sup> When turned loose on helpless \ncivilians whom soldiers had been indoctrinated to believe were lower than pigs \nand ordered to massacre them, Chang wrote, it \"is easy to see how years of suppressed anger, hatred, and fear of authority could have erupted in uncontrollable violence at Nanking.\"<sup>55<\/sup> Such behavior does not seem so hard to explain \nwhen people (the teachers) in a known experimental environment, subject to no \nabuse, indoctrination, or coercion and under no obligation to authorities, could \nbe led to inflict punishment that might (in their minds) lead to the deaths of colleagues in an experiment. \n\nPaul Ralph Ehrlich. *Human Natures\nGenes, Cultures, and the Human Prospect* (2000).

Japanese troops wrote, during the Manchuria occupation and beforehand, that the Chinese were 'lower than pigs' and a 'completely inferior people'(4). In this light, it wasn't hard to see why the Japanese would have developed an outlook which completely dehumanized the Chinese. For example, Unit 731 referred to the prisoners as maruta, which is Japanese for 'log of wood'.

It was a mobile edit done nearly four years ago. I guess this goes to show why you never rely on Wikipedia. No original research, and a big thing at the top of the page if you rely too much on primary sources...\n\nI don't know how anyone could read [*Plain Facts For Old And Young*](https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/19924\/19924-h\/19924-h.htm) and not get it. He literally says there's quacks who exaggerate the effects of masturbation to scare boys and young men, then goes on to write an obviously satirical section in ***A Chapter for Boys***.\n\nIn that chapter he literally writes. \n\n>Closing Advice to Boys and Young Men.\u2014One word more and we must close this chapter, which we hope has been read with care by those for whom it is especially written. Let every boy who peruses these pages remember that the facts here stated are true.\n\nAnd before that wrote. \n\n>What Makes Boys Dwarfs.\u2014How many times have we seen boys who were born with good constitutions, with force and stamina sufficient to develop them into large, vigorous men, become puny dwarfs. \n\n>What Makes Idiots.\u2014Reader, have you ever seen an idiot?

It is by this very vice that the ranks of these poor daft mortals are being recruited every day.\n\n---\n\n[From wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Harvey_Kellogg)\n\n\n>He circumcised himself at age 37. His methods for the \"rehabilitation\" of masturbation addicts included measures up to the point of cutting off part of the genitals, without anesthetic, on both sexes; he wrote men who did should be circumcised and women that did should have carbolic acid applied to their clitoral glans.[46] In his Plain Facts for Old and Young, he wrote:[46]\n\nThe larger piece  [*Plain Facts For Old And Young*](https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/19924\/19924-h\/19924-h.htm).\n\nFrankly, it reads like a satire. The section Wikipedia uses to say that he recommended circumcision seems to be a joke when looking at it in context of the whole text. \n\n>A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed.[58]\n\nEvidence that this is a joke. \n\n\n\n># ANATOMY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.\n\n> Circumcision.\u2014The fold of integument called the prepuce, which has been previously described, has upon its inner surface a large number of glands which produce a peculiar secretion. Under certain circumstances, and from inattention to personal cleanliness, this secretion may accumulate, and then often becomes the cause of irritation and serious disease. To prevent such disorders, and to insure cleanliness, the Jewish law required the removal of the prepuce, which constituted the rite of circumcision. The same practice is followed by several modern nations dwelling in tropical climates; and it can scarcely be doubted that it is a very salutary one, and has contributed very materially to the maintenance of that proverbial national health for which the Jews are celebrated. Eminent physicians have expressed the opinion that the practice would be a salutary one for all men. The maintenance of scrupulous cleanliness, by daily cleansing, is at least an imperative duty.\n\n> In some countries, females are also circumcised by removal of the nymph\u00e6. The object is the same as that of circumcision in the male. The same evils result from inattention to local cleanliness, and the same measure of prevention, daily cleansing, is necessitated by a similar secretion. Local cleanliness is greatly neglected by both sexes. Daily washing should begin with infancy and continue through life, and will prevent much disease.\n\n\n\n...\n\n># CURATIVE TREATMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF SELF-ABUSE.\n\n>Circumcision.\u2014In cases of phimosis, in which irritation is produced by retained secretions, division of the prepuce, or circumcision, is the proper remedy. These cases are not infrequent, but the exciting cause of much of the difficulty is often overlooked. The same remedy is often useful in cases of long prepuce.\n\n>When the glans penis is unusually tender and sensitive, this condition will usually be removed by the daily washing with soap and water necessary for cleanliness. If this does not suffice, or if there are slight excoriations caused by acrid secretions, apply, in addition, a weak solution of tannin in glycerine once a day.\n\n...\n\n>Varicocele.\u2014Patients suffering from this difficulty should wear a proper suspensory bag, as the continued pressure of the distended veins upon the testes, if unsupported, will ultimately cause degenerative changes and atrophy. A surgical operation, consisting of the removal of a portion of the skin of the scrotum, is proper if the patient desires an operation; no other operation is advisable.\n\n>The wearing of a suspensory bag is also advisable for those whose testicles are unusually pendulous.\n\n\n\n...\n\n> # Quacks\n\n>Another trap set is called an \"Anatomical Museum.\" The anatomical part of the exhibition consists chiefly of models and figures calculated to excite the passions to the highest pitch. ***At stated intervals the proprietor, who is always a \"doctor,\" and by preference a German, delivers lectures on the effects of masturbation, in which he resorts to every device to excite the fears and exaggerate the symptoms of his hearers***, who are mostly young men and boys. Thus he prepares his victim, and when he once gets him within his clutches, he does not let him go until he has robbed him of his last dollar.\n\n> We might present almost any number of illustrations of the ways in which these human sharks pursue their villainy. If there were a dungeon deep, dark, and dismal enough for the punishment of such rascals, we should feel strongly inclined to petition to have them incarcerated in it. They defy all laws, civil as well as moral, but are cunning enough to keep outside of prison bars; and thus they wax rich by robbery, and thrive by deceit. A terrible recompense awaits them at the final settlement, though they escape so easily now.\n\nTo me, this reads like a lampoon on the whole idea of masturbation causing disease, with allusions to the problems of VD in a time before antibiotics. It sounds like he's talking about how ridiculous it would be to circumcise someone to prevent a disease induced by masturbation. For example, with a varicocele, he offers the idea of a surgery to fix it, but then offers a suspensory bag as a soluton. Likewise, with phimosis and long foreskin, he he offers the idea of circumcision, then says washing daily is fine. He then goes on to state that there are quacks that deliver lectures exaggerating the effects of masturbation so that they can sell some sort of cure. \n\nWhat do you think? I can't find the evidence he circumcised himself.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1674961131.0},{"title":"Ancient statue of Hercules emerges from Rome sewerage repairs","author":"Rob-Study-8562","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jan\/27\/ancient-statue-of-hercules-emerges-from-rome-sewerage-repairs","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674848070.0},{"title":"Can someone explain to me why exactly Wu Tzu Hsu (6c.

I\u2019ve been studying this period out of pure interest. I have no scholar study or anything like that which is probably required to really understand the events. I also have no prior knowledge on Chinese names so admittedly it can be confusing keeping track of who\u2019s who haha. \n\nIf I\u2019m understanding the text correctly, Wu Tzu Shu had an assassination attempt the first time (by the Ch\u2019u?) but merely escaped thanks to a ferry man who had recognized him- but didn\u2019t want to cash in on the reward (of capturing him). I take it once he was back in Wu, there was discussion to attack Ch\u2019u but both the King and Prince feared his desire to attack was out of revenge for his father\/brothers executions at Ch\u2019u hands. They waited until King P\u2019ing died to attack Ch\u2019u 5 years later and then I take it several wars happens through the years proceeding. I take it during one of these battles years later is when Wu invaded Ch\u2019u capital, Wu Tzu Shu dug up the now dead kings body (the king who executed his father and brother) and proceeded to mangle the corpse, which everyone viewed as a disgrace, especially considering he once served said Ch\u2019u king. Years later after Fu-Ch\u2019ai became king, he made peace with Y\u00fceh instead of assassinating him like Wu Tzu Hsu recommended, out of fear they wouldn\u2019t get the chance again. He also suggested not to go to war years later, which did in fact end up being a victory however. Wu Tzu Hsu realizing Wu is doomed for not heeding his word, he tells his son to flee Wu. I take it P\u2019i had issues with Wu Tzu Hsu and would slander him to the king and named off multiple reasons why he should be removed from the party out of fear he would cause them misfortune. The king later saying he was suspicious even prior to P\u2019i warnings. \n\nProbably a terrible summary haha, but is that essentially why he was executed? Because they found success without his advice which led to the assumptions that his suggestions were therefore \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201ccould have\u201d led the Wu to defeat, along side the fear that he was making decisions based on his own desire for revenge for his family and not in the best interest of Wu (attacking the kings dead corpse being what ultimately did him in?). His head was dumped in the river, and civilians erected a status and renamed the river in honor of him so he must of been generally liked. I guess about 9 years late the Wu would finally fall. So he wasn\u2019t entirely wrong?\n\nAgain, I have no prior knowledge at all so I may not 100% be understanding the text correctly.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1674938663.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/10neik9\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

Don't know where that article I read is, anymore... so I was hoping someone more knowledgeable might be able to help me understand the early development of iron.\n\nFor example, one argument that was made, was that when iron smelting becomes possible... why wouldn't it rapidly replace bronze? Iron is more abundant and better than bronze, it seems. So that always confused me with evidence of iron smelting possibly a thousand years before iron became common. Was it a very flawed iron smelting, which improved over time?","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1674735424.0},{"title":"Mysterious handprint found in 1,000-year-old Jerusalem defensive moat","author":"laanalech90","url":"https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/mysterious-handprint-found-in-1000-year-old-jerusalem-defensive-moat\/amp\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1674718732.0},{"title":"A firefighter's 1943 photos of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising have been found","author":"Geek-Haven888","url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2023\/01\/21\/1150586336\/warsaw-ghetto-uprising-1943-photos-found","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674605591.0},{"title":"Russian political parties after Feb 1917?","author":"drain_clerk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/10l6vbr\/russian_political_parties_after_feb_1917\/","text":"I'm about 140 pages into Trotsky's history of the Russian Revolution, and I find it very confusing to figure out exactly who the big players are.

Now it seems to me that Artemis can do whatever she wants, yet it is not true that a man became a deer or a deer a man. It is the poets who have made up such myths, so that people who hear them will not commit outrageous acts against divinity.  \n>  \n>The truth is as follows. Actaeon was an Arcadian who was especially fond of hunting. He always kept a large pack of dogs and hunted with them in the mountains, disregarding his own affairs. Now all the people of those days were dependent on their own labor. They had no servants to do their work, and whoever was the most industrious became the wealthiest. But in the case of Actaeon, his preference for hunting and his lack of attention to his own circumstances causes his livelihood to waste away. When he no longer had anything left, people said: \"Alas for Actaeon, who has been devoted by his own hunting dogs.\" So even today, if a man is unlucky enough to waste his fortune on prostitutes, we are in the habit of saying that he has been \"devoured by whores.\" And this is what happened in the case of Actaeon.  \n>  \n>(Palaephatus 1996, 30)\n\nSocrates also makes reference to such efforts

north wind, pushed her off the neighboring rocks as she was playing with Pharmacea, and \\[229d\\] that when she had died in this manner she was said to have been carried off by Boreas. But I, Phaedrus, think such explanations are very pretty in general, but are the inventions of a very clever and laborious and not altogether enviable man, for no other reason than because after this he must explain the forms of the Centaurs, and then that of the Chimaera, and there presses in upon him a whole crowd of such creatures, Gorgons and Pegas, and multitudes \\[229e\\] of strange, inconceivable, portentous natures. If anyone disbelieves in these, and with a rustic sort of wisdom, undertakes to explain each in accordance with probability, he will need a great deal of leisure. But I have no leisure for them at all; and the reason, my friend, is this: I am not yet able, as the Delphic inscription has it, to know myself; so it seems to me ridiculous,  \n>  \n>(Plato 1925, \u201cPlat. Phaedrus 229.\u201d)\n\nNow, many defenders of the paranormal, or of the efficacy of magic, argue that magic fails to work when it is seen by certain people, like a skeptic. For example, the occultist Isaac Bonewits says that there is \"Catapsi\", a kind of psychic \" 'static' that cancels out regular psi powers within its range\" (Bonewits 1989, 55).\n\nI was wondering if there was an analogous belief or statement in the ancient world. Did anyone in the ancient world believe that observation by human mortals disrupted any sort of magical or paranormal operation?\n\nPersonally, I think I have found one example, from the *Hymn to Demeter.* In this episode, the goddess Demeter tries to bestow immortality upon the young Demophoon via some sort of secret ritual. However, the ritual was viewed by the handmaid Metaneira. Metaneira saw the ritual, and screamed, disrupting the ritual and preventing Demophoon from achieving immortality.\n\n>\u1f63\u03c2 \u1f04\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1

took the child in her fragrant bosom with her divine hands: and his mother was glad in her heart. So the goddess nursed in the palace Demophoon, wise Celeus' goodly son whom well-girded Metaneira bare. \\[235\\] And the child grew like some immortal being, not fed with food nor nourished at the breast: for by day \\[236a\\] rich-crowned Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of a god and breathe sweetly upon him as she held him in her bosom. But at night she would hide him like a brand in the heart of the fire, \\[240\\] unknown to his dear parents. And it wrought great wonder in these that he grew beyond his age; for he was like the gods face to face. And she would have made him deathless and unageing, had not well-girded Metaneira in her heedlessness kept watch by night from her sweet-smelling chamber and \\[245\\] spied. But she wailed and smote her two hips, because she feared for her son and was greatly distraught in her heart; so she lamented and uttered winged words:  \n>  \n>\u201cDemophoon, my son, the strange woman buries you deep in fire and works grief and bitter sorrow for me.\u201d  \n>  \n>\\[250\\] Thus she spoke, mourning. And the bright goddess, lovely-crowned Demeter, heard her, and was wroth with her. So with her divine hands she snatched from the fire the dear son whom Metaneira had born unhoped-for in the palace, and cast him from her to the ground; for she was terribly angry in her heart. \\[255\\] Forthwith she said to well-girded Metaneira:  \n>  \n>\u201cWitless are you mortals and dull to foresee your lot, whether of good or evil, that comes upon you. For now in your heedlessness\\[\\[\u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9\\]\\] you have wrought folly past healing; for \u2014be witness the oath of the gods, the relentless water of Styx \u2014 \\[260\\] I would have made your dear son deathless and unaging all his days and would have bestowed on him everlasting honor, but now he can in no way escape death and the fates. Yet shall unfailing honor always rest upon him, because he lay upon my knees and slept in my arms. \\[265\\] But, as the years move round and when he is in his prime, the sons of the Eleusinians shall ever wage war and dread strife with one another continually. Lo! I am that Demeter who has share of honor and is the greatest help and cause of joy to the undying gods and mortal men. \\[270\\] But now, let all the people build me a great temple and an altar below it and beneath the city and its sheer wall upon a rising hillock above Callichorus. And I myself will teach my rites, that hereafter you may reverently perform them and so win the favour of my heart.\u201d  \n>  \n>(Anon 1914, \"HH 2.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any other examples.

This marriage is typically performed in order to free the raped woman from the dishonor of having lost her virginity while unmarried. The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that, within this system, the act of rape is not formally considered a criminal act in itself, nor is it seriously considered a personal violation of the woman\u2019s bodily autonomy. Rather, the rape is more so considered a violation of the social morality of the society; it is a public dishonor upon the raped woman and her family.\n\nI first learned about the basic concept of rehabilitating marriage from the Bible. It appeared to have been practiced in ancient Israel, according to Deuteronomy 22:28-29 --\n\n>If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days.\n\nFurthermore, it is established elsewhere in the same chapter that a rapist is only given a true punishment -- by execution -- if his victim is a married woman.  \n\nI would surmise that this practice was not unique to the Israelites but was a relatively common practice of the ancient Near East. As I understand, rehabilitating marriage is still practiced even today in some countries, primarily in parts of the Middle  East and Africa. Rehabilitating marriage also appears to be closely connected to the arranged marriage system, in which a young woman\u2019s virginity is highly prized in society, and her relationships and sexuality are as much the business of her family and community as they are the business of herself and her mate.\n\nRehabilitating marriage would seem like a very foreign concept to the sensibilities of a modern person in the West. A woman\u2019s sexual purity and honor are considered of far less importance than her personal dignity and bodily autonomy. Rape in the modern West is commonly considered a heinous crime in and of itself, and is often considered comparable to murder in severity, and in court is often sentenced accordingly with a similar punishment.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know if this has always been the case in the Western world, such as in Europe and North  America. I recently saw a movie called *The Last Duel*. The story takes place in Europe in the Middle Ages, and a married woman is raped by another man who is a rival of her husband. During the course of the story, it is acknowledged that the rape was not really considered a crime against the woman so much as it was a crime against her husband\u2019s honor. Hence, one might speculate that if the woman had been a maiden at the time of her rape, she may have been encouraged into a rehabilitating marriage with the rapist. Recently, I was surprised to learn that rehabilitating marriage has been practiced in Europe as recently as the 20th century. In 1965, an unmarried woman from Sicily named Franca Viola was raped by a man named Filippo Melodia. Afterwards, Franca was expected to engage in rehabilitating marriage to Filippo, as per the norm of Sicilian society at the time. However, Franca made the revolutionary choice to refuse the marriage. Rehabilitating marriage \u2013 the practice of restoring a raped woman\u2019s honor and\/or expunging a rapist\u2019s criminal record through marriage \u2013 was not abolished in Sicily until 1981.\n\nI have a lot of questions about this custom, and feel free to answer any that you please:\n\n* At what point in the history of the West was the act of rape against a woman considered an evil in and of itself, regardless of the woman\u2019s marital or social status?\n* Besides Sicily, are there other examples of countries in Europe which practiced rehabilitating marriage?\n* Was this custom ever practiced in North America, from the colonial period to today?\n* Inasmuch as rehabilitating marriage has been practiced in the West, what are the societal dynamics that led to its general abolishment in the West?\n* Is rehabilitating marriage only a feature of arranged marriage and its corresponding culture, or has it existed even outside of cultures which practiced arranged marriage?\n* Inasmuch as rehabilitating marriage has been practiced in Europe or North America, does its practice come from the Bible and Judeo-Christian tradition, or was it practiced for separate reasons?\n* A modern family in the West would take issue with their loved one getting married to the moral degenerate who raped her; how did Western families who practiced rehabilitating marriage justify this arrangement?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1673949927.0},{"title":"America's First Muslims Were Slaves","author":"Breab1","url":"https:\/\/www.voanews.com\/a\/america-s-first-muslims-were-slaves\/4763323.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1673942891.0},{"title":"Egyptian authorities unveil ancient tomb in Luxor dating back around 3,500 years that archaeologists believe holds the remains of an 18th dynasty royal","author":"MeatballDom","url":"https:\/\/www.arabnews.com\/node\/2232406\/middle-east","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673854730.0},{"title":"Ike and Truman's Strained and Tumultuous Relationship on Inauguration Day, 1953","author":"tom2091","url":"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/eise\/blogs\/ike-and-trumans-strained-and-tumultuous-relationship-on-inauguration-day-1953.htm","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673896117.0},{"title":"\u2018When something like this comes up where we\u2019re both excited, but also that sorrowful that we lost so much.\u2019 \u2014 A M\u0101ori tribe in New Zealand is calling for the return of treasured artefacts listed for sale by the auction house Sotheby\u2019s","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jan\/12\/maori-tribe-sothebys-relics-auction-new-zealand","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673672743.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/10bnvrk\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

They spoke in the beginning, but after Heraclius they started to speak Greek which really cannot be a Roman Empire. Romans and Greeks are totally different things. The culture wasn\u2019t even near Roman culture. Yes the problem was the middle ages by themselves, but paintings, monuments and overall culture are nowhere close to what the Romans had. Another big thing is they were always in some sort of a fight with the West. Whether it is the religion or even politics, they never shared the same opinion as the West, and while that is ok and fair, where is the respect towards the ever lasting Roman empire from the western states? We are always thought that the West wanted to bring back the Roman empire and they missed it a lot, but how can you say that and think about invading or destroying the Eastern part of it? For me, it really looks like that the people of that age didn\u2019t really think that the Eastern Roman empire was even Roman, otherwise I think they would have given it a bit more respect. \nThe religion aswell differed, and Constantinopole always wanted to be one step ahead of Rome, which I think really puts a nail in the coffin in terms of why Eastern Roman Empire during the Middle Ages cannot be fully roman. They always were an outsiders to the Westerners, and I think throughout centuries they just lost their authority over the western part of the Europe in terms of being the real descedents of Rome, hence why we see two times where a new Roman Empire was formed (Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire). I think people from those times even knew that the Byzantines are different from them and wanted to correct that by trying to establish a new Rome on the West. After the 11th century, almost every western state was against the Byzantines and tried on multiple occassions to conquer it. Even the pope itself during the reign of Michael VIII issued an ultimatum againts the Byzantines, where if they don\u2019t accept Catholicism they were going to be attacked. And of course, the really last nail in the coffin from the westerners was the year 1204. How can you even do something like that to the \u201cdescedent\u201d of Rome? For me, that really shows that the medieval people had no thoughts about Byzantines being the Romans and the true descedents of Rome, so yeah, I think the term Byzantines is justified and should be used when talking about the Eastern Roman Empire because they weren\u2019t Romans in the slightest way, they lost eveything Roman possibly already in the 7th century CE.","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1673705139.0},{"title":"New archival findings on the earliest ownership of the Voynich Manuscript","author":"stegu2","url":"https:\/\/www.theartnewspaper.com\/2023\/01\/13\/unknown-history-of-600-year-old-coded-voynich-manuscript-revealed-by-researcher","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673649476.0},{"title":"Discovery of a temple of Poseidon located at the Kleidi site near Samikon in Greece","author":"MeatballDom","url":"https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2023-01-discovery-temple-poseidon-kleidi-site.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673568836.0},{"title":"Conservation of Spanish Armada invasion maps reveals red ink details were added hundreds of years later","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/www.theartnewspaper.com\/2023\/01\/10\/conservation-of-spanish-armada-invasion-maps-reveals-red-ink-details-were-added-hundreds-of-years-later","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673598332.0},{"title":"Betsy Heard, the Mixed Race Woman Who Dominated the West African Slave Trade in the 18th Century","author":"Vailhem","url":"https:\/\/talkafricana.com\/betsy-heard-female-slave-trader-18th-century\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1673572794.0},{"title":"What was the State of Arabic Language Literature in the Ottoman Empire?","author":"McGillis_is_a_Char","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/10a3uri\/what_was_the_state_of_arabic_language_literature\/","text":"In the introduction to \"Desert Songs of the Night\" Edited by Suheil Bushrui & James M Malarkey the editors state that under the Ottomans, \"...

That this reason is that Hitler didn't want a repeat of 1918 when the Home front essentially threw a revolution due to starvation and collapsing economic conditions, ruining the military effort on the front to win. \n\nBut some contradictions come out to me as I do further research. The Nazi led economy as early as 1933 was predominantly focused on rearmament. In fact, any economic growth and prosperity during the \"Golden Years\" is usually attributed to this massive rearmament drive. So in peacetime the German economy is already on a heavy war footing. This was also an intentional plan by Hitler to build up his forces before general war broke out.\n\nFurther, the German economy invested heavily into synthetic resource production to supply resources for the military effort, and as far I can tell, most crucial resources were rationed just like in Allied war economies. Finally, the Wehrmacht was told to and literally exploited ruthlessly the economy of occupied countries to sustain itself and send resources back home.\n\nMy question then, is how do these two narratives coexist? How can one say Germany did not embrace a war economy when it seems it clearly did, years before war even started in fact; while the oft accepted claim of Hitler not embracing total war economic measures also exists and is cited as one of the reasons Germany was doomed to fail.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1673572106.0},{"title":"Were muslim armies harder to maintain in the field?","author":"DJacobAP","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/109i328\/were_muslim_armies_harder_to_maintain_in_the_field\/","text":"I am currently reading Thomas Asbridge's Creation of the Principality of Antioch and while writing about the inability of Il Ghazi to capitalise on his victory at the Field of Blood, he mentions mentions that muslim armies were notoriously hard to maintain in the field, especially during sieges.

(\u8863 = clothing; \u98df = food, water, air; \u4f4f = shelter; \u884c=transport) At that age, I was wondering why it was \"clothing\" that started first, and not food.\n\nAs it turns out, \u98df\u8863\u4f4f is used by Japanese. However, it seems that the term (according to Chinese article) is originated from Chinese, except that Japanese doesn't see \u884c as a basic need (considering the train network, I disagree). Nonetheless, the earliest record that I managed to find \u8863\u98df\u4f4f\u884c is from Sun Yet-San's \"Three Principle of the People\", Section \"Livelihood\", Third talk. I am writing it out the relevant passage in Chinese, and do some translation myself:\n\n>\u5403\u98ef\u5c31\u662f\u6c11\u751f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u9700\u8981\u3002\u6c11\u751f\u7684\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u5f9e\u524d\u7d93\u6fdf\u5b78\u5bb6\u90fd\u662f\u8aaa**\u8863\u3001\u98df\u3001\u4f4f**\u4e09\u7a2e\uff1b\u7167\u6211\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u61c9\u8a72\u6709\u56db\u7a2e\uff0c\u65bc\u8863\u98df\u4f4f\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u9084\u6709\u4e00\u7a2e\u5c31\u662f\u884c\u3002\u884c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f88\u91cd\u7684\u9700\u8981\uff1b\u884c\u5c31\u662f\u8d70\u8def\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u6c11\u751f\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f46\u662f\u8981\u628a\u9019\u56db\u7a2e\u9700\u8981\u5f04\u5230\u5f88\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8981\u5168\u570b\u7684\u4eba\u6c11\u90fd\u80fd\u5920\u4eab\u53d7... \u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u80fd\u5404\u76e1\u5404\u7684\u7fa9\u52d9\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97**\u8863\u98df\u4f4f\u884c**\u7684\u56db\u7a2e\u9700\u8981\u3002  \n>  \n>Eating is the primary need of people's Livelihood. Regarding Livelihood, the prior economists claim it's three needs: **clothing, food, and shelter**. Based on my research, there should be four kinds: Aside from clothing, food and shelter, there is \"xing\". \"xing\" is also an important need; \"xing\" is roads. For us to resolve the issue of livelihood, not only do we need to make this four needs inexpensive, it also needs to be enjoyed by every citizens... if everyone do their duty, everyone can get the four basic needs of **clothing, food, shelter, and transportation**\n\nObviously I am cutting out a bit from the [original talk](https:\/\/zh.wikisource.org\/wiki\/%E4%B8%89%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9\/%E6%B0%91%E7%94%9F%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E8%AC%9B), so I want to emphasize on a few things\n\n1. The Third talk's focus is about Food.\n2. He explained that \"Eat\" include \"wind\" (air), water, and food in general.\n3. In this talk, his focus on transportation is about transportation of food as part of the solution to allivate hunger.\n\nIn any case, there is a few questions that is not truly answered for me, due to either unable to find it, or knowing how some of these articles are biased, not trustworthy. So I am asking everyone's opinion\n\n1. Whether the order \u8863\u98df\u4f4f\u884c truly imply the importance of \"clothing\" over \"food\"?\n\nOf the chinese article I found, the reason listed are:\n\na) classism (appearance to distint themselves from lower class)\n\nb) a symbol of civilization ( from Song's \"\u5468\u6613\u6b63\u7fa9 - I Ching Commentary\": \u5782**\u8863\u88f3**\u800c\u5929\u4e0b\u6cbb - \"By the clothings the Yellow emperor govern the world\"), and since anicent chinese utilized \"Etiquette\", or \u79ae\u5100, as guideline, clothing, which is the first point of Etiquette, is consider more important over food.\n\nc) Grammar. Since \u98df is a verb, but \u8863 is a noun, \u98df\u8863 by itself can be made into a term (eat clothing). Changing the order makes it easy to see it's 4 items, and sounds better. However, does that mean the order doesn't matter at all, just whatever that makes this idiom sound better?\n\nAccording to those articles, health is not consider a reason for such, despite misema theory was also used in China. My suspicion is that it's rolled into \"symbol of civilized person\" - not sure if such intepretation is correct.\n\n2) Based on the implication of Sun Yet-San's speech, the ancient Chinese doesn't care about transportation as a basic need - despite the creation of great canals. Is his intepretation correct? If yes, why would ancient Chinese not care about transportation? If not, is it just implied through the 3 basic need?\n\n3) In brief, do other civilization in history see transportation as a basic need, or as secondary need - and how should we intepret their actions to determine if they consider transportation as basic needs?

I know they boasted a strong Shia identity and led massive their efforts to spread Shia Islam throughout their territory. However, they also had a reputation for being extremely anti-Sunni and for brutally oppressing Sunni Muslims within their borders, which included Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, and other areas.\n\nA good example is how Safavid rulers, one after another, treated Sunni religious leaders and scholars. Many of these individuals were either killed or exiled, and their mosques and graves were destroyed as a means of minimizing Sunni influence. The Safavids also enforced the cursing of the first three caliphs of Islam, an act Sunnis considered highly inflammatory.\n\nAdditionally, Safavid rulers utilized intimidation and physical violence as a means of forcing Sunnis to convert to Shia Islam. This could include acts like torture, imprisonment, and even execution for those who refused to conform.\n\nI must mention that the Safavid dynasty was not the only one in history to engage in such acts of religious persecution. However, their strong anti-Sunni stance and the extreme measures they took to suppress Sunni beliefs and practices do stand out as particularly noteworthy.\n\nI\u2019m mostly curious about:\n\n1. **Why such Shia Muslim empire thought it was okay to kill Sunni Muslims; what or who gave them the license to kill innocent people?**\n2. **Why didn\u2019t the Ottoman empire, which was Sunni Muslim, assist those helpless Sunni Muslims in Iran and elsewhere?**\n3. **Why were major Shia Muslim religious scholars, such as** [**Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi,**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mohammad-Baqer_Majlesi) **quiet while the Safavids massacred Sunni Muslims?

Someone posted examples of graffiti shown in the book on [this forum](https:\/\/www.instiz.net\/pt\/4118548), so if you can read Korean, then you can see them all there.\n\nThe [abstract](https:\/\/www.kci.go.kr\/kciportal\/ci\/sereArticleSearch\/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001592743) says that this sort of graffiti increased in prevalence during the late Japanese occupation period, and it's pretty cool how they give insight to how the writers (mainly regular students and labourers) felt regarding Korean independence, identity and the Japanese Empire.\n\nMy Korean abilities are limited, but the graffiti seems to fall in several categories:\n\n1. Calls for Korean independence\/Self Determination\n\nMost of the graffiti seems to have some sort of call for Korean independence or some sort of statement regarding Koreans needing to 'wake up' and become aware of their self determination. Some of the ones I thought were interesting were:\n\n* A student from \uc774\ucc9c\uacf5\ub9bd\ubcf4\ud1b5\ud559\uad50 (modern day Icheon Elementary School) wrote '\ub300\uc870\uc120\uc81c\uad6d\ub9cc\uc138' (long live the great empire of Joseon) with a flag containing a blue circle (Probably a juvenile attempt of a [taegukgi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flag_of_South_Korea), the Korean flag) in a 2nd grade bathroom. Interestingly the name used, \"\ub300\uc870\uc120\uc81c\uad6d\" (Dae Joseon Je Guk - 'Great Korean Empire') seems to be derived from the name for Imperial Japan (\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b), which in Korean is '\ub300\uc77c\ubcf8\uc81c\uad6d' (Dae Ilbon Je Guk), most other writings generally use \ub300\ud55c ('Great Han') or simply \uc870\uc120 (Joseon).\n* One (presumably a worker) at a market in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province wrote this:\n\n>\ubcf4\ub77c, \uc870\uc120\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub9cc\uc138, \uc870\uc120\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd, \uc870\uc120\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ucf1c \uc138\uc6b0\uc790, \uc774 \uc5b4\ub9ac\uc11d\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc544, \uba39\uace0\uc0ac\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uc778\uac00, \uc870\uc120\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc790.  \n>  \n>translation (this might be a bit inaccurate): Behold, hurray to Joseon independence, let us raise up Joseon, you foolish people, is living to eat and earn money all there is for us? Let us make Joseon independent.\n\nThere are quite a few other writers who also seem to address their messages to the Korean people as a whole (or the 'race of the three thousand li' as another person put it - a reference to a [sobriquet](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Names_of_Korea#Sobriquets_of_Korea) of Korea), and a lot also imply that achieving independence was a sort of 'national duty' that Koreans need to follow.\n\n2. Denouncement of 'National Traitors' (basically [Ye Wan-Yong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ye_Wanyong))\n\nAnother common theme appears to be a denouncement or slandering of [Japanese collaborators](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chinilpa). Probably the most common example of this type of nationalist graffiti appears to be some variation of '\uc774\uc644\uc6a9 \uc2dd\ub2f9' (literally 'Ye Wan-Yong's Restaurant'); basically saying that Ye Wan-Yong, one of the [Eulsa Five](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Five_Eulsa_Traitors) and probably the most notorious collaborator in Korea, should eat sh\\*t.\n\nThere's also an example of graffiti in the Seoul area with similar rhetoric directed at the Provisional Government and Yoon Deok-Young (one of the [national traitors of gyeongsul](https:\/\/ko.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%EA%B2%BD%EC%88%A0%EA%B5%AD%EC%A0%81) \\- who were an important group involved in the total annexation of Korea by the Japanese), so I guess he's not alone lol.\n\nOther people are more direct with their insults though, like this writer from Nusang-Jeong, Seoul (1939):\n\n>\uc774\uc644\uc6a9 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc790\uc9c0  \n>  \n>translation: Ye Wan-Yong \\[is a\\] c\\*unt d\\*ck\n\n3. Comments on the War\/Emperor\/Japan as a whole.\n\nInterestingly, there's also some graffiti suggesting the wishing of Japan's downfall (presumably during the Pacific War), and also even the death or annihilation of the emperor of Japanese people as a whole, which seems to indicate that there does seem to have been some some degree of reluctance regarding the war, and even the hope that it'll bring on the downfall of Japan and an independent Korea among Koreans.\n\nThis seems pretty clear in this writing by 16 year old Choi Byung-Doo in Seoul (1941):\n\n>\uc5b8\uc820\uac00\ub294 \ubcf4\ub77c, \ub0b4\uc9c0\uc778 \ub188\ub4e4 \ub108\ub35c\ub108\ub35c\ud574\uc9c4, \ucc9c\ud669\ub3c4 \uc8fd\uc774\uaca0\ub2e4, \ucc9c\ud669\uc740 \ub098\uc05c \ubc14\ubcf4\ub188.  \n>  \n>translation: Wait and see, the Japanese will be in tatters, and the emperor killed, the emperor is a bad dummy.\n\nAnother writer, from the Namdaemun area of Seoul (1939), also expressed a similar sentiment:\n\n>\ub098\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc774 \uba85\ub9dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ucd95\ubcf5\ud558\ub2e4.  \n>  \n>translation: I bless the destruction of Japan.\n\nDespite the large amount of anti-Japanese messages, there's also evidence of pro-Japanese graffiti as well, showing that some of the population did have some loyalties to the Emperor and Japan. One example can be found in a sort of graffiti argument between 13 year old Lee In-Jae and the writer of this message on a train (1940):\n\n>\ud558\ub8e8 \uc18d\ud788 \ucc9c\ud669\ud3d0\ud558\uc5d0\uac8c \ucda9\uc758\ub97c \ub2e4\ud558\uc790.  \n>  \n>translation: Let us devote our loyalty to the Emperor every day.\n\nOverall though, it's pretty cool to see how average Koreans felt toward the end of the Japanese Occupation, and their personal beliefs regarding Korean Independence and colonisation, especially since most of the accounts I've seen seem to be from more prominent figures or just secondary accounts in textbooks and studies.\n\nedit: made some spelling and translation edits","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673092456.0},{"title":"The Forgotten Story of the American Troops Who Got Caught Up in the Russian Civil War","author":"Novel_Finger2370","url":"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/history\/forgotten-doughboys-who-died-fighting-russian-civil-war-180971470\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673031940.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/105ohnd\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

The Foundation was overshadowed by the First World War that just ended and the treaty of Versailles, which was seen as a adhesion contract by many germans. This led to a very tight political situation: the German Reich had 12 differnent chancellors in the years from 1919 to 1933, not counting Adolf Hitler. Multiple times the german economy almost broke down due to the huge reparations Germany had to pay to the allies. These circumstances made the population very open for groups like the Nationalsocialists, who took power in 1933, leading to the \"Third Reich\".\n\nPutting this inner instabilitiy aside, many people refer to the so called \" suspectibility of the  constitution\". Actually the constitution of the Weimar Republic was not much different from a modern democracy except for one point: the \"Reichspr\u00e4sident\" (president) could enact \"emergency decrees\" without permission of the parliament or chancellor, he was even able to completely dissolve the Reichstag (the parliament). Reichspr\u00e4sident Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934; president of the German Reich 1925-1934) made use of this power from 1930 on. In this time the chancellors wheren't elected by the germans, they were appointed by Hindenburg. The so called  presidential dictatorship finally led to the  takeover of power by the Nazis. \n\nNow this seems pretty clear: the Weimar Republic had pretty much the same problem that ended the democracy in ancient Rome, so it had to fail. But I think that it's not so easy. The thesis that the first german republic was doomed to fail was mainly expressed by german historians of the first years after the fall of the Nazi-Regime. This was a time where many Germans tried to process as little as possible, mostly because they weren't innocent in the years from 1933 to 1945 either. I think that telling the Weimar Republic was unstable (not because of the constant riots but because of the constitution) is just a (maybe even unconscious) try to reject the own fault. A try that was carried out into the whole world by German historians and is now accepted by most people. \n\nI got no one to discuss this with, that's why I'm posting this. \n\n(Please excuse possible mistakes in my language, I'm no native speaker)","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1672941978.0},{"title":"Gudrid, the Viking woman who sailed to America and walked to Rome","author":"AnCanadianHistorian","url":"https:\/\/bigthink.com\/strange-maps\/gudrid-far-traveled-viking-woman\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1672924016.0},{"title":"How Did Japan's National Identity Emerge?","author":"Preyinglol","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/10412ti\/how_did_japans_national_identity_emerge\/","text":"How did Japan develop such a strong sense of national identity and loyalty when prior to the end of the sengoku jidai period the country was splintered into many small fiefdoms all struggling for survival against each other.

However, this alliance was a defensive one. It stipulated that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation. In return, Italy will support Germany, if attacked by France. In case of war between Austria-Hungary and The Russian Empire, Italy promised to remain neutral.\n\n   Although, interestingly enough, in 1902 Italy signed a secret treaty with France, in which both nation promised to not go to war against each other.\n\n   In 1914, when World War One began, Italy declared their neutrality. There were two main reasons: the first reason was that The Triple Alliance was a defensive pact and Italy saw Austria-Hungary as the aggressor that started World War One by declaring war on Serbia and launching an offensive war, thus Italy was not obligated to enter the war and the second was the discontent of Italy in 1908 when Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia. This discontent resulted from the fact that Italy and Austria-Hungary promised to do not change the status quo in the Balkans without consulting each other (to which, Austria-Hungary did exactly the opposite in 1908).\n\n   In between 1914 and 1915, both the Central Powers and The Entente tried to pursue Italy: the Central Powers tried to keep Italy neutral and the Entente tried to make Italy joined the war on their side. In the end, the Entente won, due to Italy signing the Treaty of London and joining the war on May 23, 1915.\n\n   Unfortunately for the Italians, their campaign didn't go as planned. Fighting against Austria-Hungary, they suffered a great loss (in fact, they're greatest lost in the war) at the battle of Caporetto. However, Italy's luck was the fact that Austria-Hungary was their main opponent (an empire that, little to be said, did not performed as expected) and after the battle of Vittorio Veneto in the late 1918 the Austro-Hungarian army basically collapsed, ending Austria-Hungary participation in the war.\u00a0\n\n   In the end, Italy was on the winners side, but with a high cost: according to Wikipedia, the Italians suffered as many as 1,052,400 to 1,243,400 deaths (3% to 3.5% of total population). And, to add, Italian's economy was in total ruin. Sadly for the Italians, this is not the end: at the Peace Conference, some of the territories promised to Italy after the war and stipulated in the Treaty of London were given to the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Obviously, this angered and upsetted the Italian population and this deception will be known as the \"Vittoria Mutilata\" (\"The Mutilated Victory\"). The \"Vittoria Mutilata\" will mark the Postwar Italy and the rise of fascism marked by the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini (which will influence the rise of Hitler in Germany and will mark the first steps to World War Two).\n\n   Now, my question is: did Italy make a mistake by joining the Entente?\n\n   Well, given the circumstances in the year 1915, no. The Entente promised Italy much more territories than the Central Powers, who weren't so keen on Italy joining the war. Given the fact that, at the time, this was the biggest war of all times, the potential of territories that could be \"acquired\" was immense and Italy really couldn't say no if what they wanted was to be one of the most powerful nations, if not of the world, then maybe in Europe. Adding to the fact that maybe if they have refused to participate in the war now (in any of the sides they wanted), later the war situation may not have been so favorable, Italy seemed to do the right thing. I mean, they couldn't have known that their allies will not give the territories they promised.\n\n   And now, there are two options: Italy stays neutral or Italy joins the Central Powers. In my opinion:\n\n1. **Italy** **stays neutral -** For me, this is not really a possibility. Why? \"Given the fact that, at the time, this was the biggest war of all times, the potential of territories that could be \"acquired\" was immense and Italy really couldn't say no if what they wanted was to be one of the most powerful nations, if not of the world, then maybe in Europe.\"\n2. **Italy** **joins** **the Central Powers -** Again, pretty improbable: let's not forget the fact that Italy was still upset after the annexation of Bosnia, the fact that the territories that were promised to Italy were \"extremely wanted\" by them, because of the number of Italians inside the borders of Austria-Hungary (in 1910, there were roughly 800,000 Italians in Austria-Hungary). Of course, let's not forget the secret treaty with France. So, I think, at the time for Italy it was a lot more easy and a lot more conveniently to join the Entente.\n\n   For me, the story of Italy in the First World War is a very dramatic one. Motivated to enter a terrible war (in fact, the most terrible war at that moment when it comes to the victims and the impact it had on the world at the time and in the future) by the prospect of gaining more territories and the status of \"one of the most powerful countries in the world\", Italy ends up as the most unlucky of the winners. Cheated at the Peace Conference, with a general dissatisfaction among the population, a ruined economy, the weak government that tried to maintain the power was quickly changed with an authoritarian one led by the first European dictator of the XX century: Benito Mussolini. He will guide Italy to an even more terrible and devastating war.  \n   Maybe things would have looked different (in a better way) if Italy joined the Central Powers. It's difficult to say if the Central Powers would have won the war with Italy by their side. All we can do is to imagine scenarios that are just possibilities. Certainly, France would have had an even more difficult task to defend their country (as it happened in the Second World War). Maybe, if France was conquered, Italy would have gained more territories and the Second World War would have never happened. But this are just speculations and all we have is history and what really happened.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1672350598.0},{"title":"On Christmas Day 1859, a single shipment of 24 English rabbits arrived in Australia, triggering a devastating biological invasion with effects still felt today","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/www.cam.ac.uk\/stories\/dna-profiling-solves-australia-rabbit-plague-puzzle","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672213526.0},{"title":"People 'finger painted' the skulls of their ancestors red in the Andes a millennium ago","author":"limpy992","url":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/ancient-skulls-red-fingerpaint-peru","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672173307.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zx7tnv\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

Hong Xiuquan is a revolutionary phenomenon in the old days of the chinese empire, unemployed and a frequent failure in the civil service examination, which was the civil bureaucracy made by the ruling dynasty, Qing. Hong failed the test for the fourth and final time, and was in a state of deliria. By trusting his faith, and believing that god was on his side, Hong began his rebellion against Qing dynasty. \n\nThe uprising Hong Xiuquan established his own kingdom with a population of about 30 million and named it \u201cThe Taiping Heavenly Kingdom\u201d. With the help of the poor and the religious community, Hong made his own rules to serve every marginalized one of his people, for a start, women were officially able to take the civil service examination and for the first time there were women officers and military leaders. He also outlawed slavery, sex work, alcohol and opium. Although he changed the community for the good to its people, some of his trades were extreme and suppressed. Men and women were separated and even the married one can\u2019t live under the same ceiling due to his religious beliefs. \n\nIn 1847 Hong began his adaptation of, as came to be known, \u201cAuthorized Taiping Version of the Bible\" and he presented it to his followers as a version of the authentic religion that had existed in ancient china before it was changed by the Confucius and the imperial system.\n\nThe fall of The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was in 1864, Qing forces had invaded the kingdom after hearing about the death of Hong Xiuquan, that happened due to a food poisoning, although some stories proclaim that it was suicide. Qing forces exhumed, beheaded, and cremated Hong Xiuquan's body, and the ashes were blasted out of a cannon, in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as an eternal punishment. \n\nThis was only a summary of whom this Hong Xiuquan was, but his story is much more interesting than my boring way of telling.

Furthermore, US soldiers must have captured some STG-44s from killed German soldiers, and reverse engineering the assault rifle technology must have been possible due to the United States' massive industrial capability.\n\nToday, we know that automatic rifles are a staple of modern militaries, and the Soviets knew that during the late 1940s with the AK-47. However, the US military still used the semi-automatic M1 Garand several years after the war, and then replaced it with the M14, which was capable of automatic fire but was unreliable and uncontrollable when used that way. Only until the Vietnam War (30 years after the end of WW2 and the developments of the STG-44 and AK-47) was the M16 introduced.\n\nSo, I'm kind of confused on why the US didn't adopt the STG-44 after WW2.

A usual starting reference in these works could be the case of Robin Hood as a noble robber. Some fewer works are examining earlier incidents, especially within the Roman empire; where for example the case of Bulla Felix \\[early 3rd c. CE\\] could meet the criteria of a 'noble bandit' by some authors \\[eg. Gr\u00fcnewald \\[2004, p. 136\\] [in books.google](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=cfYw_aTUrmsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA136#v=onepage&q&f=false) \\].\n\nThe following story of Damon is narrated briefly as a local oral tradition of Chaeronea, only by Plutarch \\[Cim. 1-2\\], who was also a native of the town. Damon can't easily be considered a 'noble' bandit; however some similarities and doubts are appearing...\n\n\\[here's a short free rendering by me; a 1914 translation by Bernadotte Perrin with no different meanings can be read in [perseus](https:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035.perseus-eng1:1) \\].\n\n>Damon of Chaeronea was orphan and a descendant of a respectful & maybe noble family. Plutarch describes him as handsome with strong spirit, but uneducated and harsh. At young age he became the object of the lustful desire of a Roman military commander, who, being unable to gain Damon's love by words and gifts, was willing to use violence. In front of this fear and by anger, Damon along with 15 companions murdered the Roman in the market-place and fled. Soon after, the council of Chaeronea decided to execute the outlaws, but the latter reacted almost immediately killing the magistrates too.  \n>  \n>Lucius Lucullus happened to be at these places at the time and investigating the Roman's murder, concluded that the Chaeronean citizens weren't guilty; and so he left.  \n>  \n>Damon in the meantime had started to commit robberies and raids at the Chaeronea's country. So the citizens sent embassy calling him back, appointing him gymnasiarch of Chaeronea. But afterwards they murdered him in the vapour-bath of the city. Plutarch isn't clear if this was the plan from the beginning. Nevertheless the place was considered haunted since then, and thus was walled up; stories & beliefs that had survived till Plutarch's time \\[i.e. for at least 150 years\\].  \n>  \n>Right after Damon's death, the nearby rival city of Orchomenus took the chance to accuse the whole Chaeronea for the murder of the Roman. But Lucius Lucullus testified in their favour and saved Plutarch's native city; an act for which he was praised.\n\nThis story lies curiously as an anecdote at the start of Plutarch's parallel lives for Greek Cimon & Roman Lucullus. Beck \\[2007, p. 64\\] writes that this \"proem serves an important purpose in setting up negative behavioral models against which the positive aspects of Lucullus and Cimon are better able to be appreciated and evaluated\". However we should not forget that Plutarch was part of the Greco-Roman world, far away from the conflicts of the early 1st c. BCE; the years of the Mithridatic wars.\n\nSo briefly the possible elements regarding social\/noble banditry.\n\n* Damon is a descendant of a renowned\/noble family.\n* He starts his outlaw activities as a 'victim of injustice'; though the Roman didn't manage to use violence first.\n* He's mentioned murdering only local authorities who seriously challenged him; i.e. the Roman and the Chaeronean magistrates who condemned him to death.\n* He then commits robberies, but there's no mention of redistribution.\n* He seems enjoying some acceptance, at least at the beginnings by his 15 companions.\n* He seems living among his co-citizens Chaeroneans for some time; though it's unclear if this invitation was made with ultimate goal his murder.\n* He is surely tricked and murdered.\n* His story surely passed into the oral tradition, even if Plutarch mentions only the ghost part.\n\nUnclear for me.\n\nIt is mostly the part of the acceptance by his co-citizens Chaeroneans that causes me thoughts. And seems somehow necessary; according to Hobsbawm \\[1981, p. 17\\] [in books.google](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=0rVNXz-WhhwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT24#v=onepage&q&f=false) the social bandits \"*are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation*\"; while Gr\u00fcnewald \\[2004, p. 93\\] [in books.google](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=cfYw_aTUrmsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q&f=false) writes that they \"*are ones whom legendary tradition has transformed into folk heroes*\".\n\nAccording to Plutarch Damon was invited by the 'citizens' \\['\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9'\\] of Chaeronea, as a seemingly immediate result of his robberies and raids; thus it's implied that their interests could have been harmed. This part couldn't be the poor. Then they murdered him, while it's unclear if this was the plan from the beginnings.\n\nFurther, there's no exact date for these incidents, however Lucius Lucullus was in Greece at the time, so it should be during 1st-3rd Mithridatic wars \\[Perrin is giving 74 BCE with question mark\\]. And we can also remember the involvement of some Chaeroneans in the 1st Mithridatic war, fighting on the Roman side; as narrated by Plutarch \\[eg. Sull. 16.8, 17.6, 18.1\\].\n\nOn these Giroux \\[2021, p. 187\\], though seems sceptical to a degree, is giving the following interesting aspect citing Mackay:\n\n>\"*In a very thought-provoking article concerning the political changes of Chaironeia during the Mithridatic War, Christopher Mackay argues that the Damon narrative represented changing political power in the small town. When Damon was invited back in, he asserts, it was because an anti-Roman faction gained control and must have dismissed the charges of murder against Damon as well as removed the pro-Roman faction. When it was clear that Sulla would win the war, the town then murdered Damon, and possibly others, in order to show their support. The community thus rallied together to downplay events and to make them personal rather than political, hiding any disloyalty to Rome by altering the narrative by omitting the political shifts and the possibility of multiple actors beyond Damon. If this was the case, we can interpret Plutarch\u2019s silence on the changing allegiances of his hometown as a covert silence to set aside a troubling past, one based on political hindsight. For, as Plutarch himself said, '...a well-timed silence is clever and more powerful than any statement' (De lib. ed. 14 \\[10e\\]).*\"\n\nbut with the footnote:\n\n>\"*We have to keep in mind, however, that we do not have any direct evidence from Plutarch or Chaironeia that can support this argument. For example, it is possible that the Chaironeians recalled Damon for practical reasons, namely, to stop him from ravaging the countryside (Cim. 1.6). Nonetheless, it is notable that Plutarch did not relate why Damon was recalled but instead moved past this. In either case, it appears that Plutarch preferred to present the story of Damon and Lucullus from the point of view of individuals and in an indirect fashion, as a tale reflective of Chaironeia\u2019s loyalty to Rome*\".\n\nIndicative bibliography - references:\n\n* Beck, Mark \\[2007\\], The Story of Damon and the Ideology of Euergetism in the \"Lives of Cimon and Lucullus\", in Hermathena, No. 182, Philosophia and Philologia: Plutarch on Oral and Written Language (Summer 2007), pp. 53-69 | in [jstor](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/23041718?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)\n* Hobsbawm, Eric \\[1981\\], The Bandits, 1981 | in [books.google](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=0rVNXz-WhhwC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n* Giroux, Chandra \\[2021\\], Plutarch\u2019s Chaironeia: The local horizon of world empire, 2021 | in [https:\/\/escholarship.mcgill.ca\/concern\/theses\/6t053n18f](https:\/\/escholarship.mcgill.ca\/concern\/theses\/6t053n18f)\n* Giroux, Chandra \\[2022\\], Silence of the Lions, in Plutarch\u2019s Unexpected Silences, 2022, pp. 188-209 | in [books.google](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=_5x1EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n* Gr\u00fcnewald, Thomas \\[2004\\], Bandits in the Roman Empire: Myth and Reality, 2004 | in [books.google](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=cfYw_aTUrmsC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1671396511.0},{"title":"15 types of historical African swords","author":"ByzantineBasileus","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fjoGvOaFz_s","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1671277760.0},{"title":"The Erfurt Latrine Disaster - Weird History","author":"chickenusgoddus","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/njj77bkoUhY","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1671293898.0},{"title":"Black History Is World History - Aric Jenkins explores the sizable impact Black societies have made on ancient civilizations.","author":"DeepspaceDigital","url":"https:\/\/getpocket.com\/collections\/black-history-is-world-history?utm_source=redditsynd&utm_medium=social","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1671307968.0},{"title":"Proof of biblical kings of Israel, Judah deciphered on rock inscriptions","author":"Rear-gunner","url":"https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/archaeology\/article-725074","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1671263247.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zo5t36\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

But, of course his rule has had issues: Camarila Regal\u0103 (basically a group of corrupt people who were the favorites of Carol II and influenced the country during his time), the authoritarian regime he installed between February 1938 and September 1940, poor management when it comes to the external policy (which I don't think it is entirely his fault due to the circumstances and the European situation in that moment, but, as a absolute monarch between 1938 and 1940, he had the power to do basically everything he wanted, so he could have done better), his decisions to give up one third of the country's land without even fighting (I know the decisions were ratified every time after the Crown Council of Romania, but ultimately, he had the power to do as he wished, despite the decisions taken in the Crown Council and I do realise that the situation was not so easy, in fact, it was one of the worst moments in Romania's history, but to give up one third of your country without even fighting was a bit of a coward move and this shortened his time as king) and countless and countless discussions and scandals about his relationship with his mistress and future wife, Elena Lupescu (who, is said, had a huge influence on Carol and his decisions). \n\n   I think two things ruined his reputation: his weakness when it comes to women (which created many stories and gossips and also made him gave up the throne twice: in 1918 and in 1925) and Romania's territorial loses in 1940. We can also add his relationship with Helen of Greece and Denmark and their divorce and his bad relationship with his son, King Mihai I. The fact that his personal life kept interfering with his public figure as a King, as a authority in the country is the main thing that really wrecked his image. \n\n   As a person, Carol was very complex: we was both extremely intelligent (he knew and spoke four languages: English, German, French and Russian), loyal (when it comes to his relationship with Elena Lupescu), had a strong caracter, ambitious, determinate, passionate in everything about military, charming, an avid stamp collector, a very present culturale figure and an egocentric that always wanted the praise and admiration of others, a liar, a rebel, sometimes a bit of a coward, a person who always wanted to be independent, to have control and demanded complete submission from others, a fan of perfect order, (too) passionate about women. He was a very patriotic person, proud of his country and people, even though there were times in his life when his patriotism was put under doubt. \n\n   In the end, we must not forget that above all, he was just a human like the rest of us, with his qualities and flaws, that most of the time in his life was put under an awful pressure (as a Crown Prince, an ex Crown Prince in exile who gave up everything, as a King that returned to his country and people, and again, as an ex King in exile, waiting for his glorious return).","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1671233506.0},{"title":"The Garamantes: Rome's neighbours in the Sahara.","author":"AugustWolf22","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zmnnd5\/the_garamantes_romes_neighbours_in_the_sahara\/","text":"The Garamates were a civilization that existed in what is today Southern Libya, one of firs recordes of them was by the famous Greek historian Herodotus. despite their harsh environment they managed to build a unique agrarian civilization using irrigation derived from subterranean aquifers.

Can these invented ancient myths become as \"legitimate\" as the truly old histories\/myths of countries that have them?","author":"raori921","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zltns8\/how_do_countries_that_lack_long_ancient_histories\/","text":"I can think of a few countries that have had to deal with this question in various ways, on an individual or society\/national level, but I'm curious to see what the general reaction is in such countries.\n\nOne is the relatively well known case of **JRR Tolkien talking of his reasons for creating** ***Lord of the Rings*** **and the Middle Earth world**, or at least about his fantasy writing generally. He said in one letter,\n\n>*Also \u2013 and here I hope I shall not sound absurd \u2013 I was from early days grieved by the poverty of my own beloved country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil), not of the quality that I sought, and found (as an ingredient) in legends of other lands. There was Greek, and Celtic, and Romance, Germanic, Scandinavian, and Finnish (which greatly affected me); but nothing English, save impoverished chap-book stuff.* ***Of course there was and is all the Arthurian world, but powerful as it is, it is imperfectly naturalized, associated with the soil of Britain but not with English; and does not replace what I felt to be missing. For one thing its 'faerie' is too lavish, and fantastical, incoherent and repetitive. For another and more important thing: it is involved in, and explicitly contains the Christian religion.***  \n*For reasons which I will not elaborate, that seems to me fatal.* ***Myth and fairy-story must, as all art, reflect and contain in solution elements of moral and religious truth (or error), but not explicit, not in the known form of the primary 'real' world.*** *(I am speaking, of course, of our present situation, not of ancient pagan, pre-Christian days. And I will not repeat what I tried to say in my essay, which you read.)*\n\n([From Tolkien's **Letter #131**, in an answer here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tolkienfans\/comments\/iuxivg\/tolkiens_stated_desire_to_create_a_native_english\/))\n\nIt doesn't mean he always believed this in the same way his whole life, it could've changed, but Tolkien thought (at least here) that England was missing something like the grand or at least well remembered great epic traditions that other European countries\/cultures had. It's one Englishman's response to feeling native England had no great, pre-Christian mythical tradition.\n\nAnother case is **the Philippines, where many people believe that a lot of pre-Hispanic\/precolonial native cultures, including myths, arts, epic poetry etc. have been lost** **mainly because of colonialism**, 300 years and more of Spanish rule and Catholic conversion, and 50 and more of American rule, plus a lot of disasters and things like the WW2 Japanese occupation and American battles with them in Manila that burned or destroyed a lot of the historical records. As a result there are Filipino responses on the individual\/community level (like groups trying to really promote every little thing about precolonial history, or even writing stories in those settings, sometimes passing these off as actual records but which are hoaxes), and on the national\/government level (eg. [the **Order of Kalantiaw**](https:\/\/opinion.inquirer.net\/30125\/remember-the-order-of-kalantiaw), an award\/title based on stories of a precolonial Filipino chief which however are the work of a early 1900s myth-writer).\n\nI am interested to know how **the process goes of inventing ancient myth in countries that feel like they don't have them or have lost any memory\/evidence of them**. I know this is often used to political effect, in the worst case by fascist dictators for example, which is one reason why modern recreation\/reconstruction of ancient traditions is often so controversial (another reason is that it is seen as inauthentic or fake, being after all only recently made), but from their point of view, what else will those countries do to prove that culturally they are \"great\" or to be taken seriously? **Can countries that only have recently invented, \"ancient\" native myths, epics, histories, traditions etc., ever become as legitimate as the truly old great myths\/histories of countries\/cultures that have them?**","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1671031106.0},{"title":"The forgotten history of the US' African American coal towns","author":"StationFrosty","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/travel\/article\/20221023-the-forgotten-history-of-the-us-african-american-coal-towns","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1670980710.0},{"title":"Ancient inhabitants of the Basin of Mexico kept an accurate agricultural calendar using sunrise observatories and mountain alignments","author":"Rear-gunner","url":"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/full\/10.1073\/pnas.2215615119","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1670993573.0},{"title":"I have translated some letters between the khans of Mongolian and Manchus recorded in the Manchus literary sources, pretty funny how they were roasting each other.","author":"Karvier","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zkznqy\/i_have_translated_some_letters_between_the_khans\/","text":"On the 22nd day of October, Kalka Mongol\u2019s prince Joriktu hvng baturu and other princes sent us a letter:\u201d To Manchu\u2019s Sure Kundulun Khan: we attacked you several times before, and that is all Jaisai\u2018s fault, you knew that. You said China is our mutual enemy, and we should attack it, that was very true! We would like to cooperate with you till we capture their Shanhai pass. The Buddha and Tengri will witness it if we do not honour these words. Secondly, if you want to make peace with the Chinese, you should discuss it with us first because we also want to be included in the treaty. If the Chinese bribe you without bribing us, you should not accept it, same goes for us. If you can honour these words, your name shall be praised. \u201d \r\n\r\nThen we heard that Mongol\u2019s Chahar khan sent a messenger named Kangkar Baihv together with the Kalka\u2019s, so we sent them 2 bulls and 2 bottles of liquor. The letter from Chahar khan said:\u201d Baturu Cinggis Khan, the ruler of 40 tumen Mongols send regards to Sure Kundulun khan, the ruler of 3 tumen Juxen(meaning plebs in Manchu) that lived near water:  How are you? China is our mutual enemy, I heard you were raiding them for the past two years. In this summer I also went to Guangning myself, captured the city and imposed a tribute on the Chinese living there. Now you said you are going to attack Guangning, I warn you there shall be some bad consequences. There had been no grudge between us before, but if those Chinese who have submitted to me got conquered by you, My reputation would be damaged. If you choose to not listen to me and follow my order, the Tengri will witness it. In the past years we used to have maintained diplomatic relationships, then I cut it off because your envoys framed me for being arrogant, if you think what I said was right, you should send the previous envoy to me.\u201d After reading the letter, all princes and ministers were outraged, half of them wanted to kill the messenger, other half wanted to cut the nose and ear of the messenger and send him back. The khan said:\u201d You are right to be angry, but that messenger has nothing to do with these, it\u2019s his khan who wrote bad words in the letter\u2019s faults. I\u2019ll make him stay in the court a bit longer, so I can write a reply full of bad words and order him to take it back to his khan.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of January, the khan sent Chahar khan a reply:\u201d To Chahar khan: you said:(Baturu Cinggis Khan, the ruler of 40 tumen Mongols send regards to Sure Kundulun khan, the ruler of 3 tumen Juxen that lived near water) why would you look down on us in such impolite manner? Because you were strong? I heard that when the Chinese took Khanbali, all 40 tumen Mongols were captured except 6 tumen of them. And you do not even have full authority over all these 6 tumen. The nomads of the right-wing: the Ordos,the twelve Tvmed and the Ingxebu are all free people, they had nothing to do with you. The 3 tumen left-wing Mongols were not all your subjects either. You do not even have 3 tumen Mongols right now and you looked down on us because of the ancient glories of 40 tumen Mongols. Yes, we 3 tumen Juxen were weak, unlike your 40 tumen Mongols and were unaware of your power. So the goddess of lady Abka(sky) and Banamu(land) favoured us and granted us 8 different states to rule. You then said:(Now you said you are going to attack Guangning, I warn you there shall be some bad consequences.) You are right for saying so if we were your enemy, but we were not! Why would you say such bad words to us who were favoured by the goddesses and looked down on us for the sake of Guangning a Chinese city? You would be absolutely righteous to say these bad words if you could retake Khanbali and save the 40 tumen Mongols who were captured by the Chinese, but have you? Before I launched my campaign against China, you, my Baturu Cinggis Khan, had also attacked them twice. The first time you lost all your armours and camels. The second time, Prince Gergen daicing\u2019s guard drown in the water and nearly 100 of your soldiers were captured. Which big city have you taken? Which general have you captured? Which army have you defeated? Why would the Chinese bribe you? It is only because I attacked China, killed all their men and took their women, that the Chinese were scared of me and wanted to hire you as their mercenary against me! China and Korea have different languages but their cultures are the same, thus they treat each other like their own people, and the same goes for you and us. If you are actually a wise man, you should have said:(I have always hated China, I heard you, my brother-khan, are about to attack them, may the divine helps you to take many cities, defeat many armies. And I would also want to join your force, etc). Alas, isn't that good? Why would you harm me and look down on me, a khan who holds no grudge against you and speaks a different language? The Abka and Banamu will witness if it is just because of the Chinese bribery\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1670948518.0},{"title":"Tod's Workshop - Arrows vs Amour 2 - Testing longbow against a full suit of armor.","author":"PointmanW","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ds-Ev5msyzo","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1670983115.0},{"title":"Medieval ship found in Norway\u2018s biggest lake","author":"J4tune1860","url":"https:\/\/sciencenorway.no\/archaeoloy-medieval-history-ships\/shipwreck-discovered-at-the-bottom-of-norways-largest-lake-possibly-700-years-old\/2110769","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670866452.0},{"title":"Cats first bonded with people in ancient Mesopotamian farming societies, leading to worldwide feline migration with humans","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/science\/cat-domestication-origin-farming-decoded-b2239598.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1670832113.0},{"title":"An Investigation into Vlad Tepes","author":"MiguelPolimatus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zkh8yc\/an_investigation_into_vlad_tepes\/","text":"[https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2022\/dec\/11\/dracula-vlad-the-impaler-letter-protein-clues?CMP=share\\_btn\\_fb&fbclid=IwAR3fi4mxTfInFxHOwdmU34s0TSMgCf-IW79A5DWBk3SJyEW4bEyAUW2E9gc](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2022\/dec\/11\/dracula-vlad-the-impaler-letter-protein-clues?CMP=share_btn_fb&fbclid=IwAR3fi4mxTfInFxHOwdmU34s0TSMgCf-IW79A5DWBk3SJyEW4bEyAUW2E9gc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Gleb and Svetlana Zilberstein\u2019s mission?

This document, which was signed by King John of England and a group of rebel barons, established the principle that even a king was subject to the law. It marked the beginning of the rule of law in England, and laid the foundation for modern democratic principles.\n\nThe Magna Carta was a revolutionary document for its time, and it had a profound impact on the course of history. It was one of the first times that a group of people had stood up to a monarch and demanded that their rights be recognized and protected. This was a bold and daring move, and it paved the way for other movements that sought to limit the power of rulers and protect the rights of individuals.\n\nIn addition to its historical significance, the Magna Carta is also interesting because of the many ways in which it has been interpreted and used over the centuries. It has been cited by leaders and activists throughout history as a justification for their actions, and it continues to be an important symbol of liberty and democracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting events in history. It was a revolutionary moment that changed the course of history and laid the foundation for many of the principles that we hold dear today. Its impact continues to be felt today, and it will continue to be remembered as one of the most important events in the history of human civilization.","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1670716216.0},{"title":"The Japanese cigarette brand weaponised against Chinese smokers in wartime","author":"zhumao","url":"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/magazines\/post-magazine\/arts-music\/article\/3202348\/japanese-cigarette-brand-was-weaponised-against-chinese-smokers-wartime","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1670630543.0},{"title":"A wall relief, comprising five figures carved on a bench in a communal building dating to the 9th millennium BC, was found in Saybur\u00e7, south-eastern Turkey, in 2021.

In other words the Spanish are often said or implied to focus (much?) less on trade\/commercial reasons as an ultimate goal for expansion, or trade was (much?) less a priority for them.\n\nTL;DR, **Is it true then that the Spanish empire, in most of that time,** ***really saw trade as a lesser\/secondary priority or focus***, **compared to other European colonial empires that were its competitors? If this is so then why?**\n\nOf course this isn't an all-or-nothing claim. I know that trade *was* at least a little bit of a goal even for Spain because again, no large empire could do without even a little focus on it. One non-religious reason they went to the Philippines was to get to the spices in the Moluccas, and another non-religious reason they stayed and named it is to trade with China, hence, well, the 200-year galleon trade. But somehow even with these, **commerce is still often described as \"less\" of a priority for the Spanish crown, especially compared to its commonly stated goals of Christianising its colonies.** *That* often gets the lion's share of attention compared to purely commercial activity, and maybe it's one reason that the Spanish are not often thought of\/stereotyped in popular imagination as *traders\/merchants*, unlike say the Dutch or even to an extent the British.\n\nThen there's the whole silver thing in Latin America, which it seems little or none of the other empires had access to, so maybe this also had something to do with why Madrid wasn't as \"trade oriented\", beyond extracting the silver and then at best shipping it to China through Manila, which again the galleons helped in.\n\nMaybe, if we cover late imperial Spain too, we can also factor in changes in colonial priorities over decades and centuries of imperial rule. In the early 1800s they opened the Philippines to world trade, for example, but even that didn't seem to benefit Spain itself much because other countries just put up commercial interests in the islands like the British, Germans, Americans and Chinese. Still this was also after most of Latin America got independent, and after the first 200 years of Spanish rule to begin with.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1670475969.0},{"title":"Could 16th Century European greatswords counter pikes?","author":"ByzantineBasileus","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZhEkF9FV6AU","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1670415092.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zezeqq\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

I'm an avid history buff, and I love to write. So I decided to pen an essay on one of the most interesting labor-related pieces of US history, Bloody Harlan: AKA The Harlan County War, an important part of a much larger, countrywide series of conflicts known as The Coal Wars which took place largely from 1890 to 1930. This series of skirmishes and strikes, lasting from early 1931 into 1939 and taking place in Harlan County, Kentucky, began because of the Harlan County Coal Operators' Association\u2019s (HCCOA) decision to cut miners' wages by 10%. The miners, impoverished due to their already low pay (this coming in the form of company scrip, room, and board), decided enough was enough, and some of them began to join with the United Mine Workers of America, in an attempt to unionize. The company took issue with the unionizing of its workers and began firing any known members of the union and evicting them from their company-owned homes. Not long after the company began firing union members, miners began to go on strike in droves.\n\nAt the height of the first strike, over 5,800 miners were on strike, with only about 900 strikebreakers, also known as Scabs, working the mines. During this period, the strikebreakers were under protection by \u201cmine guards\u201d, deputized private guards working under Sheriff John Henry Blair, an arguably corrupt, inarguably nasty man whose allegiance lay with the company. Minor skirmishes, in which striking workers and law enforcement officers exchanged shots, were a regular occurrence. The bloodiest of these conflicts by far was The Battle of Evarts. On the morning of May 5th, 1931, striking miners lay in wait near the Evarts railroad, ready to ambush the motorcade that was carrying goods to the strikebreakers working the mines. The motorcade was made up of three cars, with a sheriff's deputy in each. As the motorcade approached the concealed strikers, a single shot rang out. As with many of these types of conflicts, both sides blamed the other for firing first. What followed was pure chaos. Approximately 1,000 shots were fired, and the three deputies were killed along with a single striker. This incident caused strikes to become larger and more common in the Harlan County area. After The Battle of Evarts, the Kentucky National Guard was called in. The strikers thought they had come to protect them, but instead, they had come to replace the deputized guards and protect the strikebreakers and break the pickets.\n\nOn May 24th, the KNG tear-gassed a large union rally, and Sheriff J. H. Blair rescinded the constitutional right to assemble in Harlan County. The strikes in Harlan County lasted about a month and a half after the battle, with the majority of workers back to the mines on June 17th and union membership dropped significantly, due to the Coal Companies refusing to offer concessions and the Red Cross offering no aid to the starving strikers on the grounds of neutrality. Eight of the strikers were found guilty of conspiracy to murder due to the action on May 5th, and all eight received life sentences.\n\nA few organizations made a play for Harlan County, including the openly communist National Miners\u2019 Union. The NMU was a small success, opening soup kitchens around the county and convincing some of the miners to join up, but the majority were disillusioned with workers' unions by that point. The NMU organized strikes and pickets in multiple counties throughout Kentucky, and while some were minor successes, their attempts in Harlan County were utter failures. The final straw was when some labor organizers, most being clergy members, learned of the NMU\u2019s leaders' animosity towards religion, and denounced the organization. In the wake of this, the organizer of the Young Communist League, Harry Sims, was killed in Harlan County. Due to the clergymen's denouncement of the NMU, already dwindling membership became near nonexistent which forced them to close their soup kitchens due to lack of funding, and the Red Cross stepped in to feed and assist the miners that had been blacklisted from working the mines due to previous or current union membership. \n\nOn June 16th, 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) came into effect, which, among other things, outlawed workplace discrimination based on union membership. After this, over half of Harlan County\u2019s coal mines (the ones owned by the HCCOA) were operated as \u201copen shops\u201d (a place of work that allows union membership but does not require it) from October 27th, 1933 to March 31st, 1935. Despite headway by the unions, the battle for Harlan County between labor and capital continued in earnest. Sheriff Blair was voted out of office in 1933 and died in 1934, replaced by T. R. Middleton, a candidate who ran on a pro-union platform. The Kentucky National Guard was once again called in on December 8, 1934, requested by UMW organizers who had been threatened by bosses and deputies. The troops promptly escorted the union men to the county line. As national political support for the NIRA dwindled, capital gained the upper hand, and when the United States Supreme Court struck down the legislation's pro-union National Recovery Administration portion, shops with union presence in Harlan dwindled from eighteen to one. \n\nThe NIRA was not very effective in Harlan County, whereas the Wagner Act of 1935 was very effective in terms of hindering the operations of the county's mine operators. The new law outlawed several tactics used by coal companies, including yellow-dog contracts, company unions, and discrimination based on union activity. While coal companies across the nation responded positively to the legislation in 1935, Harlan remained resistant to federal involvement. On July 7, a group of deputies became angry at a public celebration of the Wagner Act and began beating several miners. \n\n1935 was a turbulent year even for Harlan; troops were deployed three times to maintain order in the county. On September 29, troops were dispatched to the Harlan County War for the first time. The governor referred to the beatings and harassment of the miners at the hands of the mine guards as \"the worst reign of terror in the history of the county\" was made. He stood up for and protected the miners despite the fact that a bomb had killed Harlan County Attorney Elmon Middleton several weeks earlier. \n\nThis formative, tumultuous period of our history, colloquially known as the Coal Wars, lasted from 1890 well into the 1930s, officially coming to an end in Harlan County in 1939. This long, bloody series of strikes and conflicts helped to show the importance of workers\u2019 unions, labor laws, and fair treatment in the workplace.

But as I was reading about the life of William the Conqueror (the one that will rule England) I've realised just how similar his life is to a tv drama.\n\nHis mother for instance was a commoner, literally a leather tanner that his father an actual noble had a relationship with. In fact due to the fact that he was pretty much a bastard, he was ridiculed a lot in his youth about being the son of a leather tanner.\n\nThen when he was older but not come of age yet, his father then left for the crusade and never came back due to being dying in the journey. Now William was the heir to his father's title and wealth however like a good story his status as a noble was of course being challenged by many people due to his half commoner bloodline.\n\nSeriously people were fighting for his father's title so bad that many times he was being targeted for assassin's. Many of his caretakers that was supposed to groom him to pick up his father's mantle was assassinated trying to get to him. One instance, his caretaker and William was sleeping in a room but ever the cautios fellow he had slept on the bed and told the young Lord to sleep on the floor so assassin's would since the bed was more likely to be a target. Low and behold he was correct and got attacked that night by an assassin trying to get to William.\n\nDo you see now how similar to a tv drama this guy life was? You get an underdog character that's a bastard to a powerful title but was challenged it all through out his life due to his so called commoner lineage.\n\nThen once he becomes of age and took his father's title as Duke, he of course became a violent man. He had seen death, backstabbing and many more killings in his life so much that he had grown to be this violent and ruthless figure that gave no mercy to his enemies. In one scene, he was besieging one castle and the defenders of the castle mocked the William by putting cow hides on the castle wall mocking him of his Bastard and commoner lineage. Then like any good tv drama, of course William gets his revenge, once he managed to take over the castle he skin the people who mocked him alive.\n\nAfter that was of course his love life. Being a Duke of course it would be beneficial for him to marry the a noble lady so that they can combine their resources together. So he chose Matilda of Flanders and have even send her a letter for hand in marriage. But this is a drama you see, of course she would reject the proposal. In fact she even mentioned that she wouldn't marry a bastard like William.\n\nThis of course enrages William so much that depending on the sources he either went inside the Flanders castle and beat up Matilda or he saw her attending church and pull her of her horse by her pigtails and threw her into the mud. Now Matilda was a short woman you see, she was only 4'11 while William was 5'10, so yeah she had no chance against this violent man. But like any drama of course the protagonist action was seen as a positive thing, since in both accounts Matilda would agree to Williams marriage proposal. Nothing more romantic than a man that shows his passion by beating you up I guess.\n\nIronically enough, their marriage actually worked. You'd expect it all to go wrong since he beats her up but hey his life is a Tv drama remember. Not only he loves his wife dearly, he had 9 kids with her and most of their kids was born before she reached 35 years of age. To give you a perspective the day they Wed, William was 24 meanwhile Matilda was 20. Not to mention unlike his father, William never had any mistresses at all not even a bastard. Which is surprising for a man that successfully taken England from the Saxon. In Matilda death bed William even vowed to stop hunting a favourite pass time of his to grieve his beloved wife.\n\nSo what can we learn? William the Conqueror life is literally a TV show drama but in reality. You get a guy that's a bastard and half commoner and had to fight all the way to adulthood. This violent man heart was only melted by his short wife who he loved very dearly.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1670301574.0},{"title":"How did Native American tribes indigenous to Yellowstone National Park (e.g., Shoshone, Blackfeet, Crow, etc.) perceive the land (e.g., thoughts on geothermal activity) and what was their relationship like with white\/European trappers and explorers entering the region in the early 1800s?","author":"electricdresses","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/zcoh0n\/how_did_native_american_tribes_indigenous_to\/","text":"I\u2019ve recently become interested in the history of Yellowstone National Park and am curious to learn about Native American perspectives on the land and their earliest known associations with white\/European trappers and explorers in the region.\n\nIn particular, I'd like to learn about any prominent Native American creation stories involving what is now Yellowstone NP, how various tribes historically used and valued the land (for hunting, lodging, etc.), and what their thoughts were on the geysers and the other geothermal activity in the area.

He was responsible for groundbreaking breakthroughs with artificial insemination. With Ivanov\u2019s use of artificial insemination, he was able to use a stallion's sperm to fertilize up to 500 mares. Most stallions could only father 20\u201330 mares through natural mating.\n\nThis made him popular among horse breeders, who came all across the globe to work with him. He had more ambitions then just horse breeding, and his interests revolved around hybridization between species. More specifically, Ivanov wanted to see if humans could reproduce with their closest known relatives.\n\nIvanov decided the best route to take with his project was to inject several female chimpanzees and orangutans with human sperms. He started his experiments when they were green lighted by the Soviet Department of Scientific Institutions in 1926. None of his subjects succeeded in becoming pregnant.\n\nUndeterred, Ivanov then tried to experiment with human women and ape sperms. However, he wasn't able to put his plans into motion from both opposition from his superiors and the death of his last orangutan \"sperm donor.\" Any further tests were prevented when Ivanov was hit by a purge and ended up exiled and imprisoned in what is now Kazakhstan.\n\nI heard some very sensationalist rumors that he was somehow trying to build \"super soldiers\" for the Soviet government (something that a History Channel \"documentary\" Monsterquest touched upon). However, evidence for this is nonexistent, and I've heard more plausible reports that Ivanov's intentions was to discredit religion.\n\nIvanov\u2019s \u201cHumanzee\u201d experiments are one of the little known but fascinating stories of the dark side of science. His works sound like something out of B-graded horror movie. I find it fascinating about how different the ethics of science was during the 1920s then today. On a side-note, I wonder how the world would have reacted if Ivanov\u2019s experiments successfully made a hybrid offspring?\n\nSources:\n\n1.[https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg19926701-000-blasts-from-the-past-the-soviet-ape-man-scandal\/](https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg19926701-000-blasts-from-the-past-the-soviet-ape-man-scandal\/)\n\n2.[https:\/\/blogs.scientificamerican.com\/primate-diaries\/stalins-ape-man-superwarriors\/](https:\/\/blogs.scientificamerican.com\/primate-diaries\/stalins-ape-man-superwarriors\/)\n\n3.[https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/smart-news\/the-russian-government-once-funded-a-scientists-quest-to-make-an-ape-human-hybrid-5043859\/](https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/smart-news\/the-russian-government-once-funded-a-scientists-quest-to-make-an-ape-human-hybrid-5043859\/)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1669656739.0},{"title":"On April 2, 1941, a Japanese foreign minister asked Pope Pius XII to speak to U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, so as to avert \"a war of mutual destruction\u201d","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/english.kyodonews.net\/news\/2022\/11\/9829fd08a091-japan-wwii-foreign-minister-asked-holy-see-to-avert-war-with-us.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1669545212.0},{"title":"New York\u2019s Grand Dame of Dog Poisoning","author":"nemo_to_zero","url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/11\/dog-cat-poisoning-pet-murderer-1930s\/672266\/?utm_source=digg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1669482581.0},{"title":"Archaeologists unearth rare sword from time of the Kalmar War","author":"IslandChillin","url":"https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/11\/archaeologists-unearth-rare-sword-from-time-of-the-kalmar-war\/145348?amp","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1669438758.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/z5703a\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

They are both well known and little understood historically at the same time. So here are some interesting historical facts surrounding these events.\n\n**The crimes of the Batista era, the Law of the Sierra, and the influence of the legal precedents of Spanish Law and Nuremberg**\n\n* It is well known that Castro and Che came into power overthrowing another dictator named Fulcencio Batista. According to analysis done by various groups, including the CIA at the time, \"*It \\[was\\] estimated that roughly 20,000 politically inspired murders and deaths during revolutionary action occurred during Batista's last term in office--March 1952 to 31 December 1958*\"(Political murders in Cuba--Batista Era Compared with Castro Regime, January 1963 CIA memorandum)\n* This background is itself important because according to studies done on this period, \"*During the rebellion against Fulcencio Batista's, the general command of the rebel army led by Fidel Castro introduced into the liberated territories the 19th century Penal Law commonly known as Ley de la Sierra. This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes whether perpetrated by the dictatorship or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959 the revolutionary extended its application to the whole of the republic and to war criminals captured and tried after the war of liberation. This latter extension, supported by the majority of the population, followed the same procedures as the trials held by the Allies in Nuremberg after World War II*\"\\_Ramon Treto Gomez(Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law, pg 115-116)\n\n**Out of the three, Che Guevara was surprisingly the most moderate when it came to the trials of that era**\n\n* Che Guevara has the reputation of being the most hardline out of those who led the Cuban revolutionary movement. In some respects he definitely was the most ideological compared to Castro, but when it came to the trials of the post revolutionary period he was surprisingly the most \"moderate\". Raul Castro at the time was the most ruthless in terms of being least likely to preside over trials that had due process. Fidel Castro presided over trials that typically involved bombastic speeches accompanied with calls for \"to the wall\" for the accused, which was pretty much a show trial.\n* Che Guevara surprisingly by contrast did not presided over bombastic, show trial like judgements. According to scholars analysing this period, \"*He went over the cases with the judges and reached his final verdicts coldly and neutrally, on the basis of evidence alone. According to Borrego, Che too great care in selecting judges and prosecutors. For instance, rebels who had been mistreated were not allowed to pass judgement on their former torturers. 'There were sometimes prosecutors who were on the extreme left' Borrego explained. 'One had to moderate those who always asked for the death sentence*'\"\\_Jon Lee Anderson(Che, pg 371)\n\n**Both Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolutionaries were driven by the pressures of public opinion**\n\n* Scholarship on this period universally agrees that the trials of the Cuban revolution had public support. \"*There was little overt public opposition to the workings of the revolutionary justice. On the contrary. Batista's thugs had committed some sickening crimes and the Cuban public was in a lynching mood. Newspapers were full of morbid revelations and gruesome photographs of the horrors and brutalities that had taken place under Batista. Bohemia published snide interviews with suspects awaiting trial and provided sanctimonious captions to pictures of the executions*\"\\_Jon Lee Anderson (Che, pg 372)\n* But it was simply that there was public \"support\" for the trials of the Cuban Revolution. There was in many cases active public pressure on the revolutionaries. Scholarship shows that \"*Despite the impression the U.S. media gave of the executions, there were some efforts to formalize, and even slow down, the trials. For example, on January 16, Ra\u00fal Castro announced that trials would be temporarily suspended in order to put together more convincing evidence against the defendants. The pace of executions may also have slowed as invitations were extended to several U.S. congressmen to attend the massive January 21 rally. As Castro warned, \u201cBe assured that we are going to be much more benign than what the people want. . . . f we follow what the people want, we would have to shoot all the informers, which is a considerable quantity, but you can\u2019t. One has to punish the exemplary cases, the minimum. For the rest, there are other punishments. Not everyone has to be shot'. But the public often felt the sentences were not harsh enough. As a tribunal member, Orlando Borrego, later recalled, people \u201cthought the sentencing was too benign. . . . Sometimes one asked for \\[a sentence of\\] ten years and the people wanted it to be twenty.\u201d Toward the end of the month trials were again delayed, and now appeals were permitted in all cases. Again the delays caused consternation, and soon new legal steps were taken to hasten the trials: the constitution was altered for ninety days in order to hasten detentions; prisoners were now allowed to be tried in any part of the island, not simply where the alleged crime had taken place; and six new courts were created in Havana to try war criminals.* ***Meanwhile, local protests continued. In Manzanillo, when two soldiers received prison terms instead of death, and one corporal was acquitted, the decision sparked a two-day riot. In Santiago the acquittal of a notorious man provoked tumultuous protests; and when the Tribunal Superior de Guerra overturned the death sentence given by a local tribunal in Pinar del Rio, sentencing the three defendants to prison sentences instead, public outrage took on ominous overtones, including veiled references to the potential such decisions had to breed counterrevolution***\"\\_Michele Chase(A Century of Revolution: Insurgent and Counterinsurgent Violence During Latin America's Cold War\/The Trials: Violence and Justice in the Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, pg 182-183)\n* Essentially what was said above was that when Castro would give a sentence that was considered not sufficiently harsh enough, he would face a backlash from the public which sometimes in some provinces in Cuba turned to protests and riots. Continuing in this vein the scholarship also states \"*In February 1959, in several towns in Oriente Province, local anger over what were considered insufficiently harsh sentences developed into organized protests, including a brief transportation strike and declarations to a local newspaper. Two rebel army commanders were sent to stop the disturbances and release a statement of warning '\\*****The problem posited by the people of Palma Soriano, protesting because Revolutionary Justice is being applied slowly and benignly \\[con mucha demora y benigdad\\] has served to allow Contramaestre to use the same incorrect procedure \\[protests\\]. . . . We say it is incorrect because they are using the same demagogic methods from 20 years ago, using public agitation to get attention. \\[But\\] a popular government, a government whose leaders cannot be called politiqueros or demagogues, a government that is resolving as quickly as possible all the problems brought on by the disintegration of a corrupt state, a government that loves liberty, respects individual rights, and is incapable of using public force against the people, because it emerged from the people . . . a government like this cannot be blackmailed with demagogic protests, disturbances of public peace. . . . We responsibly demand . . . that there be no more acts such as those in Palma and Contramaestre. \\[We ask that\\] when some injustice is committed, you go to the corresponding organisms, and you will see that justice will be done quickly****.*\"\\_Michele Chase(A Century of Revolution: Insurgent and Counterinsurgent Violence During Latin America's Cold War\/The Trials: Violence and Justice in the Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, pg 183)\n\n**Historical memory of Cuban and Latin American history influenced the decisions of the trials**\n\n* For the Cuban revolutionaries historical memories would have had an impact on the trials of this era though for Fidel Castro the memories emphasized would have been slightly different from Che Guevara. Castro and the Cuban revolutionaries when conducting the trials of the Cuban revolution would have looked back to the events of 1933. Whats' called the Cuban Revolution of 1933. After the resignation of Cuban President Gerardo Machado, dissatisfaction grew with the provisional government that came after him. Essentially in the ensuing chaos that took place mob justice prevailed where the people took things into their own hands which created chaos and instability.\n* Castro and the Cuban revolutionaries look on those events of the past in the 30s and it informed their decisions. They saw the political trials as a way to appease the people in order to prevent the chaos of past days from re-emerging, as mentioned. This perspective is affirmed in the scholarship that states \"*Those who were in Cuba then were well aware that if the revolutionary government had not at that moment applied severe legislation against the few hundred torturers, bombers and other brutal criminals long employed by the Batista regime, the people themselves would have taken justice into their own hands, as happened during the anti Machado rebellion, and thrown society into chaos*\"\\_Ramon Gomez Treto(Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law, pg 116)\n* For Che Guevara the emphasis would have been on his experiences in Guatemala and Argentina. Lets remember he was the international revolutionary of the group who famously travelled across Latin America on his motorcycle. Che was present in Guatemala during the Guatemalan revolution of Jacobo Arbenz in the 1950s. The Eisenhower Administration, defending the United Fruit Company, initiated a coup detat to overthrow Arbenz's regime. The key to the success of the coup was flooding the radio waves with propaganda and disinformation, and also getting key generals of the military to betray Arbenz, leading to his overthrow. Che was determine not to let that happen again. So to prevent a potential coup Che supported government control of the media to prevent CIA disinformation tactics as well as the trials of the revolution to purge the military of factions that could be used for a coup.\n* Che's experience in Argentina was also a factor as well. It should be remembered that he was Argentine. And for most of his life till his early twenties he lived in Argentina. This included WWII. It is well known that after WWII Nazi war criminals and collaborators escaped the Nuremberg trials. And one of the destinations they headed to was Latin America, specifically Argentina under Juan and Eva Peron's government. The trials of the Cuban revolution took place 14 years after Nuremberg. In living memory. And just like how Nazi war criminals fled across the atlantic there was a fear that Batista war criminals would flee across the Caribbean(which they did).\n* What's interesting to analyse in all of this are the motivations and perspectives. The memories of both of them would have been known to both and would have influenced both. But they emphasised different memories still. Castro approached the Cuban revolution's trials from a nationalist perspective. Che Guevara from an Internationalist perspective.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1668914923.0},{"title":"How did reinforcements join a battle?","author":"AbdelZn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/yzf3l7\/how_did_reinforcements_join_a_battle\/","text":"When two armies are fighting each other, and then reinforcements arrive for one of them, did they take the time to deploy in battle formation?

Japan wins the Russo-Japanese War; Korea loses its diplomatic sovereignty to Japan \n\n* In 1905, however, an abrupt geopolitical turn (not just for Korea but for world history) occurred:\n   * **Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War.** ([link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russo-Japanese_War))\n      * Before, Korea had allied with Qing China to counterbalance Japan. After China was defeated by Japan, Korea allied with Russia. However, now that Russia was defeated by Japan (which no one had expected), Korea was left alone with no allies.\n   * **This was something no one had really imagined.** Korea's foreign policy to ally with larger continental powers such as China and Russia was a rational one. However, **Japan's modernization and military reform turned out to be really effective in a way that no one had expected**.\n* The 30 years of Joseon Korea's reform (1874 - 1905) helped the Korean elites become better prepared for a wave of modernization. However, despite all the efforts, **Korea failed to raise patriotic military elites**.\n   * It seems that **many of the early \"traitors\"  were military men**. Those who opened the gate for the Japanese assassins who murdered the queen were the military men trained and funded by Japan.\n      * Japan had also been funding [pro-Japan organizations](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iljinhoe), winning over those had had grievances in the traditional Joseon society (e.g. illegitimate sons)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Japan\u2013Korea Protectorate Treaty of 1905** ([Eulsa Treaty](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1905))\n   * In November 1905, almost immediately the Russo-Japanese war, Japanese soldiers encircled the Korean palace. The Japanese President of Council (former prime minister) [Ito Hirobumi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/It%C5%8D_Hirobumi) entered the palace. He gave a [treaty document](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1905) to the king (now emperor). It was **a treaty that would make Korea a protectorate of the Imperial Japan and deprive Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty**. The king refused to sign.\n      * Given what happened to his late wife, I think the king was ready to be killed.\n   * Instead, the Japanese President of Council found 5 Korean cabinet members who were collaborative, and had them sign the treaty. The five would be remembered in Korea as [Five Eulsa Traitors](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Five_Eulsa_Traitors). They were all given titles and positions by the Imperial Japan later on.\n      * On a side note, Japan had secretly made an agreement with the US. In the [Taft-Katsura agreement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taft%E2%80%93Katsura_agreement) (1905), **Japan and the US endorsed each other's dominance in Korea and the Philippines**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Korean Reactions to the Treaty of 1905**\n   * The sign of the *Eulsa* treaty in 1905 **shocked the nation again**, after the queen's murder. In the following 5 years, public outcry, revolts, and assassinations ensued. Well-known events:\n   * 1905: **A famous editorial \"I Wail Bitterly Today\"** ([link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I_Wail_Bitterly_Today)) was published in the newspaper [Imperial Capital Gazette](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hwangseong_Sinmun), immediately after the sign of the treaty.\n      * *Nara ireun seorum*, \"the grief of loss of the country,\" became a dominant sentiment in literature and folk culture soon\n   * 1905: [Min Young-hwan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Min_Young-hwan), the queen's relative and the most important member of the Min clan who dedicated himself to reforming Korea, **committed suicide as a protest to the treaty**\n   * 1906: The first modern Korean novel, [Tears of Blood](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sinsoseol), was published. It blamed old customs and superstitions, and urged the nation's awakening\n   * 1907: King Gojong desperately looked for diplomatic channels, and **secretly sent three envoys to the Hague Convention at Hague, Netherlands**. However, they were treated as uninvited members, and Korea was no longer viewed as an independent nation.\n   * 1906\\~1910: Attacks and assassination attempts for the \"Five Traitors\" took place. Some of the five were severely injured.\n   * 1907\\~1909: Some of the former Korean army soldiers, peasant rebels (e.g. there was an army leader named \"[stone-stone](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Dol-seok)\" which indicated low birth), tiger hunters, miners, etc. joined t[he Righteous Army](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Righteous_army). They had **a war with the Japanese army for two years**, with over 17,000 righteous army soldiers killed and 37,000 injured.\n      * The remainder of the army and leaders **fled to Manchuria** (modern-day China and Russia border region) to continue their battles, comprising the first generation of Korean diaspora in Manchuria.\n   * 1905\\~1909: By 1905, there were **a few thousand Korean immigrants in Hawaii and San Francisco** \\-- mainly Christians who were introduced to the US by American missionaries as laborers. The immigrants were greatly shaken by the news of the treaty. In 1909, the leader of the Korean immigrant community, [Ahn Chang-ho](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ahn_Changho), founded an organization named [Korean National Association](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_National_Association), which would become an important apparatus for independence movement of Korean diaspora.\n   * 1907: [Pyongyang Revival](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pyongyang_Revival). A large-scale, historic **evangelical revival** happened in Pyongyang. A collective expression of **extreme sorrow and repentance** dominated. A missionary mentioned that it was a terrifying scene. Also, an American [missionary described](https:\/\/www.thegospelcoalition.org\/blogs\/evangelical-history\/the-north-korean-revival-of-1907\/):\n\n>Someone began to weep, and in a moment the whole audience was weeping. ...

And so the meeting went on until two o\u2019clock a.m.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1909: **The assassination of Ito Hirobumi, the first governor of Korea** who forced the Korean court to sign the treaty. [An Jung-geun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/An_Jung-geun), now considered as a patriot hero in Korea, fatally shot Ito at a railway station in Manchuria.\n   * He didn't want to be remembered as an assassin or terrorist, but wanted to be remembered as a honorable prisoner of war. He announced 15 reasons why Ito deserved to die\n      * the first reason was the murder of the queen in 1895.\n   * He also had famously **cut off the last joint of his ring finger in a blood oath to kill Ito**. It was very noticeable in his jail photos, and his handprint was very distinct. He used his handprint as his personal signature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 24. The emergence of Korean ethno-nationalism\n\n* **The emergence of proto-ethno-nationalism**\n   * At this point, Koreans were watching the world they knew fading away. The deeply isolated hermit kingdom was going through a painful identity crisis unseen from the outside world.\n   * \"Ethno-nationalism\" sounds a bit demonic in English language, but here I'm just going to show how it emerged in Korea as a reaction to imperial aggression. It's interesting that in light of modern scientific knowledge and methods, **some Korean scholars almost immediately started investigating their ethnic roots**. I checked what's the definition of \"ethnicity,\" and found out that Herodotus in the 5th century BC already gave a [definition of ethnic identity](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ethnic_group#Definitions_and_conceptual_history). It is:\n      * shared descent (\u1f45\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u2013 homaimon, \"of the same blood\")\n      * shared language (\u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd \u2013 homogl\u014dsson, \"speaking the same language\")\n      * shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b4\u03c1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 \u2013 the\u014dn hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)\n      * shared customs (Greek: \u1f24\u03b8\u03b5\u03b1 \u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1 \u2013 \u0113thea homotropa, \"customs of like fashion\")\n      * **all of which had existed for at least a millennium** in the Korean peninsula.\n   * The neo-Confucianists in the past were not very interested in studying the linear timeline of history. Famously, when King Gojong encountered an antique [Goryeo-ware](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goryeo_ware), he said \"this is not from my country.\"\n      * However, it does not mean that they were not aware of the historical continuity of Korean ethnic kingdoms from the distant past. The name of the kingdom *Joseon* itself came from the name of the first ancient Korean bronze-age kingdom *Old Joseon* ([Gojoseon](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/x3ot4p\/korean_history_dates_back_to_a_bronze_culture\/)). A 15th century [fantasy novel](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geumo_Sinhwa) tells a tale of a spirit from the *Old Joseon*, indicating Joseon Koreans' awareness of their distant ethnic past\n      * **Ancient ruins and old Buddhist relics were strewn in Korean countrysides and mountains.** Koreans knew that those ruins had been made by their direct ancestors. Seoul (*Hanyang*) was a relatively new city (still 500 years old), but people knew that cities like Pyongyang had existed from the immemorial past. Lots of folktales and shamanic songs told the stories of their ancestors from *Goryeo, Silla*, or even before.\n      * So, Koreans already had a sense of the shared distant past, and a sense of ethnic continuity. **The idea of race and ethno-nationalism imported from the 19th century Europe resonated very strongly with Koreans**, the same way it deeply resonated with the Japanese.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Ju Si-gyeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ju_Si-gyeong), **the first linguist of Korea**, founded the Korean Language System Society in 1886, and studied **Korean parts of speech and writing system**. Later he studied **phonetics and grammars**, and published many books in the 1910s.\n   * It seems that he also translated [History of the Loss of Vietnam](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_Loss_of_Vietnam)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* National Anthem ([Aegukga](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aegukga) \\- \"**The Song of Loving the Nation**\")\n   * The lyrics of the current Korean national anthem is traced back to the end of the 19th century. There were many different versions sung by different groups of people (court officials, military, social clubs, etc.) but it seems that most of them shared the following stanza:\n\n>**Hibiscus, over a thousand miles, splendid mountains and rivers**  \n>  \n>**People of Joseon, ever may preserve her.**\n\n* [Hibiscus syriacus](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hibiscus_syriacus) (*mugunghwa*), a type of hibiscus native to Korea, later became a national symbol of Korea. It is said that hibiscus functioned as a natural pesticide (attracting aphids and insects), so often planted next to rice fields, along with willow trees that purified water. Hibiscus is resilient and blooms a long time, so later it became the symbol of Korean resilience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Folk anthem: [Arirang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arirang)\n   * Arirang is the most representative Korean folk song that had been sung in all provinces with 60 versions and 3,600 variations. Most scholars seem to agree that the first Arirang came from [Jeongseon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeongseon_County) county, deep in the mountainous province [Gangwon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gangwon_Province,_South_Korea). A theory says that the song spread across the country via laborers in Seoul in the late 19th century.\n   * While the melodies and lyrics differ across versions, all include a variation of a refrain \"Arirang, arirang, arariyo,\" and **the theme of sorrow, separation, reunion, and love**.\n   * This would later evolve into an informal anthem for Korean resistance.\n   * In 1896, an American woman with a degree in Native American studies met three Korean students who were studying at Howard University (they had been studying in Japan, but upon the news of the queen's murder and king's exile in the Russian legation, they left for the US). She recorded a version of Arirang sung by them.\n      * I found a [video clip](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jnno4mRKBl8) of her recording (song starting at 6:33). While the song featured in this video is not Arirang, it is very interesting to hear how an ordinary scholar-aristocrat Joseon man, wearing a Western suit, sings in this very ancient way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Sin Chae-ho](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sin_Chaeho), **the founder of ethno-nationalistic historiography of Korea** (*Minjok Sahak*). He first developed his interest in history by reading Italian history and literature such as Dante.\n   * Just looking at the titles of his early newspaper columns is interesting:\n      * Relationship Between History and Patriotism (1908)\n      * The Hero Yi Sun-sin (1908)\n      * The Oriental Italy (1909) - he might have considered Korea as \"the oriental Italy\"\n      * The Introduction to Ancient History of Tan'gun (1912)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The concept of** ***Minjok*** **(ethno-nation) -** [Korean ethno-nationalism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_ethnic_nationalism)\n   * Shin was the person who popularized the term *Minjok* (same as Japanese [minzoku](https:\/\/sociology.iresearchnet.com\/sociology-of-race\/minzoku\/)) in Korea. It is often translated as \"race\" or \"nation,\" but I think that the most accurate translation is \"ethnic nation\" or \"ethno-nation.\"\n   * The concept influenced the development of [**Juche**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Juche) **in North Korea,** and also **blood and soil nationalism in South Korea**. Present-day North Korea emphasizes:\n\n>**one bloodline, one land, one language, one culture of our monoethnic country, which has lived in purity**\n\n* The idea of *minjok* further developed under the Japanese colonial rule and after the Korean War. I can't describe the whole [nation-building](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nation-building) or [state-building](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/State-building) process of modern Korea(s) here in this post, I would just mention a fact:\n* the **Korean language is the largest** [**language isolate**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Language_isolate)**,** i.e. a language that is not part of a larger language family. This gave Koreans a mysterious feeling about their language and ethnic origin, which led to lots of [bizarre pseudohistory](https:\/\/www.jedleahenry.org\/korea-now-podcast\/2020\/1\/2\/the-korea-now-podcast-64-andrew-logie-korean-pseudo-history), some of which are still influential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Mount Baekdu as a national symbol\n   * It's a mountain at the Korea-China border (9,000 ft)\n   * Shin made some pseudo-historical arguments that Koreans and Manchus were of a single race, and [Mount Baekdu](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paektu_Mountain), the spiritual mountain of Manchus, is also a spiritual mountain for Koreans. This idea was further developed later, and now Mount Baekdu is considered \"**the spiritual mountain of** ***Minjok*** **(ethno-nation)**\" by Koreans. It is considered a sacred site by both North and South Koreans\n   * A web of mountain ranges is now called [Baekdu-dagan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baekdudaegan), and is considered to carry \"***Minjok*** **spirit**\" or \"***Minjok*** **energy**.\" Interestingly, an [American author](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_A._Mason) made a thorough introduction online to Korean mountain sanctuaries, mountain ranges and the ethno-national spirituality ([website](http:\/\/www.san-shin.org\/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell \"ethno-natioanlism\" sounds demonic in English language, but it was a resistance theory in Korea. The Japanese had their own version of [ethno-nationalism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Racism_in_Japan), strong [ethnic body politic](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kokutai), and the theory of inferiority of the Korean and Chinese race (and others).\n\nFrom the 1930s on, the Korean ethno-nationalism would be severely oppressed under **the Imperial Japan's \"cultural assimilation\", or \"cultural\/ethnic annihilation\"** [policy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cultural_genocide#Asia)**.** Koreans were forced to [change their names](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/S%C5%8Dshi-kaimei) into a Japanese one, speak Japanese at school and in media, worship Shinto gods (Japanese indigenous religion), etc.\n\nLinguists were punished for doing research on the Korean language; poets were punished for writing poems in Korean. [An executed poet](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yun_Dong-ju) famously sang in 1941:\n\n>**With my heart singing to the stars, I shall love all things that are dying** ([poem](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Poetry\/comments\/y01bwi\/poem_foreword_by_yun_dongju_1941_in_the_1930s_and\/))\n\nwhich implied the perishing of the Korean language and ethnic culture. Thus, Korean ethno-nationalism gained **the status of martyrdom**.\n\n* Many Koreans still get extremely emotional about this topic -- commonly called \"***Minjok*** **emotion**.\" It is commonly said that \"our spirits (*hon, eol*) were being taken away.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany non-ethnic-Koreans who observe Korea now criticize the ethno-nationalism. [An American professor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brian_Reynolds_Myers) criticizes that both South and North Korea is not founded on universal values such as republicanism or communism, but the ideology of \"blood and soil nationalism\" -- one bloodline, one language, one land.\n\nWhat is my stance as an ethnic Korean who lives abroad? I would just quote a Bulgarian-French author's observation here:\n\n>**The (French) condemnation of attachment to national values changes significance according to whether you live in a small country placed in a sphere of influence of a larger one** \u2026 or you live abroad in a larger country where you are sheltered from any threat by a more powerful neighbor. **Paris is certainly a place that favors the euphoric renunciation of nationalistic values. Sofia, much less so**. (Todorov, 1994, Bilingualism, Dialogism and Schizophrenia)\n\nI think this applies to America and Korea, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo these \"ethnic emotions\" come from one's bloodline? Race? Genetics?\n\nI found [a very interesting book](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/RITUALS-SEPARATION-Korean-Identity-Belonging-ebook\/dp\/B01MQFLWDK\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=I3KOLFHETUKA&keywords=rituals+of+separation&qid=1665607664&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=rituals+of+separation%2Caps%2C273&sr=8-1) written by **a blonde, white American woman who grew up in Seoul** between the age 0 to 16. Even after she returned to America with her missionary parents, **Korea was her motherland, even her spiritual home**. She pours out her \"ethnic\" knowledge and feelings and emotions she absorbed as a child. **The helplessness that the nation felt**, **the collective ache** Koreans feel about their history and culture. Interestingly, she talked a lot about the same historical knowledge that I laid out in this long series of Joseon posts.\n\nReading this book, I was thinking that what makes me feel the way I feel is not my race or blood, but the deep and intimate knowledge that I hold dear to my heart about the language, history, and culture of the nation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nclosing episode: \n\n# 25. Japan\u2013Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910\n\n* By 1910, there were already about 170,000 Japanese nationals living in Korea. These settlers had already begun to colonize agricultural land in Korea - the methods were similar to what was used in other colonies. **Traditional ownership of land by Korean farmers or tenants was denied if there was no written or legal proof**, and such lands were taken and handed over to Japanese individuals or corporations. By 1910, about 5\\~8% of arable land of Korea had already come under Japanese control. By 1930, it soared to 50%.\n* Judging that the time was ripe, **in 1910, Japan annexed Korea**. That was the official end of the 500 years of the Joseon dynasty, and the beginning of a painful journey of Korea into the modern world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------\n\nThe next phases in Korean history are:\n\n* the 36 years of the Japanese colonial rule of Korea \\[1910-1945\\]\n* US-Soviet occupation \\[1945-1948\\]\n* Election in the US-occupied South and division \\[1948\\]\n* Korean War \\[1950-1953\\]\n\nI'm not sure if I will write further -- the modern history is better known to the outside world, and English sources are abundant. Plus the story is very dark. Joseon was dark enough lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Just one thing I want to briefly mention is that **about 20\\~25% of North Korean population were wiped out during the Korean War** ([NYTimes](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/01\/world\/asia\/korean-war-history.html)). Napalms were dropped upon cities and civilians in the US air raids, and only a few buildings were left in the ancient city Pyongyang. More civilians died during the Korean War than in the Vietnam War. But somehow the Korean War became \"forgotten\" although many of the US operations could be considered war crimes\n   * Regardless of how terrible the North Korean regime is now, this should be remembered.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nThe history and culture of Joseon is not well known to the outside world, but is crucial to understand the modern South and North Korea. This series got really long but I hope this has provided a good overview.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1668305365.0},{"title":"600-year-old coin may be oldest found in Canada","author":"IslandChillin","url":"https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/11\/600-year-old-coin-may-be-oldest-found-in-canada\/145160","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1668236248.0},{"title":"How Centuries-Old Whaling Logs Are Filling Gaps In Our Climate Knowledge","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/www.civilbeat.org\/2022\/11\/how-centuries-old-whaling-logs-are-filling-gaps-in-our-climate-knowledge\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1668206407.0},{"title":"An examination of a Chinese greatsword","author":"ByzantineBasileus","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=urz8vhJpcIY","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1668253334.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/yt6et7\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

However, this section might be a little bit different.\n\nI took an equivalent of AP Korean History when I was a high school student in Korea. I learned about a long list of events between 1850-1900 including a coup, riot, rebellion, murder, and exile, but they all looked random to me. In this post, I argue that **all these events are best understood when one considers Queen Myeongseong (aka Queen Min), the wife of King Gojong, as the most influential court politician of the time who set out the direction of opening and reform**.\n\nThe version of the story that is commonly remembered by the Korean public is as following:\n\n* 1. King Gojong was a weak man, and he was under the influence of his father and his wife. His father was a strong man, and his wife also had a strong personality.\n* 2. His father and his wife didn't get along well.\n* 3. The queen (his wife) lavishly spent the nation's wealth, but she was a pitiful queen at the end of the day, because she was violently murdered by the evil Japanese.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis narrative does not highlight the fact that\n\n* **1. The queen was the one who ended the 10 years of extreme isolationist, conservative policies driven by her father-in-law**\n* 2. **She was the one who drove the subsequent 20 years of opening and reform of the country.** She was the one who opened up the border and invited Western missionaries to build modern hospitals and schools\n* 3. **She also had a keen sense of diplomacy, understood that Japan was the biggest national security threat**, and tried to ally with China (and later Russia) to check Japan's rising influence. **She was consistently anti-Japan**. **This eventually led to her violent murder by the Japanese.**\n\nSerious gender bias played out in her historical evaluation and later public discourses in Korea. She was often accused of being power-hungry, lavish, irrational and domineering, but the records of her contemporaries say that she was an outstanding intellectual and political figure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer story is even more dramatic in a sense that she was carefully chosen as a queen by her father-in-law because she was from a peripheral aristocratic family with no father or brothers who could take power. **Her father-in-law never imagined that the fatherless little girl would grow up to be his most fierce political nemesis**.\n\n**Her changing relationship with her same-age husband King Gojong over 30 years was also dramatic, complex, and multi-dimensional**. They essentially grew up together (from 15 years old to 45 years old), and the king was, in the end, deeply attached to the queen. His famous exile to the Russian ligation is best understood as his shocked reaction to her violent murder by the Japanese, and his will to continue his murdered wife's policy directions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, **I think her life is a Netflix show material.** lol. It's a fascinating time and I hope someone will dramatize it.\n\nThe following are some of the mentions about her by her contemporaries:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As a diplomat, the queen demonstrated outstanding skills. When dealing with the problems of foreign powers and interests in Europe and America, **the queen carefully reviewed each issue and presented her opinions before King Gojong, and her logic was precise and orderly**, and she often impressed foreign diplomats.  \n>  \n>\\- Yoon Chi-ho  \n>  \n>I was impressed by the queen's graceful and charming manners, her thoughtful hospitality, her superior intelligence and dignity. Although she was communicated to me through an interpreter, her speech was excellent. **I came to fully understand her bizarre political influence, her power to command, not just her king, but many others.** When a conversation started, especially when she became interested in the content of the conversation, her face shone with a dazzling intellect.  \n>  \n>\\- Isabella Budd Bishop, \"Korea and Her Neighbors\"  \n>  \n>At that time, Japan had no choice but to eliminate the empress, a representative figure, to eliminate the possibility of collusion between Joseon and Russia. **She was an outstanding person of her time**.  \n>  \n>\\- Hideo Kobayakawa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* Disclaimer: The Queen is commonly referred to as Empress Myeongseong in contemporary Korea, because she was posthumously elevated to the status of the Empress in the short-lived Korean Empire (1897-1910) later on. But I think that this is an inflated title -- Korea was never an empire in any real sense, and she was never an empress when she was alive. In this post, I would simply refer to her as \"the Queen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Phase 5. Into a Frightening New World [1864~1910]\n\n**The Opium Wars were a critical moment** \\- everyone was watching what was happening in China. 6 years after the defeat of China in the Second Opium War (1860), **the Japanese reformists would start a dramatic coup and achieve the Meiji Restoration in two years**. From that point, they rapidly adopted Western institutions and modernized their country. This quick transition was enabled by centuries of engagement in international trades, the growth of market economies, and knowledge of the West accumulated from that. Military conscription of the ruling class did not meet resistance.\n\nIn China and Korea, such a radical coup did not happen, and the reform was only slowly being introduced by old monarchs and aristocrats. In both countries, reformists had been poisoned, killed, and executed for decades.\n\nThe first reform in those countries was military reform, but it was limited to raising an elite military unit with Western weaponry without changing institutions: commonly known as \"Eastern principles, Western tools\" approach. Conscription of the ruling class was unthinkable under the Confucian ideology.\n\n**The ideology that was the foundation of Joseon Korea was failing**, and Koreans would go through painful soul searching and eventual annexation by Japan in 1910.\n\nBut there were two important rulers before that: *Daewongun*, a conservative isolationist who was the father of King *Gojong*, and **Queen** ***Myeongseong*** **(aka Queen Min), who would turn out to be the most important reformist politician** in Joseon court (who was originally from a peripheral aristocrat family).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 19. A royal outsider becomes the Regent of Joseon, and continues isolationist policies for 10 more years [1864~1874]\n\n*Heungseon Daewongun* ([link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heungseon_Daewongun)), whose birth name was *Yi Ha-eung*, was far in the order of succession in the royal family. It is said that he deliberately acted libertine - drinking a lot, hanging out with commoners, and visiting gisaengs (geisha\/courtesan) to avoid attention.\n\nThen **his son** \\[[King Gojong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gojong_of_Korea)\\] **was selected as the next puppet boy king**. *Daewongun* (the father) revealed his true color as an ambitious power-hungry man, and started gaining power as the regent. He effectively weakened the power of the corrupt Andong Kim clan, but he turned out to be **a stubborn guardian of neo-Confucianism and extreme isolationism**. Joseon maintained its reputation as a \"hermit kingdom.\"\n\nIt was a time when foreign ships started appearing and demanded the opening of ports and trades ([French expedition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/French_expedition_to_Korea), [US Gereral Sherman Incident,](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Sherman_incident) [US expedition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_expedition_to_Korea)). China was defeated in the historic Opium Wars. However, *Daewongun* was stubborn and his foreign policy was simply: \"**no treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.**\"\n\n**Koreans were still prohibited from leaving the country** (except for a few diplomats), and all **foreigners were barred entry into the country** except for a few Chinese or Japanese diplomats. ([link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Imo_Incident))\n\n* e.g. Daewongun was furious about a precise map ([Daedongyeojido](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daedongyeojido)) made by a Korean cartographer [Kim Jeong-ho](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gim_Jeong-ho) influenced by Western science \n\nHis most important achievement was the reconstruction of Gyeongbok Palace, which had been destroyed 250 years ago in the devastating war with Japan.\n\n* The Korean public weirdly remembers that Queen *Myeongseong* lavishly spent the country's wealth, but it was actually *Daewongun* who imposed a huge tax burden on the public for this symbolic project of no practical importance (other than being used as a tourist attraction a hundred years later)\n\n>A historian Bruce Cumings notes that \\[his reign\\] was not a revolution but a **restoration**, as the Daewongun was **attempting to return to the days of King Sejong in the fifteenth century**\n\nOverall, he was a fierce guardian of *Wijeong Cheoksa* (\"Preserve the Right, Dispel the Heresy\" - heresy meaning Western science and Christianity). Japan was rapidly modernizing their country in this 10-year time period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 20. The queen, a fatherless, brotherless 25-year-old woman from a peripheral noble family, effectively expels her father-in-law from power\n\n*Daewongun*, the regent, carefully chose **a 15-year old girl** (birth name *Min Ja-yeong*) **from a peripheral noble family (Min clan) who had no father and brothers** as the wife of his son King *Gojong* (who was also about 15-year-old). He believed that it would prevent any potential [consort kin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Consort_kin) problems in the future. It is an interesting irony that, by doing so, he unknowingly chose his biggest political rival in the future.\n\nShe was not a particularly feminine or attractive girl, and she did not draw any attention from the boy king for the first 5 years in their marriage. However, **she was intelligent, poised, and had a love for learning**. It is said that her free time was entirely devoted to reading -- she particularly **read books about the ancient history and statesmenship** such as *Spring and Autumn Annals* (the history of competing Chinese states 771\\~446 BC), **which were not typically read by women**. In the meantime, the king, a teenager boy, was fooling around with court maidens.\n\nThen a palace maiden bore the first son of the king. It would have been an extremely humiliating and devastating news for a teenager queen. However, she calmly sent a very expensive gift to the mother, and congratulated her husband with a happy face at an official ceremony. The boy king was frightened and surprised. Some say that that was the first moment he ever paid any attention to her.\n\nThat said, this was a serious threat because queens not able to bear a son could be expelled from the palace. The queen, like any other previous queens in the court, desperately prayed to the shamanic spirits. Finally, when she was 20 years old, she delivered her first son. However, **tragically and famously, the baby boy was born with an anus deformity and was not able to discharge**. He died in 4 days. Still barely adult, the queen got extremely emotional, cried, and made the whole nation to hear her cry -- by inviting several hundred shamans to sing for the soul of her child for ten days straight, and by ordering thousands of Buddhist monks throughout the nation to pray.\n\n* Unfortunately, the popular memory (before her reevaluation in the 1990s) only focused on this event in her teenage years (\"she's irrational and wasteful\")\n\nAfter all this drama, the King Gojong became an adult, and started wanting to rule as a king himself. But he feared his father, and did not have a political knack to do so. This was the time when the queen started revealing her talent as a politician\n\nBy this time, she had already figured out the characters of the noblemen in and out of the court. **She united the men in her Min clan, and started placing them in major court positions. She also won over the people who had been neglected by the Regent** (her despotic father-in-law) -- including the regent's elder brother. The young queen was moving her pawns while birthing children. **When the time was ripe, the king announced that he would take the reign into his own hands, and would not allow his father to enter the court.** His father was effectively expelled.\n\n* But his father didn't just get expelled silently - mysterious explosions and killings happened around the capital shortly after\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 21. The queen, with the support of her husband King Gojong, drives opening and reform for 20 years [1874~1894]\n\nSoon, she delivered a healthy male heir. This consolidated her status and power in the court. **The young queen and king were now in political symbiosis -- her power depended on her position as the legitimate\/primary wife of the king, and his power came from her political intelligence and shrewdness**. They would maintain this idiosyncratic partnership for the next 20 years, until the queen was murdered at the age of 45.\n\n* Many foreigners' records described the queen as \"clever, intelligent, shrewd, and witty\" while describing the king as \"kind\"\n\nHowever, it was not just the symbiotic interests that bound the two. **The two also seemed to share a common vision for opening and reform**.\n\n* Joseon was still a deeply isolated \"backwater\" of East Asia: [For example](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Ok-gyun), most Joseon scholars have **never seen photographs of the West** before this point. **Such materials had been banned** by the father of the king before. Only a very few fringe figures had access to the outside world.\n* Both the queen and king were interested in new materials and knowledge coming from the outside world. It's famous that the king liked coffee, for example. **They knew that the world was changing, and were sympathetic to young scholars' sense of urgency to change and reform**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(1) Opening**\n\n* In 1876, there was a small skirmish between a Japanese warboat *Unyo* and a Korean island fortress. Unlike *Daewongun* (the former regent), the new regime (the queen, king, and their court officials) **agreed to open commerce with foreigners**. [The Treaty of Ganghwa](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1876) was signed.\n   * This was an unfair treaty in the sense that it gave Japan the right to survey and locate two new ports in the Korean peninsula, and it bestowed [extraterritoriality](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extraterritoriality) for the Japanese in the special port districts. The Westerners [had forced this to Japan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Treaty_of_Amity_and_Commerce_(United_States%E2%80%93Japan)), and now Japan was doing the same thing with Joseon Korea.\n   * However, the Korean history textbooks focuses only on the fact that it was an unfair treaty, ignoring the fact that it was a deliberate political decision made as an experiment.\n* In 1880 a [mission](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Hong-jip) was sent to Japan, and they got a document from a Chinese diplomat titled \"A Strategy for Korea.\" China wanted Korea to be modernized to play a role as a buffer zone between China and Japan. The document **recommended Korea stay pro-China, learn from Japan yet maintain a distance, and ally with the United States** to counterbalance Russia\n   * The mission also reported that, compared to the modernized and electricity-wired Tokyo and Osaka, Seoul and Busan now looked like vestiges of the ancient past\n   * **The queen took special interest in the strategy document, and had copies sent out to all the ministers**. This might have influenced **her life-long diplomatic stance (pro-China, arm's-length relationship to Japan, and alliance with Westerners**)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the early changes, **three different political parties emerged**.\n\n# (Party A) \"Dispel all foreigners\" - which was, unfortunately, the most popular approach\n\n# (Party B) Pro-China, arm's length relationship to Japan, alliance with Westerners (Queen's approach)\n\n# (Party C) Radicals (pro-Japan, aiming to imitate the Japanese way) - a rising faction in the court\n\n\\*\\* some radicals were sincerely attracted to Japan for ideological reasons, but later, some of those in the pro-Japan faction would be deliberately bought by Japan\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(2) Riot and coup**\n\nIn 1881, the court **raised an elite military unit** called [Byeolgigun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Py%C5%8Flgigun), armed with new Western weapons and trained by Japanese officers\n\nHowever, finance might have been the new regime's weakness. Joseon Korea did not inherit a functioning market economy, and corruption had been rampant at all levels of bureaucracy (legacy from the early 19th century - section 18).\n\nGrievances arose among the old army. Many of them were discharged, and the rest of them did not get enough salary in the form of rice. The minister of treasury, who was a Min clan member, was in charge to pay them, but he was inexperienced and incompetent. A subordinate swindled the rice and replaced it with millet mixed with sand. It got rotten, and foul smelling.\n\n* This infuriated the old army, and they raided the palace ([Imo incident](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Imo_Incident)) - they killed the Japanese, the minister of treasury, and several other high officials. They considered the queen and her clan members as main enemies who prioritized foreigners.\n* Opening and reform was not popular among the less educated populace (Party A), especially when it was driven by a woman. The rioters searched for the queen to kill her. However, **the queen disguised as a palace maiden, and narrowly escaped** with her guardians and maidens.\n\nThis set back the early reform efforts. When the queen was away, the (more easily pushed around) king signed a[ treaty](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1882) with Japan that promised expensive reparations. Upon learning about that, the queen contacted China and asked for their interference. As a result, Qing China gained more influence over the Korean peninsula\n\nThis upset the radicals (Party C). In 1884, [Kim Ok-gyun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Ok-gyun), a 20-something pro-Japan radical, made [Gapsin Coup](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gapsin_Coup) with [Park Young-hyo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Yung-hyo) and [Seo Jae-pil](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Soh_Jaipil) (all 20 years old) in order to replicate the Meiji Restoration in Korea, with the aid of the Japanese guards stationed in Korea. The coup only lasted for 3 days, often known as \"Three Days' Reign\"\n\n* This was quickly suppressed by a Chinese garrison stationed in Korea. This enhanced the Chinese influence over Korea until 1894\n* After the failure of the coup, the coup leaders fled to Japan; *Seo Jae-pil* later went to the US, studied medicine, and became the \"first Korean American.\" He married an American woman.\n* While negotiating with Japan and China, **the queen persuaded the Chinese envoys to keep 2,000 soldiers disguised as Joseon police without Japan knowing it**. A famous Chinese general (later warlord) [Yuan Shikai](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yuan_Shikai) stayed in Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(3) 10 years of peace - diplomatic balance and reforms**\n\nBetween the time period 1882\\~1894, **the queen (and king) consistently pursued the policy of checking Japan's rising influence by allying with Qing China and Westerners**. Joseon signed a [treaty with the US](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseon%E2%80%93United_States_Treaty_of_1882), [UK](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1883), [Germany](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Germany%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1883), [Russia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1884), and [France](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1886).\n\n* She chose that direction because\n   * (a) she knew that Japan posed the greatest national security threat to Korea - other nations (China and Westerners) were less interested in Korea's territory\n   * (b) perhaps she did not agree with Japan's radical modernization and constitutional monarchy model. At the end of the day, she was a member of monarchy, and had a class interest in preserving its power\n\nMany important changes were happening. I will just mention a few:\n\n**Economic opening and reform**\n\n* opening ports and collecting tariff from foreign trades\n* **establishment of first Korean corporations**\n* laying telegraph lines with China and Japan\n* the issue of new coinage (which unfortunately caused an inflation)\n\n**Medicine**:\n\n* an [American doctor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Horace_Newton_Allen) treated a severe wound of one of the queen's relatives. A rumor spread that \"a foreigner with bushy red beard revived a dead noble.\" Later the queen and king endorsed the establishment of **the** [**first Western hospital**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chejungwon) **and medical school** in Seoul. (a further[ story](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/nation\/2022\/03\/177_285903.html))\n   * [Another story about smallpox vaccine](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/opinion\/2022\/10\/715_309581.html)\n\n**Education and culture**:\n\n* The queen invited many **Western (American) missionaries to establish schools**.\n   * The queen herself was never a Christian, and throughout her life, she followed a syncretism of Buddhism, Shamanism, and Confucianism like any other Joseon woman back then\n   * But she knew the practical importance of Western knowledge, mathematics and science\n* The queen also gave her patronage to the **first all-girls' educational institution**, Ewha Academy (now prestitious [Ewha Women's University](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ewha_Womans_University)).\n   * The queen befriended several female American missionaries. The American women left many detailed, valuable records about the queen, undistorted by gender bias\n* First modern newspapers were published\n* Music: Christian hymns, chords, and instruments were introduced via missionaries and churches. Many of the first-generation Korean (modern) composers came from Christian families. They composed Korean anthems, children's songs, and national songs that are still taught in Korea\n\n**Continuing military reform**:\n\n* US generals were invited to Korea to provide advice and training\n* Joseon court also established a new [navy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Imperial_Naval_Academy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 21. Peasant rebellion, the queen's anti-Japan stance, and the 45-year-old queen's violent murder by the Japanese [1894-1895]\n\n**The opening and reform was not popular** outside of Seoul, among the less educated populace. **The vast populace in the provinces was deeply suspicious of anything foreign**, and rejected the new ideas of market economy and diplomacy.\n\nIn 1894, [a large-scale peasant rebellion](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donghak_Peasant_Revolution) took place, triggered by a local magistrate's abuse of power (*Gobu* magistrate *Cho Byeong-gap*) in the historically stigmatized Southwestern province Jeolla. This got magnified by a new religious movement called [Donghak](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donghak) (\"Eastern learning\" as opposed to \"Western learning\" aka Christianity). It was similar to China's [Taiping Rebellion](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taiping_Rebellion)\n\n* *Donghak* was a syncretism of some Christian creeds (equality between people) and Buddhism and shamanism. Its descendant cults and beliefs are still alive in Korea\n   * My post \"[Korean indigenous new religious movements' holy sites in North Jeolla](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/xakco4\/korean_indigenous_cults_holy_sites_in_north_jeolla\/)\"\n\nThe *Donghak* rebels had three initial demands:\n\n* (1) Stop the ban on *Donghak*\n* (2) **Expel Westerners, Expel Japan**\n* (3) Kill corrupt court officials and magistrates\n\nSome 80,000 believers gathered under the flags of \"Expel Westerners, Expel Japan\" (*Cheokyang Cheokwae*). Later it developed more radical slogans such as \"Kill all the Min clan members.\"\n\n* They **attached warning signs \"LEAVE\" to American, French, British, and Japanese residences, and Christian churches and schools**\n   * Ironically, many of their campaigns were influenced by Western ideas: equality, women's rights (particularly widow's rights to remarry), people's councils, abolition of slavery, etc.\n* Peasants were deeply sympathetic with them, and secretly helped the rebel army. They informed the rebels about the local geography and weather (e.g. mist), and sabotaged the state army (e.g. filling water in their cannons)\n* A rumor that ghosts (supernatural power) are helping the rebels spread among the state army.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis event might indicate the weakness of the queen's regime in controlling domestic affairs and local corruption. While she was an excellent diplomat and strategist, there's less evidence that she was good at internal affairs.\n\nHowever, I'd like to defend her given **the constraints of her time**. Noble women were normally kept in \"inner chambers,\" ([link](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/wzqxuu\/womens_oppression_in_joseon_era\/)) and banned from coming out of their residence in daylight ([source](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060217083642\/http:\/\/www.gkn-la.net\/history_resources\/queen_min_tmsimbirtseva_1996.htm)). The queen was deeply hidden within the walls of the palace, and **she had to be unseen**. All the official commands had to come through the king. There were few contact points between her and the vast \"real world\" populace out there. There was a limit in her capability to control the internal affairs, compared to what was available to male rulers.\n\nAlthough consort kins are normally demonized in the Confucian social systems, there is no evidence that the queen and her clan was particularly corrupt. Her personal spending was very modest, and the clan was under her control. The most famous clan member [Min Young-hwan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Min_Young-hwan) devoted himself to reforming the country, and committed suicide when Korea lost sovereignty to Japan. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a reaction to the rebellion, the Joseon court organized a committee for the [first large-scale reform](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gabo_Reform). Then a series of international events followed:\n\n* **Both Qing China and Japan tried to aid Joseon to quell the peasant rebellion, to increase their influence** in the Korean peninsula\n* There were both pro-China and pro-Japan factions in the Joseon court. The queen was pro-China (Party B), but there were lots of pro-Japan court officials (Party C)\n* **Japan was expanding their influence over the pro-Japan faction in Joseon. They also funded a** [**military unit**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hullyeondae) in the capital of Joseon, which would help Japanese operations later on\n* The first Sino-Japanese War [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/First\\_Sino-Japanese\\_War](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/First_Sino-Japanese_War) occurred - and unexpectedly, **Japan won, China lost.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter watching China losing the war, **the queen swiftly moved to ally with Russia to counterbalance Japan**. Japan was practically the biggest national security threat to Joseon, and the Japanese officials were already discussing a [military expedition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seikanron) into Joseon. Her foreign policy was consistently about checking Japan's rising influence.\n\n* In 1895, while inviting Russians to the court, **she ordered the disbandment of the Japan-funded military unit** ([Hullyeondae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hullyeondae)).\n\nThis was what rang the death knell for the queen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn October of 1895, dozens of Japanese swordsmen entered the Korean palace. The Japan-funded Korean military unit (that the queen had tried to disband) cooperated to open the gate. **The Japanese swordsmen violently slaughtered the 45-year-old queen with katanas, \"violated\" her dead body** (I'd rather not know what happened), **displayed her dead body to Russians in the court as a warning**, **and burned her body to ash in a forest**.\n\nEven the most pro-Japan Western[ historian](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Keene)s describe the event as \"unspeakably barbaric.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 21. The shockwave of the queen's violent murder; a short-lived Korean Empire \n\nDid the queen and king love each other?\n\n* It is hard to tell. They were primarily political partners, their fates being intertwined. The Confucian polygamy allowed (and encouraged) the king to sleep around with different women and have children with them, while the queen had to be strictly faithful to the man. Would any modern woman be able to stand it? It must be very difficult.\n   * But they grew together. For the first 5 years in their marriage, they were just children forced to be together. As they grew into adulthood, they discovered the potential as political partners in each other, and also became conjugal partners in a real sense. They had children together, explored the frightening new world, and pursued opening and reform together. **While the king did not have the political astuteness and shrewdness of the queen, he was a kind and warm-hearted man, sometimes had his own opinions and discussed them with the queen based on mutual respect**.\n* Right after the queen's murder, the king's father *Daewongun* (the expelled former regent) immediately, a bit pathetically, returned to the palace upon the news. **The father demanded that the king sign an edict to demote the murdered queen to a lower-rank consort.** **The king refused it with unusual decisiveness, saying: \"I would rather have my hands cut off.\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe king was deeply depressed after the murder, and spent months in his chamber doing nothing. Then, he suddenly left his palace with his crown prince son, and voluntarily exiled into the Russian legation. There, **he continued the queen's policy direction--alliance with Russia--, and started kicking out the pro-Japan faction**. He got rid of them from his new cabinet, and executed several high officials in the pro-Japan faction. He willingly continued the policy direction of his murdered wife.\n\n* Soon his father died, but **the king did not even attend his father's funeral**, which was an extreme violation of the Confucian social norms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The queen's death also shocked the nation, and strong anti-Japan sentiment rose**. In 1896, young [Kim Gu](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Gu) (later one of the most important independence fighters) murdered a Japanese man, suspecting that he was one of the Japanese assassins. He wrote in his journal:\n\n>Could he ... one of \\[the killers\\]? Even if he is not, a Japanese man with a disguise and a sword can do nothing but harm to my country and people. I will revenge for my queen by killing this Japanese man.\n\nHe got a death sentence, but he escaped the prison (such a badass) and later organized many guerilla organizations.\n\nResponding to the queen's murder and also the widely unpopular \"[Short Hair Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gabo_Reform#Third_reforms)\" , the [Righteous Army](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Righteous_army) was also organized by Confucian scholars and concerned commoners\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 1897, **the king proclaimed** [**the Korean Empire**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Empire) as a symbol of independence from imperial powers, and was coronated in an [imperial altar](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hwangudan) that had been only allowed for Chinese emperors before. In a [series of reforms](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwangmu_Reform), his new cabinet legally abolished the class system, and kept collaborating with Westerners (Americans, British, missionaries, etc.) to build infrastructure. Street cars, electricity, and street lamps were introduced in the capital *Hanyang* (Seoul).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nOnly one more post is left in this series!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1667752727.0},{"title":"A 1000-year-old Viking silver treasure found in Sweden","author":"drexa24","url":"https:\/\/arkeonews.net\/1000-year-old-viking-silver-treasure-found-in-sweden\/?fbclid=IwAR1LaUvd7rmdr-HoocOxJi4zeQEGX8ShtzzoKG75clQLxngwWnQfDqFi-4g","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1667689735.0},{"title":"How mail-in voting began on Civil War battlefields","author":"novica86","url":"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/article\/how-mail-in-voting-began-on-civil-war-battlefields","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1667725839.0},{"title":"Building the Egyptian Pyramids: Economy and Construction Techniques","author":"weather-girl","url":"https:\/\/www.guardianmag.us\/2021\/03\/who-built-egyptian-pyramids-how-did.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1667713883.0},{"title":"The mysterious Viking runes found in a landlocked US state","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/travel\/article\/20221030-the-mysterious-viking-runes-found-in-a-landlocked-us-state","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1667664741.0},{"title":"Researchers unveil secrets of the largest stash of Roman coins ever found in Spain","author":"IslandChillin","url":"https:\/\/english.elpais.com\/culture\/2022-11-03\/researchers-unveil-secrets-of-the-largest-stash-of-roman-coins-ever-found-in-spain.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1667593362.0},{"title":"Hurrem Sultan: The Sultan\u2019s Concubine Who Became Queen","author":"TheMDNA","url":"https:\/\/www.thecollector.com\/hurrem-sultan-concubine-to-queen\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1667681400.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/ymt9g3\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

On top of that, they made three single-shot .22 LR guns in the 1950s.\n\nWanting to check to see if that was actually true, I managed to stumble down a rabbit hole. There were tons of threads from the early 2000s that discussed the connection, but no one seemed to be able to prove they were related. Both companies listed addresses in the same city, and they both were shown to have produced products called Powermasters. Wham-O had a series of slingshots and crossbows, and WAMO had an extremely limited run (allegedly 1 year) of .22 caliber single-shot pistols.\n\nHere's the example of what the pistol advertisement looked like: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MYGitAM](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MYGitAM)\n\nI also dug around old forum posts for people that could definitively prove the connection. Most of the old pages were dead, but one was available through Wayback Machine. It was a guy's old blog ([source](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080914100736\/http:\/\/www.airgunwriter.com\/blog\/blog.html)) where he shows a scan of an advertisement found in 1956 Science & Mechanics magazine which contains both logos on one product.\n\nThe part that I find most humorous is that despite being advertised as \"the safest firearm on the market\", this gun was incredibly dangerous to the person *holding* it. The weapon was described as being \"safe - dependable - rugged\" even though it was shoddily made. To load it, you would lock the bolt back, place a round in the chamber, then guide the bolt forward. In doing so, you also cock the striker back. Once loaded, a spring prevented the bolt from opening again. This also meant that the gun couldn't be unloaded\n\nThe other two *glaring* issues were that the gun didn't have a safety mechanism, and the bolt had a huge issue with slamming forward without the trigger having been pulled. This meant it went off for no reason, including due to being jostled.\n\nThis gun was available via mail order for $19.95 (or $29.98 now), and is now a collectors item that [rarely sells](https:\/\/www.gunauction.com\/buy\/11727965) because it's too dangerous to use (along with supply issues). So yeah, the company that sold hugely popular toys like Frisbees, Hula Hoops, and Silly String, also sold one of the most dangerous pistols that was made available to consumers through the post.\n\nEdit: A commenter pointed out the inflation calculator I used was incorrect. The pistol was $19.95 in 1956, which is $220.94 nowadays.

But they also in the context of the 60s shared certain similarities and interestingly enough there were some somewhat amusing moments between them. Which might sound unbelievable given the fact that we're talking about the Cold War here. These are just some statements they made about each other directly and indirectly that are somewhat amusing.\n\n**JFK on Castro**\n\n* Castro once was giving his typical speeches which were at once charismatic, energetic and bombastic at the same time. JFK is asking a female reporter who's met Castro about it and he states, paraphrasing 'Why does Castro always have to give these long speeches. And what do people see in them'. Then JFK says 'Who does he sleep with? I hear he doesn't even take off his boot'. Then JFK says 'Castro gives all of these long speeches but where are the dames?'. So essentially JFK thinks that Castro gives so many speeches that he forgets to take off his fatigues so he can sleep with someone.\n* There's a couple of ironies. The first is that from what is known Castro himself was a major playboy......like Kennedy himself. It almost became a major issue for him in fact where the CIA actually weaponised it for an assassination attempt. Second.....Kennedy trying to analyse and understanding the charismatic appeal of a young revolutionary at the time is......well ironic.\n\n**JFK on Che Guevara**\n\n* JFK is looking through photos of his daughter Caroline while speaking to the same female reporter who he spoke to about Castro. He isn't looking at the reporter but at the photo album. While looking at the photo album he says 'So tell me about El Che'. The reporter has also met Che and in fact interviewed him. Basically to paraphrase the reporter she said 'Well Che is charming, charismatic, cool, pragmatic, intellectual and blunt....a little like Kennedy'. The reporter notes about this conversation that when she would talk to Kennedy, he'd ask about Che, and when she'd talked to Che, he's talk about Kennedy. She also said that if they weren't political opposites, they would hit it off.  When JFK heard these descriptions he allegedly said 'Something tells me you've got the hots for Che'. The reporter is kinda floored and she says \"do you not see the photos of me arguing with him?\". And JFK states 'Yes but as any good psychologist would tell you, opposites attract'.\n* There is another occasion where JFK overhears that Che was somewhat fascinated by Jacqueline Kennedy his wife and actually said she was the one American he'd like to meet. JFK responded by saying 'Well he'll have to wait in line'. \n\n**Castro on JFK**\n\n* These are largely Castro's reactions to Kennedy's assassination. In the lead up Castro is speaking with a French reporter Jean Daniel. He is acting as a liason between him and JFK because they are in negotiations about normalising relations. Jean Daniel states that Castro said '*He still has the possibility of becoming, in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the United States, the leader who may at last understand that there can be coexistence between capitalists and socialists, even in the Americas. He would then be an even greater President than Lincoln. I know, for example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders have assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await his re-election. Personally, I consider him responsible for everything, but I will say this: he has come to understand many things over the past few months; and then too, in the last analysis, I\u2019m convinced that anyone else would be worse.\u201d Then Fidel had added with a broad and boyish grin: \u201cIf you see him again, you can tell him that I\u2019m willing to declare Goldwater my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy\u2019s re-election*!\u201d'.\n* When the assassination was taking place Castro's reaction was one where '*He came back, sat down, and repeated three times the words: \u201cEs una mala noticia.\u201d (\u201cThis is bad news.\u201d) He remained silent for a moment, awaiting another call with further news. He remarked while we waited that there was an alarmingly sizable lunatic fringe in American society and that this deed could equally well have been the work of a madman or a terrorist. Perhaps a Vietnamese? Or a member of the Ku Klux Klan? The second call came through: it was hoped they would be able to announce that the United States President was still alive, that there was hope of saving him. Fidel Castro\u2019s immediate reaction was: \u201cIf they can, he is already re-elected.\u201d He pronounced these words with satisfaction*.'\n* A somewhat amusing turn in a very morbid way was when the broadcasters were describing the details of the assassination, '*One reporter felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy was having in getting rid of her bloodstained stockings. Fidel exploded: \u201cWhat sort of a mind is this!\u201d He repeated the remark several times: \u201cWhat sort of a mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations after all. Are you like this in Europe? For us Latin Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes decency, dignity, respect. There are even street urchins who behave like kings in the face of death. Incidentally, this reminds me of something else: if you write all those things I told you yesterday against Kennedy\u2019s policy, don\u2019t use his name now; speak instead of the policy of the United States government*.\u201d'.\n\n**Che on JFK**\n\n* The closest interact Che had with Kennedy was indirectly through JFK's aide Richard Goodwin. Its at a major conference of the Americas in Uruguay in August of 1961. The Bay of Pigs happened months before. JFK's personal aide along with the Secretary of the Treasury to Uruguay had travelled their to announce what was called the Alliance for Progress. In this conference Che gives a blistering speech denouncing the Alliance for Progress. However behind the scenes Che actually seeks out Richard Goodwin, JFK's personal aide. \n* Che challenges Goodwin to a smoking competition when seeing him smoking a cigar by daring him to smoke a Cuban. Goodwin takes it up. During this meeting they had a relaxed atmosphere with Goodwin allegedly not wanting him to \"out proleterianise\" him and so they sat casually on the ground with each other. In the process Che says the famous lines \"Thank you for the Bay of Pigs, before it the revolution was tenuous, now it is stronger than ever\". Goodwin of course responds \"You're welcome, now perhaps you might invade Guatanomo\". Che of course just smiles and says never. Che then states that he actually did see the Kennedy era people as a new generation that actually wanted change but that the reforms he was proposing was too late. Then Che fascinatingly goes on to describe Cuba's problems bluntly, including what he saw as the failures of his own monetary policy(knowing full well this is JFK's personal aide). Che then gives Goodwin a gift of Cuban cigars meant for JFK from Castro with a personal message to Kennedy. Famously Kennedy sees the gift and just asks \"are they good\"? \n\nIts just fascinating that they had these somewhat \"amusing\" interactions(though indirect) while being involved in some of the most intense clashes as Cold War enemies.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1667559815.0},{"title":"Napolean and Rabbits","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/trove.nla.gov.au\/newspaper\/article\/37254325","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1667559548.0},{"title":"The locations of the Alexandrias: we all know of the one in Egypt, but Alexander founded up to 70 cities bearing his name.

JFK refused to go through with part 2 and allowed the invasion to fail.\n\nHowever major part of why Cuba won was of course because of their preparations for the operation. Now when it comes to Castro himself he of course was the leader of the country. And during the Bay of Pigs he personally commanded the Cuban army going on the battlefield himself. Che by contrast was not involved in the fighting as his forces were diverted from the battlefield by a fake mock invasion the Marines stage to split the Cuban forces.\n\nHowever in the lead up to the Bay of Pigs Che Guevara was assigned by Castro in the training of Cuba's forces as director of instruction for Cuba's armed forces. He was largely responsible for helping to form the armed forces of the new revolutionary government at the time as well as the creation of the National Revolutionary Militia, a citizens militia, that played a key role in repelling the invasion. Che along with Fabian Escalante was also important in the formation of Cuba's intelligence services. Cuba's intelligence services were of course the ones who discovered the Bay of Pigs plan.\n\nSo essentially he didn't command the operations or participate in the fighting. That was Castro. But he formed, trained, and disciplined the army and militias that went out to fight in the Bay of Pigs.

History, Edo Period foccused - What are the different ranks of Yujo? (Japanese Prostitutes)","author":"PrawnRamenIsShit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/ygr5ak\/question_japanese_history_edo_period_foccused\/","text":"Hi! I've been googling this for the past couple hours and the amount of conflicting information is astounding. I'd really appreciate some help figuring this out, as well as the actual differences between the ranks.\n\nHere's my current list (...of lists, because of the lack of consistency) of Yujo ranks from highest to lowest. Please let me know if I am close. Seems like the ranks evolved with time, so perhaps my issue is information regarding different time periods. There's also the use of Oiran, which seems to be a catch-all term for high rank Yujo, perhaps applied belatedly, or maybe not. And there's also the comon misconception that Geisha were prostitutes (which is debatable, \"they weren't supposed to be\" seems to be the realistic answer,) further muddying the waters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nList 1: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oiran#Ranks](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oiran#Ranks) Wikipedia, the most illustrious of sources.\n\n1. Tay\u016b - The Highest Rank and very rare. Didn't sell sexual services. Didn't sit in the Harimise for viewing by the public either. Had Kamuro, these young female servants. They had to be contacted indirectly through other people. \"Oiran\" seems to fit this rank too.\n2. K\u014dshi - no idea\n3. Yobidashi Tsukemawarashi - Yobidashi means \"by appointment only.\" They did'nt sit  in Harimise. As for Tsukemawarashi, it's apparently mid-level, but no  explaination why.\n4. Sancha - no idea\n5. Tsukemawarashi - no idea\n6. Zashikimochi - unsure about this. Elsewhere said they had their own room and Kamuro and which puts seem to put them higher up the ranks...but here they are at the bottom. No idea why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nList 2: [https:\/\/ceas.yale.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/Yokoyama%202016.pdf](https:\/\/ceas.yale.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/Yokoyama%202016.pdf)\n\nFrom this PDF, table 8.1 showing the ranks, prices and population for each rank. I added Tayu despite the table not showing any.\n\n1. Tayu - \"  \"\n2. Koshi - Still no idea\n3. Tsubone -  Apparently used to be a high rank, but became devalued to the point of working in \"cubicles\". The diagram in the PDF looks like pretty bad conditions, but not a cubicle.\n4. Sancha - No idea what makes them better than Jijoro.\n\n.Chusan - A high rank Sancha\n\n.Umecha - A low rank Sancha\n\n5. Jijoro - ditto\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are the 2 most consistent ranking systems I've found, with others adding or retracting various ranks, such as a Heya-Mochi who was lower than Zashiki-Moshi, but had her own room, Kashi Joro who are suspiciously similarly named to Koshi and placed at the bottom. Found those here: [https:\/\/www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org\/history\/Yujo%20(prostitute).html](https:\/\/www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org\/history\/Yujo%20(prostitute).html) and here [https:\/\/www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org\/culture\/Oiran.html](https:\/\/www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org\/culture\/Oiran.html)\n\nThere were others, where I frankensteined most of the reasoning behind the ranks from, but I can't find them anymore. Sorry.\n\nI hope I provided enough information for everyone to go through.\n\nExtra sources:\n\nhere's a wikipedia page in Japanese that seems like it would be helpful, if I could read it. [https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E9%81%8A%E5%A5%B3](https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E9%81%8A%E5%A5%B3)\n\nHere's a site with a very comprehensive list, confusing me even further after showing that a lot of these terms above might not be ranks at all. [http:\/\/www.issendai.com\/japanese-courtesans\/researching-oiran-in-japanese.html](http:\/\/www.issendai.com\/japanese-courtesans\/researching-oiran-in-japanese.html)\n\nOn the same site is a list of has ranks I haven't managed to find else where. Perhaps they are just variations, such as licenced or unlicenced, hired or in-house, etc. [http:\/\/www.issendai.com\/japanese-courtesans\/lower-ranking-prostitutes-names.html](http:\/\/www.issendai.com\/japanese-courtesans\/lower-ranking-prostitutes-names.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nHere's the same site talking about Kamuro, just because I thought it was facinating, and wanted to share [http:\/\/www.issendai.com\/japanese-courtesans\/kamuro.html](http:\/\/www.issendai.com\/japanese-courtesans\/kamuro.html)\n\nHere's someone who has drawn many types of historic japanese hairstyles. Actually very helpful in identifying various ranks of Geisha, Oiran, and the like [https:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/shotakotake\/gallery?catpath=%2F&q=nihongami+tutorial](https:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/shotakotake\/gallery?catpath=%2F&q=nihongami+tutorial)\n\nAn odd text to speech video, but actually had some neat details about Yujo such as their daily routine and such. [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Av-7UYGxXU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Av-7UYGxXU) The rest of the channel has other videos on Geisha and Oiran which are all quite good, except for the AI voice.\n\nAnd that's it.

Deepening Confucian Orthodoxy, Isolationism, and Underground Spread of Catholicism [1640s~1860s]\n\nContemporary Koreans often ask \"Why was Joseon not able to modernize itself like Japan did?\" Then the answers tend to blame a particular political figure, like *Heungson Dawongun* in the 19th century.\n\nHowever, many also view it as **a systematic failure of neo-Confucianism as a political ideology**.\n\n* As I said, **neo-Confucianism basically idealized the social norms of the ancient Chinese bronze age**, based on what was written in 2,500-year-old scripts\n   * It was indeed effective in preserving the stability of an agrarian society, and preserving the social hierarchy (landed aristocracy)\n* **Joseon became a radically neo-Confucian society in the 15th century, resulting in the lack of merchant and military class** that would have been naturally open to the Western\/modern ideas (in contrast, there was a strong merchant and military class in Edo Japan)\n\nWell, to be fair, as long as the imperial China stayed in power, Joseon's model could still work. Joseon would have stayed their **most loyal vassal state**, and the imperial China would have protected Joseon, so that Joseon would remain as an isolated, agrarian hermit kingdom**.**\n\n* That was Joseon's state model called *Sadae*. ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sadae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sadae))\n* **North Korea's Juche (self-reliance!) is a reaction** to this *Sadae. Juche* is an interesting successor of Joseon's neo-Confucianism - ***Juche*** **radically refuses the influence of any foreign empires, but its social ideal is still a \"pure,\" agrarian, self-sufficient society** not so different from what was idealized by old Confucianists. \n\nAnd the model worked again in the Japan invasion - Ming China eventually helped Joseon, and the kingdom of Joseon survived even though its population and economy got devastated (the main [royal palace](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gyeongbokgung) got destroyed and didn't get restored for 250 years) **The royal family and the landed aristocracy survived and continued their old way**. **No travel, no trades, no foreign ideas**. And it worked for the following 200 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 13. Diplomats and princes bring Western science and Christianity from China; The Crown Prince is poisoned to death by his father for that\n\n* Since the 16th century (1500s), China and Japan were exposed to Western science and Christianity by Portuguese\/Italian\/Dutch missionaries and merchants, but Korea was not\n   * No Catholic missionaries visited Korea yet. Christianity (Catholicism) was first introduced into Korea by Korean diplomats and princes returning from China\n   * It is allegedly a diplomat named [Yi Su-gwang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Su-gwang) who first introduced Christian books (written in Chinese) into Korea. He also wrote a giant [encyclopedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jibong_yuseol) \\- he was critical of the scholarly class in Joseon, and said \" there are too many sajok (scholarly class), idlers, vagrants and too few people liable for (military) service\"\n* The [Crown Prince](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crown_Prince_Sohyeon) of Joseon was a captive in Qing China for 9 years, and returned to Korea with new ideas - Western science and Christianity. His father, the king who was humiliated by Manchu, hated this and was suspicious of the Crown Prince. Soon after, **the prince was found dead in his chamber, with the signs of poisoning**\n   * The king sent three sons of the killed crown prince into exile, and never visited the crown prince's tomb\n\n\\*\\* Around this time, **the first westerners were drifted to the Korean peninsula in shipwrecks**. The first Westerner was probably this [Dutch guy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jan_Jansz_Weltevree) who got Korean name *Park Yeon* and settled with his Korean wife. He worked as a government official, and was not allowed to leave Korea.\n\n* Then another group of Dutchmen, [Hamel and his crew](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hendrick_Hamel) were drifted to the island of Jeju from Japan (Jeju is an island that has a distinct history and its own [Koreanic language](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeju_language)). It is said that when *Park Yeon* saw his fellow Dutchmen after like 20 years, he cried a lot. Hamel and his crew were sent to Seoul, and were sent around to different towns, until they eventually escaped to Japan after 13 years. Hamel was invited to many aristocrats' houses (for their curiosity), and **later Hamel's observation of the \"hermit kingdom\" was published** in Netherlands ([link](https:\/\/www.hendrick-hamel.henny-savenije.pe.kr\/home.htm))\n* I didn't read his manuscript myself, but according to this [article](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/opinion\/2020\/07\/137_169998.html), he mentioned **while Japan traded far and away, there were no foreign ships in Korea** other than a few Chinese and Japanese ones. Plus, it seems that he complained about having to eat rice only with salt and water...\n   * However, later Japanese envoys to the US made an opposite complaint. When the Japanese asked for rice, the Americans gave them rice with sugar. The Japanese were so shocked by that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 14. Orthodox faction fighting, consort Jang Hui-bin's curse\n\nThe royal family and landed aristocracy maintained their old way. Around this time Confucian political factions would be called \"*bungdang*.\" In early Joseon, the factions fought over matters of practical importance - such as land distribution. However, in late-Joseon, the faction fighting came to be centered around **the literal application of ancient Chinese family rites, and legitimacy disputes**.\n\n\\*\\* Typically, a faction fighting would go this way\n\n* A faction disapproves the legitimacy of the incumbent king (e.g. \"he's born from a concubine or a court maiden\"; \"he shouldn't have acted hat way, that was against the Confucian norm)\n   * As people suggested in the previous post, the plot of Kingdom on Netflix is based on this\n* Or, a faction accuses another faction that they're traitors and they're secretly trying to enthrone another prince (often a half-brother)\n* => triggers the insecurity of the incumbent king\n* => purges\/kills\/expels the accused prince and all members of an affiliated faction (often their families and relatives, too)\n* => Now the winning faction becomes dominant in court. **Then they split again over the most insignificant, petty issue that they can't agree upon**\n* => Repeat\n\nThe most amazing example of this, well-known to Koreans, was decades of faction fighting over **whether a deceased king's young stepmother should wear a funeral robe for three-years, or one-year.** This debate led to another faction fighting, then another faction fighting.\n\nThis crazy court in-fighting was entangled with **three generations of royal family drama**. Fortunately, someone else had written an incredibly rich account of the timeline of the faction fighting on Reddit, so I will add a link here.\n\n[Check this!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badhistory\/comments\/2sg2tf\/this_is_literally_the_worst_thing_i_have_ever\/)\n\nI think this comment succinctly summarized the situation\n\n>It's like **the equivalent of Keynesian and neo-liberal economists regularly accusing each other of treasonous conspiracies, burning each others books, and convincing the government to murder each other**.\n\nThis [**link**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Northerners_(Korean_political_faction)) also shows a nice overview of the crazy complex genealogy of late-Joseon factions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\[\\*\\*Notable event: **Consort Jang Hui-bin (*****Joseon*****'s Ann Boleyn?) and her shamanic curse\\]**\n\n* This is the most dramatized event during this period\n* King [Sukjong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sukjong_of_Joseon) actively engaged in faction fighting, changing dominant factions (by bloody purges) depending on his mood\n   * When his **beloved concubine** [**Jang Hui-bin**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royal_Noble_Consort_Huibin_Jang) **gave birth to a son**, he was ecstatic and tried to name the boy an heir apparent. The dominant faction opposed to it because she's a concubine, and **the king got infuriated and purged (tortured, killed, beheaded, sent in exile) the dominant faction members**. Hui-bin got promoted to the rank of queen, and the existing queen got demoted.\n   * Then the king took another concubine, and some complex court infighting unfolded. The new concubine gave birth to another son. The original queen got reinstated. **The king's love interest changed**, and he gave less attention to Jang and her son. He betrayed her and her affiliated faction\n   * For the following 5 years, **Jang Hui-bin used shamanistic ritual to curse the reinstated queen. Some scary witchcraft. The queen indeed died.**\n      * I heard that the voodoo dolls were excavated until quite recently around royal places in Seoul\n   * Eventually, **Jang Hui-bin got executed by the order of her husband. Poison bowl**. Gone.\n      * She's one of the most dramatized figures in k period drama, although she might not be well-known to the outside world\n   * However, after her death, her son became the next king. Another large-scale purge ensued. The new king died early, though.\n\n\\*\\* it is interesting how much the fate of a political faction depended on whether a particular queen from their faction (clans) produced a male heir or not. I find that this was a typical issue not just in Joseon, but also throughout the Chinese history within the Confucian patrilineal\/polygamy system\n\n* **A queen's fate utterly depended upon whether she gives birth to a son or not**. And infant mortality rate was extremely high in this era. In the pre-modern time women had no control over that, so **these women desperately relied on all types of superstitions**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 15. Yeongjo successfully reigns; his Crown Prince Sado develops psychosis, and gets publicly executed by his father\n\n[Yeongjo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeongjo_of_Joseon) is enthroned in 1724, and leads Joseon's relatively stable 18th century. His mother was a concubine of low birth, so it is commonly said that he always had huge status anxiety about that\n\nHe had an acute political talent and charisma, and minimized the faction fighting under his policy called \"Grand Harmony\" (*tangpyeong*). He established \"universal\" and fair military service tax, and [sent secret royal inspector](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Secret_royal_inspector)s to provinces to inspect corruptions at the local level. [Park Mun-su](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Mun-su) is a legendary secret royal inspector, and any Korean person would recognize the phrase \"Secret royal inspector here!\" (*Amhaeng-eosa chuldu-yo*)\n\nUnder the stability, the economy revived and Seoul became the little center of commerce\n\n* However, it should be noted that Joseon Korea still did not engage in any large-scale international trades. Commerce was still at a primitive level, compared to Japan and China. Joseon was a **deeply conservative isolationist hermit kingdom**, and its capital was smaller and poorer than Edo (Tokyo's old name) or Beijing. Plus, Japan and China might have actively obstructed Joseon from developing its own trading network\n   * \\* Korean history textbooks commonly say that \"early capitalism was budding\u201d but I'm not sure how true this was. Joseon still had a strictly isolationist, agriculture-based economy\n* That said, aristocrats in Seoul enjoyed imports from Qing China, and \"Qing style\" material goods became popular.\n\nDespite his achievement, unfortunately Yeongjo is most famous for **the dramatic public execution of his mentally ill son,** Crown Prince Sado. The Crown Prince started showing signs of violence and mental illness at the age of 22. He killed eunuchs and maidens, walked around the palace with their severed heads, and corpses and injured people had to be carried from the palace every day. He had paranoia about his father's scolding, thunders, and bizarrely, dressing. He started using immense amount of clothing to get dressed, because if something went slightly wrong in the dressing process, he would freak out and start the process all over again. When servants made a slight error, he hurt them or even killed them.\n\n* His symptoms are well-described in the diaries of his wife (written in the Korean script) - [Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Memoirs_of_Lady_Hyegyeong). Her descriptions are very detailed, and she made her own theories of why he came to be that way. It's perhaps because of his upbringing, his father's constant scolding and extremely high expectation, and\/or the curse of Jang Hui-bin (Sado grew up in the pavilion where Jang had resided). She said otherwise he was a decent and handsome man. **Modern scholars suggest that he might have had schizophrenia**\n* The father fiercely hated his son, and never forgave his weaknesses. Ultimately, on a hot July day, **the king ordered the mad crown prince to climb into a wooden rice chest in the middle of the court. After screaming for his father's mercy for eight days, the prince died**. The Crown Prince Sado is one of the two examples of madness in the Joseon royal family, with the other being *Yeonsan* (section 6)\n* There's a recent film about it that was popular among Koreans [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The\\_Throne\\_(film)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Throne_(film)) (2015)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 16. The rise of Pragmatist School (Silhak) and Catholicism\n\n* \"Pragmatist School\" is my translation because no one reading this would remember the word *Silhak*... there was a small yet growing number of Confucian scholars who deviated from and **criticized the dogmatism** of Joseon neo-Confucianism.\n   * Starting from a diplomat Yi Su-gwang's [encyclopedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jibong_yuseol) work, the school slowly grew during the 17th and 18th century. The scholars who belonged to this school **commonly traveled Qing China, and saw how the Qing economy benefited from commerce and Western knowledge**\n   * Many of the pragmatists still focused on land reform -- a traditional, Confucian way of addressing economic issues. However, there were more radical thinkers who thought that Joseon needed to break out of isolation and engage more in international trades. [Park Ji-won](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bak_Jiwon_(born_1737)), a satirical writer, was one of them. His travelogue [The Jehol Diary](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Jehol_Diary) extensively discussed the topic\n   * [A scholar](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yu_Deuk-gong) was influenced by Qing's evidence-based historiography (which was again influenced by Western science), and identified forgotten histories of the Korean peninsula (*Balhae)*\n   * A [scientific minded scholar](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Daeyong) was deeply impressed by the Copernican theory\n      * There's a folklore that when he talked about his theory (\"the earth revolves around the sun!\"), other Confucian scholars just said \"huh huh that's interesting\" and paid no attention to it\n   * They were mostly **underdogs and outsiders** of the scholar-aristocrat class, mainly based in the capital Seoul. For example, [Yi Ik](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Ik_(born_1681)) **saw his brother beaten to death involved in the Consort Jang's witchcraft scandal** (section 14), and lost interest in court politics\n   * However, the school grew substantially by the late 18th century, and some of them would be hired by the king Jeongjo (will be explained later)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Famously, **Korea is the only country where Christianity (Catholicism) spread by locals indigenously** without the presence of Western missionaries. Catholicism was first introduced by a Korean diplomat returning from Qing China in the 17th century. **He brought a bible translated in classical Chinese**. It was understood as part of \"Western knowledge.\" Knowledge about the Christian teachings slowly spread among dissasified scholar-aristocrats and merchants in Seoul and Northern provinces (Pyongyang).\n   * About 100 years later, **still without the presence of any Western missionaries, the first Catholic prayer-house was founded in 1784 in Seoul** by [Yi Seung-hun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Seung-hun), a diplomat who had been baptized in Beijing. He brought Christian books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts to Korea.\n   * By the time when an ordained Chinese priest arrived Korea in 1795, **the underground Church had grown to over 4000 members**, with many of them being nobles and aristocrats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 17. The mad crown prince Sado's son, Jeongjo, is enthroned. He hires the Pragmatists and partially explores Western knowledge\n\n* Despite his father's madness and tragic death (section 14-3), [Jeongjo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeongjo_of_Joseon) grew up to be a smart boy and became the next king.\n* He's remembered as the most progressive king in *Joseon* history, and still beloved and lamented by many Koreans. He:\n   * **hired the Pragmatist school scholars**, mostly notably [Jeong Yak-yong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeong_Yak-yong)\n      * Jeong famously built the [Hwaseong Fortress](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hwaseong_Fortress) using **Western technologies**\n      * Many pragmatist school scholars were also **affiliated with Catholicism -** [**Jeong's brother**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeong_Yak-jong) **was central to the Catholic community in Seoul**, and he translated catechism in the Korean script to spread the beliefs to more people. He would be martyred in the persecution that would follow the death of Jeongjo\n      * Jeong himself had denounced Catholicism, because he was deep down a Confucian scholar and was repelled by the Catholics' refusal to do ancestor spirit rituals. This would save his life later.\n      * During the first Catholic persecution (1801), Jeong was spared his life and sent into exile - famously in a Southwestern county *Gangjin*. He would spend 18 years of his life in exile. He was extremely prolific there and wrote 500 volumes and 14,000 pages of books - on classics, politics, ethics, economy, natural sciences, medicine, music, and even fishery. **His book on the ethics of governors**, *Mokminsimseo*, is still popular and read by modern Koreans\n      * However, he was confined by the constraints of his time - some of his arguments were still deeply retro-oriented and Confucian. For example, he argued for **the restoration of** [**the well-field system**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Well-field_system)**, an idealized land distribution principle that had existed in the 9th century BC China**, instead of promoting commerce and international trades\n   * The king established a new royal library named [Gyujanggak](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kyujanggak) to promote knowledge (which still exists as part of the prestigious [Seoul National University](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seoul_National_University))\n   * The king also **allowed for a free market in Seoul** (before that, only a few state-endorsed merchants could operate)\n\n\\*\\* However, the king had a conservative side too, and banned \"new styles of writing\" in documents, only allowing classical Chinese style. He also banned the import of many Western books.\n\n* He knew that he had many conservative enemies who opposed to his reforms. He **built a group of private royal bodyguards, and had his servants taste his food first to test for poisons**. An advisor named [Hong Guk-young](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Guk-yeong) is known to have helped him a lot.\n* However, despite all the efforts, **he was found dead mysteriously** at the age of 47. He was previously healthy, so many people suspected poisoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 18. Andong Kim clan takes power and provides queens for three puppet kings; Rampant corruption destabilizes the society; China loses the Opium Wars\n\n* Jeongjo died (or got assissinated) in 1800. His 10-year-old son got enthroned, and his grandmother (Jeongjo's stepmother) took power as the [queen dowager](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Queen_Jeongsun). She was Jeongjo's stepmother who was only a few years older than him; she was 15 year old when she married 60-year-old Yeongjo\n* She was a deeply conservative 50-year old woman, and her faction was against Catholicism. They **launched an all-out attack on Catholics** \\- which was understood as a bizarre foreign cult, that refused to do ancestor spirit rituals, and thus denied the teachings of Confucian classics and the divinity of the royal family (in their cosmology, the royal ancestors are kind of at the top of the pantheon of the ancestors of clans)\n   * In the [persescution of 1801](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Catholic_Persecution_of_1801), several hundred core members of the Christian community in Seoul were executed, including many nobles\n* Then power was transmitted to the young boy king's [father-in-law](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Jo-sun_(politician)), who was the leading figure of the queen dowager's faction. He married his daughter to the boy king\n* Andong Kim clan means \"Kim clan originating from the town of Andong\" (many modern Koreans still belong to [such a clan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bon-gwan)). Under the king's father-in-law's ladership, the clan took power, and took many important positions in the court\n   * **Rampant corruption** ensued - the civil service exam degenerated, and exam takers started **bribing the clan members** for government\/provincial positions. Those who bribed for their position became extremely exploitative of their land and peasants\n   * Tax system also degenerated - the practice of \"taxing yellow mouth\" (taxing newborns) and \"taxing white skulls\" (taxing dead people) emerged. Overall, the **tax on peasant population became extremely high, which caused peasants to run away from their land and disappear** from the state registry. This exacerbated the tax burden on the remaining people\n* The clan enthroned three puppet kings, and it is famous that the [last of them](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cheoljong_of_Joseon) was a distant relative who was living as a poor peasant in an island.\n   * Context: The puppet king's grandfather was a half-brother of King Jeongjo, but the family was **executed and sent in exile because his wife and daughter-in-law were Catholic.** The puppet king grew up as a poor peasant in an island with limited education. When the royal envoy appeared at his village, he was petrified. He did not have any real power in his reign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\* China: The opium crisis and opium war**\n\n* In this period, t[he opium crisis in China](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_opium_in_China) was started by the British East India Company (gosh, they were drug lords! The graph in the wiki article reminds me of Narcos so much) and China lost the historic Opium War.\n* This would turn out to be the most important watershed moments in the East Asian history\n   * Famously, after watching China losing the two Opium Wars, **a coup happened in Japan that would lead to a complete reform of the government and Westernization** ([Meiji Restoration](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meiji_Restoration))\n   * Why did Korea fail to do the same? Modern Koreans are still haunted by the question. However, realistically, I think it is important to note that Japan and Korea in the 19th century were **not on an equal footing**. Japan and Korea's path had been diverged since the time of Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Japan had been engaging in international trades \"far and away\" for hundreds of years, ranging from the Moluccas in Indonesia to the Sea of Okhotsk (far east Russia). Japan already had a relatively good understanding of Europe, European languages (mainly through [Dutch studies](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rangaku)), and their institutions.\n   * Korea was a completely **isolated society - it was a closed world**. Koreans had been **prohibited from leaving the country** except for a few diplomats. It was **not that different from modern-day North Korea**. International trades were extremely limited except for occasional trades with China and Japan at a designated place (Korea-Manchu border, and a small Japanese district in Busan).\n   * As long as the Confucian cosmic order was alive, Koreans were content to live and die in their ancient homeland, living in their old ways inspired by the ancient classics. However, things were falling apart, and Koreans were only slowly making sense of what was going on around their small world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Foreign ships appear**\n   * By this time, more foreign forces started visiting Qing China - from the UK, France, US, Russia, etc - and they **frequented the Korean shore** as well. Some of them sacked Korean coastal cities. Famously, some French sailors dug up ancient Korean royal tombs\n   * Isolationist Joseon Korea just reacted by shooting the ships with cannons\n* **An apocalyptic sentiment** emerged nationwide\n   * Major social unrest was unfolding. A [major rebellion](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Gyeong-Rae) occurred in a Northern province around Pyongyang.\n      * The ancient city of Pyongyang was always a bit rebellious in the late-Joseon era, and it was becoming the Christian center of the nation at this point\n* [**Andrew Kim Taegon**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_Kim_Taegon) **became the first ordained Korean Catholic priest**. I remember his story that he crossed the Korea-China ice-covered river border on foot in an extremely cold weather, and walked all the way down to Macau (near Hong Kong) to attend a seminary there. Back in Joseon Korea, he preached, got arrested, and executed at the age of 25 with thousands of other Catholics.\n   * It is said that the spectators were impressed by his poise and serenity at his execution. They asked \"What about the faith made him like that?\" His last word was:\n\n>This is my last hour of life, listen to me attentively: if I have held communication with foreigners, it has been for my religion and my God. It is for Him that I die. My immortal life is on the point of beginning. Become Christians if you wish to be happy after death, because God has eternal chastisements in store for those who have refused to know Him\n\n* **About 10,000 Korean Catholics were killed in this period.** [**103 of them**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Martyrs) **were canonized as martyrs** by the Catholic church later \n* However, Catholicism was still a fringe foreign belief - it was called \"Western learning,\" and many Koreans were deeply suspicious of that. Soon, an **indigenous new religious movement called \"**[**Eastern Learning**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donghak)**\"** would catalyze a large-scale peasant rebellion that swept the Southern part of Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome minor 19th century figures:\n\n\\*\\* [Kim Satgat](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/news\/opinon\/2012\/11\/162_92963.html) (\"Kim the Hat\") was a legendary bard\/minstrel who wandered around the peninsula\n\n\\*\\* [Bongi Kim Seondal](https:\/\/folkency.nfm.go.kr\/en\/topic\/detail\/5454): A legendary swindler\/con man from Pyongyang who famously sold free water to people from [Daedong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taedong_River) River\n\n\\*\\* \"Chusa\" [Kim Jeong-hui](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gim_Jeong-hui): a calligrapher and pragmatist scholar famous for his very distinct calligraphy style\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn interesting fact:\n\n* According to [a scholar](https:\/\/koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/opinion\/2019\/11\/739_261434.html), Korea probably had the greatest concentration of genealogical publications (Jokbo) of any country. Jokbos in early Joseon era included the names of women and female descendants, but in the late Joseon era, it would be **exclusively about male lines (patrilinearity)**.\n* When the social system started collapsing in the late-Joseon era, Jokbo was also bought and sold. **A large number of peasants who were wealthy enough bought Jokbo from fallen scholar-aristocrats**, and claimed ancestry to nobles and kings. ([link](https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/nation-world\/world\/in-s-korea-a-town-of-kims-and-an-unusual-shared-history\/)) So even though a Korean person you know has an extensive family genealogy book, there's a good chance that it was bought multiple generations ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nTo be continued --\n\nIf you are interested in the vernacular literature that emerged in this period, check [Part 5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/y9fy6x\/joseon_the_predecessor_of_modern_koreas\/) that I posted earlier.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1666912836.0},{"title":"Enheduanna: The World's First Named Author","author":"SirBettington","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/culture\/article\/20221025-enheduanna-the-worlds-first-named-author","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1666819107.0},{"title":"Detailing a Disastrous Autumn Day in Ancient Italy","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/today.uconn.edu\/2022\/09\/detailing-a-disastrous-autumn-day-in-ancient-italy\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1666864351.0},{"title":"Fall of the East India Company","author":"Vailhem","url":"https:\/\/www.worldhistory.org\/article\/2096\/fall-of-the-east-india-company\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1666844135.0},{"title":"Narration about Dunkirk and the events sorrounding Operation Dynamo","author":"pier4r","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zr4MdqXbk7c","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1666879409.0},{"title":"Archaeologists unearth two Viking Age swords in burial ground - HeritageDaily - Archaeology News","author":"GullyShotta","url":"https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/10\/archaeologists-unearth-two-viking-age-swords-in-burial-ground\/145069?amp","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1666744770.0},{"title":"Lost French Fort Caroline (1564), not where we thought?","author":"foovancleef","url":"https:\/\/medcraveonline.com\/JHAAS\/JHAAS-07-00249.pdf","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1666827398.0},{"title":"Roman observation tower uncovered in ancient city of Volubilis - HeritageDaily - Archaeology News","author":"GullyShotta","url":"https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/10\/roman-observation-tower-uncovered-in-ancient-city-of-volubilis\/145066?amp","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1666761231.0},{"title":"Ancient Europe and Ukraine","author":"colormeincoconut","url":"https:\/\/www.dailykos.com\/stories\/2022\/10\/16\/2129283\/-Ancient-Europe-and-Ukraine","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1666825530.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/ydv58q\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

One of the most complete accounts of these practices is offered by the aforementioned Jer\u00f3nimo Benzoni, when he describes the struggle of the indians of Suerre, who were joined by the Huetares of Tayutic to destroy the group of Spaniards led by Governor Diego Guti\u00e9rrez in 1544:\n\n\"with frightful cries and noise, making a racket with horns and drums, all painted red and black, with plumage and gold jewelry around their necks and other trappings, as is customary in all these nations of the Indies when they go to war... We were soon killed with rocks and batons, and run through with spears made of palm wood... We passed through more than twenty-five Indians, and they were all lords, who each carried only one spear in their hand and a cloak thrown over one shoulder, and they had no paint like the others\u2026 we found out that they had cut off and taken the head, feet, and hands of the Governor \\[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez\\], as well as of two black men, and all the others had been stripped down and thrown into a stream, and that everything had been taken except the oil and the soap\". (In L. Fernandez 1889, 89-90).\n\nThe following observations are inferred from the previous text:\n\n1. shouting and musical instruments (wind and percussion) accompanied the fighters,\n\n2. they got painted and decorated (according to Benzoni, it was general),\n\n3. they used rocks, batons and spears as offensive weapons,\n\n4. a hierarchical boss-soldier order was established, marked by external behaviors,\n\n5. the winners cut off the head and other members of the body as a trophy (see details on page 65).\n\nIn 1563, the chieftain of Tayutic communicated to Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado that the chieftain of Suerre \u00abhas the clothes and weapons of Diego Guti\u00e9rrez and of his people\u00bb (V\u00e1zquez de Coronado 1964, 61), so that not only did they cut limbs, but that they also took precious objects. In this particular case, the weapons of the Spaniards must have caused some kind of admiration among the indians of Suerre, since they took them and kept them for almost twenty years. But the Huetares also did the same with the Spaniards they killed in the Atirro rebellion in 1564:\n\n\\[Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado\\] was received with armed hands and the insignias of the said dead men (M. Peralta 1883, 337).\n\nFinally, and according to the documentary sources, the Huetar women didn't accompany the men to war, as the Coctu indian women did, in the South Pacific of Costa Rica. Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado recounts that these indians had such a custom, \u00abfor which they are called by the G\u00fcetares and other nations, Biritecas\u00bb (V\u00e1zquez de Coronado 1964, 50), In the opinion of E. Ibarra (personal conversation) the situation of Coctu was particular, because they were kept in large and enclosed rooms since they were threatened. Hence the women had to help.\n\n**Source:**\n\nQuesada-Pacheco, M. (1996). Los huetares: historia, lengua, etnograf\u00eda y tradici\u00f3n oral, pp. 58.

Japan invades - the Imjin War (1592-1598) [link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598))\n\nThen finally the unified Japan invaded, led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (a well-known name to most Koreans). Japan first asked for \"a free passage for Japanese troops en route to China,\" Joseon refused, and Japan soon invaded.\n\n* For the reasons mentioned above, Japan had a stronger and larger market economy, soldiers with a lot more military experience, and muskets imported from the Portuguese.\n* As I look back, what's kind of sobering is that **Joseon Korea did not have a well-trained army and a cadre of military generals. Many war heroes were outsiders and underdogs**. Deeply entrenched in Confucian orthodoxy and dependency on Ming China, Joseon did not care to maintain a functioning military. There was no way Joseon Korea could win the war alone.\n\nArriving at the Southeastern port city of Busan in May 1592, **the Japanese army took the entire Southeastern province in a week, and the king of Joseon fled from Seoul in 2 weeks** from the invasion. In 2 weeks from that, Japan took control of Seoul and the Northern city Pyongyang.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the war went into a stalemate because of the three factors:\n\n(a) Ming China's help ([Wanli Emperor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wanli_Emperor)). China sent a small army in August, and a large one in the following year\n\n* Keeping it short because this part is not so much discussed in Korea...\n\n(b) **Admiral Yi Sun-sin's 23 unexpected naval victories and control of the Southern sea**. Having no prior naval experience, [Yi Sun-sin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Sun-sin) (a secondary naval commander back then in a Southwestern province of Korea) **won unexpected victories at sea with ridiculously few resources and support**. He remained undefeated until his death. His victories at sea **significantly disrupted the supply lines of Japan.**\n\n* In the beginning of the war, he found himself in a situation where all the other commanders were killed or fleeing, and many coastal villages were pillaged and abandoned. His soldiers began to flee too, but he arrested and beheaded the escapees, and displayed their heads for discipline. By July, **his fleet was comprised of 24 warships, 15 small warships, and 46 fishing boats**.\n* Japan was paying all their attention to the Northern front, and the Japanese navy in the Southern sea was just sailing along the coastline, busying themselves with looting and raping\n   * Yi exchanged fires with some unexpecting Japanese ships in small battles, and identified their strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Korean warships were speedier and had a long artillery range, but the Japanese ships were big, carried many soldiers, and the soldiers had strength in on-board combats with their guns and battlefield experiences. Realizing that, Yi **built the famous** [**turtle ships**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turtle_ship) **with a roof covered in iron spikes** (to prevent enemies' boarding)\n   * He typically used a tactic of luring the Japanese fleet with a small, speedy Korean ship, and encircling the fleet with the Korean warships with long artillery ranges. He also later mastered the use of the sea currents, straits and knowledge of the sea\n   * [Battle of Hansan Island](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598)#Battle_of_Hansan_Island): **using a strait, \"crane wing formation\" and turtle ships, he destroyed 59 Japanese ships and captured 12, while not losing a single Korean ship**. After this and another battle, Yi was promoted to the Naval Commander of the Three Provinces\n* However, the hero was not properly acknowledged and welcomed by the king of Joseon. Framed by a double agent's [plot](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Sun-sin#Japanese_double-agent_plot), **he was beaten and tortured by the order of his king almost to death**. He was replaced by incompetent [Won Gyun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Won_Gyun) and was demoted to the rank of an infantry soldier\n   * In a disastrous battle led by Won Gyun, the Korean fleet of 150 warships that Yi had been carefully building were destroyed; only 13 warships survived\n* After the disaster, the king and court officials hurriedly pardoned and reinstated Yi as the Naval Commander. **While recovering from the torture by the king, Yi led another legendary battle with his 13 surviving ships defeating the Japanese fleet of 333 ships, destroying 31 of them, without losing a single Korean ship**. ([Battle of Myeongnyang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Myeongnyang))\n* Sadly, **the hero died in the last naval battle in this war**, in which Korea won an absolute victory and destroyed half of a large Japanese fleet of 500 ships. He was fatally shot while commanding on the deck. He famously uttered to his son and his nephew:\n   * \"**Do not announce my death**\" because the war was at its height. For the remainder of the battle, his nephew wore his armor and continued to beat the war drum\n\n\\*\\* A lot of details of his life and his thought processes are described in his meticulous **war diary** ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nanjung\\_ilgi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nanjung_ilgi))\n\n\\*\\* [Nakan-eupseong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Naganeupseong) is one of the coastal villages that might preserve the appearance of the coastal villages at the time of this war.\n\n\\*\\* Yi Sun-shin is also known for his battlefield use of folk traditions. Take a look at how he used [Ganggangsullae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ganggangsullae#Feature_of_Korea's_traditional_society) (ancient circle dance of women) and [Kites](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/nation\/2018\/03\/362_103566.html) in battles\n\n\\*\\* Now, a big statue of Yi Sun-sin is standing in a central plaza of Seoul, [Gwanghwamun plaza](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwanghwamun_Plaza)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(c) Guerilla warfare\n\n* [Grand Master Seosan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hyujeong) and [Grand Master Samyeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yujeong) are two famous Buddhist monks who led guerrilla wars against the Japanese force. They left a lot of folklore about their divine power to change the weather, etc. After the war, Samyeong was sent to Japan as an envoy, and rescued thousands of Koreans who had been taken prisoner.\n* [Gwon Yul](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwon_Yul) and [Gwak Jae-woo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwak_Jae-u) are two famous general\/guerilla leaders from the scholarly class. Gwon Yul is known for his [Battle of Haengju](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Haengju), where he defeated 30,000 Japanese soldiers with his 2,800 Korean troops\n* [Nongae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nongae) was a gisaeng (courtesan), who killed a Japanese general by falling off a cliff with him (uhh... in a kind of Squid Game way in retrospect)\n\n\\*\\* I later heard that Japan was puzzled about why the peasants and defeated villages in Korea still resisted so much, because the Japanese peasants would just submit to a new ruler. But to ethnic Koreans, Japan was a completely foreign land and culture after 1,000 years of separation (plus Koreans had dismissed them as \"dwarfs\" \"savages\" \"pirates\" for a long time). Koreans also viewed the Japanese samurai-style atrocities as barbaric and horrendous. This all contributed to anti-Japan patriotism\n\nThe Japanese ultimately ended the war in 1598 after the death of the shogun, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and returned to Japan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[the legacy of the war\\]\n\n* Devastation of the economy - famine, epidemics, and poverty combined with the Little Ice Age in the 17th century\n* **Atrocities**: the Japanese violence was so gory and brutal, Koreans viewed them as \"monsters\" and \"ghosts.\" A famous story is that **the Japanese sliced the noses of killed soldiers and civilians as war trophies, and were rewarded based on the nose-count.** This story is true, and there's still a monument called [Ear Mound](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mimizuka) in Japan that **enshrines the severed noses of 38,000 Koreans and 30,000 Chinese**. The original name was Nose Mound, but it would later be changed to Ear Mound, **because the Japanese thought that Nose Mound sounded too horrible**\n   * [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Siege\\_of\\_Jinju\\_(1593)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Siege_of_Jinju_(1593)) all the soldiers and civilians (tens of thousands) were killed in the southeastern coastal city of Jinju\n* In the midst of the massacres and plunders, the Japanese kept [Korean ceramic artisans alive](https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/ceramic-wars-hideyoshis-japan-kidnaps-koreans-195725) and took them to Japan. It is said that the ceramic technology was \"stolen\" - but according to some records, some artisans would not want to return to Joseon Korea because artisans and craftsmen were better treated in Japan (which had a thriving market economy) vs. Korea (Confucian orthodox)\n* **Crops of the Americas**\n   * In terms of the material culture, something very interesting happened -- during the war, **chili peppers and tobacco were introduced to the Korean peninsula** (via Japan via the Portuguese) even though Koreans had no idea about the origin of the crops. Some ethnic Koreans were captured and sold as slaves by the Portuguese merchants, far and away\n      * **the spicy kimchi** as we know now evolved after this point. Before the chili peppers, kimchi was white and not spicy\n   * Tobacco was quickly popularized after the war. Interestingly, \"**smoking tiger**\" became a common motif in Korean folk traditions. ([link for a folk painting](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/OOqsFPw)) A Korean equivalent of \"long, long time ago\" is \"In a time when tigers used to smoke\"\n* Ming China's fall\n   * I heard that this war partially accelerated the decline of the Ming Empire, which would soon conquered by the Manchu (Jurchen)-led Qing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 11. Manchu Qing rises; a pragmatic king of Joseon gets dethroned by a conservative neo-Confucian faction\n\n* While the king Seonjo was hiding from the war, one of his sons, [**Gwanghae**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwanghaegun_of_Joseon)**, stayed during the war, set up a branch court, and fought battles**. He succeeded his father as the next king. He led quite nice domestic reforms to reconstruct the economy after the devastation. For example\n   * Redistributed land to people\n   * *Daedong* law - collecting taxes only in rice. This would make it easier for people to pay taxes\n   * *Hopae* ID - made people to carry an ID called [hopae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hopae) so that the state can track its (taxable) population again (after many villages were abandoned and emptied)\n   * Compiling a [medical book](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dongui_Bogam) (led by a [royal chief physician](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heo_Jun))\n* Despite this, he was **largely unsupported** by many politicians, scholars, and aristocrats **because he was not the first-born son and he was born from a concubine**.\n   * Writing this, at this point I feel personally irritated lol. Why weren't all these fundies killed by Japan\n* He lost support for two reasons (1) *Gwanghae* had a young half-brother born from a legitimate queen. It is commonly thought that *Gwanghae* didn't want to kill him, but the faction that supported him did. The young boy was eventually sent into exile and executed\n   * It seems that [The mother of the killed young boy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Queen_Inmok) firmly believed that the king actively persecuted her son... her court maiden wrote an extensive diary about this event. It was written in the Korean script, which was widely used among women and commoners at this point\n* (2) The Imjin war accelerated the decline of Ming China (Han Chinese), and **Manchu Qing Empire was rising in power.** *Gwanghae* was a practical ruler, and he tried to maintain friendly relationships with the Manchus. This upset Ming and the dogmatic Confucian scholars in Korea.\n   * *Gwanghae* was still forced to [send a troop](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gang_Hong-rip) to Manchuria to help the Ming dynasty. Joseon lost 2\/3 of their troop in this doomed military operation\n* Ultimately, a \"ultra-conservative\" [political faction](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Westerners_(Korean_political_faction)) that opposed to him made a coup, and dethroned the king\n   * He's often considered a victim of the crazy faction fighting that was worsening since the Phase 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 12. Qing Invasion (The Byeongja war): the King of Joseon surrenders and gives nine bows to the Manchu Emperor\n\n* Joseon politics was a mess. After the coup, a new king Injo was enthroned, but one of the coup members was dissatisfied with his reward, made another coup, and [occupied Seoul](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Injo_of_Joseon#Yi_Gwal_Rebellion). The economy was still devastated and an external threat (Manchu) was growing, but the aristocrats were only obsessed with court infighting.\n* The ultra-conservative faction that took power abandoned pragmatism, and antagonized Manchu (\"**because they're barbarians\"**)\n   * Manchu was a new name for Jurchen, a nomadic group in Manchuria (right north of the Korean peninsula) that had long interacted with Koreans. Koreans always had despised them as barbarians\n   * But Manchus didn't hate Joseon Korea. They even shared a [holy mountain](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paektu_Mountain)\n* However, the conservative Joseon nobles eventually upset the rising Manchu empire. Qing eventually invaded Korea (it was before Qing conquered the entire China), and drove the fleeing king of Joseon into *Namhan Mountain Fortress*. Qing brought 100,000 soldiers - while Joseon could mobilize only a few thousands from its devastated economy\n   * there's a [novel titled *Namhan Mountain Fortress* ](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Namhansanseong-Korean-Kim-Hoon\/dp\/8956253536)which was popular in Korea\n* In a siege, running out of food and supplies, the king of Joseon finally **surrendered, and ceremoniously bowed to the Qing Emperor nine times**. Joseon became Qing's vassal state, and the first and second sons of the Joseon king would be sent to China as captives\n\n\\*\\* A general [Im Gyeongeop](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Im_Gyeong-eop) beheaded one of the Manchu generals, and later went to China to help restore the Ming Empire\n\n* many people of Joseon thought that it was virtuous to be loyal to Ming, the legitimate preserver of Confucianism.

The rise of vernacular literature\n\nDespite the invention of the Korean alphabet in the 15th century, the male scholar-aristocrats still used classical Chinese to make poems and prose. Their poems in classical Chinese tend to be formulaic - talking about loyalty to the king, Confucian values, the same motif of pine trees and bamboos were used excessively\n\n* Evergreen pine trees and bamboos were the symbols of unchanging loyalty. Plum flowers, orchids, and chrysanthemum were also common motifs that represented Confucian values\n* In the previous *Silla* and *Goryeo* period there were poems written in [modified Chinese script](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idu_script) (modified for denoting Korean grammars, similar to what Japanese did) and they tended to be more interesting thematically (see my previous [posts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/xdnht8\/goryeo_koreas_medieval_kingdom_918_1392_stories\/))\n   * However, as Joseon turned fundamentally neo-Confucian, the scholars censored un-Confucian themes such as \"infatuation between men and women (*nam-nyeo sang-yeol ji-sa*)\"\n\nHowever, around the 18th century, with the wider spread of the Korean alphabet (*hangeul*), Koreans started writing poems and novels ([sijo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sijo)) in vernacular Korean. **People in lower social classes and women started generating a lot of vernacular poems and prose**. They were a lot less formulaic in their themes, and contained many indigenous elements such as vulgar slangs and onomatopoeia (well Korean and Japanese languages are known for their exceptionally large inventories of onomatopoeia)\n\n* [Kim Man-jung](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Man-jung), a scholar-aristocrat and novelist in the 17th century, once said that \"**the stories told by woodworkers and laundry maidens are a lot more valuable** than [yangban](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yangban)'s cookie-cutter poems\" (\\* yangban = scholar-aristocrats)\n\nThe vernacular literature was both influenced by and critical of Confucianism: (a) it was heavily influenced by the dominant Confucian ideology (filial piety, women's chastity, etc) but (b) was **satirical of the orthodoxy and pretentiousness of the scholar-aristocrats**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of the vernacular literature was very earthy and satirical, as a reaction to the Confucian orthodox of the ruling class. **Together with the oppressive Confucian and patriarchal culture (**[**link**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/wzqxuu\/womens_oppression_in_joseon_era\/)**), the earthy and satirical humor of folk culture would characterize the late Joseon culture**. A lot of what we know as \"traditional Korean culture\" have come from this culture of late Joseon era.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] Poem\/[Sijo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sijo)\n\nStandard sijo (poem) follows this formula: 3 lines, 45 syllables (3\/4 4\/4 3\/4 4\/4 3\/5\/4\/3). The first line introduces the theme, the second line expands it, and the third line twists it and impresses the audience by intoducing an unexpected theme\n\n* However, a new type of sijo called \"*saseol sijo*\" broke the formula, typically by extending the second line of the poem, adding verbose, bubbly and often comical phrases\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater sijo's common themes: **Deep, unchanging love**\n\n>May my love become an alder tree of Kumsong in Hoeyang, and I am an arrowroot vine:  \n>  \n>Like a spider\u2019s web around a butterfly, the vine goes round the tree, tightly this way, tightly that, wrongly loosened, properly wound, bound, then loosened from down below, all the way to the top, tightly winding round and round, without a single gap, and unchanging, day and night, it\u2019s coiled around, twisting.  \n>  \n>Though, in the heart of winter, we bear wind, rain, snow, and frost. Could we ever be apart?  \n>  \n>(*Yi Chong-bo*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater sijo's common themes: **Women's suffering**\n\n>Mother-in-law, do not stamp on the kitchen floor for hatred of your daughter-in-law!  \n>  \n>Was she payment for a debt, was she bought for a price? Father-in-law, severe as a sprig from the rotting stump of a chestnut tree; mother-in-law, shriveled as sun-baked cattle dung; sister-in-law, sharp as a new gimlet poking from a straw bag woven three years ago, and \u2014 like a poor crop on a field that\u2019s made for planting good grain, having borne a son like a bright yellow cucumber flower, who has the bloody flux,  \n>  \n>Daughter-in-law, like the bindweed on a fertile field: Why do they hate her so?  \n>  \n>(Source: [link](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=DK_Edn9hkx8C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=%22A+toad+grabbed+a+fly+in+its+mouth+and+hopped+on+top+of+a+compost+pile%22&source=bl&ots=ECUESMyoD9&sig=ACfU3U1BB64r-CoZYK3yOaJDgwveuS-Zdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih0t6K-8v6AhV0rIkEHaONAoEQ6AF6BAgFEAM#v=onepage&q=%22A%20toad%20grabbed%20a%20fly%20in%20its%20mouth%20and%20hopped%20on%20top%20of%20a%20compost%20pile%22&f=false) \\- The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Korean Poetry)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater sijo's common themes: **Earthy humor; life as commoners**\n\n>One night in Andong, after a tour of back-alley wine shops,  \n>  \n>As I staggered, head spinning, down the narrow, paddy-field path,  \n>  \n>The two pigs grunted, grunted, So, you! Home at last!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A toad grabbed a fly in its mouth and hopped on top of a compost pile.  \n>  \n>It looked across the mountain opposite, and saw a peregrine falcon hovering in flight. The toad shuddered, started, tumbled from atop the compost pile  \n>  \n>Fortunately the toad was exceptionally agile, otherwise severe contusions would have been its lot.  \n>  \n>(\\*\\* Can be interpreted as a commoner avoiding nobles or authorities like a toad hiding from a falcon. In Seoul's old district, there's still a [back-alley so narrow that horses couldn't enter](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/news\/culture\/2013\/07\/320_42052.html) \\- commoners used it to avoid nobles)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[2\\] Pansori\n\nAn oral tradition\/stories sung by (often traveling) professional singers (a genre called [Pansori](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pansori)) became a national culture. The most popular stories have **strong Confucian-influenced themes (filial piety, women's chastity, rewards to good deeds)** and now commonly taught to Korean children through children's books\n\n* The song of Simcheong:\n   * the story of a filial daughter named Sim Cheong. **She offers herself as a sacrifice for 300 sacks of rice needed for her blind father to regain his eyesight**. Sailors bought her as a sacrifice to \"appease\" the dragon king in the sea. However, the dragon king is moved by her virtue, and sends her back in a lotus flower, to be shown to the emperor of China. She is chosen as his new wife, and she becomes the empress of China.\n   * In order to find her father, she hosts a feast for the blind. He shows up, but when Sim Cheong cries \"Father!\", he denies and insists that his daughter is dead. Sim Cheong somehow demonstrates that she is indeed his daughter (I forgot this part), they reunite in tears and live happily ever after.\n* The song of Chunhyang:\n   * the story of the virtuous daughter of a gisaeng (courtesan) who stayed **loyal and chaste** for her scholarly-aristocrat lover, who had left for a civil service exam. In the meantime, **a greedy magistrate orders her to \"serve\" him, but she refuses and is put into prison**, wearing [a sort of pillory](https:\/\/9gag.com\/gag\/adL2Egj). However, her lover comes back as a high official with a king's mission, punishes the corrupt magistrate and rescues her. They live happily ever after.\n      * \\*\\* She's 16 years old (\"*2x8 youth*\") and often portrayed as riding a swing, standing on it. Swinging was a way young, noble women could see the outside world, because they were confined within the walls of their residence\n* The song of Heungbu:\n   * the story of a poor brother\/rich brother.  A greedy, rich brother is very mean to his poor brother (and his family). One day a poor brother heals an injured swallow. The swallow repays his kindness by bringing a magical gourd seed. Huge gourds grow on the thatch of his humble house. When they cut the gourds open, gold, silver, and jewels pour out from the gourds. The rich brother tries to replicate it, but he gets punished\n* The song of Sugung (the Sea Palace):\n   * the dragon king is sick, and his illness can be cured by taking a rabbit's liver. The dragon king sends a terrapin (small turtle) to find and bring a rabbit from the earth. A rabbit is taken to the sea palace, but soon it realizes that it will be slaughtered. The rabbit tricks the dragon king, and escapes, ridiculing the dumb king. This song is particularly filled with earthy and farcical humor, and lengthy verbal imitations of animals\n* The song of Jeokbyeok (Red Wall):\n   * About the famous Chiense battle of Red Wall. The basic story is from the Romance of the (Chinese) Three Kingdoms (which is an oral tradition in China itself), but this Korean version focuses a lot more on **ridiculing kings and nobles** who cause wars\n* Plus there are some less-known songs such as \"a story of pheasant husband and wife\" (the husband is pathetic and demands the wife not to remarry after his death, but she ignores him)\n   * and a shamanic saga Baridegi (**the seventh princess of a king is abandoned because she's a daughter and unwanted**, but she goes into the underworld to find a cure for her father's treatment)\n* There are also a lot of theater pieces (village ground theaters) - [with masks](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthlingPorn\/comments\/x54mfv\/a_scene_from_bongsan_talchum_a_traditional_korean\/).

I don't know if Korean lepers really did that, but this stereotype was so common that I still remember seeing on TV the image of a leper wandering in vast, yellow grassfields looking for a human baby\n   * The Japanese later built a [leper colony](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sorokdo)\/concentration camp for lepers on a Southwestern island. Lots of abuses happened there, and the colony still exists there.\n* There were **all-male troupes** called [Namsadang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Namsadang) that performed theater arts, acrobatics, drumming, and village ritual music (which is a bit shamanic and trance-inducing: [Pungmul](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pungmul)). There was often a male actor who played a female role (similar to Japan), and **homosexuality** was common in those troupes. A popular movie about it: [The King and the Clown](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_King_and_the_Clown)\n* **Singing beggars** \\- There was a [tradition](https:\/\/world.kbs.co.kr\/service\/contents_view.htm?lang=e&menu_cate=culture&id=&board_seq=12630&page=7&board_code=trendkorea) of homeless performers tapping on empty tins with spoons and singing and dancing at the doors of rich people.

Unfortunately, the practice of **foot-binding** also spread during this time. \n\n* Being frugal was considered a virtue and many nobles wore white or less decorated clothes \n* **Imperial civil service examination**, which had emerged in Sui Dynasty first, now became established \n* As an reaction to An Lushan Rebellion, the military generals and military class were despised and suppressed - **scholarly virtues** were praised highly \n\nThen: \n\n* [Jurchen Jin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jin_dynasty_(1115%E2%80%931234)) emerges: Jurchen, a Tungusic ethnic group from far-east Siberia (Manchuria), invaded the Northern China and took the territory (They're the direct ancestors of Manchus later) \n   * [Yue Fei](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yue_Fei) is a popular Han Chinese hero who fought against Jurchen Jin \n* Song, weakened by its scholarly and anti-military policies, **was pushed away into the Southern territory of China**. The Southern China was still **covered by tropical forests**, but during this time, lots of Han Chinese farmers went Southwards and developed the Southern China into a network of irrigated rice paddies. The land was wet and very fertile. Then, **gradually, the Southern China started becoming the economic center of China**. \n   * And many ethnic minorities would go further south, many into Southeast Asia. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Yuan dynasty** \\[1271-1368 AD\\]: \n\n* Then Mongol came.

Famously, [Hongwu Emperor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hongwu_Emperor), a peasant from an impoverished family in the central part of China, led an army to expel Mongols, and founded a new dynasty ([Heaven's Mandate](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mandate_of_Heaven)). \n\nDuring Ming era, the **national Han Chinese folk culture** emerged that still survives in China. The Romance of Three Kingdoms and other folk literature such as [the Journey to the West](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Journey_to_the_West) was written in this period. Christianity comes.\n\n* **Christian missionaries** and European merchants started coming to China during this period. The Portuguese had a trading post in the [Moluccas](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maluku_Islands) and [Macau](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Macau), and traded spice. **Silver** started flooding into China \n* Famously, [Zheng He](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zheng_He), an eunuch, commanded a fleet and **explored India and East Africa**, but soon such expeditions were banned. Ming China took an isolationist position. \n* **The Ming territory was confined to the territory of ethnic Han Chinese**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Qing dynasty** \\[1636 - 1912 AD\\]: Then, the pendulum swung again, and **Manchu (former Jurchen) troops came** to conquer China. \n\n* Qing was an interesting period - **the imperial family, who were ethnic Manchus, used** [**Manchu scripts**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manchu_alphabet) as the language of court. The imperial clan was called [Aisin-Gioro](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/House_of_Aisin-Gioro). \n* **The Qing had a vast territory**, mainly through tributary relationships with five ethnic groups - **Manchus, Han Chinese, Mongols, Tibetans, and Hui (Muslims)**. Later, this would develop into a policy called [Five Races Under One Union](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Five_Races_Under_One_Union) in the 20th century. A highly political topic now. \n   * [Kangxi emperor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kangxi_Emperor) is often praised for his effective reign \n* The Manchu imperial family strived to maintain their ethnic identity.

Early prosperity [15th century]\n\nJoseon in the first 100 years was a well-functioning, thriving medieval kingdom. Most Koreans have heard of this rhyme \"*Tae-Jung-Tae-Se-Mun-Dan-Se*\" which is the first syllables of the names of the first 7 kings. I classify the first 9 kings (including -*Ye-Sung*) in the Phase 1, \"Early prosperity\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. Foundation myths ([Taejo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taejo_of_Joseon))\n\nI explained how the *Goryeo-Joseon* transition happened [in my previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/xdnht8\/goryeo_koreas_medieval_kingdom_918_1392_stories\/). The general Yi Seong-gye, who was enthroned by the Confucian ruling class, would be the founder and progenitor of the 500 years of Joseon dynasty (or Yi dynasty).\n\nUnlike his descendants (kings) who would be forever tormented with endless Confucian lectures from scholars and bureaucratic works, Yi was basically a military man. He grew up in a Northern military post in Korea that was directly controlled by Mongols. I don't know if he spoke some Mongolian, but at least he had close non-Korean friends such as an ethnic Tungusic (Jurchen) [Lee Ji-ran](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chonghae_Yi_clan).\n\nHe also had a close Buddhist monk advisor, [Muhak](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muhak). There's many myths about him\n\n* The monk was a geomancer, and located the site for the new capital, *Han-yang*, which is an old name for modern-day Seoul. **Seoul is famously located based on Feng Shui principles** \\- \"With back to the mountain (to the North) and facing the water (to the South)\"\n* Another [legend](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=rJCboIyd__4C&pg=PA318&lpg=PA318&dq=muhak+rafter&source=bl&ots=XJaCE3hkPg&sig=ACfU3U0l-b_4TZh47vj7uhS4fKRfEQ6-Lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGy7bF25_6AhXPg4kEHR4iArMQ6AF6BAgiEAM#v=onepage&q=muhak%20rafter&f=false): Yi once had a peculiar dream. He entered an old rundown house. The floor creaked, the pillars shook, and the roof was about to cave in. Yi escaped right as the house collapsed with a boom. When he escaped, there were three rafters placed across his back.\n   * According to the legend, after hearing this, the **Buddhist monk prophesied** that that Yi was going to be the founder of a new dynasty. \"The old house is the *Goryeo* dynasty, and you escaped with three rafters in the shape that resembles the Chinese character **\"king\" (\u738b, wang)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* In China, royalty and auspiciousness was symbolized by **\"dragons\" and \"jade.\"** Joseon Korea followed the same symbolism. King's face was referred to as \"dragon face,\" king's robe was \"dragon robe,\" king's belt was a \"jade belt,\" king's seals was \"jade seals,\" and king's voice was \"jade voice.\" Finding and possessing the Jade seal was a big deal because it was thought that the seal somehow finds its way to a ruler who has \"the Heaven's Mandate\" uh.... like One Ring in LOTR, lol.\n\n* Many Koreans are familiar with these trivia from period k-dramas. There's a nice recent one titled \"[Six Flying Dragons](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Six_Flying_Dragons)\" (2015) (the title used medieval Korean words). I grew up watching \"[Tears of the Dragon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tears_of_the_Dragon_(TV_series))\" (1996) that was set in the same period\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. The founder's 5th son kills his half-brothers and takes the throne ([Taejong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taejong_of_Joseon))\n\nThe aforementioned k-drama \"[Six Flying Dragons](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Six_Flying_Dragons)\" (2015) and \"[Tears of the Dragon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tears_of_the_Dragon_(TV_series))\" (1996) are based on this story. The founder's [5th son](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taejong_of_Joseon), *Yi Bang-won*, was **the most ambitious son** who had helped his father on many military campaigns and operations - including the assassination of a famous [Goryeo loyalist](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeong_Mong-ju) (it is said that the blood stain is still visible on a bridge in present-day North Korea)\n\nHowever, the founder's close [neo-Confucian advisor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeong_Do-jeon) insisted that the youngest (8th) son be the crown prince, so that Joseon will become **an ideal kingdom that is led by a scholarly council, not by absolute monarchy**. This infuriated the 5th son.\n\nThen the wife of the founder king died (a mother of the 8th son, step-mother to the 5th son). When the father was in the mourning, the **5th son broke into the palace with his soldiers and killed the advisor and two of his half-brothers**, including the young crown prince.\n\nThe two murdered princes were born from the founder king's favorite wife, who had just died and he was mourning for. In shock and disgust, the founder king abdicated, and secluded himself in the Northern border city [Hamheung](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hamhung) which was close to his childhood hometown.\n\n* **Disappearing messengers**: It is well-known that the 5th son tried to send messengers to his father many times - for forgiveness, for his endorsement, and most importantly, the Jade seal. However, those messengers **never returned** \\- **the father shot all of them with his arrows**.\n   * Originated from this, there's a Korean idiom \"Hamheung messenger\" to refer to people who are very slow to return or reply.\n\nThe 5th son first enthroned his [eldest brother](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeongjong_of_Joseon) to appease his father. But soon the puppet king abdicated (he was terrified), and the 5th son became the next king.\n\nThere are different versions of stories about how the father and son reconciled. In a[ story](https:\/\/thetalkingcupboard.com\/portfolio\/king-taejo-and-the-disappearing-messengers\/), the father was finally persuaded by his trusted Buddhist monk advisor to see his son again. The son (now the king) went out of his way to welcome his father, building tents on the way\n\n* However, upon seeing the son, the father's anger flared again and he shot his son with his arrow with the intention to kill him. But the son successfully defended himself with a shield. After this violent encounter, the father finally released his anger and they reconciled\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Taejong's eldest son chooses freedom over the throne; his brother, the third son, becomes Sejong the Great and creates the Korean alphabets ([Sejong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sejong_the_Great))\n\nTaejong (the 5th son)'s eldest son [Yangnyeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grand_Prince_Yangnyeong), as opposed to his father, **had little interest in the throne.** Folklore says that he was a **\"chill guy\" who loved hunting, calligraphy, and women**. He was a rebellious teen - he ran away from the palace, and hung out with commoners and *gisaeng*s (geisha\/courtesan). Perhaps watching his father killing his uncles affected his attitude.\n\nHe had a younger brother (the third son of *Taejong), Chung-nyeong*, who loved reading and studying. One day, the young smart boy (the third son) got a cold. The king saw his boy reading a book in his sickbed. That day the king realized that *Chung-nyeong* had a better quality as the next king for his Confucian kingdom than the crown prince.\n\nSome say that the crown prince **misbehaved so that his father and court officials would take away his crown he didn't want**. True or not, they indeed stripped him of the crown and gave it to the king's smart third son.\n\n* *Yangnyeong*, who voluntarily gave up his crown, had an amazing life ever since - traveling around, enjoying his life, and still being connected to all the influential politicians at that time. According to their genealogy, the first President of South Korea is a direct descendant of this guy.\n\nAnd **the smart third son became the famous King Sejong**, who Koreans often refer to as [Sejong the Great](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sejong_the_Great).\n\n* His most famous achievement is **the creation of the Korean alphabet,** [Hangul](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hangul). The Korean ruling class used the classical Chinese for writing, but it was extremely difficult to write Korean sounds and native words using the logograms.\n   * He gave the task to a group of young talented scholars, including [Shin Suk-ju](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Suk-ju). There's a story about him - one day Shin stayed up night working hard, and fell asleep on the table in his court office. The next morning, Shin realized that someone put a robe on him, and it was the king's robe. He felt ecstatic about this, and bowed towards the royal chamber multiple times in the cold morning air.\n   * Hangul is a **phonetic alphabet and very easy for commoners to learn** (it also has a reputation of being easy for foreign learners). The idea of a phonetic alphabet was not something new because Koreans had already been exposed to Mongolic scripts, but the shape and rules of the alphabets were **completely indigenous**.\n   * The aristocrats hated this new alphabet, and dismissed it as a writing system for low class. However, it slowly spread to the commoners and, particularly, women. By the late Joseon period, **Korean vernacular literature would flourish**. (section 15)\n   * Contemporary Koreans take great pride in the alphabet - commonly referred to as \"the most scientific alphabet in the world,\" lol. I don't know if it's true but it's a great alphabet.\n* Famous books he compiled:\n   * Introduction to the new script: \"[The Correct\/Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hunminjeongeum)\"\n   * First poetry book written in the new alphabet: [Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yongbieocheonga)\n   * Literature book \"Songs of the Moon Shining on a Thousand Rivers\"\n   * A book about Buddhism \"Episodes from the Life of Buddha\"\n      * This is ironic because he also suppressed Buddhism and banned monks to enter the capital\n   * Farming guideline for commoners: \"[Straight Talk on Farming](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nongsa_jikseol)\"\n\n\\*\\* There's a mythology\/fantasy novels written by a Korean scholar at this time (Tales of Geumo) [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geumo\\_Sinhwa](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geumo_Sinhwa). In this early Joseon period, you still see the strong influence of Buddhist mysticism on Korean culture. Many of the stories are about **a man falling in love with a female ghost or fairy from a distant past.** Uhh this oddly sounds k-drama!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Famous people:\n   * [Jang Youngsil](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jang_Yeong-sil): **a court slave who was promoted to be the chief court engineer**. He was an engineering genius and built sundials, water clocks, rain measurement, printing press, astronomical instruments, etc. Unfortunately, a [litter](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Litter_(vehicle)#Korea) he built for the king broke down, and he was expelled from the court (despite the king's opposition)\n   * [Hwang Hee](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hwang_Hui): a politician who was the highest royal minister for 18 years. He's known to have **lived in a very humble house, and was a \"good neighborhood grandpa\" to the children in his neighborhood**. He was a perfect Confucian [ideal man](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Junzi)\n   * [Choi Mu-seon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Choe_Museon): a military engineer who figured out how to produce gunpowder locally\n   * [Yi Jongmu](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Jongmu): a military general who subdued Japanese pirates from Tsushima island (the nearest Japanese island to Korea. You can see the Korean city of Busan from Tsushima)\n* Less known fun facts\n   * It's known that he was a tall and big man, and he had 11 wives and 25 children\n   * **One of his daughters-in-law was lesbian** and had an affair with two court maidens. When it was caught, the poor Bong Sunbin got expelled and honor-killed by her own family ([https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/4s8ect\/whatever\\_happened\\_to\\_bong\\_sunbin\\_joseon\\_koreas\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/4s8ect\/whatever_happened_to_bong_sunbin_joseon_koreas\/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Sejong the Great's second son kills a boy king (uncle kills his nephew) and takes the throne ([Sejo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sejo_of_Joseon))\n\nSejong's eldest son died early, and his 12-year-old eldest son was enthroned. Throughout the Chinese history that had adopted the **agnatic primogeniture** early on, this was a recurring problem and normally didn't end well\n\nI wouldn't go deep into the details here, but in a nutshell, Sejong's second son (known as \"Grand Prince Suyang\"), **the boy king's 38-year-old** [**uncle**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sejo_of_Joseon)**, made a coup** and exiled the boy king. Later, the poor boy was ordered to take poison and die.\n\n* **Bestowal of poison** was a common way to execute a noble - you see that trope in period k-drama all the time. The thick, black liquid that resembles Chinese herbal medicine normally comes in a porcelain bowl. What was actually in that liquid is unclear.\n* A court official named [Han Myeong-hoe](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Han_Myeong-hoe) contributed to the coup the most. As a reward, his daughters married the new king's princes.\n\n=> **The coup hurt the neo-Confucian ideal of preserving proper social norms** (and thus the harmony of the world). This would sow the seeds of political factions and legitimacy disputes, which would forever plague the Joseon politics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5. [Seongjong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seongjong_of_Joseon) successfully reigns for 20 years \/ bans the remarriage of widows and executes \"unchaste\" women\n\n* After the king Sejo's death, his eldest surviving son succeeded him, but he died in a year. After that, the guy's nephew (king Sejo's eldest grandson) succeeded him - Seongjong.\n* He's the last king in the period I titled as \"early prosperity.\" He was an ideal Confucian ruler. He lived long, cared about his kingdom, and tried to promote the Confucian ideology\n   * It is said that he used to disguise as a common noble and come out of his palace at night, to see the commoners' lives with his eyes\n   * He also finished the compilation of code of law ([State Code](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gyeongguk_daejeon))\n   * the centralization of the governance of local counties was almost completed\n* During his reign, women's situation significantly deteriorated, though\n   * The Joseon regime had gradually been stripping various women's rights, and this time, the king enacted the \"**widow remarriage ban**.\" A [woman](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Guji) in a royal clan committed suicide when she was caught living with her slave after being widowed.\n   * Eo-u-dong, a **famous** [**courtesan, dancer, and poet**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uhwudong) **from a noble family, got executed** for  with being \"unchaste\" with multiple men\n* He obtained **his crown prince from his concubine, who was executed for her jealousy** later on\n   * She was 2nd rank concubine, which was quite high. If you watch k period drama, you will be familiar with the complex rank system in the royal harem. After she gave birth to the crown prince, she was promoted to the rank of queen\n   * She was jealous of other concubines - **one night, she clawed her husband, leaving visible scratch marks on his sacred \"dragon face.\"** The King tried to conceal the injury, but his mother, Queen Dowager Insu, discovered it and ordered the queen to be deposed and sent into exile\n   * **The neo-Confucian court officials petitioned for her death** for her grave sin. She was ordered to take poison - in deadly bitterness, **she vomited blood on a cloth, and gave it to her mother, asking her to give it to her son (crown prince) later on**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The History of Joseon \n\n# Phase 2. The Cycles of Literati Purges [16th century]\n\nAfter the deposed queen's ominous death, one of the biggest soap opera moments in Joseon history would take place. This would start the cycles of literati purges, which would characterize the Joseon history ever since\n\nOverall, it was a period when **the initial neo-Confucian idealism was constantly frustrated by human nature, emotions, irrationality of monarchs, and the systematic problem** of the Confucian succession system\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 6. The Deposed Queen Yun's son becomes the king, learns the truth of his birth, takes bloody revenge on the Confucian scholars, and turns the Royal Confucian Academy into a brothel\n\n[Yeonsan-gun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeonsangun_of_Joseon), the next king, would not receive his temple name (as a revered king) because he would be overthrown as a tyrant. Young Yeonsan did not know this though. He grew up believing that his mother was a normal queen, the third wife of his father\n\nHe was an intelligent man, but showed early signs of his violent side by killing his tutor. He soon learned about who was his real biological mother, and got very emotional about that.\n\nHe wanted to restore her title and honor. However, the neo-Confucian court officials (that belonged to a more **orthodox faction) opposed to it** (often depicted as group-chanting \"It is not as it should be, Your Majesty\" in k dramas)\n\nGreatly frustrated by this, when a rival faction accused the orthodox faction of something minor, the king ordered the execution of many of the faction members. ([The First Literati Purge](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_literati_purges#First_literati_purge_of_1498))\n\nThen a man approached the king with the details of his mother's execution, and **showed him the cloth with her vomited blood on it**. This is one of the most dramatized moments in Joseon period  drama - Yeonsan became extremely upset and destabilized.\n\n**A bloodbath ensued** \\- he beat to death two of his father's concubines, pushed his grandmother to death, and executed many court officials. He beheaded the corpses of dead court officials. He also executed innocent court officials for the crime of \"not having done anything to save his mother\" ([The Second Literati Purge](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_literati_purges#Second_literati_purge_of_1504))\n\nAfter the killing spree, he **closed the** [**Royal Confucian academy**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sungkyunkwan)**, and turned it into his personal brothel** with young women taken from all provinces. He killed anyone who dared to say anything - he ordered his ministers to wear a sign that read:\n\n>A mouth is a door that brings in disaster; a tongue is a sword that cuts off a head. A body will be in peace as long as its mouth is closed and its tongue is deep within\n\nWhen the chief eunuch dared to tell him to behave better, **he killed him and cut off his limbs by himself** (at this point he went complete psycho). He also punished the eunuch's relatives down to the [7th degree](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nine_familial_exterminations)\n\nAfter 9 years of tyranny, court officials finally [launched a coup](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jungjong_coup), deposed him, and sent him into exile. He died two months later (potentially killed). His favorite concubine [Jang Nok-su](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jang_Nok-su), who often enabled and encouraged his violence, was also executed (she's another common figure in k drama).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* Another article about him: [Tales from the past: Joseon's Caligula](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/opinion\/2020\/08\/721_290739.html)\n\n\\*\\* He was a psycho, but I find it interesting that the degeneration of the Confucian orthodoxy was started by an unjustly murdered woman's son\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 7. The tyrant's half-brother is enthroned; a young, popular neo-Confucian orthodox scholar attempts a reform; the king, blinded by jealousy, betrays him and thwarts the reform\n\nThe neo-Confucian [orthodox faction](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sarim) took power after the coup. [Jo Gwang-jo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jo_Gwang-jo), a young, energetic reformist, attempted a complete reform of the country according to the Confucian ideal - (a) strengthening the dominance of the Confucian ideology on local levels (b) **land reform** to distribute land more equally (c) inspecting bribes and corruption thoroughly\n\nThe reform attempts led by the orthodox faction upset the \"[old merit](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hungu_(Korean_political_faction))\" faction, though - they were those who supported a powerful adult over a boy king in the section 4. **The orthodox faction viewed the killing of the boy king as an unjustifiable, un-Confucian action.**\n\n* because the boy king, who didn't show any merit, had the oh-so-holy divine blood as the eldest son of the eldest son of... yeah. **The divinity of the unbroken patrilineal lineage** of royals and clans is so central to Confucianism, if you don't know that, you don't understand many traditional East Asian societies. **Only paternal blood matters**. Did Confucius provide a reason why? No, he would just say it was just the way in the ancient Zhou dynasty, the Golden Ages\n   * I'm criticizing this because I'm critical of the Korean society that still teaches its patriarchal values as \"tradition.\" Confucian values are still taught in 1st-grader ethics classes, I remember. **A lot of social norms Koreans are taught as (holy) \"tradition\" came from the Chinese bronze age, many of which were explicitly written in a very specific set of ancient scripts**, which was blindly upheld to the letter in Joseon period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, now there was faction fighting and legitimacy disputes. The orthodox faction attacked the privilege of the old merit faction.\n\nJo was very idealistic and uncompromising, and was vastly popular among local Confucian scholars in provinces. However, the old merit faction started framing him that he was planning to be a king himself.\n\n* A famous story:\n   * The old merits (conservatives) used honey to write \"Ju (\u8d70) Cho (\u8096) will be King\" **on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars would leave behind the same words** \\- so that it would look like a **supernatural sign**. When \u8d70 and \u8096 are put together, they form the character \u8d99 (Jo), the reformist's family name.\n\nThe king started getting increasingly anxious about Jo's popularity. After a series of events ([detail](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_literati_purges#Third_literati_purge_of_1519)), without telling anyone else, **the king secretly asked the \"old merits\" leaders to kill Jo. Overnight**, they arrested Jo and seven others for treason, they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial.\n\nBut with the War Minister's objection, the execution was delayed until the following morning and the treason was discussed in the cabinet meeting. **The entire court was shocked that Jo was arrested and the king wanted to execute him**. Many of the officials protested (in k-drama, again, they would group-chant \"It is not as it should be, Your Majesty\") - 150 Royal academy students stormed the palace to protest. However, this even more upset the king.\n\nJo never believed that the king truly betrayed him, and the king commuted the death sentence to exile. However, a month later, he reinstated the death sentence. Before drinking poison, Jo wrote a death poem declaring his loyalty and bowed four times toward the palace.\n\nThis whole event is called the [Third Literati Purge](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_literati_purges#Third_literati_purge_of_1519) (1519). It was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to implement the neo-Confucian ideal in the land of Joseon\\*\\*.\\*\\* **Joseon politics would soon degenerate into power struggles among king's in-laws and relatives**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* I'd also like to point out that an ideal neo-Confucian society (which, again, was based on a 2,500-year-old ancient Zhou social norms) was never fulfilled throughout the Chinese history, where the idea originated from. After 200\\~300 years at the maximum, any Chinese dynasty would degenerate into power struggles among [consort kins](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Consort_kin) and eunuch groups, partially because of the **systematic problems in the agnatic primogeniture and harem system**. When a 8 year old boy becomes a monarch instead of a 35 year old adult, there was usually a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 8. A 12-year-old boy king succeeds the throne; his mother's brother takes power\n\nAfter the section 7, a new king was enthroned but he died quickly, and his 12-year-old son succeeded the throne. His mother became the Queen Regent; soon, her brother [Yoon Won-hyung](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yun_Won-hyeong) took power.\n\nThis might be the point when **the neo-Confucian ideal started getting really degenerated** \\- a pattern that's observed in the Chinese history over and over.\n\nYoon turned into a corrupt tyrant, and massive political in-fights, framing, purges, and massacres ensued. Yoon killed his relatives and many of his opponents.\n\nI wouldn't go into details because it is very complicated and not well-known among the Korean public. You can get into details here: [The Fourth Literati Purge](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_literati_purges#Fourth_literati_purge_of_1545)\n\nAfter the chaos of the four literati purges, many neo-Confucian scholars left the court politics - including a revered scholar [Yi Hwang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Hwang). He was famous for his cosmic theory of li (reason) and qi (energy) as two forces that shape the universe.\n\n* Now he's venerated by being on 1,000 won (1 dollar) banknote. I don't know why all these neo-Confucian scholars are on South Korean banknotes, even though Confucianism stopped being the state ideology\n\nWhen Yoon fell from his power, he commited suicide with his mildly famous second wife [Jeong Nan-jeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeong_Nan-jeong)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* [Hwang Jini](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hwang_Jini) is a famous gisaeng (geisha) and poet who lived in the time of the section 7 and 8\n\n\\*\\* There's a famous pair of pranksters\/high court officials called *Oseong and Haneum*. Most Koreans recognize the names - one story I remember is that *Oseong (or Haneum)*'s parents were upset about his prank, and ordered him to count all the beans piled in their yard. However, clever *Oseong* figured out how to use multiplication. He counted the beans using a bowl and multiplication, finished the task quickly and went out to play\n\n* The actual pranks of the pair are... spicier and weirder than I knew. The pair also had the age gap of about 10 years [https:\/\/folkency.nfm.go.kr\/en\/topic\/detail\/5920](https:\/\/folkency.nfm.go.kr\/en\/topic\/detail\/5920)\n\n\\*\\* There's famous literary siblings (sister and brother) [Heo Nanseolheon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heo_Nanseolheon) \/ [Heo Gyun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heo_Gyun). Nanseolheon (sister) had a literary talent that was recognized by her brother and male relatives. However, **after she got married, her poems got darker, emotional, and more empathetic with women's sufferings** at the time. According to her brother's records, she was in an unhappy marriage and died at the age of 27.\n\n\\*\\* [Han Seok-bong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Han_Seok-bong) is a famous calligrapher. Most Koreans recognize the name and associate it with the following story: He was talented in calligraphy from the young age, but his family was very poor and couldn't afford the caligraphy tools (ink, inkstick, and inkstone). He practiced on rocks with mountain water. His mother sold rice cakes to support the family. One day, she turned off candlelights at night, and told her son \"practice your calligraphy while I slice rice cakes.\" He practiced in darkness, which improved his skill further.\n\n* A bit similar to the story from ancient China about [Mencius' mother](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/roomfordebate\/2011\/01\/13\/is-extreme-parenting-effective\/what-mencius-mother-sought), famous for moving three times to **find an ideal neighborhood to educate her son**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 9. The largest Literati Purge kills 1,000 court officials and scholars right before the invasion of Japan\n\n**Over time, the scale of literati purges was snowballing**. After the section 8, the Neo-Confucian orthodox faction split into so-called \"Easterners\" and \"Westerners\" - those who opposed to having a new king's brother-in-law (who was a scholar himself) in the court, and those who supported him.\n\nAn Easterner went back to his hometown and formed a secret society. It spread across the Southwest province, the historically discriminated former territory of *Baekje* (see my previous [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/x89pzd\/koreas_three_kingdom_period_and_unified_silla\/))\n\nSoon there was a conspiracy that he was plotting a rebellion. This conspiracy snowballed, and it ultimately resulted in the bloodiest literati purge in Joseon politics. Over 1,000 officials and scholars (Easterners) were executed and expelled\n\n**While everyone was paying attention to this crazy infighting, a real threat was growing overseas - Japan**.\n\n* While China, Korea, and many parts of the world suffered from the expansion of Mongols in the 13th century, Japan remained intact (thanks to [Kamikaze](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kamikaze_(typhoon)), storms that swept Mongol ships). By the time of the end of the 16th century, the unified Japan had developed stronger military, economic, and commercial power compared to Joseon Korea. **They also had muskets** from the trades with the Portuguese.\n* [Yi I](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_I), a famous scholar in the 16th century (who's on 5,000 won banknote now), had famously claimed that Joseon needed to train [100,000 soldiers](https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Yi_I) in case Japan would invade Joseon. This was rejected by other court officials.\n   * \\* Interestingly, his famous mother [Shin Saimdang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Saimdang) \\- painter and writer - is now on 50,000 won banknote lol. She had an exceptional education unlike other women, and moved back and forth between her husband's home and her birth family's home on the beautiful eastern coast ([Ojukheon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ojukheon)), unlike other women. She was an intelligent and wise mother, and her son Yi I deeply loved and admired her.\n* A diplomatic mission called [Tongsinsa](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseon_Tongsinsa#15th%E2%80%9316th_century_diplomatic_ventures) was sent to Japan to congratulate the unification of Japan, and do some intelligence.

Neo-Confucianism\n\nBefore going through stories, I'd like to discuss how neo-Confucianism transformed the Joseon society, which is still an important substratum in today's modern Korean societies.\n\n**What's Confucianism?**\n\n* A common answer to this question is that it is an ancient Chinese belief system that emphasizes interpersonal ethics and morality. However, this common understanding does not take into account a fundamental fact that it particularly emphasized **the social norms of the ancient Zhou** (1,046\\~771 BC before division) society. In other words, in a fundamental sense, it was a **\"retro\" sort of ideology that idealized an ancient, agrarian society**.\n   * In the midst of the chaos of Spring and Autumn (770\\~476 BC) and Warring States period (476\\~221 BC) in China, it seems that there was a common sentiment of **nostalgia towards an idyllic, distant past**, symbolized by two mythical emperors [Yao](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emperor_Yao) and [Shun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emperor_Shun), the same way Greeks were nostalgic about a mythical Golden Age.\n      * However, different schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn period had different attitudes towards the mythical, idealized past. [Legalism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)), which was a dominant school of thought during the Warring States in China, made it clear that the Golden Ages would rarely ever come again because humans are flawed. Legalist [Han Fei](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Han_Fei) said:\n\n>(Most rulers are) Mediocre rulers. These mediocre rulers ...  need to hold to the \\[universal\\] law. If you wait for a Yao or Shun to come, ... it will only be one generation of order in a thousand generations of disorder.\n\n* This line of thought is much closer to the modern Western thoughts, in a sense that it did not romanticize a distant past, and focused on building a system that worked for the present\n* Confucianism had a different approach from Legalism. It drew on the nostalgia of the past. The basic idea of Confucius (551\\~479 BC) was that **if everyone was civilized and well-mannered following the ancient rites and morality of Zhou** (or the times of mythical Yao and Shun)**, the peace and stability** that had existed in the good old times **would be restored**.\n* e.g. **Confucian classics are basically about the rites, poems, histories, and divination mysticism of the ancient Zhou** **(800 BC or before)**. For example\n* [Book of Rites](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Book_of_Rites) (or **Rites of Zhou)**: a collection of texts describing the social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites of the Zhou dynasty\n* [Classic of Poetry](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Classic_of_Poetry): a collection of ancient poems that date back to the early Zhou period\n* [Book of Documents](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Book_of_Documents): the history of the mythical era, (mythical) Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties\n* [Book of Change](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I_Ching) (or **Divination of Zhou** \u5468\u6613): a synthesis of divination mysticism passed down from the immemorial past (yin\/yang - famously [Leibniz](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Binary_number#Leibniz_and_the_I_Ching) got the idea of binary mathematics from this book)\n* [Etiquette and Ceremonial](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Etiquette_and_Ceremonial): Zhou dynasty social behavior and ceremonial rituals - many rites and rituals regulated women's life, particularly. For example [**three obedience**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Three_Obediences_and_Four_Virtues) **of women**\n* Note that these are all knowledge about a society that existed in 1,000\\~500 BC, but were used as the core text for scholarly education and civil service exams until the 19th century\n\n\\*\\* Interestingly, the civil service exam itself was not the product of the Confucian tradition; it was more of a Legalist idea in the beginning\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Then what was the ideal Zhou society like, in Confucianists' minds? I would say:\n   * Back then, land was fairly distributed, farmers and peasants were happy, and tax was low. Farmers barely knew that a king existed. **The younger revered the elders, women obeyed their husbands, children obeyed their parents, and local nobles paid respect to the highest king.** People were well-mannered and did not break proper social norms. Things did not \"deviate\" and everything was in harmony. The time was peaceful. If people are civilized and educated with **proper rites and rituals**, the world will regain harmony again.\n* This simple idea was mixed up with various other ancient mysticism such as yin\/yang, five elements, [four pillars](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Four_Pillars_of_Destiny) (divination chart that originated from the ancient pyromancy and oracle bone practices), dragon symbolism, etc.\n* Plus, the **Confucian spirituality** was centered around **patrilineal ancestor shrines**. The holy rites of Zhou was often referred to as \"t**he laws of spirit tablets**\" (spirit tablets for ancestor patriarchs). Through regular ancestor spirit worship rituals, **the unbroken lineage of paternal bloodline of a clan became divine**. Not being able to continue it was not just the matter of inheritance disputes, but **the matter of a spiritual sin**. This \"laws of spirit tablets\" would become so central to Korean political ideology and spirituality in the Joseon period (**and turn out to be very oppressive to women**).\n\n\\*\\* Another idea of Confucius was to judge (and thus control) a ruler's behavior by means of history writing. His history book *Spring and Autumn Annals* provided the style and criteria of evaluating a ruler. The Chinese (and Korean) practices of giving a king a \"posthumous temple name\" according to their behaviors, and having an office of historiographers who kept the records of state affairs every day, originated from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is neo-Confucianism?**\n\n* Neo-Confucianism is an academic term to describe a later version of Confucianism enhanced with more **self-disciplinary principles and esoteric theologies** influenced by Buddhism and Daoism (e.g. In addition to \"be well-mannered,\" now you were taught to \"have less desires\"). This first emerged during the medieval Song dynasty in China (around 12th century AD), synthesized by a scholar named [Zhu Xi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zhu_Xi)\n* I have limited information on how neo-Confucianism unfolded in China or Vietnam - when I know more, I will add more information.\n* However, I know how it unfolded in Joseon Korea. **The 15th century medieval Joseon was a radically different society from the bronze age China in the 10th century BC**. In order to restore the ideal of the Zhou society (that had existed 2,500 years before) envisioned by Confucius, **Koreans went radical and dogmatic in applying the ancient social norms** to the contemporary life in Joseon Korea. For example,\n   * e.g. \"[**Mourn for three years when your parents die**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Filial_mourning)**\"** \\- even the Chinese did not literally abide by this, but Koreans did. There was a political storm caused by this which I will mention later on\n   * e.g. \"**Men and women do not sit together after the age 7**\" (source: Rite of Zhou) - this ancient social rule is not even well-known among the Chinese themselves, but Koreans followed it. Most modern Koreans still know this phrase\n\n\\*\\* In both China and Korea, **the rise of neo-Confucianism tended to go with the** [**harsher oppression**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Women_in_ancient_and_imperial_China#Ming_dynasty) **of women**\n\n* e.g. **Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues** ([link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Three_Fundamental_Bonds_and_Five_Constant_Virtues))\n   * This \"principles\" that govern social relationships became central in Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianists believed that humans could become sages through perfecting these relationships and virtues, by practicing proper rites\n   * Three bonds:\n\n>The lord is yang, the retainer is yin; the father is yang, the son is yin; the husband is yang, the wife is yin. The way of yin cannot proceed any where on its own.... Therefore, **the retainer depends on his lord to gain merit; the son depends on his father; the wife on her husband**, yin on yang, and the Earth on Heaven.... The Three \\[Fundamental Bonds\\] of the kingly way can be sought in Heaven\n\n\\*\\* \"**Men are the Heaven, women are the Earth**\" is a Korean proverb that originated from this idea - any modern Korean person has heard of this phrase\n\n* A neo-Confucian book \"Zhu Xi's Family Rites\" ([link](https:\/\/baike.baidu.hk\/item\/%E5%AE%B6%E7%A6%AE\/8239843))  was also widely distributed in Joseon\n* Interestingly, the emergence of neo-Confucianism coincided with the emergence of foot-binding practices in China\n   * even though this might be just a pure coincidence\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Was Confucianism a bad ideology?**\n\nConfucianism as a political and state ideology is dead in all modern East Asian societies, as monarchy was abolished and no one considered the ancient agrarian Zhou society as an ideal anymore.\n\nThe intention of Confucius and Confucianists was not bad. They idealized the Zhou dynasty because they viewed it as more moral than the pre-existing, more ancient [Shang dynasty](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shang_dynasty) where bloody extravagance and (allegedly) human sacrifice had been performed. They also thought that governance by \"rites and ethics\" was more humane than governance by impersonal law and systems.\n\nConfucianists were concerned about peace, stability, and overall welfare of the society. **Any serious Confucian politician would try to reform land distribution, store grains to give out to poor people in bad times, and lower the taxes for poor people**.\n\n* However, the Confucian ideal was always modelled after a distant past. **Confucian reforms were about the \"restoration\" of the ancient ideal**, not about finding a new, better way to do things.\n* For example, Confucian scholars often thought that it is ideal to **restore the \"**[**well-field system**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Well-field_system)**\" that had existed in the 9th century BC**. *Jeong Yak-yong*, a Joseon reformist in the 18th century (explained in section 17), still argued for the restoration of this system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the face of modernism, many Koreans started viewing neo-Confucianism as something **obsolete and oppressive** \\- also, a \"wrong\" kind of ideology that significantly weakened *Joseon* in comparison to Japan.\n\nIn retrospect, we might think that Confucianism **attributed a wrong factor** to the peace and stability of the early Zhou society. The Zhou society was stable and peaceful \"not because\" the people had the right ethics and social norms, but because it was just lucky in its timing and location. Early-Zhou (bronze age) China did not have a lot of external threats. The **bronze age civilization** was relatively safe and well-protected from the outside world, the same way Egypt was - **only under that condition, a purely agrarian society ruled by \"divine\" rites without military and commercial power** could peacefully exist.\n\nConfucianism also had an idealistic view of human beings (at least **men**) as being [innately good](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mencius) or as having a potential to be good. Neo-Confucianists constantly debated about human nature throughout Joseon Korea. This idealistic view, sadly, proved to be incompatible with the advent of the global market economy and the rise of new military powers (Japan, Western powers)\n\n* Compared to this, many dominant Western ideologies view human nature as flawed - in Christianity we are all sinners, and modern economics posit that we all pursue self-interests. This sobering view about human nature tends to require a more impersonal, universal system or principles.\n\nOverall, **the intention behind the idea of Confucianism was good, but idealizing a 2,500 years old bronze age society was essentially anachronistic** \\- especially in places like 15th\\~19th century Joseon. **Orthodoxy was a problem** in Joseon Korea. Over time, the focus of the Confucian debates in Joseon **moved from the substantial welfare of the people to the literal application of obsolete norms**, which turned out to be unproductive and oppressive.\n\n* Uh... I think we are perhaps seeing... a similar trend in the United States??\n\n\\*\\* Although Confucianism died as a political ideology, it is still very much alive as a collection of social norms and symbolism in South Korea, and also in North Korea. Even the South Korean flag is based on the [ancient Confucian mysticism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bagua) (based on a divination book mentioned above)\n\n\\*\\* There is also an interesting overlap between **Confucianism and communism. A society of happy farmers with equally distributed and communally owned lands** \\-- doesn't that sound familiar? That was exactly the ideal of Maoism. \"The agrarian utopia on Earth\" -- to some extent, **the Maoist ideal society was essentially an old Confucian ideal without the scholarly class and monarchy**.\n\n* Both in Confucian and communist regimes, sadly, the agrarian utopias would often come to an ugly end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How did neo-Confucianism transform the Joseon society?**\n\n* **Confucian orthodoxy**: The Joseon ruling class set up many Confucian academies and institutions throughout the country, and aimed for the transformation of the whole society based on the Confucian classics written over 2,000 years before.\n   * Why this happened is still a bit unclear to me. There was a similar trend in the Ming China (and perhaps Vietnam) - **rejecting foreign, impure influences** (Mongol, nomadic culture, Buddhism, etc) and trying to **go back to the pure Confucian ideal**\n   * **Joseon Korea was on steroids** with this, though. Perhaps because of the **much smaller size and ethnic homogeneity** of Korea, the Korean ruling class could implement the retro movement a lot more thoroughly than their Chinese counterpart did\n      * In the modern Korean Internet slang, extreme social conservatism is pejoratively called \"Confucian taliban\"... for a good reason.\n   * The Korean ruling class considered their country as a small China, or even a more successful and purer successor of the ancient Chinese ideology. It was reflected in their cartographic worldview: in this [map](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gangnido) made in 1402, **China is at the center of the world, while Korea is the second largest country in the world** right next to it\n\nImpact:\n\n* (1) **Women's status and rights significantly deteriorated**\n   * This is one of the most conspicuous social changes commonly associated with the *Joseon* era. Women's status was not as radically low in the previous *Silla and Goryeo* \\- *Silla* had several queen rulers.\n   * What happened in Joseon is like, with only a little bit of exaggeration, watching the Handmaid's Tale unfolding over 500 years. I made a separate post about this before: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/wzqxuu\/womens\\_oppression\\_in\\_joseon\\_era\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/wzqxuu\/womens_oppression_in_joseon_era\/)\n      * In a nutshell: **divorce was banned, a widow's remarriage was banned, women had no rights to inherit from her birth family, a woman's duty came to be serving her in-laws and producing a son** (to continue the **divine** unbroken patrilineal lineage of her in-law's clan)**, and patrilineal villages emerged** (brothers, fathers, sons, and male relatives live together while women are exchanged between villages at young ages), and so on - all this made a woman a slave to her husband and in-law family\n      * I heard that there's a Chinese proverb \"a woman without talent is virtuous\" - the same idea existed in Korea as well. Plus a woman was taught to \"Obey your father, then your husband, then your son\"\n* (2) **Filial piety**\n   * Filial piety (\u5b5d, pronounced as 'hyo' in Korean) is a very important virtue in Confucianism; from the Western point of view, it is often viewed as (unquestioned) **deference and obedience to one's parents** \\- that still influences the culture of modern East Asia\n   * Somewhere in the Confucian classics it is mentioned \"Mourn for three years when your parents die\" - a renowned neo-Confucianist named Jeong Mong-ju [literally followed this](https:\/\/folkency.nfm.go.kr\/en\/topic\/detail\/215) by **spending the entire three year living in a shack beside his parents\u2019 graves**. After this, three year mourning became very popular throughout Korea\n      * During the war with Japan, some generals and soldiers in the war left the battlefield when they heard the news of the death of their parents to mourn for three years\n* (3) **the** [**purge**](https:\/\/read.dukeupress.edu\/journal-of-korean-studies\/article-abstract\/22\/1\/101\/166804\/Buddhism-during-the-Choson-Dynasty-1392-1910-A?redirectedFrom=fulltext) **of** [**Buddhism**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Buddhism#Suppression_under_the_Joseon_Dynasty_(1392%E2%80%931910)) **and shamanism**\n   * **Buddhist temples in cities were either closed** or transformed into a Confucian shrine - That's why most Buddhist temples in Korea are now deep in the mountains. **Shamans (mostly female)** were also heavily oppressed and ostracized\n      * But many Joseon women preserved their strong faiths in Buddhism and Shamanism - **Confucianism offered spiritual solace only for men in a patrilineal clan**. Women went to Buddhist monks and shamans to pray, confess their problems, and cleanse their souls. Buddhism is still a large religion in Korea (despite the spread of Christianity), and about [50,000 shamanic rituals](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/05\/08\/973254913\/shamanism-endures-in-both-koreas-but-in-the-north-shamans-risk-arrest-or-worse) are still held each year in Greater Seoul now.\n* (4) **Centralization and land reform**\n   * In the previous *Goryeo* period, [only 1\/3 of administrative units](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Injong_of_Goryeo) were under the direct control of the central government. The *Joseon* government started sending **magistrate**s who passed the centralized civil service exam to most localities. They wore a special kind of clothes ([image](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/11djvLr))\n      * There are many folktales where a new magistrate is killed by female ghosts in a new village. There's a theory that they were actually poisoned and killed by old local clans\n   * There's an interesting theory that there was [a unbroken chain of slavery](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/nation\/2022\/09\/638_289137.html) in Korea for 1,400 years since the time of *Unified Silla*, because the ruling class never changed (comparable to France)\n      * While *Joseon* did not abolish slavery, it **abolished ancient slave ghettos** called [hyang\/so\/bugok](https:\/\/www.wikipe.wiki\/wiki\/ko\/%ED%96%A5%C2%B7%EC%86%8C%C2%B7%EB%B6%80%EA%B3%A1). They were most likely villages that had lost the war in ancient warfares (comparable to Japanese [Buraku](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burakumin), which still exists).\n   * Confucian scholars cared about the **fair distribution of lands**. In the early Joseon period when the society was healthy, land reform was the most important political issue.\n* (5) **Anti-commercialism, Isolationism, and anti-militarism**\n   * This perhaps was the factor that most heavily influenced the geopolitics of Joseon. Given that Confucianism was basically a retro ideology that idealized an agrarian past, Joseon scholars **put agriculture (rice farming) on a pedestal, while discouraging trades and commercial activities**\n      * [Confucian hierarchy of occupation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Four_occupations): **Scholars > Farmers > Craftsmen > Merchants** \\>>> Slaves\n      * The legacy of this is still alive - for example, blue collar technicians in South Korea are still heavily looked down upon compared to college graduates\n   * **Isolationism** \\- Joseon kept only [one port](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Busan) open for Japanese traders. There was still a little [Muslim](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islam_in_Korea#Decree_against_the_Huihui_community) merchant community by the beginning of the 15th century, but they were forced to abandon their headgear and close their mosques. This contrasts with the previous *Silla* and *Goryeo* period where the ruling class engaged in international trades more actively\n      * The domestic trades were also not active - the government collected taxes in the form of agricultural produces and regional specialties, instead of coins. In other words, the economy was largely a barter economy. **The anti-commercial and frugal taste of the ruling class** was reflected on cultural products - the porcelains became [simply white](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseon_white_porcelain), often without any decorations <> in contrast to much more sophisticated [Goryeo wares](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goryeo_ware)*.* *Goryeo* used to export *Goryeo wares* to China and other countries, but more crude Joseon porcelains lost markets.\n      * **The clothes were white** **without any color or decorations** for both upper class and commoners\n      * The influence of anti-commercialism was limited in Ming China because the Chinese economy was already way too large, and silver was pouring in from, for example, Portugal. However, the anti-commercialism and isolationism **effectively impoverished the nation**\n   * Lastly, anti-militarism. Confucianism (and thus Joseon) idealized an ancient agrarian society in the 10th century BC **when there was no external threats** such as powerful nomadic groups or Japan. The Chinese Emperor [Wen of Han](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emperor_Wen_of_Han) dynasty (in the 2nd century BC) was praised for levying only 2\\~3% of tax on the population, but it was only possible in an ancient time before the rise of nomadic military powers and later, the West and Japan\n      * However, based on the Confucian orthodox, the Joseon scholarly ruling class paid little attention to military organizations or intelligence on other nations, only focusing on internal affairs, royal succession, and \"rites.\" Even after the devastating experience with Mongols. **This effectively rendered the country powerless when Japan successfully modernized**\n      * The same trend occurred in Ming China as well - resulting in them being easily conquered by Manchus (former Jurchens) later on. [This book](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_Loss_of_Vietnam) says that the same trend existed in Vietnam too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, neo-Confucianism as a retro ideology dominated the Joseon society for 500 years, and its legacy still lingers on. Many Koreans believe that this laid the foundation for the **social conservatism and patriarchy** that's still deep-rooted in South Korea, and **isolationism and three generations of patrilineal succession** in North Korea.\n\n* I'm not saying patriarchy doesn't exist in other countries (including the West), but for example, South Korea has the largest gender gap in income among the OECD countries.\n* **Samsung Lee family and North Korean Kim family still follow the same pattern of succession** \\- [agnatic primogeniture](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture) \\- the eldest son inherits no matter what, and female\/maternal lines are ignored. The Japanese (also Roman) way of taking a competent man into the family as a son-in-law is unheard, and unthinkable. **Paternal blood is the most important**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------\n\nOh well this was a very long intro, lol. The history of the Joseon is extremely well documented, but many materials are still only available in Korean.\n\nIn this series of post, I'll introduce the 500 years of Joseon history at a level that most Koreans are familiar with. The whole post got crazy long so I had divide it, but still this is not that much deep. I divided the history into **5 phases and 22 time periods** that involve a major event or monarch. Most Koreans are familiar with the way I described Phase 1\\~4. I went a lot deeper in the Phase 5 (the last phase before the annexation to Japan), and provide a little bit different interpretation than what most Koreans are familiar with, especially with regards to the role of the last queen Myeongseong.\n\n* This post is very monarch-centered because that's how the [Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Veritable_Records_of_the_Joseon_Dynasty) was written, the main source of what we know about Joseon. **Many Koreans know a lot about Joseon kings and their stories**. Interestingly, however, I heard that North Koreans do not teach people about the history of monarchs. They instead focus on generals, folk heroes and artists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------\n\nThe post continues with\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phase 1. Early prosperity \\[15th century\\]\n* Phase 2.

Their reception varied depending on the context they were viewed in. In an American context they were viewed negatively due to the association with communism and authoritarianism. In the developing world though at the time, it was widely different. They were admired as revolutionary leaders and these are historical factors. These factors will include both the context as well as historical precursors that could have shaped global perceptions in the developing world of the Cuban revolution in the 1950s and 60s.\n\n**(i)Post War decolonisation and Che Guevara's internationalism**\n\n* When the Cuban revolution started out Castro and many of his compatriots were nationalists. They were focused on specific issues in Cuba and they drew inspiration from historical Cuban nationalist figures such as Jose Marti and Carlos Manuel Cespedes. Now even with this specifically nationalist focus the revolution was famous enough.\n* Che Guevara's presence in the ranks of the Cuban revolutionaries was important in terms of bring an internationalist perspective. Which isn't that surprising. The Argentine who on his motorcycle travelled all of Latin American, landed in Guatemala when the CIA coup was taking place, and then landed in Mexico to meet Castro. Che brought an ideological internationalism to a revolution that had a nationalist start. And you could see this in the roles that he played. He was one of the founding fathers of Cuba's Medical Internationalism. He was a key diplomat who was important in forging the revolutionary government's diplomatic ties both with the Eastern Bloc as well as many of the Non Aligned countries of the third world as well as revolutionary movements.\n* Che's internationalism happen to take place at the same time that you had post war decolonisation movements. The Egyptian revolution of the 50s under Nasser. The Algerian revolution of the 50s and 60s with Ahmed Ben Bella. The independence movement of the Congo, etc. Che's internationalism formed if you will a bridge between the Cuban revolution and the anti colonial movements at the time. And this is symbolised in Che's speech in Algeria in 1965.\n\n**(ii)The Bay of Pigs and the context of CIA coups in the developing world**\n\n* Another reason for the Cuban revolution's popularity in the developing world was the victory at the Bay of Pigs. The historical context for this being significant are the CIA coups of the 50s and 60s. When you place the coups in Iran(53) Guatemala(54) Congo(60) and other attempted coups such as Indonesia in the background of the Bay of Pigs it becomes obvious why many in the developing world at the time would view this as an inspiration because it ended up symbolising a type of defiant self determination. \n\n**(iii)The Cuban revolution and the background of Latin American independence leaders**\n\n* I had hinted at before the role of Cuba's independence leaders like Cespedes and Jose Marti in terms of inspiring the nationalist element of the Cuban revolution. I also think that the memory of Latin America's independence was what inspired its popularity throughout Latin America. Figures such as Simon Bolivar and Jose San Martin's story of fighting an anti colonial war of independence throughout Latin America would have had some similarities with the story of Castro and Che in the minds of some Latin Americans. Especially Che Guevara's story of the Argentine who journey's North, mirroring Jose San Martin in his meeting with Simon Bolivar. \n\n**(iv)The Cuban Revolution and the Anti Apartheid Movement**\n\n* The Cuban revolution had a major inspiration on the Anti Apartheid movement of the 20th century. In the 1960s when the ANC was forming its military wing they took as an inspiration for their military doctrines Che Guevara's manual on Guerilla War. When Nelson Mandela made his \"I am prepared to Die\" speech he states explicitly it was partly inspired by Castro's \"History will Absolve Me\" speech. And then there was the military assistance Cuba gave during the Cold War. This of course amplified the Cuban revolution's popularity in Africa. \n\nYou combine this with both the military and medical internationalism of the Cuban government during the Cold War and it explains its popularity.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1665430394.0},{"title":"How a Black man rose to prominence at the height of Britain\u2019s slave trade","author":"Alabama_otters2002","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W-FipxCXIy0","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1665237210.0},{"title":"Simple\/Short\/Silly History Questions Saturday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/xyr04f\/simpleshortsilly_history_questions_saturday\/","text":" \n\nWelcome to our Simple\/Short\/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask?

Archaeologists like Francis Pryor and Susan Oosthuizen point out that there is zero archaeological evidence to support the idea of an invasion, and in fact all the evidence currently available suggests a great deal of continuity in the lifestyles of the early medieval Britons, and that the English identity emerged organically over centuries of exposure to and trade with other North Sea peoples as Britain shifted away from being on the fringes of a Mediterranean trade network, and ended up center stage of a North Sea trade network. Basically that the Britons became the English because it was more fashionable at the time to do so. Their arguments are very compelling, and even offer fascinating reinterpretations of the written history of the period that suggest that Bede invented the idea of an English people not as an ethnic group, but as a sort of code for \"Catholic Britons\" as opposed to the \"Celtic Christian Britons\" who had all the same beliefs (more or less), but didn't report to the Pope in Rome (which makes it so much more ironic that the English were the ones who would eventually abandon Catholicism and the Irish would uphold it throughout the Protestant Reformation). \n\nWhat I cannot wrap my head around though is the linguistic side of things. Let's assume this theory is correct, and that there never was an invasion or mass migration of Germanic peoples to the British Isles in the early medieval period. In that case, how the hell did a new Germanic language spring up on an island that had previously only spoken variations of Latin and Celtic? How or why did these groups of people invent a language that belonged to a totally different language family, wildly unrelated to the languages previously spoken? I can't think of any other instance in history where that occurred without some sort of coercion or influx of settlers. It would be like if Afrikaans emerged in South Africa without there being any influx of Dutch or British settlers. Or if the Japanese had invented and then adopted a totally new Romance language after meeting Portuguese merchants for the first time. Even Swahili, which is probably the closest analogy, is still a Bantu language, even though it borrows heavily from Arabic.\n\nSo IF there was no Anglo Saxon migration, then where did the English language come from and why is it so vastly different from Latin and Celtic?\n\n(For those curious, here is a documentary and a lecture from Pryor and Oosthuizen, respectively): \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TqDusYEXwD0&ab_channel=Chronicle-MedievalHistoryDocumentaries\n\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/425282049\n\nEDIT: After reading a bunch of these comments, I'd like to reframe my question. If the migration DID happen in some form or another, then why is there so little archaeological evidence to support it? If enough people were migrating into Britain to change the linguistic and genetic makeup as much as it seems they did, then why is there so little evidence as to cast doubt on it in the first place? Where are their bodies? Why are their burials indistinguishable from the locals'? Why is there no discernable change in settlement or land use patterns? Why does the archaeology contradict the genetics instead of support it?","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1665034494.0},{"title":"Glenbank shipwreck: Finnish vessel that sank off coast of Western Australia in 1911 found | Western Australia","author":"Culturedecanted","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2022\/oct\/06\/glenbank-shipwreck-finnish-vessel-that-sank-off-coast-of-western-australia-in-1911-found","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1665012707.0},{"title":"See lifelike facial reconstructions of a medieval Scottish woman, priest and bishop","author":"unheated1","url":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/medieval-facial-reconstruction-scotland","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1664906530.0},{"title":"Hercules statue, approximately 2,000 years old, discovered in Greece - The Jerusalem Post","author":"DRKILLM0NGER","url":"https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/archaeology\/article-718941","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1664888999.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/xw7hqw\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

While it didn't use the same racial system as the Atlantic Slave Trade, and people of many ethnicities could be enslaved, we can't just give no for an answer.\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm talking about the Indian Ocean world BEFORE European exploration\/colonization started there circa 1500. I haven't researched anything after that. There was a boom in the Indian Ocean slave trade around 1900 when the Atlantic trade was banned. My knowledge is between 900-1450 AD, the heyday of maritime trade between Africa, Middle East, India, Indonesia and China.*\n\n**SHORT ANSWER TL;DR**\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade was very clear cut. One drop and you're black (thus subhuman and legally discriminated against) and you're a slave unless your master frees you. Even then you're still legally black. **There was no one drop rule in Asia, and race was not a legal status all by itself. BUT! There is a persistent historical association between slavery and blackness, and prejudice towards black Africans.** Africa was the main source of people who became commodities on the global maritime market in the Indian Ocean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LONG ANSWER** (see bottom of post for a paragraph sketching the time period if you want context)\n\nTHE BASICS OF THE SLAVE TRADE\n\nSlavery was common within all these societies and most slaves were owned by someone of the same ethnicity as them. But when speaking of a slave trade, it's mostly African. Many parts of Africa could be raided for slaves with impunity, unheard of for India or Oman. Sometimes a local leader would sell people from his realm, or poor parents would sell a child. Other people just got kidnapped--by foreigners or a neighboring nation. A non African person could of course be kidnapped by pirates and sold, or sold by her family.  But there wasn't the same kind of steady stream of people shipped all over the way there was for Africa. \n\nMost slaves in this trade were women and children, with women becoming domestic workers or concubines. Agriculture was not based on the slave trade. It was more of a luxury to have a slave than an economic necessity. The exception to this is the Zanj slave revolt in Iraq 869-883. Large numbers of African slaves, supported by other low ranking members of society, rose up after being forced to do backbreaking work converting salt marshes into farmland. Zanj is an Arabic word for African, which also can mean slave. It was one of the largest and most successful slave revolts in history, with a multi ethnic rebel coalition ruling much of Iraq for decades.\n\nIslam reformed slavery and made it more humane. The Quran frequently encourages people to free their slaves and to treat them kindly. It stresses that no person is superior to the other aside from their moral character. Muslims freed their slaves far more often than Europeans did. Islamic custom declared an enslaved woman who gave birth to her master's child was set free. It was also customary for a master to release all his slaves when he died. Children of slaves were not slaves themselves. Slaves could be educated, and some became high ranking government officials! Paradoxically, many people might have looked down on Africans and also got bossed around by one. There is even an empire in India founded by a slave. Some historians say an unintended consequence of Muslim reforms was to encourage raiding for new slaves, rather than building up a large population of slaves at home. It was against Islamic law to enslave another Muslim, though many people chose to ignore this.\n\nMuslims saw each other as part of one community that transcended wealth and ethnic ties. Muslims of all colors went on the same pilgrimage, and would offer each other hospitality during travel. Arabic became a unifying language spoken everywhere there were Muslims. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPERCEPTIONS OF BLACKNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 800-1400 CE\n\nThe Arabic word *abeed* means slave, and today is still used as a synonym for black (it's a slur). You can find racist descriptions in the writing of scholars and travelers from the time-- all the way back to Galen (Roman Empire) who wrote that black men were sexually insatiable. \n\n* In the Hadhramaut-- a desert on the coast of Syria-- slaves and freed slaves had to live in a ghetto on the outskirts of town. Freed black slaves in Syria were often stuck doing domestic work, so many of them went to sea, mostly settling in Southeast Asia. The only people lower than them were the descendants of Ethiopians who had invaded Arabia before Islam. Merchants came from the highest class of people in this society, the siyyids. Siyyids settled heavily abroad and married foreign women, but would only let their daughters marry other siyyids. The mixed children and grandchildren of these marriages were called *muwallad*. Some people in the siyyid ex pat community were prejudiced against muwallad, reflecting their anxiety about preserving Hadhrami culture while living somewhere else.\n* Black Iraqis and Iranians today have a long history of discrimination, living in ghettos, restricted to lowly professions, and being told \"don't marry my daughter.\" Their culture is still distinct from the dominant national culture and their heritage is excluded from the national narrative. Iranian theater has a history of blackface, which has many parallels to minstrel shows in the United States.\n\nHowever, ethnic lines were not as clearly drawn back then (900-1400). Many people who would have been black by European standards identified as Arab because that was their culture. Wealth, religion and connections were often way more important than what you looked like. In Hindu law on the coast of India, all foreign merchants were \"impure\" according to the caste system and lumped together. They had to live together in a certain part of the port city (which is what the foreigners preferred anyway!)\n\nOn the East Coast of Africa, or the Swahili Coast, a hybrid culture formed between Africans and foreign merchants, mostly from Oman, Syria and Iran. The monsoon season meant you had to wait several months for the winds to change, so the merchants would bide their time in Africa and get to know people there. Parts of the Swahili Coast (East Africa between the Horn and next to Madagascar) were ruled by Muslims from Shiraz (Iran) and Oman at times, and local Africans had a lower status than people of mixed Arab and African descent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOTHER KINDS OF SERVITUDE IN ASIA \n\n**But most societies enslaved \"their own people,\" right?** Yes, but the line between a slave and a servant was blurry and had variations in different places. Before buying a slave from Africa was possible, the wealthy had longstanding traditions of relying on people to fulfill their whims and impunity in how they treated them. I remember the biography of Virginia Woolf remarked that before modern appliances, having servants was considered essential for having a comfortable life. Not unique to England.\n\nConcubines and maids in China were bought at a market with money and vulnerable to abuse and stigma. But you became a concubine when you or your parents signed a contract. It could happen to anybody, though an upright man would be horrified if he found out his new concubine came from a noble family and might let her go or even set up a proper marriage for her. Ordinary maids in China had contracts and would seek a new employer when their term of service was up. \n\nIn India, the Brahmins and military leaders had plantations worked by serfs, bound to the land. These serfs were local people. \n\nIn Arabia, both before and after Muhammad, you could become a slave if you got into debt or were captured in war. But you could also buy your way out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SKETCH OF THE TIME PERIOD** \n\nSo the whole coast of the Indian Ocean is engaged in constant trade, cramming multiple voyages every year thanks to the predictable monsoon winds. Madagascar, East Coast of Africa, Oman, Yemen, Iran, India, Indonesia, China and even Australia are involved. **The heyday of the trade is roughly 900-1450 AD.** Keep in mind that it was going on at least since the Roman Empire complained about spending all its silver on India's goods. Also remember there's a healthy overland trade as well, to bring the stuff from the ships to people living inland.\n\nThere's a cosmopolitan coastal culture that is separate from the inland cultures, but melded all the continents together. If a city was a center of trade, it was home to THOUSANDS of merchants from all over the world and closely connected to other cities like it. (Keep in mind the world had way fewer people back then). It was common for sailors to have wives and children on multiple continents! Ordinary people ate exotic food and the rich enjoyed luxuries from around the world. Not many ethnically Chinese merchants actually sailed for most of this period because the central government restricted trade, though Chinese goods were everywhere. Foreigners living in China often handled most of the trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sources (It would take a long time to list them all, but here's a few)\n\nDhow Cultures of the Indian Ocean: Cosmopolitanism, Commerce and Islam  by Abdul Sheriff (book)\n\nTrade and Civilisation in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750   by K.

He also declared that Goryeo was an Empire and he himself was an Emperor, which Korean dynasties didn't usually do in order not to provoke China. He temporarily used Goryeo's own era names, instead of [Chinese ones](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chinese_era_name).\n   * Slavery revived after his attempts, and the civil service exam degenerated into some distorted form of the system of hereditary privilege, though\n* Later he got paranoid, and **killed a lot of his relatives**, including a brother, and his father's in-law families. He suffered from nightmares later on, and died at the age of 50. Being a monarch must not be an easy thing.\n* His son from the marriage with his half-sister became the [next king](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gyeongjong_of_Goryeo) \\- he avoided politics and royalty, and hung out with commoners.

[**Mongol Invasion**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mongol_invasions_of_Korea) \\[1231 \\~ 1257\\]\n\nAnd Mongols came.\n\nKorean history textbooks tend to just say that when Mongols came, *Goryeo*'s military rulers heavily resisted, but eventually the royal court decided to surrender and become a vassal state.\n\nBut when I think about it, it's a bit mysterious. In Korea, I've never heard of Mongol's biological warfare (catapulting plagued corpses into sieged cities) or the reign of terror and depopulating the cities. I learned it by studying the history of Mongol invasions in other regions.\n\nI don't know why Mongol cruelty is not so well-known and discussed in Korea even though Koreans **heavily resisted** the Mongol invasion. For example, during the Mongol invasion, a military dictator of Goryeo **moved the royal court and the entire population of the capital to** [an island](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mongol_invasions_of_Korea#Second_Mongol_invasion_of_Korea_(June_1232_%E2%80%93_December_1232)) to resist Mongols. A Korean Buddhist monk **killed the commander of the Horde**.\n\n* I don't know how this didn't end up in catapulting bubonic plagued corpses or the annihilation of the entire royal court and the original capital population. If I find good answers I will add it here. There's also a Reddit discussion about this [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/ooo4qm\/why\\_did\\_the\\_mongols\\_have\\_such\\_difficulties\\_in\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/korea\/comments\/ooo4qm\/why_did_the_mongols_have_such_difficulties_in\/)\n\nWhat seems crazy to me is that during the Mongol Invasion, the royal court and military rulers funded to build an **extremely large wooden Buddhist scripture** (that consists of 81,258 wooden printing blocks) called [Tripitaka Koreana](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tripitaka_Koreana) to call for **divine power and inspire patriotism** among peasants. This gigantic artefact is still well-preserved in [Haeinsa temple](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Haeinsa) in Southern Korea.\n\n* This type of Buddhism is sometimes called \"Patriot Buddhism\" in Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe capital **remained in the island for 27 years** resisting Mongols. The Mongols (with Korean collaborators) made multiple invasions and ravaged Korea.\n\n* The peasantry resisted for a long time, but they eventually surrendered with famine and despair. There was a colony of Goryeo defectors in Manchuria (Liaoning peninsula)\n* The military ruler Choe clan that **insisted in resisting in the island** was eventually overthrown by the royal court and those who were tired of prolonged war\n   * A treaty was signed with Mongols that Goryeo remains as an **autonomous vassal state**, the kings of Goryeo **must marry Mongol princesses**.\n* [Sambyeolcho](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sambyeolcho) \\- The military ruler clan's core military unit. Even after the king\u2019s surrender, they revolted and **still fought Mongols, moving from island to island** in the Southwest Korea. They ended up in Jeju ([Tamna](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tamna)) island, which had a distinct language and statehood back then.\n   * The Mongol finally crushed the rebellion in 1273 in Jeju, and took the island under the direct control. They used **Jeju island as a grassland and horse ranch**. The Mongol forces remained in Jeju for more than 100 years (there are a few loan words from Mongolian in [Jeju language](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeju_language)). As a result, Jeju is still famous for its ranches and [horse](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeju_horse)s\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* The Mongols tried to invade Japan via Korea, but **typhoons called** [**Kamikaze**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kamikaze_(typhoon)) (\"God's Wind\") thwarted the Mongol fleets. While **Korea was completely ravaged, but Japan was intact**.\n\n* I wonder this was what caused a version of [Great Divergence](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_Divergence) that happened between the Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelago. Korea declined economically and commercially, but Japan rose\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMongol's dominance was just about 100 years, but it left a mark that still exists in the Korean culture. For example\n\n* Wedding (bridal) style: Korean traditional [bride](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/39HqYxl) and Mongol traditional [bride](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9FAycUD) (from Wikipedia)\n   * It is said that the **red dot**s on the bride's face (*Yeonji gonji*) and **coronet** [Jokduri](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jokduri) originated from Mongol customs\n* [Distilled liquor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_alcoholic_drinks#Distilled_liquors) was introduced by the Mongols. This is the origin of Soju\n* Jeju island still being famous for its horses and ranches - they have several Mongol loanwords \n* Mongolian language schools and textbooks survived well into the early years of *Joseon* dynasty\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, two people are famous for leaking technologies from Yuan China: \n\n* [Moon Ik-jeom](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mun_Ikjeom) **secretly brought cottonseeds in his writing brush cap** from Yuan China, and started cultivating in Southern Korea\n   * I don't know why but this story is very famous among Koreans \n* [Choi Mu-seon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Choe_Museon) **brought gunpowder** from Yuan China, which was guarded as a secret.

However, after she died from the childbirth complication, he started developing depression and \"mental instability.\" \n   * He started **being pederastic with young men**, and \"went so far as to create a ministry whose sole purpose was to seek out and recruit young men from all over the country to serve in his court.\" \n   * It is often said in Korea that the king also cross-dressed in a female clothes in court, but I can't find any credible source for that for now. Perhaps a myth. \n   * He was **most likely bisexual**. Later he got close to a female slave of his Buddhist monk advisor and had a son with her, who later became the next king. \n   * Interestingly, he's known as one of the best artists from the *Goryeo* era - some of his artworks survived to the present day. \n* Mongol's dominance was weakening. Upon the advise from [Choi Young](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Choe_Yeong), a famous military general, King Gongmin **tried to cut the tie with the Mongols**, while establishing new ties with the rising Ming dynasty (Han Chinese dynasty). *Choi Young* **restored some of the northern territories** lost to Mongols. \n   * He tried to reform the land and country with the help of the [Buddhist monk advisor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sin_Don) (who had a dubious background - being born between a princess and a slave) he trusted. However, this was met with fierce resistance from the aristocrats who had benefited from collaborating with the Mongols \n      * The Buddhist monk was killed from the political opposition \n      * Interestingly, King Gongmin was killed by a young man who had an affair with one of his concubines \n* Overall, King Gongmin was not as bad a ruler, but it seems that his ambiguous sexuality contributed to the delegitimizing of him in later records \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Choi Young*** and ***Yi Seong-gye*** \n\n* Two military generals played a central role in the later story. [**Choi Young**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Choe_Yeong)**,** a national hero who won many battles with his 2,000 Korean archers in the Red Turban Rebellion in Yuan China, was a loyal patriot. He restored some northern territories in the Korean peninsula in the reign of *Gongmin*. \n   * He came from a famous Confucian scholar family, and was known for his strict asceticism. His motto is still well known among Koreans - \"**Regard gold as nothing but mere stones**.\" \n   * One of the *darugachi*s (Yuan governors) of northern territories who surrendered to him was ethnic Korean [Yi Ja-chun](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yi_Ja-chun), and his son **Yi Seong-gye**. \n* [Yi Seong-gye](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taejo_of_Joseon) grew up to be an excellent military general, and repelled various foreign invasions - the remnants of Mongols, Red Turban rebels from China, and [Japanese pirates](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wokou) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Young king orders his generals to attack Ming China** \n\n* King Gongmin's son was enthroned at a young age. Ill-advised and inexperienced, he ordered his young general *Yi Seong-gye* to attack Ming China. \n* *Yi Seong-gye* opposed the expedition from the beginning, though. He cited four reasons \n\n1. A smaller nation should not attack a larger nation, as it goes against the Confucian order of the world \n2. It is harsh to campaign during the summer farming season, as it will result in a poor harvest for the populace\n3. With the bulk of the men away to the north, Japanese pirates will have free rein in the south\n4. Monsoon rains will reduce the effectiveness of composite bows, the army's main weapon, and will encourage the spread of infectious diseases in the camps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wihwado Retreat, and the killing of Choi Young and the king of Goryeo** \\[1388\\] \n\n* Despite Yi's opposition, the king sent his army to China. However, on the way to China **in an island in Yalu River (Korea-China border)**, Yi decided to **return to the capital of Goryeo and make a coup d'\u00e9tat**. This event is well-known among Koreans as [Wihwado Retreat](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wihwado_Retreat). \n* *Choi Young*, the loyal general and former supervisor of Yi, defended the capital and royal court from Yi's army. However, he was eventually defeated, exiled, and later killed. He famously said that \"grass would never grow on my grave\" \n   * He became a popular marshall god in Korean shamanism later on \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Killing of Jung Mong-ju** \\[1392\\] \n\n* After the coup, Yi did not ascend to throne right away. He placed two puppet kings between the period of 1388-1392. Yi was well supported by most aristocrats and the general populace, but there were a few prominent **loyalists** for ideological (Confucian) reasons. \n* Yi tried to **win over Goryeo loyalists**, and did many of his operations with his [ambitious third son](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taejong_of_Joseon). *Yi Bang-won*, the third son, sent a [famous poem](https:\/\/www.donga.com\/en\/article\/all\/20070630\/253839\/1) to [Jeong Mong-ju](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeong_Mong-ju), the most famous loyalist: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What's a big deal: this or that?  \n>  \n>What's a big deal even if the mountain\u2019s kudzu vines become tangled?  \n>  \n>We\u2019ll be tangled like this and long live and prosper \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen the loyalist replied in a poem: \n\n>Though I die and die again a hundred times,  \n>  \n>That my bones turn to dust, whether my soul remains or not,  \n>  \n>Ever loyal to my Lord, how can this red heart ever fade away?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this*, Yi Bang-won* (the third son) invited *Jeong* (the loyalist) to a banquet. On the way home from the banquet **at night,** ***Jeong*** **was murdered by five men on the** ***Seonjuk Bridge*** (\"Good Bamboo Bridge\") \n\n* It is said that you can still see his blood on the bridge. The bridge is in the capital of Goryeo, in present-day North Korea \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Yi Seong-gye* soon deposed the king, and **crowned himself as the founder of a new dynasty,** ***Joseon***. \\[1392\\] \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe history of Joseon is extremely well documented - both in classical Chinese (official court records) and vernacular Korean with the invent of the Korean writing system in 1443. \n\n* Much of Goryeo royalty was executed. It is said in Korea that **anyone with the last name** ***Wang*** **was killed**, or changed their last name to survive. \n* The [extant official historical record](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goryeosa) about *Goryeo* was written in Joseon dynasty - it is said that the history written by the Goryeo dynasty themselves was burned and abandoned later. Thus, current scholarship tends to be careful about potential biases in the record. \n* The *Goryeo-Joseon* transition is one of the most dramatized events in pre-modern Korean history, so the description was a bit lengthy.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1663115629.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/xdyx0a\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

Based on their actions, the entire continent essentially seemed like one big property split amongst very few families, with relatives going off to rule distant and quite disparate lands- one uncle off to Spain, a daughter to Holland, a cousin to Austria, a brother to England, and so on and so forth.\n\nMy confusion is this: the cultures of these countries vary widely from one another. Music, food, language, traditions, climate, etc. etc. etc. are all quite different. It's hard for me to imagine so few bloodlines\/families just comfortably picking up and moving to run a country that's so different or, if they did integrate, far flung relatives coming together from these lands and being culturally compatible. In essence, all the thrones seemed to be involved in a huge game of musical chairs with very few families playing, but said thrones were in such different cultural locations. How did it work? There are three explanations I can come up with...\n\n1. The ruling elite did not, in fact, integrate well with the local cultures. An Austrian princess sent to Spain remained, in essence, an Austrian. The vast differences in the root cultures did not really permeate the personal culture of the monarchs.\n2. The royals were much broader in education, exposure, and behavior than people today, such that said Austrian princess could float comfortably between Andalusia and the courts of Vienna, or any other number of places, without appearing or feeling out of place. Linguistically I could see this, but culturally I'm having a hard time buying it.\n3. Somewhat a combination of 1. and 2., there was a different high general culture, a court one I suppose, that was universal across these lands and that's all that really mattered. These families all followed more or less a pan-continental culture of the nobility, and with minor help from translators and whatnot, could rule the different regional people.\n\nBasically if you've spent any time with people from, say, England, Spain, and France, you'd see my confusion.

Vind. hist. gr. 73\\], they were discovered four palimpsest leaves \\[8 pages\\], which they were hiding some greek writing. Till my readings, the 6 out of 8 pages have been deciphered in some sufficient way, and they have been divided in 3 parts \\[Empire in Crisis \\[2020\\], pp. 8-9\\]. All scholars agree that the texts should be from Dexippus' Scythica of the 3rd c.

Fragment Ia\u2013Ib, fol. 195rv \\[two pages\\]**\n\nThe excerpt actually describes some preliminary war tactics by Cniva \\[the Gothic general & king of the 3rd c. CE\\] trying to take some Thracian city; which it has been identified by the scholars as Philippopolis, besieged and taken in 250 CE.\n\n\\_\\*an english translation of the 1st page 195r in Martin & Gruskov\u00e1 \\[2014b\\], p. 737 \/\/ and a german translation of 2nd page 195v in Gruskov\u00e1 & Martin \\[2015\\], p. 39\n\n>The Scythians \\[=Goths\\] withdrew pretending that they abandoned the siege, so to confuse the Thracians, and camped some distance away. And it seems that the besieged believed it and relaxed somehow. However, a traitor approached Cniva and promised to show to him the spot of the city's fortifications, which would be passed more easily. Cniva picked 5 volunteers and sent them at night so to confirm the information; he actually had also set prizes. The Thracian guards were drunk or asleep and the 5 Scythians managed to remove them and pass. Then they gave a signal with a torch and 500 men of Cniva tried to enter the city with ladders, but the Thracians noticed them...\n\n\"*the identification of the town as Philippopolis is possible and plausible, though by no means certain.*\" Gruskov\u00e1 & Martin \\[2014b\\], p. 748\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**b. Fragment IIa\u2013IIb, fol. 194rv \\[two pages\\]**\n\nIf I understood well, the first page of this text \\[194r\\] had some more difficulties regarding deciphering. In any case it seems describing some war preparations by Roman emperor Decius against Goths, but after the fall of Philippopolis in 250 CE.\n\n\\_\\*a german translation of 1st page 194r in Gruskov\u00e1 & Martin \\[2014c\\], p. 33 \/\/ and an english translation of 2nd page 194v in Gruskov\u00e1 & Martin \\[2014b\\], p. 736\n\n>Ptolemeus the Athenian was set by the emperor to guard the area between Macedonia and Thessaly. And Athenians, Boeotians and some selected Lacedaimonians  gathered  at the narrow and safer passage of Thermopylae, probably waiting for the enemy. Here the text doesn't seem crystal clear. Nevertheless, most possibly the leader of the Scythians \\[=Goths\\], named Ostroggouthos, was informed that the Scythians took Philippopolis and that Cniva was praised for it. So under some pressure to accomplish a similar achievement, he started marching against Decius with 50000 men.  \n>  \n>Decius gathered 80000 soldiers and waited at Amissos near Beroina \\[?\\]. When he was informed that Ostroggouthos' army was near, he decided to speak to his men. He tried to reanimate their spirit, saying that they shouldn't be discouraged by some recent misadventure in the nearby field and the defeat at Thrace \\[Philippopolis\\], but they should accept reality like prudent men. Because the first failure \\[in the nearby field at Beroina\\] came cause of the scouts, while the Thracian city was lost by ambushes...\n\nAs Philippopolis is taken and Decius is still alive, the narrated events should be placed somewhere between, 250-251 CE.\n\nThe historic elements of this excerpt have been mostly compared with the Jordanes' Getica of the 6th c. CE, then with Syncellus' Ekloge chronographias of the 8th-9th c. CE. The latter is using as source Dexippus, as it's stated in the work.\n\nIn Jordanes \\[Get. 101\\], when the king Ostrogotha died it seems that Cniva took afterwards the leadership of the Goths. If both accounts are accurate, this would mean that Cniva maybe served for sometime as general under Ostrogotha's command; though there could be some anachronisms. \\[Regarding leader Ostroggouthos: \"*It occurs otherwise only in Latin sources: see in particular Jord. Get. 98\u2013100, where the form Ostrogotha is used.*\", Gruskov\u00e1 & Martin \\[2014b\\], p. 740\\].\n\nRegarding the toponyms Amissos & Beroina, where Decius waited and gave his speech \\[Gruskov\u00e1 & Martin \\[2014b\\], p. 740\\]:\n\n\"*The text may contain (an) unknown geographical name(s) or corrupted known name(s).*\" But adding: \"*an association may immediately suggest itself with Beroea in Thracia (\u0392\u1f73\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 or \u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u1f79\u03b7, Beroea, Beroa, or Berone of the Tabula Peutingeriana VIII 2), the town where Cniva ambushed Decius several months before the moment when our passage is set*\".\n\nIt's probably related with the misadventure in the nearby field at Beroina, that Decius mentions in his speech; i.e. a previous failure at Beroa. Jordanes \\[Get. 102\\] had written that Decius faced unsuccessfully Cniva there, but in a course of events that would place it after Ostrogotha's death; possible anachronism.\n\n\\* Thermopylae are given as 'gates' \\[\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\\] in the greek text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**c. Fragment IIIb\u2013IIIc, fol. 192v+193r \\[two pages\\]**\n\nMaybe the most confusing excerpt regarding dating and identification of the mentioned persons.\n\n\\_\\*an english translation of both pages 192v+193r in Mallan & Davenport \\[2015\\], p. 205ff\n\n>After an unsuccessful try to besiege the city of Thessalonica, the Scythians \\[=Goths\\] decided to march against Athens and Achaea aiming for the loot. When the news were heard, the Greeks started to be gathered at the narrow coastal passage of Thermopylae, carrying spears, axes, or whatever each could & then fortifying an already existing wall. Afterwards the generals were elected: Marianus, who had been previously chosen by the Roman emperor to govern Greece south of Thermopylae, Philostratus the Athenian, and Dexippus the Boeotian \\[possibly not our historian\\]. And in order to to encourage the men, Marianus gave a speech. According to its start \\[which is the only that has been read\\], he tried to remind to the Greeks the importance of the place of Thermopylae during previous battles, like in the Persian wars \\[480 BCE\\], the Lamian war \\[323 BCE\\] & against Antiochus under Roman leadership \\[191 BCE\\]...\n\nThe text unfortunately stops before some battle. Syncellus \\[Ecl.Chron. 466\\] is also speaking of a military force gathering at Thermopylae, after a successful defense at Thessalonica, in the years of Gallienus. Neither there a battle followed. And it's noticeable that comparing this text with the previous one of the Decius' years, Thermopylae should be considered a good spot for defense. However, here an encouraging speech to the soldiers was given and generals were elected. While it has been noted eg. a successful defense in Achaea during the years of Gallienus \\[HA Gall. 6.1\\].\n\n\\*Thermopylae are given here, too, as 'gates' \\[\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\\] in the greek deciphered text. While with its complete name in Syncellus.\n\nGenerally he text has been compared mainly with Syncellus' Ekloge chronographias of the 8th-9th c. CE. & Historia Augusta, Gallieni duo. But other sources too, like Zosimus & Zonaras.\n\nOne other point that I've noticed is how general Marianus was identifying the Greco-Romans, to whom he spoke; i.e. with the Greeks defending against Persians in the 5th c. BCE, with the anti-Macedonian league who defeated Antipater in 323 BCE & with some united-said Greco-Roman forces who fought against Antiochus in 191 BCE. Noticeable that it isn't mentioned the case of 279 BCE, when mainly the Aetolians faced the Celts. However, here only the start of the speech is surviving.\n\nOn the possible dating I've read various aspects placing the events mainly during the reign of Gallienus \\[253-268 CE\\], in a length of about 16 years; i.e. 253\/4, 259, 262, 267\/8 \\[the latter however being more doubtful\\]; and this I presume has roots in the identification of the persons \\[like general Marianus\\] and the parallel reading of the rest sources \\[check Martin & Gruskov\u00e1 \\[2014a\\], Mallan & Davenport \\[2015\\], p. 215, Potter \\[2016\\], p. 336, Boteva \\[2020\\], p. 207\\].\n\n* \"... *the defeat of the Goths in (most likely) 262\/263, by the population of Achaea under the leadership of Marianus, Philostratus, and the Boeotian Dexippus*\".

It seems now that the available late-antique and Byzantine texts cannot be of further help when trying to reason which one of the two years was really marked by the Scythians\u2019 (to use the language of the palimpsest) unsuccessful siege of Thessalonica and by the urgent organization of the defence of Thermopylae*\". Boteva \\[2020\\], p. 207\n* \"*... I now think that it is wisest to be somewhat agnostic and recognize the possibility that the events at Thermopylae may be earlier than the siege and capture of Philippopolis in 250, but that too is problematic as the Gothic operations still seem quite distant from Thermopylae*\".

It began almost two and a half million years ago and ended about 5 thousand years ago.\n\nAt the end of the Stone Age, all ice ages ended long ago and the climate became very similar to the modern one. People of that time reached perfection in the construction of dwellings, the manufacture of tools from stone, bone, and wood.\n\nThey have learned to live in one place for a long time and rationally use natural resources for food. Therefore, at the end of the Stone Age, in the Eneolithic era, large settlements with long-term dwellings appeared. These were good buildings where people lived for decades.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the remains of more than a dozen such settlements in the Southern Urals, Southern Bashkiria and Northern Kazakhstan. Judging by the ceramic utensils, tools, stone processing technique, this territory was occupied by a population with similar households.\n\nSome villages were inhabited only during the summer or winter season, and many of them were inhabited all year round. The settlements became especially crowded in autumn and winter. In autumn, they repaired roofs and built new dwellings, in winter they organized joint hunts for large animals: wild horses, bison, saigas. Prosperous hunting and good housing were a guarantee of survival in the harsh steppe climate.\n\nThe largest, long-term and all-season settlement of this era was discovered on the banks of the steppe river Iman-Burluk in northern Kazakhstan. Archaeologists called this settlement Botai. There once stood more than two hundred dwellings, which occupied an area of \u200b\u200babout 8 hectares. The settlement was founded between the 4th and 3rd millennium BC and existed for at least 100 years.\n\nThey began to build their first dwellings along the stream in the valley. On the south side, a small village was protected by a steep bank of a steppe river, and from the north, forested hills.\n\nYears passed and the population of the village grew, and new ones were added to the old dwellings. Original \"quarters\" were formed, in which there were up to three dozen buildings. Between them lay \"streets\" up to 8 m wide and up to 50 m long.\n\nThe smallest dwelling had an area of \u200b\u200b20 square meters, and the largest - 75. In the center on the floor there was usually a recess for the hearth. Often there were traces of another hearth nearby. It probably served for additional heating in the coldest winters. Hearths served not only for heating, but also for cooking and firing pottery.\n\nIn the depths of the room, under the wall, there was usually a pit-cellar for storing food.\n\nMost of the finds were found on the floor near the hearth, on the side opposite from the entrance, or in niches in clay walls. That is, the ancient inhabitants spent most of their time at the hearth, and kept their household utensils in the niches of the walls. The space to the left and right of the entrance was occupied by beds for sleeping.\n\nIn the explored part of the Botai settlement, a collection of stone axes, flint and jasper tips, scrapers, piercers, drills and many other tools was collected. Dishes were restored from hundreds of fragments of ceramics. Only in the investigated part of the settlement (10% of the total area) were found bones from 133 thousand horses. In addition, the bones of foxes, wolves, dogs, bison, deer, bears, beavers and other animals are well preserved on the floor and around the dwellings.\n\nAt that time, the population had already formed beliefs and rituals. This is evidenced by the finds under the \"threshold\" at the entrance of some dwellings of the burial of the skull of a horse or dog. And sometimes both together. It is likely that the horse was a symbol of good prey, and the dog was a ghostly guardian of the dwelling.\n\nIn one of the dwellings in a wall niche, archaeologists found a human skull covered with red clay. Perhaps it was the skull of a shaman worshiped by the tribesmen. Three holes were drilled in this skull during the life of a person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLITERATURE:\n\nZaibert V.F.

That Nelson Mandela and the ANC was allied with the Soviet Union or that they were part of the Non-aligned coalition?","author":"Anglicanpolitics123","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/xae07u\/when_it_comes_to_cold_war_history_and_its\/","text":"During the history of the Cold War there were 2 camps that emerged. First was the camp of the West and its allies, especially the N.A.T.O alliance. And the Soviet Bloc and its allies in the communist alliance. Then you had a 3rd section called the Non Aligned movement. Leaders such as Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Egypt's Nasser, Tito from Yugoslavia. Then you have a complicated factor in this history and that is leaders who had one foot in one of the Cold War camps and another foot in the non aligned movement. For example Castro was on paper a Soviet ally. But under his leadership Cuba was also part of the Non aligned movement, with him being the general secretary from 1979-1983. On the other side of this coin Suharto of Indonesia was a Western ally. But at the same time kept Indonesia in the non aligned movement. Nehru of India was non aligned but India leaned more to the Soviet side during his leadership.\n\nNow when you add Nelson Mandela and his organisation the ANC into this complicated mix its interesting. Because he and the ANC initially sought assistance from the United States in the apartheid struggle. But they were turned down in 1960 according to him(that was during the Eisenhower Administration). Later they sought assistance from the Soviet Union and especially Cuba and they received it. In 1961 when Che Guevara published his classic on guerilla warfare Mandela and the ANC leaders incorporated it into the doctrines of the military wing the formed called UmKhonto Wesizwe(Spear of the Nation). In 1962 Che met Spear of a Nation fighters. Before this Oliver Tambo(who would serve as leader of the ANC in exile when Mandela was imprisoned) would visit the Soviet Union to have advisers train ANC fighters and also developed ties with the East German government. Later on when when the South African border war developed in the various theatres such as Angola, Namibia, and Zambia the ANC allied with the independence fighters their as well as the Cuban armed forces and the MPLA marxists in Angola, receiving training in Cuban training camps present as well as participating with Cuban regulars in the theatres of war against the apartheid regimes military.\n\nAt the same time the ANC maintain ties with some Western countries where they could get support such as the Swedish government, the Australian government and especially the Canadian government. Canada is interesting too because Mandela and the ANC developed ties under Canada's conservative governments(John Diefenbaker and Brian Mulroney). Furthermore Mandela emphasised repeatedly the ANC's independence in terms of its relations with foreign nations and a bigger bulk of his support came from Third world nations who at the time were explicitly non aligned such as Ben Bella's Algeria or Nasser's Egypt. So would Mandela and the ANC fall more in the Soviet camp or the non aligned camp from a historical perspective?","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1662778070.0},{"title":"Queen Elizabeth II has died, Buckingham Palace announces","author":"Welshhoppo","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-61585886","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1662660389.0},{"title":"Stone Age humans had unexpectedly advanced medical knowledge, new discovery suggests","author":"ELPOEPETIHWKCUFEYA","url":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/09\/07\/asia\/earliest-amputation-borneo-scn\/index.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1662576660.0},{"title":"The mystery of the human sacrifices buried in Europe's bogs","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20220907-the-mystery-of-the-human-sacrifices-buried-in-europes-bogs","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1662619496.0},{"title":"The British-era colonel revered in India state","author":"spark8000","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-62816672.amp","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1662640604.0},{"title":"Why were Lancasters rich (Discussion\/Question)","author":"Furno321","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/x96jmf\/why_were_lancasters_rich_discussionquestion\/","text":"Bear with me, most of my knowledge of English history comes from Real Royalty, Extra History Kings and Generals from youtube and from public forums.\n\nSo, I've had recently learned that one of the sons of Edward III got himself and nice duchy of Lancaster through his marriage with his wife and became one of the richest men in England.

The same practice existed in ancient China too.\n      * Buyeo's highest officials were named after six animals - The House of Horse, The House of Ox, The House of Pig, The House of Dog, etc.\n   * It seems that in the Northern states, **early arranged marriage** was common - in Okjeo (a small Northeastern kingdom), a **child-bride** would live with the child-groom's family until adulthood, while in Goguryeo (a Northern kingdom), a **child-groom** would live with his future wife's family to help their work\n   * In the small chiefdoms in the Southern part of the peninsula, each state had a sacred district called Sodo, where **spirits were worshipped through rituals using a pole attached with a rattle and drum**. The district was sacred and was independent of the boundaries of political administration. It functioned as **asylums for refugees and criminals**, a sacred place unreached by secular authority.\n      * A ritual song from one of the Southern chiefdoms survived. It goes:\n\n>Turtle, turtle, stick out your head  \n>  \n>If you do not, we'll roast and eat you\n\n* lol this song was obviously from an era when life was simpler and more mystical. There's also a hypothesis that the language spoken in this Southern region (Gaya) was closer to Japonic, rather than Koreanic languages.\n* Other folk traditions such as **stone fight** ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seokjeon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seokjeon)) and Ganggangsullae (**women dancing in a circle under the full moon**) ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ganggangsullae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ganggangsullae)) might have originated from this ancient time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wars, battles, and** ***Baekje*****'s peak**\n\n* [Samguk Sagi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samguk_Sagi) (History of Three Kingdoms - ***Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla***), compiled in 1145 by a Korean scholar based on previous records (which are lost now), provides quite detailed stories of wars and battles. According to this, the small Korean kingdoms were **constantly warring with each other**, as well as Chinese, northern nomadic, and Japanese kingdoms.\n* [The founder of Baekje](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Onjo_of_Baekje), the son of a *Goguryoe* king, went to the **southwestern part of the peninsula** and conquered the pre-existing smaller kingdoms. A king **committed suicide**, asking his enemy to take care of his people with **kindness and mercy**.\n* Around 350 AD, *Baekje* thrived from **triangle trade** between Liao peninsula of China, Kyushu island of Japan, and the Korean peninsula.\n* At the same time, the northern kingdom *Goguryeo* moved its capital southwards to modern-day **Pyongyang** because of the attacks from Northern nomadic tribes. This caused a conflict with *Baekje* in the south, and ultimately the *Goguryeo* king **was killed** at Pyongyang castle.\n   * *Baekje* also engaged in constant small battles with *Silla*, stealing and being stolen castles.\n* *Baekje* had **a close tie with the emerging ancient kingdom in Japan**. It is said that *Baekje*'s scholar [Wang-in\/Wani](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wani_(scholar)) introduced the Chinese writing system and Confucian classics to Japan. *Baekje*'s king also gave a [seven-branched ceremonial sword](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seven-Branched_Sword) to Japan's ruler\n   * Japan claims that this was a tribute from *Baekje* to Japan, while Korea claims that this was a generous gift from *Baekje*'s king. East Asian ancient history is funny - a 1,700 years old artifact is still the subject of intense emotional debates.\n* Around 380 AD, **an** [**Indian Buddhist monk**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marananta) came to *Baekje* via China. *Baekje*'s king welcomed him in the palace, and soon **adopted Buddhism** and constructed a Buddhist temple.\n\n\\*\\* Around this time, *Silla* was still not much more than a federation of small city-states, ruled by three clans in turn - *Park, Seok, and Kim* clans. The early records of *Silla* implies a close (both [friendly](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talhae_of_Silla) and hostile) relationship with Japan. Its early ruler exchanged envoys with [Queen Himiko](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adalla_of_Silla), but later Japan frequently [invaded](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heulhae_of_Silla) Silla\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The rise of** ***Goguryeo*****, and decline of** ***Baekje***\n\n* Around 370 AD, *Goguryeo* was seriously weakened. In order to suppress tribalism that weakened the kingdom, a [new king](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sosurim_of_Goguryeo) integrated Confucian ideologies into political institutions - by (1)  establishing **schools** for the children of nobility (2) i**ntroducing** [**Confucian laws**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ritsury%C5%8D) **and codifying regional customs** (3) adopting Buddhism for religious life.\n* The next king successfully attacked *Baekje* and formed an alliance with *Baekje*'s neighbor, *Silla*, which was still a small emerging state.\n* The next king, [**Gwanggaeto the Great**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwanggaeto_the_Great)**,** significantly **expanded the territory into Manchuria** and **into the southern part of the Korean peninsula**, conquering present-day Seoul.\n   * He defeated proto-Mongolic kingdoms and **regained the ancient territory of Gojoseon**. He also annexed the remainder of *Buyeo*, the northernmost Koreanic kingdom. He built a large empire, and left [**the largest engraved stele**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gwanggaeto_Stele) in the world.\n   * He also protected *Silla* from the attack of *Baekje-*Japan alliance. He made hostage a *Silla* prince, and made him the king of *Silla* later on.\n* *Gwanggaeto the Great* died at the age of 39, but his son *Jangsu* **reigned for 79 years until the age of 98** \\- **the longest reign** in East Asian history. He changed the name of the country to **Goryeo, from which Korea originated**.\n   * He successfully managed complicated diplomatic relationships with Chinese, Mongolic, and Tungusic dynasties that were warring with each other (\\* There was no unified Chinese state at this time.) Now he tried to conquer *Baekje, Silla, and Gaya* (a small federation of city-states between Baekje and Silla) in the southern part of the peninsula\n* By this time, *Baekje* was significantly weakened. It already lost a big part of its former territory to *Gugoryeo*. It was put in a weaker position vis-a-vis its old ally Japan. Political chaos ensued, and [brothers killed each other](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeonji_of_Baekje) for the throne\n* The *Goguryeo* king sent a **Buddhist monk as a spy** to *Baekje*'s palace in modern-day Seoul. The Buddhist monk **played** ***go*** with t*he Baekje king* every day, and talked him into spending money in expensive construction projects.\n   * With the information from the monk, the *Goguryeo* king invaded *Baekje*, **conquered the capital (modern-day Seoul), burned it to the ground,** and **slew the** ***Baekje*** **king**. The whole *Baekje* nobles ran southwards, retaining a small territory in Southwestern Korea\n\n\\*\\* *Silla* was still a small peripheral country in the southeastern part of the Korean peninsula, protected by the [mountain ranges](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sobaek_Mountains) that surround it.

They (1) took the Chinese royal title 'wang' (=king), (2) adopted Buddhism\n   * In a famous legend, a Buddhist monk named I cha-don sacrificed his life, **with white blood spurting from his throat**. After this miracle, *Silla* aristocrats got terrified and accepted Buddhism\n* With the help of their ally *Silla*, [a new Baekje king](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seong_of_Baekje) was able to restore the central part of Korea. However, a Silla king [Jin-heung](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jinheung_of_Silla), under a secret agreement with *Goguryeo*, attacked unexpecting *Baekje* army and took the central part of Korea. **Furious with the betrayal**, the *Baekje king* attacked *Silla*, but it turned out to be a disastrous battle - the ***baekje*** **king and 30,000 of soldiers got killed**.\n   * After this, *Baekje* got almost irreversibly weak. The **slain king's two brothers, one son, and two grandsons all left to Japan** at some point, starting their own clan there.\n      * [One of these men](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prince_Asa) became the teacher of [Prince Shotoku](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prince_Sh%C5%8Dtoku), a famous, semi-legendary Japanese **regent** who systemized Japanese administration and promoted Buddhism. It is said that he made a portrait of Prince Shotoku at Horyu-ji temple, an important temple in the old Japanese capital. [A brother of his](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prince_Imseong) became the ancestor of [Ouchi clan](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%C5%8Cuchi_clan) in Western Japan \n   * The *Silla* king erected an engraved stele for himself, and organized a youth warrior group called **\"**[**Flowering nights**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hwarang)**\"**\n      * Which is often associated with Greek-style homosexuality later on\n* For a while, both *Baekje and Silla* had a weird phase. A Buddhist *Baekje* king announced complete ban on all killings, hunting, and butchering. A *Silla* king was dethroned by his mother because he refused to marry his aunt (his mother's sister).\n* [A Baekje king](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mu_of_Baekje) is known to have married a *Silla* princess, despite the intense rivalry between the two kingdoms. The legend says that when the young prince fell in love with the princess, he disguised as a commoner in *Silla*, and **taught** ***Silla*****'s children a song**, handing them out **(edible) sweet kudzu**. The song survived as a poem:\n\n>Princess Seonhwa, after a secret affair,  \n>  \n>Steals away at night, with Seodong in her arms\n\n* The legend says that the children **spread this song in** ***Silla*****'s capital**, and the angry father of the princess kicked her out. Then the *Baekje* prince married her.\n\n\\*\\* During the similar time period, *Goguryeo*'s Princess [Pyongyang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Princess_Pyeonggang) also married an unconventional suitor - an \"ugly, dumb\" commoner called On-dal who became a general later.

In fact, *Goguryeo* successfully defended this. Famously, the *Goguryeo* general [Eulji Mundeok](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Salsu) defended against the Sui forces for months, **while secretly building a dam** at the Salsu River, cutting off the flow of water in the river. When the unsuspecting Sui troops were halfway across the river, Eulji opened the dam, **causing the onslaught of water to drown about 300,000 of Sui soldiers**. The *Goguryeo* cavalry then charged into the remaining Sui forces, inflicting enormous casualties. This is **one of the most legendary victories** in Korean history\n   * The failure of the Korean campaign brought down the short-lived Sui dynasty, to be replaced by Tang\n* However, this **also weakened** ***Goguryeo***\n   * After this, *Goguryeo* was building its own version of the **Great Wall**, but the royalty tried to kill a [young, popular general](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeon_Gaesomun) who was in charge of this. When the young general discovered the plot, he **threw a lavish banquet** and invited one hundred royalties and aristocrats. **At the banquet he slew all of them**, went to the place and **murdered the king**. After that, he enthroend a young nephew of the king.

There was no male heir in their royal caste (**\"sacred bone\" caste**) anymore\n* There was K[im Yu-sin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gim_Yu-sin), a renowned *Hwarang* **(Flowering Knight) warrior,** a commander of *Silla* army at the age of 34, and a cousin of the new queen. His bloodline was noble enough, and he could have revolted and claimed the crown. Instead he **stayed loyal to the queen, and was protective of her**.\n* [Queen Seondeok](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Queen_Seondeok_of_Silla) was the **second female sovereign in recorded East Asian history**. She's considered as a decent monarch, won the heart of people, and built many important **cultural monuments** that are **still tourist attractions** in the ancient city of Gyeongju after 1,400 years. However, most importantly, she was the first *Silla* monarch who decided to **form an alliance with the rising Tang dynasty**, while dealing with the constant attacks from *Baekje and Goguryeo*\n   * Some say that *Baekje and Goguryeo* attacked *Silla* more because they were **more emboldened by the female ruler** of the enemy\n   * **The Emperor of Tang did not take her seriously either** (because she's a woman), but with the threat from *Goguryeo*, he ultimately agreed that it was a good idea to form an alliance with *Silla*\n   * One of her highest officials also [plotted a rebellion](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Queen_Seondeok_of_Silla#Bidam's_rebellion) against her because \"**a woman should stop ruling.**\" However, Kim Yu-shin, the loyal Flowering Knight warrior and commander, calmed down the anxious queen and excellently took care of the rebellion. There's an interesting legend about the use of **astrology** here (if anyone's interested, click the link above)\n* After the two queens passed away, the first queen's nephew, [Kim Chun-chu](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muyeol_of_Silla) \\- who used to be the highest caste \"sacred bone\" but was degraded to \"true bone\" for a political reason - was **enthroned** with the support of his brother-in-law and friend K*im Yu-shin* (the Flowering Knight guy).\n   * There's an interesting [legend](https:\/\/world.kbs.co.kr\/service\/contents_view.htm?lang=e&menu_cate=culture&id=&board_seq=129745&page=4&board_code=akoreas_ani) about how the king married K*im Yu-shin*'s **sister**. Kim Yu-shin had two sisters, *Munhee and Bohee*. One night, Bohee, the older sister, had a dream where she urinated on the mountaintop until the urine flooded the entire capital city. Upon hearing the odd dream, Munhee instinctively knew that it was an auspicious dream, and suggested she buy the dream in exchange for a silk skirt. Bohee sold her dream immediately. Later, Munhee met and fell in love with *Kim Chun-chu*, and became the queen of unified *Silla* later on.\n      * There's more interesting details in the link. Kim Yu-shin was originally very upset about his sister's affair with *Kim Chun-chu* (because he already had a wife), and tried to burn her alive. **The queen was shocked to find it out, and saved his sister's life**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Fall of** ***Baekje***\n\n* Before he became the new king of *Silla*, K*im Chun-chu* had lost his daughter and son-in-law in a *Baekje* attack. Some say that he particularly wanted a **revenge** on this. He was already a good friend of the Emperor of Tang, and he constantly pleaded the emperor to send army to destroy *Baekje*. In 660 AD, the Emperor finanlly acquiesced and sent 130,000 soldiers through the sea.\n* *Kim Yu-shin*, the Flowering Knight commander, set out with his own 50,000 soldiers to *Baekje*, to rendezvous with the Tang army. *Baekje* court was **already corrupt and decadent**. Upon the news, only 5,000 soldiers and 1 general stayed to fight with the *Silla* army.\n   * In a famous story, [Gyebaek](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gyebaek), the last *Baekje* general, **killed his wife and children with his sword a night before his last battle** to prevent them from being enslaved\n   * In the battle of *Hwangsanbeol*, the 5,000 *Baekje* soldiers fought so fiercely they overwhelmed the 50,000 *Silla* army for a while. [In a legend](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Hwangsanbeol), a *Silla* general sent his **young Flowering Knight** son to fight the *Baekje* army single-handedly. The young warrior got captured and killed. With this sacrifice, the *Silla* army regained morale and destroyed the last army of *Baekje*.\n* There's a very famous legend in Korea that the last king of *Baekje*, Ui-ja, **jumped off a cliff with his three thousand court maidens**. Even though the story is not historically accurate, there's still a cliff called \"Falling Flowers Rock\" ([nak-hwa-am](https:\/\/folkency.nfm.go.kr\/en\/topic\/detail\/5467)) in the southewest part of Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Lots of *Baekje* royal family and nobles fled to Japan - some already left for Japan even before the fall of *Baekje*. Some say that this mass migration impacted the language and culture of **the emerging Japanese ruling class\/ aristocracy**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There's one surviving song\/poem from *Baekje*, recorded in a 14th century Korean [book ](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Akhak_gwebeom)\\- it's a song of a **peddler's wife**, having a nocturnal thought about his safety\n\n>\\[The Song of *Jeong-eup*\\]  \n>  \n>Moon, rise high up and beam far away.  \n>  \n>(chant) eogui ya eogangdyoli, a-heu, a-eu darong diri  \n>  \n>Are you now in the market street, I fear you may step on mud  \n>  \n>(chant) eogui ya eogangdyoli  \n>  \n>Lay your luggage down, I fear darkness may fall on you  \n>  \n>(chant) eogui ya eogangdyoli, a-eu darong diri\n\n\\*\\* *Jeong-eup* is a provincial town that still exists in the southwest part of Korea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Fall of Goguryeo, and the Unified Silla's War with Tang China**\n\n* While there are many tragic folktales about *Baekje*'s fall, there are not so many about the fall of *Goguryeo*. The once-powerful *Goguryeo* got into a downward spiral when *Yeon Gaesomun*, the despotic general who enthroned a puppet king, died. His sons and brothers got caught up in nasty power struggles, and the Emperor of Tang did not miss the opportunity. In 668 AD, the Tang army put Pyongyang under siege in concert with the Silla army. Most factions in *Goguryeo* surrendered - that was the end of the once powerful state.\n   * A son of a *Goguryeo* noble became an important general in Tang dynasty ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gao\\_Xianzhi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gao_Xianzhi)), taking part in Tang's multiple expeditions to Pamir Mountains and the border with Muslim caliphates\n* After the fall of *Baekje and Goguryeo*, the new, Unified Silla's major concern was how to push the Tang army out of the Korean peninsula, which tried to stay and set up a Protectorate. The Tang Emperor's original intention was to create a Profectorate and to place the entire peninsula under Tang's rule.\n* [A new Silla king](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Munmu_of_Silla), Kim Chun-chu's son and Kim Yu-sin's nephew, started a new war with Tang China. After about 7 years of struggle, the *Silla* army won a decisive victory against the Tang forces in the c[entral part](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Maeso) of Korea. Losing interest, the Tang Emperor ordered withdrawal from the Korean peninsula. This is considered the major victory in the *Unified Silla*'s history\n* King Munmu, who achieved this victory, was worshipped as a deity after his death. He famously left the words at his death bed \"**Cremate my remains and scatter the ashes in the sea** where the whales live. **I will become a dragon and thwart foreign invasion**\" - his ash was scattered from a rock islet that overlooks the East Sea\/Sea of Japan.\n   * Another legend says that King Munmu and the general Kim Yu-Sin (who was also worshipped as a deity in shamanism after death) appeared in the next king's dream and said: \"Blowing on a **bamboo flute** will calm the heavens and the earth.\" After waking up, the king rode out to the sea, and indeed found a bamboo flute. It is said that the blowing of this bamboo flute invoked the spirits of King Munmu and General Gim Yu-sin and would push back enemy troops, cure illnesses, and bring and halt rain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Surviving poems from** ***Silla***\n\nAfter the fall of *Baekje* and subsequent [fall of Goguryeo](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeon_Gaesomun#Death), *Silla*'s capital *Gyeongju (Gyerim)* in the southeastern part of Korea became the center of the old Koreanic culture\n\nThere are about 25 surviving *Silla* poems, written in some [Koreanized Chinese writing system](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hyangga) (e.g. Chinese writing system written in Korean word order with a few grammatical particles added)\n\n* A common theme was the **moon, Buddhist serenity, Enlightenment, loss and grief**, and the beauty of nature\n   * Moon is such a typical subject, there's even a movie titled \"The Moon Night of *Silla*\" (which is 90s' comedy though, lol)\n\nThis article provides great translations of these poems: [https:\/\/www.worldhistory.org\/article\/970\/15-complete-hyangga-songs-from-ancient-korea\/](https:\/\/www.worldhistory.org\/article\/970\/15-complete-hyangga-songs-from-ancient-korea\/) I'm just copying some of them here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"**Prayer to Amitayus**\"  \n>  \n>O moon, go to the West, and pray to Amitayus  \n>  \n>And tell that there is one who adotes the judicial throne,  \n>  \n>and longs for the Pure Land, praying before him with folded hands.  \n>  \n>Ah, would he leave me outstanding when he fulfills the forty-eight vows?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"**Requiem for the dead sister**\"  \n>  \n>On the hard road of life and death that is near our land,  \n>  \n>You went, afraid, without words.  \n>  \n>We know not where we go  \n>  \n>Leaves blown, scattered, though fallen from the same tree, by the first winds of autumn.  \n>  \n>Ah, I will polish the path, until I meet you in the Pure Land.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"**Ode to Knight Kipa**\"  \n>  \n>The moon that pushes her way through the thickets of clouds,  \n>  \n>Is she not pursuing the white clouds?  \n>  \n>Knight Kipa once stood by the water, reflecting his face in the Iro.  \n>  \n>Henceforth I shall seek and gather among pebbles the depth of his mind.  \n>  \n>Knight, you are the towering pine that scorns frost, ignores snow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>(part of a Buddhist poem)  \n>  \n>Ah, how happy is a moonlit autumn field, ripe with the fruit of knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n'**Dedication of the Flower**' was sung by an old herdsman. One day the herdsman meets Lady Suro, wife of Lord Sunjong, and her entourage touring the countryside. The lady asks for an azealea flower growing on a high cliff, but the only person to respond is the herdsman. Giving Lady Suro the flower he sings:\n\n>If you would let me leave the cattle tethered to the brown rock, and feel no shame for me,  \n>  \n>I would pluck and dedicate the flowers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"**Song of Choyong**\" is perhaps the most famous of all these *Silla* poems. The title character is the son of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea who one night after a party returns home to find his **beautiful wife being seduced by the Spirit of Smallpox**. Choyong was forgiving, though, and in return, the spirit promised **never to enter a house which had a portrait of him** on the door. Choyong has been identified as a shaman, or an epidemic god. This is the song which Choyong sang so charmingly to the spirit so that he left in peace:\n\n>Having caroused far into the night in the moonlit capital,  \n>  \n>I returned home and in my bed - Behold four legs  \n>  \n>Two were mine \\*; Whose are the other two?

Then they became the king and queen there. Silla lost the sun and moon when the couple disappeared into Japan. Later, the husband and wife (now the king and queen of Japan) sent a special silk cloth to Silla, so that Silla restores the sun and moon in the sky.\n\n**The legend of the Emilee Bell**\n\n* [The Bell of King Seongdeok](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bell_of_King_Seongdeok), the largest bronze bell in Korea made in 765, has a legend that a child was sacrificed in its casting. >!The bell weirdly did not ring, but a Buddhist monk had a dream that if a child is thrown into its cast, the bell would ring.

When he woke up the next morning, he discovered that the 'bowl' was a decomposing **skull full of decaying old water** and that he had **slept in a tomb**.  He was shocked, vomited and ran from the tomb \u2014 that was when **enlightenment came**. Upon realizing that values of things depend on individual perception, he abandoned his trip to China (\"now I got enlightenment, why should I go to China\") and returned his home Silla.

Scranton enlisted in Company E of the 56th New York Infantry Regiment at Middletown, New York on July 16, 1861, at the age of twenty. Although enlisting in a New York Regiment, Scranton had been born in Connecticut in 1841. The regiment mustered into service on September 1, 1861, in New York City and Scranton was appointed as a Sergeant. The 56th served in defending Washing, D.C. until March of 1862 when it was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 4th Corps of the Army of the Potomac.\n\nScranton served with his regiment at the Siege of Yorktown, the Battle of Williamsburg, the Battle of Seven Pines, the Seven Days Battles, the Battle of Gaines\u2019s Mill, the battle of Bottom\u2019s Bridge, the Battle of White Oak Swamp, and the Battle of Malvern Hill. In July 1862 the regiment was assigned to Harrison\u2019s Landing, where Scranton was promoted to First Sergeant of Company E before they were moved south where they participated in the Second Battle of Charleston in 1863.\n\nOn January 2, 1863, Scranton was commissioned a second lieutenant. He and the 56th continued to see action in South Carolina, fighting in the Battle of Honey Hill, the Battle of Tulifinny, the Battle of Deveaux\u2019s Neck, and the Battle of Coosawatchie.\n\nIn late December 1864, the regiment was assigned to Morris Island, SC. While there, Scranton was given a commission as a Captain in the 128th United States Colored Troops. After Scranton\u2019s transfer, the 56th New York would go on to serve in the Battle of Dingle\u2019s Mill and on occupation duty until being Mustered out on October 17, 1865.\n\nThe 128th United States Colored Troops was organized at Hilton Head, S.C. in April of 1865. Scranton was placed as the commanding officer of Company F. During an inspection on the 21st of June, 1865 at Camp Stanton in Beaufort, Company F soldier Private John Greer refused to clean his weapon stating: \u201cMy gun is as clean as any man\u2019s, and I\u2019ll be damned if I clean it until I see the Colonel.\u201d Scranton moved to arrest Greer with the assistance of Sergeant William Emory, and Greer tried to strike them. Greer was court-martialed and sentenced to three months of imprisonment and forfeiture of pay, time that he spent incarcerated at Fort Clinch, Florida.\n\nDuring his time stationed in Beaufort with the 128th, Scranton began living with and later marrying a \u201ccolored woman of bad reputation\u201d. Scranton was court-martialed on charges of miscegenation and sentenced to be discharged from the service. This verdict was upheld by Maj. Gen. Quincy Gilmore, in command of the Department of the South. Scranton was dismissed from the Service on September 7, 1865. Scranton is not the only white officer of the United States Colored Troops to marry a black woman. In January of 1866, a White Lieutenant named Thomas and his newlywed black bride returning to Ohio after his discharge were kicked off the steamboat Luminary on the Mississippi River and denied passage on another vessel.\n\nScranton and his wife, Ellen, raised four children in Connecticut until his death at 43 years old on July 19, 1884. Ellen would go on to apply for her husband\u2019s pension in 1891, before taking on work as a live-in housekeeper, eventually dying in December of 1909 at the age of 67. Five years before her death, in 1904, Private John Smith of the United States Army Hospital Service station at Fort Mott, New Jersey had been discharged \u201cfor the good of the service\u201d because of marrying a black woman. The discharge had been upheld by General Frederick Grant.\n\nSources:\nNew York, U.S., Civil War Muster Roll Abstracts, 1861-1900-\nU.S., Civil War Pension Index: General Index to Pension Files, 1861-1934\nU.S., Civil War Soldiers, 1861-1865\nU.S., Civil War Soldiers Records and Profiles, 1861-1865\nU.S., Find a Grave Index, 1600\u2019s-Current\nU.S. Colored Troops Military Service Records, 1863-1865\n(1865, September 18).

Hwanung, the son of the Emperor of Heaven, wished to descend from heaven and living the world of human beings. Knowing his son's desire, the Emperor of Heaven surveyed the three highest mountains and found Mount Taebaek the most suitable place for his son to settle and help human beings. ... Leading the Earl of Wind, the Master of Rain, and the Master of Clouds, he \\[Hwanung\\] took charge of some three hundred and sixty areas of responsibility, including agriculture, allotted life spans, illness, punishment, and good and evil, and brought culture to his people.  \n>  \n>At that time **a bear and a tiger** living in the same cave prayed to Holy Hwanung to transform them into human beings.

Both animals ate the spices and avoided the sun. After twenty-one days **the bear became a woman**, but the tiger, unable to observe the taboo, remained a tiger. Unable to find a husband, the bear-woman prayed under the alter tree for a child. Hwanung metamorphosed himself, **lay with her, and begot a son called Dangun** Wanggeom (the mythical king of Korea).  \n>  \n>In the fiftieth year of the reign of Emperor Yao (one of China's mythological founders), Dangun made **the walled city of Pyongyang** (not the modern day city) the capital and **called his country Joseon**. He then moved his capital to Asadal on Mount Paegak ... he later hid in Asadal as a mountain god at the age of one thousand nine hundred and eight.\n\n(Source: *Samguk Yusa or Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms*, one of the two oldest chronicles of the Korean history, written in 1281)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 surviving penal statutes**:\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eight\\_Prohibitions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eight_Prohibitions)\n\nChinese sources say that Gojoseon had 8 penal statutes called \"Eight Prohibitions.\" Only 3 of them are known now.\n\n* Those who commit murder shall be put to death immediately\n* Those who cause injury must compensate with grain.\n* Those who steal will be enslaved or pay recompense.\n\nwhich draws an interesting parallel to the earliest penal codes from other cultures (e.g. The Code of Hammurabi).\n\n(Source: Chinese source *The Book of Han*, written in 111)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSong <**My dear, don't cross the river** (Gongmudohaga \u516c\u7121\u6e21\u6cb3\u6b4c)>\n\nThis is the only surviving poem from Gojoseon, passed down in a Chinese source <\u53e4\u4eca\u6ce8> (written in 300 A.D.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dear, my dear, please don't cross that river  \n>  \n>Oh, my dear is now crossing the river  \n>  \n>Ah, he's drowned, he's gone  \n>  \n>What am I to do, what am I to do\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Chinese source also tells a heartbreaking background story:\n\n>One day a bargeman in Gojoseon was slowly rowing in the river. Then **a madman with grey hair walked into the river** with a bottle of liquor in his hand. His wife was chasing after him to stop him. He ignored her and kept going until **he was swept away, and drowned**. In despair, the wife took out her Gong-hu (a string instrument) and started singing. **The song was unspeakably sad**. Then **she followed her husband into the river and drowned**. The bargeman came back home and told his wife about this story and the song. She cried and sang the song with her Gong-hu, and everyone who heard the song shed tears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit: there's a famous modern interpretation of this song by musician Lee Sang-eun [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1\\_zYhn6bzR0](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1_zYhn6bzR0))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bronze daggers and dolmens**\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liaoning\\_bronze\\_dagger\\_culture](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liaoning_bronze_dagger_culture)\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gojoseon#Dolmen\\_Tombs](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gojoseon#Dolmen_Tombs)\n\nThe historical records of Gojoseon are supported by archaeological sites found in modern-day Manchuria and North Korea. The culture is characterized by large dolmen tombs and mandolin-shaped bronze daggers, among others.\n\n* Traditional Korean folk culture has a strong shamanic element, and many people link this trait to **shamanism in Northern Asia and Siberia**. In some Korean regions shamans were called *Danggol*, similar to *Dangun* (the name of the god-king in the foundation myth). This is often interpreted as a cognate of *Tengri* (deity, god) in many Mongolic and Turkic cultures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Fall of Gojoseon**\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wiman\\_Joseon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wiman_Joseon)\n\nAround 200 BC, Wiman, a general from the Kingdom of Yan of northeastern China, took refuge in Gojoseon in the chaos of the collapse of Qin Dynasty in China. Later, WIman revolted and took over the kingdom.\n\nAbout a hundred years later, China became reunified by Han Dynasty. In 109 BC, the Emperor Wu of Han invaded Wiman Joseon, destroyed it, and established the Four Commanderies of Han.\n\nThis triggered many Gojoseon refugees to migrate to the southern part of the Korean peninsula - **new Koreanic-kingdoms** such as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje arose.\n\n* In particular, the foundation myths of Buyeo (Manchuria), Goguryeo (Manchuria and Northern Korea), and Baekje (Central Korea) are interrelated.\n   * The mythical founder of the **Buyeo** kingdom is Hae Mo-su (the son of heaven)\n   * Jumong, the mythical founder of **Goguryeo**, was the son of Hae Mo-su and a daughter of a river god. Jumong was an exceptional archer, but his half-brothers got jealous of him. With the help of fishes and turtles that created a bridge for him, he escaped Buyeo and established a new kingdom.\n      * [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goguryeo#Jumong\\_and\\_the\\_foundation\\_myth](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goguryeo#Jumong_and_the_foundation_myth)\n      * There's a k-drama called ***Jumong*** that first triggered a global interest in k-drama in the mid-2000s...\n      * Also, Kim Il-sung created similar myths for his cult of personality...\n   * When Jumong left Buyeo, he left his first son there. He had two other sons, Biryu and Onjo, with a new wife named Soseono in his new kingdom. He thought his first son was dead. But when his first son showed up, Jumong immediately made him the crown prince. After this, Jumong's wife Soseono left the kingdom, taking her two sons **southwards** for them to found their own kingdom. This is the origin story of **Baekje**.\n      * [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baekje#Founding](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baekje#Founding)\n\nThere are several hypotheses about who lived in the southern part of the Korean peninsula before this wave. One of the newest and most radical hypotheses I've heard is that Japonic languages had previously been spoken in the southern part of the peninsula, and these were replaced by the advance of Koreanic-speakers from the North ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peninsular\\_Japonic](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peninsular_Japonic)). Although this is a rising hypothesis among linguists, most Koreans haven't yet heard about that (and many will have emotional reactions to it).\n\n* The consensus among linguists so far is that the Koreanic languages and Japonic languages did not originate from the same root. They instead came up with this replacement theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope someone finds this interesting!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1662082902.0},{"title":"'Flesh of the Gods': The Trippy History of Magic Mushrooms - the ancient history of psychotropic fungi.","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/epzx4p\/magic-mushrooms-history","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1662158288.0},{"title":"The ancient Islamic roots of modernity - history of the influence of Islamic design and culture","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/culture\/article\/20220831-how-islamic-art-and-design-conquered-the-world","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1662073707.0},{"title":"The Contradictory Legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev","author":"wewewawa","url":"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/history\/the-contradictory-legacy-of-mikhail-gorbachev-180980679\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1662129165.0},{"title":"Question about penniless kings (Discussion\/Question)","author":"Furno321","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/x39ojs\/question_about_penniless_kings_discussionquestion\/","text":"I always wondered why some kings in High meidieval ages were just too poor to do anything.

For example, Caerleon is said to be his main court in some texts, and he is also associated strongly with Kerniw in early Welsh texts, which would match the region of Cernyw in south east Wales (a large region that may have actually been another name for Gwent).\n\nSo Athrwys lived and ruled in the same place in which Arthur lived and ruled according to much of the earliest information.\n\nAnd regarding when he lived, it\u2019s true that most modern authorities place Athrwys in the seventh century, 100 years after Arthur. But not all scholars agree. Some place him in the sixth century.\n\nHere is some evidence for this: The Life of St Cadoc tells us that Tewdrig, the grandfather of Athrwys, was the great-great-grandfather of Cadoc. It is universally accepted that Cadoc was an early sixth century figure. Since Athrwys was two generations earlier in the family line, then even taking into account long gaps between children in the line from Tewdrig to Athrwys, Athrwys cannot possibly have lived later than the sixth century. Therefore, based on this information, he must have been a contemporary of Arthur.\n\nSo, he lived at the same time as Arthur and ruled the same location as Arthur. Surely, then, he was Arthur? The name \u2018Athrwys\u2019 appears variously as \u2018Arthwys\u2019 and \u2018Arthrwys\u2019, and these could all quite plausibly be corruptions of the Latin form \u2018Arthurus\u2019.\n\nAdditionally, the family of Athrwys matches the legendary family of Arthur is various ways: \n\n- Arthur\u2019s sister Anna (*HRB*) matches Athrwys\u2019 sister Anna.\n\n- Arthur\u2019s maternal uncle Gwrfoddw Hen (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) matches Athrwys\u2019 likely maternal uncle Gwrfoddw, king of Ergyng. \n\n- Arthur\u2019s sons Morgan and Adeluf (*Le Petit Bruit*) match Athrwys\u2019 sons Morgan and Ithel. \n\n- Arthur\u2019s brother Madoc (*Dialogue of Arthur and Eryr*) matches Athrwys\u2019 likely brother Madoc Morfryn.\n\n- Arthur\u2019s son Gwydr (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) may well match Gwrhitir, the possible son of Athrwys (he was either the son of Athrwys or the son of Morgan ap Athrwys).\n\n- Arthur\u2019s relative (possibly his maternal uncle) Iaen (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) likely matches Athrwys\u2019 maternal uncle Ieuan. \n\n- Arthur\u2019s father Uther Pendragon (*HRB*) matches Tewdrig, the grandfather of Athrwys, whose career matches Uther Pendragon in many key ways. And like Uther, he died when Athrwys was young. \n\n- Arthur\u2019s cousin, an unnamed Irish king (*Life of St Padarn* if I\u2019m not mistaken) matches King Brychan, the Irish cousin of Athrwys. \n\nThe family of Athrwys is also known to have intermarried with the royal family of King Budic over in Brittany, which is the same dynasty that Arthur\u2019s family intermarries with in the legends.\n\nEdit: Most of these familial connections can be found in *King Arthur: The Man Who Conquered Europe*, by Caleb Howells.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1661955236.0},{"title":"Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union\u2019s final leader, dies","author":"MeatballDom","url":"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/08\/30\/mikhail-gorbachev-soviet-union-cold-war-obit-035311","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1661895953.0},{"title":"What Was Life Really Like In A Victorian Workhouse? | Secrets From The Workhouse | Absolute History","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1MX_fSw8etY","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1661971970.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/x2am3n\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

One Common Characteristic","author":"Gigitoe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/wybzhu\/what_makes_a_mountain_historically_sacred_one\/","text":"To the Ancient Greeks, [Mt. Olympus](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/17\/Mytikas.jpg) was the home of the gods, the birthplace of legends. For all they knew, Mt. Olympus could very well have been the tallest mountain in the world, as there weren't any mountains nearby that were nearly as high. Nowadays, we know that Mt. Olympus, with an elevation of 2917\u00a0m, is less than one-third the height of the tallest mountain on Earth\u2014Mt. Everest\u2014which has an elevation of 8849 m. Perhaps if the Ancient Greeks had seen the Alps or Himalayas, they would have thought differently.\n\nThroughout history, numerous mountains around the world have been regarded as sacred by local populations. In biblical allusions, [Mt. Ararat](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/75\/Mount_Ararat_and_the_Yerevan_skyline_in_spring_%2850mm%29.jpg\/1920px-Mount_Ararat_and_the_Yerevan_skyline_in_spring_%2850mm%29.jpg) (elev: 5137\u00a0m) is held to be the landing site of Noah's Ark. To the Ancient Chinese, [Huangshan](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1d\/Huangshan_pic_4.jpg) (elev: 1864 m) is seen as the place where the Yellow Emperor created the Pills of Immortality. In the San Francisco Bay Area, [Mt. Diablo](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/62\/View_of_Mount_Diablo_and_CA_Highway_24_from_Lafayette_Heights.jpg) is regarded by the Miwok and Ohlone Tribes as the creation point of the world, despite its relatively low elevation of 1173 m.\n\nNone of these mountains are even remotely close to being the tallest in the world. Yet, they all have one thing in common: they are ***dominant points***. The definition of a dominant point is quite simple:\n\nImagine you're standing at the summit (the highest point) of Mt. Olympus. Let the *horizon* at the summit refer to the flat plane that intersects the summit, to which the direction of gravity at the summit is perpendicular to. In other words, the horizon represents your flat eye-level when you're standing at the summit. Something is *above the horizon* of the summit if it's on the side of this plane that is opposite of the direction of gravity. In other words, when you're standing at the summit, you'll have to look above your flat eye-level to see a point that is above your horizon.\n\nA point on Earth's surface is a ***dominant point*** if nothing on the planet rises above the horizon of that point. Standing at a dominant point, nothing rises above your horizon. You are *on top of the world*.\n\nFor instance, Mt. Olympus is a dominant point because nothing rises above your horizon when you're standing at its summit. Sure, [Mt. Etna](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/39\/Mt_Etna_and_Catania1.jpg) in Italy may have a higher elevation of 3357 m, but Mt. Etna is so far away from Mt. Olympus that due to Earth's curvature, the summit of Mt. Etna is approximately 30 km *below* the horizon of Mt. Olympus. (Sorry, flat-Earthers!)\n\nMeanwhile, [Twin Peaks](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/11\/Twin_Peaks-San_Francisco.jpg) (elev: 282 m) in San Francisco is not a dominant point because there are higher mountains nearby that rise above the horizon of its summit, including Mt. Diablo, which rises over 700 m above its horizon. As expected, Twin Peaks does not have the same sacred status as Mt. Diablo, which is a dominant point.\n\nWhy are so many sacred mountains dominant points? It turns out that back in the day, when knowledge of distant lands was limited, a local mountaintop that feels like the top of the world may as well be thought of as the tallest mountain in the world, lending it divine significance.\n\nThat's not to say that all sacred mountains are dominant. Many non-dominant mountains are held sacred for their unique shape or other subjective factors, as is the case for [Mt. Kailash](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/e3\/Kailash_north.JPG\/1920px-Kailash_north.JPG) (elev: 6714 m) in Tibet or [Uluru](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Uluru_%28Helicopter_view%29-crop.jpg) (elev: 863 m) in Australia. But ultimately, a dominant mountain has a much greater likelihood of being sacred, and a sacred mountain has a remarkable chance of being dominant.\n\nPerhaps to our ancestors, being on top of the world, after all, was the closest that one can get to the heavens.\n\n---\n\nFor a more technical explanation of dominant points, check out this [research paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2208.01600).","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1661527376.0},{"title":"Thousands of medieval images available for free, thanks to Albertina Museum","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/www.medievalists.net\/2022\/08\/medieval-images-albertina-museum\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1661410980.0},{"title":"I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t learn about this in school.","author":"lostintime000","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/x-ItsPBTFO0","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.48,"created_utc":1661610218.0},{"title":"First Female Viking Grave Discovered In Swedish Mountains","author":"gottaherd","url":"https:\/\/arkeonews.net\/first-female-viking-grave-discovered-in-swedish-mountains\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1661356036.0},{"title":"The complex of Bilge Kagan and Kultigin's father, \u0130lteri\u015f Kagan, was found in Mongolia","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/nowarchaeology.com\/the-complex-of-bilge-kagan-and-kultigins-father-ilteris-kagan-was-found-in-mongolia\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1661416586.0},{"title":"Decoratively coloured walls are helping archaeologists paint a picture of this 2,000-year-old Roman temple","author":"MeatballDom","url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/style\/article\/italy-cupra-temple-interior-discovery-scn\/index.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1661396052.0},{"title":"The \u2018lost\u2019 islands of Cardigan Bay, Wales, UK: insights into the post-glacial evolution of some Celtic coasts of northwest Europe","author":"ArtOak","url":"https:\/\/journals.lib.unb.ca\/index.php\/ag\/article\/view\/32596","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1661323268.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/wwghxq\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

But unlike cragside the mansion house i am investigating does not have a hydropower setup\n\nThere was however a private water supply fed to the house from a large circular water tank on side of hill (another half mile away from that engine building) so there is a possibility that may have been used to power the generator\/engine but as to how that could have been done is unknown.

War was finally over, and with the unification of China, peace and prosperity would finally come\u2026 Unfortunately, Qin Shi Huang (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687), the first emperor of China died after only 11 years of rule (some sources say he died of unknowingly self-inflicted mercury poisoning, other sources say he was assassinated). With the death of Qin Shi Huang, the centralized government that kept the empire together, shattered. Nobles forged letters that they claimed had been written by the emperor before his death, telling the heir of the throne to commit suicide, puppet emperors were installed and replaced many times by other puppet emperors; TLDR, China was a total mess, again\u2026\n\n**Rise of the rebels:** The nobles were fighting to fill the power vacuum that Qin Shi Huang\u2019s death left, and so nobody was paying attention when two peasants Chen Sheng (\u9648\u80dc) and Wu Guang (\u5434\u5e7f) rose up in the province of Henan (\u6cb3\u5357), starting the Dazexiang (\u5927\u6cfd\u4e61) rebellion. The Qin dynasty rule was based on harsh punishments and fear by the peasant population, but the enforcement needed the might of an army, but the Qin government lacked an army led by a powerful leader. The ensuing chaos caused multiple other rebellions to spring up all around the country.  One of those rebelling peasants was Liu Bang (\u5218\u90a6), a peasant who had simply gone with the flow of events and decided to join the revolt. Joining an army of peasants, Liu Bang quickly rose up the ranks, even allegedly becoming friends and \"brothers\"\\* with Xiang Yu (\u9879\u7fbd), a powerful noble from the state of Chu who was a prominent candidate to become the next emperor of China. As time passed, the imperial court finally started calming down, and a eunuch named Zhao Gao (\u8d75\u9ad8) successfully took control (according to some sources, he was the one who had Qin Shi Huang assassinated). He \"inherited\" an empire in flames (congrats\u2026). As the Qin government's internal issues were finally \u201csolved\u201d (not really), they sent army after army trying to quash the rebellion.\n\n**War against the Qin:** The rebel forces under king Huai of Chu (\u695a\u6000\u738b), realizing that they wouldn\u2019t last fighting against the Qin dynasty armies, decided that the rebellion had to strike at the heart of the empire and take the capital of the Qin dynasty, Xianyang (\u54b8\u9633). To incentivize his people, king Huai informed his followers, that whoever took the capital first would become the king of the region of Guanzhong (\u5173\u4e2d). This caused a rivalry between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu.  Because Xiang Yu was bogged down by the army of Qin (which was significantly larger than his, but he still won, defying all odds), Liu Bang reached and took the capital first (at that point, one of Zhao Gao\u2019s puppet emperors killed Zhao Gao and surrendered to Liu Bang). Xiang Yu was furious; he buried all the 200,000\\*\\* soldiers of the Qin dynasty that had surrendered to him alive and marched towards Xianyang. Xiang Yu had 400,000 troops while Liu Bang only had 100,000 troops, Liu Bang was going to be decimated, unless\u2026 When Xiang Yu entered the city of Xianyang, Liu Bang allegedly groveled before him and convinced Xiang Yu that he was loyal and not a threat, narrowly avoiding death in the \u201cFeast at Swan Goose Gate (\u9e3f\u95e8\u5bb4)\u201d.\n\n**The fall of Xiang Yu\u2019s empire:** Having gained power after multiple victories vs the Qin, Xiang Yu became more and more powerful, slowly making King Huai (the figurehead of the rebellion) his puppet, essentially becoming emperor in everything but name. After successfully defeating the Qin government, the empire was divided into eighteen parts. One of the less attractive regions (nowadays Sichuan, \u56db\u5ddd) was given to Liu Bang who slowly regained his strength. One of the reasons why the empire that Xiang Yu created failed, was that many of the dukes controlling the different regions were unhappy with the amount of territory they were given, as Xiang Yu was unwilling to give much power to them.  This led to the same type of situation as during the Qin dynasty: The nobility wanting more power from the centralized government, fighting and plotting to destroy the regime and become king themselves. Finally, the death of King Huai in 206 BCE, whether assassinated by Xiang Yu or not, caused the feudal lords who accused Xiang Yu of murder to rebel. This group of rebelling states led by Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu, using sheer numbers and good generals (though it took many tries, as Liu Bang lost fight after fight against Xiang Yu), finally installing Liu Bang as emperor, who astutely was more willing to share his power in order to reign over China, changing Chinese history forever.  Fun fact: Chinese Chess (\u8c61\u68cb), a game played by millions in China, depicts one part of this war, where Xiang Yu and Liu Bang make peace, deciding to split the empire in half. Of course, Liu Bang broke the peace immediately and attacked Xiang Yu while he wasn\u2019t ready, leading to his eventual defeat (though Xiang Yu made many heroic stands).\n\n**The first large-scale peasant revolts and why they happened:** Before the Qin dynasty, unlike the later widespread dissent from the nobility and the peasants, there were few large-scale peasant uprisings in China, with changes in dynasties rather being caused by feuds between different tribes and their nobility. Once we reach the Qin dynasty though, large-scale peasant rebellions occurred, becoming a frequent issue in the collapse of most future Chinese dynasties. From my point of view (tell me if I\u2019m wrong), two of the main reasons why there were so many peasant revolts in the Qin dynasty (and afterwards) are urbanization (high population concentration), and economic instability for the peasantry, caused by high taxation on top of land issues (talked about more in part 3). Though China only started seriously urbanizing in the 21st century, there is a noticeable difference in the levels of urbanization between the start and the end of the Zhou dynasty. This is because of the advancements in trade, causing the start of the early silk road, and improving inland trade using the rivers of China around 600 BCE. Furthermore, these advances in trade and the growth of the population caused increasing urbanization (as people didn\u2019t have to be on farmland, secluded, instead making a living off creating other products and selling them). Due to urbanization, people were more likely to rebel as they could share dissent with so many of their comrades and watched others suffer and die. Indeed, as communication became easier, not only were large-scale revolts easier to be sparked, but they also gained traction faster, which could sometimes make the difference between a small revolt that was crushed in its tracks, and a revolt that destroyed a nation.\n\n# Part 2: The rise of Confucianism, and changes in governance\n\n**Introduction:** After defeating Xiang Yu at the battle of Gaixia (\u5793\u4e0b), forming the Han dynasty, Liu Bang and his descendants would try to stabilize the empire, dealing with the threats inside.\n\n**The resurgence of feudalism:** With the establishment of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang had to fulfill all the promises he made to his loyal generals and advisors. He also had to manage power dynamics of the different nobles, to keep them from revolting and causing Liu Bang to suffer the same fate as Xiang Yu. As he had promised, Liu Bang reestablished the feudal system of the Zhou Dynasty, giving the land to his loyal followers (one common misconception from my understanding, is that Liu Bang feoffed the land to the Liu family members, whom he could trust. In fact, these supposed \u201crelatives\u201d only gained the Liu title after taking control of a state as to have the legitimacy to govern a state). Liu Bang kept around 50% of the Chinese lands that he had not given out, and instead implemented the Qin dynasty's system: The \u201cPrefectures and Counties system (\u90e1\u53bf\u5236)\u201d. Essentially this system divided the empire into certain provinces, and those provinces would be governed by governors sent out by the imperial court (the higher positions were chosen by the emperor, the lower ones were chosen by other officials). Unfortunately, the feudal system of the Zhou dynasty had many issues, as the level of autonomy of the feudal states was very high, each one even having its own laws and army, leading to many issues later on in the empire.\n\n**Tug of war between the feudal lords and the emperors:** For the next few centuries of Han rule, because of the power of the nobility and the decentralization of the government, Han rulers tried to take back more power while the nobility tried to gain more autonomy. This led to many wars and feuds between the nobility and the emperors. One famous example of such a revolt was in 154 BCE, where Emperor Jing (\u6c49\u666f\u5e1d) divided the provinces into smaller chunks as to minimize the power of the nobility. This led to 7 out of the 12 feudal lords rebelling against the emperor, fighting ferociously yet still losing in only 3 months in the \u201cRebellion of the Seven States (\u4e03\u56fd\u4e4b\u4e71)\u201d, causing China to stay united. This event slowly lead to the \u201cvictory\u201d by the emperors of the Han dynasty over the nobility and the gradual decline of a feudal system in favor of the \u201cPrefectures and Counties (\u90e1\u53bf\u5236)\u201d system of the Qin dynasty, with all provinces being converted to the latter system by 100 BCE. With \u201ctotal\u201d power and a centralized government, emperors like Han Wudi (\u6c49\u6b66\u5e1d) and Han Xuandi (\u6c49\u5ba3\u5e1d) finally brought a golden age in Chinese history, establishing the silk road and expanding the empire (I will talk about the silk road in detail in part 4) .\n\n**Stabilizing the Empire\/The rise of Confucianism:** While Confucianism (\u5112\u5bb6) emerged in the Spring and Autumn period (\u6625\u79cb\u65f6\u671f), Confucianism only rose to prominence in the Han dynasty (before that Confucius was popular with the populace but not with the nobility). In fact, during the lifetime of Confucius, he had little to no success in government circles, becoming a fugitive over and over, having to escape many civil wars. In an environment where warfare ability was of paramount importance, the ideas of Confucius had very little noticeable effect and struggled to find traction. So the question is what changed during the Han dynasty that made Confucianism popular and even the \"state religion\" of the Han dynasty? Emperor Liu Bang\u2019s humble origins made him lack a certain authority. According to the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies: \u201cThe prevailing conception of the ruler of \u201call-under-Heaven\" at the time was that he must be a man of noble origin, or a man ordained by Heaven, or a man of great wisdom and virtue. Liu Bang was not of noble birth, nor was he, to quote his own words, \"a man of wisdom and virtue.\u201d \u201d Therefore, to solve the issue of legitimacy, Liu Bang went to great lengths to make the populace believe that he was indeed \u201cordained by heaven\u201d, and that is when he and his descendants turned to Confucianism. It is important to note though, that the version of \u201cConfucianism\u201d that came about in the Han dynasty was slightly different than the ideals that Confucius had a few centuries earlier, as Confucianism had slightly changed over time with different advocates adding ideas from Taoism, legalism, and the five elements (a philosophical system of the \u201cWarring States \u6218\u56fd\u65f6\u671f\u201d period).\n\n# Part 3: The economy of the Han dynasty\n\nThis topic is way too complex and nuanced to summarize, as it is not static in the 400 years of Han rule and changed over time, so these are from my understanding some basic points:\n\n1. Population growth in the Han dynasty: The rapid rise of the population (the population reached over 60 million in the Han dynasty) because of the development of agricultural technology was a two-sided blade, as it caused many administrative issues and made the country harder to govern. Many people also starved as the food production was not catching up with the country's needs. In the Zhou dynasty, land was a lot easier to come by, as the Zhou dynasty was expanding rapidly into neighboring tribes faster than the population could grow. The situation was kind of the same as in America, where you could go to an empty patch of land and simply claim it, with no one caring. Once we reach the Han dynasty though, this changes, with the demand for land becoming higher, while the supply stayed relatively the same.\n2. Land control in the Han dynasty: As I mentioned in my previous post about the Qin dynasty, during the Warring States period, due to the reforms of Shang Yang, land could be bought and sold freely. This resulted in generations of wealthy landowners growing their land base over hundreds of years, acquiring lands from small landowners that had fallen into debt. According to Chan Cuo, an official of the Han dynasty, the average landowning family of 5 people was at high risk of falling into debt in the circumstance of natural disasters or due to high taxation. Many emperors like emperor Ai (\u6c49\u54c0\u5e1d) attempted to limit the amount of land the nobility could amass, but failed as emperors (especially in the Eastern Han dynasty) relied heavily on the wealthy aristocracy to secure their position as emperor. The issue with this concentration of land under a few landowning families was that it caused even more power to accumulate in the hands of a few individuals, and it caused peasants to be even poorer.\n3. Tax Reforms: To try and stop the main tax base of the peasant landowners from falling into debt and handing over their land to the nobility, and to simply help the peasant population survive, the Han dynasty continuously lowered taxes in times of instability (i.e. natural disasters). Sometimes, the land\/agricultural tax was even suspended. Therefore, during periods of increased capital needs (e.g. in the case of a war), the Han dynasty would have to raise taxes on the merchants and the nobility (e.g. increasing property and poll tax, or nationalizing a certain industry). During the reign of Han Wudi, when he needed to fill the national treasury to wage his wars, he sold titles, which became a trend especially in the Eastern Han dynasty, making the government increasingly corrupt and out of talent.\n\n# Part 4: Han golden age\/The silk road\n\n**Introduction:** As the Han dynasty gradually centralized its power, the emperors could finally dare to start making radical changes with a more manageable risk of being overthrown. Han Wudi (\u6c49\u6b66\u5e1d) was the first of these \u201cpowerful\u201d emperors. He would go on to make Confucianism the state religion, and create the backbone for the imperial service exam (\u79d1\u4e3e).\n\n**The Han dual religious system:** Though most associate the Han dynasty with Confucianism, and though Han Wudi would make Confucianism the state religion, he would create more of a hybrid legalist-Confucian doctrine. This is shown by his legalist policies and advisors (the whole idea of a centralized government is legalist). Han Wudi even created schools funded by the government to teach the Confucian precepts. This system of a mix of legalist and Confucian ideals would lead to the China we know today and the cultural ideas of the Chinese people (also influencing other Asian nations).\n\n**Taking the south:** While the southern tribes of Minyue (\u95fd\u8d8a) and Nanyue (\u5357\u8d8a) fought each other, Han Wudi decided to invade, retaking land lost in the collapse of the Qin dynasty and gaining a lot of nowadays Chinese land. In order to assimilate the southern tribes and keep them from rebelling, Han Wudi used deportation, lowering the concentration of non-Chinese peoples in the south. This and many climate-related issues kept the south of China relatively undeveloped until later dynasties in which the northern nomads invaded, making the Chinese peoples migrate to the south. This flourishing of the south in the Song dynasty led to the peak of the maritime silk road and the prospering of trade in general.\n\n**Zhang Qian (\u5f20\u9a9e), and the silk road**: A constant thorn in the side of all Chinese dynasties, the northern nomads of the steppes (at this time the Xiongnu (\u5308\u5974)) continually raided and demanded tribute from the Han dynasty). As the Han dynasty became stronger, Han Wudi decided to stop the policy of tribute and placation, attacking the nomads in war after war (over a few hundred years, the Han dynasty would finally defeat them, forcing them to migrate to Eastern Europe, becoming the Huns). To do so, Han Wudi needed allies in the west. As a diplomat for the Han dynasty, Zhang Qian was tasked with initiating diplomatic talks between the Han dynasty and the people in Central Asia, helping to build trade routes and forming an alliance with the Yuezhi peoples (who were displaced by the Xiongnu hundreds of years ago), to fight the Xiongnu empire. On his trek to central Asia, Zhang Qian was captured by the Xiongnu, staying in their lands as a prisoner for ten years. Even so, Zhang Qian still remembered his task and escaped when his Xiongnu captors put down their guard. After a long journey, Zhang Qian finally made his way to the sophisticated nations of central Asia. Though he didn\u2019t succeed in creating an alliance with the Yuezhi, he saw the Hellenised city-states of Bactria and Ferghana, and he finally came back to China after 13 years (being captured AGAIN by the Xiongnu on the way back) with valuable information about the Xiongnu and the nations in Central Asia.\n\n**War for the heavenly horses:** After defeating the Xiongnu in a war, Han Wudi would decide to send his armies west, through the Taklamakan desert to attack Ferghana for her heavenly horses. This war is the infamous Greco-Chinese war. More than half the army died from thirst, but after two tries and more than 100,000 Chinese deaths, Han Wudi successfully defeated Ferghana, taking their horses and in the process also taking control of the group of tribes inside of the Tarim basin. Stability from outposts in the Tarim basin would further lead to the creation of the silk road (and you guessed it, the trade of more horses!).\n\n**Issues with war:** In order to gain funds for the war, Han Wudi didn\u2019t want to increase the taxation on the peasantry. Therefore, he had to monopolize the highly profitable iron, minting of coins, and salt industries. Finally, his government would start a trend of selling titles and offices, in order to gain money. This would cause significant problems in the future as only the wealthy, not the talented would get positions. As glorious as some modern games and historians make war seem, war in real life is of course quite gruesome (I know it's obvious, but I think it's worth pointing out). The issue with any ruler who waged continuous war, like Justinian the great of the Byzantine empire, or in this example Han Wudi, is that they use up a nation's resources. So many people died to gain some \u201cheavenly horses\u201d. Therefore, there is a huge disconnect between which rulers were liked by peasants at the time of their rule and nowadays people. Though nowadays we regard Han Wudi\u2019s reign as a golden age in Chinese history, he was not actually very popular with his people, and was seen as outright tyrannical by many.\n\n# Part 5: The downfall of the Western Han dynasty, and the rise of the Xin dynasty\n\n**Introduction:** After the territorial expansion of Han Wudi, and the peak of the Han dynasty under Han Xuandi (\u6c49\u5ba3\u5e1d), the empire started buckling under growing corruption. Issues start popping up inside of the empire, with certain clans gaining more and more power. This eventually led to the fall of the Western Han dynasty and the rise of the \u201csocialist\u201d Xin dynasty.\n\n**The rise of the Wang clan:** An issue during the Western Han dynasty that caused instability and the decentralization of power, was the growing power of certain consort-clans i.e. the emperor\u2019s maternal relatives (this would become even more problematic later in the Eastern Han dynasty). One example of this was the L\u00fc clan, specifically, empress dowager L\u00fc, who essentially acted as the regent and puppeteer of the Han dynasty\u2019s emperors at the early period of the Han dynasty\\*\\*\\*. If the L\u00fc clan had continued gaining power, they might have overthrown the Han dynasty at its weak and early state. Unfortunately for the L\u00fc clan, empress dowager L\u00fc died, leading to the downfall of the L\u00fc clan (most of empress dowager L\u00fc\u2019s relatives were either killed or removed from the court during the L\u00fc clan disturbance). This type of situation happened frequently as the consort-clans were close to the royal family, meaning they would gain more and more power. Because of young emperors and a childless emperor (which helped these consort clans gain more power as they would be put in the position to influence who would become emperor), the Wang (\u738b) clan became more powerful in the imperial court during the late Western Han dynasty (around the turn of the millennium 0 CE).\n\n**The meteoric rise of Wang Mang (\u738b\u83bd) the humble:** One of the members of the Wang clan was Wang Mang. Unlike his cousins though, because Wang Mang\u2019s father and brother died early on, his family never succeeded in getting high positions in the government (which would have been easier for them due to nepotism in order to fill the court with loyal people). Later in his life, since he was related to the empress, and due to his humble and helpful nature (for example, it\u2019s claimed that when his powerful uncle was sick, he stayed day and night caring for him\u2026), he climbed up the social ladder. Unfortunately, in 5 BCE, he made a mistake by opposing empress dowager Fu, being exiled to Xindu (nowadays Henan). In his exile, Wang Mang kept a low profile (in order to stop accusations of plotting), waiting for the right moment to stage a comeback. An opportunity came in 2 BCE, where because of the death of empress dowager Fu as well as multiple petitions for the return of Wang Mang, emperor Ai (\u6c49\u54c0\u5e1d) summoned him back to the capital. In 1 BCE, emperor Ai then died and empress dowager Wang seized power, making Wang Mang the regent.  Wang Mang now with absolute power purged the court of all his enemies. In order to increase his power in preparation to usurp the Han dynasty, Wang Mang continued building his personality cult, with many people submitting \u201cprophecies\u201d in the following years comparing him to other legendary figures. Once we reach 5 CE, the thirteen-year-old emperor became unhappy with Wang Mang, as it was clear to him now that Wang Mang had killed and exiled all his family. In order to stop this threat, Wang Mang poisoned Emperor Ping, installing a one-year-old emperor. After finally defeating all his enemies, Wang Mang took the throne, using the legitimacy due to his cult of personality and the resulting prophecies to become emperor. Usurping and destroying the 200-year-long Western Han dynasty, Wang Mang formed the Xin (\u65b0) dynasty in 9 CE. (what a ride, hope you stuck through it!).\n\n**The reign of Wang Mang:** Trying to understand the mess that was Wang Mang is as confusing as trying to understand Caligula. Wang Mang worked so hard over the years to finally defeat the Han dynasty, forming his own dynasty. And then, he just gives it up\u2026 He suddenly starts making so many weird decisions like creating \u201cnew\u201d coins and renaming cities, trying to take land from the nobility and give it back to the peasantry. Why? It seems that a part of the explanation is that Wang Mang was a fanatical Confucian. One of the beliefs of Confucius is that he believed that the ways of the early Zhou dynasty were the right ones. Therefore, Wang Mang spent all his time as emperor reading book after book about the Zhou dynasty, trying to understand their legal system, and implement it, essentially reversing the times to 1000 years ago. The issue was, there wasn\u2019t a lot of information about the early Zhou dynasty, and a lot of the ideas of that time were outdated, made for a smaller kingdom.\n\n**The meteoric fall of Wang Mang:** Because of all these illogical\/strange reforms, everyone turned against Wang Mang. The peasants didn\u2019t like him because the yellow river floods during his reign, causing one of the worst famines in Chinese history. The merchants didn\u2019t like him as he made trading very difficult as the new currencies (yes, there were many) were impractical, many going into the black market simply to use \"normal\" coinage. The nobility\/landowners didn\u2019t like him as he was trying to take away all their lands and return to the system in the Zhou dynasty. Once it became clear that everyone hated Wang Mang\u2019s new Xin dynasty, the remnants of the Liu family recruited armies and rebelled.\n\n**Infighting between the rebels, and the rise of Liu Xiu (\u5218\u79c0):** The two major peasant rebellion movements at the time were the \u201cRed Eyebrows (\u8d64\u7709)\u201d, from the Shandong (\u5c71\u4e1c) and Jiangxi (\u6c5f\u897f) regions, and the Green Forests (\u7eff\u6797), led by Liu Xuan (\u5218\u7384), from the Henan (\u6cb3\u5357) and Hubei (\u6e56\u5317) regions. The army of Liu Xuan defeated Wang Mang\u2019s army, retaking the capital and creating the Eastern Han dynasty\u2026 Except, that was of course not how the story ended, though since Liu Xuan successfully became emperor, but had to deal with many issues. First of all, he had to handle the opposition of the Liu family, killing Liu Yan (\u5218\u6f14), but sparing his brother Liu Xiu (\u5218\u79c0), who had before his execution become a prominent general, helping to defeat Wang Mang. Liu Xiu, secretly angry about the death of his brother, started planning a coup. Then, in the year 24 CE, the red eyebrows decided to attack Liu Xuan, destroying his regime. The problem was that though the red eyebrows were good at warfare and had a powerful military, they made many administrative \"mistakes\" (like robbing the people\u2026). Losing the support of the population around the capital and the Guanzhong (\u5173\u4e2d) region. The red eyebrows ran out of food and supplies. Liu Xiu, who had stayed neutral in the war between Liu Xuan and the red eyebrows saw his opportunity, and defeated the weakened red eyebrows, forming the Eastern Han dynasty, and crowning himself Guangwu Di (\u5149\u6b66\u5e1d).\n\n# Part 6: The Eastern Han dynasty: Young Emperors, power struggles, and yellow turban rebellions\n\n**Introduction:** With the collapse of the Xin dynasty, a golden age of Chinese history would start, lasting for a whole three emperors before crashing down and burning in the mess of court politics (let's go\u2026).\n\n**The era of prosperity during the Eastern Han dynasty:** After the reign of Guangwu Di from 25 to 57 CE, in which the empire was stabilized and expanded, came the \u201cThe rule of Ming and Zhang (\u660e\u7ae0\u4e4b\u6cbb)\u201d. In the reign of these two emperors, the people could finally recuperate (\u4fee\u517b\u8eab\u606f), with water reserves being built, and farming encouraged. It was at this time that paper was invented, helping the distribution of Chinese texts and making education more accessible and cheaper. Furthermore, there was improvement up to \"perfection\" of many other crafts like that of porcelain creation. Finally, the government was centralized, the Huns were pacified, and Buddhism reached China through the silk road, fighting with Confucianism for the heart of the peoples. This battle of the philosophies\/religions would slowly cause the mixing of Buddhism and Confucianism over a millennium to form Neo-Confucianism.\n\n**The slow crumbling of the Liu family's power:** After the first 3 emperors, problems started emerging, as the emperor and his family started losing power to other factions, including the eunuchs, and the nobility\/warlords. This was because the child emperors that were puppets of the empress dowagers needed the support of others like the nobility or the eunuchs to retake power from their regents. An example of this is in the reign of Han Huandi (\u6c49\u6853\u5e1d), where things started changing in favor of the eunuchs. This is because in order to regain power from the Liang families clutches, Han Huandi used the help of the eunuchs, heavily rewarding them for helping him. The eunuchs were openly corrupt, and for the first time, with the emperor's approval, as emperor Huan himself was also corrupt, executing anyone who criticized his rule. To illustrate the amount of power the eunuchs had, here is a song lyric describing them: \\*\"Zuo can reverse heaven's decision. Ju sits by himself without a match. Xu is a lying wolf. Tang's power is as prevalent as the falling rain.\u201d\\*According to the Journal of Asian history, this increase in power of people outside the imperial family gradually led to a disregard for imperial authority, shown by the increased amount of forged letters and assassinations in the later Eastern Han dynasty. Indeed, according to the Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient: \u201cprivate and local power came to replace public authority\u201d. The nobility no longer saw the emperors as \"divine\" and therefore did as they wished, with many increasing their wealth with corruption.\n\n**Administrative issues inside the empire:** In 86 CE, because of the cultural differences between the Han governors and the natives, the sheer size of the empire (making reacting to rebellions slower), and simply bad governors because of corruption, the Qiang peoples of nowadays Xibei (\u897f\u5317)  rebelled. The Qiang peoples and other peoples in southern China would rebel multiple times afterwards and would become a constant nuisance for the Eastern Han dynasty. This on top of the corruption of the eunuchs and emperors who sold titles and dried out all imperial talent, made the situation even direr.\n\n**The yellow turban rebellion:** Finally, because of multiple earthquakes, famines, plagues, and many other natural disasters in China, the people became increasingly desperate. Then, just as everyone was giving up hope, someone named Zhang Jue\/Jiao (\u5f20\u89d2) presented himself as the solution to everyone's problems. He claimed that he could cure people using magical Taoist powers. He also claimed that the Han dynasty had lost the mandate of heaven, and so had to be overthrown. This led to the infamous yellow turban rebellion, which lasted from 184 CE to 205 CE (most of the rebellion was crushed a few years after they revolted, but some remnants survived for quite long). Though the rebellion itself didn\u2019t cause the fall of the Han dynasty, it contributed to the strengthening of the warlords, as the emperor needed their help to defeat the yellow turbans. In the year 189 CE, the emperor suddenly died, and so with the power to do so, He Jin (\u6cb3\u6d25), the brother of the empress dowager and \u201cleader\u201d of the warlord's faction decided to kill all the eunuchs (factionalism was also a factor in the eventual clash between the eunuchs and warlords). To do so, he asked for the help of different warlords around the country and attacked the eunuchs successfully killing them (He Jin died in the fight because of a plot by the eunuchs). Though the warlords won, they were exhausted. And so, when Dong Zhuo (\u8463\u5353), a tyrant warlord from the far north arrived, he would find the capital in flames, and the two sons of the emperor, killing one and taking the other hostage, making the young emperor his puppet. Thus, the three kingdoms period would begin\u2026 (to be continued, and talked about more in detail in a future post).\n\n**End notes:** As will be evident, I\u2019m not an expert on the Han dynasty, I\u2019m just a teenage history nerd who wants to sort out his own understanding of the Han dynasty and start a discussion with people on this fascinating topic. As most of the things in this article I learnt from the internet, my understanding of this time period is quite sporadic and all over the place, so iv'e tried to eliminate that in this article, but some places might still be too detailed and some with not enough detail, so please tell me if there is any hole in my narrative! I hope the notes I took are somehow of value for others, and if there are any mistakes in the post or you have any other feedback, let me know! Have I missed anything important that happened in the Han dynasty? What other part of Chinese history do you find fascinating? What is your opinion of Xiang Yu? Was he a great warrior who valiantly fought off the scoundrel Liu Bang, or was he an arrogant prick who underestimated his enemies?\n\n\\* By brothers I don\u2019t mean literal brothers, but ceremonial brothers. At this time period, making someone your \u201cbrother\u201d seemed to be the normal way to form a political \u201calliance\u201d or bond with someone else.\n\n\\*\\* We have to keep in mind that the most reliable source we have for periods before the Han dynasty are books written in the Han dynasty, like Sima Qian\u2019s \u201cThe Records of History (\u53f2\u8bb0)\u201d. The issue with these books is that well\u2026 they are written in the Han dynasty, and commissioned by the Han government, so are probably (one hundred percent) biased about the Qin dynasty and the formation of the Han dynasty\u2026 Another thing is that troop numbers were commonly bolstered in texts, so they might be inaccurate\u2026 Ahhhhhh, what we (amateur) historians love, a scrambled mess of stories\/myths, and facts!\n\n\\*\\*\\* Historians don't consider the puppet \u201cemperors\u201d of Empress dowager L\u00fc as legitimate emperors.\n\nEdit: If you have read all the way to the end, it's been a long journey, and I hope this article somehow helped you! I find it fascinating how many people are willing to spend their day reading such a long article and even commenting, and I thank everyone for any feedback that they gave (currently, I don't have time to respond to the comments, and so I will respond in a few hours)!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1658297478.0},{"title":"Ctesias and the True Date of the Trojan War","author":"Particular-Second-84","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/w3oygh\/ctesias_and_the_true_date_of_the_trojan_war\/","text":"The Trojan War is normally dated to about 1200 BCE, give or take a few decades, placing it right at the end of the Bronze Age.

If they become large enough, the economy would be able to sustain trades like blacksmiths, etc. Plus churches, etc. \n\nGood so far?\n\nBut here's the thing--from my experience and knowledge, farmers (whether they're landowning gentlemen-farmers or tenant-farmers\/sharecroppers) normally live *in* the farm. Among the fields. And given that farms are large plots of land, wouldn't that mean that peasant domiciles are actually very far apart, physically?\n\nI assume I'm missing something and overthinking it? :)\n\nEdit: I am aware that for manors, the village itself may be created and developed directly by the lord, and thus artificially force all their crofters and serfs to live in an centralized area and they'd have to commute outside the village proper to their fields. \n\nBut there are also grassroots villages that just spring up organically. Those are the ones I really wonder about.\n\nEdit 2: I am actually from SE Asia, and am basing my observations on rural farmlands here. Tenant farmers here usually live in small huts located within their farmland itself. And it's a bit of a walk to get to town. So that's why I was wondering how those towns organically came to be in the first place. \n\nEdit 3: So the consensus is that for the most part, peasant fields weren't that big, and peasants didn't live within the farmland, but instead commuted to work (even if it's just a 10 min walk).\n\nThanks, all!","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1658279499.0},{"title":"Were medieval castle earthworks overgrown?","author":"HelenRaeRants","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/w2mv9i\/were_medieval_castle_earthworks_overgrown\/","text":"For decades it's been the norm to present heritage sites including castles in a very formal, tidy, close-mowed style - but was this done in the past?

Let me also carefully clarify that this does not mean that previous eras were not studied or admired, but specifically the idea that they were patently *better* and that the contemporary world is best served in emulation, and assessed by approximation to the past, not validated on the basis of its own new merits.\n\nFor instance, the 1980s in the United States strikes me, for all of the real social problems occurring, to have been notably optimistic and forward-looking in its zeitgeist, represented by not only popular culture but in foreign policy and academia.

Washington knew that many Americans (including Congress) were getting impatient with his hesitance to assault the British army. He considered that it would look weak to allow them to march unresisted from Philadelphia to New York, and so he engineered a fight just for the sake of facing off the two armies. He didn't seem to truly attempt a strategic coup (like attacking the supply train,) he deliberately chose a smaller engagement that seemed largely designed to risk little while being able to say that we \"beat the British\". And while the claim of victory is not without merit (after all, the Continental Army stood toe-to-toe with the main force of the British Army, fought primarily against their elite units, and ended up taking the field and inflicting more casualties than they took) it seems the real objective was the generation of positive propaganda.\n\nSo, my question is, how effective was this propaganda? Did the Battle of Monmouth have a material impact in helping solicit contributions to the rebel cause? At this time, there were still a huge amount of Loyalists in the colonies - did news of Monmouth strike fear into these Loyalists and suppress their activities, and did it encourage those who were \"watching where the wind blows\" to join sides with the rebels? Were people more willing to accept Continental paper currency after hearing of this \"triumph\" of the Americans over the British?

During Georgia History, in the module on Cherokee history, the focus was on Andrew Jackson being an all around bad guy with no redeeming qualities, who was responsible for the trail of tears. Later in US history we were taught about how it was even worse because the Creek and Cherokee tribes helped him defeat the the English in the war of 1812. His success against the English helped him to gain wealth, and later to win the presidency and that him forcing all but a small few who sold out their kin off of the land was a personal betrayal to the very people who had put him in power. \n\nGoing off of these notions I figured it would be easy to find lots of examples of how he was a really bad president, and I was surprised that I'd never heard that:\n\n1. He almost sent the US to war with France because they refused to pay off debts they owed, and they backed down after England begged them not to start another war with the US.\n2. He won the election of 1824 against the secretary of state John Quincy Adams, the Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and a Georgian named William Crawford in the popular vote and in the electoral college, but didn't get enough electoral votes to get the Majority. the House of Representatives would have to vote for president with a single vote for each state. Adams won the vote and made Clay his Secretary of State, and Jackson claimed that Clay had approached him and offered to back him and have his supporters back him if he agreed to make him \"Secy\", and when he declined, Clay threw his support behind Adams, winning him the presidency. As a result of this he had a career long goal of abolishing the electoral college and setting up US elections as a popular vote.\n3. He believed that Adams had fumbled agreements with the Spanish and given Texas to them despite it being part of the Louisiana Purchase and he wanted Texas badly. He was opposed to violating the US treaty with Mexico and fired his Mexican ambassador for trying to bribe Mexican officials  into giving the land to the US without using the proper channels to get it. He was angry with Sam Houston, who he called a \"former friend\" after the fact, and Stephen Austin for taking Texas by force, and refused to aid them against Mexican soldiers and ships afterward. He was adamant about proving to Santa Anna that the US did not support or recognize the independence of Texas and did not aid them. \n4. After the nation of Texas was more well established, he refused to annex or admit it into the US out of fears that another pro-slave state would cause uproar and possibly lead to a civil war, despite being the orphan of poor Irish immigrants who got rich selling and trading slaves, who was known for being especially brutal to slaves.\n5. His primary work while in office was to oppose the Second Bank of the United States which was their equivalent of the federal reserve at the time. He was a populist who claimed the Bank\u2019s charter gave the institution too much power over the nation\u2019s financial markets, he argued\u2014power that enabled it to generate huge profits for its stockholders, most of whom were \u201cforeigners\u201d and \u201cour own opulent citizens.\u201d \u201cIf we must have a bank with private stockholders, every consideration of sound policy and every impulse of American feeling admonishes that it should be purely American,\u201d Jackson wrote. Daniel Webster and Henry Clay fought hard to protect the bank and Clay ran in opposition of Jackson for his second term expressly to protect its interests. He wrote that  \u201cIt is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes,\u201d and that \"This was unjust and dangerous to the humble members of society\u2014the farmers, mechanics and laborers\u2014who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves.\u201d \n\nAfter learning all this I am surprised more about him isn't common knowledge, I've never even heard Texans talk about his negative attitude towards their beloved fight for independence.\n\nDoes anyone think the Fed put him on the $20 bill out of spite?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1657506593.0},{"title":"When did humans predominantly cook and prepare food at home?","author":"SideOneDummy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vvscwe\/when_did_humans_predominantly_cook_and_prepare\/","text":"From my limited knowledge, cooking and baking began in most civilizations as a trade that not every family was required or had the technology\/resources to prepare on their own.

Promise them gold for a coup and then get shocked when they act violent and attack you when you don't pay them? \n\nYes. Terrible tragedy what happened to the civillians. Not unique for the era and had absolutely nothing to do with religion. I feel like I'm missing something here because the only thing I've gotten from all this was that you don't make debts you can't pay. Hell. The crusaders actually ran into the opposite side when attacking Zara because they were endebted to the Venetians for building a fleet three times their size. A fleet they obviously couldn't pay. They captured Zara to payed their due. Something the Byzantines couldn't or wouldn't do for them.\n\nAnd yes. It's sad what happened to the city itself. But after the kind of attitude Constantinople was having in the last 3 crusades and after being tired of doing nothing and with the fear of everything being for also for nothing it wouldn't take any hard convincing to do what the crusaders did. To grab as much gold as you can and go home. \n\nIn a few words. If the Byzantines didn't make false promises and didn't make debts they couldn't pay back then the Sack of Constantinople would've never happened.

No debate needed there.\n\nHowever, US support (or rather to me, maybe a confused sympathy) for right-wing fascism in 1930s Europe seems to have a less succinct record that is acknowledged.\n\nBefore World War 2, the Britain, France, and the U.S. committed to what I think was a position of malicious neutrality despite Axis aggression in the Spanish Civil War. Their choice to not supply arms to the Republicans to fight Francos' fascists in Spain (while pro-fascist American businesses supplied the Axis powers with oil) helped ensure that Germany and Italy had enough war-making capacity to fight in Central Europe. Roosevelt, to his credit, later admitted he was wrong. Harold Ickes, who was the U.S. Secretary of the Interior at the time, stated that \u201crealistically, neutrality in this instance \\[Spanish Civil War\\] was lining up with Franco, and lining up with Franco has meant the destruction of Democratic Spain.\u201d\n\nAfter World War 2, the U.S. incorporated not just Werner Von Braun into the space program, but major Nazi war criminals like [Reinhard Gehlen](https:\/\/ips-dc.org\/the_cias_worst-kept_secret_newly_declassified_files_confirm_united_states_collaboration_with_nazis\/), [Walter Rauff](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-15069333), [Kurt Blome](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kurt_Blome#Postwar_activities_and_employment_by_the_United_States), Klaus Barbie, and others who were put into places like the CIA or US-backed client-state dictatorships. Their crimes are truly horrendous and unconscionable, they were terrible spies, and it's all in the public record and the government knew about it at the time.\n\nI'd like to quote some revelatory quotes and points from several texts:\n\n\"A 1937 Report of the State Department's European Division described the rise of Fascism as the natural reaction of \"the rich and middle classes, in self-defense\" when the \"dissatisfied masses, with the example of the Russian revolution before them, swing to the Left.\" Fascism therefore \"must succeed or the masses, this time reinforced by the disillusioned middle classes, will again turn to the Left.\" The Report also noted that \"if Fascism cannot succeed by persuasion \\[in Germany\\], it must succeed by force.\" (\u201cState Department, 16 February 1937, \u201cMemorandum for the Honorable Norman H. Davis: A Contribution to a Peace Settlement,\u201d Box 24, Davis Papers.\u201d (If anyone has a link where the report could be read in full, I'd love to get that!)\n\n\"The U.S. Ambassador to Russia William Bullitt \"believed that only Nazi Germany could stay the advance of Soviet Bolshevism in Europe.\" (Daniel Yergin, Shattered Peace; p. 26) Harold Ickes, on the other hand, said \"the wealthy class of England is so afraid of Communism, which has constituted no threat at all in England, that they have thrown themselves into the arms of Nazism, and now they don\u2019t know which way to turn.\u201d Hitler apparently said to G. W. Ludeckel: \"I\u2019ve got to play ball with capitalism and keep the Versailles powers in line by holding aloft the bogey of Bolshevism\u2013make them believe that a Nazi Germany is the last bulwark against the Red Flood.\" (I Knew Hitler; p. 422)\n\nWithin the Chamberlain government, Under-Secretary Vansittart \"thought that Hitler was exploiting fears of a \"Bolshevist menace\" as a cover for \"expansion in Central and South-Eastern Europe,\" and one might argue that the views of Neville Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, and especially Neville Henderson might confirm that, even when people like Churchill and Vansittart seemed to know better.\n\nIn the British Press, William Shirer made note that Norman Ebutt \" complained to me in private that The Times \\[a major British newspaper\\] does not print all he sends, that it does not want to hear too much of the dark side of Nazi Germany and apparently has been captured by the pro-Nazis in London. He is discouraged and talks of quitting.\u201d\n\nSome further points:\n\nWhy is the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 never discussed? The agreement set no limits on ground forces and allowed the German Navy to be up to 35% of Britain's capacity. Is this not important at all? Is there more context to this? \"For it was obvious to the most simple mind in Berlin that by agreeing to Germany\u2019s building a navy a third as large as the British, the London government was giving Hitler free rein to build up a navy as fast as was physically possible\u2014one that would tax the capacity of his shipyards and steel mills for at least ten years. It was thus not a limitation on German rearmament but an encouragement to expand it, in the naval arm, as rapidly as Germany could find the means to do so.\u201d (William Shirer, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich) How about the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty that seemed borne out of at least a bare recognition by France and the Soviet Union that Nazi Germany posed a threat to Central Europe at that time? It seems notable to me that given this agreement, neither the Soviet Union nor Czechoslovakia were even invited to the Munich Conference where the matter of the Sudetenland, and the obvious implications for civil rights therein, was in question.\n\nI just have so many questions, but this aspect of the interwar period seems to never be fully entertained. It seems to me to be one of the most important lessons to learn in full. Was the U.S., Britain, and France complicit in the buildup to World War 2 to a degree greater than is acknowledged?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1657148530.0},{"title":"Salamo Arouch: The Jewish boxer forced to fight at Auschwitz in WWII","author":"Mammoth_Spend_5590","url":"http:\/\/www.atrboxing.news\/the-incredible-story-of-salamo-arouch\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1657055620.0},{"title":"Overlooked aspects of the \"classic\" depiction of Medieval Europe?","author":"Gliese581h","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vsmp0f\/overlooked_aspects_of_the_classic_depiction_of\/","text":"So, for a few years now, I've got a pet peeve regarding the depiction of Europe in medieval times in media, like games, movies, books or even toys.\n\nYou'd think that medieval Europe has been done to death, that other areas need to get their time to shine as well etc., and that's correct.\n\nHowever, I also feel that the \"classic\" depiction of what \"Medieval Europe\" is, is also so narrow and lacking, that even when you focus on central Europe, there's still so much to discover.\n\nAn example from my own childhood:\n\nDue to the common depiction of medieval castles in media, which focuses mainly on castles made of grey stone slabs, I thought there were absolutely no castles where I grew up.\n\nLater, I realized that that notion was quite stupid; while the area I grew up in isn't really all that important historically speaking, of course the counts and dukes built castles here.

It is well known that the lookouts that night did not have binoculars, but they really wouldn't have helped. In fact, they would have narrowed the lookouts' vision and made the iceberg even harder to see. Furthermore, there was an atmospheric phenomenon that raised the horizon that night called a cold-weather mirage, and it made it so the iceberg couldn't be seen until they were almost on top of it. Add that to just how dark it was at 11:30-40. How helpful would they have been\n2. I know this is weird to say, but extra lifeboats probably would not have saved as many lives as you might think. The lifeboats started to be lowered at 12:40-ish. By the time that the last two lifeboats (Collapsibles A and B, located next to the first funnel) were being prepared (2:05-2:15), the bridge was already flooding. The ship would last only 5 minutes more. They only had enough time for the 20, and even then, those two boats had to be floated off the ship in bad condition. Collapsible A was completely swamped , due to there not being enough time to raise the canvas sides, and Collapsible B got flipped upside down. Sure, some extra lifeboats could have been floated off, but due to the violent nature of the ship's last moments, how many lives could they have saved? Boat A had 13 people in it that survived the night (because everyone else in there had frozen to death), and Boat B had 29 men on top of it.\n\n\\*Edit\\* Yes, I fully understand that many of the lifeboats were launched half full, many even worse than that. I also understand that many of the lifeboats were lowered at around the same time. Yet even if all of the original lifeboats were loaded to capacity, that still would have been about 1,178 people out of 2,208. Even if more lifeboats were being loaded and launched, by the time Collapsibles A and B floated off, probably only 100-ish people would have been able to get off the ship in good condition. \n\n3.  There is no evidence that Bruce Ismay, chairman of White Star Line, goaded Captain Smith into running at full speed. He had a corporate mind, yes, but was not mindlessly reckless. It's possible his presence had an influence, but that is just speculation. Even then, the speed of the ship was normal. Second Officer Lightoller said in his British Inquiry testimony that it was common practice that a ship speed through an ice field to get through it as fast as possible. There were no \"villains\" in the Titanic story. No one was mindlessly reckless, nor had malicious intent, nor completely careless. Everyone was just trying to do their best. It was simply bad luck that the iceberg was struck, and struck in a way that highlighted the flaws the ship had.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1656993501.0},{"title":"Collection of letters to George III and George IV from rulers of Asian countries including China, India, and the Ottoman Empire now available online from the Royal Archives at Windsor","author":"yonkon","url":"https:\/\/georgianpapers.com\/2022\/07\/04\/asian-state-letters-now-available-on-the-georgian-papers-online\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1657026691.0},{"title":"Did the military defeats of the 15th and 16th centuries nearly break the European powers?","author":"MARTINELECA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vraod3\/did_the_military_defeats_of_the_15th_and_16th\/","text":"The year 732 is widely considered to be the absolute low point for Europe\u2019s morale, the Caliphate had recently conquered Iberia and occupied half of Francia and Gaul as well, but it must be considered that further acquisition of territory would eventually have sparked an armed struggle with the still very powerful Eastern Roman Empire. The situation in 1529 was much more dire, Constantinople had already fallen, the east Mediterranean, Balkans and Hungary gradually followed suit and a 100 000-strong hostile force had besieged Vienna. Even worse the Ottoman Empire was known to be planning to use the area as a staging point for a combined army of over 300 000 warriors and janissaries, raised with the express purpose of overrunning the rest of the European nations and bringing the entire continent under its control, forces that the defending Holy Roman Empire was coming under increasing financial strain to match.

Few instances & an attempt of cross-checking","author":"-introuble2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vplzem\/ammianus_marcellinus_on_magic_and_paganism_in_the\/","text":"Actually a short collection of excerpts, written by Ammianus Marcellinus in his Res Gestae of the 4th century CE, that are giving a view of magic & pagan practices and their treatment of his time by the Roman authorities; along with some really basic notes\/analysis. Surely not an exhaustive list, rather few excerpts containing indicative & interesting instances, that I've read lately.\n\nBesides of course my pure interest on the narrated facts, some thoughts occurred regarding **reliability**, too. Cause, as I've understood, Marcellinus being a pagan, hasn't always been considered totally objective by some scholars; especially regarding christianity.\n\nHowever I'm not sure if this would reach to the point of inventing stories, or it was just an implied stance. Barnes \\[2008, p. 2\\], though has suggested Marcellinus' bias and sometimes lack of objectivity, he's writing: \"*It is by far our fullest, most precise and most reliable narrative source for military campaigns and political events at the imperial court in the fourth century*\".\n\nIn any case, the excerpts were quite interesting.\n\n>\\* *Free renderings & translations of the latin & greek texts are mine. A translation of Marcellinus' history by John C. Rolfe of 1935, is given for each entry via perseus site, but with no different meanings; just for ease of access. Armenian texts are given via english or french translations.*\n\n**1. Sorcery & paganism are really close according to Marcellinus**\n\n[**Res Gestae 21.2.4**](http:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:21.2.4)\n\n>Marcellinus, narrating events of 360 CE, before Julian the apostate became emperor, is mentioning that Julian was still hiding his pagan identity, sharing it only with few. So he was practicing with them soothsaying\/divination \\[haruspicina\\] and augury \\[augurium\\], and all that the worshippers of gods always do \\[deorum semper fecere cultores\\]\n\nIt's obvious that Marcellinus thinks that the art of divination was usually practiced by pagans \/worshippers of \\[many\\] gods.\n\n**2. Persecution of magic\/paganism since Constantius II**\n\n[**Res Gestae 16.8.2**](http:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:16.8.2)\n\n>Marcellinus speaking generally for the year 358 CE, says that was condemned to death \\[poenaliter interibat\\] anyone who consulted an expert \\[peritus\\], i.e. soothsayer, about the sounds of a shrew-mouse \\[occentu soricis\\] or the crossing with a weasel \\[occursu mustelae\\], or anything similar, and even when one would search help to the incantations of an old woman \\[anile incantamentum\\] for the relief of pains.\n\n[**Res Gestae 19.12.14**](http:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:19.12.14)\n\n>Some chapters ahead for the year 359 CE, Marcellinus writes that was condemned to death, also, anyone who would wear an amulet for quartan ague or for pains, or anyone who would pass by a grave \\[monumentum\\] in the evening, as a poisoner\/sorcerer \\[veneficus\\], and collector of the horrors of tombs and of the vain sports of the wandering there ghosts.\n\nHarsh penalty for such 'crimes'.\n\nThough there's a thought that poisoning was criminalized more generally since the homicide law 'Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis' \\[80 BCE ca\\], it seems that there's none surviving clear legislation on magic, till the years of christianity in the Roman empire \\[check eg. Dickie, 2003, p. 242ff\\]. Just to have a clue, the main laws against magic and paganism have been issued since 319 CE \\[Constantine I the Great\\], usually in the form of decrees addressing to Prefects, and have been incorporated in the so-called Theodosian Code; chapters 9.16 De maleficis & 16.10 De paganis respectively \\[original latin text in [thelatinlibrary](https:\/\/www.thelatinlibrary.com\/theodosius.html) & suggested translation by [Pharr, 1952](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/theodosiancodeno0000unse_t2u1)\\].\n\nI'm giving here some notable highlights till the years of Valens.\n\n* 319 CE \\[Constantine I the Great\\]: it's forbidden the visit of a soothsayer \\[haruspex\\] in one's home. The soothsayer will be burned \\[concremando\\], and the one who called him will be exiled in an island \\[in insulam detrudendo\\]. While they are encouraged the public ceremonies, even to altars, to serve one's superstitions \\[CTh.9.16.1 & 2\\].\n* 321 CE \\[Constantine I the Great\\]: in the same spirit they were forbidden the domestic pagan sacrifices \\[sacrificiis domesticis\\] \\[CTh.16.10.1pr.\\].\n* 341 CE \\[Constantius II\\]: prohibition of superstitions and sacrifices in general, with vengeance and sentence \\[CTh.16.10.2\\]\n* 346 CE \\[Constantius II\\]: protection for the pagan temples outside the walls of the city, only as buildings \\[intactae incorruptaeque\\] \\[CTh.16.10.3\\]\n* 346 CE \\[Constantius II\\]: closing of pagan temples and prohibition of approach under the penalty of death by an avenging sword \\[gladio ultore\\] \\[CTh.16.10.4\\]\n* 353 CE \\[Constantius II\\]: prohibition of noctural sacrifices, that ursuper Magnetius had permitted \\[sacrificia nocturna\\] \\[CTh.16.10.5\\]\n* 357 CE \\[Constantius II\\] to the people: capital punishment with an avenging sword \\[gladio ultore\\] for soothsayers \\[haruspex\\], astrologers \\[mathematicus\\], wizards \\[magus\\], sorcerers \\[maleficus\\] fortunetellers \\[hariolus\\], and all who ask counsel from them \\[CTh.9.16.4\\]\n* 357 CE \\[Constantius II\\]: repetition of the sacrifice prohibition in general, under the penalty of death, but also of the worship of images \\[=colere simulacra\\] \\[CTh.16.10.6\\]\n* 358 CE \\[Constantius II\\]: will not escape the punishment and torture \\[tormentum\\], those who have rank \\[dignitas\\] if they would be soothsayers \\[haruspex\\], astrologers \\[mathematicus\\], wizards \\[magus\\], sorcerers \\[maleficus\\] fortunetellers \\[hariolus\\], augurs \\[augur\\], and the practicers of every art of divination \\[ars divinandi\\]. It's noticeable that it's written 'tormentum' \\[torture\\] & 'cruciatus' \\[torture\/crucifying\\] \\[CTh.9.16.6\\]\n* 364 CE \\[Valentinian and Valens\\]: suitable punishment for nefarious prayers, magical preparations and funeral sacrifices, during night-time \\[CTh.9.16.7\\]\n* 370 CE \\[Valentinian and Valens\\]: capital punishment for astrology teaching \\[CTh.9.16.8\\]\n* 371 CE \\[Valentinian, Valens and Gratian\\]: explicit exception of soothsaying \\[haruspicina\\] from any relation with sorcerers \\[maleficus\\] and superstition \\[religio\\]; thus no crime \\[CTh.9.16.9\\]\n\nAccording to these, the previous Marcellinus' narratives seem just an enforcement of law.\n\n**3. Athanasius bishop of Alexandria and Constantius II in 357; suspicions of sorcery**\n\n[Res Gestae 15.7.8](https:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:15.7.8)\n\n>On events of 356 CE ca, Marcellinus is writing few paragraphs around Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria. He's talking about a church council \\[synodus\\] that removed Athanasius from his position, cause \"he tried to learn external \\[things\\]\" \\[scitarique conatum externa\\]; as rumors \\[rumores\\] were saying. Then, he's adding \\[again as a saying: dicebatur\\], that Athanasius could predict future, being skilled in the prophetic lots \\[fatidicarum sortium\\] and in the prophecies indicated by the birds \\[augurales portenderent alites\\].\n\nTaking in account the context, this synod should be the one in Milan of 355. Athanasius, an orthodox bishop of Alexandria, is known for his fight against Arianism, which included synods, accusations, removals, exiles. And emperor Constantius II was most possibly a semi-Arian \\[see various spots in  Berndt & Steinacher 2014\\]. Marcellinus obviously chooses not to devote many words on Athanasius in his surviving work.\n\nAnd searching for some cross-checking, I saw that, though in Athanasius' works there're many implications of false-accusations, clear corresponding information can be seen in Sozomen's church history of the 5th c. CE \\[indicated by Vakaloudi, 2000, p. 343ff\\].\n\nAlready since Synod of Tyre in 335 CE \\[under Constantine I the Great\\], Athanasius was accused for sorcery \\[\u03b3\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\\]; so says Sozomen \\[[ChHist 2.25, PG 64, 1004-5](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=WivbHxo0L-sC&pg=PA1005#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II\/Volume_II\/Sozomen\/Book_II\/Chapter_25)\\] but also Theodoret of the 5th c. CE \\[[ChHist 1.28, PG 82, 988](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=SoHiFUO9LLYC&pg=PA987#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II\/Volume_III\/Theodoret\/Ecclesiastical_History\/Book_I\/Chapter_28)\\]. At another instance Sozomen writes \\[[ChHist 2.23, PG 67, 992-3](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=WivbHxo0L-sC&pg=PA993#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II\/Volume_II\/Sozomen\/Book_II\/Chapter_23)\\] that Athanasius was falsely accused by the christian sect of Melitians for killing a priest called Arsenius and keeping his arm for sorcery \\[\u03b3\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\\]. Sozomen \\[[ChHist 4.10, PG 67, 1133](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=WivbHxo0L-sC&pg=PA1133#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II\/Volume_II\/Sozomen\/Book_IV\/Chapter_10)\\] is also narrating how Athanasius was informed by god \\[\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\\] about a persecution and escaped. According to him, this and other similar incidents resulted to being slandered for sorcery \\[\u03b3\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\\] by opposing Greeks \\[i.e. pagans\\] and heterodox. And a picturesque incident occurred when Athanasius, walking in Alexandria, was asked to explain to the crowd what a crow was saying.\n\nSo at least it seems that Marcellinus' narrative is based somehow on truly said rumors; as they are reproduced by christian historians a little later.\n\n**4. Patricius and Hilarius, two tortured pagans**\n\n[Res Gestae 29.1.33](https:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:29.1.33)\n\n>In the start of the 29th book, on events of 371 CE, Marcellinus is describing how it was investigated and revealed a said 'plot' against emperor Valens. The Roman authorities in Antioch, starting with some irrelevant accusations, reached to a certain ex-governor Fidustius \\[praesidalis\\]. Fidustius confessed that with the help of the secret arts of Hilarius and Patricius, it was revealed to them the name of the future-successor of emperor Valens, namely Theodorus; Marcellinus adds that Fidustius was 'already tortured to death' \\[excarnificatus iam ad interitum\\].  \n>  \n>Marcellinus then is trying to justify Valens for his cruel reactions and precautions, calling him 'somehow foolish' \\[surrusticus\\] and describing recent plots against him that probably would have an effect at his judgement. He then adds that some details might have escaped from his memory but he would give a free summary of what he can remember \\[quae recolere possumus\\], giving the quick impression of being an eyewitness.  \n>  \n>Hilarius and Patricius were brought in front of the judges and described with some details their magic activities; their method was including a tripod, a hanging ring and letters, like a fortunetelling pendulum. And when they were asked, probaby ironically, if they had foreseen their sufferings, they answered with some greek lyrics that would underline their no-repentance. Marcellinus gave some that included a revenging for their blood Tissiphone and Ares. After these heard, they, being tortured with hooks, were taken away 'lifeless' \\[exanimes\\].\n\nThe term 'exanimes' has been interpreted as 'unconscious' rather than 'dead' \\[check eg. den Boeft et al., 2013, p. 56\\]. However I'm a little sceptical on this. The same incident, is given by the later pagan historian Zosimus of the 5th c CE \\[[New History 4.14-15](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=qN8TAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.livius](https:\/\/www.livius.org\/sources\/content\/zosimus\/zosimus-new-history-4\/zosimus-new-history-4.15\/)\\], where they are mentioned among others Hilarius of Phryia and Patricius of Lydia, philosophers, who were killed by the Romans under the possible charges of sorcery and conspiracy. In the general Zosimus' description of 'killing', the famous at the time philosopher Maximus of Ephesus was among the victims. On this Marcellinus agrees \\[[29.1.42](https:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:29.1.42)\\]; Maximus was beheaded \\[capite truncatus\\]. In any case I don't think that Hilarius and Patricius were spared in the end.\n\nZosimus is describing them as 'condemned by envy, rather than by fair vote', while Marcellinus is speaking about tortures. Forced confession?\n\nAnother notable observation seems to be made by Malingrey, but I didn't have direct access, only citations: Marcellinus \\[[29.1.44](https:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:29.1.44)\\] is mentioning some who managed to save their lives in the aforementioned mass persecution, that was committed by Valens. There's a recorded by scholars connection with a passage in St John Chrysostom's 3rd Homily 'De incomprehensibili dei natura' \\[38\\]. Chrysostom speaking in front of an audience of Antioch in 386 CE ca, he reminds them an incident \\[10 years before the speed\\] where the crowd of the city saved a man from \"the royal wrath\" in the hippodrome, at a time when plots against the king had occurred. It's noteworthy that Chrysostom is mentioning that the rescued \"was worthy of no pardon\" \\[check Harkins, 1984, p. 112 & den Boeft et al., 2013, p. 72\\].\n\nIn any case it seems here that fortune-telling was a means of the main accusation, that was conspiracy against emperor. However, mass persecution followed by Valens.\n\n**5. The wizard Armenian king Pap(a)**\n\n[Res Gestae 30.1.17](http:\/\/www.perseus.tufts.edu\/hopper\/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:30.1.17)\n\n>In 373 CE ca, Roman emperor Valens tried to imprison Pap(a), king of Armenia, probably for control; who in the end was murdered one year later. In any case, Valens at the time had sent two of his officers for this capture attempt, Danielus and Barzimeres, who after their failure, excused themselves by claiming that king Pap was a wizard. Specifically by: \"pretending that he \\[=Pap\\] had expertise, through enchantments of Circe, in transforming and debilitating \\[human\\] bodies in marvelous ways\". Claims that increased Valens' hatred to Pap.\n\nThe first two things I thought was firstly that Homeric sorceress Circe hadn't been forgotten and then that 'magic' was used easily for accusations in the 4th c. CE.\n\nBut then Barnes \\[2008, p. 81\\] indicated that Marcellinus mentions nothing about Armenian archbishop Nerses, whom king Pap poisoned and killed; according to the 5th c. Armenian historian P'avstos Buzand \\[[5.21-24](http:\/\/www.attalus.org\/armenian\/pb8.htm#24).\\]. Lenski \\[2014, p. 177\\] calls Nerses \"*close Roman contact*\", using mainly church sources; probably underlining the importance of the incident. In fact Marcellinus is referring mostly to a plot by Valens' officer Terentius, as a cause of the hostile emperor's attitude towards Pap. But Marcellinus uses the verb 'novimus' \\['we have learned'\\], indicating maybe some subjectivity. Additionally Nerses seems to be praised for his virtues by P'avstos Buzand of the 5th c., probably as a non-Arian but a christian of the Nicene Creed. Emperor Valens, however, was most possibly a semi-Arian, homoian \\[see various spots in Berndt & Steinacher 2014\\]. While Armenian king Pap seems to be an Arian, of an Arian king dynasty, according to all works I've read.\n\nGarsoian \\[1989, p. 10\\], commenting in general the Armenian history of P'avstos Buzand wrote of some relevant ignorance of facts, inaccuracies and anachronisms. The incident of the poisoning of Nerses by Pap(a) is described by two more Armenian sources of the time; Vita Nerses \\[12-14\\] & History by Movses Khorenatsi \\[3.38\\]. In all three works I've tracked at least one common anachronism or confusion at one other instance; all three are saying that Valens died before Nerses wrongly \\[P'avstos 4.13, V.Nerses 8, Khorenatsi 3.33\\].\n\nLenski \\[2014, p. 179\\] notices also that in the Armenian texts about Nerses, king Pap appears as possessed by demons \\[dews, devs\\]; using the argument actually as cross-checking with Marcellinus' narrative about sorcery.\n\n**Some consulted bibliography:**\n\n* Barnes, Timothy David, Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality, 1998 \/\/ in [https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=vLvlno4qmCkC](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=vLvlno4qmCkC)\n* Berndt, Guido & Steinacher, Roland, Arianism: Roman Heresy and Barbarian Creed, 2014 \/\/ in [https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=ZZtIBQAAQBAJ](https:\/\/books.google.gr\/books?id=ZZtIBQAAQBAJ)\n* J. den Boeft, J.W.

Today, Yunt Mountain is administratively located within the provincial borders of Manisa and \u0130zmir. Its total area is 3,521,70 km wide, and it is bordered by the Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay (ancient Kaikos) in the north, the Gediz (ancient Hermos) river in the south, K\u0131rka\u011fa\u00e7 and Akhisar plains in the east and the \u00c7andarl\u0131 Bay in the west. Highest peak of Yunt mountains, which consists of 500m-1000m hills and plains between them, stands at 1076 m. In ancient times, the mountain was the border between Mysia and Aiolis. The most important ancient settlement on the Yunt Mountain was Aigai. The archaeological data and border stones show that Aigai controlled most of the Yunt Mountain, especially in the Hellenistic Period. W.M. Ramsay suggests in his publication in 1890 that Aigai\u2019s borders were covering a large area. \n\nAiolis region, which includes an important part of the Yunt Mountain, is on the Western Anatolian shores and roughly covers the area between Gediz (Hermos) valley and Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay (Kaystros) and Lesbos Island. Aeolians living in the Aiolis region and speaking a dialect of Ancient Greek, came from the north of Greece and settled in the region. \n\nAccording to tradition, these immigrants coming from Boiotia and Thesselia regions to Anatolia settled in the Western Anatolian shores in the second half of 11th century BCE. Pseudo-Herodotus, the famous historian who lived in the first age, in his work \"The Life of Homer\", quotes that the migration of Aeolians to the northwestern Anatolian shores started with the invasion of Lesbos Island in 1140 BCE. According to him, Cyme was founded in 1120; Neonteichos in 1112; and Smyrna in 1102. The Byzantine historian Eusebius, on the other hand, only dates the foundation of Myrina among these cities, to 1047 BCE about a century later. \n\nFirst group of immigrants most likely have settled along the shore. Aigai, which is 13 km inland, must have been founded later. This can be explained by the first migrants initially taking control of the area on the shore, then colonizing the hinterlands due to the population growth. Archaeological excavations and research conducted at Aigai since 2004, show that the city was founded around 700 BCE. \n\nAncient geographer Strabo quotes that \u201cCyme is the best and largest of Aeolis cities. It can be said that Cyme and Lesbos are the metropolis (founder city) of other cities, of which up to thirty and many of which were destroyed. As can be understood from this statement, some of other Aeolian cities such as Aigai, must have been established by Cyme later. Hellenistic immigration, which had started with insufficient population to utilize hinterlands of Aiolis region as farmlands or pastures, made it necessary to expand into the hinterlands with the increase in population. \n\nAlso, Aeolian cities which are located on the coast and are economically developed, had to keep the hinterland under control for their protection. An important ancient route passing through the slopes of Aigai, which is located on one of the important valleys lays between Lydian land and the northwestern shores of Anatolia, was connecting Magnesia (Manisa) to Elaia, the ancient port of Pergamon, and Gryneion (Yeni \u015eakran). These routes clarify why the Aigaians chose the area. With the foundation of the ancient city of Aigai, Yunt Mountain region must have been controlled by the Aeolians beginning from the late 8th century BCE. \n\nThe name \u201cAigai\u201d is rarely encountered in ancient written sources. However, historical events that took place in the region must have directly affected the ancient city. Midas, the last king of the Phrygians, gained the trust of Greek rulers by getting married with Hermodike the daughter of the king of Kyme, the most powerful city of the Aiolis region. This marriage has been accepted as proof of direct or indirect relationship between the Phrygians and the Aeolians on the northwestern Anatolian coast in the first half of 7th century BCE. Lydians who saved Anatolia from the Kimmer threat was the most important power of the region since the 7th century BCE. The Lydian effect on Archaic pottery found at Aigai and imported Lydian pottery prove that the region was highly influenced by the Lydian culture in 7th and 6th centuries BCE. By 546-547, the western Anatolia began to be dominated by Persians. Xenophon, in his work Hellenika, mentions that Aigai and Temnos had resisted the Persian rule and maintained their independence (Xenophon, Hell. IV.8.5). Also, according to the text, Spartan commander Derkyllidas says that Aigai and Temnos had been independent since the beginning of Persian rule in order to convince his soldiers to march on the Persians at Aiolis. Their independence may have been caused due to the fact that the cities\u2019 location in a mountainous area and lack of Persians\u2019 attention to the two cities. \n\nAccording to Plutarch (Them, 26.1-4), the famous Athenian statesman Themistocles, turned his way to the city of Aigai, while fleeing from Greece towards Kyme in 471\/70 BCE, and without being seen, he was welcomed and hosted by his close friend Nikogenes. Then, he disguised as a woman, and continued on his way to Susa in a tent car. This proves the existence of wealthy and aristocratic families in and around Aigai from at least the 5th century BCE. Aigai was among the cities that did not pay tax to the Attica-Delos Sea League, which was established in the 5th century BCE against the Persian threat. Written sources dated to the 4th century BCE do not mention Aigai.\n\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, his successors, the Diadochi fought for control over the empire\u2019s land. Lysimachos lost his life after he was defeated at the Battle of Couroupedium against Seleucus, in 281 BCE. After the Battle of Couroupedium, in an environment of turmoil arising from the murder of Seleucus I, many cities gained their independence. A decree found in the Aigai excavations provides important information on this period. According to the decree, the Seleucid kings Seleuc\u0131s I Nicator and his son Antiochus I Soter were honored with divine attributes in the city. Also, this inscription, erected after the victory at the Battle of Couroupedium (281 BC), mentions the deeds Seleucus I and Antiochus accomplished for the city and the day Aigai gained its freedom.\n\nPergamon Kingdom put an end to the good relations they maintained with the Seleucids during the Eumenes I Period (263-241 BCE) and extended their boundaries to the north, east and southwest. During this period, control of Aigai must have passed to Pergamon Kingdom. During the Period of Attalus I, the defeat of Galatians (238\/237 BCE) and then the Seleucid king Antiochus Hierax (229-227 BCE), the Kingdom of Pergamon has become the most important power of the Western Anatolia. The important achievements of Attalus I did not last long. After the Seleucid attacks under the command of General Achaeus (223 BCE), Attalus I had lost Aigai and shores of the Aiolis. After the murder of Achaeus, who rebelled against Antiochus II (216 BCE), Pergamon Kingdom took control of Aigai and its surroundings again.\n\nThe Aiolis region and Aigai must have lived under the rule of Attalus Dynasty (Attalus I) between 218 and197 BCE. By the reestablishment of Seleucid control in the western Anatolia by Antiochus III in 197 BCE, the control of Aigai must have passed to Seleucids. Seleucids was forced to retreat to the south of the Taurus Mountains and leave the region by the Apamea Peace Treaty signed in 188 BCE. Aigai was also mentioned among the cities that gained their freedom after the Apamea Treaty. It is understood that Aigai and the whole Aiolis region has gained its independence.\n\nAccording to Polybius (His. XXXIII.13), Aigai was damaged during the war between Attalus II and Prusias II, king of Bithynia, in 156-154 BCE. In 154 BCE, Prusias II paid 100 talents as compensation to the cities damaged. Monumental public buildings such as Bouleuterion, Agora Building, Theater and Gymnasion were built at exactly this period, just after the middle of the 2nd century BCE. Attalus III donated his kingdom to Rome with a rational political decision, before his death in 133 BCE. After this date, Aigai and the surrounding region continued to exist under the rule of Rome. The earliest evidence of Roman rule in Aigai is from the 1st century BCE.\n\nProconsul Publius Servilius Isauricus, a reliable man and close friend of Ceasar, helped the city and made donations for the Temple of Apollo Chresterios during his tenure as Governor of Asia (46-44 BCE). A dedicatory inscription on a sculpture base from Aigai shows that Publius Servilius Isauricus was honored in Aigai for his help. Similarly, Publius Servilius Isauricus reestablished traditional laws and independent democracy in Pergamon, and because of this, he gained the title of \"savior and benefactor of the city\".\n\nAccording to ancient writers, one of the biggest earthquakes in Anatolian history, occurred in 17 CE. Roman historian Tacitus provides detailed information about this earthquake and gives the names of the most affected cities as Sardis (Salihli) and Magnesia (Manisa). Tacitus said, \u201c...in the same year, the twelve important cities of Asia were destroyed at midnight by an earthquake.\" Roman emperor Tiberius was not very willing to help the states. However, he had made donations to Aigai and other eleven Western Anatolian cities for the destruction caused by the earthquake. A monument to honor the emperor in response to the help he had done was erected in Puteoli by the twelve Anatolian cities. There is no doubt that Yunt Mountain and other cities in the Aiolis region were also affected by the earthquake of 17 CE.\n\nThe Goths, a nomadic tribe, destroyed and sacked many cities in the second half of the 3rd century CE.  The traces of Goths threat that appeared around 260 CE, are possible to see in Aigai. The blockage by walls of the doors of the buildings dated to the 3rd century CE, show the Aigaians were aware of the approaching Goths threat. Archaeological data obtained from the excavations prove that the city was deliberately abandoned by settlers. Coins hidden in a cistern and dated to the 3rd century CE suggest that the settlers were planning to return the city. It is not known where Aigains and other settlers who lived on the Yunt Mountain area were fled at the time of the Goth danger. However, it is clear that they could not return to their cities.\n\nAfter being abandoned in the 3rd century CE, Aigai was settled again after nearly a thousand years. The last period of settlement in the city dated to the late 12th century CE. Evidence of the late Byzantine castle-settlement dated to this period is limited to the Eastern Church area. Remains of Byzantine buildings and tombs were unearthed around the church which had served a small Christian community. After the 1280s, the small Byzantine settlement at Aigai must have had its share from the Turkmen attacks took over the lands of Western Anatolia. A date around 1300 at the latest is thought of for the settlement of Turkmen groups in the area.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1656600427.0},{"title":"Electric cars from the past","author":"Durable_me","url":"https:\/\/www.sytner.co.uk\/news\/history-of-electric-cars\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1656580880.0},{"title":"Last World War II Medal of Honor recipient, West Virginia native Hershel 'Woody' Williams dies at 98","author":"_THX_1138_","url":"https:\/\/www.wowktv.com\/news\/local\/last-world-war-ii-medal-of-honor-recipient-wv-native-hershel-woody-williams-dies-at-98\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1656506354.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vnd2rz\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

In China, this dynasty is known for its oppressive rule and the building of the first version of the Great Wall of China (yes, there are multiple versions).\n\n**The rise to dominance of the state of** ***Qin:*** For a long time, the state of *Qin* was the weakest\\* state of the Warring States period. To understand the rise to dominance of this vassal state, we have to go back all the way to the year 905 BCE. At this time period, because of his ability to raise horses, a man named *Qin Feizi* gained the favor of the current *Zhou* king. With the rapid expansion of the *Zhou* dynasty because of the system of feoffment\\*\\*, *Qin Feizi* was granted the land of *Qin*, and he became the first feudal lord of the *Qin* state (imagine becoming the leader of a small country because you\u2019re good at taming horses\u2026). Hundred years passed with little to no change (this is obviously simplified), until a philosopher and politician named *Shang Yang* (\u5546\u9785), a frustrated official in *Wei (\u536b\u56fd)*, came to the state of *Qin*. At the time, duke *Xiao* of the *Qin* state was seeking for talented people, and *Shang Yang* was that talent. After some deliberation, the duke of *Qin* decided that being one of the weakest states of the Warring States period, he had no chance to win and unify China without radical reforms, so in 356 BCE, he appointed *Shang Yang* to reform his state.\n\n**What in the world is Legalism?** To really understand the reforms of *Shang Yang*, (and those of the *Qin* dynasty in general) it\u2019s useful to understand the philosophy that was behind his and most of the *Qin* dynasty's reforms: Legalism (at that time the idea of a philosophy named \u201cLegalism\u201d may not have existed; this word is something historians made up afterwards\u2026). I will go into more detail about what Legalism is in a dedicated post about the religions of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, but since this is a very \u201cbrief\u201d overview, this is the short version: At the core of Legalism is the belief that people are naturally selfish and short-sighted (very positive\u2026). Therefore, legalists believed in using laws to lead society by exacting harsh punishments on those who didn't act correctly, and rewarding does who\u00a0behaved. Compared to legalists, *Confucius* believed in the morality\/goodness of people. Therefore, he believed that if the ruler of a country acted with goodwill, his people would follow his guidance and also be virtuous and moral. To achieve this goal of using laws to lead society, legalists believed in reforms that centralized power and built absolute obedience of the populous. A frequently asked question when talking about philosophy\/religions is who created this philosophy\/religion? The answer for Legalism is that we don\u2019t know. Legalism has changed so much with so many philosophers adding to it that there simply isn\u2019t a clear answer to who \u201ccreated it\u201d. Generally though, it is agreed that the representative figure of Legalism is a man named *Han Feizi (\u97e9\u975e\u5b50)*. *Han Feizi* is known for contributing massively to Legalism not by helping to reform a country like *Shang Yang* did, but by writing multiple books about the philosophy that is Legalism, which later on would be read and its ideas used by the first emperor of China, *Qin Shi Huang (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687)*.\u00a0\n\n**The reforms of** ***Shang Yan*****g:** Though *Shang Yang* did not make many reforms to the state of *Qin*, the reforms still had a strong and long-lasting impact. *Shang Yang*\u2019s reforms took power away from the nobility and focused the economy on building a powerful military might to rival all of the state's enemies. Shang Yang\u2019s Reforms:\n\n1. **Governmental Reforms:** Establishment of the county system (\u53bf\u5236), which made that the duke of *Qin* directly chose who was sent to govern different areas of the nation, which abolished the hereditary privileges of the nobility. Reforming the household registration (\u6237\u7c4d) system, strengthening control on the population and where they lived. The creation of stricter laws and harsher punishments, leading to less crime.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n2. **Economical Reforms:** The abolishment of the well-field system\\*\\*\\* (\u4e95\u7530\u5236) which was a system in which farmers had one plot of land where all the crops would go to them, and a central plot of land where everything would go to the government, which would then give some of the crops to the nobility. This system was ineffective because if you were a peasant, you would focus more energy on working the plot of farmland that you would get all the resources from than the one which you got nothing from. Therefore, *Shang Yang* changed the agricultural system into a system similar to the one we know today in most countries, where all land can be sold and bought freely with taxes levied by the government (yeah, China\u2019s agricultural system hasn\u2019t really changed much over the years). Other economical reforms were f.ex. encouraging the production of grain and cloth by removing corvee\/free labor requirements for people who were farming those crops as well as uniting the measuring system (\u5ea6\u91cf\u8861).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n3. **Military reforms:** Compulsory military service. Rewarding military service by granting titles and land-based on how many enemies you killed. This helped make people more willing and enthusiastic to fight, since at that period of time, this was one of the only ways to climb up the social ladder.The big issue with Shang Yang\u2019s reforms, is that as we say in Chinese: he touched the nobility\u2019s cake\/\u78b0\u4e86\u8d35\u65cf\u7684\u86cb\u7cd5 (yeah, that one was lost in translation\u2026).\u00a0Essentially, by trying to centralize the government, *Shang Yang* took a lot of power away from the nobility, and they were not thrilled. Therefore, after the death of duke *Xiao, Shang Yang* would meet a tragic death by dismemberment\u2026 (\u8f66\u88c2).\n\n**Tactics of the state of** ***Qin:*** Because of the reforms of *Shang Yang* and many other Legalist philosophers, the state of *Qin* gradually became the No.1 superpower in the Eastern *Zhou* dynasty. This led the other six major states to form a coalition against the nation of *Qin*. The issue with this coalition was that the six major states only formed it out of necessity, and long rivalries between some of the major states led to a very weak alliance network, which *Qin* exploited. Long story short, *Qin* allied with the states that were further away, using their help to crush the states close to *Qin*. Then, *Qin* betrayed their allies and conquered all of China. Though this strategy certainly worked, it caused the nobility of the states who were betrayed to hate the state of *Qin*, and as they were not executed because of the two crownings and three respects\/\u4e8c\u738b\u4e09\u606a system, these nobles would later cause issues within the *Qin* dynasty and lead to its downfall.\n\n**Issues within the** ***Qin*** **dynasty\/The downfall of the** ***Qin*** **dynasty:** There are many reasons that caused the downfall of the *Qin* dynasty, but in this post, I will only be talking about the 4 main reasons. Heavy taxation and corv\u00e9e: Once the *Qin* dynasty defeated all the other warring states, it had countless infrastructure that needed repairing. On top of that, the *Qin* dynasty built great monuments and palaces that though certainly beautiful, were very expensive. To fund these projects, not only did the emperor make the populous pay absurd taxes in contrast to the *Zhou* dynasty, he also coerced the people of China into going to far-flung places to work on infrastructure, providing no labor fee. Harsh punishments and harsh laws: Though crime rates went down with fear of punishment, many of these \u201claws\u201d were too strict, leading to the *Dazexiang (\u5927\u6cfd\u4e61)* uprising and people\u2019s constant fear of death because of the law. Lack of new talent and the constriction of ideas: The burning of books and burying of *Confucian* scholars alive (\u711a\u4e66\u5751\u5112) event is a classic (by classic, I don\u2019t mean good) example of how the *Qin* dynasty tried to unify the different schools of thought under legalism. This caused the drying up of talented officials who had innovative ideas and a growth in corrupt officials. Unhappy nobility: After the *Qin* dynasty defeated the other warring states, the nobles of these nations still had significant power, and they resented the emperor.\u00a0These elements together with others brought down the Qin empire, and with it, so went legalism (kind of.., it's complicated). With the fall of *Qin* and the Legalist ideas, we can also slowly see the rise of *Confucian* ideals under the *Han* dynasty.\n\n\\* There were other smaller states than Qin in parts of the Warring States period, but they are too insignificant to talk about in this brief overview. In the Warring States period, there were seven powerful states: *Qi* (\u9f50), *Chu* (\u695a), *Yan* (\u71d5), *Han* (\u97e9),\u00a0 *Zhao* (\u8d75),\u00a0 *Wei* (\u9b4f), and *Qin* (\u79e6).\n\n\\*\\* The system of feoffment in the Zhou dynasty has similar properties to that of the western feudal system, but is not the same. Here is the link to an article that talks about this: [The differences between European feudalism and Chinese feudalism](https:\/\/www3.nd.edu\/~pmoody\/Text%20Pages%20-%20Peter%20Moody%20Webpage\/Feudalism.pdf).\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\* The existence of such a system of servitude renting is still contested, although we have multiple written records talking about this system existing and how it functions, we are yet to find any archaeological evidence.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1656052325.0},{"title":"Your favorite explorer\/voyage in human history?","author":"Altruistic-Ad6507","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vj5rhf\/your_favorite_explorervoyage_in_human_history\/","text":"Mine mIght be basic but Marco Polo has always stuck out to me.

Unlike its eternal rival Genoa, which was invaded by the Lombards, incorporated into the Frankish Empire, then the Holy Roman Empire, sacked by the Egyptians, etc etc, Venice was part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, the Byzantines' last remaining territory on mainland Europe west of the Balkan peninsula.\n\nThe Venetians were subjects of the Byzantine Emperor.

Known as the Guerillo Heroico it is the popular image of him staring stoically in the distance. That image has been reproduce millions of times over on T shirts, plaques and statues across the globe to symbolise many things ranging from defiance, to martyrdom to revolution. The historical context of the image however is what is called the \"La Coubre Explosion\".\n\nBasically a French vessel that had left the port of Antwerp in Belgium full of munitions and landed in the harbors of Havana. Che was at a meeting of what was called the National Institution of Agrarian Reform to implement the Cuban revolution's land reform program. When the vessel exploded it ended up killing 75-100 people and wounding 200. Che was in the vacinity and drove his car to the area. Because he was a doctor by training Che personally administered first aid treatment to the victims. In the aftermath of the incident a national funeral was held. Fidel Castro presided over the funeral and many Cuban officials as well as international delegates were present. The famous French existentialist philosopher Jean Paul Sartre and his romantic partner and feminist author Simone De Beavoir were in the crowd with Che Guevara listening to Fidel Castro's speech. In this context Fidel Castro delivered a blistering condemnation of America, accusing them of being behind the sabotage of the La Coubre. There is no hard evidence for this accusation. However the context of this accusation was the deteriorating relations with the U.S during the Eisenhower Administration in 1960. Castro and Che had nationalised American industries and pursued land reform as well as stronger ties with the Soviet Union. As a result the Eisenhower Administration began the policy of economically isolating Cuba as well as plots to overthrow Castro's government by training counter revolutionary movements(Escambray Rebellion), assassination attemptions, and preparations for the Bay of Pigs which would take place in 1961. In the context of this speech when he was in the crowd of delegates with Sartre and De Beavoir Che's stoic image was caught. Since the Cuban revolutionaries believed America was behind the explosion(which we don't have definitive proof of) its almost as if Che is looking defiantly at the circumstances and also expecting the worst later on(which would happen in the Bay of Pigs).\n\nThe second interesting context that's hinted at is the French. This was a French vessel that exploded in Havana. That contextualises Sartre and Simone De Beavoir's presence. But they had visited Cuba months earlier to have philosophical discussions with Che due to the fact that French intellectuals and political activists had been fascinated by the Cuban revolution and Che himself. Che would later go on a official state visit to France in 1964 and in 1967 when he was leading his insurgency in Bolivia before execution one of the combatants in his rank was a French intellectual and philosopher named Regis Debray. Debray would eventually go to serve and be a major advisor to the French President Francois Mitterrand. Now does anyone think this historical context ads any significance to the image(regardless of what you think of Che personally) or does the image itself just stand alone?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1655700172.0},{"title":"How to learn and understand history?","author":"athej_b","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vgpr2a\/how_to_learn_and_understand_history\/","text":"Hello!

Most people I know focus on the many cultural, educational, agricultural, and religious innovations during the Zhou Dynasty, so instead, I will focus more on the military and governance aspects in this post.\n\n**The** **Zhou Dynasty (\u5468\u671d) and the periods it is divided into:** The Zhou dynasty, like most long-lasting Chinese dynasties, is divided into two different periods: Western and Eastern Zhou dynasty. At the end of the Western Zhou dynasty, a tribe of nomadic peoples invaded the capital, killing the current Zhou king\\* named You Wang (\u5468\u5e7d\u738b). Because of this, the Zhou dynasty moved their capital from Xi\u2019an to Luoyang (both of these are classic capitals of the Chinese dynasties), and placed a new king named Ping Wang (\u5468\u5e73\u738b) on the throne. The issue with this new king was that he only had power in name, essentially being a puppet emperor. From this period onwards we start a \u201cnew\u201d dynasty: The Eastern Zhou dynasty (this dynasty is itself divided into two periods that will be mentioned below).[ Zhou Dynasty Illustration](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1ynLCxEh-KKcvmH_mRpkZKaqxdsq_qEJl9njfwSyjPZo\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**What is special about the Zhou Dynasty?** The Zhou dynasty was the third or second (this is debated) dynasty in Chinese history, lasting from 1050\u2013221 BCE. One of the main attributes of the Zhou dynasty is a new system of governance instituted by King Wu (the Zhou dynasty\u2019s first king). The idea of this decentralized state system was to give land to many different nobles, stabilizing the kingdom and making it easier to govern. This also gave the Zhou dynasty the ability to expand the amount of land controlled, as the administrative problems could be solved locally by this system of feoffment\\*\\*(\u5206\u5c01\u5236)\n\n**The downsides of the Chinese feudal system:** Although this system had many benefits, it also had some crucial downsides which would later lead to the collapse of the Zhou dynasty. Over the centuries the Zhou dynasty ruled (the Zhou dynasty is the longest-lasting dynasty of Chinese history, so it ruled for quite long), the nobles became more and more powerful, slowly building sizable armies. The first batches of nobles who were given the land by the King of Zhou might have had qualms fighting him, the descendants of those nobles though, were not as loyal. This gradually led to what is called the Spring and Autumn period. During this time period, the king of Zhou was therefore only king in name, having minimal land (personally controlled) and power.\n\n**The Spring and Autumn period:** The Spring and Autumn period lasted from approximately 770 to 476 BCE, while the Warring States period lasted from 476 to 221 BCE. These two periods that are part of the Eastern Zhou dynasty are marked by a change in power of the vassal states. In the Spring and Autumn period, everyone still cared about the mandate and power of the king, following his rules. If they wanted to fight wars against other vassal states, they used the justification of \u201cdefending\u201d the king. Furthermore, traditional rite of war was mostly followed. For example, fighting with relatively \"fair conditions\" was the \u201chonorable\u201d way, and there were many stories of generals refusing to attack when the enemy was not in position yet. Another example would be that depending on the rank of the feudal lords, a feudal lord might only be permitted to field a certain amount of troops.\n\n**The Warring States period:** Once we reach the Warring States period, everyone stopped paying attention to the king. Feudal lords openly fought each other without justification. The goal was to defeat the enemy and become king themselves, so any strategy that could achieve that goal became valid. Massive reforms were also commonplace in the Warring States period, with many states changing from a slave-based agricultural system (which was the norm at that time) to a feudal-type system (that doesn\u2019t mean slavery was abolished though, that would take another 2000 years).\n\n**Army sizes:** The final important difference between the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period was army size. Agricultural advancements, advances in metallurgy, and the increasing size of the vassal states (which had absorbed other smaller states) led to significant increases in army sizes. During the Spring and Autumn period, armies had not surpassed several 10,000 troops. In the Warring States period though, armies reached more than several 100,000 troops (these numbers may be exaggerated, since we don\u2019t know how reliable our sources are).\n\nI hope you liked this brief overview, and that you might want to discover more about this fascinating era of Chinese history!\n\n\\*I use king instead of emperor in this post because that is what everyone at that time called their rulers. The Chinese word for emperor (\u7687\u5e1d) was created only after the collapse of the Zhou dynasty by the first ruler of the Qin dynasty: Qin Shi Huang (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687).\n\n\\*\\*This system should not be equated with the much later occurring European contractual feudalism, which has certain distinctions to the Zhou Dynasty's lineage feudalism.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1655529233.0},{"title":"A widely believed history myth: No, \"true\" Damascus steel is not a \"lost art\"","author":"IPostSwords","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vdvtrh\/a_widely_believed_history_myth_no_true_damascus\/","text":"Because it has come up repeatedly over the last week on subreddits I moderate, I thought I'd revise and repost this quick explainer on the very prolific myth that \"true\" damascus steel is a lost art.\n\n\nFirst of all, let's clarify what I mean when I say \"True Damascus Steel\", because it is very easy to become mired in definitions and ambiguity.\n\n[Top: Ottoman Pala, Pattern welded. Bottom, Iranian Shamshir, Crucible steel.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oj7m6y0k3e591.jpg?width=6733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be106e56821267c4dfb0c9c1707143f878f62c87)\n\n**\"Damascus steel\" usually refers to two main types of steel**:\n\nThe most common you'll see made today is \"**pattern-welded steel**\", where alternating layers of nickel rich and nickel deplete steel are stacked, forge welded, and **folded** or manipulated to create a pattern. The blade is then polished and etched to reveal the layers. While modern pattern welded blades typically use nickel containing steels to maximise contrast, historically this was not the case.\n\nThis method of construction using stacked, folded or otherwise forge welded, dissimilar* steels is how the majority of sword steels were made, worldwide, until advances in technology allowed for the use of more homogenous steel products. Pattern welding, and variants such as multibar patterns and laminated blades, were used widely and includes swords like spatha, \u201cviking\u201d swords, katana and more. It is worth noting that even \"monosteel\" swords which were made without the use of dissimilar steel, but still made from bloomery or refined blast furnace steel, were also subject to similar stacking, folding and forge welding techniques.\n\n*Bloom is here considered to contain multiple dissimilar steels due to the heterogeneous nature of bloom. \n\nThis description of pattern welding and forge consolidated steels is intentionally simplified as they are not the focus of todays post, however for more information - particularly on bloomery and blast furnace production of steels - I recommend \"The Knight and the Blast Furnace\" by Alan Williams.\n\nIn the present day, this is the type you will see chef\u2019s knives, swords, and even pocket knives being made of, and it can range from being rather cheap to incredibly expensive depending on the materials and workmanship.\n\n[Pattern welded Pala blade in \\\\\"Turkish Ribbon Twist\\\\\" style.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ijgu7seo3e591.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=630b2d095047fcd34d73f1e37c87db156a4f195a)\n\nThe other type of \"Damascus Steel\" is a form of hypereutectoid, pattern forming **crucible steel.**\n\nAnd that is what I will be discussing today.\n\nIt is a hypereutectoid steel, which means that it has over 0.8% carbon by definition. It is formed by liquifying steel in a crucible, and is **NOT** **produced by folding** or layering steel. The typical composition is around 1% to 2% carbon, which by modern standards makes this an \u201cultra-high carbon steel\u201d, often abbreviated as UHCS.\n\nIt is formed by melting steel with specific impurities in a crucible (historically, made of high kaolin content clay, rice husks as chaff, quartz sands, and other additives), and the process of turning this crucible \u201ccharge\u201d into steel is quite complicated, with the potential for failure to produce an attractive pattern being high if any part of the process is not conducted correctly.\n\nIn summary, the crucible charge is brought up to melting temperature, and held at this temperature for a while, allowing the constituent alloying elements present in the steel to spread and bubbles to boil out. It is then slowly cooled, before the ingot is removed, roasted to decarburise the rim, drawn out into a bar, manipulated to produce a surface pattern with ball peens, wedges and grinding, and finally forged it into a blade, and thermally cycled.\n\nAs stated, this steel is typically the range of carbon content is between 1 and 2% in historical examples, and thus melts in a temperature range between 1200 and 1400c (for more information, see \u201ciron carbon phase diagrams\u201d). It must also have sufficient levels of carbide formers (vanadium, molybdenum, manganese etc) in order to form patterns (Verhoeven et al, 1998,. Verhoeven et al 2018).\n\nThe pattern in crucible steel are formed by \"rafts\" of steel rich in carbide formers, where ultra-hard cementite spheroids form over subsequent forging cycles, which etch bright, and areas devoid of carbide forming elements (CFEs), which remain as pearlite, a soft mix of carbides which etches dark. The shape and size of the rafts is determined by the length of dendrites that form during the slow cooling of the ingot, as dendritic regions of the steel are carbide former depleted, and interdendritic regions are carbide former rich (Verhoeven et al, 2018).\n\n[Crucible steel shamshir blade, kara Khorasan pulad](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rbchxn5t3e591.png?width=8091&format=png&auto=webp&s=6081374d34827d01a9493c3673aeddc09372cbb0)\n\nMany people conflate pattern-welded steel with crucible steel, and call both \u201cDamascus\u201d. Whilst this is accepted in colloquial language, it is important to distinguish between the two \u2013 particularly when it comes to identifying antiques, or documenting them.\n\n\"Damascus\" can therefore be used to refer to either pattern welded, or crucible steels, as both are pattern-forming steels, but it is best to specify which sort of \"Damascus\" is being discussed. The term has been used historically to describe both pattern-welded steel and crucible steel. Many swords and gun barrels made in germany were marked \"damastahl\" in the 18th and 19th century, and they were pattern welded, so there is historical precedent for such a naming convention, but the two techniques (and end products) are very different.\n\n**To be ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: \"True\" damascus steel is herein used as a term to refer to historical, patterned crucible steel. I am using this term entirely because it is understandable. The correct naming and etymology is discussed later. Both pattern welded and crucible steel blades can be called \"damascus\", and were historically, but the \"lost\" form is the crucible steel form.**\n\n**The Myth: \"Damascus Steel is a Lost Art\":**\n\nThe is quite a long history of crucible \u201cDamascus\u201d steel, in the form of primary sources in which the process was written down - as early as 350BCE - 420BCE Zosimus, an early alchemist in Alexandria, wrote the following:\n\n>\"The tempering of Indian Iron: Take 4 pounds of soft iron, and the skins of myrobalans, called elileg, 15 parts; belileg, 4 parts; and two parts of glassmakers magnesia. Then place it into a crucible and make it level. .... Put on the charcoal and blow the fire until the iron becomes molten and the ingredients become united with it. ... Such is the premier and royal operation, which is practiced today and by means of which they make marvelous swords. It was discovered by the Indians and exploited by the Persians\".\n\nThis is by no means the only method to make crucible steel - some was co-fusion, using both cast iron and bloom, while some was indeed made with bloomery and carbon bearing material (often plants).\n\nIncidentally, the oldest known crucible steel sword is from the 6th to 3rd century BCE and was found interred in a megalithic site in Thelunganur, Tamil Nadu, India (Ramesh et al, 2019) and daggers from \\~500BCE have been found with the associated production site in Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu (Sasisekaran & Rao, 1999. Sasisekaran, 2002). This is consistent with the Zosimus account describing the technique as discovered by India.\n\n[Thelunganur sword, Ramesh et al 2019](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cfthvr2f4e591.jpg?width=2128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8141215372f59d840de48a1f9237b31689535a4)\n\nThe Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi - circa 800CE - 873CE) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni - circa 973CE - 1048CE) both wrote detailed procedures for the production of crucible steel, too.\n\n\u2060This is how Biruni described it in the manuscript Al-Jam\u00e2hir Marefat al-Jaw\u00e2her. (From Khorasani et al, 2013):\n\n>\u201cHe says that they \\[ironwokers\\] include five ratl \u0631\u0637\u0644 of \\[horse\\] shoes, the nails of which are made of narm\u00e2han \u0646\u0631\u0645\u0622\u0647\u0646\\] in the crucible\\].

Then they fill the furnace with charcoal and blow air with Rumi (Roman Byzantine\/Anatolian) bellows that are pumped by two men until the iron melts. Then they add a combination of halile \u0647\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0647) myrobalan), pust-e an\u00e2r \u0627\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u067e\u0648\u0633\u062a) pomegranate peel), melh al-ajeyn \u0645\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062c\u064a\u0646) the salt used for dough), and sadaf-e morvarid \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0635\u062f\u0641) pearl shell). From each the same amount approaching forty derham \u062f\u0631\u0647\u0645 are placed into small bags. One small bag is then added to each crucible. They keep heating vigorously without pause for one hour and then stop the heat. After it cools off, they take out the iron ingot (egg) from the crucibles. A person said that he was sitting next to a smith who was making swords in the province of Send \u0633\u0646\u062f\\] Sind\\]. He saw that the smith was using narm\u00e2han \u0646\u0631\u0645\u0622\u0647\u0646 and putting a very soft, ground mixture, which had a red color on it. Then the smith placed it in the furnace, and took it out and hammered it, and continued this process a couple of times. When asked why he did that he looked contemptuously. When he \\[the person sitting next to the smith\\] looked closely, he saw that the smith was hammering and mixing dus \u062f\u0648\u0635 with narm\u00e2han \u0646\u0631\u0645\u0622\u0647\u0646 the same way they made iron ingots (eggs) in Herat.\u201d\n\nThe metallurgical research into how this steel gets its patterns spans back far, with Michael Faraday (yes, that Faraday) having published a paper on recreating Indian crucible steel (known to him as wootz) in 1819, with subsequent papers in 1820 and 1822. It wasn't until 1837 when Pavel Anasov, a Russian metallurgist and director of the Zlatoust arms factory, that it was successfully recreated in any substantial quantity. Since then, research has been done on modern steels (Sherby and Wadsworth, 1983) and on historical blades, revealing the mechanisms by which the patterns forms (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\nAnosov was a metallurgist and Colonel of the Russian Army during the occupation on the Emirate of Bukhara in the 1820\u2019s, when he established contact with steelmakers in the region and attempted to recreate the steel in his steelworks in Zlatoust, but after failing asked Captain Massalski (results published 1841) whose regiment was stationed there, to observe the process and undertake further observations.\n\nMassalski documented the Bukhara method, noting 3 key metals, cast iron, iron, and silver. Massalski stresses the ratio of one part iron, 3 parts cast iron (N.B: a co-fusion method of making steel with the right amount of carbon) and the crucibles hold around 2.5kg of steel, making up 1\/3rd of the potential capacity of the crucible.\n\nThe metal workers start the fire and the metal begins to melt after some 5 to 6 hours, and makes a bubbling sound. When the bubbling sound ends, this is a sign that the fusion has ended. The workers remove the lid, add 0.013kg to 0.017kg of silver, stir rapidly with an iron rod, cover the charge with charcoal, and cover again with the lid. (N.B: this was a potentially primitive form of \"killing\" the steel, a process by which reactive elements in the charge react with another reactive metal - silver in this case, aluminium in modern times - and are thus removed from the reaction, resulting in less porosity due to gas production. The other method of degassing historically used was simply holding the ingot at the molten, liquidus temperature for longer). \n\n* N.B: Silver is not particularly reactive, so the purpose of silver might not have been killing the steel. The atmosphere and composition of a crucible melt, as well as the 1400-1500c temperature at which silver was added require further investigation to determine the mode of action. it may be that the liquid silver was moving into the grain boundaries of the steel during solidification, displacing phosphorus or sulphur.\n\nThey return the crucible to the fire and allow it to cool as the charcoal burns out, slowly, over 3 days. After cooling, the ingot is removed and tested by polishing to check for dendrites. The steel then passes to smiths, who \u201cknow that from then onwards whether the ingot survives being forged is a matter of luck\u201d\n\n[A freshly made crucible steel ingot, image credit Peter Burt](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zkm0z19a4e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c39855adc912f208268efe017e54de3cc3f55ae)\n\nThis is clear evidence that not only was the crucible steel production process being conducted in Bukhara in 1841, but that the mechanisms of pattern formation were already being formally investigated. And this is by far not the most recent ethnographic account of crucible steel manufacture.\n\nIn Mawalgaha, Sri Lanka, Ananda Coomaraswamy documented crucible steel production in 1903 \u2013 (Coomaraswamy, A. (1908): Medieval Sinhalese Art. Pantheon Books, New York, Juleff et al 2009). He found two crucible ingot fragments, crucibles, iron blooms and small iron bars. The two crucible ingot fragments were collected from the Mawalgaha village, where Kiri Ukkuwa demonstrated how to make steel for Coomaraswamy \u2013 providing the most recent known eyewitness evidence for crucible steel manufacturing.\n\nThis form of \"Damascus\" steel was therefore historically used as early as the 6th century BCE (Park et al 2019) and as late as 1841 when Massalski recorded crucible steel production in Bukhara, leading to the production of Bulat in Zlatoust by Anosov, and 1903 in Sri Lanka (though it was not actively being made en masse, and was only demonstrated using previously abandoned equipment).\n\n**In summary: Production between 1903ish, and 1980ish, was virtually halted, thus leading to the myth of it being a \"lost art\", however as will be shown in this document, the process was well documented and has since been replicated.**\n\nThe result is that there are now upwards of 150 individuals (at least, that I know of) who can produce crucible steel with an accurate metallurgical composition, which naturally form patterns in the steel due to carbide segregation. It is structurally, functionally and visually identical to historical crucible steel - and can only be differentiated by analysing the amount of radionuclides in the steel, as all historical steel is low background steel, and modern recreations are typically not.\n\nBecause I recognise that many people are visual learners, here is a comparison of antique crucible steel from an Iranian shamshir in my collection, and modern crucible steel (made by Niko Hynninen).\n\n[Left: Closeup of an antique Iranian shamshir blade in crucible steel.

The modern term \u201cwootz\u201d first appears around 1794 in writings by Sir Joseph Banks, who mistranslated Sanskrit for \u201cutsa\u201d as \u201cwootz\u201d (Dube, 2014). In the regions where crucible steel was made, and where it was forged into blades, it was not called \"damascus\". This name is primarily a medieval name, and primarily used in Europe.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Damascus\" steel is contentious - The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi) (circa 800 AD - 873 AD) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni) (circa 973 AD - 1048 AD) were both scholars who wrote about swords and steel made for swords, based on their surface appearance, geographical location of production or forging, or the name of the smith.\n\nThere are three potential sources for the term \"Damascus\" in the context of steel.\n\nThe word \"Damas\" stems from the root word for \"water\" (\"ma\") or \"broiling\" in Arabic (Sachse, 1994, 13) and Damascus blades are often described as exhibiting a water-pattern on their surface, and are referred to as \"watered steel\" not only in English but in other languages.\n\nThe second theory is geographical, as Al-Kindi called swords produced and forged in Damascus as Damascene (al-Hassan, 1978, 35) but it's worth noting that crucibl steel blades were made in many nations, and crucible steel is not known to have ever been produced in the city of Damascus. Al Kindi also describes crucible steel production using the typical term Pulad, distinct from these damascene swords, indicating that the two types are separate. It is also worth noting that Al-Kindi did not describe these swords as having pattern forming steel.\n\nThird, Beiruni mentions a sword-smith called Damasqui who made swords of crucible steel (Said, 1989, 219-220). In a similar fashion, Al-Kindi mentions swords called \u201cZaydiya which were forged by a man called Zayd, and hence they were attributed to his name\". We therefore have a precedent for naming swords based on their makers, which may explain how \"Damascus\" came about.\n\nIt is my opinion that the \"watered\" hypothesis is most likely for the origin, though the popularisation of the term may have indeed occurred due to western travellers who purchased the swords in damascus, and described them thusly, as it was a massive center for trade.\n\n**How Crucible steel gets its pattern:**\n\nCrucible steel, as the name implies, is made in a crucible process, and requires completely liquefication of the crucible charge.\n\nMost surviving \"recipes\" for crucible steel call for either a combination of bloomery iron, and cast iron, or the use of bloomery iron and organic carbon sources (like plant leaves) - but crucible steel recipes included other elements, like organic material - rice husks, leaves, bark - as well as shells, glass, and even silver. The trace impurities in the iron used, and in these additives, are key to the patterns they show after forging.\n\nIn order to form patterns, carbide forming alloying elements like vanadium, tungsten or manganese are necessary in small amounts, with vanadium being the most common historical alloying element. These carbide formers cause the segregation of hard cementite carbides, which form the \"white streaks\" in crucible steel.\n\nThe segregation of CFEs into interdendritic reasons is due to the differences in solidification temperature between high CFE and low CFE steel, with low CFE steel solidifying at a higher temperature than high CFE steel. This causes the low CFE steel to solidify first when the ingot is slowly cooled, and it does so by branching out into dendrities of relatively pure iron, while the impurities such as phosphorus, CFEs and sulfur get pushed into the regions between these branches.\n\n[Dendritic structures visible on freshly made crucible ingot - image credit Peter Burt.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4plho3o14e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5862b44b804955becc1428e59c7f6ad289ddfc0d)\n\nDuring the forging of the crucible steel \"puck\", these carbide formers are pushed into parallel, layered sheets in the microstructure of the steel (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\n[Parallel cluster sheets.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/gi70lojz3e591.gif)\n\nBecause vanadium and other CFEs do not readily dissolve at forging temperatures and do not rapidly migrate at forging temperatures, these sheets of carbide formers form distinct bands in the steel. As the steel is thermally cycled, carbides aggregate onto the CFEs via ostwald ripening, and form spheroids of cementite. The interdendritic regions without CFEs form as pearlite, a soft two-phase mixture of carbides, or sorbite, and imperfect form of pearlite. This is diagnostic of historical crucible steel (Verhoeven et al 2018, Feuerbach 2002, Feuerbach 2006).\n\nIt is worth noting that vanadium is not the only effective carbide former found in historical crucible steel blades, and other carbide formers like manganese are seen in historical examples - or even chromium as seen in Chahak, Iran (Alipour et al 2021). Additionally, the other microalloying elements in the steel can effect the contrast and spacing of the pattern, with phosporus notably increasing the contrast of the pattern after etching (Khorasani and Hynninen, 2013)\n\n**Historical perspectives on Crucible Damascus Steel quality:**\n\nRegarding the historical reputation of historical crucible steel swords: they were always very expensive, very desirable, and very well thought of - HOWEVER - there are accounts from the 14th century of cold-short blades (high in phosphorus) which claims that crucible steel swords are prone to breakage in cold weather.\n\nThe exact quote is by Ali\u0304 ibn \u02bbAbd al-Rah\u0323ma\u0304n Ibn Hudhayl, translated:\n\n>\"the Hindy sabre often breaks when the weather is cold and shows itself better when the weather is warm\u201d\n\nDespite this, they were very valued. Mohammad ibn Abi al-Barak\u0101t J\u014fhari Nez\u0101mi in 1196 CE states a good shamshir blade of crucible steel was valued at 100 golden Dinar (Khorasani et al, 2013).\n\nAl-Idrisi (Full name Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Idris al-Idrisi - circa 1100CE - 1166CE) claimed that \"*nothing could surpass*\" the edge of a crucible steel sword.\n\nBertrandon de la Brocquiere, a Frenchman, wrote about his travels to the Middle East in 1432CE\u20131433CE. He wrote:\n\n>\"Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria... I have nowhere seen swords cut so excellently. They are made at Damascus, and in the adjoining country.\"\n\nNote: This is potentially the source of the (incorrect but often repeated) claim that crucible steel swords were made in Damascus.\n\nIn the early 1600's, Polish king Zygmunt III Waza ordered a Armenian merchant (Sefer Muratowicz) to purchase a number of watered steel blades from Isfahan, Persia due to their value and reputation (Muratovich et al, 1777). On this same journey, the merchant purchased carpets embroidered with the royal coat of arms, which still survive today.\n\nRegardless of the reputation crucible steel enjoyed in its' day, the reality is that it was by nature very clean, with minimal slag - which made it less likely to break due to inclusions - and there is a lot of variation in the metallurgical composition of this steel. Some have higher carbon, or more phosphorus, and the quality varied. Heat treatment also widely varied.\n\nCompared to bloomery steel which was folded and consolidated, it's more uniform and much lower in slag - the term for non-metallic inclusions. The same is true of refined blast furnace steel, which also requires forge consolidation after finishing the finery process.\n\n[Microstructure of a Japanese Katana, 2% Nital etch. Note the presence slag inclusions (black) within the mostly martensitic steel.

It depends on the exact sword being analysed, as crucible steel was produced for around 2 millennia and in many places. For example, some accounts of crucible steel swords being able to be bent 90 degrees exist, however these can easily be countered with extant examples that take a set no matter the degree of bending.\n\n**Production methods:**\n\nHere are 4 different processes, which were recorded from at early as Al Kindi, to as late as 1841CE with Massalski - from the Deccani process used in Hyderabad, to the south Indian process, and the Isfahan process, and the Bukhara process.\n\nThere are more processes out there, I just haven't gotten around to writing them out.\n\n**Bukhara:**\n\n>3 parts clean iron, 1 part cast iron. Place in a crucible that is five times as tall as it the base is wide, with a mouth three times the size of the base. The weight of iron should be 2-2.5kg.  \n>  \n>Using a charcoal melting furnace with air venting holes, heat until melted (6 hours) or until a bubbling sound can be heard from the crucible. once bubbling stops, remove the lid of the crucible and add 0.013-0.017 grams of silver to the crucible and stir with a metal rod. reseal the crucible, seal all holes in the furnace, and allow to cool over 3 days.  \n>  \n>Remove the puck from the crucible, and polish one corner of it to check if the watered pattern is good. If the pattern is poor, reheat to a red heat and hold for seven minutes before allowing to cool in air.  \n>  \n>Forge into a bar using the top of the button to form the spine of the blade, and never heating above red.\n\n**South Indian:**\n\n>In a clay crucible of conical form (200mm height x 50mm diameter) add 250-500 grams of bloomery iron, as well as wood chips, rice husks, vines or leaves. Seal the crucible with a clay lid, leaving a vent hole. Allow to fully dry  \n>  \n>Using a bellow-fed charcoal forge, heat for 6 hours or until molten. allow the crucible to cool in the forge (some sources say to quench it in water).  \n>  \n>The button will have a striated appearance if everything was done correctly.\n\n**Deccani (Hyderabad) Process:**\n\n>Using a mixture of iron sand derived iron ore, and iron clay derived iron (mirtpalli and kondapur iron), place in a crucible with glass, sealed with clay with a vent hole. Place in a bellow powered charcoal furnace for 24 hours. The steel will melt within the first 3. After 24 hours, remove crucible and allow to cool in the air.  \n>  \n>Once cool, remove the buttons and cover each in clay, and anneal in a conventional forge for 12-16 hours. repeat this annealing process until the button is no longer brittle.\n\n**Isfahan Process:**\n\n>To a crucible, add 10% casi auriculata wood, and asclepias gigantean leaves with two parts pure iron, one part cast iron, and three parts silicate-rich iron ore up to a total weight of 200 grams.  \n>  \n>10-1200 of these small crucibles are heated at a time in a kiln operated with charcoal and bellows for 6 days, before the crucibles are broken open, and the buttons removed.  \n>  \n>The buttons are then transferred into a \"hot room\" to anneal and temper for 2 days so they do not shatter from cooling too quickly.\n\nAuthors note: I suspect that if this room is a furnace-heated compartment, and is hot enough, they also experience some level of rim decarburisation, as well as converting the microstructure of the puck to a more forgeable state compared to steel which has not been roasted.\n\n**\\*\\*References\\*\\***\n\nAlipour, R., Rehren, T., Martin\u00f3n-Torres, M. \"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia\", Journal of Archaeological Science, Vol. 127, 2021,\n\nAl-Hassan, A.Y., 1978, Iron and Steel Technology in Medieval Arabic Sources, Journal for the History of Arabic Science 2: 1,31-43\n\nAnosov, P.P.

To emphasize his sheer and incredible wealth, viewers  are shown his special vault for gold coins. There are so many of these  coins that McDuck literally bathes in this money.\n\nThey  created the cartoon successfully used the recognizable image of wealth  in modern culture and brought it to the absolute. However, we see  similar pictures of bags or suitcases filled with cash in feature films  and the news.\n\nWe perceive the image of money as an image, as a symbol of wealth and opportunities.\n\nHowever,  the task of quickly and clearly conveying to the viewer or reader a  certain analogue of gold coins or banknotes corresponding to the place  and time was also in antiquity.\n\nAbout  five thousand years ago, in southern Mesopotamia, Sumerian craftsmen  had to solve a similar problem. They thought like us and perceived  wealth as an opportunity to go beyond their minimum needs. At the same  time, wealth for the Sumerians is to live in a world without hunger, it  is to have constant guaranteed access to a variety of food.\n\nThe  diet of a common inhabitant of Lagash or Ur consisted of cereal cakes,  boiled grains, onions, onions, and sometimes dates. The blackheads (as  the Sumerians called themselves) received vegetable oil or meat on  holidays and in connection with special events.\n\nTherefore,  it was livestock that was a symbol of wealth and prosperity for the  ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia. Fat herds were the subject of trade,  an offering for deities and trophies in the bloody wars between the  Sumerian city-states (nomes).\n\nThere  is no doubt that it was grain that was the basis of the entire Sumerian  civilization. Grain made it possible to feed the peasants, artisans,  warriors, merchants, priests and rulers. Not only to feed, but also to  allow the maintenance of many people who are not employed in the  household. These people invented accounting, bureaucracy, and many still  useful inventions. But with all this, in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the  goddess Inanna seduced the mighty hero Gilgamesh with the words:\n\n*Let the sovereigns, kings and lords bow their knees,*\n\n*May they bring you tribute from the hills and the plains,*\n\n*Your goats give birth to triplets, and your sheep give birth to twins,*\n\n*Let your pack donkey overtake the mule.*\n\nWe can see a similar idea of \u200b\u200bwealth in ancient Sumerian artifacts:\n\n[Door decoration, fragment | Middle East, southern Mesopotamia, Lagash region, Girsu settlement | Ancient Sumer | Bronze Age, Early Dynastic III, 2700-2500 BC | from the Barakat Galleries collection](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1y0ot4u6je591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79f30e22d828262ff617de5d0cada6583746ed76)\n\n[Limestone and bitumen relief, fragment of wall decoration in Ninhursag temple | Middle East, southern Mesopotamia, Tell el-Ubeid (near the settlement of Ur) | Ancient Sumer | Bronze Age, Early Dynastic III, c. 2500 BC | British Museum, London](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3nwx075aje591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5509d8599cefc85449d1e3c35405ecf10b9dbdae)\n\n[Vase from Warka \/ Vase from Uruk, fragment | Near East, Mesopotamia, settlement of Uruk | Early Bronze Age, Jemdet Nasr period, 3000-2900 AD BC. | Sumerian Gallery of the Iraqi Museum in Baghdad, Republic of Iraq | photo Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y7mmeljeje591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1bc4d0d92262ab660794cd9cce249e49bada5ac)\n\n[\u201cStandart from Ur\u201d, side of the world, fragment | Near East, southern Mesopotamia, site of Ur, Royal Tomb PG779 | Ancient Sumer | Bronze Age, Early Dynastic III, circa 2500 B.C. | from the collection of the British Museum](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bc8kzcdije591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dd6286a807000b50839179bbb0aad37921ecc19)\n\n \n\nThis is not to say that the ancient  image of fat fields with grazing cattle is completely outdated, but for  most of us it is not relevant. Ownership in ancient Sumer is a debatable  issue, but most historians agree that most of the wealth was in some  form of collective community ownership (at least formally).\n\nThis  means that, looking at the string of cows on the sculptural frieze of  the local temple, the Sumerians felt their involvement in the general  wealth and prosperity of their city.\n\n**I want to wish you that your health triples and your wealth doubles (whatever it is measured in)!**","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1655240911.0},{"title":"Nalanda: India's ancient university rising from the ashes","author":"MeatballDom","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/reel\/video\/p0ccrdsh\/nalanda-india-s-ancient-university-rising-from-the-ashes","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1655005191.0},{"title":"Are there any examples of Retroactive Nomenclature except Byzantium?","author":"DisCombombulate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/vajf0l\/are_there_any_examples_of_retroactive\/","text":"Byzantium was a name given to the Eastern Roman Empire by later historians, while the Byzantines themselves didn't call themselves that.

Johnson a failure on foreign policy?","author":"Any-Satisfaction-770","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/v9q8hz\/why_do_historians_consider_lyndon_b_johnson_a\/","text":"The most obvious case is his handling of the Vietnam war. I read that Kennedy was actually going to pull troops out, but when Johnson took office he kept them in. Johnson was responding to popular opinion at the time where in 1964 there was still clear support for the war. Of course it wouldn't be proper to mention Johnson's foreign policy without his Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Johnson and McNamara were responsible for a massive increase in troop levels by the time mid 1965 rolled around. This was in spite of the fact that the bombing campaigns had proven unsuccessful in the north. By late 1965 even more troops were being sent in against the poor results on the ground. It's true that Johnson was in a bind considering that not sending troops would be to admit defeat. \n\nBy 1966, Americans were getting impatient with the war and Johnson's approval rating had dropped. Johnson was getting anxious for a decisive victory, but the bombing campaigns weren't doing it. Johnson had fleeting moments of positive press like the Manila conference, but they didn't last. During this time Johnson and McNamara were continuing to send more troops into Vietnam. It got even stranger when they were technically in secret talks with the north and still commenced bombing. In 1967, the war was clearly unpopular. The death toll was getting larger. Over 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded by that point. McNamara by this stage had actually recommended a cap on troop sizes that Johnson was against. McNamara ended up resigning. Johnson was paranoid by this point. The FBI and CIA were targeting anti-war activists and Johnson even believed these people to be part of a communist conspiracy. The animosity to Johnson was so strong by this point that he couldn't even speak at the Democratic Convention in 1968. It was so bad that it was a reason he didn't seek his parties nomination in 1968. Johnson did try peace talks by this point, but were not substantial. Nixon himself offered far better terms in the talks effectively making Johnson a lame duck. \n\nSo why do historians consider Lyndon B. Johnson a failure on foreign policy? This blemish on his record explains a lot.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1654923675.0},{"title":"Shipwreck The Gloucester hailed most important since Mary Rose","author":"Electrical-Cow-5147","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-norfolk-61734192","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1654858585.0},{"title":"The Anti-Lee: George Henry Thomas, Southerner in Blue \u2013 Emerging Civil War","author":"Morganbanefort","url":"https:\/\/emergingcivilwar.com\/2021\/09\/02\/the-anti-lee-george-henry-thomas-southerner-in-blue\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1654824288.0},{"title":"When Jawaharlal Nehru read \u2018Lolita\u2019 to decide whether an \u2018obscene\u2019 book should be allowed in India","author":"l_hazlewoods","url":"https:\/\/scroll.in\/article\/1024765\/when-jawaharlal-nehru-read-lolita-to-decide-whether-an-obscene-book-should-be-allowed-in-india","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1654883925.0},{"title":"The Roman emperor who tried to make his horse consul","author":"soulpost","url":"http:\/\/www.psysecrets.info\/2022\/06\/the-roman-emperor-who-tried-to-make-his.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1654867775.0},{"title":"D-Day ration pack last in the world, Dorset museum says","author":"Electrical-Cow-5147","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-dorset-61729444","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1654700511.0},{"title":"Bookclub Wednesday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/v7mv5k\/bookclub_wednesday\/","text":" Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics.

It was previously thought that the speech took place in the beginning of 1950, which was months before the event took place Maple Shade, but we now know that it happened months after the Maple Shade events fizzled out.\n\nKing had been searching for \"months\" due to the events in Maple Shade not panning out the way he had planned, so he needed a new method, one that would be effective for the social change he was trying to effect, which is exactly where the speech my Mordecai Johnson fit in.  We now finally have a date, place and time that we can celebrate the speech that brought Dr. King to nonviolence, all from a high school drop out.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1654038837.0},{"title":"History of Jammu district Reasi","author":"SeriousEase2098","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/VrcGpjCMabs","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1653992801.0},{"title":"How did fashion\/clothing really change through the medieval ages and early modern period?","author":"Uncle_Price","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/v0af5h\/how_did_fashionclothing_really_change_through_the\/","text":"Through history fashion changed every decade, but I wonder.

Not only is it an interesting little tidbit of history, but it has so many intersections of topics, struggles, and themes that it becomes even more relevant for study.\n\n**Background\/reasons\/context**\n\nThe Inca were the first to use guano, hundreds of years before the Europeans discovered how useful a substance bird\/bat poop is. Guano\u2019s use as a fertilizer was so important to the Incas that they even had mythology surrounding the islands. Much of this was documented by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the descendant of an Incan and a Spanish conquistador. De la Vega even noted down the strict laws that surrounded the Guano Islands:\n\n* Going to the guano islands during mating season was punishable by death\n* Killing the seabirds of the guano islands anytime of the year was punishable by death\n* Each Incan province was assigned a guano island where every village and householder would get a part equal to the amount they would need. This was to end the privatization of the guano.\n\nThe initial Europeans in the region focused more on finding gold than in discovering why the natives like bird poop so much. It wasn\u2019t until Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian geographer, who had taken samples of guano back to Europe with him to give to Pourcroy and Vanquelin. These Parsian chemists there realized that guano was very rich in nitrogen and was an excellent fertilizer. However it wasn\u2019t popularly used as a fertilizer until Mr. Skinner, the editor of American Farmer, sent out samples of guano in the states in 1824. Europe didn\u2019t get to try it until 1840, when England received 20 barrels of guano.\n\nEurope and the United States were faced with depleting topsoil. There was a large demand for effective fertilizer, with people buying into recommendations of using human pee and sawdust. However, none of these were as good as guano. It was such an effective fertilizer that the size of the crops grown with it feared many farmers. Regardless, the age of Guano had arrived.\n\n**Labor**\n\nGuano harvesting was physically demanding. So, like in many other situations where someone with capital deems it necessary for a strenuous task to be performed, someone ends up getting exploited for labor. Slaves were made of the Chinese, Polynesian, and Easter Islanders to harvest the guano. Many were kidnapped, and the adult populations of many of these islands were severely reduced. The labor was tough. Guano dust was rampant, causing people to choke and develop respiratory issues. The guano islands had no natural anchorage, meaning that the enslaved miners had to paddle boats to the ships. The water had sharks and was turbulent. There were minimal drinkable water sources.  Rats got into the food supplies and would bite workers. The conditions were so bad that guards had to be placed around the shores so the slaves would not commit suicide.\n\n**Leading up to the Guano Islands Act of 1856**\n\nJournalists reported on the labor issues occurring in the Guano Islands with sensational stories. The labor issues occurring in the guano islands also brought the public's attention to the Peruvian monopoly on Guano and the trade deal they had with the British. There was an anxiety over the limited amount of guano in Europe and the Americas. Peru was able to claim a monopoly and worked out a trade deal with Britain. Americans did not like this. President Millard Fillmore addressed this issue in his State of the Union address in 1850, stating that \u201cPeruvian guano has become so desirable an article to the agricultural interest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government to employ all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing that article to be imported into the country at a reasonable price.\u201d Congress passed the Guano Islands Act in 1856.\n\n**Analyzation of the act itself: the language and the implications of it**\n\nThe act itself has a lot of very interesting language that have had many serious implications.\n\n* The first is that the act declared that the president could direct the navy to protect claims to guano islands.\n* It also declared that, \u201cNothing in this chapter contained shall be construed as obliging the United States to retain possession.\u201d There was no intention of incorporating these territories.\n\n**How the Guano Islands Act shaped the modern world**\n\nAlong with the other technological advancements that were concurrently occurring, the guano boom greatly contributed to the creation of the modern agroindustrial complex. The standard of living doubled as a result of the increased amount of food available.\n\nThe Guano Islands Act is also the first act of US imperialism and kickstarter America\u2019s imperialist adventures. It was the first time territorial expansion was done not on the mainland and it was the first time that the expansion had no intention of incorporation as well. It set a precedent that wasn\u2019t legally solidified until the Navassa Revolt and the following Jones v US (1890). I\u2019m not going to get too much into that because while it is very interesting, it is a lot of legal jargon that I don\u2019t have the time to read through and decipher to write here. I would still recommend looking into it because it A brief summary is that Haiti and the US both wanted Navassa and both claimed it as theirs. The US allowed the claim because it did not recognize the Haitian government at the time. Slaves at the island revolted against their enslavers, 4 of them were killed. 43 of the enslaved workers were charged with crimes in Jones v US. A lot went down in that trial, with Jones\u2019s lawyer questioning the constitutionality of the guano island act and if the US government had jurisdiction over Navassa. The court\u2019s ruling set the legal precedent for US court jurisdiction over future imperial holdings.\n\n**What the Act connects (concepts, ideas, patterns, etc)**\n\nThe Guano Boom is a truly interesting phenomena, as I previously stated, because of the multitude of intersections between so many events, concepts, and greater historical themes. There are many, but I\u2019ll briefly touch on some of them here\n\n1. California Gold Rush\n\nMany people migrated to California during the gold rush, and many of them used ships to get there. It was a very long journey since the Panama Canal was not yet built. The ship owners made a lot of money transporting people there, but no one wanted to go back home from California. Not wanting to have empty ships return, they realized that they picked up guano on their way back. The Guano trade wasn\u2019t quite yet a boom, but the gold rush has made it into a boom.\n\n1. Communism\n\nKarl Marx\u2019s Metabolic Rift was written during England\u2019s second agricultural revolution. It was during this time that guano was in high demand because of its effectiveness as a fertilizer. Marx noticed the threat that soil depletion posed to capitalist society and had led to powers to imperialize sources of guano. Here he acknowledges not only the capitalist robbing the worker, but the soil as well. Marx also had a lot to say on the inhuman conditions the enslaved miners were faced with. I would also look into Liebig for more information.\n\n1. Economic Booms\n\nPeru benefited economically as a result of the Guano Boom. In 1853, Peru was able to be debt free through paying off their debts through the money made by the boom. The federal budget was tripled in 1860. 15 years of a guano boom had generated $150 million in revenue. This wealth created a construction boom in Peru as infrastructure was planned and built. The Guano boom unfortunately became a bust and the Peruvian economy greatly suffered as a result of this.\n\nDisclaimer: This post is for a class assignment for my US History class.

I knew only that they had won their freedom through the slave revolt, and had no idea that France came back later with new warships to demand ransom as \"reparations\" to the former slave-holders, which lasted for generations. As the debts (actually a double-debt, as France offered them a usurious loan to \"help\" them pay their debt) finally neared a close, France then locked Haiti's national bank into a system where they could syphon money off of every transaction back to France, making it impossible to build the country.\n\nThen an American bank, which would later become Citigroup, muscled its way in, buying up a controlling share of the national bank, and continuing the process of syphoning money out of every Haitian transaction. A few years later, that bank was one of the main instigators of the United State's occupation of Haiti, where more wealth was extracted.\n\nThis series was eye-opening for me, and well done (although it is one of those Times articles with funky scrolling to show you different images and documents as you scroll, which isn't for everyone but I thought it worked pretty well here.

It doubled in size after WW1, and 16,500 sq miles after WW2.\n\nWhat's debatable (through solid efforts of Romanian diplomacy) is who's side was Romania on in each war and did it actually lose in each of them.\u00a0\n\nIn WW1, Romania delayed entering the war for 2 years and negotiated extensively with both sides. After being forced, through an ultimatum, Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary. Over the next few months, Central Powers forces occupied nearly 2\/3 of Romania's territory, prompting Romanian-German negotiations, which resulted in the Treaty of Bucharest (1918). The treaty respected Romania's independence required Romania's assistance to Central Powers in the war and\u00a0awarded Romania more territory (what an interesting way to lose)\u00a0through the union with Bessarabia. Despite the treaty being de facto active, and its terms being followed, Romanian king Ferdinand delayed the royal ratification.\n\nThe day, before WW1 ended, Romania re-declared the war on Central Powers, formally retaining the status of an ally of the Entente. But was it?\n\nDuring the Paris Peace Conference of 1919\u20131920 that followed, Romania\u00a0**gained 60,000 square miles of land and 8,500,000 inhabitants**.\n\nIn WW2, despite being an active Axis participant, and being named a defeated side in the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, Romania had **Northern Transylvania (16,643 sq miles and a population of 2,577,260 before the war) recognized as its integral part**.\n\n\n\n**!!! Clarification:**\nI specifically wanted to compare its territories right before, and after joining the war. Because, if we start looking at what happened before\/between the wars, the territorial disputes can be traced way back to Balkan Wars, then to 19th century, etc.\n\nRomania did lose a large portion of its territories in 1940 (Molotov ultimatum of 1940, Second Vienna Award, Treaty of Craiova), but was NOT involved in WW2 at the time, thus making it an interwar diplomatic issue.\n\nI look specifically at:\n1. \u201cwhat did Romania have at the moment of declaring war in WW1\/2?\u201d \n2. \u201cwhat did Romania gain as a direct result of treaties signed after the war?\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1653289890.0},{"title":"Examination of Battles Featuring Extreme Examples of \"Mother Nature\"","author":"StepAsideButch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/uwe1jm\/examination_of_battles_featuring_extreme_examples\/","text":"We have to keep in mind that there is no such thing as an EASY battle.

A relieved city accepted. \n\nShe then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulfur wrapped in cloth to each bird, set the sulfur on fire, and release the birds. The birds returned to their homes and set the city on fire everywhere at once, so the flames could not be put out. Olga\u2019s army killed or captured all who escaped the flames, and her revenge was complete.\n\nDespite her bloody history as regent for her son, Olga became a saint by converting to Christianity and doing what she could to convince her son and people to convert as well. Her son refused but after her death her grandson agreed and the Kievan Rus became Christian. Saint Olga is a patron of widows and converts. \n\nSome call her the patron saint of vengeance, but that appears to be an unofficial title since vengeance isn\u2019t really in keeping with Christian teachings. Nevertheless, her legend lives on.\n\nIn the movie *The Northman* there\u2019s a broad hint that the main character\u2019s daughter will be Saint Olga, a rare woman on the tree of kings. Saint Olga was said to be of Viking origin.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olga_of_Kiev","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1653224375.0},{"title":"Good or Bad? The Impacts Of WW1 On Canada","author":"CompetitiveTea6189","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/uw6lsk\/good_or_bad_the_impacts_of_ww1_on_canada\/","text":" \n\nThe First World War had a mostly negative impact on Canada because of declines in the agricultural sector and poor treatment of non-Western European people in Canada. The war to end all wars led to the plunge of the farming sector in Canada, and factories had a prominent role to play in this. Non-Western Europeans were not liked in Canada, and the great war turned hatred against them into paranoia, which led to their poor treatment. The great war had a positive impact too, like the recognition of the contributions made by women during the war.\n\nThe great war hurt Canada because it led to the agricultural sector's decline in Canada. More and more factories were being built, and the factories of the Imperial Munitions Board employed 250,000 men and 50,000 women. A historian named William Young said in the article, \"After the fighting, a nation changed,\" \"The high wages paid by the new munitions factories seemed to exercise an almost irresistible attraction for the comparatively underpaid agricultural laborer's who flooded to the cities to work.\" Prime Minister Borden allowed farmers' sons to be exempt from conscription, but this promise was broken, further worsening the employment crisis in the agricultural sector. This led to less agricultural production, which put the sector into a decline. A vital component of war was now in short supply.\n\nNon-Western Europeans were not liked in Canada, and World War I caused hatred for them to skyrocket. German speakers, people from the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Ukrainians were thought to be disloyal to Canada. This hatred only escalated when a lot of people faced internment because of their ethnicity. In May of 1919, there was a huge strike in Winnipeg, which increased paranoia and made it seem that capitalism and good order were under attack. This made Canada have fear and unrest as the nation was getting so divided, that ethnicities were getting spied on for fear of rebellion similar to Russia\u2019s 1917 Bolshevik revolution.\n\nThe way women contributed to Canada allowed them to get rights after the war had ended. Before the war, women were housewives while men were the workers, but when the war came, though they had lower wages than men, they filled the positions of men. This allowed women to show their abilities and since this was a major change, it attracted the government\u2019s attention. Women were seen more in the workplace, though later on in the war the amount of women in the workplace returned to pre war levels. In 1917, during the Canadian elections, women, especially those that had relatives on the front, were allowed to vote. Even though it was a political move, this eventually led to the permanent right for all women to vote in 1918. These contributions led to the government recognizing women's efforts, paving the way for the call for more women's rights.\n\nWorld War I had a bad impact on Canada because of the decline of the agricultural sector and more hatred against non-Western European people in Canada. Hatred and agricultural insecurity resulted in a slew of setbacks for Canada. There were some positive impacts too, and one that I have talked about is the increase in rights for women. World war one had a lot of positives. The positives of World War one show that, there are many negatives to World War one, but sometimes great sacrifices yield future gains. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about the impact of World War 1 on Canada?

She offers a passage written by Eustathios of Thessalonica, where he writes \"God calls us all sons, yet we dare to debase our brothers in the level of slaves\", which she claims was written to the Roman Emperor Manuel Komnenos, who had issued legal guarantees for the personal liberties of the Byzantines.\n\nNow, there are some contemporary statements from the time period which might be what she is referring to, but do not exactly speak of a widespread abolition of slavery. For example, in \u201cSlavery in the Black Sea Region, c.900\u20131900: Forms of Unfreedom at the Intersection between Christianity and Islam\u201d by Felicia Ro\u015fu we read that Eustathios of Thessalonica praised the Roman Emperor Manuel Komnenos in a funeral oration for manumitting all the slaves in the Capital (New Rome), including all those who came from beyond the Danube and the native slaves of the Pontic Steppe (today\u2019s Ukraine and South Russia). Moving on, in \u201cLiberty: Ancient Ideas and Modern Perspectives\u201d by Valentina Arena, we are described how elsewhere that Ioannes Kinnamos wrote about how Manuel Komnenos also abolished a form of wage-slavery entered into by citizens because \u201che wanted to rule over free Romans and not slaves\u201d.\n\nMy questioning here is the following: Did the Medieval Romans really abolish slavery? Was there a strong Roman Greek abolitionist movement, which resulted in abolition, or at least the developments described above? Did they briefly abolish slavery but later re-institute it like France? Perhaps such a re-institution was caused by the expansion of Western European slavery in the Eastern Mediterranean, through the proto-colonies that were the Crusade States (Kingdom of Jerusalem, Duchy of Antioch, Duchy of Edessa, Empire of Romania, Empire of Thessalonica etc.) and the Trade Empires (Pisa, Genoa, Venice), who engaged in extensive slave trade?","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1651790477.0},{"title":"The discovery of the largest Nazi treasure hoard of World War II in the abandoned mine near Merkers in Germany.

The British diverting Allied resources in a futile attempt to defend British imperial interests and that the allies would have been far better off attacking mainland Europe earlier and ignoring the Med. Which may have allowed the Western Allies to beat the Russians to Berlin.\n\nTo me, however, that view is based on 20\/20 hindsight. The reality was, that before the second battle El Alamein, the allied armies had consistently struggled when facing German ground forces. In hindsight we know that the British forces had a logistical advantage that made a German victory improbable but that isn't how it seemed at the time. With the British army being consistently being driven back and suffering defeats at the hands of the Germans.\n\nThis wasn't just a problem faced by the British. The Americans were routed at Kasserine Pass and were driven back. A common occurrence when green troops, with inexperience commanders, met veterans. \n\nMy point is, the Allied armies had an inferiority complex when facing the Germans and struggled to effectively implement combined warfare. North Africa and the Med may have been a strategic backwater but it was vital for the allies to gain both the experience and the confidence that they could defeat the German army. In hindsight we know that the German war machine was far from invincible but that was not obvious in 1942. \n\nI doubt that an earlier focus on mainland Europe would have been wise.

I first heard about this battle a  few years ago on some corner of the internet and tried to do some  research on it but all I could uncover was a stub of a Wikipedia  article, a few 2-3min pop history videos on YouTube and a short Russian  movie about it. No primary or real scholarly source.\n\nI  offhandedly mentioned this to a Russian friend of mine and after some  digging she told me that its actually not too well known in Russia  either. She had found a few people talking about it on Russian history  blogs but information was scarce, apparently information on the battle  had been surprised following the Russian Revolution on account of it  being the heroics of a Tsarist army. All the Russian history blogs  pointed to one book, printed in 1917, just before the Russian  Revolution. Its seemingly extremely rare with only a few Russian  libraries having copies.\n\nFast-forward  a few months and on my birthday she presents me with a translation of  the text (specifically the account of Osowiec) that she had spent moths  translating to create the first and only copy of this account in  English.\n\nI know she worked as a translator and interpreter for the UN for a while so I trust her work\n\nI have copied it from a pdf  so if there are any issues or typos, its probably because of that\n\nWithout further ado, here it is in full.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Preface from the translator\n\nThis is a translation of an extract from the book called \u201cThe Defense of the Fortress\n\nOsovets\u201d. The book describes the second attack on the fortress Osovets by the German troops\n\nin WW1. The second attack started in January 1915 and lasted for 6.5 months where the first 6\n\nmonths and some days were devoted to mutual cannon fire. The first 40 pages or so of the book\n\ndescribe the terrain, the available weapons and the cannon fire in minute detail. I skipped those\n\npages and translated only the part that is about the famous poison gas attack made by the\n\nGermans against the defenders of the fortress Osovets.\n\nThe authors of the book, officers Sveshnikov and Bunyakovsky, were in the fortress Osovets\n\nat the time and took part in the described events. The book was published in 1917 before the\n\nRussian revolution. Due to that fact, the authors are using the old-timey pre-revolution Russian\n\nwhich differs in several ways from the modern Russian instilled by the Communist party after\n\n1917 and possesses a sort of special lilting, long-winded charm which I tried to preserve (not\n\nsure how successful I was). I also preserved the italicization of the original text.\n\nThe book was written with the intention of being used by military historians interested in this\n\nperiod and as such it is not nearly as dramatic in the description of the gas attack as later\n\nretellings; in fact, it was only called \u201cthe attack of the dead men\u201d much later for the purposes of\n\namping up the drama. It is, however, the most accurate and detailed (and, to my knowledge,\n\nmore or less the only one) witness account that has survived over the century that has passed\n\nsince. The book in its physical form is only available in one or two of the biggest libraries in\n\nRussia, most copies having been lost or destroyed, and fans of military history are sharing it\n\nwith each other as a pdf in their blogs.\n\nAlso, the book contains a large number of illustrations, such as military maps and weapon\n\nschematics. I translated one such map covering the general area around Osovets in Photoshop\n\nfor you to have a clearer picture of what is going on and where everything is happening.\n\nHope you enjoy this text. Happy birthday!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Picture #3. The development of the fortress Osovets.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Z8RygDj)\n\nThe Gas Attack of July 24 th\n\nOn the 24 th of July our troops at the Sosnenskaya theatre of operations (TO) were situated as\n\nfollows:\n\nThe right flank of the Sosnenskaya TO by the village of Belogrondy was occupied by three\n\nsquadrons (the 1 st squadron of the Zemlyansky regiment and 2 squadrons of militia men). Their\n\ntask was to cover the first \u2013 the main \u2013 area of the Sosnenkaya TO from the right and cover the\n\nZarechny fort from the north side using the second road leading to the Zarechny fort via the\n\nBudnensky bridge.\n\nThe centre of the Sosnenskaya TO and the left flank between the Rudsky channel and the\n\nSosnya village were occupied by 1.5 battalions (including 1 battalion of the Zemlyansky\n\nregiment and 2 squadrons of militia men), situated in the following manner:\n\nThe first area of the Sosnenskaya TO along the railroad, as well as the Leonovo community,\n\nwas occupied by one squadron (number 10); they had a partial support from half a squadron of\n\nmilitia men. These troops covered a most important way along the railroad and the Rudsky\n\nchannel towards the Zarechny fort.\n\nThe second area was occupied by one squadron (number 9) which was also supported by\n\nhalf a squadron of militia men.\n\nThe third and fourth areas were also occupied by one squadron each (the 12 th and 11 th\n\nsquadrons of the Zemlyansky regiment).\n\nOne squadron of militia men was situated by the forest ranger\u2019s house, in reserve of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO.\n\nIn view of this, the whole of the Sosnenskaya TO up to the village of Belogrondy was\n\noccupied only by nine squadrons (three of them consisting of militia men). In order to strengthen\n\nthe reserves of the Sosnenskaya TO, same as every day during this period of defence, one\n\nmore battalion of the Zemlyansky regiment was sent from the Zarechny fort on the night from\n\nthe 23 rd to the 24 th , however, just before dawn, around 3 AM, this battalion returned to the\n\nZarechny fort as usual to rest after their night watch. Due to the small numbers of the garrison, it\n\nwas not possible to leave a lot of troops at the Sosnenskaya TO.\n\nAgainst our 1.5 battalions the Germans brought about 12 battalions of the 11 th Landwehr\n\ndivision and besides that, according to the accounts of captives, about 6 battalions were kept in\n\nreserve.\n\nAgainst the village of Belogrondy the Germans sent the 5 th Landwehr regiment together with\n\nthe 41 st ersatz-reserve battalion. Their task, it seems, was to break through our defence in\n\nBelogrondy and furthermore to take over the Zarechny fort from the north side.\n\nAgainst the first and second areas the Germans sent the 18 th Landwehr regiment together\n\nwith the 147 th ersatz-reserve battalion whose mission was to break through the center of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO cutting off the left flank troops and making them retreat to the marshes, as\n\nwell as attacking the Zarechnaya TO via the Rudsky bridge.\n\nThe 76 th Landwehr regiment was tasked with taking over the village of Sosnya and then\n\nadvancing towards the forest ranger\u2019s house in order to act against the left flank troops of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO. These infantry troops were strengthened by the 1 st combat engineer battalion\n\nand parts of the 36 th combat engineer battalion.\n\nThe 75 th Landwehr regiment was advancing along the railroad staying in reserve. Apart from\n\nthe 14 battalions listed above, according to the words of captives 2 more regiments (numbers\n\nunknown) were also in the reserve of the attackers.\n\nDuring recent preparations for an attack, over 30 gas batteries (several thousands of gas\n\ncylinders) were delivered and installed in 4 places in front of the enemy trenches, 6-7 batteries\n\nper installment. According to the captives, the batteries had been stealthily installed\n\napproximately 13 days before the attack and during this period of time the enemy was waiting\n\nfor the most convenient atmospheric conditions in order for the poison gas to be at its most\n\ndevastating.\n\nThe Release of the Gas and Its Impact\n\nAt 4 AM on the 24 th of July the gas was released. It was of a dark green colour. The exact\n\nrecipe of it, having chlorine in its base, was hard to determine, however, there was undoubtedly\n\nsome other addition that intensified the choking effect.\n\nThe dense cloud of gas reached our trenches after only 5-10 minutes. It was heading\n\ntowards the fortress fast, having a high starting speed and expanding to the sides (its initial size\n\nwas no more than 2 versts \\[a verst = 1.0668 kilometres\\]) and up.\n\nThe impact of the gas cloud was such that, on the one hand, it created a cover hiding the\n\nmovements of the enemy, and on the other hand, it brought lethal poisoning to everything it\n\ntouched. The first victims of the poisoned fumes were scout parties and secret sentries who all\n\ndied. Despite the measures taken, such as burning tow and hay in front of the trenches, pouring\n\nand spraying of lime white and wearing respirators, almost all defenders of the 1 st , the 2 nd , the\n\n4 th and half of the 3 rd area of the Sosnenskaya TO were poisoned by the choking gas to death.\n\nHalf of the people in the reserve of the Sosnenskaya TO were also poisoned. The expansion\n\nof the gas forward measured almost 20 versts, with the height of the cloud being 5-6 sazhen \\[a\n\nsazhen = 2.1336 m\\], but the devastating impact of the gas was notable up to 12 versts after\n\nwhich its influence weakened greatly.\n\nAlong with the lethal assault on our front troops, the poison of the gas also overwhelmed the\n\nmajority of the defenders of the fortress, getting into even tightly closed rooms. All flora over\n\nmore than 12 versts was burned by the gas.\n\nThe garrison took all of the recommended measures against the gas but it turned out that the\n\nanti-gas masks available at the time only helped against the gas very little due to the small size\n\nof their neutralizing area and possibly due to the fact that using them in combat was incredibly\n\ndifficult as it was hard to tie them on and keep them fitted tight to the skin; it was especially a\n\nchallenge for the officers who, while commanding the soldiers, had to take the masks off or lift\n\nthem up temporarily. The strength of the gas was partly diminished by the conditions of the\n\nclimate and local geography: the morning of the 24 th was cold, foggy and damp, and after\n\nhaving passed over the wet marshes, the river and the moats the gas was considerably\n\nweakened which saved the garrison from enormous losses.\n\nThe actions of the attacking parties\n\nAfter the release of the gas, the enemy instantly sent up red flares everywhere, signaling that\n\nthe gas had been released and the movement of the troops for frontal assault could now begin.\n\nAfter the flares all German batteries opened heavy fire equally at all areas of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO, especially at the village of Osovets seeing as the Germans were afraid of us\n\nattacking the advancing enemy flanks from there; the fire also covered the only road leading\n\nfrom the reserve of the Sosnenskaya TO via the Rudsky channel to the Zarechny fort which was\n\nthe only place capable of sending reinforcements to Sosnya, and lastly they fired at the\n\nZarechny fort, the Zarechnaya TO, the other forts and the base area, and meanwhile the\n\nartillery shells were also filled with a concoction that, at the explosion of the shells, created\n\nclouds of choking gas.\n\nUnder the cover of the artillery fire and choking gas the infantry started their assault.\n\nThe attackers\u2019 plan was of two parts: the first one \u2013 sending scouts ahead to investigate the\n\nimpact of the gas on the defenders of the trenches, and the second one \u2013 storming the TO.\n\nThe scouts were assigned, numbering 200 people from each regiment, and the main\n\nattacking forces moved in two lines, keeping their ranks closed and having the reserves behind\n\nthem.\n\nAt first the Germans attacked the first area of the Sosnenskaya TO which they were the\n\nclosest to before July 24 th ; besides, a frontal attack may have been more difficult for the\n\nGermans but in case of success they would have cut off the centre and the left flank of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO while pushing the troops occupying those areas out into the marshes and\n\nseparating the Sosnenskaya and Belogrondskaya TOs.\n\nBy this time in the first area only two soldiers with machine guns were left alive. They wanted\n\nto open fire at the advancing Germans but were so weakened by the gas that they were not\n\nable to do it; then they dismantled the machine guns and buried the parts right there in the sand\n\nnearby and they themselves died right there, in the machine-gun nest.\n\nHaving quickly cut about 10 passages through the three lines of wire fences in front of the\n\nfirst area, the Germans flooded the area and went further on both sides of the railroad. The\n\nextremely heavy fire opened at that moment by our artillery made most of the Germans scatter\n\nand only some parts of the 18 th Landwehr regiment broke through and reached the trenches of\n\nthe reserves of the Sosnenskaya TO.\n\nContinuing the frontal assault, they managed to reach the second area where the majority of\n\ndefenders had also succumbed to the gas. From there a part of their forces made their way to\n\nthe flank of the third area and another part continued advancing towards the reserves.\n\nAt the same time the 76 th Landwehr regiment, having gathered in the forest to the west and\n\nsouth-west of the village of Sosnya and having lost approximately a thousand of their people to\n\ntheir own gas which had crept towards the west as they approached the fortress, attacked the\n\nvillage of Sosnya where very few remained alive by then. After crushing the skulls of 36 dead\n\nmen , a part of the enemy forces moved from there towards the flank and the rear of the third\n\narea. In the meantime one of the fortress machine gunners took his machine gun with him,\n\nmoved away from the village of Sosnya and, having situated himself between the village of\n\nSosnya and the third area, began shooting the Germans surrounding him at point-blank range.\n\nHe managed to spend 2 ammunition belts but when he was inserting the third one into the gun,\n\nthe Germans used the break, attacked him and tore him to pieces; only his forehead was left\n\nintact.\n\nAfter that the Germans moved to the third area, surrounded it and attacked it from three\n\nsides but could not take it because the defenders continued to fight them off stubbornly with rifle\n\nand machine gun fire.\n\nAt that time the Germans who had been advancing from the first and the second areas\n\nreached the trenches of the reserve and started climbing the wire fences. Their advancement\n\nhad cut off Belogrondy as they had passed the spot with the only bridge connecting the\n\nBelogrondskaya TO with the Sosnenskaya one and the rest of the fortress.\n\nDue to the fact that the wire net only covered half the distance between the railroad and the\n\nRudsky channel, some separate German parties started going around in order to attack the\n\nreserve from behind as they could not succeed from the front.\n\nAs a result, out of the whole front of the Sosnenskaya TO we only had the third area left with\n\nus; it separated the Germans operating to the left and to the right of it. The Germans advancing\n\nalong the railroad were in a hurry to increase their success and separated into several lines\n\nwhich followed one another and couldn\u2019t support each other in case we counterattacked.\n\nThe leading troops attacked the position of the reserve while the last troops were still near\n\nthe Leonovo community which they were adapting for their own defence.\n\nThe leader of the Sosnenskaya TO captain Potapov, seeing the critical situation his people\n\nwere in, ordered the militia men squadron that was in reserve to move forward and take over the\n\nrear trenches on the hill. Thanks to this order the enemy was stalled; in the meantime the\n\ncaptain asked for reinforcements from the head of the 2 nd defense department.\n\nAt the time when at the Sosnenskaya TO the enemy, meeting almost no resistance from the\n\npoisoned defenders of the 1 st , 2 nd and 4 th areas of the Sosnenskaya TO, took those areas and\n\nclosed in on the reserve, at the Belogrondskaya TO the Germans, counting about 2 squadrons,\n\nfollowed the gas and attacked the village of Belogrondy from north-west where by that time the\n\narea of approximately 2 versts only contained about 20 survivors with 2 machine guns one of\n\nwhich was operated by the warrant officer Retyunsky of the Zemlyansky regiment and the other\n\none by a machine gunner of the fortress artillery force. The Germans managed to cut down one\n\nrow of the wire fence pickets within 50 seconds but were driven away by the machine gun fire.\n\nAfter that they regrouped twice for an attack but were scattered by the machine gun and\n\nartillery fire, and also their further advancement in the section between the villages of Osovets\n\nand Belogrondy was likely partially stalled by the appearance in their flank and rear of the\n\nscouts of the Livensky regiment that had been sent from the Budnenskaya TO to find out the\n\nsituation at the Sosnenskaya TO.\n\nDue to this critical situation which the garrison of the Sosnenskaya TO was in, and also\n\nrealizing that the current state of affairs was a direct threat to the Zarechny fort and the\n\nZarechnaya TO\u2013as the Germans only had to defeat the reserve before storming the\n\nfortress\u2013the fortress artillery was ordered to create a curtain of fire in front of the Sosnenskaya\n\nTO and the head of the 2 nd defense department, colonel Kataev, was ordered to counterattack\n\nwith the available units of the Zemlyansky regiment.\n\nThe fortress artillerists, poisoned by the gas, could not start firing right away which was why\n\nthe point units and the first line of the enemy got through the front of the Sosnenskaya TO and\n\nstabbed the remaining defenders, seizing the anti-assault weapons and machine guns, but the\n\ncurtain of fire from the fortress artillery forces cut the enemy\u2019s reserves from the first line,\n\nstopped their assault and drove them back with big losses.\n\nThe head of the 2 nd defense department ordered the 13 th squadron to move from the\n\nZarechny fort to the Sosnenskaya TO, halt the Germans\u2019 advancement towards the fortress at\n\nany cost and gain back the lost 1 st area of the Sosnenskaya TO. The 14 th and the 8 th squadrons\n\nwere sent after them with the following orders: firstly to take back the village of Sosnya and\n\nsecondly to take back the 2 nd area of the Sosnenskaya TO.\n\nThe 13 th squadron which was the garrison of the Zarechny fort had already lost 20 men to\n\npoison gas; the commander of the squadron sub-lieutenant Kotlinsky was also poisoned but\n\nremained in the ranks. Combat-engineer officer sub-lieutenant Strzheminsky volunteered to be\n\ndeployed with this squadron in order to ascertain during the fight what fortification constructions\n\nwould be necessary within the Sosnenskaya TO.\n\nThe squadron, already strongly poisoned by the choking gas, crossed the bridge and the\n\none-verst-long log way under heavy artillery fire from the enemy, formed a line and started an\n\nattack along the railway.\n\nHaving stepped out onto the reserve echelon line, sub-lieutenant Kotlinsky personally\n\nconducted reconnaissance and, assessing the situation correctly, led his squadron into a swift\n\nattack from 500 paces toward the advancing German lines. The Germans opened heavy rifle\n\nand machine gun fire at the 13 th squadron and it didn\u2019t stop the charge despite the fact the\n\nsub-lieutenant Kotlinsky was at this moment lethally wounded and gave the command of the\n\nsquadron to combat-engineer officer sub-lieutenant Strzheminsky. The latter unsheathed his\n\nsword and with a yell of \u201cHurrah!\u201d charged at the Germans, leading the squadron. The terrain of\n\nthe attack was difficult: the ruins of old blindages were holes in the ground which people fell in;\n\nplanks and logs stuck out everywhere, etc., but the brave squadron, truly worthy of their late\n\ncommander, finished their swift attack and, using their bayonets, forced the Germans to\n\nabandon their positions and then also the front trenches of the 1 st and 2 nd areas of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO; in the meanwhile 14 prisoners were captured. Our anti-assault weapons and\n\nmachine guns that were in the trenches and had been previously taken by the Germans were\n\nwon back from the enemy in good condition. Sub-lieutenant Strzheminsky was suffering from\n\nacute poisoning from the choking gas but remained in the ranks.\n\nAfter retaking the 1 st and 2 nd areas of the Sosnenskaya TO and finding out that the village of\n\nBelogrondy was now ours, the attack at the Leonovo community began.\n\nThe terrain made the attack difficult. Our own wide wire fences were blocking the way.\n\nAttacking was only possible along the line of communication whose length was fired at by the\n\nGermans from the trench between the 2 nearest wire fences. We had to employ the French\n\nmethod of trench warfare with hand grenades and move forward using gun shields.\n\nThe fortress artillery focused their fire on the Leonovo community and their efforts went\n\nbeyond all expectations. The square plot of land, 50 paces in size, was bombarded from 9\n\nheavy batteries and 2 light ones, and also our troops opened fire at the enemy\u2019s rear from the\n\nBelogrondskaya TO and the first area. As a result, the Germans were mostly killed, with only a\n\nfew of them having had time to retreat, and there was even no need to attack with bayonets,\n\nand that was how by 10 AM we had taken over the last and most important bastion of the\n\nGermans.\n\nAt the time when at the first area there was fighting to retake the first area and the second\n\none, as well the Leonovo community, and when the gas started to disperse, the head of the 3 rd\n\narea, the commander of the 12 th squadron sub-lieutenant Cheglokov, having found out that the\n\nGermans were separated into 2 forces by his area and that one of those forces had taken over\n\nthe village of Sosnya and was determined to overwhelm the 3 rd area from the flank and the rear,\n\nimmediately moved a platoon to the flank and opened heavy rifle and machine gun fire at the\n\nGermans in order to prevent their takeover.\n\nDespite attacking fiercely, the Germans were defeated twice and had to retreat to the village\n\nof Sosnya where, hiding in the folds of the terrains and in the tall rye, they continued to shoot.\n\nAt this moment the 14 th squadron which had been sent to support the left flank of the\n\nSosnenskaya TO arrived. Sub-lieutenant Cheglokov together with his people and half the 14 th\n\nsquadron assumed the offensive energetically and, despite the Germans\u2019 strong resistance, he\n\npersonally led the troops into a bayonet attack which forced the Germans out of the trenches of\n\nthe village of Sosnya (the 4 th area) which he completely took over, returning our previously\n\ncaptured cannons and machine guns and also taking 14 prisoners.\n\nThe 8 th squadron which had been sent out after the 14 th squadron reinforced the second area\n\nof the Sosnenskaya TO and helped to keep it.\n\nIn this way, by 11 AM, that is, after 7 hours, the famous gas attack was finished and it was\n\nbrilliantly and selflessly resisted by parts of the glorious Zemlyansky regiment.\n\nAll direct commanders of the fortress, officers and soldiers of the Zemlyansky regiment and\n\nthe fortress artillery forces, poisoned by the gas in their majority, displayed heroism,\n\nselflessness and resourcefulness. The tiniest delay in sending the squadron out for a\n\ncounterattack, any tardiness in firing by the fortress artillery \u2013 they could all have led not only to\n\nlosing the Sosnenskaya TO but also to the Germans taking over the Zarechnaya TO and the\n\nZarechny fort the loss of which to the enemy would inevitably result in the fall of the fortress.\n\nThe captured Germans taken during the gas attack said that every attacker from the highest\n\ncommanders to the last private of the German division had been certain that this time the\n\ngarrison could not be saved, that nothing could withstand the power of the gaseous poison. The\n\ncertainty that the whole garrison would perish from the gas had been so great that the Germans\n\nhad assigned several squadrons in advance for burying the dead, and all carts had been\n\nprepared and ready to enter Osovets. For that reason the first shot and then the increasing fire\n\nfrom the fortress artillery was extremely astonishing and therefore it was possible to understand\n\nall the atrocities that the conniving enemy carried out against the honoured heroes who died for\n\nthe precious stronghold.\n\nThe enemy\u2019s new unsuccessful attempt to take the fortress via a gas attack did not\n\ndiscourage further efforts and, while continuing their blanketing fire, they, according to the words\n\nof the Polish soldiers who had defected to the fortress, started to prepare the second, an even\n\nmore lethal gas attack; but this second attack was late thanks to the fortress evacuation that\n\nfollowed.\n\nAll in all, this gas attack was the end of the military operations by the fortress. Although the\n\nGermans continued firing at the fortress, it was no longer as intense as previously. During this\n\nperiod of firing, scout parties from both sides went out to explore and some skirmishes occurred\n\nbetween small squads.\n\nOn the 4 th of August the fourth and the last period of the siege and defense of the fortress\n\nwas over.\n\nI hope this was of interest to some people, and anyone else who may come across this in the years to come.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1650299203.0},{"title":"The Gladiatrix \u2013 The Roman gladiators that were women","author":"Jspanky84","url":"https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2021\/07\/the-gladiatrix-the-roman-gladiators-that-were-women\/139803","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1650322521.0},{"title":"What is the last war of aggression between major powers where the aggressor was victorious?","author":"cucktrapped4lyfe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/history\/comments\/u63okz\/what_is_the_last_war_of_aggression_between_major\/","text":"I love history but in a casual sense.

But for most sword lengths, as you pull it straight up and out, your arm would be fully extended before you'd be able to get the sword all the way out of the sheath.\n\nOf course this depends on the length of the sword, arm length of the individual, etc. But I imagine it'd be a difficult process regardless.

But  as their method of fighting admits of individual motion for each  man\u2014because he defends his body with a shield, which he moves about to  any point from which a blow is coming, and because he uses his sword  both for cutting and stabbing,\u2014it is evident that each man must have a  clear space, and an interval of at least three feet both on flank and  rear, if he is to do his duty with any effect.\"*\n\nAs one roman would meet to greeks, a greek just takes 1.5 which is pretty much shoulder to shoulder it fits the description of a (really) dense formation.\n\nThe greeks at least would place their elbow over the shields, it therefore would be impossible to raise the shield to block a strike from above like from a sword. This would also explain why shock weapons, like the dane ax or the falx are striking from above, and are so effective. The roman fighting moves, use a lot of raising the shield which matches with the quote.  What is interesting is that the romans stole thier weapon designs from the Gauls, who use oval, and other tower  shields, with some rectangular however being relatively narrow. SO the roman descriptions of gauls fighting in a loose fashsion, individually, mid just mean that they fought similar to the romans, the narrow shields could allow to use the individual while still fighting relatively close together, They seem to small for overlap. When Cesar came they allready adopted a phalanx formation.\n\nBack to the topic, the shield wall seems to be the best formation for fighting a cohesive unit as a team, a tactic where the individual skill and movement is suppressed for the good of the whole. A Sword on the other hand seems to be the symbol of the individual fighter, the hero, the king, the champion, the raider.\n\nThe question is, can you keep up a shield wall in sword distance, and should you?\n\nWhen watching those reenactment battles or sca,  what i noticed is that people tend to raise their shields to stop the the enemy from striking over it. so both sides stike somewhat blindly over each others shield once they go shield to shield.  The shield wall really seems to work and hold when at spear point, which happened much more at sca (watched mainly Bridge battles, as they arent as chaotic) where spears and other pole arms are used as much if not more than shields. Sooner or later the shields would charge and often go shield to shield and engage in the above or even push into or back the formation. Its pretty brutal. pole arms are also surprisingly effective in this mess, being even (sometimes) able to hold thier ground and fight as their shield wall collapses into chaos.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vGR4dgeStOQ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vGR4dgeStOQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sword is an individual weapon, why would you even what to fight with in in a formation when you cant really support each other with it.\n\nin a shield wall it also seems hard to block strikes from above, like from a sword,\n\nwhis would aso explain why shock weapons, like the dane ax or the falx are striking from above, and are so effective.\n\nThe wedge formation makes also seense, as it is not a shield wall, (seems hard to impossible to maintain a dense formation with overlapping shields, tho a dense formation would be needed if you want to shove throu the enemy). The point of the wedge mind not be to push in or thru the formation, (could be and depends on angle, mass ecra) but you close in.\n\nPutting the boldest, best and most armoured, the leaders in the front, they take the brunt of the defence. The defender spear men mid all aim for the one in the front allowing and forcing the other to close in. Another posibility could be that large parts could reamain outside the spear range.\n\nBut that are just idears. \n\nLet me know what you think or what you know\/ have expirienced. I want to see other view point and opinions than mine on this. This is pretty theoretical and logical, so dont just quote some historian or try to interpret some other question into this. think and theorise about it, you mid just come up with a new posibility.

Tune in virtually here:https:\/\/museum.archives.gov\/events\/75277\n\nBenjamin Franklin was not a gambling man. His first bet was on himself, his last was a wager on the survival of the United States: a gift of two thousand pounds to Boston and Philadelphia, to be lent out to tradesmen over the next two centuries to jump-start their careers. Each loan would be repaid with interest over ten years. If all went according to Franklin\u2019s inventive scheme, the accrued final payout in 1991 would be a windfall. In \"Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Last Bet,\" I trace the evolution of these twin funds as they age alongside America itself, bankrolling woodworkers and silversmiths, trade schools and space races. Over time, Franklin\u2019s wager was misused, neglected, and contested\u2014but never wholly extinguished. Franklin\u2019s inspiring stake in the \u201cleather-apron\u201d class remains in play to this day. \n\nI took a wide route to this story, starting when I was sent to China in 1995 as one of its first Peace Corps volunteers. I wrote three nonfiction books set in China, as well as numerous stories for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and many other outlets. I'm a Guggenheim Fellow and Whiting Award winner, and currently a Fulbright scholar in Taipei and a fellow at Oxford University's Centre for Life-Writing, working on a biography of Taiwan.

Even when Persia does show up in western media, it is almost always either shown from the Greek perspective and demonized to the point of parody (i.e. 300) or heavily Arabized.
