As an interviewer and expert in transhumanism, ChatGPT provided a unique and biased perspective on this intriguing topic. In this article, we will explore some of the questions and answers that arose during the conversation, including the benefits and risks of improving intelligence through technology and the associated ethical concerns. We will also discuss how the experiment provides us with a glimpse of how AIs could be used for conversations in the future, and how we should be prepared to face these technological and social changes that are on the horizon.  \n\n\nFull Article: [globaltranshuman.wordpress.com](https://globaltranshuman.wordpress.com)",

        "text": " In this article, we learn about three metabolic pathways — SIRT, AMPk, and mTOR — and how they relate to aging. Sirtuins, a family of proteins that regulate gene expression, activate the SIRT pathway and have been shown to delay aging and improve resistance to age-related diseases. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk), an energy sensor in cells, activates the AMPk pathway and delays aging by improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates cell growth and proliferation, has been linked to aging and age-related diseases. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway has been shown to prolong lifespan and prevent age-related diseases.\n\nTo promote healthy aging, activating the SIRT and AMPk pathways and inhibiting the mTOR pathway are useful strategies. Caloric restriction and exercise have been demonstrated as effective strategies for activating the SIRT and AMPk pathways and reducing mTOR activity. Caloric restriction has been shown to increase sirtuin expression and decrease mTOR activity, while exercise has been shown to increase sirtuin expression and decrease mTOR activity.\n\nOverall, understanding these metabolic pathways and their role in aging can inform therapeutic targets for preventing or delaying age-related diseases. If you want to learn more about these pathways and how they can be activated or inhibited, read the full article.\n\nFull text: [https://transhuman-organization.gitbook.io/freecourses/free-courses/aging-course/live-slower-and-longer](https://transhuman-organization.gitbook.io/freecourses/free-courses/aging-course/live-slower-and-longer)  \n\n\n[https://medium.com/@transhumanorg/live-slower-and-longe-168335e57c20](https://medium.com/@transhumanorg/live-slower-and-longe-168335e57c20)",

CRISPR is, by my understanding, targeted towards specific cells and so would only be effective in this way if used on an embryo, however I had thought that perhaps the use of a virus carrying the CRISPR could be used to spread the modified gene to all of a persons cells.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on how this problem may be overcome please let me know so I can put some research into it, also for anyone with similar interests I'm going to create a discord server which I will leave in a reply below.",

However, I doubt that computers are the only way we can make brains better. How might we exponentially increase the capabilities human brains already possess? Creativity? Fluid intelligence? Situational awareness? Information overload is a common problem even among the laymen, let alone for experts--can we somehow improve the brain's raw processing power so that we can learn faster and more thoroughly, and better deal with the massive amount of information we're exposed to?",

We need an explosion of interest and research,  and that's where  Open Longevity comes in.\n\nWe  believe we found a solution to grow  and organize the community in our  field. And as a result grow the field  exponentially. In fact, we don’t  see any other option to do so.\n\nIt’s   an algorithm, a step-by-step plan which include surveys, selecting and   giving out tasks and instructions, and automatization. Let’s bring big   data approach into social research. People is the major factor we’re  all  relying on, so let’s study people and their opinions and decisions   better!\n\nThe first step is  creating a funnel and a measurement  system (2 in 1) for social changes.  That's why we're excited to  introduce the Counterclockwise Project.  This project will create a set  of questionnaires to describe all  activities and tasks related to  transhumanism.\n\nTo  kick off this project, we've created a survey  about people's attitudes  towards death and life extension.

We need an explosion of interest and research, and that's where  Open Longevity comes in.  \n\n\nWe believe we found a solution to grow  and organize the community in our field. And as a result grow the field  exponentially. In fact, we don’t see any other option to do so.  \n\n\nIt’s  an algorithm, a step-by-step plan which include surveys, selecting and  giving out tasks and instructions, and automatization. Let’s bring big  data approach into social research. People is the major factor we’re all  relying on, so let’s study people and their opinions and decisions  better!  \n\n\nThe first step is creating a funnel and a measurement  system (2 in 1) for social changes. That's why we're excited to  introduce the Counterclockwise Project. This project will create a set  of questionnaires to describe all activities and tasks related to  transhumanism.  \n\n\nTo kick off this project, we've created a survey  about people's attitudes towards death and life extension. It will only  take 10-15 minutes of your time, and it will be a good start for  interpret the longevity field.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/11k1h95/ethics_ai_as_control_rod_for_agi_or_artificial/",
        "text": "So, Artificial General Intelligence is an important topic, since AGI is often copnsidered necessary in order to achieve a technological singularity. However, one of the problems with AGI is the allignment problem, i.e. that we can not be sure, that an AGI could be misalligned with human intrests, resulting in catastrophic damage to human wellbeing. An example for this would be the paperclipmaximizer, where an incredibly powerfull AGI devoted to one particular goal devotes everything to this goal, to severe detriment of human wellbeing. However, formulating a complete ruleset that covers any conceivable situation is quite difficult, given that \"human wellbeing\" is a fuzzy concept that is difficult to define - I mean, religions, lawmakers and philosphers have tried thouout the milenia have tried thoughout the milenia to come up with static rulesets covering any possibility, but we still need an entire branch of gouvernment - the judicary - to decide on a case-by-case basis. So a static ruleset is probably not the way to go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd here comes my idea in: what is really good at classifying things, where the rules for a classification are difficult to define but in a lot of cases obvious to a human? Current day machine learning algorithms. My idea is basically, to create a large amount of ethical scenarios (real and fictional), and have a lot of humans make a judgement onto the ethicality of the actors in those scenarios on a point-scale (we should probably make sure that all scenarios are evaluated by a large number of humans from a diverse selection of demographics in order to ensure, that the aggregate judgement is a reflection of humans in the broad, not just a select group). At least a large number of those scenarios should also be such, that after revealing some further context, the ethicality of the scenario in question changes significantly. These ethical scenarios and there attached human classifications would then be feed into a machine learning algorithm that then learns to judge the ethical value of an action. Thus, we create an artificial conscience. While it would not be the ethical value of any particular human, it would be an ethics system broadly compatibel with general consensous human ethics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis artificial conscience would then be attached as a control rod to any AGI (as well as any AI's showing to much hint at the possibility of developing sentience) with a feedback function, the \"guilt\" function, applied to the AGI with the strength depending on how the artificial conscience judges the actions of the AGI. So, for example, if the AGI were to be mean to a human it would receive some negative feedback, but if this averts significant physical harm to the human or a large number of humans, the artificial conscience would understand this context and give a positive feedback. If the feedback, both positively and negatively, would be strong enough, we could then be assured, that the AGI would not be going to harm humans (or, more precisely, only harm necessary to avert greater harm), due to it being set up such that it understands what constitutes harm and would harm itself if it were to harm human wellbeing.",
