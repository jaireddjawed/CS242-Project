        "text": "I'm still pretty young, and based on average life expectancy projections (even without genetic/cybernetic enhancements to extend life), I should live well into the second half of the 21st century, most likely dying sometime during the final quarter. I'm fairly certain that within my lifetime (though probably not until the second half), we'll have technology like prosthetic arms with feeling and full range of motion, BCIs, contact lenses/eye implants with screens, etc. I also know that, as long as I wouldn't lose any of the previous functionality or feeling, I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade a significant portion of my body. I have always hoped that one day I'd be able to do this, and I'm confident the technology will get there. But I still don't think I will.\n\nWhile the technological advances seem totally feasible, I have trouble picturing a world where we've left behind the corporate-controlled capitalist oligarchy within the next century. No matter what advantages it comes with, I wouldn't feel comfortable or safe if there was even the slightest possibility that someone was trying to make money off my enhancements (beyond the initial price). Especially not any enhancements to the \"primary\" senses (sight and hearing). The more integrated we become with digital technology in the current era, the more advertising pops up everywhere. Every time I see a mobile game ask players to watch a video in order to keep playing, get free currency, reduce wait times, or just *because*, I shudder to think what the future would be like if transhumanism became a reality without first leaving capitalism behind.\n\nFor a better explanation, check out [this excellent video that you've probably already seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E).",

Mind upload is not only amazing because of the potential life-span effects but it drives hard towards the big issues surrounding the purpose of human life and what we are actually trying to achieve as a species.  Once living as a computer we will be able to modify our brains much more easily as hardware and software is much more easy to edit than biological brains.\n\nWould it be good to increase thinking abilities and reduce emotion?  Who knows.  It will be a fascinating time.\n\nPersonally I would like to edit out the sexual pleasure circuits or at least program myself to have the ability to switch them off.  I think the purpose of sex is to procreate and form a bond with someone that helps support the child.  For people who don't want to have children, like me, then this biological reproduction and bonding ability is pointless.  \n\nSome people who don't want children already chose to make use of this sexual neuro-circuitry and form a mutually beneficial partnership for other reasons.  Not me though, I'd rather evolve past it. \n\nIf they manage to reverse ageing to keep me alive long enough for mind-upload tech to be available, I'll happily edit out my sexual neuro-circuits.  For me they are a vestigial brain region.\n\nWhat would you edit or add to your mind/brain if you upload yourself? ",

Although the idea proposes thinking in new directions and seem to be reasonable, I am a little concerned about the method the researchers proposed to use:\nThey suggest to put the digital entity that is to be tested into an environment where it is completely cut off from outside stimuli and then look if it starts thinking about questions like what is consciousness, or similar reflections.\n(For a more detailed picture, please read the article.) They would study it in this box until they are sure it is conscious.\nNow, assuming the entity would be conscious before being pushed into the box (or is conscious but already in the box), wouldn't a lack of outside stimuli come with the danger of driving it crazy, just like a human that goes crazy in a consealed box.\nOr is that purely a human quality/flaw?\nWhat do you think?",

So far, I have been avoiding the self-service machines, mostly since they only allow payment with cards and I prefer cash.\n\nBut as I was standing in line for the traditional checkout today, I was wondering: what would be the ethically correct behaviour in this situation, or more general: **What should be my behaviour when faced with a choice of human labour vs. automation that has no other consequence for myself (neither is cheaper, faster or more convenient)?**\n\n\nConsidering the larger-scale societal turmoil stemming from the replacement of unskilled human labour by machines, which is only going to be worsening as more jobs become accessible to automation: Eventually, a transition to a post-work society will have to occur, but it is not yet in progress. The immediate result of a human losing their job to a machine is an additional person losing a potentially living wage, so I should not be contributing to this progress.\n\nOn the other hand, wouldn't it maybe be more humane if the post-work transition were performed as quickly as possible? Maybe keeping a replaceable person in employ is only delaying the inevitable?\n\nMy choice between human-operated and automatic supermarket checkout has a ridiculously tiny effect on the progression of automation, but the cumulative effect, if the whole population were to make this descision one way or the other, would be quite significant.\n\nSo, should I be trying to delay this development, if only a tiny bit, thus giving society more time to adapt? Or should I hasten it best I can, to force a more rapid transition into a post-work society?\n\n(I would like to add that this is a fantastic age to live in, where this is an actual ethical question that occured in my daily life.)",

        "text": "Most conflicts between transhumanists always come from h+ own definition being loose. People [told me](https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/6gmtc5/serious_how_many_of_you_have_health/dirro62/) that I have a \"different understanding\" of this movement, and I have seen many other people being accused of it([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/6lb39f/lonely_robots_transhumanist_responses_to/djta0c7/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/6lb39f/lonely_robots_transhumanist_responses_to/djtqtpq/)) as well. This movement can't begin developing in all directions possible, those being cybernetics, biotech, cryogenics, pills etc. If it would be concentrated in one direction, we would see more progress.\n\nI know that this is a new movement and it is in it early stages, but I wanted to discuss this topic. Transhumanists strive to reach ideals, and everyone has his own definition of ideal. Human body is very complex and it will require a lot of money spent for research and development of such technologies. Current parties don't seem interested in this area and we don't have proper transhumanist parties yet. Tech giants like Google tried to invest in age reversal related medicine, but there are no results yet. ",

Most accidents involve blunt force trauma, either you crashing into something or something crashing into you that will turn your brand new designer organs into soup. \n\nMy question is (disregarding the possibility of mind transfer) how would we best enhance a human body to survive blunt force impact trauma? Lets say a fall at terminal velocity at the bare minimum. What would you have to do to your body to walk away from that? ",

Very cool experience.\n\nAnyone have any similar experiences?",

With the increasing approach of the singularity, where do you see spirituality headed? Will there be more or less religious people and why? With the advent of science truly coming to pass even now will people still need religion in the coming decades? It's a curious subject to me and if nothing else is a good brain exercise in futurism.",
