        "text": "Ok, I know this will sound a bit delusional, but I came up with an interesting theory that might explain how to calculate collective free will. I'm no mathematician nor a philosopher, so please point the holes in this theory. I just want to share this idea because I have not found anyone talking about it.\n\nSo I watched the video about the logistics map ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&amp;t=237s&amp;ab\\_channel=Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&amp;t=237s&amp;ab_channel=Veritasium)) from [**Veritasium**](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) which was great, but a question pops up in my mind. Why can we calculate a population of rabbits and not the population of humans? What makes this formula work for rabbits and not work for humans? I might have an answer.\n\nRabbits make decisions based on the present, while humans make decisions based on the present and the future! If we apply the formula of the logistics map for humans, it doesn't work because we can somewhat predict the outcome and change it. Example: Rabbits will simply search for food when they are hungry, while humans think on the future and start making farms and so on.\n\nI have no idea how to represent this mathematically, since we predict a future that is not necessarily true (we are not fortune tellers) and make mistakes, and each one of us have different predictions based on our perceptions. But there might be a way to calculate the overall effect of our collective decisions in a chaotic system. The secret for this is related to the Feigenbaum constant.\n\nLet's take a chaotic system which humans are involved: the stock market. If make a deep analysis, we could point bifurcation points of when the stock market changes. If try to divide the length of it, we would reach a random number which means absolutely nothing on its own. Let call that number the Raw Will.\n\nThe Raw will means nothing on its own, however, if compare it with the Feigenbaum constant, we could in theory calculate the effect of human behavior on that system.\n\nRaw Will / Feigenbaum constant = Free Will aspect\n\nIf the result is lower than 1, it means that human behavior is making the system change faster than natural. If the result is higher than 1, it means that human behavior is making the system change slower than natural.\n\nIn the case of the stock market, a system completely depended on human behavior which incentivizes short term gains and changes, the result should should be way lower than 1.\n\nIf this theory is real, there could be **a lot** of applications. Here are some examples I can think of on the top of my head:\n\n\\- Studies to see which markets are changing faster or slower. Probably the most useful application for analyzing the economy of certain countries and companies. If this theory is true, there could be a new metrics for analyzing stock markets and predicting when the stock goes up or down.\n\n\\- Study on the effects of human behavior in natural systems. Could be useful to understand how are we affecting the climate and other studies for ecological preservation.\n\n\\- We could analyze natural systems outside of our planet. If the Feigenbaum constant does not match, it could mean that there were interference of intelligent life. (this is a bit of a stretch to be honest).\n\n\\- Could the Feigenbaum constant represent the will of god? Could this be the key to understand weird coincidences like synchronicity? (I have no idea to be honest)\n\nSo please tell me what you think about this theory. If this is completely wrong, just point out why. Would be really interesting to know the reasons behind and learn more.\n\nHowever, if you can prove this theory is correct, just don't forget to mention this post and [**Veritasium**](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) when you win the nobel prize lol.",

        "text": "I believe that I understand Kant's moral framework to a reasonable extent. My understanding is that our will to action should be guided by a top-level principle, namely the CI. Living in accordance with this principle guides our actions in a way that allows us to take full moral responsibility for the consequences. Because our actions were guided by a rational maxim external to motivations of consequence.\n\nSo my question is how can any action be universalized when it can't really be extricated from its context. Isn't any one action comprised of multiple actions? I mean this more that each action exists within a range of contexts such as the physical, psychological, interpersonal, societal, political, cultural, religious, and artistic (and probably way more than that)\n\nI'm assuming that Kant would prefer that our maxims be created at the psychological and interpersonal levels, but doesn't that undermine all the other levels? \n\nFor example, when describing a maxim internally before taking an action, 'Lying to the Nazi officer.' Couldn't this action be reframed as 'Protecting a vulnerable people' at the societal or religious levels. I assume that Kant would respond by saying that the action of \"protecting\" is more abstract, but lying is fairly abstract when compared to actions on a physical level. One could say, 'I'm just vibrating my vocal cords' and will that into a universal.\n\nThank you in advance for any responses!",

I know I need to read the Republic/Phaedrus/Gorgias. Should I continue on to read the Stanford entry on Aristotle's logic so that I know what, exactly, people like Descartes were working with?

        "text": "I get into a lot of arguments with friends in my highschool philosophy class and with people online. So, I naturally came to noticing something about moral relativism thst I've never seen adressed is that it appears to be circular/question begging in regards to how it justifies itself.\n\nThe justification I've heard was to point out moral differences between different cultures, or between individuals, deoending on the type of relativist. But that argument for moral relativism only holds up if you already believe in relativism. A non relativist would be perfectly good if they retort \"disagreement =/= subjective\"\n\nAnd Relativism, as far as I've heard from those arguing for it, is completely lacking in the dedication department. I've always found it strange that relativism is induced rather then Deduced like with natural law or Kantian ethics are. I've never seen any \"from first principles/deduced from the [blank] axiom\" justification for relativism.\n\nHow does/would Relativism reply to these objections?",

I was broke, unemployed, and on my ass. I was really desperate, and I had to suck it up and take a job at Amazon to make ends meet, something I really didn't want to do. So I decided to do a ritual invoking an angel to improve my life and be happy. It was an eleven day long ritual, and on the eleventh day, I started my new job. The job at Amazon is nowhere near as horrible as everybody made it out to be. It's easy, it's mindless work, the people are really cool, there's not much responsibility, and this is the most money I've ever made in my life. A week after I started my job, I got a fifty cent raise. Two weeks after I started my job, I went on a date with a very attractive woman. I mean it, she's gorgeous. I took her home with me that night and she became my girlfriend. She gave me the most erotic experiences of my life. Five weeks after I started my job, I bought the first car I have ever owned in my life. I've always been too poor to buy and maintain a car, but I finally accomplished that feat. My life's been going incredibly well. There's really not much more I can ask for. But it's just not good enough. It didn't work out with my girlfriend, the fireworks didn't last. And now when I'm not at work I'm just sitting around, eating, drinking and getting fat. I got what I wanted most in life, and... now what? I've been having (yet another) existential crisis because I just don't know what the point of anything is anymore. What am I supposed to be working for? What goal is worthy of pursuit? I just feel lost and confused because I now understand that getting what I want in life will only bring me temporary happiness. Can you please impart some wisdom on me?",

        "text": "I don‘t study philosophy, or Theology, and am now only in my first semester of math. I only heard much on the internet about it, and thought about it for a while.\n\nAccording to wikipedia the principle of sufficient reason (short: PSR) states, that everything must have a reason or a cause.\n\nI and many other people have problems with it, but don‘t want to discard it, since without some version of it we don‘t have a basis to believe our rationale. The problems are many, and different. Be it quantum physics, or that time would need a cause, or that it leads to paradoxes when reduced to its logical conclusions. Because of all that I think philosophy should (and probably is already) search(ing) for alternatives, that still fills all the good functions of what we have now.\n\nMy suggestion, that undoubtably still has much to improve goes as follows, and I wonder if you think it moves into the right direction:\n\nEvery constellation has causes in accordance with entropy.\n\nI think it could fit better, since it removes the reason/explanation aspect of it, which I think should be removed since reasons are just causes multiple causal links away to which we give huge importance, because they mean the most to us. Quantum physics also wouldn‘t be a problem, since it is probabilities, and not chaos. So there are still causes to why something happens, and because only constellations have causes, the question “Why is it one way, and not another?“ would be a question without an answer.\n\nSince the universe in the B theory of time can be seen as a constellation, and time can‘t just be taken out of spacetime (and energy out of energy/matter) one could say that the universe would need causes, but it would have to be in accordance with entropy, so it would be bound in the confines of spacetime. For that reason the universe wouldn‘t need causes.\n\nSo yeah! That‘s my idea. What do you think? Is there any good in it?",

We can take any political example as a vehicle for this-- let's say that in my view, liberal policies are best for society. But I have someone else in my life who believes that conservative policies are best. Let's say that I can accept that there is no absolute truth to whichever person is right in this context (both policies will have blindspots that the other would not).\n\nHowever, if you get that far, what is to stop you from believing there is no truth to anything, or none of your judgments are worth anything more than personal preference? IE, if I can believe liberal policies are best, but understand someone who believes conservative policies are best and respect their view/intelligence, then how am I able to form a strong opinion about *anything* that anyone else disagrees with? Is it possible to say that there is no absolute truth to whether liberal/conservative policies are best, but that there is an absolute truth as to whether (for example) abortion should be legal? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, how do you simultaneously hold the view that all well-formed (i.e. thought through) opinions are valuable in general (including your own), but still find yourself able to hold extremely strong beliefs about any one issue in particular? How do you trust your own judgement, knowing that \"trusting your own judgment\" is exactly what causes other people to confidently arrive at conclusions that your judgment would deem completely incorrect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks all!",

Background or distant matter is not needed. Put two objects in relative (planar) motion; now bind them with an elastic string, and we are not surprised when the string stretches.\n\nWith this in mind, consider that any spinning object necessarily has spatially-separated and physically bound extremities. Any rotation of the object will put stress on that object due to the relative motion of those extremities and the effects of that stress will act on the binding structure of the object. In other words, absolute rotation would be identifiable even if the object were the only thing in existence.",

        "text": "In book 4.8 of Aristotle's *Physics*, he gives an argument against the existence of a void from fastness and slowness. I believe I understand the first part of the argument but I'm having some trouble understanding the second.\n\nAristotle starts by stating that \"the same weight and body is carried faster through two causes, either by a difference in the through-which, as through water rather than earth or through air rather than water, or by a difference in what is carried.\" (215a25-28). He then focuses on the first part (i.e. the through-which) and outlines the following scenario:\n\n* A travels through B in time C\n* A travels through D in time E\n\nThen, he states: \"let B be water and D air; by as much as air is thinner and less bodily than water, by this much will A have been carried faster through D than through B. Let the speed have to the speed the same ratio that stands between air and water. So if air is doubly thin, it will go through B in a time double that through D, and time C will be the double of E.\" (215b3-9). This part I understand, it's the more-so the next part that I'm having trouble with.\n\nHe then argues that the void can have no ratio to the full, just as zero has no ratio to any number, and returns to the previous scenario, saying:\n\n&gt;For let F be a void, equal in magnitude to B and D. Now if A goes through it, and will have been moved in some time G, less than E, the void will have this ratio to the full. But in a time just as much as G, in D, A will go through a distance H. But it will also go through some thing F which is different from air in thinness in the same ratio which the time E has to G. For if the body F is thinner than D by so much as E exceeds G, A will go through F with a speed determined by the inverse ratio of the times, if it is carried there. So if there is no body in F, it will go still faster. But it went through it in time G. Therefore, in an equal time it goes through what is full and what is void, which is impossible. Accordingly, it is clear that if there is a time in which a thing will be carried through any amount whatever of void, this impossible thing will follow: an equal time will have been taken to traverse something which is full and something which is void. (215b22-216a7)\n\nMy understanding is that if the void can have no ratio to the full, then the time it takes to traverse the void can have no ratio to the time it takes to traverse the full. I'm just having trouble following this part of his argument, so any help is much appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I've tried finding information on this topic, and maybe because of the wording the majority of information I have found is stuff from the Catholic faith (my wording and the way I feel about this might be influenced by growing up in a mildly Catholic household). This isn't really what I am looking for though.\n\nI am a pretty forgiving person, and my intuition would have me believe that people are capable of change. Even if they have done something morally wrong in the past, they can still work on themselves and become a better person. However, the belief that people can change leads me to a tricky situation where there could be situations where people are 'redeemed' for seemingly irredeemable acts. \n\nFor an example, lets look at someone who has committed murder. If they go to prison, reflect on their life, and change themselves for the better can they still be held morally culpable for the actions they committed in the past? It seems tricky to have someone still being held fully responsible for an action they did before that they would never do now. They can never take the actions they did back, so if they change themselves for the better is it entirely pointless? How do they move on?\n\nI think that many of us can think of circumstances where somebody would deserve forgiveness for murder. However, there are more extreme examples of serial killers or some of the most horrible people in history (not naming names, but I'm sure you can think of some) where my gut tells me that they can never come back from it. Looking into it further I don't have any logical basis for this belief. If I think that someone can come back from something as long as they have truly changed, shouldn't it apply regardless of what they have done?\n\nIf people really can change then how is it fair to never be able to come back from an action you regret? Maybe the starting point of this question should be whether or not it is possible to truly change who you are - but seeing how different I am from my childhood vs. my teenage years vs. now in early adulthood, I think that this must be true. It just becomes interesting because on a long enough timeline the actions you did in the past could almost be seen as being done by an entirely different person. (It really doesn't help that the more that I think about it I can't be sure that free will really exists, considering we are all products of our environment and the chemicals in our brain, but I digress).\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for philosophers that have thoughts on this from an atheist perspective? Or any insights of their own? This question seems to get a lot more difficult without having completely objective morals and a forgiving God.",

        "text": "I’ve noticed a few philosophers, specifically Don Garrett, Andreas Keller, and Lilly-Marlene Russow, describe color space as made up of brightness, saturation, and hue (I’ll call this BSH theory). This comes up in discussions of Hume’s Missing Shade of Blue, as well as other parts of philosophy of perception, like Dr. Kepler’s Philosophy of Olfactory Perception. I don’t understand why anyone would want to represent color in this way, so I’m turning to y’all to see if I’m missing something. My biggest confusion is about hue in particular: \n\nImagine what the three axes of the space of color would look like on this model. Does the BSH view commit us to thinking that all hues are of a single continuous kind? Of course it’s possible to lay out a spectrum of hues, but the fact that we often display colors in a wheel suggests that there is no objective beginning or order. Our axis could proceed from reds to blues to greens, or from reds to greens to blues, and the only ways to complete it would be to A) turn it into a wheel, or B) make it discontinuous by including mixes of first and third colors at one end.\n\nMoreover, it seems like brightness and saturation would have to be undefined at 0 hue, rather than simply representing a lack of brightness and saturation. Doesn’t it seem odd that we could dial up saturation without picking any hue in particular? And same for brightness?\n\nWhy not use intensity along three axes, each representing either red, green, or blue (RGB theory)? In this model, all of the edges are clearly defined as just lack of color. It’s easy to conceive of red with no admixture of blue and green. Brightness would be something like distance from the origin, while saturation would be more be something like distance from the line  connecting the origin and farthest corner (pretending there is a corner). Please forgive me if those don’t make sense, the point is just that I think we can represent brightness and saturation, as well as every other intrinsic property of color, in RGB colorspace without a problem.\n\nPlease let me know if I’m misunderstanding something, or where to look for more info!",

But, i thought, what if there are (either theoretical or real) structures above humanity, and that within these structures we would simply be the metaphorical \"cells\"?\n\nSomething else i saw was a picture of human brain activity and heatmap photos of the cosmos, and the photos looked almost exactly the same. Another one was blood vessels and ancient human road systems. This made me think maybe it's tied into the idea of the path of least resistance? Like both blood vessels and road systems would want to expend the least amount of energy as possible and take the easiest path?\n\nThen there are fractals, which are a mathematical concept primarily i think, but the general idea with them is that they repeat the same or similar structures at every different scale, both higher and lower than the one you're currently on.\n\nI think fractals come closest to the idea i'm trying to get across. It's also a phenomena i've observed in music as i've studied composition, how fragments make up motifs which make up a phrase which make up a melody which make up a section which make up a piece of music, but on each of those levels, they all use the same type of construction. All these similar patterns are simply nested within each other and each layer is functionally it's own list of sublayers.

        "text": "I’ll start by admitting I haven’t read any of Land’s books and I’m only vaguely familiar with the concept of accelerationism. His style of writing really puts me off and English isn’t my first language, so I have to double my attention if I’m to understand anything he says.\n\nI’ve seen his work in the CCRU and the University of Warwick be lauded by people from across the political spectrum and he seems to have collaborated with Mark Fisher and Sadie Plant. However, he also serms to have devolved into nothing more than a petty Twitter persona, a sort of Elon Musk with a Philosophy Ph.D, but on clearly more dangerous tone, since he appears bent on promoting “scientific racism” and associating LGBT people with pedophilia.\n\nDoes Land actually believes in stuff like this or does he do it just to be edgy? Why is he apparently so well-regarded in many philosophical circles, including by people whose ideology are explicitly on the opposite end of his? Do any of his theories actually hold up and what are they?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": " \n\nEverywhere we see, we see in the past; this simple fact was astonishing to me growing up that we never can live in the present, always lingering a few milliseconds in the past, even in our everyday lives.\n\nI discovered later on in life, though, that this was true in more ways than just in relation to the speed of light.\n\nLet's start by trying to imagine that. Since light in a vacuum has a finite speed (300000km/s), we may instinctively think that it is fast, but in the grand scheme of things, it looks pale.\n\nThe sun is roughly 150 million KM away from us, so light takes nearly eight full minutes to reach us from the sun.\n\nWhenever you look up at the sky, you are not seeing how it is in your current moment; you are seeing how it was 8 minutes ago from your perspective.\n\nLet's imagine next a 2D universe with the same rules as ours. Let's put a 2D sun and a 2D earth; according to einstein's general relativity, the two masses are now bending that 2D universe.\n\nIf there were 2D beings on that earth, they wouldn't be able to see any bending, while for us who are 3D beings observing them, even in our imagination, we can see how the fabric of the universe is being pushed and bent into the 3rd dimension.\n\nAfter understanding this simple concept, you can now try to apply it to our 3D universe; we 3D beings can't perceive our universe being bent into the 4th dimension.\n\nFor us, movement in the 4th dimension is perceived as a movement in time; this is even more evident if we also consider time dilation.\n\nThe fact that once the universe is bent into the 4th dimension, time is slowed down in that area makes it easier to imagine.\n\nThese factors alone give us a clearer image of the universe's interactions.\n\nBecause of our limitations, we can only look ahead of ourselves in 3 dimensions, and everywhere we see, we are looking back in the 4th dimension.\n\nThis means that everything we perceive, everything that interacts with our body, everything that happens inside of it, and all the information being processed in our neurons is happening behind us in the 4th dimension.\n\nFrom this, we can imagine some possibilities:\n\n* That radiation travels ahead in the 4th dimension. The angle at which it is being released forward determines the speed of light in our universe.\n* Radiation travels everywhere in the 4th dimension as well. The angle at which our conscious mind can perceive light from behind us determines the speed of light in our universe.\n* Radiation travels everywhere in the 4th dimension. Each of us has his observable universe, which is bent backward in the 4th with us as the center. The angle at which it is bent determines the speed of light.\n\nIs time an illusion of our conscious mind, or is it an illusion of movement of the universe in the 4th dimension?",

Still, even if I don't read the commentaries right after reading Aristotle's books, will they be worth reading then (when I get to Aquinas), or should I read them straight away (after Aristotle's books) for maximum value, or are Aquinas' commentaries negligible (and I should focus mainly on Aquinas' Summas when I get there)?\n\nSorry, I know my question is all over the place, but I just want to get an idea of how I should proceed in order to get familiar with both these thinkers, and if I should tackle them both together, or not, and also if it's worth getting into the commentaries or just the summas.",
