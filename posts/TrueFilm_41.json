        "text": "Hello, everyone. I saw John Frankenheimer's \"Seconds\" during the summer of 2015, and I liked it a lot. I was intrigued by its concept, and how it had so many existential/philosophical connotatations to it. The plot of \"Seconds\" was ingenious, and its ties to self-loathing &amp; dissatisfaction fascinated me. \n\nCurrently, though, I think that \"Seconds\" was truly a film that was ahead of its time. I mean, the cinematography is impressive in certain places, and the main plot of the film deals with plastic surgery, starting over with a new life &amp; becoming a new person. I thought that it was unusual that \"Seconds\" tackled the plastic surgery industry in 1966, and the themes of the film have such heavy meanings to them. For me, it's astounding how a 1960s film could be so philosophical, and its themes resonate very well, in the age of Facebook, Instagram, Botox &amp; plastic surgery. \n\nSo, would you guys say that John Frankenheimer's \"Seconds\" was ahead of its time?

        "text": "I was so blown away by this film that I had to post something here. Let me know what you guys thought of course.\n\nIt is rare and exhilarating to have a movie force you to take it in on its terms, with a complete disregard for your aesthetic preconceptions. Instead of pandering to your expectations, the directorial choices in The Turin Horse serve to frustrate them in an effort to produce a very negative emotion: angst, and it achieves what it sets out to achieve completely. \n\nThe formal elements clearly belie a master at work. The cinematography is austere and awesome, in the traditional sense of the word and the score is ominous and droning, clearly mirroring the wind and world outside.\n\nThe life led by these peasants, a life all too common at the time, and still in existence today, is so monotonous, and Tarr manages to convey that through his excruciatingly long takes. In fact he achieves it to such an extent that whenever there is a slight disturbance to the common flow of things, like a knock on the door it almost feels like a jump-scare. We are exhilarated by occurrences that, if they had occurred in your average movie would simply be normal plot points, for example the gypsies coming and fetching water and even the family’s attempted “escape\".\n\nThere is of course a ton of depth here that goes beyond the brutal misanthropy and realism that lies at the core of the film. Nietzsche’s philosophy is briefly alluded to by the neighbor during his tirade about the city, during which he talks about the fact that good and evil do not exist and that what is noble and great in the universe lost out against what is not. Nietzsche was obsessed with what is noble; it was the entire purpose of his philosophy to go “beyond good and evil” and serve one’s “will to power” to become an inherently noble and great “ubermensch.” After writing some of the most magnificent prose in human history in near isolation, with very few real world accomplishments, Nietszche tragically died without ever having married and after having spent a decade without a properly functioning brain, perhaps the worst imaginable punishment for an intellectual of his caliber. For anyone this would seem to show that the world can be a cruel place.\n\nTarr’s inclusion of the neighbor’s speech in the movie serves to illustrate the driving philosophy of the movie. Once the sad truth of social reality and history is incorporated into one’s view of the world it becomes clear where Nietzsche’s philosophy fails. For so many people, the possibility of aspiring to become an ubermensch is way off-limits. Because of poverty, or illness, etc, the best most of us can do is endure and continue to “try again tomorrow” as they say at the end of the movie.\n\nThis is not to say that the movie is a denunciation of Nietzschean philosophy. In fact to me it seems to be profoundly sympathetic to the tragedy of his life and death and uses his outburst of care in the apocryphal story about the Turin Horse to suggest that deep inside, Nietzsche understood that for some, just like for the horse, the ubermensch is out of reach and life, no matter what they try to do, is nothing but suffering, monotony, and absence of meaning.\n\nIn the first film of Tarr’s I saw, “Werckmeister Harmonies” his use of long takes bored me and seemed unnecessary. In The Turin Horse they serve a clear purpose and are masterful and indispensable. There is nothing I could criticize this film for; nothing.",

        "text": "*Spoiler alert*\n\nI recently re-watched Edgar Wright's Baby Driver (2017) on a transatlantic flight. I remember seeing it in theaters the first time, and thinking it was a very well-crafted, refreshing piece of filmmaking. But watching it on the small screen for the second time, I began to notice flaws that really distracted me from appreciating the details/style. \n\nThe problem I have with Baby Driver is the characters. At first, I thought it was strange that the character I related to the most was Buddy, played by Jon Hamm. This is because Buddy was the only three dimensional character in this movie. You understood his relationship with Darling through hints of Buddy's past. You understood his anger when Darling was killed. \n\nWhich makes the central relationship in the movie between Baby and Debora (and by extension, his mom) feel extremely superficial and fake. \n\nLet's start with Baby. It's almost as if Wright the screenwriter is checking off all the boxes that would make this character likable: Dead parents? Check. Disability? Check. One redemptive skill? Check. Relationship with elderly, black and deaf character whose only purpose for existing is to illustrate Baby's good heart? Check. Towards the end, there is literally a courtroom scene, where different characters look into the camera and tell the jury (the audience), why none of this was Baby's fault. He was forced to. He had no choice. He gave me back my purse while driving away from the crime scene. \n\nNext is the relationship between Debora and Baby. Their first conversation at the diner was extremely cringeworthy upon second viewing. It reads like a teenage boy's rehearsal in his head of how a conversation with a girl *should* play out. There's also no explaining why Debora would drop everything and put herself in mortal danger for Baby. This plays like an extremely unrealistic and 2D male fantasy (and I'm a dude saying this). She waits for him to get out of jail because....why? Because the story needs them to, that's why. \n\nFinally, the relationship between Doc and Baby. Which scene is more telling of Doc's character? The fact that he has a nephew who also likes music, or the fact that he threatened to kill Debora if Baby didn't continue to drive for him? If the answer is the latter, then Doc's sacrifice in the third act doesn't make any f**king sense.\n\nI was surprised by these issues, because I know Wright is capable of writing good, fleshed out characters like in the Cornetto trilogy. I think in the case of Scott Pilgrim and Baby Driver, the \"style\" became the main attraction, and it came at the expense of substance. It also leads me to conclude that Simon Pegg is an extremely underrated actor and screen presence, since him and Nick Frost seem to be the missing ingredients in both Scott Pilgrim and Baby Driver. I wouldn't be surprised if his career follows the route of Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love.\n\nAnyway, those are just my thoughts. I wonder if a reevaluation needs to be done on Baby Driver now that all the fanboy hype has died down. ",

It seems reasonable that someone like Armando Ianucci could have been on the receiving end of these complaints in the past considering his constant offensiveness to both sides of the aisle (in Veep and elsewhere.)    The scene when the central committee was voting on courses of action after Stalin's death especially struck me.  The whole central committee (or whatever USSR political entity they were) including the leader Malenkov (Tambor) would timidly half raise their hands when considering a vote. Once they noticed that the motion would be carried they all raised their hands and Malenkov would declare a false \"consensus.\"  This scene seemed just too appropriate a statement on the state of American (in particular Hollywood) politics to exist in merely a comedic vacuum.

        "text": "\nI look forward to the shorts every year. I rarely see them outside of this occasion, but like short stories, they’re a great reminder of how the medium can be tweaked and tailored to tell a different type of story, or to accentuate a different type of impact. I thought all five films were excellent this year: Dekalb Elementary, the Silent Child, My Nephew Emmet, The Eleven O’clock, and Watu Wote (All Of Us). I just wanted to open up a place for anybody that might want to share their thoughts on these films or short films in general.\n\n\nDekalb Elementary - I cringed at the beginning of this. It’s hard not be filled with dread when you see the boy pull out the gun, especially in light of current events, but I was also afraid I was about to watch a brutal film that amounted to little more than brutal tragedy porn. I was pleasantly surprised to find the story turn to focus not on a kid that wants to be a murderer, but a kid that wants to feel right. During the film’s conflict, the emotions are pretty subdued--shut down, in different ways--but you feel it leak through. I found it very powerful; even when you see that everything should be alright, you can still imagine myriad ways for things to go wrong: the kid changes his mind, suicide, the woman gets hurt, the kid gets hurt, etc. At the end, the woman is safe and finally lets herself breakdown. Ultimately, it was a simple little film but I found it captivating and powerful and really moving.\n\n\nThe Silent Child - A very well made film: I think it pretty much won the oscar based on its technical merits more than anything. It also helps that the deaf girl is absolutely adorable. However, for me, it stuck out the most because it felt the least realized of the collection. While multiple films here had a tag at the end to really hit it’s message home, in this case, it felt like the tag that deaf children are usually improperly supported was meant to justify the entire film. I still liked it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this was an abbreviated version of a full-length script, similar to how Whiplash used its short film to get the funding for a feature. But while Whiplash’s short did a good job of tapping into a powerful scene, Silent Child mostly just felt truncated. \n\n\nMy Nephew Emmet - As an American, this look at the country’s history of violent racism was fairly simple but powerful nonetheless. The shots were particularly beautiful as the characters stand cloaked in shadow and natural light. However, the tag at the end--revealing the true story it was based on--it doesn’t  add extra weight to the short film so much as it feels like an attempt to validate it, when the story did a good job of validating itself.\n\n\nThe Eleven O’Clock - kind of a throwback comedy with an Oscar Wilde or Tom Stoppard flair for dizzying dialogue and organized chaos. I really enjoyed it. It gave the collection some much needed levity. I heard a few people criticising it afterwards, saying that they “saw it coming from a mile away.” I did too (although I thought there was plenty of room for doubt) but, regardless, it was clever enough that knowing the twist doesn’t dampen the fun but should only elevate it.\n\n\nWatu Wote - Perhaps my favorite of the collection. It felt both technically impressive and told a very complete and powerful story. \n\n\nI missed the shorts last year for the first time in a while. This year’s collection I found to be very impressive. I enjoyed all of them immensely. I hope to see more from all the filmmakers involved. As always, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "**If you don't want to read the whole wall of text below (longer than I intended), just skip to the questions at the end in bold.**\n\nThree films I've seen recently give a central role to smart phones and/or social media. They are *Loveless* (Andrey Zvyagintsev 2018), *Happy End* (Michael Haneke 2017), and *Personal Shopper* (Olivier Assayas 2016). \n\nThe first two - *Loveless* and *Happy End* - are characterised by a deeply cold and depressing view of society. Furthermore, it seems like social media has a central role to play in this depressing world view. In both films characters phones and laptops sever bonds with family and society - they actively inhibit love. \n\nIn *Happy End* a young girl is hiding a quite horrifying persona from her parents, who have absolutely no clue as to how her mind and heart are warping in the darkest of directions. Meanwhile her Father is distracted by a similarly dark online affair - one that his daughter is tech savvy enough to become exposed to. It's basically layer upon layer of irriversable emotional damage (yeh I know - that cheerful old joker Haneke strikes again). \n\nIn *Loveless* a child's parents sit swiping away at their phones for entire evenings, completely unaware (or do they just not care?) that in the next room their son is the unhappiest boy in all of Russia. Given the film's narrative, the adult's fascination with technology looks bad. It's not a positive portrayal of this aspect of their lives. \n\nThe films differ in that while Haneke allows us to enter the online world of the characters, actually filling the screen with a phone or computer screen so we can follow the (terrifying) communication taking place, Zvyagintsev simply films people looking at their phones. We don't know what they're doing (except swiping) - they are are physically inert. \n\nIn *Personal Shopper*, Assayas chooses a route somewhere in between my first two examples, splitting our attention between watching a character staring at her phone, and at other times allowing us to see what she sees; sharing her online activity with the audience. He doesn't simply *use* the phone screen as his film screen (as Haneke does), but closely *films* the phone screen (close enough for us to see what's happening on it) in addition to filming the character looking at her phone screen. \n\n*Personal Shopper* is different in its attitude to social media also, attempting (I *think*) less of a judgemental attitude, and genuinely trying to create a movie language that embraces the nature of contemporary communication; using it to progress his narrative (although this is complicated by the fact that we're not sure if Stewart is chatting to a person or a ghost!). This is typical of Assayas's recent work that I feel has attempted to suggest a less hysterical, more positive attitude to the role of technology in people's lives, and its effect of human society. \n\n**Two questions:** \n\n**How do film makers who want to create contemporary stories practically tackle the increasingly ubiquitous human activity of interracting with others via social media, either on laptops or phones? The recent Assayas film *Personal Shopper* came in for a lot of criticism for the amount of screen time he devoted to Kristen Stewart staring at her phone. Even though the audience were witness to her online chats, there was a popular opinion that these scenes were simply tedious to watch. Do smartphones herald the death of a certain kind of active human interraction? Has anyone seen a film where this problem is overcome - where online communication is a truly engaging, energetic driving force within the narrative?**\n\n**Secondly, films such as *Loveless* and *Happy End* take an overwhelmingly depressing view of social media, creating worlds in which technology is a destructive influence on positive, meaningful relations between human beings. An older generation will probably connect to this view - similarly to Haneke and Zvyagintsev, they grew up in a world without social media (hell - Haneke grew up in a world without TV!). But for a younger audience - how do you respond to this portrayal of your world? Have you seen examples of films where a significant part of character's communication is virtual, and it's just *OK*? I mean where it's not in one way or another the end of the world?**",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis question is more geared for those with an interest in Italian cinema! I could probably research this but I thought a discussion might be interesting for /r/Truefilm. \n\nWhy do you think (or just factually) did Italian cinema decline in fame, quality and popularity in contrast to British or Hollywood productions, or has it at all? The contrast between today and the gden age of Cinecittà and the great directors (De Sica, Fellini, Visconti just to name the big three) is incredible - any particular insight into why this might be and the reasons for it?\n\nI know it's quite vague and niche, but I'm sure there will be some interesting comments. Maybe it has not died at all, and Italian cinema is alive and well, with big name releases such as The Great Beauty or the lesser known Don't Be Bad (non essere cattivo - 2015). Directors such as Paolo Sorrentino are also greats, and it's sad not to see them get as much recognition as those who work in the English language, but this will always be how it is for obvious reasons. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your ideas.",

        "text": "GDT is such a masterful director that I had to spend a lot of time thinking about the movie to realize that I don't think I cared for it at all. The more I tried to reach out and grasp, the less I could get my hands around anything.\n\nOther analyses and reviews use phrases like \"a beautiful movie about loneliness\" and so forth, but don't seem to have much to add beyond that. I'll try to dig a little bit into the mechanics of how the movie works, and why I didn't care for them.\n\nThe first thing I started to notice is how GDT establishes a bond between Elisa and The Asset. The core of the mechanic is that neither of them can speak. The Asset is also metaphorically voiceless - he has no one to represent his interests. This is a clever way to symbolically join them together, but it's also _wrong_. Elisa can speak, she just can't use her voicebox. \n\nThe Asset is a non-human creature with a humanoid shape that presumably has no capacity for language beyond the basic signing capability of an animal like Koko. Its body language may elicit feelings of sympathy because we read so much from human-shape body language, but we also read a lot from dog body-language. For all we know, The Asset is one of the fishmen from Alan Moore's Neonomicon, easily manipulating Elisa's emotions to impregnate her with Cthulhu.\n\nMy point is: it's gross that we are led to believe Elisa and The Asset are a natural love match because she can't make sounds come out of her throat, and neither can he. \n\nFrom there it's easy to see how gross it is that that suffering of gay people, black people, and women, are equated with the suffering of a non-human fishman. Each of those characters is shown to sympathize with The Asset because of their own oppression and suffering as a result of marginalization or oppression of some sort. But they are humans, and The Asset is not human. The conflation is insulting, to say the least.\n\nFinally I began to look at the symbolism. Water symbolically represents chaos, or inchoate potential. We come out of the water, we don't go back into it. In sort of a reverse baptism, Elisa returns to the water, unborn again, now voiceless in an animal way, because her lover can't speak to her. It just wants her eggs. It's a call for a dissolution of categories, of boundaries that separate people, even of the boundaries that separate human from animal. Fuck a fish if you want to, if you're lonely enough.\n\nThis then brings the cartoonish character of the villains into stark relief. Countries are just more boundaries that separate people and cause good people to die. Authority and leadership are just guises for authoritarianism and abuse of power. Any hierarchy is bad hierarchy. The American Dream of a beautiful wife, two kids, and a house is a sham, a hiding place for the perverse and wicked.\n\nAll these categories, boundaries, and hierarchies are bad, and should be dissolved back into the water from whence they came.\n\nThe problem with this kind of thinking is that it's so obtuse. Of course gay people, black people, and women should be treated like equals. That doesn't mean that all the systems that we've created to deal with the complexity of reality are inherently bad. Dissolving all the categories doesn't solve problems, it brings back all the problems that we started with and created many of the categories to deal with in the first place. It confuses bad categories with all categories.\n\nWe aren't going back to the water.\n\nThoughts?",

The filmmaker can decide the “range of knowledge” that he provides to the spectator by having a film unspool through “omniscient or unrestricted narration” where the audience sees and knows more than its characters (Bordwell and Thompson 87-88). Conversely, the filmmaker can present story information through specific characters, show us only what they see and hear, which is termed “restricted narration” (Bordwell and Thompson 87-88). \n\nBordwell and Thompson point out that films oscillate between restricted and unrestricted narration (Bordwell and Thompson 88). They further add that the filmmaker can also make choices regarding the “depth of knowledge” that he/she provides the spectator with (Bordwell and Thompson 90). If the audience only sees and hears what a particular character sees or hears, the character and through him the spectator, has what Bordwell and Thompson call “perceptual subjectivity”(Bordwell and Thompson 90-91). On other occasions, the director can choose to take us deeper into the psyche of the character and open up his mind, which Bordwell and Thompson term, “mental subjectivity”(Bordwell and Thompson 91). Hugo Munsterberg in his essay, “Why We Go to the Movies” wrote about how cinema as a medium could be used to express and interpret complex psychological states (Munsterberg 16). As he puts it, “photoplay” can transform the world around a person in any way to express the deepest emotions and mental states that cannot be expressed with just a face or a body (Munsterberg 16).",

        "text": "Hello! I recently rewatched the movie \"Yi Yi\" by Edward Yang, a Taiwanese family drama, in which each family member is going through individual struggles in dealing with life. (If you haven't watched, highly recommend). \n\n\nDuring the movie, one of the characters says, \"没有一朵云，没有一棵树，是不美丽的。所以人也应该这样。\" or \"There are no clouds, no trees, it isn't beautiful. People should be like this too.\" I'm very confused about this. I understand that it's a metaphor, and that in Chinese it's common to use negatives to amplify the effect of the reverse, and thus he means clouds and trees are beautiful. But I'm drawing a blank on \"the thing that people should be like\". \n\n\n I also asked a Chinese coworker, who said, \"these things like trees and clouds are common, but still beautiful. So the characters in the movie, who are just common people, can still live beautiful lives.\" \n\n\nHowever, I'm still sort of confused about how the \"but still\" part is implied in this sentence. It'd be great if I could hear other peoples' interpretations of what this quote means. I'm guessing the power of the quote lies in the ambiguity of the first sentence and how many ways you can interpret it, but I'm confused about how this fits in the context of the movie. \n\n\nIf anyone can provide a more detailed, step-by-step explanation about how \"没有一朵云，没有一棵树，是不美丽的。\" becomes \"trees and clouds are common, but still beautiful\", or any other interpretation of this entire quote you might have, I will be eternally grateful! I just really want to fully understand one of my favorite movies :)\n\n\nI also posted this in the ChineseLanguage subreddit because I believe the quote requires a background in interpretation of Chinese prose, so if anyone with this background could also provide an explanation, that would be awesome :)\n\n\nEdit: I just realized i was reading the subtitles wrong. the subtitles were \"There is no cloud...\", next line, \"There is no tree...\", next line, \"...That is not beautiful\". I realized I was reading it as \"There is no cloud. There is no tree. **That** is not beautiful.\" It seemed extremely abstract at first. Instead I should have been reading it as \"There is no cloud/tree that is not beautiful.\" I'm a dummy haha thank you everyone for your help!",

        "text": "*Pure Flix* is a bunch of trash and Kirk Cameron’s movies are crap; Christian cinema is a profitable industry with a low quality. So the question is “why?”\n\nIt would be really easy to say that Christians are dumb, and don’t know the euphoria of being enlighten not because of any phony god's blessings but by your own cinematography. But that is a ridiculous answer. Christian art has produced over the centuries some of the most remarkable magnum opus in every area (Painting, sculpture, architecture, music). Even some decades ago Christian movies were being made with great quality, with classics like *Ben-Hur* being celebrated as masterpieces.\n\n* [What happened to you man? You used to be cool](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBqN-WKWMAA99HX.jpg)\n\nSo, what happened?\n\n###**Part 1: “Movies as a form worship” or “Side hug the movie for Jesus”**\n\n*“And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men”*\n\n-*Colossians 3:23*\n\nCurrently Christian Cinema exist outside Hollywood, it’s not really part of the mainstream movie industry. As such it operates by its own rules, and its rules always put Jesus first, second and third. They are written as a sermon with the story being accessory to it.\n\n* [Jesus man!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTLlzHyfyS8)\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that as long as the “message” is good by the religious community’s standards then the quality of the movie is secondary. These films’ audience sees watching them not as a simple form of entertainment, but as a form of worship or even a religious duty. You need to watch this things and show them to your friends because that’s what Jesus wants to.\n\nWhen audiences have low standards and will be there regardless of quality, it’s not really necessary to put any meaningful effort on making the movie. Mediocrity is, after all, very cheap.\n\n* [It’s lamer than it looks.](https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/kirk-cameron-saving-christmas.jpg?w=450)\n\nBut this has not always being the case. There is something that makes the current Christian Movies’ audience susceptible to this kind of product while in the pass mainstream religious films were subject to higher standards.\n\nTo explain what this is, I will point to one recently made Christian movie that I can honestly call “good”, and that is the 2015 Italian-Argentinian film *Chiamatemi Francesco* (*Call Me Francis*). It’s not a masterpiece but I can confidently say that it’s a properly made movie with a Christian message. But there is something that separates *Chiamatemi Francesco* from movies like *God is not dead*; and that is *Chiamatemi Francesco* is a catholic movie.\n\n###**Part 2: “The culture of Evangelical Protestantism” or “Big MacChrist and order of fries”**\n\n*\"Blessed are the hypocrites, for theirs is the kingdom of Earth.\"*\n\n-*Andrés Caicedo*\n\nReligion is a product of the context where it is born. Gustavo Bueno called Catholicism an “heir of Roman law and Greek philosophy”, Max Weber saw Protestant Ethic and the Reformation as the birth of capitalism as we know it. With the same logic one must see the current post-Azusa Street Revival evangelical Protestantism as a genuinely US product, for better or (usually) for worst.\n\n* [It’s meaningful that they are called Megachurches rather than cathedrals](https://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-547110672-1280x720.jpg)\n\nIt is culturally dead basically. It is Christianity reduced to the worst aspects of mass produced media and franchising. And it’s heavily radicalized, the people who belong to this brand of Christianity usually make it the entire center of their existence, everything revolves around it to the point that anything outside the church becomes frightening.\n\nThis explains a lot about the common characteristics of Christian Cinema: its persecutory delusions, its necessity to preach to the choir, and its lack of quality. Their audiences think they are being persecuted because as the secular world is a menace simply by virtue of being majority, the audience need to be reaffirmed on their believe that they are right because that gives them comfort in a world they see as hostile, and they don’t need quality because for a lot of them these are the only movies they will consume anyway.\n\n* [If you don’t have to compete with the secular version…](https://pics.filmaffinity.com/sunday_school_musical-361009141-large.jpg)\n\nThe problem with Christian Cinema is ultimately that it is not really Christian, it is US Evangelical Protestantism™. And that’s not something that can be fixed.",

        "text": "There has been a lot of discussion of this film on this sub and elsewhere, but the reason I want to get into it again is because I have yet to see a cohesive explanation of the central themes and ideas laid out. Also I feel that the film has been much maligned, often misread and completely misunderstood by a lot of its detractors. \n\nOne of the reasons I believe it has been misinterpreted is because one of its principle selling points was being a social-issues drama about police-racism and corruption, which is a feint the movie makes before it swerves, telling a more personal and nuanced story. The movie pretends to be about a heroic, plucky woman facing an incompetent and racist establishment, but the film quickly subverts the conventional David vs. Goliath premise. What becomes apparent is that Mildred Hayes is being unfair to the police, who really do care about solving the murder. She is channeling her grief, and through it her rage and hatred, into a PR campaign against a man dying of cancer.\n\n**(1) Forgiveness**\n\nThe obvious thematic core of *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri* is that you need to let go of your rage and hate, because they are festering wounds inside you, totally destructive forces that can consume you. Chief Willoughby even lays this out explicitly in his letter to Dixon- “as long as you hold on to so much hate, then I don't think you're ever going to become, what I know you want to become.” You can knock the film for being too obvious here, and yet almost every attack on the film seems like it has totally missed this point. \n\nThe film posits forgiveness as a counterpoint to rage. We see this when Red finds Dixon burned, next to him in the hospital and chooses to show him kindness, despite all the man has done. This is why I find the whole idea of “redeeming Dixon’s character” as a ludicrous criticism. McDonagh posits that forgiveness is something you do most importantly because holding on to your hatred makes you suffer first and foremost. But also you forgive people not for having “redeemed themselves” i.e. made up for what they’ve done, but because at the most basic level they are a human-being, which inherently makes them worthy of compassion, and in forgiving them you give them a chance to be a better person. We see this happen to Mildred when she’s at the restaurant and her husband is there, and she’s about to smash him with a champagne bottle because she learns he burned her billboards, but in the end after contemplating all the violence she has wrought she decides against it. McDonagh draws heavily from his Catholicism in his work, and *Three Billboards* is no exception. The characters are trapped in a cycle of violence, maintaining it with their misplaced grief, and the Catholic idea of unconditional forgiveness is the only path to healing.\n\n**(2) Justice**\n\nIf unconditional forgiveness is one core idea of the film, the other is the elusiveness of justice. Again and again in the film we have the ideas of proof and how we discern guilt upended and deconstructed. In the beginning when we still believe the righteousness of Mildred’s cause and she speaks with Chief Willoughby she keeps telling him that they should take blood samples from everyone in the state, or everyone in the country, obviously completely unconstitutional proposals as he points out. The case itself has no eyewitnesses. When there are witnesses we keep being presented with this idea of “his word against yours.” We hear this with Mildred’s account of domestic abuse, and the episode with the dentist. It is alluded to with the story of Dixon’s alleged torture of a black person. One of the funny things about the criticisms of the handling of Dixon’s character is how they assume he actually did torture a black person like he’s been rumored to. But what evidence do we really have? We’re introduced to him using a racial slur, and he’s the “villain” of the film’s first half. But when he’s talking with his mom about how times have changed regarding race in the south, he actually doesn’t seem upset about it. In the whole “person-of-color-torture-business” exchange it’s really unclear whether he’s mocking the term or sincerely using it. He does arrest Mildred’s black friend for a trumped-up drug charge, but it seems like a personally motivated act of revenge rather than one of racial bigotry. We take this circumstantial, flimsy evidence, we take what we know about police in the current political climate, and make assumptions about what he has done. One remarkable part of the film for me was how when he threw Red out the window I thought “well he must’ve tortured that guy,” but later when he’s trying to solve the murder I thought “I don’t think he did it.” We mentally convict Dixon again when it cuts from his mom advising him, to the billboards burning, we think: he must’ve have done it. Again the film overturns our expectations of culpability.\n\nThese ideas of proof and evidence culminate with the scene where Dixon overhears the man in the bar talking about some girl he might have raped and burned. Once again we take this circumstantial, out-of-context snippet of conversation as evidence, and in the end the real evidence exculpates the man. The movie is asking us- how can we be sure of anything? How can we truly find justice?\n\n**(3) *Three Billboards*’s Conclusions**\n\nThe way the film synthesizes its two themes is in its answer, again in Willoughby’s letter to Dixon: “through love comes calm, and through calm comes thought. And you need thought to detect stuff sometimes.” The reason why love and forgiveness are so central to justice in McDonagh’s and the film’s worldview is because of human-beings’ inability to solve the evil in the world. Mildred’s misplaced grief leads her to put up the billboards, which on some psychological level she has assigned the role of bringing her daughter back. But her daughter can’t come back, and for Dixon neither can Chief Willoughby. They may never catch Mildred’s daughter’s killer. But the chief lays it out when he says maybe one day they’ll get lucky and catch the trail because of someone bragging in a barroom or a jail. It’s not to say that compassion and forgiveness are infallible tools for solving your problems. When Dixon finally performs a self-sacrificing act, by taking violence onto himself when he scratches the man in the bar (again very Catholic, this idea of martyrdom) he doesn’t solve the case, but instead learns that the man may have committed a wholly different crime against some other innocent woman. Because the world is not a fair place. When Mildred puts up the billboards it’s her son and her friend who suffer. When Dixon throws a man out of a window he doesn’t get arrested. Sometimes you contract incurable cancer. In the same way that the characters forgive one another to give each other a chance to be better, they must let go of rage, not because doing so automatically creates justice, but because it gives them a chance to pursue it, to repair the damaged world, calmly and with love in their hearts.\n",

        "text": "I just recently watched The Shape of Water and have been absorbing it ever since. Although I believe there is a lot to discuss about this film, I wanted to bring the attention solely to the protagonist in this film. \n\nI've been reading other general discussions on this movie and came to find that a lot of people interpreted Elisa to be half-amphibian herself. Guillermo Del Toro certainly adds details throughout the film that suggests she very well could be, but I personally didn't interpret these additions to be that way. I think it's important to explore this theme as it certainly adds perception and a new layer of understanding between the romantic language of Elisa and The Asset. \n\nSome of the interpretive indicators within the film that point Elisa towards being partial amphibian is that at the beginning of the film we understand her to be having an underwater dream, Elisa was found alone by the river, the scars on her neck which resemble gills and the final act of the film.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, I didn't interpret this to be a direct association to Elisa being of the same species as The Asset, but rather as a factor which highlights the fine line of Elisa being treated more warmly over The Asset purely due to her appearance. I believe that the story is telling us, human or half amphibian these two characters experienced similarities in life, and this is not expressed solely through the two characters being inadequate in vocal linguistics, but actually through these several indications. \n\nI think perhaps Elisa's sign language is being highlighted way too much between the relationship as throughout the film the two characters bond much more through sheer body language. I think this is important to mention as it adds more value to the organic bond that these two characters have.\n\nRegarding the ending, I interpreted this to be a visual representation of what Giles actually wanted to believe, I didn't see this to be an actual transformation of Elisa. I think this was a very fitting end to the film as it didn't completely solidify what had occurred beyond, leaving the relationship to be a fantasy. \n\nWhat did you guys make of it? ",

        "text": "Hello everybody. First post here actually.\n\nSo I just saw Vertigo today for the first time in a film studies lesson. I really really enjoyed it and I think I 'got it' so to speak. But what was so interesting to me is the fact that it really messed with my head but not in the conventional way that it does with most people or in the way that was intended.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that it totally went against what I expected it to be like in an amazing fashion. What I knew beforehand was that it was a psychological mystery with James Stewart as a detective suffering from vertigo and I had seen some stills/clips of the most famous bits. That movie I was expecting basically ended two thirds of the way through (with the suicide scene) to reveal something so much more interesting. I could have never predicted that Vertigo was really a grand statement about the obsession that comes with love and trying to re-create the past rather than just a very solid Hitchcock thriller. And then my previous expectations linked with these ideas in such an interesting way with my idealistic expectations going in becoming similar to Scotty's own idealistic view of his initial time spent with Madeleine, with both ultimately being false in some way. Just in general, I found the idea that the movie starts and ends twice with the second half being a refection on the first so incredible. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before and that is an especially amazing feat for a movie from 1958.\n\nHope I managed to explain that clearly and didn't get too artsy fartsy with it. It's just a very interesting dynamic going back to old classics with modern ideas of what they 'should' be that can end up creating interesting new responses. Just wanted to share that :)",

My main issue with the film revolves around what I believ, to be fundamental to filmmaking, good storytelling. &amp;nbsp;\n\nTo me, the love between fishman and Elisa felt extremely rushed. One moment she's feeding lil mama some hardboiled eggs, next they smashing and causing property damage. It seemed that the only connection they had was their marginalized identities and love for eggs, which made it extremely difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. I recall thinking \"there's no way they're actually in love\" quite a few times throughout the movie. Am I a speciest? Perhaps, but Beauty and The Beast did essentially the same thing but better. &amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the other hand what this movie did extremely well was Strickland's subplot. Weaving in his ignorance in an elegant way to make it obvious it was a core part of his identity. Unfortunately, his character was ruined by some strange plotholes that all felt a little too ridiculous. &amp;nbsp;\n\nCinematography? 10 &amp;nbsp;\n\nSoundtrack? 10&amp;nbsp;\n\nActing? 10&amp;nbsp;\n\nI genuinely feel like I'm watching this movie wrong.

I can understand modern cinema showing them as fair and even pale since much of the Italian Americans nowadays either have Germanic or Celtic blood or are immigrants from the wealthier Italian regions (or of middle class origin).\n\nHowever even old movies from the 30s-50s, when racism against specific nationalities of white immigrants was still a thing, show them as fair skin. Even the stereotype of Italians being (by white standards) dark skin still lasted into the 70s. Yet much of the most popular flicks revolving around Italians or Italian Americans such as Rocky show them as milky white as your average American (especially Sylvester Stallone who is really of Italian descent). Even films that show Italian stereotypes such as The Godfather tended to portray them considerably lighter skinned than stereotypes at the time.\n\nWhy did this phenomenon occur in cinema despite Italians being portrayed as dark and borderline nonwhite in American bias at the time (and heck even Western Europeans saw them as lowly whites especially Anglo Saxon and Germanic nations)? I mean Hollywood stereotyped much of the Spaniards, Portuguese, and such as olive skin (with much of the same stereotypes as Italians in the early 20th century).\n\nSo why did Italians break away from this stigma in popular movies?",

        "text": "Although this movie was released last year, it has only just come out in Australia. I saw it yesterday and thought that overall it was fantastic and had some great scenes as well as daring social critique. I am hoping for this thread to be a discussion of some of the ideas in the movie, feel free to put your own views below. I will be addressing my thought by theme (as I see them):\n\nHelping others\n\nRefugees and migration have become a heavily politicised topic all over the \"developed\" world ( I put this in quotes because I don't like the term developed. Have we really topped out at out point of development? I think we have a long way to go but that is a discussion for another time.). Sweden took in many refugees during the refugee crisis and it is my understanding that their is a desire amongst some of the population to take in more. While a very noble goal in itself, the movie on multiple occasions contrasted the woman petitioning others to \"help save a life\" with the seemingly large homeless problem that exists around Stockholm. The implication seemed to be that there is an awful lot of emphasis placed on helping people from far away while many of the Swedes fellow citizens have no homes, no prospects and awful lives. You don't need to look overseas for people to help, there are many who desperately need your help right here and now. Being from Australia this idea hit pretty hard in the theatre I saw this movie as we are currently having a somewhat similar debate over refugess (with many being sanctimonious about how we must take them) while at the same time are having a huge drug crisis as more and more (generally working class) Australians are using ice.\n\nThis critique (which I think is valid and not taken seriously enough by many well-meaning people) was then brilliantly complicated by a scene in a large shopping mall. Christian (the lead) had multiple bags of shopping from different stores but had lost track of his daughters. He wanted someone to watch his shopping while he looked for them. He asked many Swedes for help and was completely ignored. Eventually he asked for the help from a muslim refugee beggar (the man had previously asked Christian for money and was praying when Christian interrupted him) who happily complied despite a language barrier. We later see Christian entering his office with his daughters and all of his shopping. The destitute man had not robbed him and had been the only one willing to help him on a human level when required. This further reinforced the idea that people are willing to help people from far away for abstract (perhaps performative) reasons, but unwilling to help the man or woman next door.\n\nThe abuse of power in relation to women\n\nThere was a couple of brilliantly contrasting scenes relating to the way powerful men relate to women and what is and isn't seen as acceptable behaviour. In one scene, an actor as part of a performative art performance acts like an ape in a high society dinner. Watch the full scene here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvvNVQdnQtc) It is a fantastic bit of acting, film direction and social commentary in general. After watching it I felt a great sense of satisfaction in seeing the more primal man beaten to death (by implication) by a high society crowd. (One of) the messages of this scene is that the use of male physical power to dominate women is not acceptable, especially so when used for sexual goals.\n\nHowever, this contrasts with another earlier scene in the movie where Christian has a one night stand with an American interviewer. He clearly sees it as a one time thing while she seems more interested in him for something more. They have an argument where she says that she thinks he uses his power and status as the museum curator in order to sleep with women. She was clearly upset by the way their interaction had turned out. Christian gets her to admit that she was primarily interested in him for his occupation and status rather than who he actually was. When contrasted with the ape scene, this raises some interesting questions. Was the abuse of power by the apeman any worse than the abuse of power by Christian? Both situations left the woman in the scenario feeling somewhat traumatised or devalued, but the first example got a far more visceral emotional reaction from me as I watched the film. I don't know where I stand on the question overall, but it gave me a lot to think about. \n\nEDIT: Considering the Harvey Weinstein/Hollywood scandal and subsequent outcry this question of abuse of power becomes even more interesting.\n\nThere is a lot more in this movie and I would highly recommend you see it. I might add to this post later on, when I return from work.",

        "text": "I’ll give you the TL;DR first: **help me prove my uber-film snob of a friend wrong**\n\nWhen I use the term “film snob” on myself and most others, I say it with a kind of endearment and often a mark of pride in appreciating art without crossing into douchebag territory. Like most people here, I really enjoy discussing great filmmaking as an art form with others while still going to see the occasional popcorn flick with my friends who’d much rather turn off their brains and just enjoy the ride. I feel lucky to have people in my life who enjoy doing both of these things as well.\n\nThen there’s Dave. \n\nDave is a film snob in the most derogatory sense of the word. Dave isn’t a douche-bag per se—he’s actually quite an amiable fella in normal circumstances—but if you were to meet Dave in the middle of a conversation about film, you would very likely draw that conclusion that he is, in fact, a bag of douches. He becomes arrogant about his hobby, claiming to only watch “true cinema” and rarely does anything made past 1985 make the cut. I can’t for the life of me get Dave to see anything “modern” (as he puts it) and when I do I get to sit through two hours of eye rolling and sighs accompanied by a lecture of every little thing that was wrong with the film once we leave the theater. Our last instance of this was when we went to see *Dunkirk* and AT BEST he expressed an appreciation that the movie was filmed on actual film instead of digital, because digital is garbage.\n\n“Garbage” is one of his favorite adjectives, by the way.\n\nSo I got into an argument with him the other day about creativity in filmmaking, to which his counter is “there is none. Mainstream film is crap, and even independent cinema is garbage.” I asked him what independent films he’s seen recently, to which he replied none. I then argued that he can’t pass judgement on something he’s never seen, and doing so keeps him from discovering new talent and creative vision. \n\n*He actually fucking scoffed at me.* Like he should have been wearing a monocle at that moment.\n\n“*What* new talent and creative vision? It doesn’t exist. Everyone’s just copying the greats that came before them.”\n\nI pointed out that it’s called having influences, and every artist has had them since forever, including his beloved Paul Thomas Anderson (one of the few modern day filmmakers he will watch). That doesn’t mean people can’t find new and entirely different ways to express their vision in film. To which he looked at me seriously and said, “make me a list and I’ll watch it. If anyone can convince me otherwise it’s you.” \n\nCompliment and challenge accepted.\n\nSo long story short, I’m here for some help. The list I’m putting together has only one criteria really: it must have been made in the past ten years. The more unique/creative, the better. \n\nHere’s what I’ve come up with so far:\n\n1) *Beasts of the Southern Wild* - gorgeous cinematography using small amounts of magical realism. The script as well.\n\n2) *Whiplash* - mostly because of the editing but it’s also just a movie I love.\n\n3) *Only Lovers Left Alive* - cheating because Jarmusch has been around forever, but I love the atmosphere of this film and it’s spin on “vampire romance”\n\n4) *Ex Machina* - great take on “what does it mean to be human” and excellent special effects.\n\n(I’m also considering throwing *Swiss Army Man* in there just to screw with him)\n\nThat’s all I have so far but I get the feeling that my list is still a bit too mainstream.

        "text": "[The Feel-Good Fallacies of “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-feel-good-fallacies-of-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri)\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't seen this film but have seen his prior two (*Seven Psychopaths* and *In Bruges*).\n\nBased on those two films and reading up on the director/writer's bio I'm going to make broad, sweeping generalizations about him that you can in turn mock me for, or entirely dismiss (hey, I'm honest...)\n\n*Seven Psychopaths* and *In Bruges* appear to be original in a sea of cookie-cutter films, but are rather unoriginal and unmemorable in every way.  What I mean by that is that they seem to be written with a checklist in mind.  The writer-director has imagined some sort of clever climax and ending, and then set out to write a bunch of filler that leads up to that moment.  The filler can be jammed full of hollow stereotypes to make art-ignorant studio execs happy. \n\n\"Overly emotional hitman, I'm thinking Colin Ferrell\"\n\n\"Eccentric criminal/gangster, for this we need Christopher Walken, and it's a satire within a satire!\"\n\nThese films are like comparing novel proposals written to agents and publishers to the novels themselves.  The former is easy to write, everyone with knowledge of the right strings to pull in the reader could write one. Pulling off the latter is another matter entirely.\n\n[This article](http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Li-Pr/McDonagh-Martin.html) notes McDonagh's specific influences being Nabokov and Borges.  I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this apparently wiki-fied bio, however silly that statement may seem.  Assuming that information is true, I think there is something to be drawn from it.\n\nPeople throw around criticism of modernism and post-modernism without understanding what they actually *are*.  I would argue that what they *represent*, which is the point of this post, is ultimately a narcissistic view of the world.  \n\nModernism was a rejection of the culture of the past, an attempt to redefine everything that might slow down humanity's triumphant march into the Future^tm. Of course, it isn't that simple. If post-modernism is actually a thing (arguable), it is hardly a complete departure from modernism, in that modernism effectively erased prior ideas as irrelevant, and post-modernism does not attempt to dispute that notion.  It simply argues that if modernism didn't find the answers to all questions, the answers (and perhaps even the questions) don't really exist.\n\nThese ideas are all sold under the banner of speaking up for caricatures of imagined people who can find a reason to criticize all culture of the past in some way.  But at the end of the day what that boils down to is a glorification of the critic, just for criticism's sake. Politics aside, there's a reason why generations of teenagers identify with Kurt Vonnegut. To a sheltered people who have no connection to their past or their future, narcissistic irony makes a lot of sense. You can offhandedly joke about the fire bombing of Dresden if it has nothing to do with you, because you erased your involvement in that past, and are criticizing your present to ensure that you have little responsibility for your future, either.  \n\nThe catch with that mentality is that it leaves you devoid of any cultural tradition and real human experience.  And so your stories become haphazard plagiarisms of others, lacking coherent plot, but rather organized around your 'theme'. The 'theme' of course can be whatever you like.  In McDonagh's case it can be the the emotional Jason Bourne, or the eccentric gangster of *Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead* (complete with the same actor to fully embrace the above mentioned plagiarism). If cultures of the past don't matter, the characters he rehashes from other films logically do not exist, do they?  So he didn't really lack any artistic merit of his own when he wrote those rehashed plots and characters, he got the theme worked in there and that's all that counts.\n\nBorges endorsed so many failed and murderous ideologues in his lifetime that he retreated to Switzerland to die in exile from his own country.  According to his [sister](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n09/colm-toibin/dont-abandon-me) he was positively obsessed with winning a Nobel prize, and considered every failure to do so a personal tragedy.  While Nabokov may or may not have been as personally narcissistic, he did manage to identify and channel American narcissism  quite effectively in his most prolific novel, *Lolita*. The shocking plot is what caused the novel to sell so well, but any literature professor will tell you that it's not about the plot it's about the 'themes'. After all, the author doesn't matter, it's the professor/critic/reader that really matters in the age of narcissism. The professor-critic doesn't mind that no one listens to his/her own opinions about why those 'themes' are so important, because the professor-critic isn't writing and lecturing for an audience, he/she is writing and lecturing for him or herself.\n\nAssuming those are in fact his literary influences, this sad state of affairs perfectly explains McDonagh.  His films  are trash to be watched once and thrown away just like everything else that high modernism shipped off to its landfills. Your house doesn't matter, it's to be sold for a meager profit so that you can buy a slightly larger one just like it.  The furniture in your house doesn't matter, when your unruly kids destroy it you throw it away and buy more from Ikea. Your car doesn't matter, if you wreck it while taking pictures of yourself in traffic with your phone, mom/dad/husband/wife/insurer will buy you another one. If you ask your boss, *you* don't matter. If he needs to make a quota he can fire you tomorrow but that's okay, you can live on credit cards until you find a new boss. The credit card company won't care that you are unable to pay the bill because you don't matter to them either, you're a credit on the ledger and that's all that counts. \n\nIn an existence that has managed to convince itself that nothing outside of itself matters, the only thing left to do is stare into that pool at your own reflection and contemplate your personal 'theme' until you die, just like Narcissus did.\n\nMaybe if McDonagh chose this for his next 'theme' he could make a film with more lasting impact than the ~2 hours it takes to sit through it.",

        "text": "This post references three tracks from the OST of Your Name. They are linked below\n\n* [*Date*](https://youtu.be/H9yfuYDoGf4?t=20m44s)\n* [*Theme of Mitsuha*](https://youtu.be/H9yfuYDoGf4?t=44m35s)  \n* [*Date 2*](https://youtu.be/H9yfuYDoGf4?t=1h1m11s)\n\n_______________________\n\nRecently I discovered Your Name (Kimi no Na wa.), the critically acclaimed Japanese animation movie from 2016. I’ve watched it a few times already, and like many people, I was impressed by the depth of the whole movie. I’ve spent a considerable amount of my past few days thinking about the movie [even when I probably shouldn’t be, like in work meetings…], and the various themes found in it. It’s been a very long time since a movie has left this kind of impression, and my on my first viewing [I went in completely blind knowing only that it was about two teenagers in Japan] I felt every jolt and G-force of the movie’s emotional rollercoaster. The twist in the middle completely carved out my insides and I was gripped by it more than anything I can remember at the moment. I found it difficult to get the movie out of my head, despite the (in my opinion) resolved ending [they live happily ever after - I refuse to accept another interpretation], and the fact that the events and setting in the movie have zero connection to my own life. Because of this, I watched it several times, and watched certain scenes again in isolation, in an attempt to get to the bottom of why I keep thinking about this movie.\n\nI wanted to share some thoughts that I’ve had about the movie, principally about the music. What struck me the most, particularly when watching isolated scenes, was the impact they had even without watching the movie as a whole. The ending scene, even when skipped right to it, carries all the weight it had of my first viewing, and the climax of the movie when Mitsuha is granted a second chance and carries out Taki’s plan was the same. For me, what carries the impact is the music.\n\nThe music itself is ultimately fine-tuned to perfection. I wasn’t at all surprised that the director (Makoto Shinkai) and the music composers (RADWIMPS) collaborated closely on it, with each party adjusting their own work to match the others. The J-Pop/Rock isn’t overdone like something like Tokyo Mirage Sessions, the instruments are well used, and as a result the music is multi-layered and gives a rendering to the movie’s heart and soul which balances the audio excellence with the visuals stemming from the best animation I think I’ve seen in an anime. Both Shinkai and RADWIMPS set new bars in filmmaking for all genres, not just the one for this film.\n\nWhat makes the film stand out to me is the way in which the focus and attention is placed on the two central characters, and the way in which their individual stories are actually the same story. You can’t tell one without the other. The fact that this thread runs consistently and implicitly through the film *thematically* before you even consider the explicit plot expositioning by Mitsuha’s Grandma is a testament to the storytelling and editing on its own. But deeper than that, the music draws attention to the characters’ emotions rather than the drama of what’s happening in a story.\n\nThree scenes stand out to me each time I’ve watch the movie, and as I paid attention to the composition of the film I noticed that the three scenes carry the most weight (for me) and they are all backed by the same piece of music, or variations on it. The scenes all revolve around the same locations, and call back to the same moment. The three scenes are (1) Taki’s first date with Okudera, (2) Mitsuha’s trip to see Taki (without realising she’s in the past relative to them), and (3) the Epilogue when Taki and Okudera catch up for old time’s sake. The OST track titles are (1) *Date*, (2) *Theme of Mitshua*, and (3) *Date 2*. The three tracks are variations of Mitsuha’s theme.\n\nMitsuha's theme, for me, stands out as the crowning piece of music in the movie. This is the heart of the entire film. For me, the movie isn’t about Shinto, or magic, of fate, or hope, or city vs rural life. These plot devices and contextual details all help weave a rich tapestry which enable original storytelling if you let them. Ultimately, what the movie is about is love, hopelessness and even sadness. If you end Your Name five minutes early, it’s a tragedy. Even with its optimistic and hopeful ending, the whole movie carries with it - and carries the audience on - a journey of hopelessness, impossible odds and the constant sense of unresolved loss despite the fact that there was nothing concrete to lose. All of these things are captured in Mitsuha’s Theme.\n\nI know the accolade of ‘central musical theme’ is probably supposed to go to *Sparkle* or *Nandemonaiya*, but the use of Mitsuha's Theme on both dates and when she goes to look for Taki emphasises the central themes of the film in a way in which the orchestral strains and energy of Sparkle and Nandemonaiya overshoot.\n\nWe first here Mitsuha’s theme when Taki goes on his date with Okudera (*Date*). At the same time, we hear Mitsuha dictating her SMS. The tragedy of the scene is evident. As a viewer, you know that Okudera is an easy adolescent crush for Taki - the kind that a lot of teenagers have on boys/girls have on older kids who are out of their league. We’ve seen nothing to suggest that there’s actually a spark of romance there on Taki’s merits alone. The date was set up only by virtue of Mitsuha’s involvement, only serving to compound the fact that Okudera is in fact out of Taki’s league. This isn’t a new idea - it’s pretty much the basis of every Jane Austin novel since she first picked up a pen. However the way the Date scene plays out leaves the viewer feeling down-hearted by the irony that fate brought Taki and Mitsuha together but can’t go the whole way. As Mitsuha narrates her SMS, you hear her upbeat and cheerful nature yet the tone of her dialogue is more forlorn than jealous. Her loneliness trapped in a parochial life she professes to hate is unsubtly put at odds by the visuals of two fashionable Tokyo kids having an unearned great time in fancy restaurants and visiting art galleries. Even before the first half of the movie has drawn to a close and we are faced with the Big Twist™, Mitsuha’s tears in the mirror feel like a sucker punch. You really feel for her - the country girl next door who speaks in dialect and can’t possibly be as chic and glamorous as Miss Okudera. On top of that, you've got the mutual but somehow unreciprocated and juxtaposed feelings of Taki and Okudera, who’s affections miss each other because they are imbalanced, contrasted with the genuine but unspoken love between Taki and Mitsuha, who’s affections miss each other because of the cruelty of fate (which we naturally think should helping not hindering them because that’s what movies have taught us). The scene can arguably be reduced to a contrast of immediate and easy adolescent crushes against a difficult but prevailing love which is blocked by circumstance. All of these things are captured in the music. I remember going to meet my (now) wife on our first date, and as I think back to that, the music from this scene fits the memories (as I remember them) quite well. The butterflies in the stomach, the way the track slowly eases into a comfortable melody the way you ease into someone’s company as a crush turns into a romance, the innocence of a first date where character failings don’t exist and you’re a perfect couple in each other’s eyes. All of these things seem to be captured in the piano solo which gets increasingly familiar as the chord progression unfolds, offset by a harmony which sits just outside of where you’d expect it to be for happier music.\n\nThe next time we hear the piece is when we see the tragic flashback when Mitsuha goes to Tokyo on the day of the date, only to find that Taki has no idea who she is. By this point of the movie we already know that she is from 2013 and turns up three years too soon for the date. Nonetheless, we again hear Mitsuha narrate her own monologue. The innocence of her questions and her self-doubt would be cute in a different context, but instead the setup of the scene means that the fun and the excitement of young love is belied again by the cruelness and perniciousness of fate. The two emotions play off each other, and you find yourself wishing things were different. [I will admit now that at this point in the movie this scene completely destroyed me - I sobbed like a sissy bitch.] Mitsuha’s actions are courageous and understandable. It shows her determination, her naivety, her positive attitude, and her hope. She travels a long way to get to Tokyo, and while she convinces herself that it is out of curiosity and maybe even hanging out with Okudera, the truth that she won’t yet reveal to herself is that she is in love with Taki - not his exciting life in Tokyo. As she boards the train that passes through Itomori once every two hours, and as she begins to ask herself questions, a sad and somehow mature violin joins the music (which isn’t present in *Date*, the first variation of the music). Completely unaware of the gravity we as the audience are feeling, in this scene the music carries a solemnity and fatefulness. As she runs for the train where she sees Taki, the music firms up, reflecting her resolute determination to meet the boy she loves. To be met with a 14 year old boy, three years her younger, is devastating, and the music slowly falls apart and becomes more chaotic as she is tussled off the train and the scene plays to a close, and we return to Taki climbing the mountain as fast as he can.\n\nAs the movie draws on we are treated to *Sparkle* as the two admit their feelings for one another and Taki’s love and determination wins Mitsuha a second chance. We don’t see exactly how things play out in Itomori. We see the comet strike but no confirmation is given one way or another. We know that the High School is on the ‘right side’ of the lake town, but in the film we’re intentionally given no idea of where the mayor’s office is. From the scene of the comet hitting, we see Taki wake up, wonder what he’s doing on top of a mountain, and then the film jumps to five years in the future, in the Epilogue.\n\nThe third and final time we hear the song is during Taki and Okudera’s walk down memory lane. The way the notes clink together in *Date 2* (this scene’s variation) captures the awkwardness and failing integrity of the memories, and somehow lead the viewer to think of that feeling of melancholy and nostalgia you get when you explore your old stomping grounds with old friends years after you've moved on and you reminisce on old times. The feeling is there in the music, the memory of the first date is there, but the music isn’t whole and is imperfect, like the memories we each have of our own childhood. We remember it the way we want to, but after enough years have passed, we don’t remember the truth, we remember what we want to remember (“Why did they go home? Did we have a fight?” The truth is that Taki sent them away). The clinked notes also capture the sentiment that something is missing - that something is Mitsuha. The music here expresses a feeling of growing up - as Okudera has - but for Taki it’s a case of not wanting to move on from the experiences he seems to remember having had, which has a direct parallel with what Taki and Mitsuha both say about not wanting to forget, and feeling they shouldn't. Contrasted with this, to hear the music playing while Taki rationalises his experiences and doesn't remember why he spent the night on “some mountain” adds the full weight of sadness to the whole exchange with Okudera as they do nothing but unproductively walk around and waste time. This time, instead of perfectly capturing the bitter fatefulness of Mitsuha’s trip to Tokyo in 2013, it remains open-ended and unresolved. Where it captured Mitsuha’s unwavering conviction that Tokyo would be worth the trip, here it captures Taki’s crestfallen loneliness in a city of 10 million people.\n\nThe music barely changes during these scenes and their thematic transitions, because it does the job so well of capturing it all. Running through the piece is a variation of the Goshintai theme, except where Goshintai has a more sombre tone, the tune in Mitsuha's theme is more positive. Interestingly, there is no “Theme of Taki” on the OST. There is one for Okudera, but it a safe and pretty piece, which doesn’t reveal anything we don’t already know about the character.\n\n\nFor me, this piece of music captures the core of the movie. What stood out me about the movie was that each scene was alive with a million interpretations. The depth of the film is striking. For me, the key part of depth is this single piece of beautiful, haunting, cheerful, tragic, captivating music. The way in which the music is used in the three scenes - tentatively exploring a blossoming romance (*Date*), the excitement of going to see your sweetheart (Mitsuha's trip to Tokyo; *Theme of Mitshua*), and the deep feeling of true love and not being whole by yourself (Taki's unresolved emotions during *Date 2*) - shows how profound a piece of music it is. In each scene it captures all of those emotions, but you only start to feel it out by the time you reach the Epilogue on the first viewing.\n\nIt's such a beautiful piece of music that captures so much about the longing and the love between Mitsuha and Taki. It's as delicate as it is intricate, as haunting as it is comforting, as peaceful as it is tragic, as fateful and ominous as it is open-ended, as much about the novelty of young romance as it is the maturity of abiding love, and as unwavering as it is crestfallen. In short the piece is masterful.\n\nThe sadness of the movie is so sincere that even when we reach the end of the movie with its resolution, the feeling that sticks is that of sadness. The one thread of hope we’re given in the whole film is the last line, in which Taki and Mitsuha are able to start their relationship the same way everybody else does: by asking each other’s name.\n\nThanks for reading.\n",

I was very disappointed, and left wondering if I'm missing something here.\n\nThere are many scenes where people do or say things that don't make sense to me. The scene where the title came from - why? What relevance is there in calling the other person your name? It just seems like a random, non-romantic thing to say at such a critical moment.\n\nOr when Oliver asks Elio if he's upset with him after they first slept together. Why would he be? He was all over him and clearly wanted it to happen. Then after the BJ... \"You're hard again, that's a good sign.\" What?\n\nThe apricot masturbation scene just felt disconnected tonally from the rest of the film. \n\nThen there's the fact that there are no stakes. The whole time it's supposed to be this forbidden love, but they never say why it's forbidden or what would happen if they are found out - and indeed, when it finally happens, nobody cares. It comes out in the end Oliver had someone back home waiting for him, but if they put that out there earlier maybe I would have felt that tension and struggle. Also they spent no time at all on whether Elio was struggling deciding between the girl and Oliver; and we don't get to see her reaction to Oliver and Elio until after Oliver is gone. She just says, I'm not mad at you. Again, no stakes.\n\nI didn't buy the ramp up to the romance at all. The dialogue at the WWI monument seemed to be missing critical sentences. \n\nThere are random fade transitions that I found very jarring. There are a million swimming scenes that felt unnecessary and killed the pacing for me. When the father gives his big speech at the end, while it's a nice speech, it kind of comes out of nowhere from a character we barely know anything about.\n\nSimilarly, when Oliver gives his speech about the etymology of apricot, or when Elio talks about the WWI monument - I don't believe people talk like this, so I don't believe in the characters, so I don't care about the romance.\n\nI'm sorry I'm rambling, and I respect the fact that this movie is displaying a homosexual relationship without harping on the fact that it's a homosexual relationship. But it was a huge miss for me and I'm hoping somebody can tell me what the hype is about, because I want to enjoy it as much as everyone else.",

        "text": "Before even touching on the film’s narrative, the overall aesthetic was eye candy. I love how the film showcased the visuals without being too “showy”, making the look of the film be the literal backdrop instead of the focus. One of my favorite visual points was where K is saved by the replicants and he’s laying by the open fire. \n\nThe embers of the fire transition into the cityscape of 2049 Los Angeles while the spinners (flying cars) travel through the city with Deckard in tow, all with that terrifying, understated, futuristic score in the background. Beautiful. \n\nThe film touched on a lot, but what really stuck with me was K’s longing to feel something. You can see it in his relationship with Joi, his hesitation to kill “the child”, mentioning that he’s “never killed something that was born”, and his utter disappointment when finding out he wasn’t the child. \n\nThere’s a sense of emptiness to the character and you can tell he’s trying to find meaning somewhere. He seems intent to fill a void where his soul might’ve been. \n\nIt probably really hit him when he saw that giant advertisement of “Joi”. The ad says he “looks like a good Joe”, the same name *his* Joi called him. His realization that nothing in his life is authentic, was devastating to the character. \n\nThat made his death all the more saddening. Even though his last action was a selfless one, he died in the cold, all alone, while Deckard meets his actual child. An inanimate being longing to be real; longing for real love from a mother and father, clinging on to the hope of a memory that was never his to begin with. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "When a cancer takes hold of the body, abnormal cells will continue to grow and multiply out of control, eventually afflicting one’s entire being, until death - annihilation. Like a cancer, the issues we deal with in our personal lives can grow within us, eating away, overwhelming us, taking hold of our mental and physical being. When we go to combat our affliction, trying to find and overcome its source, we enter a place where change is necessary, but often frightening. Paraphrased from the film, some face it, some fight it, and some just let go. \n\nIn Annihilation, we are shown five women, each afflicted in their own way - loss of a loved one, depression, alcoholism, cancer, and guilt. These women enter a mysterious area called the shimmer, of which all we know is that it is growing and will continue to expand, many have gone in and have not made it back, and the ultimate goal is to reach its source - the lighthouse. One by one, we see these women eliminated by the shimmer, whether by being savagely eaten, by letting go completely and letting it consume totally, or by a literal breakdown of the entire self - a self-destruction. \n\nWe come to understand Lena is the only character that feels she can have some sort of redemption; she’s not given up completely despite her internal conflict, unlike all other characters. This is why she has the strongest will to survive, and is the only one to make it to the lighthouse and live. \n\nAt this point, we are shown that the real Kane has died and an entity that is essentially a replication of him is the Kane that made it out of the shimmer. We see Lena fight the entity that is created from her blood. But what is the entity? We can take it in its simplest form, leaving out any alien or other interpretation: the entity has Lena’s DNA, is essentially Lena, save for a crucial detail. The entity has no recollection, no memory like the real Lena. We know this in part because of how the new “entity Kane” describes coming home near the start of the film: he was just outside the room and he saw her. He does not remember anything. Lena’s entity has all of her parts but is not her; it attempts to learn how she moves and how to be her during this battle. \n\nThe real Kane, like all the women except Lena, could not handle what was happening in the shimmer. He could not overcome what he had gone through, and what he felt when he reached the lighthouse, the source. So he killed himself, but before doing so tells the entity Kane, the new Kane with no recollection, no burden of his wife’s infidelity, to find Lena. Lena takes a grenade in hand, like Kane, but instead of killing herself, opts to destroy her entity. Lena knows that she cheated, she knows he knew, she knows she drove him to come out to the shimmer, and she knows she is ultimately responsible for his death because of this. But still, she must overcome. This entity has none of Lena’s memories, and harbors none of her guilt, but to eliminate a part of you to move on is not true coping. In essence, Lena accepts her actions, her guilt, and its outcomes, and destroys the entity that is not truly her, because just as it would be scary to have only the worst, most frightening part of your life be the only thing left, it would be equally disturbing to have all of you left, without anything, any memory that has made you, you. Whether that memory be being tickled in bed with your loved one, or the regret of cheating on him. \n\nThe source of the shimmer burns, and the entire “growth” ceases. Lena makes it out, having gone inside and overcome. She goes to see entity Kane. They hug. We see entity Kane’s eyes flicker in color - we know it is no longer Kane but the entity, he has changed. But then, we see Lena’s eyes do the same. It is the real Lena, but the shimmer has changed her, altered her from the inside. She’s a different Lena than the one who went in, in this sense. \n\nEntity Kane has no recollection of Lena’s cheating, and Lena has coped with her guilt by metaphor of the shimmer. Their affliction has been annihilated, and, together, they can now create something entirely new. \n\n\n\n\nJust my interpretation. I welcome any thoughts, expansion on these topics, or opinions! Thanks for reading. ",

        "text": "I just saw Game Night, I am blown away.\n\nThis movie was incredible. The insane plot, the hilarious dark humor, the brilliant cinematography. I loved every second of it. Where do I even begin. \n\nThis movie’s cinematography has been some of the most creative I’ve seen in a while.  \nFirst of all, the use of a tilt-shift lens when there were shots of the city, neighborhoods, etc. to emulate the miniature feel of a board game was brilliant. It matched the theme of the movie and what the characters were participating in perfectly. They’re pieces on a board, part of the game.\n\nThis was one of my favorite shots: When the characters go to Gary’s house to play Jenga and it cuts to a close up of Gary. Behind him on the wall are 2 mounted guns, one at each side of his head, pointing at his head. This scene is so visually alarming yet so interesting. I love what it says about Gary’s character. Makes you think. It’s one of those brilliant moments in cinema that I love.\n\nThe fight scene in the house where the egg is being tossed around between the characters is damn fluid too! I loved watching this chaos ensue.\nHonestly, the action scenes in this movie were all shot great. From the opening fight with Brooks and his kidnappers and the car chase where Annie, Max, and Brooks are being pursued, to the very end with the plane sequence. The action was beautiful. The brutality was captured in what I would consider a pretty realistic way. For example, when Annie shoots Max their reactions are hilarious yet genuine in a way. But you could really feel every single hit in these sequences; the cars hitting each other and fists landing blows.\n\nThe editing was also very clever, especially the little montage in the beginning with Annie and Max falling in love.\n\nNext: the plot. My god was this thrilling to watch unfold. I loved the 3 different motives each character had and how it drives the plot into more insanity.\n\nVery briefly:\nBrooks just wanted to redeem his relationship with his brother by setting up a game where Max could win his Stingray. \n\nGary just wanted to be included in Game Night, which propels him to actually kidnap Brooks which turns the fake game into a real one. No one knows about Gary’s involvement at this point. It’s revealed later during this act that Brooks is actually a criminal getting by on the black market and a man known as the Bulgarian wants a precious egg he sold. \nMax and the gang find the egg to exchange it for Brooks.\n\nPLOT TWIST: During the exchange, Gary shows up to rescue them and it’s revealed that the whole thing is just Gary’s insane version of Game Night. Everything was staged. \n\nDOUBLE PLOT TWIST: Gary doesn’t know anything about the egg or Brooks involvement with criminals and the Bulgarian shows up to the scene where they actually shoot Gary and take Brooks (with the list form the egg inside of him).\n\nWHAT!? Watching this over the top plot play out was one of my favorite experiences this year.\n\nThe comedy in this movie was also just pure gold. The tension between the characters was hilarious and the comedic moments were great. The cast was great, the characters were exactly who they needed to be. I came out of this movie very pleased with my experience. Planning on seeing it a second time soon. Sorry if this is all over the place. \n\nWhat are your guys’ thoughts on this movie? Did you enjoy it as much as me? \n",

        "text": "Maybe it’s right to start this analysis driven by the will to clear the field by present and future misunderstandings. \nPhantom Thread it’s maybe one of the five most visually stunning movies of 2017 and, perhaps, it is one of the most powerful formal and aesthetic synthesis ever conceived within the Seventh Art. The image organized on the screen by Paul Thomas Anderson is elegant, polished, bright, an elegance and a refinement that characterize every aspect of the movie. The point, however, it’s to understand the true nature of a movie like this. \n\nThe risk is to consider Phantom Thread a formalist movie, both in his visual elements (where all the focus is set on the attention to every aspect of the mise-en-scene) and in his thematic texture (considering those references to Hitchcock movies like withdrawals from the director’s style, exactly like it has already happened with the noir and with the cinema of John Houston and Robert Altman in Inherent Vice, postmodern ideas without substance, without something to tell us).\n\nThe risk is to consider Phantom Thread like a movie that is a direct consequence of the times in which it comes out: a stylized reflection made by Anderson on a film genre, sustained by the re-use of elements taken from a previous auteur (Hitchcock in this case) and reshaped by another undboubtly strong authorial figure (Anderson). \nPhantom Thread it’s certainly this. It’s a reflection on every aspect of love: the affection, the protection, the sexual element, the obsession, the control. \n\nThe love is mostly seen in a non-rethorical way, a feeling that can’t be separated from the dark side of life, from that REAL dimension, that in movies is only rarely investigated, precisely because it is often inconvenient, even harmful for the narration.\n\nPhantom Thread it’s all this but stopping at this interpretation would mean to stop a path, a research, in the texture of the movie which, paradoxically, would only be at the beginning.\n\nPhantom Thread it’s a prismatic movie. A film in which the elements listed so far (the formal elegance, the reflection on love, the Hitchcock references) work alone but they end up organizing an even more complex and ambitious discourse when you change prospective and you start putting them in communication with each other.\n\nPhantom Thread  it’s a great movie, but it becomes epochal if you are willing to change perspective.\nLet’s start from the role of the director within this mechanism. From the first moments it’s clear that Paul Thomas Anderson chooses to adopt a peculiar gaze through which he observes the story between Reynolds and Alma.\nIt’s not only distance or desire not to invade the intimacy between the two character with an excessive formal stylization, it’s some sort of reverential fear towards what (better, who, as will be understood shortly) he is observing.\n\nOnce we understand this, it is equally possible, therefore, that that same elegance, that purity, that brightness, that delicacy around which it is structured the movie are simply no more empty elements, which offer themeselves to our gaze but materials that cannot do anything but talk to us.\n\nWhat are they saying to us? Long story short, every single formal element of the film seems to serve the creation of a devotional, almost sacred, pure, virginal space, as if the whole movie were at the same time a temple and a celebration of \"something\" that takes shape during its development. \n\nWe can say that the whole movie wants to be a celebration of the artistic and creative process.  Reynolds is a God, the creative act is the highest gesture that he can grant to us, ordinary mortals. \n\nThe fabric is a kind of sacred material that only he or individuals authorized by him can use. Reynolds touches and works the fabric with gestures that recall those of an evocation, of a sacred ceremony that is renewed every time he sews a dress but above all emerges an idea of dignity, of election, connected to the dress and its use (Reynolds gives his dresses only to those who are worthy, as happens with miracles and apparitions and he punishes those who, according to him, has no respect for what he creates).\n\nThe feeling is that every action, every word, every breath of Reynolds refers at the same time to this world and to a metaphysical dimension, a \"beyond\", a distant world. \n\nSo here is that the film comes to configure itself as a kind of sacred space aimed at celebrating art and creativity in all their forms; every single element of the movie takes on a new depth if read through this new particular “lens” placed between the religious plan and the anthropological plan.\n\nReynolds Woodcock is a god, the Woodcock House is his temple, Paul Thomas Anderson is some sort of priest who, with absolute devotion, follows his actions, his gestures, without ever interrupting the flow of events, without ever intruding, and, at the same time placing itself as the guarantor of the film's message and as a mediator between the film, its meanings and the audience. \n\nIlluminated by this new light, the relationship established between Alma and Reynolds assumes an entirely new importance.\n\nA necessary passage within the path of anthropological maturation of a deity it’s its death and resurrection. \nThe Christ immediately comes to mind, all right, but from a syncretic point of view the death and resurrection of Jesus is nothing but the presentation, under other garments, of a thematic idea that occurs in Osiris but also in the Greek God Dionysus. \n\nLet’s think for a moment about the phenomenon of σπαραγμός (“Sparagmos”), a practice that can be traced back to Dionysus. In a moment of its history, Dionysus is in fact killed, torn to pieces and soon after reassembled from his remains, gathered by his faithful. \n\nReturned intact, the God, after suffering, then rediscovers all his strength and all his vitality. To celebrate the death and resurrection of Dionysus, periodically, the Greeks indicated sacrificial ceremonies, within the Dionysiacs (the feasts dedicated to God), in which they recalled the event. \n\nInside the rite, the Maenads, priestesses inebriated by the power of God chased the victim of the sacrifice, killed her, cut her into pieces and ate the meat. It is a cycle, a cycle in which life joins death and in which death returns to life through a violent process. \n\nThis process is, with very few differences, an echo of what happens in Anderson's film with Alma, at once thoughtful Vestal, to another aggressive Maenad who periodically \"kills\", poisoning him, his God, and immediately afterwards he takes care of him to make him come back to life through love and devotion.\nThe calm, the security, with which Reynolds accepts this condition of obscure cyclicality, having almost the certainty that the only way to be what it is consists in passing through death, even if only simulated, is quite emblematic in this sense.\n\nPhantom Thread, then, is an extraordinary film not only for the quantity of readings it offers to the eye of those who agree to scratch its surface but above all because, through it, Anderson simply implements one of the most ambitious attempts to combine art and life.\n",

Yet, as the evolution of silent film has shown, it was not only the viewer that had to re-learn to read the immediate language of the body, but also the body that had to learn to become readable. A stereotyped language of gestures and countenance had to be developed, so that the viewer can understand the development of the action quickly and unequivocally; considering that the theatrical acting style was immediately perceived as overly dramatic, more reduced and economical ways of playing had to be found under the guise of naturalism. Such attempts to render the human body readable predate the advent of film, as for example with Lavater’s physiognomics of the criminal, which used the medium of the portrait in silhouette, or Jean-Martin Charcot with the photographic documentation of hysteria. It is no accident that both criminology and neurology were interested in the typing of the human body as a means of control, and, in a certain way, film was no different.\"\n\nThoughts?",
