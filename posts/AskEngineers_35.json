        "text": "What design features that reduce noise are most applicable when designing a fan that is to be made from just cut and bent sheet metal? I mainly ask as most of these design features that I am aware of can be relatively difficult to form by bending a flat piece of metal, if not basically impossible. My tools are a bit limited causing some techniques to be unavailable to me.\n\nUltimately I am trying to replace the fan in a small convection-style oven, hence the sheet metal, as the original sounds nearly like a small jet engine. The current blade design is the, seemingly, fairly standard design where the blades are bent at right angles. I am more than willing to trade a portion of the air flow for lower noise. I did attempt to find information on this, though I was only able to find information that was either more applicable to cast/CNC'd blades, or that seemed to only be for more standard blades. (I.e. computer case fans)\n\nAny advice or resources would be greatly appreciated",

        "text": "All the talk regarding water becoming a limited resource in the next century always brings up the idea of desalination to make potable water. The issue we know is the amount of power required during the process makes it somewhat infeasible. An idea that popped into my head was why don’t we use sea water in power generation (steam turbines)? We would get the potable water from the steam and generate power at the same time. A couple points I could think off the top of my head:\n\n-Salt water has a lower boiling point. Does that limit the energy of the steam or increase the efficiency of the process?\n\n-The amount of potable water may be negligible?\n\n-The amount of energy required to get the steam to condensate still makes it too energy intensive. \n\n\nIs this feasible? Has it ever been proposed or is it just a bad idea? Interested to hear how others might poke holes in this idea.",

        "text": "Good evening, I'm looking for some help figuring out if it's possible to tie together pressure washers to achieve higher psi and gpm in a few different scenarios.  The scenarios can be viewed at the following imgur link:  https://imgur.com/a/bhG8800\n\nIn scenario 1, there's three 3000 psi pressure washers at 2 gpm flow.  I believe if you place 3 check valves along your output line, as they're tied together you'd increase your gpm flow rate but maintain the same 3000 psi.  Is that correct?\n\nSame situation in scenario 2, only 4 units at 1900 psi and 1.5 gpm flow rate.  There, I assume you'd get 1900 psi at 6 gpm.\n\nIf the above is correct, in scenario 3, is it possible to somehow sacrifice flow rate for higher psi using lower psi input?  In this scenario, 4 units supply 1900 psi at 1.5 gpm each.  Is there a valve or something I'm not aware of that would allow for higher psi to be achieved without that psi back flowing to the units?  I understand there'd be equal pressure on both sides of the check valves, so at 1900 psi, the pressure washers would stop unless there was a way to accrue higher psi on the output side while allowing lower psi to feed into it?\n\nThen if that is possible, in scenario 4, what would need to be done to achieve the original 3000 psi at 6 gpm using 1900 psi at 1.5 gpm units?\n\nI apologize for my lack of knowledge in this area, after trying to look up how to achieve this, I came up with many more questions than answers.  I don't know if scenario 3 or 4 are even possible given lower input and the pressure applying both directions along the line, I think it'd just equal out at the check valve and it wouldn't be possible to achieve higher on the output side without higher psi pumps on the input.  Just don't know what I don't know, and if there is a special valve or combination of plumbing parts like buffer tanks, check valves or regulators that'd allow for lower psi input to add up to higher output at the loss of flow, that's ultimately what I'm after.  I'm trying to achieve with electric pumps what you'd get with gas powered.\n\nThank you for all the advice and help, and if this is entirely impossible, I'd totally understand if it's a non-starter.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or what I'm missing in how I'm approaching the problem.",

By performing some preliminary calculations using the kinematic equations (and neglecting air drag) it seems that for an object to reach 3 m into the air it must have an initial velocity of 7.67 m/s. That seems insanely fast.\n\nMy question is what do I use to do this? How do I get something moving that fast? I am thinking about having the cylinder sit on a carriage on some linear rails, but how do I get the carriage to move at 7.67 m/s? From what I know, linear actuators are too slow and pneumatic actuators are faster but not fast enough (or are they?). \n\nI recalled this Mark Rober video where he used a “spring loaded piston” to create a bionic punching arm ([https://youtu.be/Rsxao9ptdmI?t=660](https://youtu.be/Rsxao9ptdmI?t=660)) . These spring loaded pistons might be what I am looking for, but I am not sure how he made them or where he could have gotten them from (I have had no success searching for such items online). I have also considered taking inspiration from some of the “powder actuated tools” but I am not entirely sure of the math behind these, and this seems like simultaneously the most sketchy and expensive option.\n\nIs there another option I am not considering?

The compensation details are as follows:- Base salary - 2,400,000 Rs/Year. CTC - 3,300,000 Rs/Year (Which they will give in the form of RSUs, sign-on bonus etc.)\n2. JP Morgan Glasgow, United Kingdom - I have got this offer off-campus. The compensation details are as follows:- Base salary - 37000 pounds/Year, 3,500 pounds (Sign-on bonus which is a one-time payment) and Bonus up to 2000 pounds/Year &amp; Visa sponsorship.\n\nBoth of the offers are Software Engineer Graduate. I have always wanted to go abroad, and this is my chance, but I wanted to know what would be a better option to take here. My whole family is in India, and I do not know anyone in Glasgow. I have this thing in my mind I want to pursue an MBA from abroad after 2 years of work, and JP Morgan will reimburse my tuition fees for that but with a bond. If I drop the MBA idea altogether in future, I can switch jobs in London and all. But is this compensation worth going there for?\n\nIt would help with all of your suggestions.",

Setting up that vise is problematic for our machinist, so he came to the office to ask engineering for an answer. I'm the technical assistant/draftsman/support guy in this. 3 Engineers and myself couldn't quite wrap our heads around this problem. We started spinning the 3d model along the 3 principal axis' (of the part, not of the base model as the part would move with the vise), and compared it to a model that showed the part in it's final location. We were hoping to be able to extract the necessary angles by doing so. Unfortunately that seemed to lead to more confusion. I've tried projecting lines to planes to calculate angles and that gets us closer, but never quite. I've tried watching youtube videos, but the best I got was some guy showing how he cut a 45 degree angle in some square stock by rotating one axis 45 degrees. Another video deconstructs the vise. Unfortunately, neither were particularly useful. Is there some mathematical representation of this or some documentation that anyone knows of that addresses this type of problem? The best solution I have so far is that the part could be scribed and rotated prior to clamping it down in the vise jaws so that only one axis of rotation is required, this solution was pushed back against however.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Apologies if this is dumb, on the surface it seems like it should be fairly easy, and I've been stuck on this for about 3 hours now.",

I would probably be aiming for the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) area. Any tips would be appreciated 👍",

If you don't have experience in it, but have experience in engineering I'd like to know your opinion on the field, the pros and cons as well, your favorite thing about it, and any advice :)",
