Here‚Äôs an example of his typical if-statement:  \n\n        if(something &amp;&amp; something &amp;&amp; something == somethingElse){\n          // weird stuff‚Ä¶ }\n\n-\tAdmitted that he copies his code off of Google searches\n-\tPut regexes everywhere when they‚Äôre unnecessary to do simple things (like checking if something is in an array lol)\n-\tMade two functions that do two different things but called them `checkTheThing` and `determineTheThing` ??? I still have no idea what they do.\n\nI‚Äôve tried to give him some guidance once I realized that he was an idiot but that I would be stuck with him until his contract expired. Here‚Äôs how it usually goes:\n\n-\tAsk him how he‚Äôs doing on this thing I need from him\n-\tHe complains that he doesn‚Äôt know where to start\n-\tI verbally tell him what to do. I even give him some options so that he feels like he has some ownership &amp; agency\n-\tHe doesn‚Äôt get it\n-\tI give him a to do list\n-\tHe still doesn‚Äôt get it\n-\tI give him a detailed to do list with pseudocode\n-\tIt takes me an hour to review 10 lines of his code\n\nI‚Äôve even tried asking him why he keeps making weird decisions but this is how it usually goes:\n\n**Me**: Why did you copy and paste `a.really.long.query.that.looks.ugly` 20 times instead of assigning it to a variable?  \n**Him:** Ok, I‚Äôll assign it to a variable.  \n**Me:** No, it‚Äôs not just ok when I have to review your code and completely re-do things.  \n**Him:** Ok, ok\n\nSo I still have no idea if he understands what he‚Äôs doing or if he even understands what I‚Äôm saying. All he ever does is tell me that it‚Äôs ok. \n\nAt this point I no longer care that he is creating more work for me. I just want to figure out who hired him and how he got this far in life while being such an idiot.",

        "text": "So the python code is doing some computational work for an oil company, but I think their intern only had like 3 days left before his internship ended and his project was due, because he gave them the hackiest piece of shit code I have ever seen.\n\nThere are an unreal amount of things wrong with this code, but lets go over some of the more infuriating parts.\n\n1. Absolutely no comments other than commented out code/magic numbers.\n\n2. He hard coded in all of the file names that he tested the code on, so it only works for the specific files hes commented in (and he rewrites it for each spot in the code its used instead of just naming something at the top of the script that you can easily change.)\n\n3. He does the same computation so many times in the code that it takes 13 minutes to run each time. So debugging at the star twas an absolute nightmare (i didnt know which parts were safe to comment out at first)\n\n4. He imported pandas, but instead of storing data he reads from excel files in a dataframe he writes to a dataframe converts to a numpy array and iterates the numpy array to write the data to a .txt file with a randomly generated name.\n\n5. **THE WORST FUCKING PART** He uses glob to find all files that end in .xlsx and even though he fucking hard coded the name of the file in all over the script already instead of just opening by calling pandas.read_excel(file_name) he fucking does a glob search and stores a list of all .xlsx files and saves them as a files_list (but he just called it 'n'). He then uses pandas.read_excel(files_list[7]). So the code only works for the right fucking file if you have the same number of excel files every time you run the code, and if you want to open a different excel file for your data you have to know which number in the alphabetical list it is.\n\n6. (cont) The absolute cherry on top though is these excel files are so big that if you keep opening them a cached version of the file is made with a name like '~name.xlsx' and it changes the number of files in the directory and breaks your fucking code. It also doesn't even show up in the file GUI so if you arent iterating through the files with glob or something similar you can't figure out why its not opening the same goddamn file anymore.\n\n7. The plotting of the data does like 10 calculations, and just constantly rewrites over the same .txt file without adding to it (so lots of data is lost). Then he uses a plotting function called seaborn.kdeplot() which does the kde calculation for him and plots it, so he never ever uses the .txt data that he is sort of storing.\n\n8. in order to plot a movie he downloaded ffmpeg off the internet and is using a subprocess command to run 'ffplay + file_name', which only works if you have ffmpeg installed, but doesnt tell you that you need that anywhere.\n\n8. he has files and files being imported with tons of functions defined that are never called and not even commented out.\n\n9. he has variables in functions that arent initialized to any value or used in where in the script before the function is called, yet they have a consistent initial value (i still havent figured this one out).\n\n10. he changes the current directory of the script every time he imports a file instead of just using the full path so it leaves the .txt and other \"temporary\" files saved all over every directory.\n\nI manage to figure what the hell this man was trying to write and i got my own version of the script written. His code takes anywhere from 9minutes to 17 or so, and averages around 13 minutes/run. My code runs in 0.05 seconds on average. The only work i had to do to get it to work was download a better library someone had written based off some recent research.\n\nIf i make it through the day porting the rest of this code i'll be drinking an entire bottle of whiskey when i get home.",
