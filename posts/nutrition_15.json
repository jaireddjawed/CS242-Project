        "text": "Hi, I've recently begun cooking almost entirely at home, and so I have a lot of leftovers, which I now eat almost daily. I'm saving tons of money and making delicious food everyday in the process. Leftovers open up so many culinary possibilities!\n\nOne thing I've wondered about, though, is whether or not leftovers lose nutrients over the couple of days that they're stored?\n\nFor example, I made a dal with yellow lentils and sweet potato. It's quite healthy when fresh. If stored and reheated on the stovetop over the following couple of days, would a dish of this kind lose a significant amount of nutrients? Would I be noticeably healthier if I were to only eat freshly prepared food of this kind?\n\nMany of my recipes include vegetables. I am beginning to incorporate meat into the majority of my meals, though.\n\nThanks!",

Ive had a very intense ED in the past and seeing the “___ calories left” or seeing that I’m “in the red” for eating a few more calories than I was “supposed to” is triggering. Right now I just want to monitor what I’m eating to make sure I’m getting the nutrients I need and possibly slowly work my way up to the idea of losing a few pounds. Does anyone know of a good app that counts calories without there being a set limit or goal?",

And the main consideration is the glycemic effect? So like, if one were to eat vegetables with fiber first and then eat white rice or eat them together, maybe with some fat, that has the same effect as eating brown rice straight up?  I am just trying to figure out why refined carbs are so vilified. I feel that other than this whole blood sugar insulin thing going on with pure refined carbs like sugar or rice, a carb is a carb whether it’s from fruit or vegetables or whole grain rice or noodles or whatever. Is this correct?",

What would the consequences of having fats as the main calories be? I presume that question has to do with metabolism; perhaps fats metabolize slower and, as such, we would feel low on energy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally looking forward to getting to know more about this :)",
