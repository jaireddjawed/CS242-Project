        "text": "My friend Jake is an ass, and cheap. I have a lot of stories about him, though not all petty, but all of them aggravating. You see, Jake ~~sometimes~~ values being stingy over being a good friend. We've been friends forever because...we have been. Finding friends is hard, we have similar interests, and generally get along great when we do get together. You know how it is. Maybe? Onto the pettiness.\n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I know I'm within a 4 year period where we went to the same prep school. Jake, myself, and a few other friends used to do console and pc gaming, so we'd all chip in and buy gear and games. Usually it was me and the the other two friends, but usually if you harassed Jake enough he would chip in. Eventually we moved to PCs when we found out how much easier/cheaper it was. Well occasionally we'd all find a game we want to play, and we wanted Jake to join because he's our mate. He'd drag his feet on buying something, so we'd reward this behavior by occasionally giving him the CDs to borrow or our hard-earned warez-shares (for you oldies out there). We shared a room, so I was his main source of the goods.\n\nWe all had gotten into Command &amp; Conquer, bought the CDs, and wanted him to play. He seemed to like the look of it, and I was nagging him on when he was gonna get it. He eventually just made the snarky comment that \"Why would I bother buying it, you're eventually just going to cave and give it to me anyways.\" I felt like I crossed my eyes and squinted, but probably said some lame thing like \"uh ok\" and that was that. I never gave him the game, he never bought it, and never played that one with us.\n\nI remember we played other games off and on as we moved on with life and the internet became more prevalent. Jake and I got jobs in the same city and generally stayed/stay in touch pretty regularly. One day a few months ago he calls me and he needs a piece of software. It wasn't Red Alert, it was a copy of Windows. He knew I had a few extra legitimate copies, and wanted one pretty bad. I know this, because as loopy as he can act, he mentioned it quite a few times the night before/next day. I never agreed to it, but he came over the day after he asked for it, and my wife made us a great meal. As the night wrapped up and I walked him out to his car, he blurts out \"uh can I have that software?\" My memory refreshed with the cool hatred of his snarky comment 16-19 years ago. I said \"nah, I think I'm going to use it on a home server I'm building in a few months.\" He was indignant, and said \"Really? But I need it now and you might not build that server!\" It was awkward as hell but I said \"sorry can't help you!\"\n\nIn truth I could have gave it to him because I never had any intentions of building a server. But I'm still pissed over his cheap ass almost two decades ago. Fuck you Jake, you cheap, leaching bastard.\n\nEdit: grammar &amp; spelling &amp; some clarification. ",

My university has had several graduation ceremonies in the last week and I had been away from my Uni town, coming back the night before my graduation ceremony.\n\nNow one of my housemates had been a bit of a pain all year, not very conscious of other people's space and stuff and thought they were some intellectual with better viewpoints than the rest of us. Anyway, I come back the night before my graduation to find that he had been using my towel while I was away without telling me, tried to cover it up by washing it before I came back, and had left it in a corner of our house to dry (which it didn't very well). I was pissed off, but luckily I had a spare towel. Anyway the next morning I ironed my shirt for graduation and left the ironing board out while putting my iron back in my room, and went off to graduation.\n\nAfter my ceremony the housemate messages me if I had an iron he could borrow for his graduation ceremony the next day. Now obviously I did as the ironing board had been left out, but as he hadn't asked me to use my towel, he didn't deserve my iron. Therefore I didn't reply to his message and made sure I didn't see him for the rest of the day. I woke up the next day after he had gone to his ceremony to find a brand new iron in the house! He had to go out and buy a new one as mine was the only one in the house. I felt very satisfied with myself, even though I did very little at all.",

        "text": "So this happened about three years ago, I was 19 and in 'university' (that's how I'll call it because I live in Europe things work a little different around here).\n\nI am female and I was assigned a group project for science class with 3 other guys who were all a few years younger than me (think 16/17) and extremely immature. I'd be the ONLY one to bring up the project an *try* to get us all together and share tasks. They'd laugh at my face, be annoying, make misogynistic comments about me being dumb because I'm a girl and and just being typical douchey teenage boys in a herd, I suppose? Because *fuck me* for trying to actually pass school.\n\nI was getting kind of nervous not so much because the due date was getting close, but because the due date was getting close for *this particular class, with this particular teacher.* To give you an idea, this teacher was pretty tall, around the age of 60, had a glass eye and - I kid you not - a mustache that looked a little bit *too* much in the style of Adolf Hitler. He was also extremely conservative in his way of doing/ thinking. I promise you, you did not want to get this guy pissed because it was hell. I was legitimately scared of him, and so where most of the other classmates. Most of the time he'd be 'nice', but in a way that had 'make one wrong move or noise and I'll go nuclear' all over it and he was just very condescending in general. (BUT he was one of the only teachers in our university that knew what he was talking about, so I'll give him *that*.)\n\nSo anyway, due's getting close, I was getting scared and I started to realise I wasn't going to be able to talk to these guys by myself. Also I simply refused doing all the work for them because fuck them. I knew that if we didn't finish this project on the day we had to though, we'd probably remember it for the rest of our lives lol. So I send fuhrer teacher an e-mail, explained things weren't really going anywhere because my teammates simply refused to work with me. He answered something along the lines of getting together with the group and him to have a talk with him.\n\nFor the last time, I went up to my worthless project-group to inform them I e-mailed the teacher and we had to be at the classroom at x time to sort things out with the teacher and try to bring this whole thing to a decent end. Of course, once again I didn't get a normal answer. This time one of them dudes (lets call him Peter) says 'Did you send him nudes of yourself or something? Because he doesn't reply to my e-mails.' All of them laughing again. I just smiled and left, because this was the last fucking straw for me but I wasn't going to give them the pleasure of snapping.\n\nWe finally sit down with the teacher, us in a row across of him. He's being his serious and scary self, making some patronising comments about how we are basically retarded for not being able to figure this out ourselves, and asks us what the problem is. I look him dead in the eyes and tell him 'Well, one of the problems is that *this guy* assumes I'm sending you nudes to get in touch with you through e-mail? Maybe we can start there.'\n\nI looked at Peter and his face went completely blank. I have never seen a teenage boy shit his fucking pants the way this guy did. I was smiling internally but not externally because honestly I was too afraid to do that. I was almost too afraid to look at the teacher too, but I did and he was literally turning red. I've seen him mad, but never *this* mad, raging about how he had the guts to say something like that, what Peter think would happen if kids in school picked up on a 'rumor' like that and just completely ranting on and destroying him. God, it felt so good. My other group members did not dare to speak a word, of course. They all looked scared as hell.\n\nThe kid tried to apologise along the lines of 'I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to, I actually really like \\*my name\\* and females are not dumb' it was a pathetic shit show but it felt *so fucking good* and I promise you we finished the project perfectly in the end and I barely had to lift a finger anymore.",

Luckily the phone was fine but the cable was broken (corrosion on the contacts probably).

It doesn't make me feel nauseous, just kind of like spitting up I guess. I wasn't treated for it till I was a little older because for some reason I didn't tell my parents about it. So anyway my brother and I had bunk beds and I had the top bunk being the older sibling. So one night we're arguing about what to watch on tv. I'm on the top bunk with the remote and he's on the bottom bunk and keeps using the buttons to change the channel back. I'm starting to get really pissed. We had just had dinner and I helped myself to a big bowl of vanilla ice cream. So what do I do? That's right, I lean over the bed and throw up a huge glob of ice cream directly onto his head. He starts screaming bloody murder and crying while I have a grin from ear to ear. My mom hears and comes to see what's happening and immediately thinks I just have a stomach virus. I go along with it and spent the next day playing banjo tooie on N64 while my brother had to go to school.",

        "text": "So first off, this just happened to my friend and he asked me to post it, we are going to call him Mike. Mike is in a military college and loves to talk about his service a lot(more than he should). One thing he does not like is when people talk about working some sort of service when they actually have not done it (stolen valor and all that). There was this girl, we will call her Izzy, that Mike had been talking on-off with for a long time. Izzy decided she would brag to him about how she (a recent high school graduate) had been invited to join the FBI. Mike found this odd and called her out on it. He asked some questions including which division. She claimed the SWAT (a police division) invited her to fight male criminals. He laughed, called her a liar and she needed to leave him alone. Izzy then spammed his phone for a day and he kept telling her to back off. Earlier today, she must have changed the story and told some of her friends because a few people threatened to kill/jump/attack him. Mike got upset and decided he was going to get back at her. He has a friend who runs a meme/spam page on Instagram that is followed by some of the worst that social media has to offer. This meme page put a poll up to raid her profile and spam liar across all of her photos. The raid army then moved full speed to her comment section. I am not sure how many people spammed her account at once, but it was enough to break her Instagram page for a bit. Her page has now been changed to private, and Izzy has blocked Mike on all social media. Long story short, meme pages are full of people with too much time on their hands.\n\nTL;DR Girl my friend was talking to pretended to be offered a job by the FBI and he called her on it. She threatened his life so he got a meme page to raid and crash her Instagram.\n\n**EDIT:** After reading a lot of the comments I wanted to clear a couple things up. First, I have my own disagreements with my friend about how much he talks about his service, but he is enlisted and is going to school on condition of deployment and further military condition after he is finished (I am not very knowledgeable of military procedure). Second, When I say break her Instagram, I understand that it a powerhouse of a social media and at least for him and myself, when her account was being spammed neither of us were able to load her page, everything was not working but everything else would load fine. I assumed it was broken, so I do not know what happened if it was not broken but we could not have accessed it. Third, a lot of people are saying we (Mike and myself) are garbage. If we were not garbage, why would I be posting about petty garbage revenge to begin with?",

        "text": "The deed:\n\nWhen i was 14, iwas a very insecure boy, even more than you usually are. Obviously, I never had a girlfriend and i was afraid of a lot of social interactions.\nTypically for that age, i also had false friends.\nOne of them always acted like he wanted to help me 'hey you need to go out more, get some nice clothes, work out, come on, i help you, tell me which girl you like', stuff like that. He obviously did it to boost his own ego and whenever i actually was near success he would talk me down, but he is not the guy this post is about (He got his payback, but by karma, not by me).\n\nIn any case, the guy invited me to go shopping together into a bigger city (which was already a bit scary to me since we were country bumpkins and i never really used public travel in a bigger city on my own before), but i was excited.\nI felt thankful, but then i suddenly hear that the 'i help you to get clothes so you get more popular deal' was no more, since he had invited another classmate, Jordan.\n\nJordan was the son of a lawyer, had money and an obnoxious attitude, but I didn't really have beef with him before. So while being disappointed that this was less about me but about them shopping (and alienating me while doing it), i was still kinda ok with that.\n\nObviously being an insecure 15 year old, i only took clothes that really didn't fit well or didn't look well together, i simply was not used to even really think about how what looked. And then they started making fun of me a lot.\nI am not someone who cannot take being made fun of in a friendly matter and i laughed along, even if it, in hindsight, certainly was not friendly. But that was not the deed.\nI was still happy and still thought some of the clothes looked well and we were at a burger king and just talking (well, they were) until Jordan suddenly could not contain himself anymore.\n\nHe started mocking me by ironically impersonating me (with things i never said but he thinks i thought), like 'oh, I am waiting for a girl I love until i can confess to her', telling me how many girls he has slept with and that i'd never fuck someone.\nThis went on for almost an hour and even tho i cannot really repeat his exacts phrasings and such, it hit very close to home.\nMy 'friend' laughed about it and said nothing and basically i was told on my one try to get out of my insecurity that i am a mess, did horrible and would always stay that way.\nThere was nothing i could say to him. He did look well, I knew he had great connections with girls, I was defeated because my  pseudo friend chimed in and i just went silent.\nAfter we finished eating, i told them i will go home now without adressing the issue and went my way.\n\nThe revenge:\n\nFlash forward 1,5 years. Jordan and I never really talked again. For him, he had exerted dominance over me and i think that was that for him. But i never forgot it.Since i was a latebloomer, it took me long enough to have my first relationship and thus his words stung even harder since i always thought about whether he might be right.\n\nNow, stereotypically, Jordna had the looks and the girls but bad grades and i was doing well in school.\nJordan's rich father had promised him a car (and a very nice one at that, in my country you can drive with 17 years) if he gets a C instead of his usual D- in the last math test before the year ends. He wanted Jordan to transit to a better school and thought that a better Math grade would help him with that.\n\nAnd Jordan motherfucking wanted that car. he couldn't shut up about it, but it didn't help, he was lazy and horrible at math.\nIn math class (because teacher randomed seats), i sat next to him. He must have thought I didn't even remember the thing back then because when he made jokes or said stuff to me, i laughed along just to make it less awkward. He must have confused that to being on good terms.\nHe asked me whether I would write his exam for him (the teacher was not strict about moving ppl apart from each other, so we would still be sitting next to each other) for 100 Euro (as i said, rich kid, was not a lot for him).\nHe said he would write my name on top of the paper and i would write his name on top of mine. In math, noone will really see a difference with the numbers and our handwriting didn't look too differently from each other. He said he'd do his best but even if I just get a D, it would be not so bad for my grade and if I get him a C or higher so he'd get the better of two final grades, i get the 100 Euro.\nI witnessed my chance and obviously took it.\nI made it as believable as possible, but i got him an F. \nThe hard part was to make it look believable enough for the teacher to think he made an effort, but horrible enough for the teacher to ACTUALLY give out an F. Like, I couldn't do correct approaches but wrong solutions, then he'd have too many points. \nIt was not easy, but i managed to do it.\nHe got an F instead of his usual D- and that ACTUALLY made him repeat the grade, they had no other choice than letting him repeat the grade because his other bad mark was already announce by the teacher in question and there was nothing any teacher could have done to save him.\nThe best? I agreed only if he handed me out 50 Euro in advance and the other 50 after I did it. So i got a nice bonus out of this.\n\n\nMotherfucker repeated the grade and never got anywhere in his life.\nAbout him trying to get his money bakc: Oh he tried to threaten me via other people. Like 'be careful man, Jordan says he is gonna smash you'. And i wish so much he woulda tried that.\nI was a person who let other ppl push them around, but i never was afraid of them physically, i would have wished to punch it out with him. But I never had an interaction with jordan again, i just see what he is up to because his facebook is not private.",

        "text": "Posted this, and it seems like petty revenge to me. \n\nI had to go to the ER a few years ago because I got something stuck in my eye. The pain was excruciating, and it was bad enough that the urgent care clinic said I really needed to go to the ER. \n\nI go to the ER, get through triage and immediately see a doc who flushed, dyes, scopes, and eventually is able to get the burr out of my eye without blinding me. All good, I think, because the hospital is in network. Well, fine readers, it turns out that while a hospital may be in-network, you can be treated by a doctor, IN AN EMERGENCY, and get a bill for thousands of dollars because the doctor you saw, FOR AN EMERGENCY, was an independent contractor and therefore out of network.\n\nI was FLOORED to get a $3100 bill for the care I received. Sure, I was happy that I wasn’t blind, but $3100 seemed steep. I called, and sure enough, the facility fees were almost nothing thanks to the insurance discount, but no discount at all on the Doctor. I was very angry, because I really had no choice in who saw me. And if there had been no in-network doctor on duty, would I have had to wait?\n\nSo, I hatched a plan. They would not negotiate on price AT ALL. I thought this was ridiculous. I could have paid the bill, but I have principles, damnit! I told the billing folks that I couldn’t afford the bill, and wanted a payment plan. I’m not sure if there is a law requiring them to accept a payment plan, but they agreed and asked what I could afford. I told them $10/mo. \n\nHere is the thing about medical bills. They can’t charge you interest on them. They also cannot report you to collections if you are paying. Finally, it has zero impact on your credit score if you take a payment plan (unless it goes to collections). \n\nSo now, for a procedure I was billed $3100 for a little more than 2 years ago, I’ve paid $260 on. I have the $10/mo on auto-pay and I’ve basically forgotten about it. \n\nThey’ll get their $3100.... but it’ll be over almost 24 more years. And they will spend almost $150 in postage, mailing me a bill every month that immediately goes into the shredder to be recycled.",

        "text": "Sorry this is super long, TLDR at bottom. \n\nBack in middle school, I had a friend named Carly (not her real name). She was very spoiled, very whiny, and very, very stupid. \n\nOne day after school we decided to hang out at the local arts and craft store for whatever reason. This particular craft store I knew was having a problem with shoplifters, and I casually mentioned to Carly that I noticed they didn’t have any security cameras and thought that was probably why they were having those issues. Well Carly decided to use this bit of information to steal about $200 worth of craft supplies. What she was going to do with all of that junk, I have no idea, but I digress. Once I realized what she was doing I left the store and went home. I was a good kid for the most part and didn’t want anything to do with her breaking the law.\n\nFast forward to the next day. I was watching tv with my mom when she got a phone call. She got up and left the room, so I couldn’t hear what was being said but she sounded angry. She came back in and told me that it was Carly’s mom. Apparently Carly had told her mom that I had forced her to steal all the stuff she had taken from the store. I guess she had had a guilty conscience and decided to confess, but blamed it on me in the hopes that her punishment would be less severe. Naturally, I was super angry so I told my mom the truth about what actually went down. Like I said, I was a good kid so thankfully she believed me and I wasn’t punished. I was, however, thoroughly annoyed that Carly would throw me under the bus like that and decided that our friendship wasn’t worth the drama. I didn’t, however, forget this injustice. \n\nA few years later, we ended up on our high school lacrosse team together. I kept my distance from her, but decided to keep an eye out for an opportunity to get back at her. Carly wasn’t very good at the sport, she was always cradling her stick low making it super easy to steal the ball from her. I noticed she would get VERY frustrated whenever this happened to her, and I decided to enact my revenge. \n\nDuring one of our practices, I volunteered to be her dedicated defender and took this opportunity to mess with her. Every time she would get the ball I would easily knock it out of her stick and steal it from her. I did this probably about 5-10 times, and each time she became more and more frustrated. After about the 11th time, she completely lost it. She threw her stick on the ground so hard that it snapped the head in half, laid down in the middle of the field and had a full on 2 year old tantrum complete with kicking and screaming that it wasn’t fair that I was stealing the ball and making her look bad. After about 5 minutes of this and everyone just staring at her in shock, she gets up and walks off the field to sit on the sidelines a pout. \n\nWord quickly spread around school about her tantrum and she will now be forever known as “Crazy Carly”. \n\nTLDR; Girl throws me under the bus and blames me for her illegal activities, I mess with her and her new nickname at school is Crazy Carly. \n\n",

        "text": "(Insert obligatory apology for format due to being on mobile here :) )\n\nI'd like to start off by saying I'm not sure how petty this is and I don't remember too many details, but I was sure satisfied by this.\n\nI work as a Customer Service Associate at a place that's sort of a mix of a 7/11, Subway, and a Starbucks (and throw in a gas station cause it's Florida). At this point I'm acting as a cashier, and this customer has been rude this whole time, complaining that I'm being a bad cashier and slow etc. etc. (in reality I just had some slow customers in front of him unfortunately), and because I'm young, people always assume I'm new/incompetent. I've worked there over a year smh.\n\nAnyway, he's being extremely rude the whole time and his total comes to $5.02. He hands me a $5.\n\nMe: \"sir, your total is five OH TWO, you've given me five.\"\n\nHim: \"are you really gonna make me break a $20 for 2 cents??\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, sir. I can't afford to have my drawer short. I need the 2 cents.\"\n\nHe eventually gave me the $20 and I got a lot of satisfaction from all the clinking of the 98¢ coming out of the auto-change thing. Customer behind said she wouldn't gotten mad if she were me, and complimented me on my patience. I didn't make her break a dollar for 7¢ ;)\n\nTL;DR: guy was rude, I made him break a $20 for 2¢, don't be an asshole to the people handling your money :)",

        "text": "There is a full kitchen in my office building. I am always at the office before anyone else, and have noticed that the second person who arrives uses the Keurig first-thing, stirs his coffee, and leaves the damn spoon in the otherwise-beautifully-empty sink EVERY. DAMN. DAY, with a tiny, god-forsaken, disproportionately-enraging pool of coffee in the curve of the spoon. There is a dishwasher RIGHT. THERE. \n\nWhile I am a horrendously OCD person, my primary issue is that the front desk person is in charge of starting and unloading the dishwasher, while all other employees rinse and load their dishes. She is an amazing person that helps everybody and solves just about everything office-related. Yet this man-child refuses to rinse off a damn spoon.\n\nThis Keurig takes literally 5 minutes to power on and heat up every day. I'm not a coffee person, but I found that it has programmable on/off times (no one had ever noticed), and decided to set it up to be nice. No one here knows that I first programmed it almost two years ago, nor that I continue to re-program the Keurig after every power outage, etc.\n\nSo.\n\nYesterday after he arrived, I got tired of seeing that spoon, that embodiment of laziness and inconsideration, so I changed the auto-on time to after he usually gets here, but still before everyone else does. \n\nThis morning, I could hear him swearing from my office about the \"piece of shit\" Keurig. Apparently, he also missed a phone call from an important client, because he usually leaves his phone in his office when making coffee (which is normally a much more expedient process, tee hee).\n\nThe spoon may still have appeared in the sink today, but hearing him lose his shit and how pissed he is that he may lose the commission from that client's sale, then walking by my office and realizing that yes... I probably did in fact hear everything... was worth it.\n\nTl;dr: man-child leaves a dirty spoon in the sink every morning, so I reprogrammed the Keurig to not turn on until after he gets to the office. He missed an important call and was embarrassed.\n\n------------------------------\n\nEdit: I think I may have posted to this sub once, and left out a few details because I know I tend to ramble. So to address some of the concerns that people have posted...\n\n- I have multiple legitimate reasons to not care for this man that do involve me, but they were not relevant to this situation and were omitted. I did this because of how he treats other people, not myself.\n\n- I do endorse handling things like adults, but it isn't appropriate to bring this up in this environment. There are two companies in this building, and I am the only person from my company that is based here.\n\n- Regardless of me messing with the Keurig timer, he would have missed the call anyway. He left his phone in his office a few minutes before a scheduled call, and I am not responsible for his time management. He could have easily turned around upon noticing that the Keurig wasn't on. I'm not trying to be snotty, just realistic.\n\n- I was the one who programmed the Keurig just because I could when I started working here; no one asked me to. Everyone here knows that it takes at least five minutes to start.",

        "text": "I have been a delivery driver for a local restaurant in my college town for a couple of years. This story involves one of my rudest customers (RC) and somewhat involves the owners of the restaurant who treat their employees like garbage. (owners).\n\nTo start, as a delivery driver we get paid below minimum wage and we only get tips. The owners pocket the delivery charge although we drive our own cars, fill our own tanks, and pay for our own maintenance.\n\nThe furthest we delivery from the store is a small town about 15 minutes west. The only compensation we get for this “out of town delivery” is whatever the customer tips us.\n\nRude customer (from now on RC) lives in this out of town area. I have never once received a tip from him and whenever we see his order come up the drivers actively try to avoid taking it, knowing we will lose money.\n\nI graduated college so I am finishing up my final couple of weeks at the restaurant before I start my new job. Last week I had a delivery to RC. After he signs the credit card receipt without leaving a tip I put my head down and sigh. The customer asks me what my problem is. I told him that we’ve been delivering to them almost every week for over a year and have never received a tip. He responded with “what the hell did you do to deserve a tip?”. I explained to him that we use our own cars and gas and that I am literally losing money when I deliver to him. He proceeds to tell me that my hourly wage should cover the cost to get it out there and that he doesn’t owe me sh*t. I just walk back to my car and leave, hoping I don’t have to deliver to him again before my two weeks is up.\n\nFast forward a week. This is my last week at the restaurant. One of the owners of the restaurant is working in the kitchen. He obviously doesn’t want to be there because he is being rude to all of his employees putting everyone in a bad mood. The owner goes home about an hour before close. I am taking my last couple of deliveries before I get off for the night. As soon as I get back, expecting to get sent home, there is one last order on the screen. The order is going to RC. After being verbally abused from the owner earlier in the shift and dealing with this customer for over a year, I decide it’s time for some revenge.\n\nI reluctantly take the customers order but I stop at my apartment before driving it 15 minutes west. I proceed to put all of the customers food in my blender and turn it into burger and fry pudding. I then scoop the contents of the blender into the burger box and French fry bag and seal it all back up.\n\nI deliver the order to RC (No tip as usual) and drive back to the store ready to hear it from the current shift manager.\n\nWhen I get back to the store I can’t help but start laughing as soon as I see shift managers face. He asks me what happened and I told him the truth. (Shift manager being a former delivery driver starts laughing as well). He then puts on a serious face and tells me he has to fire me. Because it was so late and the store was closed the customer was given a credit for the food but didn’t receive a new order that night because I was the last driver and got fired.\n\nSo RC got a mess of food soup and the owners had to give them a credit for a new meal. I did get fired but it was my second to last shift anyway and I was ready to get out of there.\n\nTLDR As a delivery driver, I put a customers food in a blender and brought it to him. I got fired. The customer didn’t get his food. The owners had to credit him.\n\n",

        "text": "Removed from prorevenge after 700 upvotes. Boooo\n\nSo my upstairs neighbor had a boyfriend who was SUPER loud during sex. I mean when they were having sex it sounded like there was a Silverback above us. We used to joke that she was dating a gorilla. When they would have their wild gorilla sex my roommates and I would throw sexy songs on the stereo for them. Some Marvin Gaye, Barry White, maybe a little Afternoon Delight. Anyways, my roommates and I realized she was cheating on her gorilla boyfriend when one day we could hear her, instead of him. An hour later I hear someone coming down the stairs in front of my apartment. I totally thought she was cheating and had to check for myself. I look out the peep hole. It was not her boyfriend. Does this make me a weirdo for looking? Maybe.\n\nShe continued to see both the gorilla man as well as the new guy. We knew which guy she was fucking depending on who we could hear through the ceiling. This goes on for a few months and I keep it to myself UNTIL she called the cops on me.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers had just won Super Bowl XLV and we had had a large Super Bowl party. As you can imagine, after they won, shit went crazy. The party was LOUD, in fairness, probably the loudest party I've ever hosted. About 10 minutes after the game she comes down to my door and starts banging. Shes super angry and tells me to keep it down. I told her it just wasn't going to happen but that she was welcome to join us (she was wearing a packer jersey as she was yelling at me). She responds that she is going to call the police. I tell her to do what she has to do.\n\nShe comes down again about 10 min later and asks again for us to quiet down. I just shut the door. The police knock on my door about 30 minutes later. They tell me that they are not giving out noise complaints and that they just had to say they came to the apartment. They then proceed to give high fives all around.\n\nA few days later I hear her and gorilla man having a huge fight. Screaming, stomping, yelling, the works. He comes flying down the stairs in front of my apartment. I have a sort of evil idea. I pop my head out my door and say, \"dude you know she's cheating on you right?\" He responds, \"For real?\" I say, \"Yup.\" He says, \"I knew it!\"\n\nHe then proceeds to run back upstairs. They fight for another hour or so and I never see (or hear lol) him again. She never brought it up to me but after that I would ALWAYS say hi to her when I saw her in the hallway. I usually had a shit eating grin on my face when I did this.\n\nEDIT: Green and Gold for life.\n\nSweet sweet petty revenge.\n\nFor the record, he didn't kill her LMFAO.",

One of the computers isn't communicating with each other. I did my due diligence and attempted to trouble shoot the issue, found a decent starting point. This is outside of my wheel house. I email my boss with what I found and started to pack my stuff up. I'm heading out I call my boss to tell him I'm leaving and he tells me whose coming in on Monday.\n\nThere wasn't an open work order for this yet so I cannot justify spending anymore time on it. I head back to my hotel and I'm going home the following day. I call my coworker who will be in on Monday since I am going on vacation. He's currently on vacation. He doesn't answer his phone. Texts back 12 hours later, 'I'm on vacation.' Now to me, I completely agree and respected his privacy all week when he was away. To me this call was a friendly, 'hey dude shit went down and I am leaving you a turd.' I am walking out of the shop with all my tools. I already had laptop put away and I do not have emails sent to my phone. \n\nNow he's the type of guy who has been doing this awhile and is set in his ways. This isn't the first time he's done this to someone. When he calls he expects you to answer but not vice versa. \nMonday rolls around, my phone is going off the hook from him. I obviously don't answer, I'm on vacation! \n'what were you saying on friday in the voicemail' \n'hey, pick up.' \n\nI respond at the end of the day. 'hey man, I'm on vacation'\n",

I was in the window seat, and my parents had no other choice than to switch me around so I got the aisle seat. Normally this wouldn’t annoy me, but all throughout the flight she was making comments like “haha sucker”, and “you don’t get to see out of the window haha!” Meanwhile I knew exactly what I was going to do.\n\nNear our return date, I checked in online since my parents aren’t very tech savvy; I then noticed the option to change our seats. I placed all her friends in another row (some family friends were travelling with us) and I placed her in an aisle seat; you might say, “well why can’t she switch with another family member?” I was feeling particularly evil so I put her in a row where there was only the aisle seat left; this meant that 2 other strangers would take up the middle and window seats, if I was lucky.\n\nWe got on the plane and I blamed her separation from the rest of the family on luck. Nobody wanted to move from their seats, and as an added bonus, when she tried to start a ruckus again, the people next to her (rightfully) told her to quiet down. Defeated, she limped in her sad seat the entire ride.\n\nedit: i'll paste a comment I made down below since people are asking why I wasn't forced to switch the 2nd time.\n\"Sorry, forgot to add this in the post but the reason why her attempt to move with a family member failed the 2nd time was because it was a nighttime flight and everyone was groggy and cranky. Nobody really had time for her shit so\"\n\nedit 2: someone asked for a tl;dr so\nsister acts shitty to brother because brother got aisle seat, brother switches sister's seat around so she's separated from the rest of our group and she is stuck in an aisle seat\n\nedit 3: aaa i'm trying to answer all your questions\nshe's like 8, you know that bratty sassy phase that girls get? she's gone all out with her emoji purses and cool cat sunglasses and she's starting to be especially sassy to me so it's not surprising she did this",

I had been out for the evening with my wife and a friend and was now heading home late (about 1:30 am). At this time of night I'm far more likely to see foxes and wombats on the road than any other cars, so I'm driving along with my high beams on and just enjoying the drive. It was a clear night and I was on an open straight stretch of road so I was going about 100 km/h in a 90 zone. Nothing too crazy but I was technically speeding. Well out of nowhere another car approached behind me, fast. I would estimate he was going closer to 150-160 km/h. He then decides that I'm clearly not going going fast enough for him and so overtakes me on a double line as we go around a bend. Like seriously dude? I know the road is likely empty at this time of night but that's still dumb. Just wait literally 2 seconds and we are in a straight again where you can be impatient somewhat safely. Anyway he gets past me and sits in front of me for a little bit and here's where I get my revenge. My wife turns to me and points out that I have forgotten to turn my high beams off. I just sat there with a shit eating grin on my face and tell her that I hadn't forgotten, I just can't be bothered to turn them off for this jackass. We had a good laugh to ourselves over it and the idiot sped off never to be seen again.\n\nThere it is, very petty. I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did.",

Now, I am all for sharing but I'd like a simple ask first. Anyway, I went to the convenience store on the way back from doing something that I don't remember and probably does not matter. At said convenience store I bought a brandy new iced tea (as it was hot and I was thirsty) from a brandy new company. I was on a health kick and was impressed by the \"no sugar added\" label right at the top. \n\nOn the way home, I took a sip, realized it was going to take me forever to finish iced tea without sugar, capped it, and put it in the cupholder for later. A quick side note here: the ex-SOs mother made the very best iced tea, and presumably still does, but what made it good was the copious amounts of that white goodness found in a Dominoe's bag. I got home and ex-SO's brother happened to be in so we got to talking (enter ex-SO stage right doing some laundry). While we were talking I got my idea for sweet petty revenge; I placed the tea on the table while ex-SO was not looking, turned to the brother and explained that ex-SO would take a sip of new iced tea without asking whose it was or if it'd be ok, and we watched with glee. On cue, ex-SO turns around, sees the new iced tea, takes a sip, and immediately spit it out, exclaiming \"Ugh, whose is this?!\" Both brother and I walked away with shit-eating grins on our faces and ex-SO was a little more cautious about taking sample's of other people's food. I don't know why we're not together anymore.\n\nTL;DR: Ex-SO liked to \"sample\" food so I laid a handy trap, getting sweet, un-sweet revenge.",

I overall hated it, but this one guy who stayed a YEAR (maybe more?) got under my skin so badly. I had known him since I was very little, but that didn’t make me feel comfortable around him.\n\n\n\n\nHe originally came and stayed with us for “emotional support” for my dad. Won’t get into the details. I was thankful his friend put everything “on hold” to be around for us mentally and emotionally. *Looking back he really just needed a place to stay.*\n\n\n\nFast forward, a whole year, this man is still living with us. He never worked, ever. He didn’t have a car. My dad paid for most if not all his expenses. He would literally sit on the recliner in our living room, at ALL times. I also got a creepy vibe from him. I HATED having to walk past him every single time I came out of my room. For a year I couldn’t go to the kitchen at any time wearing shorts or I would feel uncomfortable at his stares. It just sucked. \n\n\n\n\nMy *last straw* was when my dad went out of town and my best friend and I had the house to ourselves because this guy also was gone for the weekend. He ended up stumbling in at 2 am scaring the shit out of us and obnoxiously came in and ruined our night. He talked a *bunch* of shit about my dad to me as well, which I couldn’t believe considering this guy has been living in luxury for so long without paying a dime and it was all because of my dad’s generosity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know this next part is disgusting and I kind of felt bad about it after, but it was done...\n\n\n\n\n\nI was the only one who cleaned the community bathroom, and I neglected for a couple weeks. To spare the terrible details, there was disgusting build up in the toilet. I took his toothbrush and viscously scrubbed it all over the gunk... the bristles were loaded. Obviously had to rinse it off a *little* to keep this a secret. I nearly vomited doing this. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s my story. I completely disrespected someone’s toothbrush that used/abused and disrespected my family passively aggressively AND openly. ",

Housemate of mine has decided she does not need to clean-up after herself, as somebody else will do it when they want to shower/cook. This is not how I roll, so I plotted revenge in the small hours of the night. It is at this stage worth noting, that this girl is particularly sensitive to smells, or so she claims. Well, I decided to strike on the known weak points, which is absolutely perfect, considering her room is right opposite the toilet. \n\nI woke this morning, to my usual cup of coffee and browse on the internet. Then decided, I would have a second coffee. I will also add at this point that I made myself a huge chicken curry last night, washed down by multiple beers, so I knew something foul was brewing inside me as I slept. It was after my second coffee that my Gastrocolic reflex began to exert a force on my colon, and I knew it was time to implement by cunning plan.\n\nI moved swiftly and decisively to the bathroom, buttocks slightly clenched as this was my 1st episode of the day, and entered the toilet, quietly clicking the lock into place behind me as I got into position for my chemical strike. Well, as is normally the case after a night of beer and curry, the stench was harrowing, and in an act of pure spite I let it sit for a minute or two longer than I usually would. Just to make sure the air was ripe with the stench. I left the toilet with a sense anticipation hanging over me, leaving the door wide( I mean wide, the toilet is now directly in front of her once she opens her door ) open behind me.\n\nThe effects made themselves known within minutes, as she dared to move towards the kitchen, the number of fecal particles overwhelmed her and the sounds of her retching, followed by the frantic spraying of air freshener brought a tear to my eye in a fit of silent laughter as I imagined what was going on just outside my door. She abandoned her trip to the kitchen, slamming her room door and locking it. I could hear splutters inside her room for minutes afterwards, as I congratulated myself for perfect implementation of a plan and wiped tears of laughter from my cheeks.\n\nThis may not make the point, which is clean up after yourself, but nonetheless I thought this was absolutely hilarious, and am planning a secondary strike around this time tomorrow. Unless for some reason she gets the hint. I have been in a share apartment for years now, and cannot understand why some people do not clean up after themselves. But mornings like this make it worth it !!!!",

Easy peasy right? Wrong. My \"Lead\" makes the schedule. Now I say \"Lead\" because she has no actual authority over me. She has been here the longest, and because of that, she gets to be called the \"Lead\" \n\nNow, the 4th is a paid holiday. We all get that day off. The schedule for that day is blank. But the rotation said that the day after the 3rd was the \"Leads\" late day, and my early day. So she scheduled it for the 4th, while everyone was off. Stupid, I can't do anything about it, and she gets away with using the schedule for her whims. Oh well.\n\nQue this week. I'm transferring down to Florida at the end of the month anyways. The week of the 4th, I took my many vacation days and scheduled to have the day off every day I would have a 7 O'clock day. And on top of that, since she is the \"Lead\" she has to cover those many days off. \n\nSorry \"Lead\" Shoulda just let me have my early day. ",

        "text": "Mobile phone post, sorry about formatting. \n\nWhen I started grad school my boyfriend (now ex) decide he will move in with me and we leased a place together. Big mistake. This was an abusive relationship and I stupidly thought that living together would make things better. Six months into the lease, I break up with him. I was so done with his BS that I didn’t even ask him to continue paying his half of the rent. I handled it myself. \n\nAfter that lease was up, I moved into a smaller apartment but before doing so I had to change my internet bill over to my new address. After a phone call to my provider, I realize I can’t cancel my service because it isn’t in my name, it’s in his name, but is taking money for the bill straight from my bank account. \n\nBegrudgingly, I call him and ask him to please cancel it. He goes off on a rant that I’m bothering him, we aren’t even together, I’m pathetic for contacting him with this BS, and “you’re an adult handle it”. I didn’t want to engage and get myself angry. I’ve suffered enough cause of him. I call the company back and tell them my issue, the girl pities me and allows me to open a new account free of charge. I hang up and request the following weekend off from work so I can return to my home town. \n\nThe first thing I do is go to my bank. I explain my situation to the teller and ask them what I should do. The teller tells me I can cancel my bank account and reopen a new one right away. So that’s exactly what I do. Few weeks pass and I get a phone call from my ex. I ignore it. It’s followed by irate texts that I’m a horrible bitch and I’ve fucked him over and I’m gonna pay for this. I continue to ignore him and block his number. I find out from mutual friends that he has been talking mad shit but everyone knows what type of person he is and don’t take what he says about me to heart. ",

        "text": "Rewind about... three years. I'm stuck in yet another class in my major with my first girlfriend, now ex. We'll call her (incorrectly) Christina for the purposes of this story. Things had turned very sour, including her starting fights with me over class presentations. This is incredibly embarrassing, and had managed to pull everyone else in. Subtly calling me an angsty teenage girl, tiny penis jokes, how she's better off, etc. The level of immaturity is astounding for a bachelor of science program. All I could do was consistently take it, back off, and try to prevent the scene from escalating. But I wasn't going to be bested. No. I can be far more petty and immature.\n\nThis is one of our few creative classes, and the final is coming up - we are meant to compose an original 'musique concrete' piece, from the samples we had made/gathered over the quarter. Ambient music. Right up my alley. Everyone's aware this is what I do on my free time already. Friends are excited to see what I come up with - except I hadn't thought of anything. That is, I hadn't thought of anything until I glanced across the room and saw her stupid face.\n\nThere's a program called Paulstretch which, when provided a sample (sound clip), can slow it down or speed it up to extreme speeds, normally impossible by typical pitching/stretching means. So, naturally, I record the phrase \"Christina is a cunt\". A beautiful, warm, airy, harmonious wave of what... almost... sounds like my voice results. And it becomes the focal point of my song. All the other elements come together, and the genre of cuntwave is born.\n\nFinals day. We're having fun. Everyone's brought a great piece, ponderous and enigmatic tones. Even hers, I had to admit, was impressive. The lights are off in the studio, and we're all listening and admiring quietly, save for the few minutes of critique between each one. Here it comes - my song. I'm giddy. It plays out, and I have subconsciously told my ex off in such a beautiful way that she then gives applause, alongside everyone else, none the wiser.\n\nAnyone who might've found that track could theoretically speed it up and be met with the hidden message loud and clear. I had gotten away with calling my ex a cunt over JBL monitors, at full volume, in a professional studio, with her present. And I earned a solid 100% for it, to boot.",

The person in front of me is courteous enough to not recline, and I'm playing blackjack on the seatback screen. Then, I feel a tiny sweaty hand slap my neck, followed by a boy's squeal. I ignore this at first, but it happens again, and again, and again. Each time the boy would do this, he would scream at the top of his lungs, \"GOT YOUR NECK!\" I was getting justifiably annoyed by this neck slapper. I was tempted to simply tell the brat's parents, but a quick look back showed that they were both engrossed in their phones and paying no attention to their child. I did not want to start a confrontation, as I was very sleepy. \n\nThen, an idea formed in my mind. I grabbed my little jar of petroleum jelly and slathered a lump of it on my neck. I usually carry petroleum jelly so my skin doesn't get dry (My skin is chronically dry and cracking). Anyway, there's this glob of petroleum jelly on my neck, and I hear the kid jostling against his seatbelt to slap my neck again. I secretly smile as his hand recoils and he utters an \"EWWW!\" I then hear his mom scold him for touching her with his now grimy hand.\n\nTLDR: Kid slaps my neck on an airplane, gets a glob of petroleum jelly.",

        "text": "I worked in a pizza place when I was a teenager - first job all that. I worked there for a few years when this took place. \n\nI was closing one night and was cleaning up front when I watched a truck pull into a parking space outside my store. Now my store was a shared front of a double front building, the other store being a gas station. I watched this truck with much hesitation as we were near closing and making another pizza was just not what we had in mind for our night. The driver exits his vehicle with two young boys (one about 7, the other 10, so old enough to know what general manners are). As I watched with bated breath as the driver closed his door, crossed my storefront and went to gas station. While I breathed a sigh of relief as the man walked away, the two boys hadn't noticed that they weren't getting delicious pizza and instead their chauffeur went to the other store. The oldest boy grabbed the handle of the door and began to pull it open and at that time noticed that they were led astray, and with that, the eldest stuck his tongue out at me and left. \n\nAghast I began to complain to my coworker about the scene that unfolded, and so we began to scheme. Ideas came to us that varied: Stick your tongue out back. ... No, not good enough\n\nWait for the (alleged father) to return to his truck and ask for an apology?... still no.\n\nFuck it, I had the time to kill now that I wasn't making a pizza. I took off my apron and hat and walked next door. The look on the eldest's face as I approached their dad was priceless, especially as I made eye contact with him and got his dad's attention. I explained simply what happened, and that I felt it was uncalled for, and asked for an apology. \n\nAPOLOGIZE! The dad shouted as his head whipped to their exact location with that odd parental precision when you know your kid done fucked-up. \n\nThe youngest had now hidden behind his brother. And the father asks me which one it was, as the youngest began to shake his head in fear. \n\nI point out the oldest only for the father to repeat even louder for an apology, which was mumbled but accepted with a thank you. \n\nThe strength it took to not look over my shoulder and smirk in satisfaction at that kid was astounding. \n\nI doubt he did something like that again.",

        "text": "A bit of background information: I drive a leveled (not lifted) truck with HIDs, which are brighter than your average halogen, but I've adjusted my lights accordingly because I understand they are bright. I'm in the process of switching to LEDs.\n\nI get out of work at 10 pm every night, and drive the same half hour trip every night. I drive by a lot of regulars on my commute home who I can usually count on seeing most nights, but there are also plenty of people that are random. It's these people that will sometimes end up flashing me with their high beams, sometimes a quick flash, sometimes they will just leave their highs on. Because I know my lights are bright, I'm hypersensitive to not leaving my high beams on and will sometimes leave them on just to turn them off when I see someone so they know I turned them off. But I will absolutely not flash someone back, even if they pull the flash someone at the last second to blind them maneuver.\n\nA few months ago, however, a new regular appeared, and this person did NOT approve of my lights. Every time they would see me coming, they would instantly turn their highs on and leave them on, or just never turn them off. I won't lie, I did the same after a while because I was pissed, but even that didn't last and I just stopped trying and gave up. This went on for weeks, and I just dealt with it, trying to be the bigger person and hoping they would stop being an asshole. They didn't.\n\nBut then, a few weeks ago, I'm heading home and as I'm driving I see an opportunity and an idea pops into my head like Kramer coming through the door in Seinfeld. There's a cop sitting in a vacant lot, watching the road. So I keep driving, preparing myself for the oncoming array of lights that would surely blind me eventually. I drive for a little while, until I hit the longest stretch of straight road, and there he is. Lo and behold, as soon as the car a half mile in front of me passed him, he put his high beams on. So I do the same, but this time it's because I need to make sure he knows I'm pissed. As soon as he passes me, I slam on my brakes, and turn into the closest drive way to turn around. He clearly sees this because I floor it, the speed limit is 55, I'm going 65, and I'm loosing him. But this is good, and I'm praying on the inside that I can have my sweet revenge. I eventually slow down, and come to the area where I saw the cop... He isn't there anymore. I keep driving, and wouldn't you know it, that cop has him pulled over at a gas station, where everything was well lit. So what did I do? I pulled right in there, and despite having an almost full tank, I pulled in there and topped off my truck while facing him. I got out, stared him in the eyes while filling up, and left. I haven't been blinded by him since.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I am changing my bulbs over, other drivers have made it clear they don't like my lights, and I understand that. I didn't put them in with ill intent, and that's why someone intentionally blinding me was so aggravating. ",

I was doing my weekly grocery run, and thought I would try something different. I went to one of the more expensive *food* stores that have a *whole* aisle of gluten-free products. It had been my first time there and it seemed to give me a strange vibe. I finished filling my cart with that week's goodies and headed out to the checkout line. \n\n\nThere were only 2 lanes open and the line was pretty long. I just started listening to one of my regular podcasts and get in line. As I approach the front I notice that the line had grown larger behind me. They did seem to be short-handed. Oh well, I am almost next and started placing my groceries on the conveyor belt. I might have overdone it and picked up a little too much than I normally do. I fill up most of the belt in the process. I would be gone soon enough, no biggie. I pull out my headphones and approached the cashier. Then I experienced one of the rudest things that has ever been done to me.\n\n\nI was next in line when a mother with a full basket and 2 children cut in front of me. She claimed she was running late to pick up her 3rd ~~victim~~ child from school. Now, these kids weren't being particularly whiny or agitated in any way. She claimed it was an emergency, and that she needed to get to the school before pick-up hours ended. If it really was such an emergency, why did she wait until the last minute to go shopping? I informed her that there were quite a few people that have been waiting in line for a while, then pointed to the end of the line. She wasn't having it. She insisted she go first and tried to appeal to the cashier. I told the cashier that I also had places to be as well, just like the 8 or 9 people behind me. I had already placed my items on the belt so the mom had no place to put them. The cashier didn't seem to care, probably a mother herself, and let the woman cut. She put the basket on the side and started to scan the items. But wait! The mother had some coupons, and the organic baby food was on special! After a few minutes, I just wasn't feeling it. I place my headphones back on and left through the front entrance. The cashier barely had enough space for the mother's groceries. I wonder where she was going to put all those items I left behind in the meantime? Oh well, not my problem.\n\n**TL;DR:** Cashier let someone cut in front of me, I left.\n\nEdit: Grammar.",

Sooooo back in high school I was in the theatre program and the choir at my school. This will be relevant later. There was this guy that I knew from the first 2 years of school in various classes (Ben). Kinda had a crush on Ben off and on. We started talking over the summer and became pretty good friends and hung out and did random stuff occasionally. Cue junior year...\n\nSo, the theatre and choir programs did a school trip every year around March. Typically, they would go to a college about three hours south of my hometown and do some workshops and then drive to Vegas, spend a night there and then drive to Disneyland, then drive home through the night on the last day. HOWEVER, this year they decided to reverse the order and drive through the night all the way to Cali. By this time, Ben and I were not quite in a relationship but were \"talking\" or however you would phrase it. \n\nSo having been abandoned and left to sit alone on previous trips, I secured an affirmation early that Ben would sit by me on the bus. I was thinking, \"cool i can sit by my best friend, maybe do some hand holding, and I get a bonus pillow.\" Apparently Ben had other plans.\n\nSo the day rolls around and we're off driving through the night blah blah blah random stuff its past midnight now and then this foo' decides that it's ok to StiCK his hAnD down my sHiRt and yaknow get a feel. I'm half asleep and generally out of it so I push his hands away and am kinda too freaked out that this was happening to me to do anything. \n\nThe next day, we go to the beach and Ben decides that me wearing swim shorts means he can do some more touchin'. Basically this all escalated more and more with me being more and more uncomfortable, but being too scared and not wanting to upset him(dang you empathy), i did nothing and deteriorated into a broken piece of mush that turned off all feelings and didn't respond. \n\nMonths later, (MONTHS) Ben decides to break it off. I tried to keep being friends because ya know I hate losing friends with my limited amount. He then says his parents say we can't be friends anymore. I do the typical cry-till-you-throw-up-try-not-to-die-because-you-feel-so-stupid ish. I email his mom and she basically calls me a temptation so yeah. Skip forward!\n\nRevenge part! \nSenior year, months later, I finally got the courage to tell someone. I had been stuck with Ben in Madrigals (high intensity choir that spends a lot of time together doing concerts, especially in December) I told Bae and she was the one to point out that it was sexual assault. \n\nShe was concerned for me and told a counselor at school and then I got pulled into the assistant principals office and got asked the full story and all that jazz and the school said they couldn't talk to him or do anything because we were both over the age of consent blah blah blah. The school called my mom and told her and my mom took my to my therapist and had me talk about it and I told some of my friends that then start disliking him A Lot. Several people asked me if they should 'talk' with him.  I also wrote an entire essay about the experience for my English class and several disccussion posts my whole class could see(alas, if only Ben could've seen). \n\nI also get a little violent and daydream about beating him up(he's tall and skinny, I could takd him) and do a little *innocent* shoving and tripping and kicking for a few months and take any chance I can to rib on him(I'm good at comebacks sometimes)\n\nAnyway long story short and the icing on the cake was me giving Ben back the shirts he gave me, as well as home made brownies for their whole family and a note telling him that i forgave him. Maybe to some people that might not seem petty, but I've always abided by the rule that living well is the best revenge. \nlmk if something doesn't make sense.\n\nEdit: oops I also told his twin brother and he told me it's in the  past and I should get over it and I just don't really like him in general\n\ntl;dr - boy assaults me so I make sure everyone knows and then make delicious brownies for him and his 11 family members.",

        "text": "Short preface:  My entire adult life people have thought I was a cop or looked like a cop etc.  I have a shaved head because I'm balding, I'm tall and kind of imposing I guess. I'm not a cop flunky, not a gun owner, or anything like that so so there's no \"cop wannabe\" slant going on here. I simply get mistaken for a cop a lot. I've never pretended to be a cop or act on this in any real way either. I'm quiet and mild-mannered typically.\n\nSo I'm driving along on a split, four way road in our town and I'm approaching a stoplight where I see a minivan stopped at the light in the left (inner) lane. The right (outer) lane is also occupied.  A small sports car is rolling up behind the mini van. I watch the light change to green as I'm slowing down and in an instant, convertible sports car guy is honking, just laying on the horn.  I can see the mini van has a mom in it and she's dealing with some kids but she didn't do any gross delay in moving the van forward for the green light before this guy is laying on the horn. \"What an a-hole \" I'm thinking. \n\nHe then whips his car around her to the left (into oncoming traffic) and nearly causes an accident, passes her,  and THEN as the traffic has picked up speed, he is in front the van and abruptly stops for no reason forcing her to slam on the brakes.  I just so happen to be in the right lane and get a perfect view of all of this douchebaggery.  \n\nJust as he is looking into his rear view mirror and smiling (stopped in the middle of the road) I pull up right beside him with my window down and while pointing at him  and in my most booming voice say \" You!\"  he turns and looks at me and his smile evaporates and eyes get big.  \"Pullover onto the next street, park your car and wait for a uniformed officer! DO NOT leave the scene!\"  He nods, takes a left and pulls over and I slowly cruise past and I laugh to myself how quickly this guy's little road rage move went from smile to \"oh shit!\".  I then go on my way to go get groceries.  \n\nHere's the best part, I have to drive by the same spot coming back 45 minutes later and he's still there, out of the car now leaning on it looking frustrated at the no-show cop. Teehee.\n\nTLDR: D-Bag driver drives recklessly and then is told to wait for a cop that isn't showing up.\n\n(I realize that impersonating an officer is a thing but I can't help if others make assumptions. Shrug.)\n\n",

        "text": "I met up with a friend at a pub one day for lunch and a few beers. We sat at one of the only free tables, which unfortunately was set below a television. The TV wasn't showing anything decent and was on mute for the first 25 minutes or so we were there. We ordered our food and sat back down.\n\nTV then was switched to a channel showing horse racing and there was this guy, must have been in late 60s, looking scruffy and quite clearly someone who loved his drink stands near our table at the end of the bar. The TV suddenly goes from mute to near full volume as the guy requests the sound to be \"turned to max\" as he pulls out the gambling section of his newspaper. \n\nA quick and polite request to turn it down fell on deaf ears and so, my friend decided to turn it down by about 10-15%. This prompted a reaction from the man involving wildly flailing arms and very colourful language. Without wanting to cause more of a scene, we put it back and try our hardest to talk to one another over the deafening TV commentary.\n\nWe soon leave, but this guy's actions really got to me. He was so inconsiderate and rude that i wanted some karma to be dished out. Not sure if it counts as karma if you purposely dish it out yourself but I didn't care. I remembered I had an app on my phone that could be tuned to any TV (given some time trialing it out through random chance). As we leave I hopefully try and get the phone to register to this tv. I strike lucky on my first attempt and inform my friend that I fancied another beer and I'll catch up with them later. \n\nThankfully, another group took my table and I sat facing the screen behind the guy just near the bar. As he's clearly waiting to see if his wagers are being filled on each race, I sit there and wait until the horses are about to cross the line and then turn off the TV for about 5 seconds, only turning it on again when I was sure the race was over. \n\nMan gets irate. But doesn't know what is happening. I do this twice more before he alerts the bar staff that the TV is playing up. Of course, I stop during this time and await for to start my fun and games again.  Several more races and I do this again. Alternating between switching the TV on and off and also changing the channel at the last moment. \n\nHe turns and sees me. He gives me the look that I took as he knew that I was doing something, but he didn't know how or couldn't prove it. I sit and smile back at him, down the rest of my pint and turn the TV off on the way out. \n\nTL;DR\nAngry and rude man shouts and is very rude to us for turning down a public TV in a bar as was too loud. Get revenge by covertly changing channel/turning off TV during important parts of his horse racing event using a cell phone app.",

Guys camping next to us smoked their own bacon, and at the end of the weekend they offered all three of us some of their bacon.  Mmmm, bacon.  When we got home and unpacked we noticed there was no bacon.  We texted the other girl and asked what happened to the bacon.  She said: “she who grabs the bacon, gets the bacon.” \n\nIt. Was. On.\n\nMy other friend and I created a plot to steal back the bacon.  We went to her house the next day, and I created a diversion to get her outside.  Meanwhile my other friend stayed behind to “go to the bathroom,” and as soon as the first girl and I were out back, the bacon heist was on.  We left shortly after that, and the next day I flew back home to Canada.\n\nYesterday I was hanging out with friends back home again, not even recalling the bacon heist at all, when I got a text from the first girl.  She called me a “bacon stealing asshole,” and I simply copied and pasted her original text “she who grabs the bacon, gets the bacon” 😂.    I don’t think she was impressed as she has not written me back.\n\n[she who grabs the bacon, gets the bacon](https://imgur.com/gallery/NEXe5LP) ",
