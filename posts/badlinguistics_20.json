        "text": "Comment can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/453du2/tumblr_in_public_university_of_nebraska_sorry_guys/czuuspu)\n\nThere's a lot of layers to this (like a perfect little onion) and it's pretty much in the \"knows enough to fuck it up\" category. \n\n&gt;Yeah... I already have the spiel memorized for this one.\n\nHaha good! So it's practiced *bullshit*\n\n&gt;Generally when you have gendered language, it arises one of three ways. A suffix *change*, like niño/niña, an *additional* suffix, like the now non-productive English -ess, or two separate lexemes developing in parallel, like ~~boy/girl~~ brother/sister (\"girl\" is more complicated etymologically than I remembered).\n\nSo, we've confused gender as a biological concept with its use as a grammatical concept. This is juicy irony considering their later reliance on etymology, since \"gender\" here is more closely related to the meaning of \"genre.\" Furthermore, we've mixed up \"gendered language\" as an ideological concept with grammatical gender. For instance, in Japanese there is generally considered to be a \"male\" way of speaking and a \"female\" way of speaking. An example of this is in sentence-final particles that denote a sort of assertedness: \"zo\" and \"wa\" respectively. These aren't *inherently* gendered, but are gendered language based on what they index (that is, what their expressive content is) and what the expectations in Japanese culture are of males and females attitude in speech. So saying \"'zo' is a male ending\" is not entirely accurate, though it may be the case that it's used almost exclusively by males. \n\n&gt;Guy is literally none of those. Guy is Guy Fawkes' name used as an insult to refer to some ugly person, that eventually lost its insulting connotations and became a term for some random person.\n\nI am unsure how this even relates to their previous assertion. However, \"a random person\" is definitely not its meaning. It's funny how those who think their opinions are \"common sense\" don't seem to rely on it when something runs against their opinion. If there were two individuals in a room, one of which was a female and the other a male, and I said \"hey go get that guy\", what would you do? \n\n&gt;It only later grew \"girl\" as a loose feminine form, because much to the ire of SJWs, that really is a useful lexical void to fill.\n\n[Literally incorrect on this one. \"Girl\" did not become a word because it filled some lexical gap opened up by \"Guy\"](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=girl&amp;allowed_in_frame=0)\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, English used to have informal pronouns. Thee/thou/thine. However, people started using them as insults, so it became normal to you everyone. (I know, this is why we can't have nice things) But in recent times, people have noticed that a 2nd person plural is a really useful pronoun to have, and various dialects have filled the void different ways. Y'all is characteristic of the South, but in the Midwest, the usual form is \"You guys\" used once, and \"you\" implied to be plural after that.\n\nMystery why this is relevant. Maybe they're trying to justify their assertion that \"girl\" is a creation in juxtaposition to \"guy\"? Since they talk about \"guy\" as being a replacement pronoun it might be an attempt to legitimize their pretty shaky opinion with actual facts about history. In any case, it isn't \"in recent times.\" Unless they mean recent as in \"for almost 2-300 years.\"\n\n&gt;So because of guy's history, it seems much more gender-neutral than other words, and seems like a fairly inoffensive choice for a periphrastic 2nd person plural pronoun.\n\nHere's the second part of the real badling. It's unknown why people insist on a word's etymology somehow superseding its actual use. Whatever. Anyway, \"you guys\" is a pretty common word for 2nd person plural. \"Hey guys\" is even a pretty common way to greet a set of people of single or mixed gender. However, \"guy\" by itself obviously doesn't mean just \"person\" (as we saw earlier). Similar to the use of \"he\" in many contexts where the gender of a person isn't known, it's apparent that male-gender (or at least, those lexical items that index \"male\") are considered to be default in English. Can we do anything about this (and more importantly *should* we do anything about this)? I'm not going to answer that, but denying this sort of indexing exists is pretty silly considering. In the same way that saying \"the n-word just means black!\" or \"cock just means rooster!\", you can't seriously depend on some trumped up case based on (bad) etymology and a denial of synchronic use. \n",

        "text": "I'm sitting in my class on aphasia for my speech-language pathology graduate program. Today, we're learning about the Linguistic Deficit Theory of aphasia, which claims that some part of the language system of people with aphasia is broken. And language processing is not under the umbrella of cognitive processing, but side by side with it.\n\nThe professor started out class by trying to explain UG, saying that there are a bunch of parameters that govern languages. In all languages, those parameters can be on or off. Chinese is a neat language because every single one of those parameters is off! That means that Chinese is the easiest language to learn! In fact, all babies speak Chinese before they learn which parameters to turn on for their own language. Also, it doesn't have word order.\n\nIt also pained me when the professor explained that the Linguistic Deficit Model is often ignored by speech pathologists because learning all the necessary background knowledge is too involved. Boo hoo.\n\nNow, it's been a while since undergrad, but I don't think that the parameters in Chinese are all neutral/default? The professor's oversimplification made it seem like Chinese is a language devoid of rules.",

        "author": "Didimeister",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/43348i/facebook_tries_to_have_a_belgian_court_decision/",
        "text": ".. and they're so smirk about it that they've even proposed ridiculous Dutch translations for these words ('koekjes' for 'cookies', 'internetsnuffelaar' for 'browser', and so on). \n\nI couldn't find an English link for the article, so you'll have to do with [this article in Dutch for now](http://www.tijd.be/politiek_economie/belgie_economie/Facebook_geeft_privacycommissie_Nederlandse_les.9725118-3148.art?ckc=1&amp;ts=1453981378). Some context first. Basically, back in November a Belgian court ruled that [Facebook should immediately stop tracking non-members without their consent, or face a 250,000 Euro fine per day](https://euobserver.com/digital/131029). Facebook wasn't amused, of course. They immediately objected, even [blocking Belgians without an account from viewing public pages](https://euobserver.com/digital/131365). And now, they've finally filed their appeal with this hogwash. I quote from the Dutch article:\n\n&gt;They argue that, if the attorneys are asked to use Dutch as the main language in the legal procedure, this has to be the case for the judge as well. So, the verdict *had* to be in Dutch entirely and a translation for the English words was necessary. This didn't happen, so, they say, that is a reason to have this verdict nullified. \n\n&gt;In the petition that Facebook filed the social network offered suggestions how, then, these words should be translated. A browser becomes *internetsnuffelaar* [*literally: internet rummager*] and a cookie becomes *koekje* [*literally: .. cookie*].\n\n&gt;The argument that Facebook as a technological corporation understands these words anyway, is rejected by the judicial team. \"It is a requirement that legal rulings *have to be understood by everyone*\", says Dirk Lindemans, attorney for Facebook Belgium. \"Otherwise you get **a slippery slope towards class justice** (lol). Facebook doesn't want to elaborate on the *'legal-technical'* aspect, though.\n\nMind you, words like 'browser', 'cookie' and 'server' have been part of the Dutch language for a while now. These aren't *foreign words* anymore, but straight *loanwords*. All of the words that were listed in Facebook's petition are listed in the [*word list*](http://woordenlijst.org/#/) of the Dutch *Taalunie* (Language union), as well as multiple derivations and compound words. And when you're trying to say that using loanwords in a Flemish trial is against language laws.. well.. that would nullify pretty much all court rulings since this particular law ([law of 15/06/1935 concerning language use in trials](http://brussel.vlaanderen.be/UserFiles/File/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Wet_15-06-1935.pdf)) has been in place.\n\nEdit: corrected some errors\nEdit2: corrected *all* errors",
