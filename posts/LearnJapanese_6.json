        "text": "I figured it would be fun to do some textual analysis for Japanese learners. Particularly because the game has the original calling cards in-game (just like a lot of other items throughout the game). To avoid spoiling plot points in the title, it just contains the number and not the name of the person it is addressed to.\n\n*Calling card -* *予告状 - (Yokokujou)*: For those wondering what it is, In the game, Persona 5, these cards were sent by the Phantom Thieves to the persons they target, indicating an imminent attack on their psyche to \"change their heart\", i.e. to make them confess what they have done and change their ways. Basically the card outlines their particular crime, why they're being targeted, and informs them that the attack is coming the following day. \n\n(The Japanese word for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE: I am aware Futaba is one of the most popular characters of Persona 5, so I hope you like the post which was done carefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Original text:*\n\n佐倉双葉は、  \n大罪を犯した。  \n部屋から出ず、人と関わらず、  \n惰眠をむさぼるだけの非生産的な生活。  \nよって我々が、  \nその『歪んだ欲望』を根こそぎ奪い取る。  \n俺たちは『心を盗む怪盗団』。  \n己は陽の光を浴びることになろう…その時を楽しみに待て。  \n心の怪盗団より。  \n\n\n  \n*English (my translation, not necessarily the English translation of the game):*  \nSakura Futaba,  \n(you) have committed a great crime.  \nNot leaving your room, having no contact with anyone,  \nyou live an unproductive life of only indulging in lazy slumber.  \nTherefore, we  \nwill completely steal away your \"distorted desires\" up from their very roots.  \nWe are the \"Phantom Thieves who steal hearts\".  \nYou are going to bathe in the sunlight ... please happily wait for that time to come.  \nFrom the Phantom Thieves of Hearts  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Romaji:*\n\nSakura Futaba ha,  \ndaizai wo okashita.  \nHeya kara dezu, hito to kakawarazu,  \nDamin wo musaboru dake no hiseisantaki na seikatsu.  \nYotte wareware ga,  \nsono \"yuganda yokubou\" wo ne-kosogi ubaitouru.  \noretachi ha \"kokoro wo nusumu kaitoudan\".  \nonore ha hi no hikari wo abiru koto ni narou.... sono toki wo tanoshimi ni matte.  \nkokoro no kaitoudan yori  \n\n\n***Notes:***\n\nThe tone of Futaba's calling card is notably different from the others so far, as it clearly is written in a token way. There is no \"dono\" here, and it ends on an optimistic note. Also note that \"distorted desires\" is in quotations. Clearly the Phantom Thieves just want to help. Futaba is essentially a 引きこもり (hikikomori), a \"shut-in\".\n\n佐倉双葉: Sakura Futaba. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. The family name Sakura is not written 桜, as in cherry-blossom, but differently. Maybe not necessary, but I'll do it anyway given who we're talking about. 双葉 Futaba consists of two characters 双 futa which means two or pair (or twins), and 葉 ba (usually \"ha\" alone) which means leaf.\n\n惰眠: lazy slumber. The character 惰 (da) is worth noting for the idea of sloth.\n\nよって: conjunction \"therefore\"\n\n歪んだ (yuganda) is the past form of 歪む (yugamu). 歪 is a \"Hyougai\" Kanji outside of the two official lists. Meaning to \"be distorted\", (even the kanji itself is made of two parts, \"not\" at the top and \"correct\" at the bottom). It's an important term throughout the game.  \n\n\n出ず / 関わらず / -ず : (-zu) is a supple negative form attached directly to the stem of the verb. Good for conjunctions using a gerund in English (without -ing x, y happened....). This is it's common usage in modern Japanese. Extra bit of trivia:  In old Japanese this was the negative form, so it can have literary ring to it if it were used alone (not the case here).  \n\nむさぼる (musaboru): (kanji:貪る) same as before; to covet; indulge in  \n\n\nことに なろう  (Koto ni narou): part of the \"koto ni naru\" grammatical construction, i.e. it has been decided. The volitional form used here intensifies it, i.e. we have / it has been completely decided, or rather: \"we will make sure it happens that.... \"\n\n己 (onore): Despite the character being usually used for \"oneself\", in this context and others, the kun reading onore, means \"you\" in a very informal way.\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nPrevious posts:\n\n[First Calling Card (Kamoshida)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10usyu7/persona_5_first_calling_card_kamoshida/)\n\n[Second Calling Card (Madarame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/114xbyo/persona_5_second_calling_card_madarame/)\n\n[Third Calling Card (Kaneshiro)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1197pw4/persona_5_third_calling_card_kaneshiro/)",

        "author": "KanjiIslands",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11aqfnx/introducing_kanji_islands_a_game_to_help_in_your/",
        "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nThe TLDR is that if you are interested in the game, you can go to the [steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280890/), or search for \"Kanji Islands\" in the App store or Play Store.\n\nLet me introduce myself first before introducing the game: I am a video game programmer from France who at some point got frustrated in their life that they couldn't read untranslated Japanese visual novels. So I took a Wanikani subscription, reviewed kanjis and vocabulary everyday for a year, reached level 60, but I was still missing very important basic stuff so I took a Bunpro subscription to try to improve on basic grammar points while trying to read in Japanese visual novels that I had already read in English. Eventually, I got to a point that I felt confident that I could try reading an untranslated visual novel (it was Kara no Shoujo - The last episode) without external help and succeeded in reaching the end :) But I felt this whole process could have been better and been cheaper.\n\nSo Kanji Islands is born from my desire to gamify the kanji and vocabulary learning process while still retaining the core aspect of farming your way to be able to read Japanese. \n\nThe main gameplay loop is simple, you are shown some Japanese vocabulary and you need to find its equivalent in English (or French) by choosing the right box. But I tried to make the experience more visually pleasing and more rewarding than a basic learning software: in the kana training section, you gain trophies, in the vocabulary learning section, you earn medals based on your immediate performance and you grow a plant which reflects your SRS (Spaced repetition system) level and in the challenge section, you \"solve\" a puzzle based on the amount of correct answer you got for a given subject. Also, it is comfortable to do your review on a smartphone, which might not be the case of other learning software.\n\nAbout the database used for the game, it is handcrafted by taking the one from the JMDict project (you have used it if you have gone to [jisho.org](https://jisho.org)) and doing a lot of sorting, meaning adjustments and translation into French (maybe there will be a Spanish version, if) and can be found [there](https://github.com/laurentdupin/KanjiDatabase) (you can make an Anki deck out of it, that's fine by me). It contains 2150 kanjis and about 12000 vocabulary pieces which are split into 100 levels, the amount per level increases as the level increases. Also, even if you are only trained on one definition for a given vocabulary piece, you can access all the definitions to better understand the actual meaning of it. \n\nFinally, I think the game still requires balancing for the lesson part and some improvement in terms of meanings, so I welcome any feedback to help improve on those aspects. \n\nAnyway, I hope that you will enjoy it for those of you that purchases it, and if you have any questions, please comment below!",

Are there any alternatives to that Bilingual Manga site that used to be around?

        "text": "I've used HelloTalk in 2016 and on and off since then but I have not tried to use the call functionality until a few weeks ago.\n\nSo I decided to give it a try and oh boy lol.\n\nMy Japanese typing and reading skills are pretty good but when it comes to listening and speaking; I have near 0 practice. Anyhow, I decided that if I was going to improve it, I would have to start using it. \n\n**1st Call with a stranger (male):**\n\nHe knows, i'd say intermediate english so he understands casual chat quite well. It was my first call so it was akward but he has a great personality so we were able to connect about a lot of things. The way we practice English and Japanese is that we will find basic conversation topics and try to ask eachother questions. It was rough for me forming sentences in real time and not via a keyboard or phone but overall the call went ok and we played some Apex Legends together afterwards. He's going to visit my city next month so we decided to become english partners once he gets here. We spoke for about an hour and a half. We still talk every few days each week :)\n\n\\--\n\nBefore the second call, it's been about 2 weeks. I spent time practicing my listening by actually consuming Japanese media as I never watch anything in Japanese. Silly I know but it actually helped. I watch street interviews and casual chat videos on Youtube. I felt like I boosted my listening.\n\n**2nd Call with a stranger (female):**\n\nThis person was quite enthusiatic about learning english. Her english skills were beginner so I have to rely on myself being able to form sentences in Japanese and correct her using Japanese. It was a very fun conversation. I thought this was quite challenging as her English was so basic but she still knows basic words which helped out. She is also super playful which made it enjoyable. We spoke for about 2 hours. We still call each other about twice a week. Because of my first call (the male) had pretty dang good English, **I stupidly assumed everyone would have English skills like that. Oh boy was I wrong.**\n\n**3rd call with a stranger (a different female):**\n\nThis call happened 2 days ago. We have a lot in common through texts so I decided we should call eachother and she agreed. She said her english wasnt too good but **MY GOD** I don't think she knew any english. This was the first call that someone answered and spoke ONLY in Japanese. In my head, I was like \"oh shit\" because my Japanese listening isn't up there yet.\n\nAnyways after an awkward 5 minutes in the start of the call trying to adjust to what she was saying, it became more smooth. My listening practice really did improve because I was able to hold the call for an hour long before I started work. It did feel nice but super scary because I was really speaking for such a long time in a different language. \n\nWe did the same stuff as the other calls, I correct her and she corrects me (although she said my spoken japanese was fine??).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n**Moral of this post:**\n\nI feel that everyone should actually try communicating with Japanese people using these apps and NOT by only text messages. Texting only made my reading and writing good. It does not help your listening and speaking! \n\nI've been learning Japanese on and off since 2014 and I have never spoke with another Japanese person let alone called them. Don't make the same mistake as me, fortunately I have experience in grammar and what not so I just need to improve my ears.\n\nI understand people are shy, nervous and so am I. Before each call, I get extremly nervous because not only am I speaking with a stranger but I am expected to be able to communincate somewhat in their language. \n\nPutting yourself out there will help you improve the most. Calling costs you nothing and there are tons of people who are down to have a chat.  \n\nI made 3 new friends who are eager to call me again and again even though we're all learning.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11ace1s/is_chatgpt_correct_about_this_grammar_point/",
        "text": "I just had a discussion with ChatGPT regarding a sentence I read in a manga. I'm not quite sure if I can trust the final takeaway. While I think ChatGPT is a useful tool, I'm aware that it can confidently report false information. \n\n**tl;dr**: Is it true that the passive form of a verb can be omitted if it is clear by context who is performing the action?  \n\n\nHere is the full conversation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Me**: Can you help me break down and understand this Japanese sentence?  おまえが 木霊の呼び寄せた助っ人だな。  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** Sure, here's a breakdown of the sentence:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;おまえ (omae) - \"you\" (informal)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;が (ga) - particle used to mark the subject of the sentence  \n&gt;  \n&gt;木霊の (kodama no) - \"of the echo\" (木霊 means \"echo\" or \"reverberation\" and の is a particle indicating possession)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;呼び寄せた (yobiyoseta) - past tense of the verb 呼び寄せる (yobiyoseru), which means \"to call over\", \"to summon\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;助っ人 (suketto) - \"helper\", \"assistant\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;だ (da) - copula, which is a word used to link the subject of the sentence with its predicate  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, putting it all together, the sentence means something like \"You are the assistant who was called over by the echo.\" In other words, the speaker is saying that the person they're addressing is the helper who was summoned by the echo.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Without more context, it's hard to say exactly what the speaker means by \"the echo\" or why they called for an assistant, but hopefully this breakdown helps you understand the basic structure of the sentence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: I believe in this context, 木霊 is referring to a tree spirit  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** Ah, I see! In that case, you're right that 木霊 (kodama) is more commonly associated with \"tree spirits\" or \"echoes in the mountains\" in Japanese folklore, rather than just a general echo.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, a more accurate translation of the sentence might be something like \"You're the assistant who was summoned by the tree spirit.\" Thank you for providing that additional context!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: In this sentence, how do we know that 木霊 is the one doing the summoning? I'm assuming it has something to do with the の particle in 木霊の呼び寄せた?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** Yes, you're correct! In Japanese, the particle の can be used to indicate possession or association between two nouns, and in this case, 木霊の (kodama no) is indicating that the kodama (tree spirit) is the one who performed the action of summoning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, 木霊の呼び寄せた助っ人 (kodama no yobiyoseta suketto) means \"the assistant who was summoned by the tree spirit\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: Because 呼び寄せた is not a noun, how is 木霊 possessing it? Or is 木霊 possessing the 呼び寄せた助っ人? If so, it would seem like the 助っ人 was the one who was doing the summoning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** You raise a good point! I think the particle の here is not so much indicating possession as it is indicating association between 木霊 and 呼び寄せた助っ人. In other words, it's not that the tree spirit is literally possessing the action of 呼び寄せた, but rather that the assistant who was summoned is associated with the tree spirit in some way.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So a more precise way to translate the sentence might be \"You are the assistant who was summoned by the tree spirit.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for bringing this up and helping me clarify my earlier explanation!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: Is 呼び寄せた passive or transitive?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** 呼び寄せた is the past tense of the transitive verb 呼び寄せる (yobiyoseru), which means \"to call (someone or something) over\" or \"to summon (someone or something)\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In this sentence, 呼び寄せた is being used in the passive voice, indicating that the assistant was summoned by someone or something else. The subject of the sentence (the one doing the summoning) is not explicitly stated, but is implied to be the tree spirit based on the earlier context we discussed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: How do we know it is being used in the passive voice? Isn't the passive form of this verb 呼び寄せられる? Or am I wrong?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** You're right that the passive form of 呼び寄せる is 呼び寄せられる (yobiyoserareru), so technically 呼び寄せた by itself is not a passive form.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, in the context of the full sentence (\"おまえが木霊の呼び寄せた助っ人だな。\"), it's implied that someone or something (in this case, the tree spirit) performed the action of 呼び寄せた to bring the assistant to their aid. This is why I described it as being used in the passive voice, even though the verb form itself is not technically passive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I hope that clarifies things a bit!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: Is it safe to say that this sentence, while meaning the above, might not be using the correct grammar?  For example, if I use the phrase 食べた人, I would be talking about a person who has eaten, not necessarily a person that was eaten.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** In the sentence \"おまえが木霊の呼び寄せた助っ人だな。\", the grammar is correct and it means \"You are the assistant who was summoned by the tree spirit.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Regarding your example, you're correct that the phrase 食べた人 can have multiple meanings depending on the context. It can mean \"a person who ate (something)\" or \"a person who was eaten (by something)\", and the intended meaning should be clear from the context in which it's used.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In general, the meaning of a sentence should be determined by the context and the way the words are used together, rather than relying solely on the individual meanings of each word.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Me**: With that being said, is it common to omit the passive form if the context is clear?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CGPT:** Yes, it's common in Japanese to omit the passive form of a verb when the context is clear and the intended meaning is easily understood. In the case of the sentence \"おまえが木霊の呼び寄せた助っ人だな。\", even though the verb 呼び寄せた is not in the passive form, it's clear from the context that the tree spirit is the one who summoned the assistant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In Japanese, word order and context play a big role in conveying meaning, and often times, the implied subject or object of a sentence can be inferred from the context, even if it's not explicitly stated. So, it's not uncommon for the passive form to be omitted when it's not necessary for clarity.",

For whatever reason it felt like I was almost going over my anki cards in my dream. I do not remember what word it was, but I remember it started with あ. I also remember it was the first word of a sentence card in my anki deck. Honestly, maybe I just made this word up entirely and I can’t remember it, or maybe it’s one of the those words I just can’t seem to recall. Just an interesting dream overall and maybe gives a little proof as to how everything we’ve learned we retain in some part of the brain, it’s just a matter of seeing it over and over again while conscious and bringing it the “front” of our memories and recollection. Since I am still new to Japanese and don’t have an expansive vocabulary, it was still kinda cool to have a dream where I at least attempted to think in Japanese.",

Will trying to greet people or thank people in Japanese get me into awkward situations in Japan?   \n\n\nI'm not under the delusion anything I will sound native btw, but could it lead to the assumption I speak more Japanese than I do? I can't conjugate but I know some phrases. I imagine most any complete sentence said in reply to me will be beyond me. Then that makes me wonder if it will it be rude to even try? To put a native in a situation where they have to slow down or repeat or I have a situation where I can't even sufficiently explain that I only know a few words. I have read that saying I know a little Japanese can be seen at being humble and they'll think I know more than I do.   \n\n\nIn my mind right now, there's an equal chance for them to appreciate my effort or be irritated by it.",

If this approach doesn't work out for me, I might try Kodansha or KanjiDamage or a more vocab-centered method or something else. \n\nSo my question to people who have switched methods is: Did switching to a different mnemonic system make things confusing for you? For instance, if I learn 200 characters with the Heisig/Koohii method but then switch to Kodansha, wouldn't it be a struggle to relearn those 200 characters with the Kodansha mnemonics? \n\nI could be missing something obvious here, but I've read so many posts on this sub talking about using a variety of methods or switching methods that I've begun to wonder how so many of you have managed to do this without getting extremely confused (kanji is already confusing enough for me!).",

My listening and reading skills have improved, my vocab too, but I feel like it the progress of my vocabulary is damn slow, like Im doing something wrong.\n\nI tried Anki again and was happy with the core 2k sentence packs, but after some weeks and engaging in conversations I had the same feeling again: When studying I know the word, when talking I have no clue about it. So I began to drop it. \n\nFrom reading I get a good feeling of which words fit, but often enough there are too many unknown words to guess from context. Or there are Kanjis, which I know and can guess - but thats not possible in a conversation. \n\nSo in the end, I hear and read a lot but dont get the vocabulary in my brain. Kanjis are somehow not a problem, guess because they are pictures. I figured I could try to write down everything I dont know and look it up? Or just take a long list and form a sentence for every single entry? I think writing helps me memorize, but how do I use that properly? \n\nThanks for reading - happy for any advice!\n\nI can not really tell my vocabulary level, but its like advanced beginner maybe. For example, I can read Yotsuba and understand 70-80% without jisho, watch Shinchan and have at least mostly a clue what its about, NHK easy news with their jisho also makes 60-80% sense. In a conversation, there are a lot of words I dont know but in 30% there is a different way of explaining it so I get it. I feel like I lack a foundation of vocabulary.",

I still use translate tools when I inevitably trip on grammar and sentence structure.\n\nI recently had lunch with this friend. She was super gracious and knew I wanted to improve, so 90% of the time she spoke to me in Japanese. She probably used simple terms and spoke slower than she normally does, and I'm super happy to be able to understand most of what she said. But I simply cannot form my sentences quickly enough in conversation. My brain spits out a few words quickly, but I spend the next 3 seconds rearranging the words into what seems like the right structure, and I'm probably missing half the particles.\n\nThe end result is I replied 90% in English (this was a catch up on life lunch, not a nihongo lesson lunch). \n\nMy question is, what should I do next time when I have a conversation like that in person? Should I just spit out my half formed sentences? If you were my friend, would you then form the sentence properly and say it back for me to repeat?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/119hmjz/thoughts_on_the_practicality_of_my_study_plan/",
        "text": "At the beginning of this year I wanted to set a goal for my Japanese and so I set my sights on passing the JLPT N2. However starting from around N4 seems to be a big jump and I am wondering about the practicality behind my plan.\n\nCurrently as it stands according to my SRS apps this is my current \"status\":\n\n* BunPro: Grammar at N4 (starting N3 start of next month)\n* Wanikani: Level 35 (so 96.74% for N3 and 87.54% for N2 Kanji coverage) \\[according to wkstats's cumulative score\\]\n* Anki (3337 Mature Words &amp; 720 Young Words) \\[\\~90% accuracy on all answers\\]\n\nAs for non SRS study I've recently started re-reading Tobira and really trying to understand and comprehend all the reading sections in the book (now that I pre-studied all the vocab in the glossary from my Anki decks &amp; some grammar points in BunPro). I noticed that coming back to it after not seeing it in 2 years my comprehension has shot way up and it's a lot more fun than it was back then. I'm planning on going to 中級から上級への日本語 after Tobira and pre-studying my Anki deck I made for it. I also bought 新幹線マスターN2読解 and the Official JLPT N2 practice booklet to look at after. This is my current plan regarding the reading aspect of the test.\n\nIn regards to Kanji I plan to do 2 levels of Wanikani a month until I get to 50 (for \"100% coverage\", according to wkstats of the JLPT) and for the grammar I'm planning on doing 2-3 new BunPro grammar points per day until I do all the non-JLPT N1 ones.\n\nAs for my listening skills, they're really bad to the point that unless I'm closing my eyes and really focusing I can't comprehend it well. Not all of it is gibberish since I can pick out the main idea in simple conversations and things like pitch/tone aren't too big of an issue. However, the content in spoken language throws me off. Like the last time I went to Japan, I couldn't understand hotel or store staff since they used expressions I've never heard before and spoke very formally.\n\nI know I can spend time watching content to get the skill up but it's a game of: \"it's at my skill level so N+1 applies, but is boring to watch\" or \"it's content I want to watch, but I have no idea what people are saying\". Add on top of the fact I can't as easily automate tracking progress and get immediate (or any) feedback on my comprehension, it's a skill I don't know how to refine.\n\nSo my question now would be, is the path I'm going on a practical one or should I aim on taking the N3 instead? I wanted to try for the N2 since I want to be somewhat proficient at Japanese before I consider moving there in a year or two. However with how much of a gap I have between my level (N4) to what I'm striving for (N2), I'm not sure the feasibility of it while also maintaining a day-job.",

And I have weak arms.\" Weird example sentence, but it serves the purpose fine.\n\nI came close with: 泳げない。手が弱いし、子供の時家族はプールがなかったし。\n\nI feel like this is wrong, though. Because the unspoken subject of this sentence is me - \"I can't swim,\" \"I have weak arms\" etc. but the subject of the last し clause is my family, with the object being the pool. \n\nSo is is appropriate to have two subject clauses in one sentence?

        "text": "I figured it would be fun to do some textual analysis for Japanese learners. Particularly because the game has the original calling cards in-game (just like a lot of other items throughout the game).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalling card - 予告状 - (Yokokujou): For those wondering what it is, In the game, Persona 5, these cards were sent by the Phantom Thieves to the persons they target, indicating an imminent attack on their psyche to \"change their heart\", i.e. to make them confess what they have done and change their ways. Basically the card outlines their particular crime, why they're being targeted, and informs them that the attack is coming the following day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Original text:*\n\n金を貪る暴食の大罪人,  \nカネシロジュンヤ殿。  \n詐欺に明け暮れ、未成年だけを狙う愚劣な手口。  \n我々はすべての罪を、  \nお前の口から告白させることにした。  \nその歪んだ欲望を頂戴する。  \n**心の怪盗団より**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*English (my loose translation, not necessarily the original English version of the game):*\n\nTo the great criminal of money-desiring gluttony  \nMister Kaneshiro Junya  \nEntirely through swindle, you particularly target underage people through foolish underhand means...(so) We have decided to make you confess every one of your crimes from your own mouth.  \nWe will take your distorted desires.  \n**From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Romaji:*\n\nKane wo musaboru boushoku no daizainin,  \nKaneshiro Junya-dono  \nSagi ni akekure, miseinen dake wo nerau guretsu na teguchi.  \nware ware ha subete no tsumi wo,  \nomae no kuchi kara kokuhaku saseru koto ni shita  \nsono yuganda yokubou wo choudai suru  \n**kokoro no kaitoudan yori**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\nカネシロジュンヤ殿:  Kaneshiro Junya-dono. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. Given that the Phantom Thieves, rightfully, consider Kaneshiro with utter contempt, it may explain why they didn't bother to write his name in Kanji, i.e. 金城潤矢\n\nHis last name, 金城 (Kaneshiro), \"money-castle\" should speak for itself.\n\nAgain, note the final title \"dono\" which I translated with \"Mister\" (different from Mr.). \"Dono\" is different from what kanji, meaning \"lord\" implies. \"dono\" at the end of a name is, depending on the context, pejorative, as it implies the one addressing the other with that title is in a higher position. Like a teacher towards naughty student, or a superior at work vs. a junior colleague. A central theme of the game is rebellion against a world of uncaring, evil adults, therefore this inversion of teenagers addressing adults with this.\n\n暴食 (boushoku): gluttony. note the pattern with the other calling cards\n\n明け暮れ  (akekure) : doing nothing but this, \"from dawn to dusk\"\n\n歪んだ (yuganda) is the past form of 歪む (yugamu). 歪 is a \"Hyougai\" Kanji outside of the two official lists. Meaning to \"be distorted\", (even the kanji itself is made of two parts, \"not\" at the top and \"correct\" at the bottom). It's an important term throughout the game.\n\n頂戴する: a nice formal way of saying to take, to gladly accept taking something.\n\nことにした (Koto ni shita): part of the \"koto ni suru\" grammatical construction, i.e. to be decided, to decide on\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.\n\nJapanese word for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrevious posts:\n\n[First Calling Card (Kamoshida)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10usyu7/persona_5_first_calling_card_kamoshida/)\n\n[Second Calling Card (Madarame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/114xbyo/persona_5_second_calling_card_madarame/)",

I was also taking language classes back then and went from around n5 standard to n2 in a year. \n\nMy current concern is that I don’t really have much interest in consuming japanese media these days. I also don’t wish to not spend any additional money for classes. Although I did bought the whole set of shin kanzen master for n1 back in 2019 when I visited Japan, I haven’t touch them yet (I will soon!) Also, there’s no jpn speaker around me.

        "text": "Here it is:\n\nMe: I want to become fluent in Japanese but I lack motivation, how can I overcome this?\n\nBot: Learning a new language can be a challenging and time-consuming process, but it can also be incredibly rewarding. It's understandable to lack motivation at times, but there are several things you can do to overcome this and stay on track towards your goal of becoming fluent in Japanese.\n\nSet a clear goal: Having a clear and specific goal can help you stay motivated. Set a goal for what level of fluency you want to achieve, by when, and why it is important to you.\n\nBreak it down: Learning a language can seem like a daunting task, but breaking it down into smaller, more manageable goals can make it less overwhelming. For example, set a goal to learn a certain number of new vocabulary words each week or to practice for a certain amount of time each day.\n\nFind a learning partner: Having a learning partner can make the process more enjoyable and keep you accountable. Consider finding a language exchange partner or joining a language learning community to connect with others who are also learning Japanese.\n\nImmerse yourself: Immerse yourself in Japanese language and culture as much as possible. Watch Japanese TV shows, listen to Japanese music, and practice speaking with native speakers.\n\nCelebrate progress: Recognize and celebrate the progress you make along the way. Each small step towards fluency is a success and should be acknowledged.\n\nRemember that learning a language takes time and effort, but the benefits are worth it. Stay focused on your goal, and don't be too hard on yourself if you stumble along the way. Keep practicing, and you will get there!",

They claim it only takes about a year to complete the course, does that mean doing reviews every day? Twice a day? Whenever they pop up? How much time will I be losing if I'm not totally on top of it?\n2. When people say they get stuck on a level, what does that mean? Is it that they keep getting things wrong and losing the apprentice status? or is it they just get behind on the reviews?\n3. I haven't tried Anki yet. I've looked at some of the posts and it seems to be up to preferences on which to do, but I'm still unsure. How do you know what to study with Anki? Also, is it for mobile and is that interface good too?\n\nThanks!",
