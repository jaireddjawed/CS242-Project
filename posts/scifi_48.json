The video starts with the guy walking down a tunnel holding a briefcase with a flying drone following behind that he's talking to (or someone on his phone). He's making a delivery. When he gets to the end of the tunnel there's a 100foot tall alien/God creature and he mentions \"I heard it was the last of its kind\". He drops the briefcase and the entity shoots out a projectile which impales him before she dissolves, and he morphs into a new creature. It's animated with some really awesome visuals. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "November 22nd, 2022  \n\nSo, this is odd. \n\nAfter last night’s awkwardness with Mark, I figured everyone would be sleeping it off and this would be a bit of a late day - for a farmer that meant an extra 15 minutes or so.\n\nThe thing is, I didn’t hear from him. I decided to have breakfast and if Mark still hadn’t called me, I’d call him. It’s weird, when I’m not expecting a call I could have happily gone days without talking to anyone. But when it’s expected and not coming, all I can think of is why not.\n\nBreakfast’s a chocolate bar. \n\nI was a chubby kid growing up. And when you really think about it, that wasn’t my fault. I mean when you’re under about 13 or 14 you’re just this ball of desire without any ability to self regulate or think critically about what you’re doing. That’s what parents are for. By the time I was almost done high school I’d ballooned up and was hearing about the “freshman 15”. \n\nSo I went on a diet. I sat down and looked at everything I’d eaten in the past week and started thinking about where the easy calories to cut were, and how I could keep full. Soda, potato chips, candy, and chocolate bars all got cut. Then instead of having pasta and carbs I replaced it with cooked vegetables. Sweet potatoes, lefty greens (fun fact, choy is the Chinese word for leafy greens: bak choy, yu choy, etc.), asparagus, carrots, etc. \n\nI don’t want to get all preachy about this, but ultimately that’s what worked for me. The only reason I’m telling you this is because it has literally been a decade since I’ve had a chocolate bar and Jesus, Joseph, Mary and the little donkey, are they sweet. Like disgustingly sweet, like all I want to do is drink-water-and-floss sweet. I seriously think people must get desensitized to sweetness over time because I’m getting hit by full blast sugar overload here.\n\nBreakfast done, I broke down and call.\n\n“Morning Mark.” No answer. Five seconds goes by with no answer, five minutes, a half an hour goes by. \n\n“Artemis I to mission control - copy.” No answer.\n\nYou may recall that NASA, repeatedly, told me not to touch any of the Orion’s controls. So, careful to touch nothing, I moved over to the commander’s chair just to have a look-see at what was happening.\n\nNow I like to think of myself as a smart guy. NASA engineer, degree in aerospace engineering, but looking at that nice, functional, multi-purpose LCD display, I didn’t have the damnedest idea what it was saying. My “pre-flight safety briefing” covered tool kits and flotation devices, not the Orion’s actual controls (which was probably all on its own a six-month training course).\n\nFor the past six days NASA’s had me doing busy work that I couldn’t possibly mess up - not pushing buttons.\n\nMostly the console is full of buttons I don’t know. “FCM 1”, “FCM 2”, “FCM 3”, “FCM 4”. Whatever the hell “FCM” stands for, it needs a lot of buttons. There’s also, “LVLh”, “Preddt”, and “Por”.\n\nThe buttons I do know are either useless, “Cockpit Lights”, or “Strobe 1”. More practically though they are buttons that absolutely shouldn’t be pressed, “trj clr”, or “burn auth”. \n\nThe problem is, there have to be about a hundred different readings and displays on this LCD panel and after an hour of watching them, I don’t think a single one has changed. They should change, right?\n\nMental math time. Battery status 92.35%. So this is day 7. Just to keep the math easy let’s say 150 hours elapsed from 100% on the battery to 92.35% on the battery. That’s 7.65% in 150 hours, or 0.05% per hour, give or take. That means that battery % should be ticking down by 0.01% every fifteen minutes or so. I watch it. After twenty minutes it hasn’t changed. \n\nWell, this is why people invented writing… Anyone have a pen? \n\nWould you believe that the last page in the emergency procedures manual is actually a copyright page? Anyways, it’s scrap paper now. I record every number on the LCD panel, set a watch, and an hour later they are all, still, exactly the same.\n\nThat’s odd. Bad odd.\n\nNASA’s also still not answering the radio. I check to make sure I’m not in the moon’s shadow - I look out the window and spot earth (that was easy). So why isn’t NASA answering the radio? Why isn’t the command console’s LCD display changing? \n\nI expand my search. There are exactly thirteen LCD displays in the Orion that are tied to the main computer and I record every reading on everyone. I wait two hours, then circle back and check. Every number, on every display, is the same. \n\nI think the computer's frozen.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and\n\nI’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission. You can follow along through my reddit (u/authornathanhgreen). \n\nArtemis I Has A Stowaway is a work of semi-fiction. All incidents, events, dialogue and sentiments (which are not part of the mission’s official history), are entirely fictional. Where real historical figures appear, the situations, incidents, sentiments, and dialogues concerning those persons are entirely fictional and are not intended to depict actual events, personality, disposition, or attitudes of the real person, nor to change the entirely fictional nature of the work. Save the above, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.\n\n© 2022 Nathan H. Green",

Have to love that kind of creativity.\n\nI know, I know, hail corporate etc., but these guys love Stargate, are super dialed-in to the producers and cast, and dug the idea.\n\nWell, they delivered. Brad Wright, co-creator of Stargate, Travelers, and the guy trying to get it rebooted will be doing an AMA on Dec 7th (yes, Pearl Harbor day), in our little corner of the universe.\n\nBuilding up to that we’ll have more AMAs (tba), but for fun, we’re relaxing the prohibition on self-promotion outside of Saturday, as long as it’s about Stargate.\n\nWe encourage you to be creative. Initially we were going to try to create categories, but it makes more sense to see what you come up with.\n\nSo everything is on the table that isn’t abusive or hateful (duh).\n\nFeel free to post your collectibles, fan art, stories, fan fiction, photos, hell, anything that others might enjoy seeing or just stuff you think is cool. \n\nThe best ones will be showcased in The Companion newsletter and on their site and app, so here’s a chance to promote your work to people who might never see it.\n\nBelow is a link for a three free months to their site - they have a staggering amount of unique content and it’s worth a look. If you see people on there you’d want to do an AMA, let us know so we can bug our contacts and see if we can get them to show up here.\n\n[​​https://go.thecompanion.app/MonthofStargate]\n\nLastly, the Rules:\n\n1. Be respectful and kind.\n\n2. [30DOS] should precede self-promotional posts (30 Days of Stargate) to help us find them.\n\n3. There are no day or time restrictions on 30DOS content so post them whenever.\n\nDisclaimer – The mods didn’t get anything for this. We aren’t paid, didn’t get a free trip to Sam’s house, won’t be featured as extras in a movie, and couldn’t even get Teal'c to say “Indeed” so this is entirely for the /r/scifi community.",

        "text": "November 21, 2022\n\nI’ve got a theory I don’t like.  \n\nWhat if there’s a very real chance that the powered flyby we’re doing today could have something go wrong with it.  Alarms sounding, the ship burning too slow and falling ever closer to the lunar surface, or burning too hard or too long and flinging Orion, and just as importantly me, on a course out towards deep space.  \n\nWhat if NASA did yesterday’s training just on the off chance they needed to get me a little used to alarms going off, and following Mark’s instructions?\n\nThat’s a big part of my thinking as I make my final preparations before the burn.  The moon’s getting really big, really quickly, enough so that there’s actually the impression of “falling” towards it - which is super cool.  \n\nThe most dramatic part or the burn ends up being the view.  I’m only 80 nautical miles away at the closest and it’s literally right there.  After seeing the moon as a thumb sized ball your whole life when you’re this close it really looks like you could just jump down.  \n\nI’m going to lose radio contact with NASA as I pass into the lunar shadow and can hear the smile in Mark’s voice when he wishes me a safe 2 hours 36 minutes of radio silence.  He had a joke in mind but decided not to say it. \n\nIt’s a long time to just sit and feel like you’re alone.  I’d never really thought of space as “lonely” but there it is.  Basically, since day 2 of this mission I’ve been further away from any other human being than anyone has ever been.  On the far side of the moon, radio to Earth blocked, it is like being lost at sea.  \n\nThe view keeps me occupied for about a half hour.  I take a look for Webb, not that I expect to see it.  The James Webb space telescope is, on any pen and paper diagram of the earth and moon, just a few inches further off beyond the moon from earth.  In practice that’s more thousands of miles than I can see.  But still, it’s “right there”.\n\nI eat a Skor bar, using my precious - only get one set in my adult life - teeth to grind caramel and sugar into small enough chunks for me to swallow.  And then I read a book.  It only half helps.  Starship Troopers is an interesting read though - especially when contrasted with the movie.  Should people have to demonstrate a willingness to put the collective good ahead of their individual benefits in order to vote?  Or are we all on this ship of state together and so it’s important for everyone to get a say in its operations?\n\n2 hours 35 minutes later and the master alarm hasn’t gone off, and I’ve got radio back.  NASA’s crunching the numbers to see how it went, but they seem happy with heir first set of readings.\n\n“We’ve got a good insertion Alex!” Mark’s got a gentle drawl, like his tongue is in no real hurry to get the words out.  \n\n“You watching the video upload from radio shadow?  The moon looks amazing.  I half expected to spot Webb.”  I leave out the intentional self-distraction.\n\nI can hear the engineers buzzing in the background of the radio.  It sounds like each and every single one of them just got a promotion, a bonus, and a text from a crush telling them that they loved them.\n\n“Hell Alex, between you and me, right this second, I’m jealous as hell of you,” Mark said.\n\nOuch, that hurt.\n\nI honestly thought I deserved this.  It was all I’d ever wanted since I was a little damn kid.  I’d spent my summers at high school at science camps and dreaming about space, I’d gotten a damn degree in aerospace engineering with damn honors, I’d given NASA three years of my life working for them instead of founding a tech start-up (btw. It would have been called Clarity.  An online science repository where studies are organized and cross posted and tracked by topic.  Say coffee.  You open the entry, and the first thing is the most compelling meta analysis of coffee’s overall health effects, then sub articles about its most significant individual effects.  Someone writes a new study about coffee increasing the risk of colorectal disease?  It has to “beat” the other studies already up about that in order to get posted.  The idea is, you want the state of the art on coffee and you’ve got the top articles right there, and you can zoom in with greater and greater detail revealing more, and more, niche studies, but all of them the leading ones.  Science “news” can happen when something in that top line changes.)\n\nAnyways… I hadn’t done that.  Instead, I’d tried for this.  And I got a form letter saying that unfortunately, due to the “keen interest in the astronaut program, many well-qualified applicants such as myself,” didn’t get in.  But Moonikin did?  An empty seat on the one trip I ever wanted to take.\n\nI did, honestly, think I deserved it.  Now all I can think about is how Mark must feel exactly the same way, except he got even closer.  Yet here I am, and there he is.  I cheated and got what he wanted.  Everyone at NASA must feel like that.\n\nI’m such an asshole.\n\nI give things a few hours back at NASA to calm down.  They’d be having champagne and enjoying the win.  Mission control might not even be too crowded.\n\n“Mark?”\n\n“Yeah, how’s it go’in up there buddy?”  He didn’t sound like he’d been drinking.  Probably on shift.  I couldn’t hear much in the background anymore.  \n\n“Can you do me a favor?  I’m going to need a lawyer for when I get back.    Think you could find me someone?”\n\nThere’s a long pause at that.\n\n“NASA wants to keep you being up there kind of close to the chest for the time being.  This is kind of their moment in the sun, and they’d rather not have clouds right now.”\n\n“Yeah…  No problem.”  If NASA were asking for a favor, I definitely owed them a few billion.  \n\n“Hey, look on the bright side.  So far the mission’s been going off without a hitch.  You’re due a mission glitch, and maybe it saves you the worry of a trial.”\n\nThe funny thing about the radio, if you say something, then cringe at having said it, the person on the other line will have a hard time knowing.  I very much heard Mark cringe.  He must have had a couple of glasses of champagne after all.  \n\nBut hey, I don’t believe in bad luck or jinxes.  You hear that God?  I dare you to do something to me!  Smite me!  \n\nSee?  Still alive and unsmitten. Smitted.  Whatever, I’m an engineer not a linguist.  Still… I’d kind of deserve it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.

Then there were more traditional SciFi weapons like lasers and missiles. I believe it was a series, but I read a one-off book. I vaguely remember a ship's captain setting up an ambush for space pirates with a derelict ship.\n\nI know it isn't much to go on, but was hoping someone may have a thought on what it was. I enjoy space-opera type media and was hoping to pick that series up if I could find it.",

Obv he can’t fly, so I thought about him sort of like, meditating and then teleporting to where that hero is, whether it’s across the world or elsewhere. After he kills the corrupt hero, the slayer returns, but 2-3 days have passed. Something like a time dilation. Does anyone have any ideas on ways he can get around? Because I like the teleportation idea but I just wanted to run it passed you guys. Thanks!",
