        "text": "I saw some posts involving mountainous/sloped areas, and want to emphasize run off and its effects! Water moves downward due to gravity, and will eventually settle at the lowest point, going from one low point to an even lower one over time. This water may not be much, but it's still able to carry a lot of trash, oil, chemicals, and debris with it! Even if you live in an area thats very planar like I do, recognize that local streams, creaks, and other bodies of water will transport this stuff, and that just because you cant notice the land sloping and changing in elevation doesnt mean the land is actually flat. If you plan to put up posters or leave complaints to local officials, associations, and/or law enforcement, consider going up hill with your solutions. Chances are uphill and upstream activites are much more impactful than you think.",

Therefore, returning the right vessels to the right producers would be impractical.\n\nBut if sizes and shapes were standardised this problem would essentially be eliminated.\n\nIt must surely be cheaper, less polluting and energy-intensive to do it this way...\n\nWhat other arguments are there against doing this?",

I will mainly be using it in rivers/lakes/ponds I guess but maybe rarely bridges?\n\nNow, the magnet I linked also comes with rope/gloves but I just assume they'll be cheap or difficult to use (rope). Not trying to spend too much but figured this would be a good starting point maybe. Thoughts? Thanks!",

There are endangered plants and animals, songbirds everywhere, fresh air, beautiful lakes, and oh yes an invasive species known as Common Litterbug. I pick up whatever small items I am able to, but there is also a long running problem with commercial dumping (tires, sofas, mattresses, etc.) Even though our county has multiple facilities where such items can be legally disposed of, free of charge, the forest service still has to spend their time and resources cleaning up other people's trash. This pic is some household trash I picked up during a hike a few months ago.",

Sometime it's mostly leaves but there will still still be bags, wrappers etc mixed in.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kZn09q8",
