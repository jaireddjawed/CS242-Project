        "text": "Our call center's client is a pet micro chipping company. People register their contact info in our database linked to their pet's microchip # so if the pet gets scanned anywhere we can provide that facility with the info to get the pet home.\n\nI get a call a last night from a woman who owns a rescue group.  Apparently we called her to do a follow up to ensure a pet was home because a facility called us with the pet. The facility never contacted her as the primary, but rather they contacted the emergency contact (who was the correct pet parent anyway). \n\nApparently, when she adopts a pet out she makes the adoptee sign a contract that the rescue has to be the primary contact in OUR database and the adoptee remains the emergency contact.  Problem is OUR database doesn't work like that. On an account there is a Primary contact, one address for that contact, 3 phone numbers, one e-mail, and one emergency contact, then that person's pets are on that one account.  This lady wanted to be able to manipulate each pet's account.  Impossible, because if each pet has it's own emergency contact on it's own account, each pet would need it's own email as well to log in with.\n\nI explain how our database works in this manner and that she should take it up with that facility for not contacting her. I also tried to explain that she should allow the adoptees to transfer the pet into their name.\n\n**I swear to god, this is what she said:** \"Well if the the pets get lost, I need them to come back to me. Because if the adoptees lose the pet they obviously aren't responsible enough to keep it.\"\n\nThat blew my mind.  That is the whole point of getting your pet micro-chipped in the first place. If the pet is lost without a collar, they can get scanned and get home.  No body fucking loses their pet on purpose.  And she had me erase all the emergency contacts on pets that where on there own account (I had to, she was after all, the primary on all those accounts).  Then I had to give her a supervisor call back because she wants the entire goddamn system re-engineered for her, and because I was short with her (She technically wasn't wrong, I was got frustrated about 15 minutes into the call).\n\nI don't mind that this lady was obviously unstable, I can handle that.  What irks me is that anyone that adopts a pet from her will has lost a good recovery tool and chance that they might never see their pet again.\n\n**tl;dr** Crazy rescue woman basically ensures micro-chipping system doesn't work for pets she adopts out.\n\n**PSA** If you adopt a pet and the facility/rescue tries to make you sign a contract making THEM remain as the primary contact of the pet instead of YOURSELF, I promise you it's not worth the hassle of working with that group.",

It truly didn't hit me that there would be a center where you couldn't, in a professional and standardized manner, contest an eval.\n\nTell me about this process in your call center!\n\nI'll start:  I score calls out directly into Qfiniti, and the evaluation is available to the agent immediately after I decide to publish it.  The agent's supervisor allows them time off of the phones to listen to the call (every single call an agent takes is available to them in Qfiniti) and read over the eval.  If the agent has questions, they go to their supervisor.  Line supervisors attend calibrations sessions with our QA leaders, so they understand the expectations.\n\nIf both the agent and the supervisor disagree with the way an evaluation is scored, the sup sends me an email, copying his manager and my manager, detailing the point of contention.  I am then required to listen to the call again, and submit a form a Qfiniti describing my findings (whether I stand by my score, or I'll be asking my manager to change my scoring/comments).\n\nIf I stand by my score, and my follow up comments don't convince the supervisor, they may go directly to their manager, and if the manager agrees with the agent/sup, they make take the evaluation to my manager directly to contest it.",

A few days ago, this man called because his hot water heater wasn't working and was leaking a bit. Not a problem, we sent a tech.\n\n\nAbout 3 hours later, he calls up, SCREAMING. Apparently the hot water heater was completely broken and we needed to order a part from another company so we could fix it...meaning he was without hot water. He still had heat, mind you. The conversation goes like this (I'm me, he's HWG, hot water guy, and the tech will come in later):\n\n**Me:** Thank you for calling blah blah energy company, this is SuppressiveFire, how can I help you?\n\n**HWG:** YOU CAN HELP ME BY GETTING A TECH OUT HERE THAT CAN FIX MY FUCKING HOT WATER HEATER. I HAVE NO HOT WATER AND I NEED TO TAKE A SHOWER.\n\n**Me:** Okay, sir. I understand you're upset, but there's no need to yell at m-\n\n**HWG:** I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK. THE STUPID TECH NEEDS A PART FOR THIS HOT WATER HEATER AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED TONIGHT OR ELSE I'M TAKING MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.\n\n*At this point, I asked him to hold and I spoke to the dispatcher who was in contact with the tech. Nobody carries this specific part and the earliest we could get it was tomorrow, no way around it. Apparently the customer waited until 6pm to call us when the hot water heater wasn't working the day before...so he hasn't had a shower in almost 2 days.*\n\nI pick up the phone again.\n\n**Me:** Sir, I spoke with the dispatcher and unfortunately nobody has the part in this area, we've called numerous places and the earliest we can get it is tomorrow.\n\n**HWG:** THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. MY CHILDREN AND I CAN'T TAKE COLD SHOWERS, THAT IS CRUEL. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE AUDACITY OF YOU PEOPLE TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN'T GET SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING HERE TO FIX-\n\nThat's when I heard the tech talk over him and said the best thing I've ever heard.\n\n**Tech:** SIR. If you go to Wal Mart and they don't have the item you need, are you going to just stand there and yell at them about it? What is that going to solve?\n\nThe line went silent, then dead. I talked to the tech after he got back into the office and he said the guy stood there and stared at him for a good minute or so (the tech was freaking out that he was going to get attacked or something). And he said after about a minute...the guy started laughing. LAUGHING. He told the tech \"You got a point, buddy. I like you.\" and everyone calmed down.\n\nThe customer even called back after the tech had left to apologize to me, but I had already left. I have never heard someone shut a crazy customer down like that but it was amazing to hear.",

Don't get me wrong the pay is good, and so are some of the benefits, but seeing people get fired for the stupidest of reasons has me constantly worried for my job. Our QA department is in St Louis MO, and they are responsible for the entire company.

After reviewing the qa sheet, as well as listening to the call, I feel (as well as my sup, who is fucking awesome) that it was well above 73 score. I've had my share of bad calls in the past, but when it's up to one person that could be having a bad day to judge people's performance, and blindly judge \"customer experience\" (which I got a 44 out of 88 even though she said that she was going to give me the best scores on her survey that's offered after every call) and say that I didn't apologize for the inconvenience of not having her Internet for online school (which I did do for not having internet, they pinged me for not saying anything about the school shit). I realize that most others have other issues that are affecting their lives with their S.O. and other family members, but this is just my shitty little gripe.\n\nTL;DR: usually do well on qa, shit bags tossed me under the bus with a low score because they didn't get laid last week.",

I'm in the tech support department but 1/4 of the calls that I take a CS issues that have been blind transferred to me from CS. \n\nI wasn't expecting my job to be perfect or even all that enjoyable but the longer I work there the more I consider it torture. I basically get paid to sit on the phone and to deny people from making a warranty claim for their phones. \n\nA lot of issues that people have with smartphones are legitimate but intermittent. This causes issues for me when it's sent to the warehouse and the issue doesn't appear during the testing window. I can only have 2 or 3 none needed warranty orders in a month and stay within target. Sometimes this is possible sometimes it isn't. What makes the issue more difficult is that customers and employees lie. \n\nI've had a customer tell me that their phone always shows no service and then after I order the warranty phone I find out that it goes between no service and 1 bar ONLY inside their home. That's going to come back against me. Or a another tech agent will tell a customer that troubleshooting step 3 of 8 is the last step and that the next time the customer calls we'll mail them a phone. Or sometimes CS agents will transfer a customer to me and introduce me as being in the warranty department. With both of those two situations customers don't want to do any more troubleshooting. \n\nI'm so tired of being stuck in those situations. People call and yell at me because FedEx hasn't delivered their phone yet or yelling at me because their shitty ISP's email server is down. As soon as I resolve 1 issue another has come through. The job is just so tiring. I've only been working there for a year and the job has completely killed my spirit. \n\nSupervisors can go the the vending machine, water fountain or bathroom whenever they want. I on the other hand am tethered to a desk and have to watch every word that I say because it's recorded and I have to use \"will\" instead of \"if\". \n\nEvery word that I say is judged. I recently found out that my company has speech analytics software that listens to agent's tone and word choice during a call. My supervisor doesn't even have to listen to a call to figure out how I performed during a call. This also leads me to believe that the survey system isn't as random as I've been led to believe. \n\nI honestly didn't realize that being a call center worker was this bad.

At 5:29, with literally 10 seconds left in my shift, I get another call (which would have gone to her, as she was next in line). Of course this call ends up being 25 minutes long. \n\nI was fucking LIVID. The next day I confronted her and told her that because she was avoiding calls, I had to take her goddamn customer and stay 25 minutes past my shift. She really couldn't have cared less, called me a baby, and actually seemed proud of herself for passing that call on to me. Anyways, karma hit her on Thursday and she ended up getting a written warning for call avoidance. She's now been going around to co-workers and telling them that I complained to the TL's (I didn't). I wasn't in on Friday, but another co-worker texted me asking if it was true that I ratted her out. \n\nHow should I handle this when I go in on monday?",

Not a callback thing, but a thing where the csr's are told disconnect calls with the clients to get them to the survey... and don't get me started about that.\n\nAnyways, some csr's get lots of feedback from the survey, others get none.  And, big boss decided to shutdown the call center to have a 'meeting' about participation.\n\nSo, about 5 people who had the most survey's completed by customers were 'rewarded'.  They were told to take a break for an hour.  Meanwhile, everyone else went to meeting with 'big boss' to get told about the importance of the survey etc.\n\nI talked to a rep today who was told to take a break for an hour when it went down.. she was scared shitless that she was about to lose her job.  She went back to work after 20 min or so, but was told not to work by another manager who told tell her to just take her extended break.  She was in tears... she called her husband and sister for support while this went down thinking she was excluded and was going to be fired.\n\nAfter the well thought out and discipline meeting happened, she was told to go home for the day.   She asked why and then the manager told her she would be paid for the full day and she did a great job with getting survey results.  LOL... donkeys.  She left with her hands shaking.\n\nI don't know how to say it, but damn, some management people have no idea.  Just the concept of rewarding people to have them in tears thinking they lost their jobs... It seems like I have wandered down the rabbit hole at some point dealing with this type of nonsense.\n\n",

        "text": "Holy Ahura Mazda, TCC.\n\nThe past week has been absolute hell, and not because of whiny bitchy customers, or micromanagement techniques, or typical call center drama, r anything like that. . Our systems have been absolute garbage. Correction, \"my system\" has been absolute garbage. This all started on Monday, so let me take it back there and I'm going to attempt to sum this up for you. \n\nWe use two main systems throughout the day on pretty much every call. One is for records, and the other is for account management, technical logs, etc. \n\nUsually, a call involves me pulling up System 1, copy+paste to system 2, and do whatever is required. Most of my calls last 3-5 minutes, as my department is very small in number and capabilities. We have about 3 call types, so there is that.\n\n\nWELL, we recently upgraded system 2, the one for technical logs and stuff, and while I'm sure it is supposed to improve things, I have somehow ended up with the absolute shit end of it all. \n\nMonday: I report my issues about 4 hours into the day. My supervisor tells me to clear my cookies, and tells me that we're too busy for a restart and to tough it out throughout the day.\n\nTuesday: Issues still going on. Supervisor felt that I wasn't capable of clearing my cookies, walks over and does it herself, and then tells me to get to work. This did not fix the problem. She was too busy to be bothered with for the rest of the day.\n\nWednesday: I brought said issue up to another supervisor, \"Have you cleared your cookies? Maybe you should restart your computer.\" After a brief summary of episode I &amp; II of the past two days, they say that they will look into it. \n\nThursday: I have been cussed out by customers and my +100 second AHT time has rang some alarms. Apparently I am disgruntled, and I am being a bad sport about the new update and that I need to learn to \"cope with the new technology\" I think this is my supervisor calling me a liar. I finally find the email to our technical support for systems, and shoot them a rather long and lengthy email. \n\nHere is roughly what it said.\n\n\"Hello, my name is disgruntled employee, my systems have been acting up for the past week, and I can't seem to figure out what is going on. I have reset my cookies and cache multiple times this week as instructed by my supervisors, and I have restarted my computer during lunches. My systems are randomly timing out mid-work, they are taking an average of 45 seconds to pull up an account, and combining these two, my calls are getting extremely long and my customer's are becoming irate. Can someone please have a look at my access or perhaps take a look at my computer before tomorrow?\" \n\nFriday: I get a reply from them. \"Hello Disgruntled employee, when you are clearing your cookies and cache, make sure to restart your browser. Your systems will time out mid call if they are not used periodically throughout the call. I'm sorry for the problems! Let me know if you have any questions.\"\n\nI don't know how to respond to this. My systems were actually worse today, and I really don't know how to respond without getting fired. I suppose this is what you get for asking CSAs advice on fixing a system. \"Did you restart it? Clear cookies and cache? Do you understand basic concepts like timing out?\" \n\nShoot me. ",

I have a public journal with a tag for the call center insanity (and boy, is that tag filling up FAST), but being here REALLY helps!\n\nIt's 3rd party banking for retail credit cards, so we get a lot of people really upset at \"their money\" and whom don't seem to have a clue about how plastic currency works.\n\nA few weeks ago, I wound up with ALL of these customers on my phone in one day. This is x-posted from my journal - is that okay?\n\n\nLady One: So you guys closed my account because I kept making payments with a closed checking account. Yes, I did get the email after every time the payment was rejected. I just didn't get around to fixing it until you closed my card. So now that I've paid my card off, can you take the fact that I gave you a bad checking account off my credit report?\n\nME: I'm sorry, ma'm, we are required by federal law to report the card as is when we close it.\n\nLady One: Wait a minute, so I made this mistake and you aren't going to fix it for me?! Are you kidding?!\n\nDIRECT QUOTE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!\n\nME: I'm so sorry, ma'm, we can't change the original report. We have sent a report to the bureau that your account is now current, but - \n\nLady One: Oh my god, I can't believe this. I will never open another card with you guys again! *click*\n\nSIDENOTE: It's amazing how many people, when we close their cards, think screaming that they will never open an account with us is an effective threat. We just closed your account, bitch, but go ahead and try to apply for another one. I'm sure the fact that you ignore your bills for six months makes all the companies want to loan money to you.\n\n\nThen we have Mr. \"If I'd done what you asked and I'd let some random asshole into your account, you'd be calling for my blood\" fuckwad.\n\nME: Thank you for calling card services, may I have your account number?\n\nDude One: NO!\n\nME: Okay sir, there are other ways we can look up your account. May I have your social security number?\n\nDude One: NO!\n\nME: It's okay, there are other ways we can get to your account. May I have your last name, state, and zip code?\n\nDude One:  NO! I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANY INFORMATION!\n\nME: (*brief pause*) Okay, sir, do you have a general question I can answer? What did you call in for, perhaps I can answer your question without your account.\n\nDude One: THERE ARE FRAUDELENT CHARGES ON THIS ACCOUNT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THEM OFF!\n\nME: I can certainly do that, sir, but I will need to get into your account to do so.\n\nDude One: ABSOLUTELY NOT. I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME THE INFORMATION AND THEN I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF IT'S RIGHT!\n\nME: I'm so sorry, sir, but federal guidelines prevent us from giving out sensitive account information to unverified parties.\n\nDude One: IF YOU DON'T GET THESE CHARGES OFF YOU'LL NEVER SEE A PENNY! I AM NOT GIVING YOU ANYTHING AT ALL! THIS IS RIDICULOUS! IF YOU DON'T TAKE THOSE CHARGES OFF I WILL JUST HANG UP!\n\nME: I can take care of those charges once you are verified, but I am not allowed to divulge any account information if you cannot provide it to verify -\n\nDude One: *click*\n\n\nAn hour or so later I got a call from a woman who must have been 200 years old and hadn't held a credit card since Sears Roebuck opened in 1886. \n\nDecrepit Excuse For A Human Being: The interest rate on this card is very high. Are you able to reduce it?\n\nME: I'm sorry ma'm, but right now we are not lowering APR's. You will get a notice in the mail if we do drop our APR.\n\nDecrepit Excuse For A Human Being: There's no way this is legal. I'm going to report you to the BBB. This has to be absolutely illegal.\n\nME: It's quite legal, as we are bound by federal law in order to operate as a bank, but we can certainly work on payment plans or cancel your card if you'd like -\n\nDecrepit Excuse For A Human Being: No, young lady, you answer me this. Why are you working for a company that wants to destroy people's lives? You are being very rude! Answer me - WHY ARE YOU WORKING THERE?! Do you ENJOY ripping people off?\n\nME: *I am a deer in fucking headlights.* Well, ma'm, it does pay well -\n\nDecrepit Excuse For A Human Being: If you are working there, you are a terrible person. I can't believe you'd want to do this to someone. You should get a job at McDonald's or something. You're just so awful to be doing this to me and to other people. How can you sleep at night, young lady?!\n\nME: (*at this point I am frantically IM'ing my boss, going WTF do I say here? My boss instructs me to ignore any question that isn't card related*) I'm so sorry you're having these troubles, ma'm, and I'd like to provide you a better experience with our company. What can I do to assist you on this account?\n\nDecrepit Excuse For A Human Being: Nothing. People like you don't deserve to help me. Don't apologize either, that's condescending. You should look into McDonald's! *CLICK*\n\nThis next call would have, on any other day, more or less been a chuckle. But after the shitshow human horror parade I'd had today, I wound up pissed off as hell that I wasted five minutes of my time with this idiot.\n\nDude Who \"Is Totally Not Scamming, I sooo promise!\": I am a shop owner for Eagle Merchants. We are calling to confirm a customer's information. We will give you his account number and then we need you to provide us with his name, address, phone, and mother's maiden name.\n\nME: I'm sorry, sir, we cannot confirm that information to anyone but parties who are verified by the primary cardholder. Is he available to speak with?\n\n\nDude Who \"Is Totally Not Scamming, I sooo promise!\": We call for these sorts of things all the time. I'll wait if you'd like to speak to your supervisor.\n\nME: (*Oh no, motherfucker. You are not catching me off guard that easily.*) Absolutely, sir, give me a moment to ring a supervisor up and run this by them.\n\nOf course, by the time I get back, he's hung up. I get a couple of those kinds of calls a month. The sad thing is that it must work. Some poor, barely above minimum wage chump is giving out this information, and some of these scammers have discovered that they can essentially embarrass these kids into giving the info by saying they've already gotten permission for it.\n\nNormally those calls make me laugh. Today, I wanted to find Mr. Not-Scamming and shove my headset up his ass. \n\n",

My issue was complicated, he constantly had to put me on hold to query information from other departments. \n\n\nI felt kinda sad for the guy. I'm quite certain his employer review heavily depends on sales numbers, and I wasn't buying anything. We solved only half the issues. The company doesn't ask for customers feedback, so I offered to submit a positive review to his manager. Suddenly the reps voice changed from normal to elated. He provided the relevant contact information to email the review, then transferred me directly to the department he was communicating with during my call. He previously said that department doesn't talk with customers (the skeptic in me thinks he transferred me to a regular rep buddy acting as someone in said department), and they didn't \"sound\" like support reps. Anyway, point is that he went the extra mile after I offered to submit the review. \n\n\ntldr; How much do voluntary positive reviews benefit support reps? Will they sometimes be extra motivated if the caller says hes happy to submit a great review of the phone call?",

I don't want you to terminate unless that's what you want. I don't get commission, I'm strictly customer service. I don't want bad things for you. \n\nSo this lady need to reinstate her policy because we non-renewed it. So after it expires, no more insurance for her. So I'm trying to work with her and I'm trying to get the required information for the underwriter, because I believe I could actually reinstate her. The last thing the underwriter needed was this simple question \"Who owns the building and what entity is it?\"\n\nNo. She couldn't just answer that question. She went off on me and volunteered information that I didn't ask for, such as \"There's nothing even in that building since I bought it last year! It's empty!!\" That's something I would usually overlook, but after I heard the word \"estupid\" (spanish call, I had an interpreter) I said \"you know, I didn't realize that the building was vacant. We do not insure vacant buildings and we cannot renew you at this time\" you could tell she was regretting being rude to me. \n\nBut uhh... technically that is true. We do not insure vacant buildings. We didn't know it was vacant and we didn't really ask, but if she wants to volunteer that information instead of simply answering \"who owns that building\" then uh... screw her. \n\nIt's it's not like she was rude only once. She was condescending the whole phone call. I kept asking to make sure she meant to say certain things. Then after a while, I got tired of dealing with her. \n\nSorry dude. \n\nFor the record, I turned someone's $700 collection notice into a $108 refund because 1) the customer was nice and patient and allowed to me investigate the situation. Her mannerism allowed to to calmly look at all the details and realize that technically, we owed her money instead. So I'm not a bad guy. \n\nIt's not like non-renewing that lady would make me feel better, obviously since it's been two hours since I've been at work and I tried to find a subreddit for this. I really wanted to help, but technically, vacant buildings are out of our market directions, so I really can't help. ",

The people who go to collections are at least 3 months past due on their fees, and have assessed at least 4 different late fees (all of which are accompanied by another letter stating the late fee was assessed and what the new total due is).\n\nSo like I said, those collection's notices were sent out 2 weeks ago and this week people started receiving them. So my week (which thankfully ends today) has been literally nothing but 70+ calls a day listening to people bitch and moan and complain and act like complete fucking children saying they \"never received any notification\" of late fees being assessed and commenting on how they've been an owner for 30+ years and have never had a problem before.\n\nStrangely enough, every time I verify their address on file it's always 100% correct and though they're adamant that they've been owners for more than two or three decades, and their maintenance fees have ALWAYS been due on the same date every year, they have suddenly, magically forgotten what day it was supposed to be due on.\n\nSometimes I wish I could make them [be honest with me](http://i.imgur.com/bZvzVdg.gif) if only to hear them admit that they're refusing to own up to their own mistakes.\n\n/rant",

This is a major catch-22 for me, and it happens all the time, and I'm fucking sick of it.\n\nI had a call today where the lady asked me to repeat my name several times- *never* a good sign- and then said that she'd like to speak to someone in America. So I said, in my chipper phone voice, \"I'm actually from Nebraska, and I can definitely try and help you.\"\n\nShe replied that I was clearly irritated with her (I've been doing this for three years; you couldn't fucking tell if I was) and that maybe she'd better speak to my supervisor. Because clearly I need to be in trouble for her own burgeoning racism.\n\nI had a guy a couple weeks ago who *also* made me repeat my name- like it was gonna morph into something respectable if I just kept fucking saying it- who then demanded to know what ethnicity I was. Those actual words came out of his mouth. He actually said \"What ethnicity are you?\"\n\nGoing back to that whole \"saying I'm white sounds like an accusatory lie\" thing, I dodged the question as gracefully as I could by saying \"I'm from the midwest, if that's what you're asking,\" to which he responded, approvingly, \"So you're 'MERICAN-born.\"\n\nYes. Yes, I'm fucking American-born. That's what happens when you're born in America to two Americans who were also born in America and you grow up speaking English with absolutely no trace of any other accent because all your family speaks English and you took Sign Language as your second language in school and so your accent remains as clean and pure as fucking glacier water, I JUST HAVE A WEIRD NAME.\n\nAaaaaaaand then there was the guy who wanted me to give him my social security number to \"prove\" that I'm American. And how the fuck is that gonna prove anything? Was he gonna fucking Google it or something? And the lady who asked me where in the Philippines I was. Not even \"Are you in the Philippines?\" Just straight-up \"I know you're there somewhere; where is it?\" And the fucking lady who heard me say my name and told me that my English was really good, which is what tends to happen WHEN YOU GROW UP IN GODDAMN AMERICA.\n\nI'M FUCKING WHITE. IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE REALLY CONVENIENT IF I WASN'T, 'CAUSE I COULD BE STERN AND INDIGNANT ABOUT HOW I'M A PROUD LATINA WOMAN AND I WON'T BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT.

        "text": "Over the last 1.5 years, my call center has slowly changed. Most notably, our call volume has increased dramatically, to the point where we now take back-to-back calls all day long, all year long. There's no slow season anymore. I took as many calls on a \"slow day\" this winter as I used on on previous Black Fridays. I confronted an area manager about it and she laughed, saying \"haven't you ever worked in a call center before?\"\n\nEven if that kind of volume is common, it does us no good. We relay on having veteran agents who have been here since before the days of Smartphones. I'm going on 4 years and I'm the newbie on my team. But hey, if they want to have typical call volume, they can also have the typical churn rate too.\n\nEDIT: Well, I guess it's good to know that I'm in good company. ",

        "text": "I work in a call center dealing with credit card maintenance, and today was just the kind of day where I had zero patience or sympathy for anyone on the other end of my phone. Two calls in particular stand out for me from today.\n\nFirst, we have Clueless Girl, or CG. CG called in to make a payment but was having a hard time with the IVR. Fine, whatever. I can help you make a payment! Will we be using either of these checking accounts we have on file? No? Okay, I can take down the routing number and account number you'd like to use! Here's where things fell apart...\n\nCG: I'm not using a checking account. I want to pay with another card.\n\nMe: Unfortunately we don't accept cards as a form of payment, we would need a checking or savings account number with a routing number.\n\nCG: Well I don't have any money in those accounts. I want to use my credit card.\n\nMe: Like I said, I cannot process a payment using a card number.\n\nCG: Well why not? Why can't you use a credit card!?\n\nMe: That's just the way it is, there's no way for me to enter a card number for a payment.\n\nCG: Well then what am I supposed to do? I don't get paid for a couple of weeks, and it was due yesterday! What can you do to help me!?\n\nMe: (internally screaming) There's really nothing that I can do for you here. You'll have to make a payment once you get paid.\n\nCG: Well can you at least waive the late fee or something? I've tried calling several times over the last week to make a payment and I keep running into the same issue! \n\nMe: So you've been told multiple times that we don't take credit cards for payment then.\n\nCG: (Something something waive the fee because I \"tried\")\n\nMe: (Looking at fees, see about 5 late fees in recent history) Okay, I can go ahead and reverse ONE of your recent late fees.\n\nCG: ...\n\nMe: Anything else?\n\nCG: ... No.\n\n\n\nSecond was actually a call from a banker. For the banker calls I take, we're required to verify their name, branch phone number, and a specific code assigned to each bank by my company(we work with a lot of different FIs). This is how we make sure that they're not just some rando calling to cause mayhem. Today this banker calls in, and she is immediately on the defensive when I ask for her bank's code. We'll call her Bitchy Banker, or BB.\n\nBB: I don't have one of those.\n\nMe: ... Okay, you don't know your code?\n\nBB: No. \n\nMe: Okay, without that code I wouldn't be able to access this account for you.\n\nBB: This is ridiculous, I work at SomeBank, we're located at Address, I can tell you our phone number or whatever else you want.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but without that code -\n\nBB: Okay so how can I get the code then?\n\nMe: I can get you in touch with someone in another department who can help you get that if you don't mind holding a moment.\n\nBB: Seriously? You're the fourth person I've talked to already!\n\nMe: Well I'm very sorry but if we're going to get anything taken care of in this account we need to do this step first.\n\nBB: Okay, fine.\n\n**Call over to other department, explain situation to rep, conference together**\n\nMe: Okay BB, I have HelpDepartment(HD) on the line. She's going to help you get that code, and I'll hang on the line so we can work on this account after. Okay?\n\nBB: (Perking up slightly) Okay, thanks!\n\nHD: Hi, do you have a login for xx system?\n\nBB: No.\n\nHD: Okay, then do you have a (document) nearby or available?\n\nBB: No.\n\nHD: ... Hmm.. Is there a coworker around that might be able to help you with this kind of information?\n\nBB: No. Nobody knows anything about this code.\n\nHD: Okay, well without any of these things it's impossible for me to verify you, so we really can't help you.\n\nBB: This is so inconvenient. This keeps happening, and I can't help my customers!\n\nHD: Well I'm very sorry but you have to understand that with privacy laws we really have to be able to verify who you are if we're going to work on an account with you.\n\nBB: (voice dripping with disdain) Yeah, I understand privacy issues. I'm a banker. This is still really inconvenient. I have a customer in front of me and you won't let me help them.\n\nHD: Well again, I'm sorry. You'll need to have your branch manager figure out this situation with the code.\n\nBB: Okay fine. Bye.\n\nHD and I agreed that it was an odd phone call and went on our merry ways. Don't act like you understand how important privacy is and get mad at us for enforcing those policies at the same time! Extra stupid is that the customers could probably just call in themselves on the normal CS line and accomplish whatever she was trying to do. :| She never really game an opportunity to suggest that, though. Oh well!\n\n",

        "text": "Background: I work for an alarm company, I'm sharing some of my favorite stories from the past year of working there.\n\nThis story is from when I was taking inbound calls from field technicians. It spans a series of calls from two different technicians.\n\n\nSo, when our technicians go out to do an installation, they are allowed to \"upgrade\" a customer, to get them to pay more per month than the sales rep got them to agree upon by showing them fancy equipment and convincing them they need it. One technician went out to a house to install, tried to upgrade, and immediately was told \"No\" very firmly. Husband and wife, both lawyers, not about to fall for a second sales pitch for the same equipment. And, this is where things start to fall apart. \n\n\nThe technicians can make copious amounts of money from upgrades, a hefty upgrade on one install can earn them more money for that one job than I make in a week. So, when the tech was shut down from upgrading, he started to get an attitude with the customer. He was allegedly huffing under his breath around their house, shutting doors a bit too hard, and rolling his eyes. The customer confronted him, asking him if there was a problem. The technician then snapped at him, requesting to be left alone to complete the installation.\n\n\nNow, I'm not sure if you've ever been a total stranger in someone's home, then requested the homeowner \"leave you alone\". As I'm sure you can imagine, it tends not to go very well. The customer grew angry, and requested he leave the home. The technician refused to leave, he said he had to finish the installation before he left. So, the customer's wife called the police. \n\nOur technician was escorted off the property, and we were unable to reach him after that. So, what did we do? We had the nerve to send another technician out to complete the install. The guy we sent in to finish up, he's not one of our best. He was setting up a \"smart\" thermostat we offer, and he managed to fry two of them from messing with the customer's existing HVAC system. So, he leaves the site, and promises the customer we'd come back on Monday to finish the installation. That was in mid-February. We haven't reached out to the customer since then, nor have they called us. There's a few hundred dollars worth of our equipment in their home, and we have not collected any payment for it, nor do we have a contract signed from them. And, something tells me we won't be able to convince them to sign, when that day eventually comes. ",

        "text": "Well, kids, I've survived. I made this account during my second week in a call center, and in the past year, I've been shuffled from Customer Service (where I originally started) to a sub-department that handled calls from field technicians and made some outbound calls to customers regarding service appointments, then to yet another department, this one completely outside of Customer Service. First we took calls from field technicians (which was rad as hell because they're some pretty chill people) but now they don't call into us anymore, we are a strictly outbound department. Completely the opposite of what I was hired for, calling outbound gives me hella anxiety. Also, I didn't apply for or request any transfers, they just kind of happened to me. \n\n\nIn that time, I've gotten a $1 raise, I currently make 40 cents above minimum wage. There's been a steady stream of bullshit at this company since mid-July 2015, including managers I used to like on power trips, layoffs of people fundamental to the company's operation, and a series of poor business decisions from the wealthy executives, and lately, requesting for employees to falsely write reviews for the company's products pretending to be customers. \n\nBut, I digress. I'd like to share with you all some of my favorite tales from this call center from the past year. (Alarm company)\n\n*The Ghosts*\n\nCustomer calls in, explaining to us she wants her system removed. Of course, we ask her how come, and ask if there's anything we can do to help her. She then explains further that she doesn't like how the ghosts can watch her through the image motion detectors. The image motion detectors take snapshots of movement in front of them only when the alarm is set, so, unless she's setting the alarm and wandering around her house to set it off, there are no snapshots being taken of her. I can say with a level of certainty that ghosts are definitely not involved here. Lo and behold, we convince her to keep the system by setting a service appointment to take down the image motion detectors so 'the ghosts' won't see her anymore. \n\nAt the service appointment, the technician sent us an email with the results. I'll paraphrase for clarity.\n\n'I retrained the customer, she is very paranoid...she thought the image sensor made images appear...images of ghosts she has seen...I advised her they only take pictures and she was ok with keeping them.'\n\nSo, it turned out the problem was not the fear of ghosts seeing her, she was under the impression the sensors were causing ghosts to appear. We haven't heard from her since then, at least.\n\n*****************************************************\nI decided to separate the posts, as this one got really long already.",

I used to love getting things up and running for customers too, but the job can definitely bring on some bitterness. What I always found fun was solving issues, but customers just want it to work with as little work as possible which is definitely understandable since at times, their businesses rely on it to work flawlessly. \n\n Now, I have a bunch of expensive equipment chilling in the house that I just use to browse Reddit and check out Imgur. I don't even want to program any more which is what I went to school for.  Gaming isn't as fun as it used to be, because I really don't want to mess around with my gaming PC to make (insert console port here) run properly. Not to mention, looking at a computer screen for the majority of my life doesn't seem to healthy either! So, I have this feeling of guilt hanging over me too.

Here is one of my all time favorites: \n\nI spent three years working for a cable company and no it's not the one you are thinking of. I started in sales and the company forced us to be customer complaints, bill increases, disconnections, and general customer service. I'm talking the worst of the worst. \nWell one day I had a lady from the deep south on my phone, asking why her bill had gone up. I explained that her promo had ended and all the general answers we were supposed to give and that sorry there are no more specials available. She didn't believe and asked for a manager. I replied with \"I can definitely get you a manger but they are going to say the exact same thing and there is at least a 10 minute wait.\" Which is what we were forced to say by management. She got quite for a couple of seconds and screamed \"Oh Lord, you are doing this on purpose.... You're an evil child. You are the Devil's child....You are the spawn of Satan!!!!\" and proceeded to say \"oh Lord help me\" over and over again (at least 6 times in a row). I pushed my mute button and laughed so hard until my stomach hurt. I had to calm myself from laughing and ask her if she wanted to wait on hold. She said \"F*** you, stupid white bitch\" and hung up which made me laugh more. All my coworkers ended up calling me Satan's child for the rest of the week. \n\nTLDR; Lady's bill went up, she called me the Devil's child and cussed me out all over a $5 a month increase.",

Both times someone eventually got back to me, usually hours later. \n\nWe have non CC departments as well and as far as I know this policy only applies to the CC. \n\nIf I did get disciplined after following the steps above and I took it to HR,  what do you think HR would have to say? Would they support the policy or push it back as unnecessary and unreasonable? \n\nThis is a company that is proud of/likes to promote itself as being very employee-friendly etc but I feel this policy is basically setting employees up to fail/be disciplined since we have zero control over someone actually answering the phone.

        "text": "I've posted several times in the past here, but this is my first one from my new job. I work after delivery customer care for a furniture company in California.\n\nOn my board right now I see in the past week our calls are hovering between 12-20 a day. We do probably twice that in e-mails, so compared to my last job this is a breeze and I love it.\n\nThis is my first legitimately *confusing* call I've had since I started here. \n\n\n---------\n\nCust: Your delivery guys are trying to deliver an ugly table!\n\n\nMe: Alright. What's wrong with it?\n\n\nCust: It's way more distressed than the one in the store! I mean I didn't even have a custom made table, I ordered one exactly like what I saw in the store!\n\n\nMe: Well, they are still made to order. You'll never get one exactly like the one in the store unless you buy the one off the floor. Did you buy the one off the floor? \n\n\n--- Floor samples have no warranty, had to ask ---\n\n\nCust: What? They never told me that. I see... well, I need to refuse it and get my money back, how can I do that?\n\n\nMe: The store would have to authorize that, I'm sorry. I'm after delivery service, I can help get issues corrected but I can't do anything with money. Have you contacted your salesperson yet?\n\n\nCust: Yes and they gave me your number.\n\n\nMe: I see. Do you have the order number?\n\n\nCust: (some string of numbers that makes no sense to me).\n\n\nMe: Hm. That is not a number we would use. What's your name and address?\n\n\nCust: (name and address)\n\n\nMe: I see an order from 2011, but nothing recent. Are you sure you purchased from (company name)?\n\n\nCust: Yes! In Arizona. I placed my order at a store there and they told me it would go through the (local) store.\n\n\nMe: Hm. I should still be able to see it though. I tell you what, give me your phone number and I'll call the store here and see what they can tell me. I'll call you right back.\n\n\n--- First, I went and spoke to the delivery company here. They have no one in the (city she's in) area today. Then I called the store and they know nothing either. Cool. About 5 minutes passed ---\n\n\nMe: Hello, just got off the phone with the store and done speaking with the delivery company here. We're at a loss as no one at the (local) store knows anything about this order, I can't see it, and the delivery company I work with isn't in that area today.\n\n\nCust: So? I see delivery guys right here!\n\n\nMe: What company are they with?\n\n\nCust: Yours!\n\n\nMe: We use (delivery company) for all local deliveries. You're local, but they have no one in your area today, so I'm a bit confused.\n\n\nCust: Well I called (phone number) to confirm the timeframe. Is that your number?\n\n\n--- Hooray Google! ---\n\n\nMe: Oh! That's (other delivery company) that usually only does things for us out of our local area.\n\n\nCust: What?\n\n\nMe: I think what happened is the Arizona store did a drop ship instead of routing the order through a local store for you. I can't see anything on your order because they kept the order instead of giving it to a store more local to where you live.\n\n\nCust: What?\n\n\nMe: You'll need to call the store in Arizona, they're the only ones that can authorize a return at this point. \n\n\nCust: Fine. You'll probably hear from me on YELP!\n\n\nMe: I hope they're able to help, have a nice day.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nI'll never understand people like that. I didn't sell you the table, you bought it from another store (a separate franchise in another *state*) and then want to bash me personally on Yelp because I sorted out how you can sort it out? Thanks lady.\n\nFortunately my boss will probably frame it and put it on the wall so we can laugh about it later.\n\nThe reason the store in Arizona would do this is greed. If it's sold outside their service area, this customer will have a hell of a time getting any warranty service done on it if it needed it, but they get the commission. Sigh...",

They're constantly monitoring us and come around eyeing us down to see if we're doing our jobs and some of us are getting put on probation because we aren't meeting our quality but how is that expected of us if we haven't had a side by side with our manager in 6 months? I transferred to this department after being in customer service for a year and now I handle credit card applications and deal with retail workers and it's like every single call is me being screamed at along with management despising me. Plus I'm on FMLA for my anxiety so I can leave once a week but I feel like they're always questioning me (in a way) about it and give me a hard time. I've applied for 10 other departments and customer service was hard but atleast I had supportive managers who helped me every step of the way this is just getting ridiculous along with coworkers talking behind your back. I just don't see anything positive in my job and lately have been disconnecting calls and going into aftercall to kinda just.....cry for a minute. I snap back quickly but the stress is just getting ridiculous. I've been with the company for two years and I tried calling HR on my manager and basically they played a game of he said she said and pulled me into her office and practically called me a liar and I just don't feel secure. I don't like talking to them when I have a problem. If my system goes down....well I just message a random manager from some other department or figure it out on my own. I feel like I'm powerless and yeah I make $17 an hour but at the cost of my sanity. I really don't want to leave the company I don't hate the work I do but it's almost impossible to work in a call center with such a shit manager -_-",

        "text": "Obligatory \"long time lurker, first time poster\" spiel and a little background. I take orders for numerous catalog companies all of which are women's clothing with exception to our one men's and our few home/linens catalogs. \n\nSo today I had this dude’s wife call to explain that her husband has a condition and his medications side effect caused him to develop boobs and she was looking into getting him bras. I was understanding and in the most professional way possible said something much more tame and along the lines of, “cool, can do! boobs without support can be a bitch!” Well turns out she wasn’t even getting him bras, he already has them. I asked what I could help her with and she said she was looking to get her husband more feminine clothing. She explained than another side effect of his medication caused him to develop wider hips and he was petite to begin with. So this whole ordeal is overall humiliating for him which has basically causes him to be holed up in the house. Now being a sympathetic person that I am, I felt for him. It sounded awful and if I was in his position I wouldn’t have any idea what to do either.\n\nShe then goes on to explaining that she and her doctor thought that he may become more confident if he wore more flattering clothes. That’s a little out there, but I guess it made sense. She ends up giving me all of his measurements and while doing so she was going on about how he has nice wide hips and a nice ass that are very proportionate to his size. She sounded kind of envious when she was explaining it. I kind of shrugged it off thinking I was probably reading to much into things, as I tend to do. I was a little off put when she began to give me item numbers for item numbers for styles that she preferred (which were VERY feminine.) However, at the time I was under the impression he was in agreement on the style of his new wardrobe. She then told me that her, her doctor and her friend thought it would be much easier easing her husband into the idea of wearing women’s clothing if he received encouragement from an outside source, which you guess it is ya boy the poor rep on the other end of the sales call. Now this is where I began to feel super uncomfortable seeing as he wasn’t willingly getting women’s clothes and it seemed as if he didn’t even have a say in anything he was getting. I was just supposed to be his personal shopper and pick out these very feminine clothes and he was just going to pull them on our website while I explained them, answered any questions and then just was supposed to add it to his order. I was supposed to do all of this with no regard to his opinion because he was “overwhelmed and didn’t know where to start.” \n\nI felt so bad because she wouldn't even let him ease into the idea of wearing women's clothing she was throwing him in head first with having me find him dresses, blouses, pantsets, handbags, jewelry and make up to compliment his new ensembles. I was very uncomfortable so I mentioned to her that maybe instead of going for super feminine clothes he should try plain, basic things to ease him into the idea of wearing women’s clothing. Nope! He has to go all out, \"this isn't about comfort. we'll focus on that later.\" WHAT THE FUCK. It was all becoming more blatantly clear as the call went on that this woman was straight up using her husband as a live dress up doll - especially after I recalled how envious she sounded of his new figure.\n\nIt was game over once she handed the phone over to her husband to speak with me. He was obviously shy and stated numerous times how uncomfortable and embarrassed he was about his situation. I felt for him, his wife was crazy. Despite my better judgement I pushed through and gave him item suggestions to look up and ended up adding anything to his order I was as feminine and would display his figure. A few times I asked him to put his wife back on to make sure everything I added was to her standards. Some were, some we’re, but it wasn’t a big deal. She was more concerned over the fact that I described things as feminine which wasn’t easing him into the idea of dressing in women’s clothing. Fair enough, I apologized and she didn’t make a big fuss about it. After she handed the phone back to her husband it was the same as earlier. I would go back and forth between the two, rinse and repeat.\n\nNearly 30 minutes into the call and +$1,200 into the order the call (thankfully) disconnected and I called back twice, but no one ended up answering. I felt so bad for this poor guy, it was painfully obvious that this wasn't idea let alone he was on board with the plan his wife, doctor and wife's friend hatched. Would have been a whole other story if he was on board. I digress, it was a long day after that.",

        "author": "MzTerri",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/4byk9v/my_two_best_ever_call_center_calls_cables_out_on/",
        "text": "Okay- I worked for two different answering services handling high volume accounts for about three hundred people, so while we got our share of abusive calls (mostly from the Doctors who were our actual customers), these two stand out in my mind simply because I'd already reached the point where I was at \"Fuck this place O'Clock\" and planning my escape. I was an evening supervisor at this company, and I was so grateful to get out I could've cried.\n\n1. Superbowl Sunday.\nWe answered for a very large cable company that is slang for the male anatomy as one of our customers. On Superbowl Sunday the power went out. This was back in the day when you didn't have to have anything special to watch basic cable, you could simply get the main channels for nothing by using the air waves. Simple enough, right? Well, not for Mr. Bossman. Mr. Bossman called in and right off of the bat got belligerent at me, because he was paying for cable and he wanted to watch the Superbowl! I explained to him that unfortunately there was a major outage for his entire area, and while techs were working on getting the cable back up, there was no guarantee on a length of time. I also reminded him that the show was on a channel that he could get without cable, so all he would have to do would be disconnect the box and he could continue watching the game.\n\nNOT. GOOD. ENOUGH.\n\nMr. Bossman then proceeds to tell me that he doesn't WANT to watch the game on tv without cable, he ONLY wants to see it with cable (seriously, this was not a time of DVR, or high def, there was NO bonus to it being on cable other than maybe he didn't want to unscrew the little wire). He decides to tell me then that he pays my salary (at 7.25$ an hour) and that I will do what the fuck he tells me to do. I proceed to tell him that he does not pay me enough to listen to being treated that way, and repeat what I'd said about there being a tech working on the situation OR unplugging.\n\nOf course, in the line of entitled customers everywhere- the next line is... say it with me folks...\n\n\"I DEMAND to speak to THE SUPERVISOR\".\n\nGuess what pal, you've got her. Nope you still don't pay me enough. A bit more swearing and I tell him that he can keep the three cents of his that might go towards my salary that month, and we'll call it even, and hang up on him.\n\n2. \"You're going to get me RAPED!\"\n\nWe also dealt with apartment complex after hours maintenance repairs. Several of these accounts were known as \"Fire, Flood, or Blood\" accounts, meaning you ONLY call someone if there was a fire, flood, or bloodshed on the property. Period. Sometimes it'd even depend on the severity of the fire, flood, or blood. Like oh yes, just a tiny pipe leak? Leave it- why are you bothering me for that? It'll be a nice puddle in the morning and we'll deal with it then.\n\nSo I get a call from a lady, probably late twenties or early thirties, who tells me that she'd opened her window, and upon going to put it back down, it jammed and was stuck at the 2-3 inch mark. I tell her that I'll submit a maintenance report and someone will be able to contact her in the morning to help with that matter.\n\nShe then proceeded to berate me for a solid 15-20 minutes. The key highlights included \"someone is going to break in and steal all of my things\", \"I'm a poor defenseless woman\", and \"You're going to get me RAPED!\"\n\nThe window was STUCK. Stuck as in NOT MOVING. I do not know who was going to fit through the small gap that was there, but I hope that I do not ever meet them as I would be having slenderman nightmares the rest of my life.\n\nFinally, she'd berated me for so long, I knew she wasn't going to stop, so I called the maintenance guy while I had her on hold.\n\nThe maintenance guy answered his cell, and I explain the situation. As soon as I tell him it's stuck and she's afraid that she's going to be raped he starts yelling at me with \"Look, are you a fucking idiot? (and here is where I connected the resident so that we are now on a three way call) I DON'T CARE IF SHE IS FUCKING RAPED. It's a WEEKEND and you SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERING ME WITH THIS SHIT.\"\n\nI heard her say \"Uh, Maintenance Man's Name, I'm on the line you know.\"\n\nThen I heard an \"Oh shit.\"\n\nI hung up and she called back after speaking to him and apologized profusely once she saw WHY I didn't want to call anyone, and said she was going to take it up with their office manager because no one should be talking to anyone that way for being asked to do their job. When questioned I lied and said that I hit the button connecting them on accident (pfft, I was training people on Startel like 2 days after using it, but I was not admitting to that one!) and felt awful. \n\n\nJust thought I'd share so others could bask in my happiest call center moments. &lt;3 ",

But the new managing director of the company has put in a new target of first touch resolution - we have to deal with everything customers ask for on that call. So as of today, we've been told to seek approval for every call transfer we make. If someone wants to discuss their mortgage, which I can't deal with, I have to justify why that person should be transferred. If someone is claiming fraud on their account, (by law, we have to immediately get that person to report the fraud to the fraud department if the customer suspects it), we have to ask as many questions as we can about the fraud to be absolutely sure, then ask if they can be transferred. All this while being targeted on our Average Handling Time and Hold Time. Might just bluntly tell customers tomorrow \"Please hold while I contact a manager to see if I'm allowed to put you in touch with someone who can help\"",

        "text": "I used to work for a vendor call center taking calls for a major entertainment company, answering billing or basic tech support questions.\n\nOne night, I answered a call for a customer, did my greeting, and got the basic idea of what he was calling about. I went to search his account. The assistance software tried to search, but eventually timed out. I ended up getting some weird error code, followed by the non-responding error message. (stab mute button: oh shit oh shit oh shit!)\n\nI tried to log back in, but it wouldn't let me log back in. Then I hear a whole bunch of people around me having the same issue. They were also booted out of the software and unable to sign back in. \n\nA manager shouted, \"The assistance software for this center and the other centers is down. If you are having issues, please explain this to the customers and call them back later when things are up!\"  I explain to the customer the issue that I am having and that I will call him back later when things are running again. He is understanding, but a little irritated, understandably. \n\nI hit the next call button, expecting to have to explain to customers the crap situation we are in and to call back later (which would be awesome for my handle time). However, I hit the button and was amazed, but blessed, to discover silence on the other side. Apparently, the call system also went down. Not only were we unable to log into the assistance software, customers calling in were also unable to get through to an agent. Those that did during this conundrum would just have the call dropped on them. \n\nOf course, that meant there was a whole floor of reps unable to take phone calls. We were told to keep our headsets on in case someone did manage to break through. That meant we were all standing around doing nothing. \n\nI mentioned in a previous submission that my center played music overhead to listen to during the workday. The song Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen came on (and if you don't know this song, pull your head out of the sand. It's a damn classic!) Not all of us, but several of us started to sing along to the lyrics as loud as we could. \n\nPicture it: Bohemian Rhapsody playing, with several reps throughout the entire floor singing along to the lyrics and doing a swaying motion. It was like we were all on some cloud together. \n\nAll good things end though. The song ended, and everyone then just went back to talking amongst their peers. But that was the most memorable 4 minutes of my job.\n\nThe software and call system was down for 90 minutes. This meant 90 minutes of free money, as we had to stay logged in but unable to do anything. \n\nThe guy I had to call back later did get the help he needed. I called him back and assisted him. I even refunded a small item for the inconvenience.\n\nThis was one of my favorite nights at work because of the unexpected bonding experience. If anyone has any stories like this, go ahead and share in the comments. ",

        "text": "I work at a call center company who also has walmart.com as one of their clients. There are a lot of moments where customers need help, and while some situations are easy to solve, other are literally unsolveable, and that's what both angers me and saddens me.\n\nMy last call of the night was from a nice lady who ordered a laptop, a printer, a flash drive, and a laptop bag from us in July of 2015, which was about 8 months ago. She said she only received the printer but that was only because the police officer showed up at her door with the package stating it was stolen. The rest of the items were gone.\n\nThe real issue was that laptop. Computers, TVs, Consoles, and Smartphones are considered high risk items. What this means is, that if a customer called to inform us that they didn't receive any of those items, then we can't issue a replacement or a refund for that order. We have to check the tracking information to see if it was signed or not, and tell the customer to contact the neighbors or any member of the household if they've seen the item and if it's not signed for, we'd have to tell the customer to trace the item, and file a claim with their carrier and file a police report.  She'd then be told to contact his bank or credit card company to dispute the charges.\n\nWhile we couldn't replace or refund her for the laptop, we could easily send a replacement for the rest of the items. Unfortunately, she didn't receive those replacements either.\n\nThe customer was told the steps, and sent Walmart the police report about 3 times. She even then attempted to dispute the charges with her bank, and while she did get the chargeback, months later the chargeback was reversed by the bank because apparently, she didn't dispute the charges in a timely manner. So from then on, it was our problem.\n\nI don't blame the customer, but she was extremely upset. She sounded like she was crying over the phone. During the call, I was very close to crying as well, but at the same time frustrated that the retarded system we have to follow, that's forces this poor woman to jump through 300 hoops, only to not receive her $600 refund.\n\nI looked at her records and found that she called us a LOT regarding the items or the refund she didn't receive. The only thing the agents can do is create an escalation ticket to either the billing department or the manager, which the customer had to wait 7 days each time for a resolution. The customer told me about the amount of escalations she went through up to the time of the call. So I had to talk to one of my supervisors, I told him about the letter she received, and the several times she called and was sent to supervisors and had her issue escalated each time, and he told me to create another escalation ticket to the billing department. I told the customer what I was instructed to do, and she was really upset. She told me to go ahead and escalate the issue to the billing department, but this was the last time she will call, and she threatened to sue Walmart if she didn't get her funds back.\n\nI apologized to her, expressed the genuine empathy I had for her, but felt extremely helpless to do anything else for her. At the same time, I was extremely pissed off at this stupid system this store had to put her through. No one should have to spend months going through what she did. I just finished my ticket after the call and went home.",

L2 made 50 cents more than L1 for 2-3 times the responsibility. Raises were non existent. The only reason I'm making more now than when I started 4 years ago is because my state increased minimum wage.\n\nManagement was less than desirable, and over it was just an undesirable job. \n\nI've finally escaped.

        "text": "  This was from a few years ago, but since I've only now found this subreddit, I'll do my best to remember every detail. The only thing about this story that may be off is there may have been some additional but non important chic chat between myself and the customer (\"how's the weather,\" \"I apologize for my silence while I review,\" things like that), I've left out since I can't remember it.  \n\nTL;DR: Customer has been using possibly stolen credit/debit card info to pay her payments each month. And because of a (I hope still remains fixed) system error loophole, the system continued to not bill for protested/previous balance now due, until she spoke with me. Forgive the formatting, in on my phone.\n\n  I worked a call center for a very large countrywide insurance carrier for about 8 years. I'm licensed, it's mostly inbound, pretty much your typical call center life. I've been doing it long enough that I could pretty much tell by the beginning of the call and the callers tone, how the rest of the call will go. But even more so, I would pick up vibes people give off that make me judge them on a fundamental level and let me decide what type of agent I should be on that call. Like, should I question every thing they say and assume it's bullshit. Do they sound like they're lying, are they on edge, do they sound worked up; I'm sure most of us have this skill. Even one word and its tone can put me on edge and drag me down the \"this is sketchy, must investigate\" spiral. \n\nOne day a lady calls in to pay her bill, but before she even provides me with her policy number, she says that she's going to use her boyfriend's card. I normally have no issues with this, happens a dozen times a day, but it was the way she rushed it/forced it and the tone in those words, I was pretty sure this wouldn't be a stress free call. There was nothing wrong with the words she used, taking 16,000+ calls a year, everyone having a slight variation but generally similar tone, except hers. Every call where someone's lying to you, you kind of pick up that rehearsed line and its tone. That \"I swear I didn't receive the bill\" or the \"the last rep told me...\" you can hear a bull's ass leaking excrement into your ear when these people talk. \nThat rehearsed unnaturalness was very faint, but I thought I it was there, and I was just bored enough to humor myself.\n    C will be customer, M will be me. \n-------\n\n*scripted intro*\n*semi cuts off my intro toward the \"how can I help...cut off\"* \n----/\n\nC: I'm looking to make a payment on my account, but the automated system won't let me. I'm using my boyfriend's card. (Automated system requires her to speak with rep when payments late/behind, so I'm assuming right then that that's why)\n\n\nM: That's not a problem. Before we go any further, is your boyfriend available to speak with?\n\n\nC: Um, why do you ask?\n\n\nM: I just need a quick ok from him to use his card.\n\n\nC: *getting frustrated* Im giving you permission on his behalf, he gave me permission. \n\n\nM: I understand that, but because this isn't your card, company policy is to get permission from the card holder. If he's not there, I'm happy to call him directly. In the meantime what's your policy number, maybe we already have documented permission from him? (When we get permission once, we'll ask if they want us to get permission each time)\n\n*she gives policy number, I thank her while I continue reviewing her account*\n----\n\nM: alright, just reviewing notes. How much are we looking to pay today... *fake surprise tone* Oh, I'm actually not seeing any other names on the file besides yours. *more persistent* Is he there with you? If not I can call him directly for you? I just need to speak with him so I can ask him his name and get his authority to use the card. \n\n\nC: It's \"$2000\" *in surprisingly calm voice* I'm sorry, but listen, this is fucking ridiculous, no one asked me for permission before. Why don't I just give you MY card. It's in my legal name. *gives completely different first and last name* \n\n*suspicion rising, there so many little red flags I'm seeing on this file, from far away it looks like its got super-herpes*\n-----\n\n*brief daydream of what alcohol I'll be drinking after work, brings me back to my happy place* (to be honest thats probably a thought on at least 1 call per day. I remember clearly that this was the call that I thought \"I'm going to need a fucking drink)\n----\n\n\nM:  Thank you. *I'm paging through billing* Is that how your name appears on you license? Im just not seeing we've ever documented a different name before. I just want to make sure your policy matches the name on your license. *using joking tone* You know the DMV, one hiccup with the insurance and they assume you're driving without it. \n*i see account transaction history,  due now $16,000. Min due: (around $2000)  \" And more bullshit with this fucking file, hooray\" I think sarcastically to myself*\n(it was actually something like $16,398.66 or some shit for the due now but I can't remember exact numbers)\n\n\nM: I'm terribly sorry, I need to place you on just a brief hold, there seems to be an issue with my billing software. *puts her on hold*\n\n\n\nSo let me fill you in on what I was seeing prior to putting her on hold.\n**At this point I've reviewed the history of the account and have found that we have documented that we have taken payments from her \"boyfriends\" card but no where have we documented that we've received permission each time \n(we document basic notes for each call i.e. \"CUST CALL, TK PAY W/ BF's CC\" but there was not \"bf gives perm\") . \n**This is an auto and home combined account, and no where on the file is her new name she's giving me present.(Home deed and insurance needs to match legal name, so it would have been on her home policy) \n**Every payment in the last 8 months (new business since then) had been processed, accepted by the system, but then would come back as protested later. Looking at the billing history, some would protest in a few weeks, some were a couple months. The screen was a cluster fuck of payments and protests, cancellation indicators and billing reinstatements. This was the kind of thing that a less ethical rep would see, then put them on hold, drop them back in the queue and go take a shit while it becomes someone else's problem. \n**Here's what was happening which I have never seen before or after that day. Hopefully I can make clear that there's also a massive system error along with questionable payment history in this account. The bill goes out for $2000 (again rounded number can't remember exact) she pays it on the automated phone system, and it goes through. Then at one point in time there began a steady dribble of protested payments coming back, one or more at a time. The very first time it happened, the system did as it should. It accepted that the policy was now behind, and mailed out a cancellation notice. The cancellation notice is always whatever the next normal scheduled bill would have been plus a late fee and service fee. So example, it should have been $2000 plus the fees and then the following bill issued would have been $2000 plus any protested payments to get caught up, so forth and so on. After she satisfied the cancellation notice bill, instead of billing for the $2000 plus protested payments,  it was still only asking for $2000, and no one but me actually noticed for 8 fucking months. \n**My suspicions were originally that she didn't have permission to use THIS card, but now it's so much deeper. Also, I'm pissed at the billing program for being a chocolate infused bag of dicks by helping this customer, since i can also see every cardholder's last name was different. The transcript from banking paperwork was transferred in to the billing system, and the names (can only see last name) of everyone who contested the charges were all fucking different. The last 4 digits (all I can see) were all different as well.]\n\n   \n   So far I've had her on hold for all of about 30 seconds, because for one, I'm saying \"why the fuck has no one managed to see this but me,\" and two I'm also now laughing like a crazed psychopath. (work from home at that point, only the dog can judge me. Ps, he's judgmental as fuck).  \n\n\n*take myself off hold*\n----\n\nM: Thank you so much for holding, I'm terribly sorry for that wait.\n\nC: that's fine.\n\nin the \"most overly friendly, I can't wait to let you know I've saved the day voice\" I can muster\n-----\nM: When I was reviewing your account and getting ready to set up to take the payment, I came across something you need to be made aware of. I'm actually really glad I caught this for you before it got even more out of hand. \n\nC: *worried* Ok? The policy's not cancelled is it? \n\nM: oh no, no it's active, thank goodness, but I think someone's been using you and/or your boyfriend's credit card. *playing dumb, but do the whole give customer benefit of the doubt* It's showing indicators of fraudulent activity, were you aware of that?\n\nC: *sounding even more nervous* No, not at all, I'll have to look into that with him... So can I still make my payment?\n\nM: Actually the minimum I would need to take to bring the account current is $14,000 otherwise the policy won't remain in force (again not true because of the technicality from the candy coated nutsack of a system I'm dealing with... But she doesn't know that) \n\nC: Wait, I don't understand, Ive paid every month. \n\nM: *still playing dumb* Let me make double check I have the right policy in front of me and I haven't made a mistake; you have a *year make and model of vehicle and live at address* \n\nC: Yes\n\nM: Ok, I see you used your boyfriend's card back on *date on payment 5 months ago*, and your boyfriend's Doug Testa (I made up name and used this made up name. Name never appears in our billing system from the protested payments. It's actually a combination of two of my friend's names. This is a Hail Mary pass hoping she doesn't remember the card used 5 months ago. If she says yes, I'm pretty sure I caught her, if she disputes the name, I can use plausible deniably and apologized and say that was the name off the last file I worked on)\n\nC: Yes \n\n*inside I'm screaming \"FUCKING YES.\"\n-----\n\nM: Well Ms.*her legal last name she gave me moments ago*, I'm going to do everything I can to get this resolved for you. *big smile on my face* I've been here a long time. So I know *with slight friendly fake laugh* they trust me around here. I need you to know that every payment on this account had been protested, so between yourself and your boyfriend Dan (kind of say it beneath my breath, let's see if this fucker notices my mistake) there's should be $14,000 collectively in your bank account. Please promise to make sure you check tonight, okay?\n\nC: We will, but what do I do in the meantime.\n\nM: well we still have *i think it was 6 days* until the policy cancels for non pay. Let's make sure your finances are in order so we don't take a payment today and have it come back as non-sufficient funds. If it did, we wouldn't know for 7-10 days and by then your policy would have lapsed. I don't want you do have a lapse 10 days from now and you know even know about it. Murphy's law, your policy would lapse and someone would hit your car, I'd rather you be safe and insured. Makes sense right?\n\nC: *sounding calmer* yes that makes sense, thank you.\n\n*documenting file while speaking to her \"possible fraud activity. DO NOT take any payment for cc/eft unless it's in policy holders name. Or we get verbal approval from the card holder\" and I place my after call status on my phone as outbound*\n----\n\n\nM: Perfect. You don't happen to have your boyfriend Dan's (said it very clear) phone number on you, just in case we need to contact him do you?\n\nC: No, he actually doesn't have a cell, he uses the home phone here. \n\n\nM: Ok, that's fine. Last but not least, I want to make you aware that I have to change the name on the policies to your legal name.(not actually going to do it) It's just so if we were ever audited,  the deed, your license and these policies all match up. So in 7-10 days you'll get new declaration pages and ID cards. \n\n\nC: *scared/worried/irritated* NO don't do that, I didn't authorize that, leave my name how it is. I don't want things changing. \n\n\n*time for the magic words when customer doesn't want you to process a transaction and you want them off your phone*\n-----\n\nM: Actually I'm required to make sure the policy at least matches your license. So just give me just another moment of your time. It's a call center so unfortunately I can ONLY process this while I have you on the phone. \n\nC: *click*\n\n\n  Phone changes to outbound status. I call our underwriter to make them aware and to have them sign off on not taking payments that are not in customer's name. I then call our IT department, make them aware of the issue with the billing system. I document ticket number on file from IT, right under underwriter's comment. \n  I spoke to my manager if I should report this to anyone else, legal maybe. She said that we can't assume the customer is guilty of credit card fraud and to let it go. I didn't talk to my manager further on the subject. \n\n  I get an email that my ticket had been resolved. I sign into the policy and lo and behold, we billed for her $14,000 and the policy cancelled (obviously) for non pay. Not for lack of trying to pay but every rep couldn't overturn my rule for how payment needed to be taken since both myself and level two underwriter signed off. \n\n",

        "text": "I just recently started reading posts on this forum and I just want to first say how much of a relief it has been reading stories so similar to mine. I keep reminding myself that it's a job and someone's gotta do it, but I wonder why things must be so difficult in call centers.\n\nAnyway, tomorrow is my last day at my current company. Next Monday I will be starting a new job - still phone work, but a much smaller unit, so not so much a \"call center\" as my soon-to-be previous job. The place I work right now is a company that administers claims for travel insurance. I work in customer service. As of this month, I have been there for six years. Six years of my life spent working for a company that couldn't care less about how their crappy management continually promoting only the \"favorites\" of the office and making one bad decision after another is systematically tearing their company apart.\n\nI trained new hires for a period of time. I was hired at a time when we had an actual training program, but once a certain person got promoted to the head of the claims department, they did away with official training and started having new hires sit with fellow employees to learn by osmosis or whatever. They would hire people with hardly any computer skills and then wonder why they weren't ready to be released on the phones within a week's time.  They would also continually pile work on me and expect me to train person after person how to handle calls and do this work at the same time, but we have ALWAYS been \"behind\" on claims, so we always get back to back calls all day, every day, from the moment you log in until the very end of the day, neverending calls of people who are angry because their claim was denied or upset because something terrible happened on their trip. So while training people how to handle calls, how to do the desk work, and explain the entire business to a person who has never heard of travel insurance, I was expected to stay live on the phone. How can I train someone, complete \"off the phone work\", and takes nonstop calls all at the same time? Eventually I got written up for having \"too much off the phone time\" and I told them I no longer wanted to train people. It was all downhill from there for me. It didn't help that I was bored all day - didn't matter how much work I had, I was so bored I came home depressed every day.\n\nI feel such relief knowing that tomorrow is my last day. Too many times have I had to sit by while people who clearly were the suck-ups got away with doing nothing all day and while genuinely good people were trampled all over for not picking up their slack. I know in a way I might be moving from one bad situation to another, but I feel good about it - at least it won't be working with insurance claims. Awful, awful stuff.\n\nI'm sure I could go on for a while longer, but those few things I just wanted to get off my chest. Thank you for listening. :)",

I have been getting more of these lately and I realized it could be a tactic to save on long distance fees. Or it could also be the job is listed as call center incoming only (no \"cold calling\").  Are any of you at Call Centers aware of this as a practice at your jobs?\n\nAlso anybody work at places that spoof the caller's own home number?  What's up with that?",

        "text": "Hey there! I'd like to preface this with a small note that I've had too little sleep, and way too much coffee, so we can chalk up any readability issues to that. So, I've been working for a fairly large call center for a bit over a year now, and I've noticed that over time I have become a bit (read - very) pigheaded in the way I do/react to things.\n\nI remember that when I started working for the company, I took into account all advice my manager and more experienced CSR's provided. Why? Because they knew more than I did, and it was useful. \n\nNow, I don't really view things like that.\n\nI'm a jaded veteran that has already worked in a couple of projects, and I can say with confidence - I know my stuff, and I'm the guy you can turn to when you have an issue. The problem? That sort of viewing is kind of hindering my ability to receive feedback and successfully implement it. Yes, I know my procedures inside-side out, forwards and backwards, I know how to calm dawn a rabid customer and make them happy. I also know that I'm far from perfect.\n\nI'd love to get someone's point of view on the issue, as I feel like my own is not enough. The next paragraph will show how *I* view things, maybe someone can point out my flaws for me.\n\nI don't know why, but half the feedback that my manager provides feels like it's literally contradicting itself. For example - he wants my procedures (and thoroughness when working) to remain the same, while decreasing my AHT. To me, that sounds like these two are are polar opposites, and you can only have one or the other. When asked how to achieve such a task, all I get are suggestions that would decrease my effectiveness in other areas.\nThe other half of the feedback I get just feels like nagging without anything constructive.\n\nI know my manager tries hard with me, but it's really frustrating when what they're asking you to do goes against your work methodology and the way you view things.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue, and maybe some tips.\n\nThank you!",
