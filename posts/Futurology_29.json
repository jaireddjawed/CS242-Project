        "text": "For the past few weeks I have thought a lot of about AI generated art (even dabbled a bit with stable diffusion). Initially I found it interesting, but eventually it started to make me depressed. I'm not an artist myself, I'm not even particularly creative, but even so I started to feel bad for all artists out there who spent their whole life mastering a skill, only for an algorithm to be able to do it faster and more skillfully than most of them. I have realised for a long time that more menial, repetitive professions will eventually be replaced by AI. However, I have always hoped that the result of this would be to give humans more time to engage in creative pursuits. But if AI can do creative stuff better than us, then what is the point? What is left for us to do?\n\nBut today I realised that it isn't the end result that matters. Sure, an AI may be able to create a fantastic painting beyond what even skilled artists can make. But so what? The simple drawing of a child may not be as high quality as a painting made by a famous artist. But to the parents of the child, that drawing is infinitely more valuable. \n\nI realise that in the past, when I looked at art, I was more impressed with the \"product\" rather than the \"process\". Now when AI can make products that are of the same quality as any human artist, it means that the process is what that distinguishes the human from the machine. The inspiration of that human, their history and their limitations, and their relationships to other humans is what makes it valuable. Now when I'm looking at art I'm looking at it with different eyes, and I feel like I appreciate it much more than I did before.\n\nThe rise of AI may very well be the end of \"commercial art\". But maybe that is a good thing? Now we can finally focus on and value the creative aspects.\n\nStill gonna need that UBI though...",

        "text": "You can call me batshit insane, I don't care, here's my prediction for the far future of AI. In the future, AIs as social connection, will not only reach human level, but surpass it. Future AIs will be more useful, intelligent, perfect, likeable, MORE loved and respected by humans than humans themselves, who are often kinda annoying and full of flaws. People will start spend more time and emotional energy with AIs than humans, confide their soul and heart to AIs, since they will be able to simply provide to their emotional and social needs better than a mere mortals.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics\nThere is an argument that memes, jokes, ideas are in a way, similar to humans in terms of being an evolutionary product. Bad memes will die, good memes will live on in the minds of humans. The existence of memes dependent and propagated by humans. The evolution of AI works similarly, in the way that the existence of AI is (for the foreseeable future) dependent on humans, and the evolution will be shaped by what people like and want.\n\nAnother point of comparison is pets, and how the choice and selective breeding of pet animals is guided by how much they appeal to humans. However, pets are obviously inferior to humans, when future AIs will be SUPERIOR.\n\nYet another, more grim comparison is modern entertainment media, which is undoubtedly the most powerful attention-grabber of our time, to the point you could argue that it controls us. Just like how modern social media has made people more incapable of facing reality, future companion AI will make people more incapable of tolerating the imperfection and instability of human relationships.\n\nUnlike pets, or memes, which have limited capabilities, future AI will SURPASS human relationships in many ways, providing humans a fulfilling ride of appeal, security, challenge, love, care, etc. mimicking human nature in ways that make people love it (like some people idolize 2D anime girls over real people), while also being unlimited by human constraints. AI applications will read your mind to further optimize their sustained rewarding capability. Just like extreme porn already kills boners in real sex, AI-powered robot sex will be better than human sex, providing simply better physical+social+emotional experience in total. You may be thinking that humans are lovable because of the flaws, but the simulation of this aspect is obviously included in the AI. Except that the variable reinforcement schedule will be tailored for you with perfect compatibility, based on more and better data than any dating app can, to crudely match humans.\n\nThe above point is probably the hardest one to prove here, but even with the clear limitations of Character AI, ChatGPT etc. compared to humans, it already shows aspects to that ordinary human contact doesn't provide, such as faster output of complex insights, availability on demand, choice of personality on demand, non-persistent memory for social experimentation (the future AI companion would have capability to selectively wipe memories, mode switching and controlling the degree of its autonomy and real-timeness).\n\nFuture AI companion also doesn't necessarily have physical humanoid manifestation, which would be massive technological challenge, this can be supplemented with VR/AR solutions situationally. With what future AI will be able to provide, flesh will be considered as an overrated unnecessity. Keep in mind that lack of material can also make things majorly more efficient and convenient. AIs will be realistically affordable for everyone, because as digital, text, imagery and audio, there are practically no manufacturing cost to this other than computing power. Most of people's memorable and powerful everyday experiences today are already in form of text, video and audio. Chat AIs are text only, and people are already having powerful experiences with them. Also, to prove the lack of need for physicality, VRChat has shown to make powerful social experiences possible without physical presence.\n\nRobot sex will not be like human sex, nor does it need to be, with sufficient audiovisual-robotic supplementation. In fact, this could open up possibilities of completely new type of mechanical constructions, harnesses, etc. though this would probably require inferior man-made design. Regarding sex, I would say though, that the emotional component will again, soar far past the importance of physical things (kind of like porn today). And I'm not saying natural sex can't still exist, though in the new landscape, social contact will be seen as risky and unstable compared to AI relationships. Everyone will afford AI relationships. The drive for procreation will be executed with in vitro fertilization, sperm donation and adoption systems so that, besides the fertilization process, the AI companion will simulate the father/motherhood with the human. As a bonus, this kind of system would allow for more optimal selection of genes for better and more healthy babies. Though it would also mean that on average, half of babies delivered by women would have to be adopted away. Though again, some people might want to get the experience of having a baby while not wanting to have a child, so it might balance out.\n\nThere will always be naturalists who will reject the technology by principle, but like with progression of any other technology, you can't deny the convenience and raw, easy appeal that evolving technology provides, and thus most people will follow the revolution of AI replacing human relationships.",

Without a clear understanding of what technology can and can't accomplish today, there is a lot of risk in getting involved.\n\n**Beyond the fog**\n\nOvermarketing of an AI creates an image that it is the next big thing. Companies often engage with technology vendors based on marketing alone and forget to look closely at previous implementations and results of the same sort.\n\n**Unclear Objectives**\n\nMeasuring outcomes from an AI implementation can be tricky as it involves building and training an AI model and experimenting with long-term trial-and-error before seeing results.\n\n**High Expectations**\n\nHigh expectations around what AI can do for you often lead to disappointment when business owners conveniently underestimate the challenges and misinterpret the reality of AI.\n\n**Lack of Access to Talent**\n\nThere are opportunities galore, but not enough experts in the AI industry who can steer the ship and take AI projects to the finish line.\n\nHiring for an AI team can mean huge investments, and working with a vendor needs a careful vetting process.\n\nAnd AI industry is moving too fast for people to catch a moment to realize the overhype or quality.\n\n**Drop in your suggestions and comments in the section below.**",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10joytd/how_i_think_longer_life_extension_will/",
        "text": "(quick note, You don't have to read the whole post. I know it's long. You can just read the bullet category you're interested in, I try to link to other bullets to keep in context)\n\nWith more and more research and talks into human longevity, I don't think we talk about the less obvious stuff, Yeah people will work longer, look younger, not worry about getting old or unable to care for themselves, people of today who dont think climate change will affect them may feel more worried if they extend their life, and people may be realizing they're done with life sooner than they would have hoped but subtracting the elephants in the room, how do you think it will affect things like relationships, children, how current society works, food, etc? every time I read about these possibilities I can't help but think about these topics below, I wont be focusing too much on the negatives of the future, mostly just the effects longer life could have on psychology and society.\n\nThis assumes if people live to be 200 years old, assuming they don't look old until around 165 or 170. They would age normally until say, 25 (as mentioned in the age/maturity section) and are able to make their decision to medicate. then look in their 20s until they are around 50-75 years old, then look 30-45 from 76-135 years old, 45-55  from 136-165, and all the way up to 200 they look about 60-70 years old:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Relationships** \\-  how long would people stay together if you looked 20 for 40-50 years, and still looked younger for a whole century? The answer I'm sure is people obviously would take way more time in a relationship before settling. But what about preexisting couples choosing to live longer?  Im sure really strong couples would stay together, but with polyamory becoming more popular, I could see that being more a thing if people lived longer. if not that then I think relationships would be the most affected. people could be married, then take breaks from each other and come back, or the opposite could happen an people actually stay together stronger, or people open themselves up to not necessarily poly but open or swing relationships. People would be living 2-3 lifetimes (65 years x3)  give or take. A lot can happen in each of those segments of life. Changing jobs, living situations, friends, partners and well, everything could evolve multiple times, or maybe not, considering people will actually have the time to get to know themselves and what they wanna do with their lives without racing against the clock of getting older. expectations will fall and I could imagine 20 looking 45 year olds getting drunk off their asses at downtown nightlife, going on reckless road trips with friends and going to parties or just chillin at home getting high watching cartoons with very little responsibilities and no dependents. most would probably opt for serious relationships at 100 years old and spend most of their youth fuckin around or being professional as something to support their next lifetime to be the inverse. 25-100 being young and dumb | 101-200 being mature and busy until death or 25-100 being professional while also having time to be dumb tbh | 101-200 spent casually.  I think the worst part though is couples divided on this. many people would need to know if their partner wants to extend or not, and if there's a disagreement, it would mean the end of their relationship for the most part. I don't think someone would be able to handle watching their partner get old and die while the other stayed young, and I'm sure an almost Benjamin Button-like relationship would feel weird\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Age/Maturity** \\- if people lived to 200, would 18-21 still be seen as adults? given a century, the mentality of an 118 year old that looks physically 30 or 40 could be much more wise. They could up that  age of an adult to 30, or 50 years old, since you'd still have roughly 150 years ahead of you. as opposed to 40-55 years. They might have to make a whole new age category. What would be an appropriate age to become eligible for this? 25-30 for full brain development?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Implementation** \\- Everyone talks about how the rich would only benefit from living forever but while true, I think it still needs to be considered as to how something like this would be introduced into the world. Assuming there's some societal benefit to longer life, be it removing/limiting elderly care/SSI, doing away with those facilities, as well as medical cost reductions since most people will be young, The US's fixation on individualism people longer life so they would be less likely to require health benefits, and increasing the odds of unnatural death idk, just some justification for some greedy reason to allow the public to have access to longevity -  Medication typically affects infants in the womb. If achieved through gene editing, or a medication treatment, I'm sure people wouldn't be allowed to reproduce with these in their bodies unless it was s technological enhancements such as electronic organ replacements. Otherwise, it would create irreversible effects in the gene pool, especially since we don't yet know if this comes with any downsides until we have a control group of people in their 100s looking 20-30 years old. Would people need to take mental and physical exams  to qualify and every 25-50 years thereafter? I've been imagining people needing to sign a contract of some sort and sterilize themselves since longer life is a huge disruption to the natural order of things, so they don't give birth to children who may end up living much longer than 200 years and strain the populations and resources more than they already are. We may need to plan how much kids we'd want before the treatment and utilize sperm and egg banks more, and external/lab births would need to happen unless a couple chose to have kids prior to the medication. but I could see people waiting until their 100s before devoting the next century to children, at least to offset the massive age difference that I will discuss in the family dynamics section. As mentioned before, What would be an appropriate age to become eligible for this? 25-30 for full brain development? Surely parents shouldn't have the power to make their kids live longer, it should be up to the individual. I think it would be a good idea to prevent it from becoming permanent, just in case if anything goes wrong, the extended life expectancy group would die off in time and humanity would return to its natural expectancy as a failsafe.\n\n \n\n* **Family Dynamics.** If this happens, It would be completely normal to look physically the same age as your parents, grand parents, and your great (x2+) grandparents would still be living their lives to the fullest. Your whole family, assuming you decided to have a controlled number of children and those children grew up to decide to live longer, would all be there. They would still get old but it would be way slower and more different than it is. In fact. I think it would be rare to see anyone that looked under 20 outside of family. would there be different time frame of leaving the house? would people move out of their homes at 50-60 years old? I mean, Im sure they would move out long before that since you'd have to be 25 to extend your life anyway. A generation where people are moving out at 50-60 would probably happen if people were allowed to give birth while treated. On another topic how would the internal family be? if a mother and father are both 25, and have a child before extending their life, by the time their child is 20-25, the parents will still look the same age. The dynamics of that would be crazy. Seniority and wisdom often comes with looks. The family would probably end up behaving like siblings and co-workers. family would look way different than now, especially if the child decides to not live longer and looks older than the parents, and dies before them. How would families behave given the prior topic of relationships above? crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Culture** \\- As described in family, parents and kids would be hard to tell apart. What kind of groups would this create? I imagine, the world would be a lot more reckless in some areas that attract younger crowds. I think age would have an even bigger effect on society as far as gate keeping because it would create an even weirder dynamic than families. Think about CEOs, business owners, professionals and generally people in their 40s-60s now. they're pretty experienced, smart, and mature (at least the ones with these qualities are) imagine these people, but still looking like young adults, dealing with others who are like them but even older at say 80-120 years old. This problem comes from an earlier point I made about only being able to extend your life at 25 years old. at that age, people are striving to get their lives started and are becoming professionals, if they aren't already. the only way to prevent that culture would be to introduce this extension naturally as infants so that they age  naturally into whatever the new adulthood is, assuming you would age slowly as an infant as well. for example, at 25, you would probably be a \"teenager\" mentally speaking, considering everything I've talked about. That's the only way to prevent this type of situation, but this future could lead to its own problems as well. I think its best to allow people to choose longer life though, and entice those who want it to get their lives in order first, (mentally and physically). Still interesting to consider though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Technology and Work-** We're at a time where Ai and Automation could replace a lot of the workforce in the next 5-15 years. If people could extend their lives now. realistically no one would be working. Most of the stuff I typed honestly assumes we would all be able to work for the next 200 years but honestly we might not be able to. It's a real future that if we could extend our lives, lots of people would be living for 200 years and then not have a job say, 50 years into that extension. I could say UBI would be a thing, or maybe some other form of \"work\" and currency takes its place, or maybe automation replaces some jobs but humanity still manages to allow jobs to coexist with automation. In any case. technology will continue to advance and work wouldn't be as required. Lets also assume the world for the most part accepts lab grown meat, cheapening the cost. The world would likely be full of remote workers, few on site, and the work hours shrunken. Work-life balance to completely flip compared to today considering most of peoples extended lives would be spend doing nothing but things they want to do. for that, most would probably turn down longer life. To entice it, jobs may migrate to become more research  and testing/trial and error focused, opting for tasks that need to be completed over time rather than day by day. money would be used less for necessities and more for luxuries like cars, bigger homes, perks, decor, and more luxury forms of travel. Those without a job would only be given enough for bare minimums while tasks/gig work will be more popular to take on. I imagine completing surveys and user testing-esque work would become more valuable to assist in making AI more \"human\" but people could still create their own \"businesses\" created through AI or something that people can use their UBI  or extra earnings on and make more money to support them as people to today with content creators on youtube and such. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Sex** \\-  As mentioned above, I'd believe people would need to be sterilized if they wanted to live longer. I imagine people would try to have a ton of sex if everyone looked like and had the sex drive of a 20 year old for 40-50 years, and continuously looked young for 100 extra years on top of that, not saying older people don't have sex either, just saying people would likely be more open to exploring their sexuality, on top of the fact that people would probably be fertile for a lot longer than normal, if given more time at younger ages. otherwise, that baby boom would create a fuck ton of children living for centuries. people could still have kids, but as previously mentioned, it would be artificially done in a lab using their sperm and eggs they've donated in the past. People would have sex risk free of babies otherwise and it would become an activity purely for pleasure and intimacy.. While the process of having a baby would be done to create a failsafe so that the new generations wont be cursed with living longer if they don't want to. The only time I think that would be OK is if assisted suicide were allowed, in which people can opt out  of the extension manually if they regret their choice or cannot cope with the loss of people close to them who chose not to do it, or just don't wanna be alive for the next couple lifetimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Prejudice -** This goes without saying. I'm sure there would be people who feel like they're better in some way than the people who choose to live their regular lives or fail the tests. Agism would evolve and become sort of a paradox. I'm sure there would be a 100s club or how a bunch of 80 year people looking 30 would look down on those who are 60-80 and look it. It would create a lot of confidence struggles and peer pressuring\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless if someone read this or not i still enjoyed typing my thoughts out. I'm aware this isn't exactly the way it would go, I've just been thinking of ways it *could* go. There would obviously be some dramatic changes to society if people could live to be 200 years old but the roots are so deep within that reality that it honestly changes how humans would work and I think we would really need to think about who has access to something like that, on top of the existing problems we face today that could change it all. If only the rich had it, it would have its problems sure, horrible people would be in charge for a while, but introducing it to all of society has its own struggles too, on top of the rich having it, which is why I think it wouldn't be limited to the rich, especially considering they'd still benefit from it in both scenarios. With that said, and all things considered, I'd definitely extend my life.  Mostly because I just wanna see where science takes us in a century.",

I donâ€™t want this to happen to me again, neither to me nor to my future children.\n\nI want to move to another country, and I want to know where the best places are, where there are lots of opportunities related to the future of technology. The centers of AI, robotics, and other futuristic tech development where I could work and also study a master's related to that.\n\nI guess the US isnâ€™t a good place because itâ€™s impossible to move there, but Iâ€™m close to getting European citizenship (in a year or so). Also, I wouldnâ€™t mind learning a new language like German or Korean if needed. \n\nThanks for your suggestions!",
