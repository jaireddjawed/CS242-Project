        "author": "FakePersona011",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/9ewxqo/flipflops_leveltriggered_vs_edgetriggered/",
        "text": "In a book I'm currently reading,which happens to be written by my professor, he says that latches can be combined to create a flip-flop in two ways that differ in triggering methods:\n\n1. Flip-flops  whose input is valid at c=1(or 0) and whose state is changed at c=0(1)  (He uses Master-Slave or level-triggered interchangeably for those)\n2. Flip-flops that are triggered only at a level transition (He calls those edge-triggered)\n\nI did some research outside of that book and I found materials that state that **only latches are level-triggered and flip-flops are edge-triggered by definition.** \n\nWhy is there so much confusion of terminology? Even people in this sub can't seem to agree on what's a latch and what a flip-flop.\n\nMy professor equates master-slave flip-flops with level-triggered flip-flops.\n\nThe problem with that is that all master-slave flip-flops seem to me to be edge-triggered in practice. Because for example,  even though the input  changes continuously while c=1, the output is disabled. Then c becomes 0  and the input stops affecting what's stored in the master at that  point(an edge 1-&gt;0) and now the slave starts changing its output to  match the master and even if it happens continuously while c=0, the  input remains as it was when the edge occurred, so the output still  remains the same until the input gets the chance to change the state of  the master and c=0 again which means until an edge (1-&gt;0) is seen  again.\n\nThe question here is: Is that correct?\n\nThe  other issue is that the example he gives of an edge-triggered flip-flop  is actually a master-slave D flip-flop,but then he goes to compare it  to \"*the* master-slave flip-flop\" by  which he means one that uses SR latches as opposed to D because apparently- using a D latch instead of SR is what makes it  edge-triggered.\n\nThe question here is: Does it? If so,why?",

I haven't tested it out yet but I ordered an accelerometer so I am waiting for it be delivered so I can then read values off it.\n\nIn addition to drivers, RTOS seems to be becoming more and more popular nowadays (looked at a bunch of jobs) but not having experience in it kind of kills my chances of applying to those positions. How important is it to know the basic OS principles i.e mutex, deadlock?\n\nIf you were to advise someone who's trying to break into this field, what would it be?

So, I want to check whether a candidate transistor I found would actually fit the application.  This would be for a quadcopter, operating voltage 12-24V or so, maybe 60A bursts of current to motors with more like 20-30A typical usage. Control would be a 3 phase trapezoidal waveform with an absolute ceiling of around 70KHz (realistically probably half of that at full throttle, but again, building plenty of margin in).\n\nOne FET I'm eyeing is the [Infineon BSC094N06LS5ATMA1](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/726-BSC094N06LS5ATMA).  It looks pretty good on switching times, plenty of headroom for current and voltage, and very good resistance and capacitance.  \n\nIf I've considered those stats though, am I missing anything?

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a power systems engineer, so naturally I encounter active and reactive power a lot. I know what reactive power is, and how to work with it in calculations... but I've never seen a convincing explanation of *why* we need it. Why we can't just have the current and voltage perfectly in-phase everywhere. The most common explanations online or in textbooks have always sounded frustratingly vague to me.\n\nSo I started thinking about it for myself and came up with the following line of reasoning:\n\n1. If there is no instantaneous voltage drop across a branch, no current will flow.\n2. Hence, voltages at different ends of the branch need to be slightly out of phase with each other, to ensure a voltage drop across the branch. (This is reflected in the well-known equation linking active power transmission to voltage angle difference.)\n3. Currents throughout the system need to be perfectly in phase with each other; otherwise, you run into trouble with Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n4. If the voltages at two ends of a branch need to have a phase difference, and the currents at both ends cannot have a phase difference, it follows that on at least one end of the branch, the current must be out of phase with the voltage.\n\nIs this correct? I'm particularly iffy about step 3, it seems like quite a bold claim... Any input would be much appreciated!",

Sadly I don't have an internship under my belt and my knowledge of embedded systems is limited to a course I took working with PICs (16 and 32) but it was the most interesting course to me. While the course was a pretty good start, I'm still rough around the edges with interrupts and timers and things like that. \n\nSince I don't have internship experience I decided my best course of action was working on some personal projects to hone my skills and have something to show to recruiters. After a few suggestions I read online, I found the book \"Make: AVR Programming\" and it seems pretty helpful. I ordered the AVR suggested by the book (ATMega168) so I can work along with the exercises and understand the chip better then move on to a project of my own. I'm hoping this is a good course of action, though I'm open to suggestions.\n\nMy question is how relevant are AVRs in the industry? Are they regarded in the same way that Arduinos are (which I learned are a big no-no if I do plan to make a career out of embedded systems)? And how do they compare to PICs?  \n\nI'm going to keep working with the book because it seems pretty useful but would you suggest I do something else on top of learning from the book? \n\nThank you!",

But for the purposes of determining max switching frequency could I use Qg @4.5v or @Vth?\n\nBasically the way I understand MOSFETs is you charge and discharge the gate to turn it on or off, and the higher voltage allows more charge onto the gate (acts like a capacitor) which lowers Rds(on), but the gate is still 'open' at the lower charge/voltage so I should be able to switch it faster?\n\nIs there something wrong in my understanding? Also, any tips on how to determine the maximum efficient switching frequency for a given mosfet (used as a motor driver)?\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: also what does the Qgs and Qgd numbers signify? what do you use them for?",

The work is not particularly difficult, and the environment is pretty low-stress. Overall, it's a stable, comfortable career.\n\nAnd yet I don't want to keep doing this forever. Honestly, this job doesn't capture my passion and desire, and it's not especially challenging or stimulating. I'd rather be doing something more cutting-edge and research-ish. I feel like I cheated myself out of a childhood dream, and I'm feeling frustrated and stuck.\n\nAnd I guess there's where I'm at a loss. I'm not quite sure what my options are.\n\nI earned my non-thesis Master's degree in electrical engineering prior to my job. I never really got into undergraduate- or graduate-level research because I didn't really know what opportunities to look for, or what interested me. And so even if I wanted to apply to Ph.D programs (not that I necessarily do at the moment), I wouldn't have the history of research experience or publications to be a strong candidate.\n\nWhat other options are there? I know that national labs have open positions for Bachelor's- and Master's-level applicants. But I was told that if I did that, I would be seen as a lowly support staffer who would only ever do grunt work, and so such a career switch would lead to a dead end. I'm skeptical of that, but I don't know enough to make a good judgement call.\n\nOn a similar note, do university labs have openings like that for outside applicants?\n\nResearch internships are really only meant for university students, right? Is there nothing like that for someone a few years into his post-collegiate career?\n\nAnd what else can I do on my own? I can certainly work on personal projects, writing software and implementing circuits on development kits and doing VLSI layouts and the like. I can also read my old textbooks to re-learn material from college that I forgot. Besides that, what can I do to be more current, and stay abreast of industrial and research developments? Are there any recommended sources for research publications?\n\nAnd finally, besides just doing new stuff and tinkering, and reading everything I can read, is there anything else I can do to figure out what else I might want to do with my life?\n\nAny help, suggestions, and general advice would be greatly appreciated. Or, maybe I'm just being an idiot and I should be told not to complain about the good things in my life.",

I'm a CE major and am taking a digital systems design class this semester.\n\nWe are supposed to submit an idea for an ASIC, which we will then implement if it's accepted.\n\nI'm having trouble coming up with ideas of what to do (not much of an ideas guy unfortunately, I do better on the implementation side of things) and would like to get some suggestions from you!\n\nThe teacher has suggested: neural networks, math functions of medium complexity, SoC and NoC, image/video processing algorithms.\n\nI, initially, was going to propose an ASIC for primality testing (and prime generation), something that could be used to accelerate RSA encryption, but, after running some key gen tests on my computer and seeing how fast it can generate 4096 bit RSA keys, I gave up on the idea.\n\nCurrently I am thinking about implementing an octuple-precision floating point ALU, but I would love to know of any interesting ideas for something like this.\n\nMuch thanks :)",

I wanted to look into controllers that are realized for race cars/ superbikes or even automated drones and such. I have taken classic linear controls and now I am starting to read into digital controls. Does anyone have experience with this? I am interested in finding some literature so I can apply it to my research and even projects of my robotics club.\n\n",

        "text": "Hi everyone! \n\nSo I'm currently taking a class that requires me to find the Magnitude of a Frequency Response, and I was wondering if any of you know how I should go about finding |H(w)|. I originally thought that you should multiply the frequency response by the complex conjugate, separate into real and imaginary, and then add their squares and square root that, but that seems to give me a different answer or at least a very complicated looking one - is there a better way for me to do this?\n\nI'm just very confused and I'm not even sure if I know what I'm doing anymore. As an example, could anyone possibly break down for me how to find |H(w)| if H(w) =  1/(1+jwRC). I know the answer is 1/sqrt((wRC)\\^2 + 1), I'm just not sure of the process I should take to get to that answer.\n\nThanks!",
