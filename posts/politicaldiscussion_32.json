        "text": "One of the more understated but very interesting phenomena in the last few years is the trajectory of one Ron Johnson, the Republican Senator from Wisconsin. Johnson has won three elections in a row with a slim &gt;50% majority, despite being in a lean-blue state.\n\n- He won an impressive victory in 2010 against Russ Feingold, who was a deeply entrenched Democratic incumbent representing the state since 1992. It was a close election (52% to 47%) but a clear victory nonetheless.\n\n- In 2016 he won again against Russ Feingold, 50.2% to 46.7%.\n\n- And finally this week he won against Mandela Barnes, 50.5% to 49.5%.\n\nEach is a relatively close win, and yet each time Johnson emerges the winner. This is despite him being a strong conservative in a lean-blue state. Wisconsin has a Democratic governor and its other Senator is an extremely progressive Democrat (Tammy Baldwin) who advocates for Medicare 4 All, gun control, and LGBT+ rights. Johnson, in the meantime, goes to the right on nearly every issue: he has refused to take the COVID vaccine, does not believe in climate change, refused to codify gay marriage into federal law, is anti-marijuana, has suggested that any *Roe v Wade* supporters in Wisconsin should move to another state, and believes that Trump was the actual winner of the 2020 election but it was stolen from him. Yet, he continues to win reelection.\n\nHow does he do it? What about his strategy is more effective than that of his other Republican counterparts who have lost competitive elections? Is Johnson an effective model for other swing state Republicans to follow?",

DeSantis won Florida by 20 points, and he even won in blue areas like Miami-Dade, in double digits (13%). \n\nHis win catapulted him to the front of the list of the 2024 presidential candidates. \n\nDonald Trump had already started attacking him, as soon as he completed his Florida gubernatorial race. It looks clear that Trump sees DeSantis as perhaps his only real challenger for his presidential run. \n\nDo you think DeSantis can take on Trump? As much as a rising star as DeSantis is, it wouldn’t be the first Florida governor Trump takes down. Before Trump won in 2016, Florida governor Bush was who everyone thought would win in 2016. Before Trump beat him. Part of the reason Bush lost was that he had the personality of a wet napkin. Everyone will forever remember his “please clap” humiliating plea to the crowd. \n\nCan DeSantis beat Trump or will he just be Bush, another wet blanket?",

Even good presidents are hit with 40+ House seat losses. \n\nOn top of that, inflation is at a 40 year high. One of the most famous political tropes is “it’s the economy stupid”. Even if this wasn’t a midterm election cycle, inflation where everyone in the country experienced life getting more expensive should have been enough to destroy the party in power. \n\nWhat makes President Biden almost immune to not just bad news but the historical patterns of midterms? Where most presidents take a shellacking, Biden has held off a red wave, and could possibly even keep both houses of congress. \n\nHow did Joe Biden manage to hold off on projected defeat, that everyone (even Democrats) were expecting in the midterms?",

        "text": "With the majority margin ever-shrinking in the House, and with multiple reports of McCarthy struggling to shore up enough support to be Speaker, and Pelosi mulling retirement, it begs the question of who else could take the reigns.\n\nBut let's think outside the box (or House in the case) and discuss who could fill the job. As you know, there is absolutely no requirement that the Speaker be a sitting member of Congress. \n\nSo, imagine a scenario wherein, hypothetically, the GOP garners a &lt;5 seat majority, and the most vocally, extreme members refuse to back Kevin McCarthy for Speaker. Much like the UK in seeking to build a sort of Parliamentary Coalition, the Democrats were to say that all 200+ of them would back \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, an outsider, to be the new Speaker if 5-10 GOP would join them. \n\nWho could be put forward? Why? Would any in the opposing part sign on? What would be the ramifications? The pros/cons of their leadership?",
