        "text": "Hi all. 2L here. \n\nIn my undergrad, I participated in a program that got me into law school a year early. I skipped senior year and went straight to law school. I turned 21 my first week of classes.\n\nThis to say that I still have my undergrad thesis hanging over my head. I technically don't graduate until I have written/defended my thesis (which also doubles as my law school's writing requirement, because of the program I'm in). So as long as I finish my thesis during law school and defend it, then I get my undergraduate degree and can fully get my law degree. \n\nI didn't get a job last summer because I started applying too late and I used the summer to work on/research for my thesis. I enjoyed it and it was nice to have a good chunk of non-school time to devote to it. However, now as a 2L, I am still without a job at the moment. I applied to a few jobs, interviewed for one and haven't heard back (I sent a follow up email but I probably didn't get it). \n\nI'm starting to worry that I didn't get a job this summer because I didn't have one last summer since I was working on my thesis. I also am wondering if I even want a job this summer because I still haven't finished it and this will probably be the summer I spend writing/rewriting a ton. \n\nI guess I'm just curious about people's thoughts in terms of summer jobs and how necessary they are/how much they boost your resume. I also should mention I am not apart of any law school organizations as I am on my school's Improv Team and between that and school, I don't really have time for anything else without completely screwing myself mentally/socially. I'm also leaving Improv after this year because the school-load is too much, and I'm not planning on joining anything new so I can just focus my last year and pass the bar. \n\nShould I include two summers of thesis work on my resume for employers to see that I wasn't just wasting my summer? I don't want them to think I'm not serious about law school/the legal profession just because I didn't join any school clubs and didn't get a summer job so I could work on my thesis, but I also really value these possible last two free summers to work on this thesis and my free time outside of school/school related activities like clubs and such. \n\nTLDR: I didn't have a job summer after 1L and I probably won't get one this year, which I am personally fine with so I can work on my thesis but I don't want my resume to look like I don't take school seriously. I do. I just don't want to join five clubs while also trying to pass my classes and have enough time for myself. Is this going to completely screw me over once I'm done with school and looking for a job against all the other law students who were part of clubs/had two jobs during school?",

Later they ask, ‚Äòhave I been unclear about anything?‚Äô‚Äù Then the presenter asked why the Lawyer might have said this. \n\nAt first, the answers were what I would consider to be very reasonable. Maybe they‚Äôre just trying to make sure they explain themself well. Maybe they‚Äôre talking about a complex legal issue. Maybe the client looked confused. Maybe there‚Äôs a language barrier. \n\nBut the presenter didn‚Äôt seem content with this, and then asked again why a person would feel the need to say this. So a different type of answers was offered: the lawyer is egotistical; they think the client is uneducated/dumb (possibly Bc they are an immigrant); the lawyer is inconsiderate or condescending. \n\nThe presenter definitely liked those answers more. \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I know bias (both conscious and unconscious) is a real and powerful force. But this hypothetical seems like a stretch to me, but I certainly would be wrong. Any outside opinions would be great. \n\nBtw, I copied the hypo verbatim from the screen and the answers from the chat, so that is all a faithful representation.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I need some advice. \n\nMy boyfriend and I broke up two weeks ago. We lived together and I decided to leave our apartment. I Left the city my law school is located in and have informed my professors and the Dean of a housing crisis but assured them I‚Äôd be back in class soon. \n\nSo I made temporary housing arrangements for the semester. And just got back to the city my school is in. And just as I was preparing to attend class again I found out that I‚Äôm pregnant. \n\nSooo now I need help. I‚Äôve been attending class on zoom and watching the recordings. Im a little behind but nothing crazy, spring break is next week and I plan on using that time to catch up. I guess I‚Äôd like reassurance that I can catch up and do well this semester. Last semester I got a 3.3 on a 2.9 curve. \n\nAlso Im worried about being professional as I communicate my absences with my professors and the Dean. I already told them about the housing crisis but none know I‚Äôm pregnant and I don‚Äôt really want to tell them. So advice on whether it‚Äôs appropriate to tell them I won‚Äôt be in class again this week without giving much detail would be appreciated. \n\nI may be over thinking this. I want to share enough but not too much and I don‚Äôt want these absences to look bad. \n\nThanks everyone!",

I also have a relatively good GPA.  \n\n\nI struggled with anxiety and depression all throughout undergrad and in graduate school I had suicidal ideation and voluntarily committed myself into a program where I was diagnosed Bipolar Type 1. I successfully completed graduate school with my condition, at times unmedicated due to insurance issues. Due to my bipolar I have had periods where it has been very difficult to hold down a job and at one point was going from job to job. I also attempted suicide and was civilly committed. There have been points of sustained long term employment and my supervisors can attest to my character. I also have others who can speak for my character. I am currently in therapy, on medication and have been declared stable. I also do not have an issue when it comes to schooling and school work.\n\nGiven my poor job history will that be an issue? I obviously am going to be straightforward and explain everything, I'm just worried about my history and the stigma.",

I was required to take 5 classes that semester while working at a personal injury law firm in New York City. I am from a small town in Pennsylvania and it was always my dream to go to law school for a long time. I was passionate about it and despite having a good job in pharma right out of school and during covid, I took the leap and moved to New York when I was given the opportunity by a friend who worked there. This friend knew that I wanted to go to school and told me about the program I enrolled in. I went into the program and was let go after the first semester because I failed 1 of the 5 classes that semester, legal writing. I am now back working in Pharmaseuticals and am on track to make more money and have more responsibilies but it is not what I want to do with my life. I am not writing this for pity, I know I failed legal writing for my poor writing of the mid term paper, that was my choice and shouldve been more prepared and or smarter to not go to school and work fulltime. For me though the part that has haunted me is that I did exceptional in the final paper, learning completely from my mistake in the mid term paper. Can anyone let me know if they have also dealt with a dismissal from law school and would it be stupid of me to attempt to go back at 25? Do schools even take students after a dismissal?

I wanted to do that this summer, but I'm not interested in any of the classes offered.  \n\nMy part-time job is something that I will have until graduation, but it varies in hours and work that I do.  I don't have assignments every week, but still, it's something I have for my resume.  \n\nMy question for everyone here is this: how terrible would it be to not do anything my 2L summer ?? (except my part-time remote job) WHICH is a legal position, just not a clerkship or anything fancy like that. It's research. \n\nI really really want some time off before 3L to bring my motivation back.  I have absolutely no interest in getting another internship or working a full-time office job this summer.  I know that this summer is the last \"summer break\" I will ever have in my adult life and I really want to take advantage of it.  I haven't had a vacation in three years and really want one, especially since I plan to do corporate law and know that I won't get a vacation for a while after graduation. \n\nWhat do y'all think of this?  OR do you have any other tips to beef my resume up for the summer without working full-time (at least for the entire summer).",

Everything went to heck with the pandemic and her school did pass/fail grading for two semesters due to the online transition and everything thanks to Covid. Because of that, my partner says her overall GPA really suffered because she didn‚Äôt have enough chances to balance out her worst semester of grades. She graduated from a Northern California law school December 2022 in the top 25% of her class (which I know she was in because she had to maintain it for her scholarship)and has yet to have any job offers. She did not do any internships during school because, in her own words, there just weren‚Äôt any due to the lock down. Since I am not in the law school world at all, I have no idea how this works. She says she has applied through an online portal through the law school and nobody wants her because her grades aren‚Äôt good enough and she didn‚Äôt do an internship. She seems to think she has no job prospects at all for being a lawyer and she is wanting to switch careers because she has no means of gainful employment. Is she correct or is her depression/anxiety getting the better of her?

        "text": "Hi all! I was offered a generous position post-bar with a great firm, and I fully plan on accepting the position. I've been told by a few people that counter-offering their initial offer is expected, and it may be looked down upon if I don't. However, the offer was already generous, and quite frankly I don't feel the need to counter-offer at all. \n\nI drafted an email that asks for an addition $5,000 (a 5% increase), but in the grand scheme of things, it just feels silly. \n\nShould I counter-offer or just accept? For context, it is at a very small boutique firm in a niche, regional field. What do you all think?",

They treated me as one of the lawyers and I was able to gain a ton of experience. Well, the firm took a financial hit and I got laid off (along with about half the firm) and told I no longer had an offer from them. Now I'm a 3L looking for a job in February, where everyone else I know already has a job offer out of school.\n\nDid an okay job networking during my time, but all the feelers and resumes I've sent out have returned nothing, and I'm starting to feel pretty hopeless and desperate (including everyone I'm seeking advice from telling me it's very easy to get a job I shouldn't worry). Any advice from those who have been in my position?",

It is so hard to plan for clerkships that either might not happen or could happen truly anywhere and either immediately after graduation or any number of years after and then plan for where you want to work and which areas/firms would be best for your professional goals all while your partner is also trying to manage graduate school and a career that doesn‚Äôt let us plan with certainty. It feels so impossible sometimes and I feel like such a fool for just hoping that everything will magically work out. But it feels like it‚Äôs all I can do when my relationship with the person I want to spend my life with feels so fragile because of all these unknowns and things out of our control that are also things I really really want to do!",
