She also said that she wanted to have that name since she was 10 years old but has now finally gone public about it.\n\nSo I took to [nl.wikipedia.org](https://nl.wikipedia.org) and updated, updated the article on \"Eddie Izzard\" to include her new name, and corrected her pronouns here and there because the article still referred to Suzy as \"he/him\". I also suggested a move of the article to \"Suzy Eddie Izzard\".\n\nPretty soon, all my changes were undone, including the paragraph I had added about her announcing her new name. And in the discussion, rampant transphobia ensued from a few of the editors who keep undoing my attempts to update the article to reflect Suzy's chosen name and preferred pronouns.\n\nAlmost all the different language articles about Izzard in the whole Wikiverse use her preferred pronouns, several have also already been updated to reflect her new name since she announced it yesterday. I really do not understand why a few editors on the Dutch Wikipedia are so reticent to respect a trans person's chosen name and pronouns...",

The best way to play is with friends. You click your way through Wikipedia to get to the articles you have to find.

        "text": "Hi, does anyone know how to find their account username or where to make contact to at Wikipedia to help recover (or better, delete) an account?\n\nI'm trying to log into Wikipedia after a many years away and am struggling a lot. \n\nMy goal is to delete my account because I've not used it in many years and also never intend to use it.\nDont think I've even made an edit. \n\nNo idea why the password reset page is so obscured and hidden away; there's no 'reset password' on the login page like literally every other site on the Internet.\nBut, eventually I find a YouTube walk through saying to install the app and click reset on the login form there, which I do, but that redirects me to a Web browser. \nAnnoyingly also the page says my IP is blocked so I can't edit and can't reset my password. \n\nAt the time I was on a VPN so firstly I switch to server other servers but still every time I reload the page its still the IP block message. \nInterestingly also I disconnect from VPN but still the IP blocked message persists. \nAfter trying in another browser though I'm able to reset my password. \nIt seems apparently the reason for the message and the message words are not in alignment. \n\nI follow the on screen prompt to enter one of either username or email. I can't remember my username so I enter my email and submit the form. \nThe email I received contained a temp password which was great but said my username is a blank string. \nPerhaps my account was created before usernames were mandatory, I don't know. \n\nUnfortunately log in requires a username so I still can't log in.\nAnd strangely, password resets can be made only once every 24h... Quite obscene. \n\nSo, at this point it seems obvious making contact with someone at Wikipedia is necessary but there seems to be nowhere to send an email to, or perhaps it's just too unclear to me. \nI found a live chat but after clicking the link, it prefils fields to join a server but they're incorrect so can't join live chat. \n\nSo far I've found the Wikipedia reset process to be among the worst of any site I've used. \nIt's baffling at how difficult it is to recover an account or make contact with someone for help.",

Well, I gotta know more about this character and I go to look him up in my favorite internet encyclopedia. But nope. And what's worse is that there is a Chester Hansen entry in Wikipedia already, but it's just some barely known outside of Canada guitarist. So, it's not like someone doesn't know how to spell his name or anything. There's no disambiguation citation link etc.\n\nHow can this be? He didn't die til 2012, so he could've lived long enough to say that thing ain't for me and openly prevent it somehow I guess. But he is dead now and of some distinct historical significance. Does some, banal pop music guitarist born in 1992(no offense kid) get more interest and recognition than a man who looked like he could've done wet-work for the CIA and absolutely did have a front-row seat for World War 2 get shut out of an entry? Or is there some rational reason for this? The kitty cat doesn't need to be strangled or anything but do put it out of its misery please.",
