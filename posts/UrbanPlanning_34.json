        "text": "Most American cities that got rid of limited access expressways turned them into surface boulevards, but I feel like getting rid of an exclusive ROW is a pretty bad a idea. \n\nwhat would be better IMO would be to maybe fill in 1/2 and either turn it into a greenway or open it up for development or even add a lane to surface streets that usually run parallel . Leave 2-3 lanes intact and turn it into BRT or Light Rail.\n\nan example of this is the Kensington Expressway in Buffalo, it ends its exclusive ROW ~1000ft from the Fountain Square Metro Rail Station and Runs Northeast from Downtown past the Buffalo Science museum and to the Airport. If something were to happen with it turning it into a surface Boulevard would be total waste of a ROW.\n\nAny thoughts?\n",

        "text": "I graduated last year from a state university with a bachelor's in public policy and urban studies, and managed to get a job as a planner for a small municipality after interning for some time. I've been thinking about getting my master's but am running into a dilemma. My director at work is pretty laid back and willing to let me flexible with my schedule if I start attending classes again. However, the urban planning master's program at my local university is absolutely not geared towards working professionals with their class times, the core urban planning classes are all throughout the middle of the day during the week. This is in contrast to their MPA program, which is geared towards working professionals with classes in the evening. The options I've been considering are: \n\n1) Make the MUP work by just taking 1 or 2 core classes at a time, taking longer than 2 years to complete the program.\n\n 2) Do the MPA program with the offered concentration on urban governance. I'm not sure if this would really be helpful to my career/ knowledge-wise, however. I know I want to stay in the public sector, so maybe this would come in handy one day for a job as a department director. \n\n3) Do the online urban planning master's through University of Florida. The price is ridiculous ($40k!), but it's the only online MUP program I've found. \n\n4) Don't do my master's because I'll do fine without it, and just focus on studying to get AICP certified. \n\nAny insight or advice would be much appreciated!

My hypothesis is that after accounting for the harmful impacts, including pollution and health, freeways do more harm than good.

So it could keep up with bicycles. https://youtu.be/e6phdEF67fM\n\nOne advantage I can think of is that they're smaller so you can bring it inside with you and keep it in your office/cubicle. In another post a user commented that it's small enough to fold up and take on the train with you. Unfortunately I don't see a way of carrying more than a backpack of cargo.\n\nWould you ever consider one? What do you think of them using bike lanes?",

We are using leftover STBG funding in order to create a \"distracted driving awareness and prevention campaign\" which will consist of several different commercials that air on \\(TV, Youtube, etc.\\) throughout our area. I am reaching out to you, as I am interested in knowing if anyone has any good statistics on distracted driving that aren't normally covered in these kinds of campaigns. Along the line's of \"a single look at your phone and you're car can travel the length of a football field\"\\-stats, as an example.  Gotta be accurate and verifiable. Feel free to reply by comment or DM. It would help a brotha out   ☮ ✌   \n\n\\(\\*if I'm violating this subreddit's rules with this post, it's unintentional. I'm new to this whole thing and couldn't find anything that clarified one way or the other\\) ",

I've enjoyed the major, but I've started to realize I am much more interested in geography, urban planning, environmental planning, policy etc. I think I really want to apply to an Urban Planning Masters Program for fall 2019. \n\nDespite losing a lot of interest in Geology, I'll still finish my major out and take the final courses my senior year but I also have room for electives. I plan on taking GIS and Advanced GIS my senior year and have room for another course. Would you say remote sensing or Urban Geography is a more useful course for someone looking to apply to planning school graduate programs? \n\nAny advice would be helpful!",
