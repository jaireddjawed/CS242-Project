We tried but it just wasn't working out. We never really officially end things but basically that was that. Told her I wouldn't message and bother her anymore. She removed me a while ago from her close friends list (even mentioned how I kept her on mine for a while while we had a period where we stopped talking).\n\nNow randomly opened instagram tonight and saw a close friend story of a \"from archive\" thing instagram has. Pretty weird considering she is the type of person that would just call or text me usually, and I highly doubt you put the one person you stopped being friends with in your close friends by accident so.. Do I even bother asking her whats up with that? We never removed each other on social media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr told my girl best friend i liked her, stopped being friends shortly after. after a couple of months of not speaking she randomly adds me on her close friends list?",

        "text": "\nHello everyone! I apologize for how long this is but I’m just looking for some advice on what to do in a situationship &amp; maybe how to move forward. Unfortunately I think I’ve bit off more than I can chew and I’m confused if maybe I should just take the L or keep going. \n\nI was friends with this guy in highschool for awhile, we dated but broke up due to me graduating &amp; moving away. We deeply cared for each other &amp; he’s always been special to me &amp; I’d consider him my first love/best friend. He’s seen me at my lowest &amp; has never judged me. \n\nAfter moving away we stayed friends but ofc moved on and dated other people until about last year when there was a shift. I was honest that I still liked him but wasn’t ready for a relationship as I got out of a long term relationship about 6 months prior. He admitted the same but he got out of one like a month before so he was focused on school which I understood. Since then we’ve been in a weird LDR where we FaceTimed everyday and saw each other occasionally (he would drive down) Here’s where things get a lil… confusing.\n\nAround October he opened up saying that he LOVES me &amp; he’s never clicked this way with anyone. He mentioned wanting to introduce me to his mom (which he did) so most of his family knows me and speaks to me and even says they love me. His dad told me personally he knows his son cares about me etc. He’s introduced me to his friends as well &amp; includes me in there convos. \n\nI just visited him for a few days and we had a convo about if it would be awkward between us if one of us started dating someone else. I said yeah kinda, and he said it wouldn’t really be for him but he’s not necessarily an awkward person. We’d just have to change our relationship. I didn’t know how to feel &amp; he could see that in my face &amp; and asked me what’s up.\n\n I figured I’d ask him where we stood because it has been a year and I have no idea where things were going. He said he “never likes to say never” to the idea of us dating &amp; he does really like spending time with me, but he’s not ready for a relationship still which I understand &amp; respect but it did kind of..hurt?\n\nHe’s a sweetheart. He supports my dreams &amp; encourages me/reassures me. He listens to my long rants &amp; gives feedback. He can read me like a book, &amp; knows I suck at communicating &amp; pushes me to do better &amp; practice with him. He constantly asks me about my views on relationships or what I want in a husband/boyfriend. We have a lot in common &amp; can talk for hours. He’s a complete gentleman &amp; is super attentive and ofc has flaws but he’s so sweet to me so I guess I’m just lost on how to proceed.\n\nIt sucks because he wants me to be vulnerable with him and tell him everything on my heart but I close myself off because if this doesn’t work out I’ll be destroyed &amp; I can’t let my walls down yet. \n\nI don’t see a point of this relationship if it isn’t going to go anywhere. We live about 3 hours apart but obviously I don’t want to do this weird LDR forever. I do really love him but I can’t tell if he’s just super nice &amp; keeping me around for sex or if he actually just really wants to focus on what he needs to do. Wondering if I should just honestly just let it go at this point because I really don’t wanna get heartbroken. At this point he’s the only guy I’ve ever felt like this for so it does hurt &amp; I’d hate to loose someone so important to me over this. \n\nTDLR; first love &amp; I have rekindled and we’re in a LDR situation-ship. He said he loves me but he’s still not ready for a relationship and I’m scared I’m wasting my time.",

        "text": "I (21F) had just made two new friends at college (both 19F), and I was crushing on one of them. For the sake of anonimity, let's call them... Lucy and Mary. So, I was pretty into Mary from the get go (she's bi btw), but I didn't want to tell her straight up because I feared that would ruin our friendship that was just forming. Instead, I confided in Lucy about it, who tried to help me cope with my feelings, and was overall very supportive.\n\nI was always pretty insecure about being around them though, because despite we having all met for the first time on the same day, Mary and Lucy seemed to be way closer to each other than to me. At first I just tought their personalities just clicked better, but after a while it started to feel as if they were leaving me out of things on purpose and talking about me behind my back.\n\nI would ask them if there's anything that I'm doing wrong, if I'm being weird, if I'm making them uncomfortable, I'd give them ample opportunity to tell me if I've done something wrong, anything, but they always assure me that there's nothing wrong with me.\n\nI've always tried to be supportive of them and have shown interest in what they like to talk about, to try and give them company when I had the time, to hear them out when they had something to say, to give them headpats and hugs whenever they looked sad or tired, and so on. Despite my best efforts at estabilishing a positive connection though, they would rarely open up to me, and would sometimes outright avoid me, which is part of why I started growing insecure in the first place. I do have abandonment issues too, and I've mentioned that in passing to them once or twice as well.\n\nAnyways, after a month and a half of being friends with them, I thought it would be cute to give Mary a silly flirt letter telling her that I liked her. Nothing serious or anything, just a dumb flirt (which I honestly don't even remember what it was), to see how she would react.\n\nWell, after that, things went to shit.\n\nLet's just say that the next day they started avoiding me more than usual, and by the time class ended they told me that our friendship wasn't being healthy, and that we should stop talking. Apparently, I was being suffocating and invading their personal space, which is something they never voiced directly to me whenever I asked them if I had done anything wrong in the many times I felt they were avoiding me without reason. Point being, they just ditched me, broke off what I thought had been a friendship, and for what?\n\nI really don't know what I have done wrong in this situation, and I've tried being as thorough as possible in my retelling of events. So, in plain talk, what did I do to warrant this treatment from them?\n\nTL;DR: I tried being friends with two girls in college, started crushing one of them, but they apparently hate me for no reason that I can perceive, other than I constantly tried being nice to them.",

I love her to pieces.

        "text": "Hello and thanks for any advice.\n\nI find my boyfriend very difficult to get along with a lot of the time. We've been living together for about 4 years now, and I'd thought we'd started to do better recently, but we seem to be regressing hardcore. Throughout our relationship, he has always accused me of being controlling.\n\nSomething we've always argued about is his loudly playing music in the house. Today, we were putting together a piece of furniture in the living room, and he gets on his phone and starts playing music through the TV. First of all, the music is this emo, angsty stuff he knows I hate. Secondly, it was so loud that I had to raise my voice to be able to have him hear me, which is not ideal when trying to read directions and put something together. I said \"that's really loud\" and he, immediately defensive, started sighing, saying \"fuck's sake\" and \"oh my GOD\" and \"it's not loud at all.\" I went and got the controller and turned it down a click or two to a more reasonable level. He immediately grabbed it from me and turned it back up. I said \"seriously?\" and we had a minor argument about it, but I just let him keep it on.\n\nHe was being terse and weird after we were done and I asked him what was wrong and he said he was so sick of me controlling him. I asked how I was controlling, and he said I was being controlling by turning down the music. I told him it's not controlling to ask to turn down loud music in a common space. He said it objectively wasn't loud, and I WAS being controlling, and it was wrong. We started arguing because I thought that was one of the most ridiculous things I've heard.\n\nHe then started to tell me that I \"try to control everything about him all the time.\" I asked for examples, and he referenced that, when he picked me up from the airport after a trip a few weeks ago, I was upset because he was in a bad mood. I was, because I had been really excited to see him after a couple weeks away and he was in a horrible mood, barely looking at me and complaining about his life over the past couple weeks. I got upset about this and told him it made me feel sad that he was being so negative when I just got back and we got into an argument. APPARENTLY, me getting upset with him in that situation was also \"controlling him\" because I \"was trying to force him to be in a different mood\" (WTF?!)\n\nAnyway, I think this is all insane, but I'm sitting here crying and really need a sanity check, or some advice about how to go forward with this or whether to just end it. I'm tired of this, and tired of feeling like I'm always doing something controlling or abusive. Any advice would be really appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend thinks I'm always trying to control him over very minor things.",

        "text": "I’ve been in this retail job for about 8 months now. One of my managers has maintained a very close casual friendship with me and my coworkers all &gt;20 years old. We used to spend a lot of time hanging outside of work together.\n\nFrom the start, he had been very friendly and supportive to me while also being very sarcastic and edgy at times. His jokes often have a sexual or politically charged slant. He has said incredibly sexist things about women in the past but I assumed he was joking bc he said he’s a feminist. Through our conversations and my social media he has found out a lot about my sexual history and personal life and has made comments about it at work. He has made comments about how my body looks in clothes and how kinky I am. \n\nI was attracted to him for a time and I am very eager to get his approval so I believe I flirted with him without really meaning to. I have also said things that are inappropriate to say believing that our casual store culture would excuse it. I feel complicit in how far things have gone. However, he now makes me feel deeply unsafe and on edge at work. He speaks ill of both my boyfriend and his own girlfriend so I believe he is trying to drive a wedge between us. He has bragged about being a “home wrecker” who makes women realise how shit their bfs are. He’s dating a girl 7 years younger than him who he met working my same role. His previous girlfriends also worked under him and were 5-10 years younger than him at the time.\n\nHe told his gf I made a move on him because when he asked if I was attracted to him I admitted I was. \nHe says he’s not interested in me, and I believe that (at least not interested romantically) but he does treat me like a piece of meat at times and play bizarre power games with me. Our dynamic is not one I can feasibly work in any longer.\n\nI brought this up in a routine well-being meeting with upper management but I said I didn’t want to pursue a full investigation. However, after finding out he’s been accused of multiple instances of “sleaziness” with female members of staff in the past I couldn’t allow myself to not report it. The thought of him treating another girl like this made me sick.\n\nAm I definitely okay to have decided to report him? Will I have incriminated myself should he choose to claim I said inappropriate things too? Have I made things unsafer for myself by reporting?\n\nTLDR: I get the sense that my manager is really creepy and habitually predatory but I’m worried the way I acted (i.e. flirty/overly personal) will either “justify” his behaviour or get me in trouble",

        "text": "We started talking 2 months ago, dated for one. During the few weeks we dated, he was sweet, charming, bought me flowers and cooked me dinner on valentines day, put up with me on my worst days, texted me good morning and good night and asked how my day was. He was really attractive and honestly we had the best sex ever and he was the only one to make me orgasm with another person.\n\nProblem is I just got out of a LTR with the father of my kids in about september last year and was still having trouble processing how to make new relationships work. I am the middle of a career change, a house move, and I still have to take care of my kids - he also lives an hour away. All this made it really hard to find time to spend with him. I had also been on sort of a tinder binge since my last breakup, and hadnt really seen myself settling with any of them til i met this guy.\n\nWe kind of love bombed each other and things got really heavy really fast and I realized about 3 weeks in that it was too much. I really was falling hard for him, even loved him in my own way. But it suddenly hit me how hard it'd be to make a relationship work and I broke it off with him telling him i wasnt ready for how fast we were going. He told me to take the week and think about it, and see if we'd want to start over and go slower or end things altogether. When we met, I just melted into his arms and his sweet kisses and told him i'd agree to start over.\n\nThings were fine for the next week, and I agreed to our weekly date night. until one night he sent me something super flirty and it just reminded me again that we wont be able to take a step back from each other. in my own sort of fucked up way, i tried to cleanse myself of the relationship by sleeping with an old tinder date that had randomly texted me that same night. when he texted me the next morning wondering what happened, i snapped at him and told him again i wasnt ready and it was over. \n\nlater that night i felt bad for snapping at him, so i texted him again. we started fighting again, but eventually realized i hate fighting with him, he really is a good person. i also realized in that moment, we really could have worked if i had not done what i did, and i regretted it. so i told him about it. i told him i really do love him, will regret that choice forever, that no one ever made me feel as special as he did, and that i loved the time we spent together even if it was short; and i meant it all. he expressed how heartbroken he was because we had a lot of things in common and were honestly really compatible, so he saw a future with us, and i ruined it. i told him i had to block him after that talk because it wasnt fair to him to have someone who did what i did when he's as great as he is. we said our final goodbye, and thats what i did.\n\n2 days later i got a text from one of his friends cussing me out for basically cheating on him. i tried to be calm about it but it did kind of hurt. i kind of deserved it. fine.\n\nit's been a week since that, and today he just messaged me on facebook since i havent unblocked his number me this: \" Hey (my name). It’s ok if you don’t answer this, I wanted to write it out for myself. Been doing a lot of research in self help and even talked to a therapist this week.  We talked about how we both have a lot of growing to do, and I realized how many of my own issues I had and how to better understand yours.

        "text": "\nThe past week in my relationship has been hell.\n\nMe and my girlfriend have been together since we were 16 and 15 in highschool. We’re 23 and 22 now and about to graduate college. So nearly 8 years. We weren’t sexually active our first few years of dating due to trauma and nerves, and it built some really bad and gross habits. Namely, when I was in highschool I was dependent on masturbating even though I was in a relationship. I had a strict parents that monitored my safari and set restrictions, so I didnt have porn.\n\nI ended up having to use instagram even before me and gf started dating and grossly masturbated to girls I knew in real life. Its gross and disgusting and even as a 13 year old I felt gross. These habits never stopped. Im so ashamed but I do still masturbate to people we went to school with and know irl. \n\nLast night I confessed to her and she said she has had fantasies before like I did but never really went to social media and look at pictures, and that it really hurt her that I had been doing this for our whole relationship. I didnt do this exclusively and ended up using porn as well when I got my own phone, but enough to where it was definetly creepy and I feel gross for it. I just feel like I had no one to talk to about those urges as I felt like it would hurt my girlfriend and I was afraid of breaking up.\n\nI have since deleted all my social media and will change no matter the result. Me and my girlfriend are just having a tough time getting through this since weve only ever had each other.\n\nI guess Im wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? Is this a total dealbreaker for most people and what should I do moving forward to fix things? Ive been terrible to her this whole time and she deserves better but wants to fix stuff with me\nsince shes felt those urges too but hasnt acted on them and since we got together at such a young age.\n\nTL;DR I have some sexual baggage in my life and carried it throughout my relationship with my highschool sweetheart and am wanting to change and fix things.",

        "text": "TL;DR: my wife manages a local business. It was going great until it wasn't, now all her insecurities have flared back up and she's having a breakdown about work. What do I do??\n\n----\n\nWe have been together for 7 years, and seen each other through thick and thin. I am at a loss with her about her job right now though. \n\nMy wife manages a successful local retail business. She has only been there a year, but rose through the ranks quickly, and earned the trust of the owner.\n\nIn fact, things have been going so well that the owner sat us down to propose selling her the business. This happened last summer, and I immediately had some reservations. It's an amazing opportunity. But from the get-go I was worried about my wife's stress level. Historically, she takes work drama too seriously and has trouble with work/life balance.\n\nMy wife spent weeks, if not the following months, trying to prove that she could handle it. She was excited about this potential deal, excited about her work, responsibility, and team. We went on several out-and-about dates, while she tried to show me we could have a healthy home life, and that she could set that boundary.\n\nIn Dec, we went to visit my wife's family. They generally treat my wife like trash. Specifically, my wife's mom treats her like she's the biggest disappointment in the world. She's an emotionally immature martyr nightmare who has done untold damage to my wife's self-esteem over the years. \n\nAfter that trip, her confidence was obviously shaken. We got back and right away my wife jumped into planning her store's holiday party. She was supposed to have help from a little party committee, but ended up doing everything herself. Also during this time, she started to get pulled by the owner into more \"back of house, administrative\" type tasks, taking her off the retail floor for larger amounts of time. \n\nFrom her perspective, this is when things \"started to go wrong.\" My wife began to fear that a group of her younger employees (aged 18-21) were gossiping about her behind her back. She felt extra stressed trying to balance being a floor manager, with the demand of \"behind the scenes\" responsibilities.\n\nThis is when the work/home balance began to slip. My wife started to come home worried that so-and-so was upset with her, and that vibes were off. She felt sure that there was a groupchat or gossip train talking about what a terrible boss she is. She complained of getting attitude, and trying to talk to her employees while being told \"everything is fine, nothing is wrong.\"\n\nWhen Feb hit, my wife had a team meeting. The owner took six weeks off for vacation, leaving her completely in charge. She sat down with the team and said \"this month is going to be stressful. Let's help each other out, be empathetic towards each other. I'll do my best to support you all.\"\n\nOver the course of February, however, four employees quit. Understandably, my wife was freaked out. Each person who quit had their reasons- I've discussed each at length with my wife- but she admitted that she was still taking it personally. She reflected a lot on times she had micro-managed or been disorganized, and we spent a lot of time at home talking about it.\n\nShe was particularly focused on a young woman, \"Ann,\" who has been a thorn in her side for a while. Ann is only 19, and this retail shop was her first and only job so far. She had a huge ego about how \"the store would fall apart without her.\" She also adored the previous manager and never seemed to respect my wife much. Ann ended up getting sick mid-Feb, and called out of her shifts for a week straight - not COVID, and not a cold, an undiagnosed mystery illness. When she finally came back to work, she said she was still sick, and was going to go to the ER the next morning. Apparently my wife called her into her office, and told her \"if you're so sick that you're going to the ER tomorrow, why are you here? Go to the ER now.\" Of course I don't know the details of this conversation, but apparently Ann ran out of the store crying, and put in her two weeks right after. Her reason was quote \"work isn't fun anymore.\" \n\nSince then, my wife has been worried about her workplace nonstop. Forget work/home balance, my wife's thoughts are obsessively on work all day and all night. We've talked it through, and she's aware that her thoughts are spiraling and overly negative, but she doesn't know how to turn it off. She's started to get depressed and chaotic, creating scenarios in her head where the owner fires her (even though she's about to be salaried), where everyone hates her, where the business fails because of her. She has had to hire and train tirelessly, and feels that training is going poorly and the new employees must think it's a shit show. \n\nIt is ALL we talk about. We haven't talked about her new nephew being born, or interviews I have coming up, or our friends in NM who want to call, or even household stuff. Normally she's pretty on top of things like dish soap and laundry pods; lately I've just been up keeping the home without her really noticing.\n\nThis all came to a head yesterday, where a fifth employee put in her two weeks. This employee was a major gut-punch, as she is a quiet hard-working young woman who showed no signs of quitting. My wife had a call with the owner, who seemed totally unfazed, and then broke down. For the last 24 hours she's been sobbing on and off, circling her work worries over and over again, needing reassurance. \n\nShe had night sweats and panic attacks all night, and trudged to work this morning after crying in the shower. The owner promptly sent her home because she was crying at her desk, and took over hiring interviews for the day. \n\nMy wife just seems EXHAUSTED. She never allows herself to disattach from work, or relax fully. She'll get high and play video games and take a bath and still be thinking about work. She says repeatedly that no one is supporting her, deviating between self-pity and self-loathing. She agrees she needs therapy, and even booked a therapist for a couple weeks out. But the way she talks is so illogical and self-depricating that I'm really worried about her.\n\nI'm also exhausted myself. I've been supportive non-stop, but nothing gets through to her. She doesn't listen to anything I say. She will thank me later for the support, but can't seem to recall anything I actually said since she's so stuck in the abyss of her own thoughts.\n\nThe thing is, is that I CALLED this. My wife has had a lot of terrible jobs in our years together, and they have always stressed her out. This is her cycle: 1. feel confident at a wage-slave job, be relaxed and chatty. 2. Overhear gossip or mis-interpret a comment, suddenly realize she annoyed someone by being loud and chatty. 3. Overcompensate and become insecure, worrying over co-worker relationships. 4. Hate the job and hate herself for being bad a wage-slave job. 5. Find a new job where she can make a fresh start. \n\nJust, this time around, she's the BOSS. And she likes this job and is actually very good at it. Her rampant insecurities have finally come to a head in a situation that demands she gets over them. And we're getting older now- this isn't us at 22 complaining about another 22 year old. This is her at 32, the boss of 22 year olds, worried that they're gossiping behind her back.\n\nShe keeps saying to me that she is a broken mess of a person. I love her so much, it's painful. She's a smart, tender, vibrant, and painfully gentle-hearted person. I don't know how to help her, or what more to even say. I'm exhausted myself and frustrated by this, like, self-fulfilled prophecy I saw coming a mile away.\n\nAny advice is highly appreciated, thank you.",

        "text": " I recently had a guy (27M) online that started discussing a date with me. He suggested we go out for dinner and then asked me if I expected men to pay. I ghosted him.\n\nThen he found me on another site and said \"Sorry if anything I said rubbed you the wrong way, happy to invite you out for dinner, on me\"! so I said okay I'll be nice and give him a chance.\n\nI picked a restaurant near me since I have no car and he drove up to see me. However when we looked at the menu he started sighing and groaning about the prices and when I questioned him as to whether it was too expensive (nothing was over 30 dollars), he said \"No I want to\". I thought he meant it. He paid but seemed upset.\n\nThen he suggested we meet again, and also talked about taking me to a theme park this weekend. So I decided to give him one more chance. This time, after we ate, he just left the check sitting there and refused to touch it. A long time passed and I had to ask him \"Do You wanna get that?\"\n\nBefore I could even finish my sentence he just gave me a blank stare and said \"NO\". This insulted me because I thought he wanted to be a gentleman and keep courting me. He then noticed I was upset and I thought he would realize he was being mean, but instead he got FURIOUS. He said \"cut it out\" or I'll get up and leave\"! viciously. Then he started bragging about all the other women that wanted him. He said I needed to pay because \"equality\".\n\nI wanted to just walk out but I was afraid he would run after me and stab me or something. So I was like whatever and I took out my card and handed it to the waitress with his, so I thought we were splitting it. Then the waitress came back and said \"Sorry his card got declined, I had to put the dinner on yours\", and this guy was SO excited and happy when he saw the shocked look on my face. He also warned me I'll get bigger if I keep trying to go out with guys for meals.\n\nI wanted to ask for his half of the meal back but the waitress said the manager wasn't there and I was so embarrassed. This guy then tried to talk me home and put his arms around me and then said he had to pee really badly when we reached my house. I didn't even want him to walk me home, but he tried to get me to go in his car and I said NO so he followed me down the 12 minute walk back to my home. He carried my food (he didn't offer, but I asked him because he was just following me as I was struggling to walk home in my high heels and he said \"sometimes couples fight\" and carried it for me.\n\nI have a roommate so I said fine just go to shut him up, then after he got out of the bathroom, he kicked off his shoes, sat down, and started relaxing then looked shocked when I asked him to leave, and asked if we could go outside and talk about it. I said no and my roommate was there so he finally left.\n\nThen I week later he said he's sad I asked him to leave and it was mean of me to ditch him just because he didn't automatically pay for dinner and he wishes we could have kissed a bit and was hoping to meet again and he was thinking about how cute and interesting I was. Thoughts?\n\nI think it was kind of phony for him to say he wanted to take me out for dinner and then do it the first time, but then basically force me to pay him back in full the second time we went out.\n\nTLDR: Guy refused to pay for my dinner and it offended me",

On the other hand, every few days she’ll let us have sex and say she loves me.\n\nMy gut is telling me she’s trying to make it an easy life because leaving would be logistically and financially difficult for her.

I really want to believe I’m wrong and so far I’ve been going through the motions too hoping she was being genuine.

        "text": "I’m sorry if my grammar isn’t perfect, I’m not a native english speaker. \n\nOkay, here we go! \n\nI (24 F) met a guy (27) about six weeks ago through some mutual friends at uni. (Since then we’ve seen each other pretty much everyday at uni, together with our friends). The first time we met we were out with our friends and we really hit it off. We share the same interests for books and movies and we spent the night talking about it. At the end of the night he invited me home and I said yes because it felt so right, even though I usually don’t go home with guys the first time I meet them. \n\nAfter that night, he reached out to me and we’ve since been seeing each other, just the two of us, for two or three times a week (beyond hanging out at uni every day). We realized that we have a lot in common and when we see each other we talk A LOT. We hang out, we cook together, we watch a lot of movies and talk about literature and other things. He has told me so many private things that I feel like I now know everything about him, and vice versa. I know that he was in a relationship for five years that ended a year ago. I know that he felt pretty choked in the last two years of that relationship since his ex was dealing with mental health problems. She was very controlling, didn’t let him travel or hang out with his friends without blowing up his phone and giving him a bad conscience all the time. When they broke up, they both knew it was for the best and there is no bad blood between them today. He moved in with a friend for a while until he got his own apartment just a few months ago. This is the first time he is living by himself, since he moved in with his friends right after high school an then moved in with his ex. \n\nA month after we met I felt like I had to know if he saw our relationship as something casual or if he thought there might be potential for something more in the future. He said that you never know what might happen but that he’s not searching for a relationship since he has made a lot of traveling plans with his friends in the summer and also because he is feeling pretty bad about being almost 30 and never lived alone before. He says that he needs to keep working on himself for a while before he can commit to anything, but that it’s stupid to be completely closed to the possibility of falling for someone - “if it happens, it happens”. He also said that with me he sees it as we’re getting to know each other to see what happens, and that he really likes spending time with me since we’re so much alike and have a lot of fun together. \n\nI was satisfied with the answer because all I really wanted to know was if it was casual or not. Anyways, we kept seeing each other and I even spent three days in a row at his place. One of those nights, he accidentally opened Tinder on his phone when he was going to show me something. He apologized profusely and was really ashamed. I didn’t worry, since I also have Tinder and use it from time to time to pass some time. But this whole thing got us into the discussion of dating and I asked him if he has dated a lot and he said that he hasn’t. He said a that Tinder was basically just to pass time and that he is too shy to meet someone for a real date because it so easily gets awkward. “I haven’t dated much at all, maybe like two times if I don’t count our dates”. \n\nWe met again a few days ago and I was writing on my essay while he cooked for me. He told me that it’s so comfortable to hang out with me because he feels so safe with me, like he could tell me anything, and that he doesn’t feel that way with anyone else.\n\nHere is the issue: except for when we see each other irl, we barely talk. Not on social media or anything. I know that he is not a texter or a frequent user of social media, but it feels strange. If you like someone, I’d think you’d want to reach out to them, right? I also saw on a friends phone that he added another picture to his Tinder profile… As I said, I also use Tinder but it still feels weird…\n\nAs you can see, there’s a number of things pointing towards him not being interested in me but I also feel like there’s a lot of things pointing towards the opposite. \n\nI know that he told me that he is not really looking for a relationship, but he also said that it wasn’t out of the question. I’m pretty sure that his idea of a relationship is connected to how it was with his ex: he fears that he will be controlled again and maybe that a relationship will get in the way of his traveling plans. However, I am not like her. I value personal space and freedom highly. I would never be controlling nor want to be controlled. \n\nWe’ve only been seeing each other for six weeks so it’s too early to get into a relationship, even for me, but I feel like I truly like him, and I want him to like me too. I know I could ask but I don’t want to seem pushy. What do you guys think? Is it doomed? He doesn’t want a relationship (with me) and I should just let it go? Or is there a chance? Should I ask?\n\nI’m so scared of him not liking me back. Partly because I truly enjoy spending time with him and I don’t want to lose that. And, partly, because we will keep seeing each other Every. Single. Day. Because of our mutual friends. I don’t want to hear about him meeting someone else and I don’t know how to get over him when he’s there all the time. What do I do? Am I being overly anxious? \n\nTL;DR! Dated a guy for six weeks who said he isn’t looking for a relationship but that it’s stupid to say that there isn’t a possibility that he will fall for someone anyways. He said that we are really good together and that he wants to get to know me. He seems like he likes me but is also showing signs of not liking me, like not reaching out over the phone when we’re not seeing each other. It’s only been six weeks but I’m afraid that I’m falling and he’s not. Do I ask? We see each other every day since we have mutual friends at uni and I don’t want it to be awkward and I don’t want to hear about him seeing someone else.\n\nPlease help me think straight. I feel like i’m going insane and I probably sound like it as well.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "We broke up officially about 2 weeks ago. Before that, she said she needed time to think about our relationship and that took about 2 weeks until the day we met and broke it off, as she suggested we shouldn’t be together, “at least not right now.”\n\nI saw this coming and expected the breakup, so I wasn’t so surprised and didn’t feel any sort of shock when she suggested we break it off. We spent the rest of the day together, ending things on a good note and I kept catching this admirable gaze from the whole time I was driving us to get food. She was very lovey and caring with me. I didn’t think much of it in the moment and tried operating my way through our time that day as if it was just me.\n\nWe had sex that day and she started crying midway, holding me and kissing me passionately.\n\nA week goes by and she texts me randomly by the time I was sleeping. I reply the next day midday and we have a small convo and she stops texting back. She decided to text me back 2 days later, in which I reply within the hour and then she takes hours to text back before she takes flight on girls trip to Bali. I never replied and it’s been over a week.\n\nI’ve had time to reflect and realize I was just being used as validation this whole time. \n\nI slowed down going out with her starting the second half of last year because every time we did, it was almost as if she wasn’t present wherever we went and was busy looking elsewhere, as if to make sure guys are checking her out. Whenever we would walk past a group of guys, she distanced herself way in front of me or way behind me as if to indicate she was open. Whenever we would go to a bar, it was like I was just some sort of friend while she was fishing for guys to give her attention. While we were out at events, she would continue this behavior. At dinner, in public, gatherings, malls. \n\nI would call her out on this and she would deny it, saying it’s all in my head. I tried convincing myself it’s all in my head.\n\nWhat resulted is me wanting to spend less time out in public with her, and more time together in private. It made me more isolated from even wanting to go out with my friends, and she made more of an effort to go out with her own friends. I believe this led to her being fed up with me. \n\nNow I see her texts as a way to check if I’m still there, and that’s all the validation she needs from me. I haven’t replied or reached out at all during these past few weeks.\n\nI’m hurt after coming to this realization. I haven’t been hurting as I agree this needed to end, though thinking of being just a form of validation this whole time just took a blow on me.\n\nI’m confused and just venting here since I don’t even feel comfortable sharing this with friends or family. I hope she could change, though that is up to her and not me. The closest thing she’s come to acknowledge her behavior is admitting she has bad self-confidence and saying we both have areas we need to work on about us.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. Thanks!\n\nTl;dr: Girlfriend and I recently broke up, keeps texting and ghosting as if to check if I’m still there for her. Realizing this is a form of seeking validation and realizing the relationship was used as validation.",

The last 2 years, we've been having sex less and less. Now we only do it once every 4-6 weeks, and it's quite boring and routine. \n\nWe communicate really well, and talk through disagreements pretty quickly.  we have great friends, both our families get on well, he has a daughter, who I consider my step daughter. currently they're 10 years old, and we have a great relationship.\n\nWe share some similar hobbies and and respect each others different interests. \nFinances are shared equally based on a percentage of earnings, so not 50/50 unfairly. We have pet cats together. \n\nOur chores are equally taken care of, and there's never any fuss over who does what. \n\nBesides the sex, it seems like we're the perfect couple and have talked about getting married, and having kids together. \n\nBut I feel like I'm not completely happy, and am just settling for and easy, but not overly fulfilling life.\n\nI know how good I have it, and feel awful for wanting more. We love each other dearly, but there's no excitement. \n\nWhen we aren't working or with friends, we mostly just watch TV together snuggled in the sofa.\n\nWe rarely passionately even make out, our kisses are mostly gentle pecks, as hes grown a beard, and says kissing now feels wierd.\n\n\nHe has taken care of me and supported me through so much, at times when I've been in debt, he has patiently helped me, looks after me when I am sick, and when I have struggled with work while I decided a new career path. \n\nHow do you break up from such a loving relationship with a really nice person?\n\n\n\nTL;DR Should I break up from my more or less perfect loving relationship besides a lack of sex?",

We would see each other once a week and would have sex like three times in a day. We now live together and we had a wee bit of a pregnancy scare a while back. Since then, we haven't really had sex. Maybe once a month, once every two months. I completely understand why the pregnancy scare would worry him. But I'm really struggling not having sex. I miss the intimacy, I miss holding each other close, I miss feeling connected. I try not to mention it though, because I never ever want him to feel pressured, but whenever I do bring it up, it causes a bit of tension. I'm just not really sure what to do.\n\nTL/dr; boyfriend and I rarely have sex and I don't know what to do",

        "text": "  \n\n\nMy friend has a lot of trauma/mental illness and sometimes she talks to me about it. I'm always happy to listen, but unfortunately I have issues of my own and am not always able to process the things she tells me in a healthy way. This has gotten a lot better recently; the event mentioned in the post title actually happened over 2 years ago. I was going through my worst period with depression and anxiety at that time, and then I woke up to a text where my friend casually revealed that she'd been assaulted as a child. I kind of went into shock for the rest of the day because the knowledge really really messed with my head, and I was so visibly miserable that my mom started questioning me about it- she got pretty insistent, and because I was so messed up in the moment and really needed an outlet, I ended up telling her what my friend had told me.  \n\n\nTo be fair, I very much downplayed it/didn't go into detail (and I worded it ambiguously so that it sounded like a more recent, \"\"milder\"\" assault like an instance of groping at a club or smth, it's been a while but I'm fairly sure I did not mention it was something from her childhood. My mom doesn't speak English and our native language makes 'vague' wording like this a lot easier). I think I succeeded because my mom didn't have a strong reaction to it and didn't mention it again. I also forgot about the entire conversation, partially because I just didn't want to think about what my friend told me.   \n\n\nBut this memory just resurfaced today for no apparent reason and I'm feeling a lot of guilt over it. I think it's right for me to feel guilty because I should \\*not\\* have talked about it to anyone, but I also don't know if bringing it up to my friend would help at this point, especially since my mom doesn't even remember this as far as I know/doesn't particularly care. (+ my friend lives abroad and has never met my family.) I also feel crappy remembering the entire thing because I don't want to play the victim, but hearing about this was legitimately horrifying to me at 16, especially because I was already heavily depressed at the time. I'm just not sure what to do. Any second opinions would be appreciated.  \n\n\nTl;dr: impulsively gave a vague account of friend's trauma to my mom when I was 16, because I didn't know how to handle the information on my own. Don't know what to do about it.",

I did some digging and found out she is a prostitute in our town. When I confronted him, he told me he didn’t even know she was an escort. After more questions, he finally admitted he had been researching escorts in our town. He followed her because her account was on private and he was curious to see what she was posting. \n\nHe says he has a porn addiction and it has gotten so bad to the point normal porn doesn’t do it for him anymore. He says the thought of having an escort turned him on, but he would never actually play out that fantasy. \n\nI don’t want to be a fool and just ignore the signs. I feel like this looks really bad. \n\nWhat do I do with this information? How do I handle this?

        "text": "\n\nI am 36f, my husband is 36m. We’ve been married for 13 years. Recently my husband had been going through a lot. Early last year his boss, who was his mentor, died in a car accident. Four months later his younger brother, who was only 25, died in his sleep a congenial heart defect that nobody had any idea he had.  My husband took it really badly. He went to therapy (he’s still in it) but there was definitely a lot of stuff that he’s still processing. \n\nObviously our relationship has been affected by this as well. Just a general disconnect, it seemed like there was this growing distance between us. We have been to marriage counseling and one of the things suggested to us to reinvigorate things intimacy wise would be to try out new things. \n\nI took this as doing things like role play, games, etc-things that we have never tried before. That night when we got home and talked about it, the first thing he suggested was a threesome-more specifically a threesome with his late brother’s wife. I was immediately disgusted and told him absolutely not. I was furious that he would even suggest that, and the entire thing felt disgustingly incestuous  to me. \n\nHe then had the audacity to get mad at me. He said that I was shooting down his idea without giving it any thought or consideration. I told him that it didn’t need any thought or consideration because it was disgusting and not happening. He threw a bunch of things our therapist said back to me, about how we’re supposed to be open and listen to each other, he said I was “shaming” him and things like that. He completely didn’t acknowledge why this type of suggestion would make me upset.\n\nThe two of them have always been close, and even more so after his brother’s death. It never bothered me because I always looked at their relationship, and assumed they did too, like a sibling type of relationship. Now I’m questioning all of it. I have not really talked to him since this fight. I don’t know if I can come back from this, I feel disgusted by the entire situation. \n\nWe are in marriage counseling, but due to an upcoming vacation and unavailability on our counselors part our next appointment isn’t until April. \n\nI think what makes this worse for me is that he’s acting righteous because he still thinks I’m the one who did something wrong by shooting down his idea. \n\nI don’t know what to do or say to get him to see my side of this.\n\nTLDR: my husband asked for a threesome with his late brothers wife. I feel disgusted.",

We have 1 kid together and he has 1 kid with another person. I use to think the BM was crazy (from what he would tell me) and now the more I talk to her the more I understand why she left. I’ve told him what he need to work on but it doesn’t seem to bother him. He drinks 24/7 and when he is drinking he’ll get drunk then call me names b***h, c**t, dumb, stupid, etc or tell me to pack my shit and leave if I don’t like it, then in the morning when I try and talk to him about it he’ll say that he didn’t say that. So I told him I wanted to stay the night at my cousins house 23 female because I’m helping plan her wedding and he said wow that’s fucked up then he hung up on me then ignored me when I got home and once I tried to talk to him he told me to pack up my shit and leave if I didn’t like it, so I did and he didn’t reach out to me all day and then later that day he said I broke his heart because he loves me so much and doesn’t want a broken family and said he didn’t tell me to pack my shit but I had it on video then he said that I was wanting a fight since i recorded it. I explained no I just knew you’d tell me you didn’t say that unless I had evidence. He had slowed down on his drinking, and stopped the name calling and started finally helping me with OUR daughter. Now he is drinking heavily again and  got drunk last night at a fundraiser I had to drive home with the 2 kids then kept saying that we’re drifting apart and he doesn’t understand why but when I bring up his drinking he just says he doesn’t see anything wrong with it, it’s how he “relaxes” but he has already threatened to take my car since I’m just a co-signer on it and he’s the main worker in the house I work 3 days a week so I can be with our daughter then remainder of the time I just need some advice to see if I’m over reacting or if it’s something that I need to remove both me and my daughter from. Thanks\n\nTl;Dr my husband is verbally abusive when he’s drunk he drinks 6/12 beers a night doesn’t help with our daughter told me to pack my shit so I did then said I broke his heart I am now back at the house and he’s doing the same thing after he said he’d change need advice should I divorce threaten to take my car I’m a co-signer",

        "text": "Backstory - I havent had feelings for anyone in like 8 years, my last GF was a 7 year relationship and it's been a year since then and I just havent met anyone I really cared for.\n\n2 months ago met someone super cool, talked first for a month then finally got together - I got a crush on day one. She said the same about me, asked me to be her girlfriend on our second date. Said we had the best sex ever and I was the only one to ever make her orgasm. We only hung out like 4 times during the month or so we were together because she has kids and we live an hour apart. \n\nOn our third date night, she blew me off for a few hours, going into the time we were supposed to have met, then when I called to see if she was alright, her friend picked up saying she got day drunk and couldnt function. I was obviously pissed, as we only have one date night a week, that we had planned for a week in advance, and it seemed like she didnt care. She gaslighted me and told me I was crazy, said she's blocking me, then ten minutes later told me to come see her at her parents house. I go, meet them (they were super cool actually), and when we're fudging later she drops the L bomb on me, says she promises she'll never leave, buys a thousand dollar concert tickets 3 months in advance to make up our fight to me. \n\nObviously I was so infatuated and we had like literally everything in common so I ignored these as red flags. 2 days after that night where she told me she's in love with me, I wake up to a \"i dont know if im ready for this\" text. Starts saying how she needs to take care of her kids and suddenly realized that the hour drive between us was too much. Yea, she tells me she loves me then breaks up with me over text 2 days later from a relationship that was her idea. Next day I tell her I'll give her space to figure out what she wants, and she comes over later that week to see if she wants to start over and go slower. She says lets start over. That was the last night I saw her, going on 2 weeks ago now.\n\nEverything seems fine for the next week, we text a lot but with less flirting, which was the idea I thought. We make plans for our weekly date night, and 2 nights before it was supposed to happen, she totally ghosts me for a night. The next morning I text her half-jokingly asking how her date was. She blows up at me, giving me all sorts of insults, says shes glad we're ending for real this time, and blocks me. Ok lol.\n\nLater that night, she unblocks me, insults me a bunch more, then randomly breaks down and says shes actually crying because she thought we'd make it work but she had fucked some random from tinder on the night she ignored me. So I knew what she was doing and again she gaslighted me into thinking I was a crazy person. She then shifts into telling me she still loves me, wishes we'd work, I was the best person she'd ever met, how even though we only dated for like a month it was the best month ever, she'll regret it forever, and that she loves me more than anything. Then blocks me again because \"it wouldnt be fair to you if i text you again and I know i will if I dont just block and delete you\"\n\nHavent heard from her since, going on a week now. Since I noticed myself that I have my own glaring issues I need to work on in developing relationships, and because of the emotional fucking rollercoaster this chick took me on, I started watching and reading tons of self help videos and books. Im starting to realize where I messed up and obviously where she needs to seek her own fucking therapy. In either case, about an hour ago I wrote a short message to her on facebook telling her about going to therapy, how im learning about our issues, and that if she ever grows out of this weird shit she's in right now, i could be open to talk. wished her well, and that was it.\n\nnever going to send her anything else but even though she's obviously kind of crazy, we did really have a ton of shit in common, we were really compatible and attracted to each other, if only she'd figure her shit out... and meeting her family and seeing them happy together made me realize that deep down she knows how to have a happy family, which is what ive always wanted. so even though we only dated for a month, it's led me to feeling the most heartbroken ive ever been. i saw a bright future and the rug got pulled out from under me, especially in the way she did.\n\nin any case my question finally is is there even a point to wonder about this? my logical side is telling me to fucking cringe and run away, but my idiotic in-love side still sees that future with the person thats in there from our first 2 dates if she would just figure her life out.\n\nTl;dr: first girl ive had feelings for and saw a future with in forever turned out to be batshit crazy and i know i should run away forever but i sent her a reconciliation text because im an idiot",

I don’t currently have any, but I’m in uni and often meet people with similar interests in my courses. \n\nI asked if he meant he wouldn’t want me having a ‘boy best friend’ and that obviously I’d let any guy friend know I was in a relationship, wouldn’t hang out with them at night or in private or anything. My train of thought was that I don’t know anyone with the same literature or art taste (both passions of mine) so if I met someone like that I’d hate to turn down a friendship because of their gender.\n\nI can tell he was a bit embarrassed at the request, he wasn’t acting entitled or anything and ultimately said ‘it’s your choice, I’d just prefer you not to’ in a sort of weird tone which sounded reasonable. \n\nIt’s just the more I think about it the weirder I feel. I’m probably the most loyal person I know, as in i’d sooner die than cheat because it so fundamentally goes against my moral code. But I can’t help feel like this rule just means at his core he doesn’t trust me. Even if people are like ‘he trusts you he just doesn’t trust other guys..’ it takes two to tango ya know? If a guy did want to be more than friends, I’d cease all contact. \n\nI love this man very much and I would give up the possibility of any male friend for him, I’m just wondering if this is a common or reasonable standard. Could anyone could shed some light on why a guy would want this that doesn’t stem from distrust in his partner? \n\nTL;DR: boyfriend says he never wants me to have male friends and I’m a bit confused at why’d he’d say this when he apparently trusts me",

        "text": "So I understand that I am absolutely in the wrong in this situation, I just want to know how to go about things properly and cause the least hurt. \n\nI dated my ex (22F) last year for a couple of months. I had slept with my friend (19F) before that but wasn’t doing it at that time, and didn’t do it at all during our relationship. However, everything was new and fresh and my ex asked if I had ever done anything with this friend and I freaked out and said I hadn’t. I lied. And it was stupid. And this became a big mess after this as she found out from a mutual friend that I had previously slept with this friend. I reassured her that nothing was going on but eventually the relationship turned sour and we broke up. She also did and said some pretty shitty things to me but those are irrelevant here. The same week this ex kissed my other ex’s best friend, the girl my friend (that I slept with) liked, and her guy best friend. She then went on to date someone new within a week or two of us breaking up. I was torn up about it because I really liked her and I hated that I ruined things. I went out to get drunk and forget about it, and I ended up being really really drunk before we even got to the club. I was at the club with the friend who I’d previously slept with along with other friends, and a girl came up and asked if the two of us wanted a threesome. I was very hesitant and didn’t really want to but my friend convinced me to do it. I regretted it massively after, and felt really bad about it. However for the next while myself and this friend continued to sleep together, I don’t know why I did it I just felt that this was someone comfortable I could do it with while I was hurting. It only lasted a few weeks after the breakup and has since ended. We are genuinely just friends now completely and I have absolutely no intention of anything happening with her again. \n\nThe issue now is that another one of my friends (22M) is sleeping with this ex. This ex and I are on okay terms and she works at the nightclub I go to weekly, and have a lot of friends at. So I’m worried that he might tell her about it, as he knows. She told everyone I cheated on her after we broke up (I didn’t), and I know she will definitely do so again, even though we’ve been broken up around 8 months now.\n\nI know it’s what I deserve because it was a terrible thing that I did after my ex had experienced so much insecurity about it and seemingly she was right, even though I never cheated and never would. \n\nBut I just want to know, should I be honest and tell her before she finds out, or should I just leave it and let things pan out?\n\nTL;DR: I slept with my friend after my ex and I broke up, even though this was someone she was insecure about while we were dating. She might find out now and I don’t know how to navigate the situation.",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI and my better half have been living together for a bit over 3 years, but I had to move to another city recently for a better job opportunity. Now, this separation is just a temporary thing until she manages to find a job here and move in with me, but it kinda left an impact on our sexual life. To avoid it going dull, we decided to explore new opportunities, and since I know she’s been into mobile games lately, I thought it might be a good idea to find one with a bit of spice.\n\nI know this request may sound unusual, but believe me when I say everything I've tried so far to spice up things a little has been in vain, and this is just another attempt to keep the ball rolling until we're back to living together.\n\nAlso, keep in mind we’re both quite open to trying new stuff, so virtually nothing’s off the charts when it comes to spicy games with good stories :)  \n\n\n TL;DR: My sex life became a little dull and I'm looking for a mobile game to spice things up",

        "text": "\nHello, I don’t really know what will happen here- but we will see. \n\nSo, for this to make sense I have to go back a little bit in time. \nIn 2018 I started in a new school (together with old classmates and stuff) and pretty quickly me and my 2 friends from the old school got together with 5 others who used to hang out a lot (all F in same age) Fast forward 1.5-2 years and one of my friends (i will call her A) got together with a guy (I will call him B) and our friend group made some modifications I guess you could say and we turned into a 5F and 3M group (still same age). We had really great times and  A and B were really great together. They were together for a little over a year until they broke up, (spring/summer 2021). A moved on really fast and after just a few weeks she had a girlfriend. B, on the other hand felt really bad for a while \nand he was not his usual, happy, self. Our friend group broke apart into 2. A with 1 friend, and B with one other, and then the rest of us (4 people)have kind of hanged in the middle and still are friends with both A and B. Although I have grown a lot closer with B and he’s become my best friend, and possibly more than that. \n\nSo, now to the problem/question;\nLike I said, I’ve grown really close with B and he’s my best friend. I’ve been through some really tough things these last months and he’s really been my rock and helped me through everything and always been there and helped me the best he can. At first it really just was a really good friendship and the current friend group we’re in are very close to each other, but for some reason we’ve just grown closer to each other. After a little while we just started to really connect and hang out more and got closer, both emotionally and physically. Then, at the beginning of this year he started to like kiss me on my head and forehead and stuff and we had these moments that I at the moment didn’t think about, but afterwards I’ve realized that it was really flirtatious. Everyone around us thinks or have thought that we were together and we just laughed it off and told everyone that we would NEVER become more than friends and so on.. But I started to feel like it was something more between us.\n\nThen, a few weeks ago, we kissed. And then a few days later we had sex. And we’ve done it multiple times. And it’s really been great. He’s been so kind and always asks if everything is ok and checks up on me and never does anything without my consent. \n\nand I really think that I’ve fallen in love with him. But I was and still am too scared to ask or say anything, because what if he doesn’t want a romantic relationship with me? I don’t want to lose him. He’s the most important person in my life and he literally saved my life. If I loose him and our relationship I will loose myself. \n\nAnd are we even “allowed” to be together? I mean, I’m still good friends with his ex (A) and I don’t want to hurt her, or loose any other friends. \n\nI don’t really know what happened in this post, but if you’ve read this far I’m impressed and really thankful &lt;3\n\nTL;DR - so, one of my close friends’ ex, has become my best friend, and our relationship has grown into something bigger- I’ve fallen in love with him and don’t know what to do. I don’t want to loose any friends and I’m scared that he doesn’t feel the same for me.",
