Not Dailymotion, not Twitter, not nowhere, and especially not on Youtube. Driven by curiosity, I did find my way to it on an obscure Russian site. But it made me wonder WHY the video was seemingly erased from any platform. What happened for it to be this way? Did something happen to the little girl in the video? Or was it just a problem of rights I wouldn't understand crack about? I didn't find anything on the subject given how it was already hard to find the original video. And I wanted to know if any of you have an idea about why it came to this.\nSo... any ideas?",

        "text": "I am currently working on my thesis research project for my music program, and one of the key topics I am trying to convey is the tradition of improvisation in American music. At least, I had been under the impression that was the case. Obviously there is jazz, which is famous for its improvisation. However, I always thought that old-timey music would have included improvisation too, and that live performances in places like Appalachia would include solos and improvisational sections. However, I cannot find much research that explicitly backs this up. I’ve found documents talking about Bill Monroe having “flowing melodic guitar runs” which kind of sounds like it might be improvisation, but I am not sure. I’ve found similar commentary on other musicians as well, such as George Riley Puckett having “adventurous guitar runs.” Is there a tradition of improvisation in American music? Or was I mistaken to think there was? Were these “guitar runs” improvised? What would have improvisation looked like back in the day? Any info on the history of including improvisation in American music would be greatly appreciated.",
