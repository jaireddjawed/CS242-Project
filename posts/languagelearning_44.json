        "text": "So I started doing vocabulary lists with a book I bought which contained the 2500 most common Greek words (my TL). \n\nIt was going pretty well, I was learning 30 words per day. I was reading the book which is pretty much a big list in order of 1 (most used word) to the 2500th word. I was taking notes of the words I didn't know. I'd write the greek word in one side of a paper, and in the other side the translation and next to it words that are somehow related (e.g. μαθητής    student     &lt; καθηγητής (professor)). I'd bend the paper in half hiding the greek word in a way I only saw the translation and then I'd memorize it. It went so fucking well that I learned 200 words in 1 week and later on I did a huge test and I remembered 182 of those 200. Then something funny happened. I realized that in some papers that I wrote them kinda distracted, like in days I was tired, I'd remember the greek word when I saw the english translation but when I looked at the greek word and tried to remember the english translation I couldn't. That didn't happened with papers  that I was studying with more focus but it happened with  papers that I wrote when I was tired or something, with like 1/4 of the words, which is a lot, considering I was doing 30 words per paper and 1 paper a day. Anyway, just thought it would be cool to share this experience. Sometimes you think you're learning but you are just purely memorizing and making no connections or assimilations at all, so in days you're very tired it's maybe better to just rest and leave it to the next day. I really like this method and it's working pretty well for me, but you have to make sure to actually pay attention on what you're doing and make the highest amount of associations and assimilations as possible to make sure the word fixates and never leave your memory, otherwise you just wasted your time.

But, even though I've grown up speaking both languages, they *feel* different to me - I have a notably easier time expressing my feelings in one language, talking in public, etc. There are also skills I've learned in English that I struggle with performing when functioning in Portuguese - like teaching someone how to bake, which is a skill I learned from other English speakers. \n\nRecently I've met a romantic partner and we communicate mostly in Portuguese. My last relationships were with English speakers. I've noticed I have a hard time with talking about my feelings or even talking about specific things without switching languages. \n\nI wondered if anyone has gone through the same and if they've found a solution to this problem. It'd also be interesting to know if there's a scientific/linguistic explanation for this.\n\n(I'm a Linguistics major and have asked professors questions similar to this one and not one of them said they've experienced the same.

I've read a lot about study plans, so more looking for feedback from people who have gone into deep immersion to learn and can comment on some pitfalls (i.e., feeling burnt out, etc.).\n\n**Background:** Studied Portuguese for \\~1 year with apps / books / group class / talking to my native SO. This was back in 2019-2020 and I fell off because of COVID / my job getting way too busy. I would still say I have some of the basics, but more vocab and basic phrases and not a very solid conversational ability. Next year, I will be taking time off my job and moving to Sao Paulo with my SOs family for 5-6 months.\n\n**Plan**: \n\n* 1:1 Tutor for 60-90 min M-F\n* Anki flashcards - 20-30 min a day\n* Content consumption: 2-3 hours a day (books, podcasts, shows)\n* Grammar studying - \\~1 hour a day m-f\n* Conversation: constant really, but plan to talk to my SO and her family for 2-3 hours a day in TL at least\n\nGoal: I have no illusions that I will be fluent in 5-6 months, but would like to leave with a conversational ability beyond the basics (i.e., be able to talk to my GFs family in a real conversation like politics)\n\nRequest: For anyone who has done something similar, would love to hear about your experience. Mainly -\n\n* How did you avoid \"burnout\" given that its so much time to be working on your TL\n* Were there any types of studying you felt were more useful in an immersive environment?\n* How much were you able to learn in your TL in 5-6 months?\n* Any general tips to get the most out of the time there?\n\nTYIA for any advice!",

I can usually communicate with ease about almost any topic and understand conversation about any random topic.\n\nRecently, I have begun to learn Arabic because I would like to learn another language and take classes at the university I work at. I am about a month into learning (I already knew the alphabet from learning Aljamiado in my master’s program so I was able to just jump into learning grammar concepts and vocabulary) and have made some good strides learning basic sentence structure. I have been listening to Arabic input such as music and the voice exercises that accompany the learning aids that I am using. \n\nAs I have begun learning Arabic though I have felt that, for some reason, whenever I hear Spanish on social media or just in passing conversations as I am walking around my home town, it is more difficult than usual to understand things. I am having to really listen to the input instead of just passively listening like I am used to and my brain feels like it’s working way harder than is necessary to understand Spanish right now. \n\nHave y’all ever found that your L2 suffers a little bit when starting an L3? Is this normal? Admittedly, I have been focusing on Arabic pretty heavy as of late instead of Spanish, so maybe it’s just a little bit of fatigue from that, but have any of you ever experienced this before? In order to remedy this, should I just increase my intake of Spanish input whenever I am not learning Arabic?",

CDs /MP3s that come with books are not as convenient  \n\\- an app might even offer interactions with native speakers, teachers, etc.  \n\\- it is more effort to sit down with a book than open an app, you can squeeze in using an app into basically any idle time that you have during the day   \n\n\nWhy books might be better:\n\n\\- since it's more effort to sit down with a book, you probably will spend more time per session learning  \n\n\nOther than that I would say that people who own books might just be different people. If you own a book, you mean it. It cost something, in contrast to Duolingo and others. Maybe people who learn with books are just more diligent idk..\n\nWhat are your arguments?",

        "text": "Hi all!\n\nI'm a native English speaker, and have learned Spanish throughout my school years. I've gotten to the point of taking college-level classes in Spanish and being able to complete essays, etc, adequately. (Although I'm sure I never reached the level of a native speaker.)\n\nThat was *years* ago. Now I'm just hanging on to what Spanish I have remaining.\n\nI'm wondering if at this level, it may be helpful to translate a book from Spanish to English for fun. I enjoy reading/writing, so it would be more similar to an actual translation/meaningful rewrite than a word-for-word switcheroo. I tried reading a book in Spanish recently and it was... much more difficult than I remember. Definitely a lot of things to relearn.\n\nBut also... I could be wasting my time by taking on a personal project like this. I also don't want to be doing active harm to my retained Spanish by trying this out poorly. \n\nSo I guess I'm just asking for your advice or opinions on this method of language learning!",

Although I'm not in need to improve my English drastically now, I want to ameliorate my English since I am in the university whose English is the golden standard language. Also since my English is quite bad, you will have fairly hard time reading this post.\n\nEvery time I speak with people, I realize how blatantly useless my English is. This drawback creates the worst chemical reaction with my severe lack of communication skills. So, what happens when I have conversations with people is that conversations will never get expanded to the extent that we can get into details, anyone who Im having conversation with ends up talking like alone since all I can do is to respond to them like \"yeah\", \"I see\" or anything that's meaningless.\n\nAnother problem is that I feel like Im lacking every single aspect of what's considered as necessary abilities of handing language when it comes to English. In my first language, I know how to use medium-level idioms, slangs and how to do writings. There is a lot less uncertainty in the words I use. However, when speaking English, my mind often gets blanked and even I don't know what the hell I am thinking about. Im guessing that what I need to improve is, the scale of my English vocabulary, ability to communicate with other types of English whose other people have gotten, the deep understanding of what each English word exactly means, the ways to connect words together in order to accurately reflect my ideas flowing in my brain. As for the last part, I am concerned that my English is resulting in a blockage between the real intent or idea in my brain, and the English I output.\n\nIt is helpful if you could suggest anything I can do to ameliorate these problems above.\n\nThank you",

I am an Italian living in Australia and lucky to have native speakers in my family, however, they aren't exactly great \"teachers\" so struggle to explain the nuances of grammar, idioms, etc.\"It's just what people say\". So have been finding it quite difficult and have not been getting much out of the experience.\n\nYou might have recently heard about OpenAI releasing [ChatGBT](https://chat.openai.com). It's an incredible (and free) AI chatbot that is great at generating text from various prompts, it can have conversations and maintain context and even recognise its own mistakes. (I would highly recommend you read more about it on their website)... \n\n...but most importantly it's great at speaking, translating and explaining in different languages (100% judgement-free 🤣)\n\nI believe it has the potential to be a fantastic companion for all language learners who, like me, find it daunting to speak with native speakers. Chatting with ChatGBT can provide a low-pressure environment where learners can practice their skills and make mistakes without feeling anxious or embarrassed.\n\nAs a starting point, here are some simple prompts I've been playing with to improve my grammar, reading comprehension etc.\n\n* General guidance – \"What's the fastest way to learn Italian\"  \n* Grammar – \"Explain Italian verb conjugation\"\n* Reading – \"Write a short story in Italian about a small black dog who lives on the beach in Italy\"\n* Translation – \"Please translate the following into English and explain its meaning\"\n* Conversation – \"Hi, can you please ask me 3 personal questions in Italian, review my answers and give feedback on how correct the grammar of my responses are\"\n\nIt could generate translation exercises, fill-in-the-blank exercises, and conversation prompts to help learners practice their reading, writing, and speaking skills.\n\nIt can provide feedback and guidance on learners' progress. For example, by providing feedback on learners' writing samples or conversation transcripts, highlighting any mistakes and offering suggestions for improvement.\n\nI'm so excited to see all of the implications of what this tool can do for us, next to or instead of Duolingo, iTalki, Tandem, Anki and various other traditional learning methods. \n\nIs anyone else using it for language learning already? If you have any good prompt recommendations I would absolutely love to hear them!\n\nLastly, if you're interested, I've published some [generated short stories in Italian here](https://linguatips.super.site/short-stories). They are very cute.\n\nHope this is helpful!",

        "text": "In the past year, and especially recently, I've been spending my time learning Spanish on Duolingo. I've found Duolingo a very nice tool to get the grammar down, especially because the Spanish course is very complete, but apart from grammar, Duolingo is very slow in expanding my vocabulary. I am almost learning about past tense, and from that point I am slowly considering using a different tool for vocab, but I don't want to ruin my experience in Duolingo. \n\nSo my question is, when should I look for other tools for particularly vocabulary? And what tools do you suggest? \n\nI have a Spanish speaking girlfriend so I can practice speaking anytime, and with that in mind, tools like HelloTalk might not be so interesting. I can also just stick to Duolingo of course; like I said, the course is quite complete/long these days anf will probably get me to A2/beginner B1 level. However, that takes a long time.

If you choose to translate the content it automatically translates into English, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Serbian. I'm going to add functionality so you can choose which languages to translate to but need a bit of time to finish that.\n\nOnly limit is that the upload has to be less than 300MB and one hour or less in duration. I follow Dr. Stephen Krashen's method for language learning which is comprehensible and compelling input, with this approach and the ability to turn any content you find into something you can learn from I think it reaches peak levels of compelling and with the ability to have your own language below to easily compare against to learn words you don't know yet I think it immediately makes all content you find 100% comprehensible simultaneously, thus I think this app reaches the peak of giving language learners maximally compelling and maximally comprehensive input.\n\nI've had a lot of success with it in my language learning so I hope it helps you as well! The code is all open-sourced too if you want to run your own version: [https://github.com/mayeaux/generate-subtitles](https://github.com/mayeaux/generate-subtitles). Cheers!",

        "text": "In the Russian learning subreddit there's learners of Russian who ask for places to go for Russian immersion, and theu get answers like 'go to Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Georgia, Uzbekistan etc' if you can't go to Russia. I think that's kinda problematic, both practically and morally - practically you might not get the full immersion you want, and morally it's iffy for other reasons. \n\nAnd if you're a native Russian speaker who is living in Georgia or Uzbekistan and plan to stay there for longer than say...six months, for example, I sympathise, but I'd recommend you actually learn Georgian and Uzbek, even if you can do practically everything you need only in Russian.\n\nAnyway, that's not my point. The point is that, if you should learn Dutch if you live in the Netherlands, you should also learn Frisian if you live in Friesland, right? If you should learn English to live in Ireland, you should also learn Irish, right? If you should learn Italian in Italy, you should also learn Sardinian if you go live in Sardinia, right? If you should learn French living in France, you should definitely learn Reunion Island Creole in Reunion Island, no? \n\nOr is this only about practicality? If I CAN live in Malta without speaking Maltese, if I CAN live in France without speaking French, if I CAN live in Estonia without speaking Estonian, what's the difference between that and the regional languages I outlined?",

The usability of the language is so much that there's no 'right accent' in English. But do you guys think that learning a particular English accent makes you pretentious or annoying?\n\nI will be soon moving to England for my studies, and I'm just curious about everyone's opinions on it.",
