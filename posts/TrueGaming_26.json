        "text": "In my case, I'll take Saints Row 2, and Bully. Both are different types of open world, but they share certain characteristics that make their own map very good. One of the things they differ in is the size, but both are matched at the detail level of detail. Saints Row 2 has Stilwater, a place that roughly resembles the size of Liberty City, but whose variety of areas and locations give the impression of a larger map than it really is. We have the prison, the nuclear plant, a cultural festival, the neighborhoods, the city, a police station, beaches, hidden islands, neighborhoods and more. We have a large variety of NPCs on each map. In Saints Row 2 we can see many references to the modern American culture (Mimes, employees of fast food companies, street performers, university students, \"Punks\", skaters, etc). \n\nBully has Bullworth, a somewhat short map compared to the scale of other Rockstar games, but very enriched in details, which shares an excellent architecture of areas of the exterior and surroundings, and internal places. And in Bullworth we have a lot of personality, where the world is inhabited by different characters belonging to different factions, who possess their own behavior, attitude and combat style even.\n\nDetails, variety of zones, interestings and unique NPC's in each type, situations that are created thanks to artificial intelligence, easter eggs, and many things to do and collectibles to find, but without losing the charm of being in a world where exploration is something that can be enjoyed, are some things that make a open world map very good for me. Things like seeing how the nerds use projectile weapons in the game and facing off against other fractions in freeroam, or Easter Egg like the Cabit and the secret island in Stilwater, are those kind of things that make the map memorable and alive, and I think I'm being short to describe how well they do it and what so many things can offer.\n\nThere are different types of open world, such as Prototype or Saints Row 4, where, as they are worlds of games with a faster rhythm, the detail is not very necessary since the player can lose them when traveling the map flying or at maximum speed. But games like Saints Row 3 are somewhat disappointing on the map, because while they hide that fact with their missions and activities, when you explore the world, there are only NPCs that are boring, areas that do not have much variety or points of interest that they are not, well, interesting, and a map whose exploration is not so rewarding. \n\nThere are still other good examples, such as Borderlands 2, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, GTA SA, 4 and 5, Sleeping Dogs, and many others. And you? How do you think it should be a map of a good open world game? What game do you take as a good example to follow?",

        "author": "lleti",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8vrrw2/voice_acting_and_its_affects_on_choice_in_games/",
        "text": "Back in the days of yore, voice acting was seen as a more rare commodity in gaming. Outside of small segments/sound bites, full voice acting was once a rarity outside of certain genres.\n\nIn those times though, we were treated with some of the best branching discussion trees we've gotten to see in any games to date. As an example, take a look at Baldur's Gate from 1999, or the older Ultima series titles. Similarly in this vein, we saw early titles that pioneered branching storylines, such as Chrono Trigger - built with hardware that couldn't support full voice acting in its wildest dreams.\n\nNowadays though, with storage space being a very cheap commodity as compared to times past, full voice acting has evolved into an expectation, rather than the novelty it once was. With it however, came a large caveat - branching discussion trees have been slowly eroding. A more modern example would be to take a look at Morrowind - discussion options with every NPC were at a point of bloat, as the only voiced lines were for the most part, only greetings - or story-critical sections. The difference between Morrowind and Oblivion/Skyrim in terms of discussion depth is like night and day, with the advent of fully voiced characters. Similar again, take a look at Fallout 3, as compared to Fallout 4. 3 had fully voiced characters, with a decent amount of branching discussion - but with 4 introducing protagonist voicing (with male/female options supported), branching discussion became more like a clever illusion than actually supporting any depth.\n\nThe reasons behind this are fairly obvious - fully voiced dialogue is now an expectation for many gamers. However, renting studio time, paying for the talent, and paying for subsequent re-takes on lines all costs money. Celebrity voice acting adds to the toll - and if you're avoiding \"pure procedural\" lip-sync ala ME: Andromeda, then your animations team also have to perform some tidy-up work on facial expressions in post. The reality is that for older titles, branching discussion was simply writing the dialogue - cheap. Modern titles, branching discussion comes with a huge overhead in voice acting/animation, for content that the player may never experience. Or, if we were to compare it to older titles with massive discussion trees - content that most players are **not** intended to experience.\n\nI felt like the Mass Effect Trilogy met a moderately happy medium between voice acting, and branching discussion - albeit there was still a decent bit of \"illusion of choice\" work at play. Skyrim fared a little better than Oblivion, in that you could at least trigger some unique/quest lines from some NPCs. The Witcher 3 set a pretty good bar overall for choice in a fully voiced game, but the reality is that The Witcher 3 is an exception, rather than the rule.\n\nHow do you feel about the modern era of fully-voiced, dialogue-heavy games? \n\nDo you feel like choice has been eroded, or do you think there are any decent examples of games that maintain a lot of choice, while still including heavy amounts of dialogue? And with that - if Bethesda turned around tomorrow (suspension of disbelief, for a moment here..) and stated Fallout5, or TES6 were arriving with way more depth, but going back to text-only roots, how would you feel about it?

        "text": "I Have been playing some rpgs or arpg  (horizon zero dawn, divinity o sin 2, pillars 1 and 2, witcher 123, god of war....) And often they tend to link their stories, and their main characters, to deities, gods,  or epic tales of save the world.\n\nOf course this is a known trope and it is understandable. (Stories archetypes, hero thousand faces....)\n\nNevertheless I had the feeling that these games feel they have to one-up their competitors or themselves. \n\n\" oh yeah in your game the player had to kill a god?..... Well in our new game you ARE a god ! \"\n\nIt really felt cheap to me in the case of divinity original sin 2 (the name of the game is already a big hint I know....) .\n\nI was like \" uh....again with the gods and deities stories....*sigh*\" - with is sad because the local/sub stories of the game are more grounded and you easily connect with them.\n\n**So my question, is it possible to make an engaging GRAND and EPIC stories (which is understandable as a scenario goals) without resorting to ending up facing gods and deities or even make the main character becomes one?**\n\n\nIt seems that god-related stories become the obligatory route for game writers \" well my character destroyed a village, he fought countries, he killed dragons,  well I guess he has to fight gods now\". How original.\n\nAnd these games, by being almost all about facing deities, really cheapens themselves because when you get to a point where you meet/face deities, the story needs to keep going and thus make the gods weak in some ways so they become just another normal challenge, and it goes on, .... oh yeah you killed 3 gods ? Well here are the gods of these gods ! Oh you kill them now ? Well , surprise, here is the Universe Mind Spirit, nothing is above it !! Oh... You kill it .....well.... hum.... I tricked you, there is something above it actually....sigh....\n\nCan grounded stories be epic enough to entertain the player ? Does the abundance of god-related stories bore the player and cheapen it all ? Do most of the AAA rpgs stories really all are about gods/ deities or saving the world ?\n\nI think witcher 3 did a good thing because while there was some hint to gods and deities, it was mainly a low level kind of fight, and the overarching plot was a personal story more or less.

        "text": "What I mean by \"truly\" in the title is a shooter that encompasses the typical classes you'd find in a battlefield-like shooter, where you actually need all the classes and teamwork to win. These classes could include a medic, short range engineer or tactician, medium range grenadier or assault gunner, and a long range sniper or marksman.\n\nThis question is inspired by what I think would be the ideal Battlefield playing scenario, where a small squad plays together to win the match. My justification for this post is that I've never really seen or heard of a competitive shooter like this where the victors are a small squad, and everyone contributed with their own class and abilities. There's PUBG which has a squad mechanic, but no real classes or skills that enable this type of play, as in a game could be won by a lone wolf or a squad with not much of a difficulty jump between the two. Please note that I'm not saying it would be easy to one-man-squad your way through a PUBG tournament, I'm just saying that there is no functionality built-in to provide that traditional squad gameplay.\n\nSo are there any games out there like that? I know R6: Seige is a team-based arena-esque shooter, where often times teams will choose certain operators to help eachother out, and thats probably the closest game to what I'm thinking of.\n\nDo you think we could ever see a squad/team-based shooter where a squad would need to have all their bases covered to win? I think it would be really interesting to watch a really good team play together. A medic knows when to heal the team, and the team knows how to cover the medic and clear a room to get to a downed team member so the medic can revive him. Or a sniper could take overwatch on a nearby bluff while the other members of the squad push into a compound of enemies with his cover fire and spotting from his location. \n\nI'm not really sure at the moment how this could translate into an E-Sports title, but nonetheless by itself would be a very fun game to play.",

        "text": "Greetings, /r/truegaming! Good to see you.\n\nSo, this is a quick topic/rant: I absolutely hate when companies announce a new product, and they shove a \"pre-alpha footage\" in the gameplay trailer. It feels so wrong! \n\nI'm a developer myself, and while this can vary from people to people, I always imagine a pre-alpha build from a game looking like [this](https://i.imgur.com/xeJSC3Z.png) - Bad hud, no textures, ugly models, but the basic mechanics are in place.  \n I understand why games need to show the best graphics possible in their announcements (so people can get excited) but I don't get the \"early pre-alpha footage\" message that usually comes with the trailer - specially when the finished product doesn't look THAT different from the announcement (and sometimes, it looks worse). Its just arrogant.\n\nDo you know any games that had truly pre-alpha announcements as gameplay? \nThe new [Beyond Good and Evil 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjrzemJvUCU) looks like a very polished beta, and I like that - No scripted sequence, no nothing, just a dude flying his monkey.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I really dislike the unnecessary messages saying that the game is in alpha or beta footage. If the game looks better or worse in its finished state, we'll notice, with or without the message, so...\n\nSee you guys!\n\n",

        "text": "I don't have much of an opinion either way on Quantic games.  I've only played Heavy Rain and it was ok.\n\n\nLately whilst looking at reviews for Detroit, I've come across several articles / youtube videos trashing David Cage's writing and how terrible he is.\n\n\nThis makes me curious.  With such terrible writing, how does Quantic and Cage keep getting the AAA money to do what they do, and with barely any competition in this genre?  Writers are not hard to come by, why hasn't anyone come along and out-Caged Cage?  Or even pressure from Sony on Quantic to replace Cage as a writer?\n\n\nIs it because Quantic's engine technology gives them the advantage?  (And Cage, being a founder, gets to hog the limelight?)  Is it because, for all his flaws, Cage is pushing the envelope in nonlinear storytelling, and most other writers aren't participating in this space?\n\n\nIn purely story based games like Quantic's, story is everything.  And you can't even accuse their games of being terrible to pander to the mass market, like some of the dumber films that come out of Hollywood.  So why does Quantic stay popular enough to keep getting funded?\n\n\nWhy hasn't someone copied or licensed their engine, and then actually have good writing?",

        "text": "RPGs are, in theory, the most interesting type of game because they promise a sense of wonder, liberty and agency.\n\nHaving played, mostly RPGs, I still am annoyed by various game design mechanics that I find heavy, hindering innovation, counter productive to what a RPG should be about (player impact on the game world).\n\nI fully know that most of these mechanics exist because they \"make life simpler for the player\" - it is often the argument when defending seemingly stupid / dumb design choices, and I understand that, I dont want to remove these mechanics just for the sake it and also I understand there need to be a replacement which does not kill the player's fun.\n\n**So, here they are :**\n\n== 1 **- Over abundance of Items: ==**\n\nI have never in my life understood the reasoning behind the existence of the sheer amount loot, namely consumables in RPGs. I am playing Divinity Original Sin 2 right now and sitting with 100s of potions which are just USELESS.\n\nThese items increase player's stats and skills. Ok, thus why arent the challenges designed taking into account these items?  Should the game be harder in order to make the player use these items ? Or should there be less items ?\n\nThe current situation in ALMOST ALL RPGs is that items become useless and have no values in in the eyes of the player. It really cheapens their existence.\n\nBest feeling in game, facing a challenge, and often older zelda games knew how to do it, is to realize that you barely made it.\n\n$$$$ Solutions :   \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\- reduce the number of items : challenge can be calculated in a rational manner (I remember that Ubisoft were the first to think about rational game design, giving values to challenges and to players skills and building the levels around it). So if the difficulty of fight in the cave of the island is value 10, and usually players are around value 8, then make like items available that help the player regarding that gap (a few health potion, a few strength potions....).\n\nThe idea here is that player will be \"happy\" to find a potion.\n\nAlso we can, that way, implement a natural \"max weight\" inventory, because players will in the end use what they carry.\n\n\\- other idea : limited inventory weigh and \"expiration date\" system. that way, players will learn that items should be used. thus they can control the difficulty of the game, instead of a difficulty slider, player will just decide if they want to chug the potions that would make the challenges easier....\n\nDark souls was really smart with their limited health potion.... sadly the game is stupid with the rest of the items which (besides some very specific pvp items) are mostly useless.\n\n== 2 **- Money, Money, Money : ==**\n\nAgain, too much money = money is useless.\n\nI have never seen a game implementing an interesting economy, or even a design system that makes money useful and or interesting \"all\" along the game.\n\n2 reasons :  (1) in almost all the games, loot that you find in the world is always better than loot that you can buy, and (2) money is always just an artificial barrier to events (bribe the guard, by an item) that always are beatable in a normal way (fight, etc...)\n\nSometimes, if we are lucky, some games can have a interesting phase, usually at the first 25&amp;#37; of the game, when money is scarce and loot is rare, thus vendors have items we dream about, and when we finally decide to buy it it is really a good feeling. Sadly this does not last long, vendors become useless quickly in the game.\n\n$$$$ Solutions :   \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nmoney should be its own \"game path\", meaning that with certain character choices in term of leveling (thievery, stealing, barter...) player can opt to \"win the game by being rich\". This would be make them weaker and bad at combat and/or magic.... but the game makes sure that MOST of the challenges can be beaten with money. Money gathering becomes a real path, and thus other types of characters (who can fight and magic better) will be poor and just \"dream\" about these items they could buy.\n\nAgain, the idea here is to make things NEEDED and interesting.\n\n== 3 **- Savescumming and Minmaxing : ==**\n\nI know  this is a unpopular opinion, but I believe that when a \"comfort\" option is available 90&amp;#37; of human beings will take it in some way.\n\nI hate save scumming and minmaxing and i wish game design would just create systems that blocks it. People will tell you \"but if people wanna do it let them, the other can just restrain\". Nope, life that does not work like that.\n\nSadly, when you fail a \"persuasion test\" or if you \"choose the wrong answer\" in a dialog, and you are just one quick load away from passing it.... very very few human beings will just let it go. I think that savescumming should be very hard to execute, or impossible, in order to make the player feel that his decision matter and that consequences are interesting.\n\n(of course i am not talking about game breaking bad decision, like for example \"of you picked the wrong answers ? well that entire city is now blocked and you will never see it in this playthrough...\" - this should not exist or there should always be a way to circumvent it).\n\n$$$$ Solutions :  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\- ideally, saves should be automatic and permanent (just like dark souls).\n\n\\- also ideally, stats should be hidden to the players in order to keep him away from \"minmaxxing\" and just enjoying the show. like you could know that you are building a \"strength\" character but you cant know if you have 20 or 21 strength.\n\n\\- dialog checks or skill checks should not block off entire areas of the game, but just drive the different players into a different experience : you get to city a, you have a dialog check with the head of the police, (1) you pass persuasion test, you can enter and navigate as a normal citizen (2) you almost  fail, you can enter but police will harass you - but this opens up dialogs with the poor citizens (3) you fully fail, you must enter threw sewers and the police will actively try to arrest you, but this opens up dialogs with the low lifes and criminals.\n\nthe biggest isssue i realized with savescumming (or actually quest systems in general) is that player have the FEAR OF MISSING OUT. which is understanble. \" i payed for this game, if i fail that dialog/skill check, then i get less content... but i payed for it?\".\n\nThus, game design should make sure that content is always accessible even tho from a different perspective (see example of city above).\n\nthanks a lot ! hope we have a good discussion",

        "text": "9 hours into Elex, I broke down and started duping items. Why? Because walking around unable to kill basic enemies is extremely frustrating. Elex isn't the only perpetrator in this matter. Off the top of my head, the other experience i began to dread in a similar time frame was Xenoblade Chronicles X.\n\nThere is a sense of enchantment about having the planet come to life and butcher you, but it's a fleeting high. In Elex in particular, I didn't distribute my early stats correctly and got flat out punished for it by not being able to equip more than the T0 trash weapon that you can use with no stat modifications. Xenoblade X is guilty of having any number of goliath monsters just hiding around waiting to frag you. There's even one boss that renders at as background setting and then when you get too close triggers as a monster,. and likely butchers you, because the mission that sends you there does so at an extremely early level. \n\n\nI can't help but feel this type of setting does nothing but encourage degenerate game play. Also, let's not confuse this for \"Difficulty\" it's not difficult to determine you can't win a fight, and then run away. Similarly it's not difficult to cheese enemies by ranging them down 1 damage at a time for an extremely pitiful reward of 10xp and a couple pieces of vendor trash. Hell beyond the scope of the starting areas in Elex, I spent the first 3 hours hugging cliffs and using jump jets to get around avoiding aggro. That's not entertaining, especially when the jump jet mechanic has no upgrades and the alternative is to just flat out die.\n\n\nSo, what needs to change?\n\nI believe personally, that if they're going to continue to make games like this, they ought to just embrace the enemy evasion mechanics, and give you a suitable tool set to work with that isn't extremely frustrating. The jump jets shouldn't have an infinite flight limit, but they shouldn't have a fuel gauge either. Players should be able to jump and evade enemy encounters easily, until the elect to engage the mob. OR make a few more rare enemy spawns that will kill an unsuspecting player and leave most enemies manageable from the get go. This takes away from the allure of the verdant world, but really the current status quo isn't suitable. These aren't games. They're lessons in masochism.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8v1wen/a_discussion_about_the_2019_pokemon_game/",
        "text": "So, a mainline Pokemon game on a home console. Pretty amazing right? I know it's old news but I've been really want to talk about that for a long time. Now, there are two main things I've been wanting to have a proper discussion on. How well the community will take it and it being \"open-world\". \n\nAlright so, to start with. I am really worried about how the community would handle the new Pokemon game. While I do know that the Pokemon community has always been a fickle community, with a mainline Pokemon game on the Switch it would even extremely hard to raise good opinions. Why? It's Pokemon on a Switch! For the first time a Pokemon mainline game will be out on a home console. Yes, I know that the Switch isn't the most powerful system out there but it's loads stronger in comparison to \"mobile consoles\". The hype-train is steaming at breakthrough speed. There's no need for hardware constraints anymore, online features should be way better, think of all the things they could accomplish! \n\nThe new Pokemon game would need to somehow meet this demand. However, here's a problem. Change too much and people would be angry, change too little and people wouldn't be satisfied. Gamefreak would need to somehow precisely hit the mark where both sides would be happy. Speaking of which, what new mechanics could they add in? One suggestion that I've seen pop up is that they could possibly make it like a MMO. Besides from that, what else? Another suggestion that I often see pop up often is that they should make it open-world, more specifically BotW open world. However this is one my greatest gripes, how exactly do you make it like BotW openworld?\n\nThing is, Pokemon in my eyes has always been pretty open-world. Now it wasn't particularly open-world as modern examples of the genre but it did definitely have elements of it. For example, you were free to progress at your own rate and there were multiple things you could do besides from the core gameplay. For example, you could spend time in a casino or simply go wander a safari. When people say that they would want the new Pokemon game to be open-world like BotW, I have no idea what they mean. How exactly does BotW and Pokemon mix? I just don't get it. I think people are confused with a game being \"open-world\" and a game having \"non-linear progression\". \n\nTo explain what I mean by \"non-linear progression\", it's quite simple. Instead of having only one way to complete something, you have multiple ways to do so. Fallout New Vegas is an excellent example of this. Now I don't want to spoil stuff but lets just say that there are plenty of interesting ways to complete a quest, and they can have different outcomes. I think what people are really wanting for isn't Pokemon being open-world, rather it's for Pokemon to have \"non-linear progression\". Lets use an example. Instead of say, you  just needing to defeat a gym leader to acquire HM rock smash to travel to a new area and you could either:\n\n* Get a Pokemon to cut down a tree and then float down on the tree, having to battle several trainers on the way.\n\n* Fight and capture a rare Pokemon that has already known a surf by default then surf down that very same river.\n\n* Travel back to an already unlocked area and defeat a specific trainer which will destroy the \"rocks\", allowing you to pass.\n\n* Pay for a shortcut which instead of taking you to the specified area, it leads you to a totally different area. \n\nNow in all of these you don't need all of them to lead to one specific area. Each could lead to multiple and different locations. This would fulfill the idea of Pokemon being open world and also sorta nails that \"BotW Pokemon\" matchup that people have been asking for. Anyways, these are my opinions on the new Pokemon mainline game. I would be very glad to hear your response to this.\n",

It shows who was the fastest, and who got crushed by items on specific laps. I'd also love them to expand on the idea and show how many items and which items players were shot by on each lap. It would be funny to see a players lap times killing it coming first, and then to see a poor final lap with a whole bunch of Blue turtle shell, red shell, lightning icons next to their time. It's something that creates banter between players during coop and I use to enjoy seeing it when playing every other Mario Kart. I'm really confused as to why they removed this feature. ",

        "text": "I've noticed a pattern of many games with balanced and diverse meta building off of a central rock, paper, scissors set of advantages.  Let me give some examples:\n\nFire Emblem - Swords beat axes beat spears beat swords\n\nPokemon - Every element fits into a big rps model but you can boil the core down to the classic fire/water/grass.\n\nSoul Calibur - Horizontal attacks are countered with ducking/jumping or guarding, vertical/thrust attacks are countered with sidestepping, and guards are countered with unblockables and throws.\n\nStarcraft - Concussive damage is more effective against small units, explosive damage is more effective against large units, and normal damage is equally effective but often outputs lower base damage.  Also the core macros of offense vs expansion vs tech up.\n\nHalo - Gun, grenade, melee\n\nDark Souls - Attacks are defeated by blocking, blocking is defeated by guard break (kick in ds1, bitchslap in ds2 etc), guard break is vulnerable to attacks.\n\nThese games layer plenty of complexity on top but I get the sense that when the ideas were in their infancy, the designers were starting off with this very simple core model, tuning it, and then building on top of it.  It seems to very often lead to a lot of tactical depth in gameplay.\n\nWhat other games appear to be built from similar models? Are there games which attempted to use this and fell flat? Why?",

        "text": "Do you give it an hour? Two hours? Does it depend on the game? If the game doesnt pull you in immediately, do you set it down?\n\nLike many of you I have an ever increasing backlog of games. Because I have so many experiences at my fingertips, it makes the decision to give up on a game rather difficult. This problem is further compounded when I happen to be playing a critically acclaimed title and it just doesn't click.\n\nA perfect example of this deals with **Nier Automata**. On paper, Nier seems like the perfect game for me. Hack and slash is my favorite genre, I adore platinum games, and I love stories about artificial intelligence. These factors are coupled with the overwhelming positive reception the game garnered. \n\nDespite all this, after a couple hours I just could not get into the game. I found the combat subpar and the overall game design kind of clunky. What I would end up doing is playing for 30-45 minutes, get bored, and then decide to play something else. This happened maybe 3-4 times until today where I told myself that I would force myself to play the game for 2 hours. I decided to give up on after Nier 1.5 hours. I just could not get into it.\n\nGiving up on a game really sucks, especially when you want to experience the same kind of joy everyone else seems to be feeling. I think the hardest part is that sometimes you never really know if and when to stop. There have been occasions where I have forced myself to play a game, only to end up loving it. \n\nAnyways, I want to know how you are able to tackle this issue.",

And still, after years of the games' existence and still having some knowledge of the general plot, I was able to be terrified of every jump scare and suspenseful corner in the game. I'm talking particularly about Resident Evil Remastered. Even as a relative casual to the series, it seems like an absolute timeless classic horror game.\nAnd I need to ask, does anybody else feel this way? Perhaps about some other old horror games.

I played the first fallout and tried to play what seemed like a \"fun\" playstyle using unarmed combat but the RNG and random encounters proved too much and I usually died without doing much damage so I just hung the game and played stuff that was more noob friendly.

I'm mostly looking for gems that I might have missed or backward compatible games that I've never played before. I'm exclusively a console gamer, so please keep that in mind with recommendations, but I do have both an Xbox One and PS4 (and a switch).\n\n**Things/games that I like:** I love single player, and story driven games. These most frequently include RPGs and action-adventure games. Some of my favorites include: the Mass Effect series (and pretty much anything by Bioware - ME:A), Witcher 3, Skyrim, Persona 5, TLOU. Games with great game play, strong/interesting character development, or rich narratives also hook me, such as Bioshock, Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted (4, especially), Tomb Raider, Dishonored, and the new God of War. I'll also happily sit through narrative games if the story pay off is good, such as Life is Strange, Oxenfree, or Firewatch. \n\n**Things I don't like...as much:** Honestly, I think of myself as a pretty open person with gaming, but shy away from multiple player games, or games without any story elements. Bad voice acting is also a buzz kill, but I can usually overlook it for a good story. I feel the same about linear narratives. I can often overlook a lack of player choice if the main story is good (this is why Horizon Zero Dawn sort of bugged me, but I digress.) And I'm pretty tolerant of outdated graphics...so that's not a big deal. For whatever reason, I've never been able to get through any of the Dark Souls games. I just lose interest. \n\nSo what have a missed? I had a big break in my gaming history and didn't do much between 2004 and 2010. There are particular games that interest me (looking at you, Alpha Protocol) that aren't back compatible yet, so I haven't picked them up. Some things I'm considering are Divinity: Original Sin, Fallout: New Vegas (never played it), and Vampyr. Any recommendations are welcome though, especially for RPGs or story driven games. Thanks! ",

        "text": "This is a repost from r/gamesociety because I was unaware of this sub being a place for discussion.\n\nI wrote this as a rough piece on Capcom, inspired by Devil May Cry 5. I intend to make a proper article or video series about it once finished but I thought it might be fun to share the first part before I go any further. The main point is illustrated in this part, while I intend to go in depth on each individual series one by one later, with Megaman as a whole the focus this time.\n\nThere was a time in my life when Capcom was a mark of difficult but amazing games. \n\nThey might just be able to stand against Nintendo for most memorable franchises by a single developer of my childhood.\n\nSony and Microsoft had plenty of their own hit franchises but not in the way these two giants did. They have 3rd party exclusives but few in-house classics. Nintendo has Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Star Fox ect. \n\nCapcom never made their own console but has a lineup that stands tall against the all star cast of Nintendo (though many were from the arcade cabinet days and were designed with this in mind).\n\nGhosts and Goblins, Street Fighter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Onimusha etc. All legendary in their own right. \n\nIt also interested me how they would evolve their franchises. Megaman was dated and rather bare bones by the time 6 released. So rather than make a sequel that was a drastic departure they made a sequel series that drew on both the story and gameplay to make a larger scale, complex platformer in Megaman X. \n\nIt had more complex levels, a new and advanced look to fit the story, advanced mechanics and extras like the armor capsules and Hadouken.\n\nSmart design had the game teach you the mechanics yourself through the first level with the new multi level charge shot and wall jumps. Others have covered this in depth so I will move on.\n\nAs time went on Megaman X started flagging as a property and the decision was made to return to an old idea for the first.\n\nThe character of Zero, beloved by fans for his long hair, red armor and signature Z saber, was intended to be the protagonist of X. It was decided that his design (which lacked his Z saber at the time) was too drastic a change and so the character of X was created and the story as we know it happened. \n\nThe decision was made to give Zero his own series after being the playable dueteragonist for several games, which had each refined his play style.\n\nSo we got Megaman Zero for GBA. A return to the punishing difficulty of the classic Era,¬† while being a streamlined and faster paced successor to X. It again built upon the story and world by way of a time skip which serves as an easy explanation for the art shift.\n\nUnlike the previous series though, Zero was given a definitive ending. It was ambiguous as to the outcome but it was the definitive end. \n\nSo they decided to reinvent the wheel one more time. Enter Megaman ZX.\n\nIt drew heavily on the style and gameplay of the Zero series but the early game was a deliberate throwback to the X series. Leading to the fusion of both protagonists in a form that ultimately just felt like Zero. So they decided to one up X by allowing you to take on a hybrid form as well as abilities of your enemies. The sequel threw in a throwback to Axl, the tritagonist of the later X games. The story also advanced to match the new gameplay mechanics and blurred the lines between human and machine, something that had been a theme since classic. \n\nThen we get to the spin offs. Rather than just slap a character into a spin off so it will sell like Mario or Sonic, Capcom decided to build entire stories around alternate versions of the character. For a company that doesn't care much about plot I have to commend how much world building went into every Megaman series. The classic to ZX line built on each other while Legends and Battle Network took a different route, both of which had much more fleshed out characters and worlds. \n\nBoth would eventually be turned into full series of their own, with Battle Network leading into Star Force similar to the transition from Classic to X. While Legends unfortunately died after its second entry, in spite of attempts to bring it back for 3.\n\nRather than drive the series into the ground the continually tried to reinvent it, with the story being reinvented to match. We never got all the answers but speculation is often more satisfying than the real answers once revealed. \n\nAnother series was reinvented even further. Resident Evil and its children Onimusha and Devil May Cry.",

        "text": "In my estimation, DLC can be extremely hit and miss, with far more failures than successes. Despite this, there are some times where dlc is so well made that it is just as good, if not better than the main game. Here are some examples that come to mind \n\n**The Borderlands 2 DLC Suite**: To me, every borderlands game has had great dlc, with BL2 having the best suite of the series. The clear standout is Tiny Tina's D&amp;D inspired chapter, but all pieces of DLC are pretty great. I think BL2s DLC works because it plays off the strength of the game by doubling down on enemy variety and showing the prowess of the artstyle.\n\n**Minerva's Den - Bioshock 2**: To me, this is the greatest piece of DLC ever made. A sort of mini-campaign, this dlc puts you in the shoes of an entirely new character. Although Bioshock 2 is one of my favorite games of all time, Minerva's Den outshines it in nearly every aspect. It has a tighter more interesting story, more challenging gameplay, and more interesting level design. On top of that many new mechanics are added to tweak the formula just enough to feel fresh.\n\n**Mass Effect 3's DLC Suite**: I think ME3's dlc is the best example I can think of where a DLC helps to elevate the base game. From both a narrative perspective, as well as a game play one, ME3s DLC adds depth and much needed quiet moment. It is this reason why I feel like when taken as a whole, I have no issues with ME3s direction or story.",

He seemed to have 2 complaints:    \n\nIn the west, there doesn't seem to room for burlesque anymore--light-hearted sex comedy. A lot western media is either hyper-sexual or sterilized. Porn or toothless.    \n\nAlso, he perceives a sort of classist overtone. People seem to default to the notion that having de-sexualized characters in your game is inherently a good thing. That works containing sex and nudity outside of a dramatic context are automatically for imbeciles and we're *too good* for that sort of thing.    \n\nI tended to disagree. I compartmentalize. I want my humor funny and my sex to be sexy. It doesn't mean that I look down on people who do enjoy a mixture of both, it's just not my preference. Though, I did enjoy Sword Art Online, even with it's completely out-of-place, tonally wierd t&amp;a shots.    \n\nAnd speaking of anime, there is still a fair bit of burlesque in Japanese games. The recent controversy over Omega Labyrinth Z and other h-game titles show that there is still an audience for this sort of thing. I'm not talking about porn games, either. These are puzzlers and other game types with sexual elements and a heavy dose of comedy injected into them.    \n\nTL:DR    \n\nWhere do you stand? Is there room for burlesque in Western games? Do we like our light-hearted sex comedy? If you want to mention your country of origin in your response, I think we could get a rough sampling of differing opinions. I am from the northeastern United States.    \n\nIf you want to hear the discussion that inspired this question, you can check out our video below:    \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ULgNnfibCGU",

        "title": "Series feature accumulation: how does it affect development, and/or how does development affect it? (Pok√©mon vs. Mario Kart as examples)",
        "author": "3rdOption",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8u5gxz/series_feature_accumulation_how_does_it_affect/",
        "text": "(The core questions are at the end of this post **in bold**)\n\nGame Freak's tendency to throw away well-loved features between Pok√©mon games is an infamous source of exasperation to their fans, me included. Whether it is a solid, almost infinitely playable postgame like the Battle Frontier, a competent online battling system like the PSS, deep side activities like Contests, core battling styles like Triple and Rotation Battles, or minor additions for flavor like your lead following you, you can almost bet that if you really like a nice feature in a Pok√©mon beyond single battles, trading, and breeding, it will be gone the next game.\n\nI've been trying to look for reasons as to why Game Freak does this, and the first thing I looked at is development history. As you may know, [the time between main series installments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)#Summary_of_main_series_titles) alternates between biennial and annual. Because of this relatively short time between releases, I really had to wonder: is the reason behind Game Freak's seeming lack of foresight in regards to features due to the inability to implement them because of the short amount of time? Surely, a lot of that time has to be spent designing, coding, and implementing new Pok√©mon and moves alike, with little time left for keeping features in.\n\nSo, I decided to compare Pok√©mon's release schedule to that of another popular Nintendo series: Mario Kart. Mario Kart releases at a fairly constant [three years between each installment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart#List_of_Mario_Kart_games) with a strict limit of one per console (we'll have to see if the Switch gets its own true installment after the 8 Deluxe port). But the amount of well-loved features that the series has accumulated over the years is quite impressive. In Mario Kart 8 alone we have:\n\n* Super Mario Kart as a base (of course): items, hopping, drifting, mini-turbos and all.\n* Slipstreaming/drafting as introduced in 64 (though made more explicit as of Wii). Plus, it introduced polygonal graphics if that counts for anything...\n* Fan-favorite tracks from earlier games as introduced in Super Circuit (albeit standardized into its current form in DS).\n* Ability to select your kart independent of the driver as introduced in Double Dash (later refined in DS, and again in 7 in a way).\n* Online play as introduced in DS.\n* Motorbikes, ramp tricks, and multi-level mini-turbos based on how long you drift, all introduced in Wii.\n* Ability to build your kart-rider combination, gliding, going underwater, and a refined coin system that boosts your top speed, all introduced in 7.\n* Anti-gravity mode and super-fast 200cc mode, both introduced in 8.\n\n8 Deluxe later adds a few more on top of that:\n\n* Ability to hold two items at once as introduced in Double Dash.\n* The classic Battle Mode with an open arena from Super after it was removed in the original MK8.\n\nNeedless to say, Mario Kart in its current form is quite robust. So while Pok√©mon has a major problem keeping things that fans love with its space of 1-2 years between each major installment, Mario Kart just keeps growing its array of features with its consistent 3 year space between each installment.\n\n**The contrast between these two series has made me curious about how different series can accumulate features. So** **I have to ask several questions:**\n\n* **What other video game series do as good as or better than Mario Kart in regards to introducing, keeping, and refining good features?**\n* **Do these series have a steady release schedule, or does the increasing complexity increase the amount of time between installments?**\n* **I know that there are other factors such as budget, hardware limitations, disk space, and ability to recycle code between installments. How much do they affect feature accumulation, and are there any other factors that affect this?**\n* **Will there ever be a point where a series can NEVER improve beyond just \"the same but more levels/characters/weapons/walking area?\"**\n\n(EDIT: Had to correct due to new Reddit's glitchiness)",

It's why I, personally, never cared much for racism or sexism, as these are arenas where it is those who truly deserve the victory win, but here, loss is not the end, it is merely the beginning, a chance for us to see where we must improve, every victory a chance to reflect on what we have accomplished, on how far we have come. It's a battleground where anyone and everyone can compete, and skill becomes easily apparent the moment you enter that arena. For 14 years, a mere four years from it being my entire lifetime as of yet, I have also gleamed many lessons from gaming. Don't let anyone tell you gaming can't teach you much, as almost any game can help you learn so many things; to never give up, to keep trying and trying, to stand in the face adversity, even in the hardest challenge. Games that employ co-op mechanics teach you about teamwork, that, in the face of challenges that must be defeated by cooperation, the best way you can endure them is by finding that middle ground, the place where you and the other can cover eachothers' weaknesses, and compliment eachothers' strengths. Hell, even video games all about numbers can teach you a helluva lot about math, and some games based on history can teach you a portion of actual history (though I obviously recommend ensuring that you still learn at least partially from tried and true sources, or in other words, stay in school, kids). So, tell me, what is it that games offer that make you play them? Are there any deep reasons you enjoy them? Do they bring any fond memories to you? Feel free to add your reason.",

The actual mechanics such as oils, potions, etc. and dodging are fine. Geralt controls like too much of a tank and there's too much of a delay in between combat attacks being executed and being able to do other ones. Swimming was also terrible.\n* Geralt is a bit unappealing in a few ways. He certainly doesn't behave this monotone and gruff in the books. He also comes off like too much of a male power fantasy, specifically how scores of attractive and scantily dressed women always want to fuck him.\n* I eventually got sick of using detective vision, following the footprints/track marks, and then killing whatever you found. I felt as if this mechanic was relied upon too much.\n* Sense of progression just wasn't as good as other games. *God of War* has pretty light RPG elements and is mostly an action game, but even then I felt a stronger sense of progression when leveling up, acquiring new gear, and unlocking new skills.\n* You can't really interact with the world in a meaningful way, but I would say that most open world games suffer from this problem.\n* I think the writing was good...for a videogame. The setting, characters, etc. just weren't unique enough to overcome this (premise is good though), especially when compared to actual novels depicting similar things. The writing in video games are getting better and better with each successive calendar year, so I don't really think this aspect will hold up as well as people want to believe, even over the next decade. I honestly feel as if *Dragon Age: Origins* had much better writing as another \"gritty\" fantasy game.\n* Overload on map icons, although I can see how some people thought of this as a \"plus\".\n\nI also didn't enjoy *Fallout 3* as much as I thought I would. The main quest plot wasn't that good, the shooting out of VATs was terrible, and the map design kept ruining my immersion (like WTF is a settlement doing less than 50 feet away from a den of mutants and death claws)? I definitely preferred *New Vegas*. ",

        "text": "I have thought about this idea for a while. The game could be one of those make your own choices game like Until Dawn. Story wise they could make it when all the apprentices are still alive. So, basically it's Logan, Hoffman,Amanda, Gordon, Eleanor, and lastly John. It could feature the games that took place in between Jigsaw and Saw 3. There will be 3 different types of missions.\n\nPreparations:\nIt is basically the apprentices kidnapping the victims and stealing supplies for the traps. They will then go to a location and set up the traps. There will be security traps for the victims trying to escape from the game and the main games for the victims.Gordon will also be the one to insert keys into the bodies of the victims or poison. \n\nThe Game:\n These will feature the victims and the traps. They will need to work together and try to survive the traps, but if you fail to work together, people will get hostile and everyone will try to kill each other like in Saw 2. There will be specific messages that the tapes will say that the victims need to remember and certain details from flashbacks that the victims will have of their crimes.In the end either everyone dies,some people die, or look everyone lives. At the end based on how mentally messed up you are you can either be an apprentice or decline and live your life.\n\nThe Detectives:\nThese will feature detectives that we have seen in most of the Saw movies. They will feature Tapp, Matthews, Perez, Kerry, Hoffman, Riggs,Straham,  and Logan. There job are to figure out where the next game will be while trying to figure out who are the apprentices of Jigsaw. You will need to go to locations where you believe the hide out is and ask questions to victims who survive the games. While this happens, Logan and Hoffman will try to remove the evidence of what is going on without getting caught and will try to kill the other detectives if they are getting close to finding out the secret.\n\nWhat do you all think",

        "text": "Hey, All. \n\nI‚Äôm getting into the mechanic design for my game project, working title Project Thorn, and I‚Äôm having some thoughts on the design of the party mechanic I wish to implement. \n\nFor purposes that make sense In The narrative, I‚Äôm designing a character who has a fighting style that‚Äôs more stealth oriented, but also has the ability to swap essence with another character amongst her party, along with a unique play style (Similar to Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin or Shantae: Friends to the End). What I‚Äôm thinking is whether I want to design about 18 characters with a unique weapon style or make it 9 characters with 2 weapon styles. \n\nThe former I think would allow for easier animation but would need great attention to make sure each of the characters make sense and have a place In The world. The latter, on the other hand, would allow for a more focused cast but also require more animation. It‚Äôs not a detrimental factor, I know, but still one that I think is worth attention. \n\nAny input you guys could give on the matter would be most appreciated. Thanks. :)\n\nhttps://www.strawpoll.me/15971795",

        "text": "It's become nearly universal now: critics, let's players, streamers, essayists, analysts, these sorts of content creators on Youtube or Twitch have become a major part of the gaming community at large. Many people will engage with these things over the act of actually playing a game itself, often substituting watching a let's play or a streamer play a game during their free time rather than doing it first hand. Everyday forum conversations about a game frequently feature references or links to analysis videos on them: \"Oh it's funny that you mention xyz, because this youtuber mentions the same thing in his video on the game.\" Some of these people have even risen to a celebrity level of recognition and their opinions on games they stream or make videos of can make or break a small studio.\n\nSo I ask, what do you fine people of Truegaming think of this element in the current world of gaming? Is this a positive overall force in the industry, or for games as a hobby? Why has gaming in particular fostered such a level of interest and engagement in this kind of content on a level that, say, video reviewers of movies or books never received?",

My opinion:\n\n*Nier Automata*: The story and whole premise is amazing and beautifully told. The characters are wonderfully complex and genuinely original. The gameplay is also fun and doesn't rely on crazy flashy animations or gimmicky hooks.\n\n*Horizon Zero Dawn*: I would say probably the facial animations and some of the cinematic points in the game are going to age the worst. Many of the side quests will also seem dull/trivial. But beyond that, the gameplay is genuinely unique and compelling because of the enemy variety and how it is possible to tackle them in so many ways. The map is beautifully designed and its brilliant art design will hold up well, I think.\n\n*Bloodborne:* Unique premise, compelling gameplay, beautifully designed enemies, great music, etc. I think time will be kind to the Souls games. I just replayed *Demon's Souls* and it was still a blast.\n\n*Persona 5*: Engaging plot, beautifully distinct art style, wonderful music, and charming characters. The quality of life improvements since Persona 4 will definitely be further appreciated. Won't definitely age well is the fucking slow ass text dialogue and shitty fast fwd/text log.",
