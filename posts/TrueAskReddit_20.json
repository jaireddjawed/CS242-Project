After this, black friend got her makeup out and we daubed it all over pale friend. We were crying laughing and all took selfies, it was a bloody riot! But afterwards when sober, we wondered if it was ok. The three of us had so much fun with it we felt it must be ok, but a few weeks later I look back at the pictures and feel slightly guilty.

        "text": "For a while now, I've kinda felt like I have no stable social circle where I belong. For a couple years in undergrad, I had a fairly stable group of close friends. But after most of them graduated, I had a single class during a mainly gap year followed by a year of AmeriCorps, and now I'm in an intense 16-month grad school program.\n\nI'm wondering... is it typical in modern American society for people to not have a stable social circle? Is it **the norm**?\n\nSocial circles generally demand physical proximity, and people are typically bound together physically by close familial ties (living in the same household), by their jobs/schools, potentially by their religious groups, and maybe by some other groups/clubs.\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, people generally lived their whole lives within their village or clan. You would grow up within a pretty stable social group, and you'd maintain those relationships for all/most of your life while creating your own niche within that group. I think there's something.... *quaint* about that. We evolved to live in those sorts of social settings, and there's something kinda fundamentally compelling about it. \n\nEven in the 20th Century — which spawned the automobile and airplane and a shift away from agrarian communities — my grandparents raised a family in an incredibly stereotypical white suburb largely built by the GI Bill. It was a place where neither of my grandparents had been born, but through their church and neighborhood connections, they built a fairly stable social network that lasted for most of their adult lives.\n\nBut in the 21st Century, employers aren't as loyal to their workers. Even if you *can* stay employed at the same location for decades, it's often foolish to because employers won't provide raises or promotions that compensate for inflation, let alone allow one to climb the ladder into more prestigious roles. I've been told by numerous career advisers that, to grow your career, you can't expect to climb the ladder in the same company. You need to apply to other companies, to hop from one to another throughout your career. And this appears to be the norm for Millennials, who aren't staying with any single employer for more than a handful of years.\n\nAnd so, even if you *want* to 'put down roots' in a location to build and maintain a social network, it might be difficult to if there are few companies/firms related to your career. Add to that the fact that newer generations are less and less religious (and, thus, less likely to meet in churches/temples/etc.), **it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a decent-sized 'tribe' to belong to for any substantial amount of time.**\n\nGranted, I'm only 25, and my life has changed a lot these past few years. **But I'm kinda expecting to never have a consistent, reliable social group, and that makes me a bit anxious.** It's hard to feel like I belong anywhere or to feel like I can invest in people if I'm confident that one of us will move away soon. \n\nBut, OTOH, like many Millennials, I moved to a prominent metropolitan area with lots of job opportunities, so maybe my generation *can* 'put down roots', albeit in cities instead of small towns.\n\n--\n\nRedditors, do you have a \"tribe\" that you belong to? If so, who are they, and how did you all come together?",

        "text": "Let's say that all the nations of the world have miraculously come together to agree to designate or create an International Auxiliary Language (IAL).\n\nEnglish is perhaps the best candidate for an IAL today, spoken both regionally and around the world as a second language. It is the standard for international law, finance, trade, and science. However, English does come with a few strings attached, with an infamously steep learning curve and negative colonial associations.\nMany would see it as unfair to those who do not speak English as a first language.\n\nWould it be better then to create a new language instead of adopting an old one? A new language could be crafted that is easy to learn, speak, and write, as well as avoid the inevitable nationalistic grumblings of having one language superseding all others.\n\nedit: please forgive the title",
