        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/3rsemp/19_english_phrases_that_come_from_french/",
        "text": "So someone posted [this pleasantly-url'd buzzfeed article](http://www.buzzfeed.com/marietelling/non-non-non#.so2ywYm1m9) to /r/French, \"19 French Words You’ve Been Using Wrong Your Whole Life\". This article, seemingly written by a French person (there are two authors listed), lists a series of French-based phrases commonly used in (American ?) English and contrasts their \"correct\" modern French meaning to the \"wrong\" English one.\n\nNow, the eagerness with which some Americans especially will use such phrases at French people as if we'd (a) understand and (b) be overjoyed can indeed be quite annoying , so the authors have all my sympathy. Yet I post this here; why ? because all those phrases, in spite of their French origin, are *English* phrases, and it's simply impossible that all *English* speakers would be wrong about their meaning. There is simply no reason that English speakers should respect French usage while speaking English.\n\nIn addition to this, most of those phrases have been used in English for decades if not centuries, and it doesn't make sense to compare them to *modern* French usage. Quite probably, they were more consistent with French usage when English adopted them.\n\nA few details for specific phrases:\n\n* (4) *connoisseur*. That word was borrowed in the early 18th century if the wiktionary is to be believed. At the time the French spelling was the same. The French spelling was changed to \"connaisseur\" in 1835 to bring it in line with pronunciation (in olden times people cared about the Academy). So if anything, the English word is more conservative French-wise than the French one here.\n\n* (6) *Pret*. Actually in a phrase like 'prêt-à-manger' you should pronounce the T, so it makes perfect sense you should keep it in the apocope. French apocopes typically end on a vowel but English ones end on a consonant, that's just the way it is.\n\n* (9) *Garçon!* Strangely the author gets flak on that one in the comments (\"it literally means boy\", yadda yadda), but I'm totally behind her on that one. This is a phrase English speakers mostly use at French people, and it's absolutely something they should stop doing about seven decades ago.\n\n* (11) *Gourmet*. French marketers actually also use the word like English-language ones do, though not as much.\n\n* (12) *risqué*. It also means that in French (definition 2 [here](http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/risqu%C3%A9)), though *osé* are *salé* are more common.\n\n* (13) *Touché*. As it's used in English, it comes from fencing terminology, where it's still used to this day. The English usage is just an abstract extension of that. The modern French meaning of \"moved\" is largely irrelevant to all this.\n\n* (17) *Passé*. *Passé de mode* is common phrase in French meaning exactly that, and I'm quite surprised the author doesn't mention it.",

It's worth mentioning that this particular friend fancies himself a comic, so he went on a long rant and made a scene. As best I can remember it; it went something like this:\n\n\"How do you do research in linguistics when we already know everything? What are you gonna research? We already know everything. We know all the languages. We know how English works, we know how Chinese works - it's the little characters. We know the Romance languages come from Latin. Didn't you study Chinese in high school? Did you learn anything new about the language? No? Right! Dude, we know how languages work. If we didn't, how would I be talking to you? I get studying linguistics, but research? There's nothing new to learn. What are you gonna do with your research? Discover a new letter? We know all the letters.\"\n\nWhen I mentioned that what he was saying was akin to saying \"why do we study biology when the human body already exists,\" he came back with:\n\n\"Well, yeah, but we can still discover new things about how cells work, how we move, and what not. Dude, we literally already know how English works. You're not going to discover anything new with research in linguistics. We can examine the body and other things like that, but language is done.\"\n\nWhen I gave him the example of researching modern sound changes and the current Northern Cities vowel shift as an example of \"something new we can learn about English\" he came back with this gem:\n\n\"Well, if you had told me that at the beginning, we'd have been good. You're right, you can do research for like, stuff like that. Accents are big. If you want to be an actor or something you need to know how sounds change, like how I say 'water' differently from someone in the south. I get it. Accent research. Like for actors, right? That all makes sense now, I'm sorry.\"\n\nI excused myself very very quickly.",

The singular is \"panino\". Bugs me so hard!](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3pcyo7/til_that_spaghetti_is_actually_the_plural_form_of/cw5hws4)\n\nNot if you're speaking English.\n\n&gt;Same thing for Panini and Panino. People refer to Panini for a single sandwich when it's actually a Panino.\n\nAgain, because 'panini' is singular in English and refers to a specific type of sandwich.\n\n&gt;I was once all alone in a debate against pretty much everyone at my high school who claimed the plural of Spaghetti is Spaghettis. They all went on to become doctors and lawyers and astronauts while I am here still on reddit remembering how dumb they all are 15 years later.\n\nThey were right, assuming this high school was in an anglophone country.\n\n&gt;[This is why it bothers me when people say, \"raviolis.\" It's already plural, yo.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3pcyo7/til_that_spaghetti_is_actually_the_plural_form_of/cw5flj7)\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt;[\"Panini\" isn't an English word borrowed from Italian. It literally means \"sandwich\". We already have a word for that.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3pcyo7/til_that_spaghetti_is_actually_the_plural_form_of/cw5is5a)\n\nI don't really even know what they're trying to say here. But yes, 'panini' is an Italian loan word in English.\n\n&gt;[It really weirds me out when people say \"tamalee\" like it's a thing.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3pcyo7/til_that_spaghetti_is_actually_the_plural_form_of/cw5twzc)\n\nComo ya he explicado, this grammatical rule doesn't apply across languages. Most english speakers would say 'tamale', and that's fine.\n\nThere's probably a lot more in that thread, but much of it is pretty damn repetitive. You might say a bunch of *variazionis su un tema.*",

        "text": "You may have heard of [Reasoning with Vampires](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/), a tumblr dedicated to tearing apart Stephenie Meyer’s prose, run by a girl called Dana.\n\nWhat qualifies her to criticize other people’s writing? Well, [by her own admission](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1339099629/frequently-asked-questions-messaged-messages), nothing:\n\n&gt; I’m not an English teacher or a copy editor. I do not have a degree in English, nor am I a student majoring in English. You are welcome to take this information and dismiss my criticism of Twilight because I’m supremely unqualified. Then again, Stephenie Meyer has a degree in English and doesn’t know the difference between moat and mote.\n\nYes, she admits that she doesn’t have any qualifications whatsoever, yet she thinks she knows better than a professional writer with a degree. If this doesn’t make you the poster child for the [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), I don’t know what does. This becomes even funnier when you realize that she has responded to criticism with [“I’m not sure which item on that impressive résumé of yours makes you qualified to dispense advice.”](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/25144850283) My God, that girl has no self–awareness!\n\nAlso, [she describes Lynne Truss’s *Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves* as “awesome.”](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/2088840467/faqfmm) We’re in for a wild ride here.\n\nAnyway, what pearls of wisdom does this self–proclaimed grammar expert impart on us? Oh, just the usual laundry list of peeves:\n\n* [literally](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/8020944541)\n* [further vs. farther](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/10071538834)\n* [who vs. whom](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1058676259) (Yes, she actually expects Stephenie Meyer to have her characters say “whom.”)\n* [beginning a sentence with a conjunction](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/939719365) (Even though she says that that is “not a strict rule anymore.” I guess because the Great Grammar Council decided so. Seriously, believing that correct usage is dictated by some authority is a running theme with her. In [another post](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/3952957459), she says that the spelling “email” is now “officially” correct because the Associated Press decided to allow it. Because, as we all know, the Associated Press is the supreme court of spelling.)\n* [ending a sentence](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1011446056) with [a preposition](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1060913485) (Yes, she even complains about that. Even the most rabid grammar nazis have given up on that, but she is determined to die on that fucking hill.)\n* And no, Dana, [you shouldn’t bother with the split infinitive](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/992349749). After all, [you think it’s perfectly okay when *you* split infinitives](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1521992978).\n\nAnd by the way, you sure like citing [merriam-webster.com](http://www.merriam-webster.com/) whenever you disagree with the way a word is used. Maybe you should try watching some of their videos:\n\n* http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0038-literally.html\n* http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0025-preposition.html\n* http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0024-whowhom.html\n\nOther highlights:\n\n* A pronoun or participle doesn’t refer to the last noun mentioned? [I’m](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/3234112498) — [so](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/6195135356) — [confused](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1231472871)! [Even when agreement makes any misunderstanding impossible!](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/1577067199) It’s also very hypocritical of her to complain about (supposed) syntactic ambiguity when she produced [this gem of a sentence](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/19417983294):\n\n&gt; There has to be a better way to describe Bella’s state of mind after talking about sex with her father.\n\n* [Our language expert has never heard](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/4212485044) of the [etymological fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy). Note how she cited a dictionary other than Merriam-Webster this time, because she doesn’t like [the definition it gives](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anniversary):\n\n&gt; the annual recurrence of a date marking a notable event; *broadly* :  a date that follows such an event by a specified period of time measured in units other than years &lt;the 6-month *anniversary* of the accident&gt;\n\n* [The verb *to sit* can’t be transitive!](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/3153527317) This time she doesn’t cite *any* dictionary because they *all* disagree with her.\n* She sees double negatives where [there](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/2348381227/faqmm) aren’t [any](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/2768222292).\n* The, as far as I can see, only genuine grammar error she found is in a [pre–release copy](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/5298817836). Also, she seems to believe that *to belong* is not a verb.\n* [I’m not unreasonable because I don’t *always* shame you for breaking imaginary rules!](http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/post/3363514688)\n\nThere is much more nonsense where that came from. I’ll leave the rest to you.",
