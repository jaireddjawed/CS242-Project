Yes.  Nonsense?

        "text": "The second story is “Brothers” by Sherwood Anderson (1921). That Anderson was a contemporary of Faulkner and Hemingway is evident in his style of writing - true to the medium, the story is very short but took me three read throughs to feel like I grasped it. Likely, I could reread “Brothers” 10 more times and come away with a more nuanced perspective than what I have now. \n\nAt it’s most basic, this is a story about connection. The human need for it, the ways in which we take for granted those who we are so deeply connected to that our lives are intertwined, the connections we create in our minds to people we feel are out of reach, or who may never have existed in the first place. On its surface, it is a grisly, loosely connected tale of a murder and an elderly man’s descent into mental decline, but it’s even darker as the reader finds the two separate stories merging into a statement about the human condition that we all take part in together. \n\nQuotable: “The whole story of mankind’s loneliness, of the effort to reach out to unattainable beauty tried to get itself expressed from the lips of a mumbling old man, crazed with loneliness, who stood by the side of a country road on a foggy morning holding a little dog in his arms”. \n\nThanks for all the love on my previous post!

        "text": "The first story in this anthology is Edna Ferber’s “The Gay Old Dog” written in 1917. I love that I can google images of unfamiliar terms like “kolinsky cape”, “aigrette” and “soubrette” to get a rich mental image of the author’s intentions (and learn new words in the process!). This is the story of Jo, a man saddled with the deathbed promise to his mother to care for his three sisters, and how that promise ultimately led to an empty life, despite some good fortune along the way. This story struck a chord with me from the beginning - as an eldest sibling, Jo’s dedication (turned obligation) to his sisters was familiar and jarring. Ferber warned in the beginning “this is not a humorous story” and she was not being facetious. The darkness surrounding this family dynamic is something that, over a century later, we don’t talk about enough. Despite the aigrettes, this story is just as relevant in 2023 as it was in 1917. Quotable: “Death-bed promises should be broken as lightly as they are seriously made. The dead have no right to lay their clammy fingers upon the living”. \n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "He’s not half the essayist Orwell was, but I’m nothing if not a sucker for travelogues through America by foreigners who were already established authors. Anyways, I came across this quote…\n\n“…So far as I am concerned, it is the whole point about feminism and the factory. It is very largely the point about feminism and many other callings, apparently more cultured than the factory, such as the law court and the political platform. When I see women so wildly anxious to tie themselves to all this machinery of the modern city my first feeling is not indignation, but that dark and ominous sort of pity with which we should see a crowd rushing to embark in a leaking ship under a lowering storm…..for powder and patches soon went out of fashion, but bread does not go out of fashion. In the same way, if women desert the family for the factory, they may find they have only done it for a deserted factory.”\n\nNeo-traditionalists share this exact view, down to blaming capitalism on tricking women into joining the workforce and killing the family, but my sense of the movement is that they are idolizing the 1950s. Chesterton published this book 30 years earlier. Likewise, there are many examples of thinkers in the early 20th and 21st centuries crying out about the same problems in society. In some cases I think the 21st century version of the problem really is worse (TikTok is worse for attention spans and social spirit than newspapers ever were), some have always been a problem and still are (what really motivates the political class), and some seem to be perennial scapegoats (everything wrong with society is a problem of capitalism). However, I know that’s not how everyone sees it. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "Read \"The Blind Owl\" , a 1937 novel written by Iranian author Sadegh Hedayat, who gave touch of modernity to Iranian literature. The plot of the novel is solely based upon imagination, contemplation and speculation by the protagonist , who is an Artist. There are various characters like an old man, a butcher, a nurse, a beautiful woman, who keep on repeating in different situations across the novel. A unique feature of The Blind Owl is deliberate repetition of sentences throughout the novel, but with every repetition there is something different which gets added and overall gives a new perspective. Sadegh Hedayat has also given many references to Indian culture and its spirituality because he became heavily influenced by Hinduism,  Buddhism during his visit to India. The mention of Benares, temples of India, Lingam in the temples and the temple dancers enhance the effect of imagination by the protagonist.\nThe novel is definitely not a light read, because all the imaginative plots consist of sorrow, negative emotions, confusions which constantly run in a seemingly never ending loop. The ending is neither a happy nor a sad one. But despite not being a light read, I personally liked \"The Blind Owl\" because of unique portrayal of imaginative thinking.",

        "text": "I found reading this marvelous book by Mr. London to be a powerful and poignant experience. The lesson contained within this novel is a hard ration to choke down. Truth can often be so. It was riveting following Buck's journey from a domesticated hunting companion through to his end where he answers that call deep in the Alaskan wilderness. I was as confused from the start as when Buck was when stolen from home and thrust into that stranger world beyond imagining.  And when The Law of Club and Fang, taught by cruel men and beasts, made Buck and I a pupil we were sad, afraid, but undaunted and that lesson never forgotten. When we were running in traces a great pride stirred within my breast as well as Buck's. Fury took its place when ownership changed and we had to suffer many indignities from incompetent masters. But the great abatement came when he found love with the good John Thornton, who saved him from utter death. Still paining me is that sadness when Buck could not answer the call with his Brother of the Wild on their first meeting. And I wont forget his return to the destroyed camp, finding his companions fettered with arrows, man and dog. And overcoming was that illusory sense that his master had been killed though his body, his scent, was nowhere to be found... rage, blinding rage was Buck's as well as mine. As Buck eventually passes into legend a great catharsis overcame me, something of the sublime to be experience from great literature. I am lucky to have found this book.  \n\nAs I understand it the lesson in this story is that the primal or primordial nature (which Emerson would just call *Nature*) reigns king over all laws and dominions of mankind. I have been reading another book by Herbert Spencer called On Social Evolution. One of his many arguments is that as long as society develops the barbarous traits necessary to our survival must fall away with progress and the evolution of the Human Social Sphere. He argues that all evil is nonadaptation of constitution to condition. I believe Mr. London would agree with me when I say this latter is a flawed argument. Mr. Spencer believes that this evil nature in man (warfare, criminal activity, etc) will be made obsolete with proper development of society and of man.\n\nHe may be correct. Some of what Mr. Spencer predicts has occurred. I think he is a sophist, if I use the term correctly. I prefer Mr. London's lesson. I even agree to the point that these primordial traits reign supreme under all circumstances. This was my introduction to Jack London and I understand that his body of work tackles similar topics. \n\nThe version I read I picked up at a local used book store. The copyright is dated 1931 and the booksleeve from the time is fairly well in tact. It was printed by Grasser and Dunlap with copyright by way of The Macmillan Company. This was printed as part of a children's favorite series, which is a little surprising considering the great descriptions of violence throughout the novel. My book is near 100 years of age and the pages are quite fragile. Each time I read it my shirt would be covered in book flakes. I had to gently thumb through it else they would break off or tear. I loved reading through the old and modest print, it felt such of it's time. We even have a few pretty illustrations making appearances from time to time. \n\nMy favorite author is Cormac McCarthy and I can not help but feel that he was a fan of Mr. London. For the first time in reading any novel I made note of how well edited COTW was. I am surprised i never I thought something like this worth noting before. Mr. London's language is able to impart abstractions, descry deep emotions, give sage advice, and paint beautiful landscapes all the while being straight to the point. I find that impressive. To be confined yet express such profundity. I'll heed that lesson immediately.",

        "text": "doing an extended essay on portrayals of masculinity in a farewell to arms. Clearly Hemingway has a unique writing style, and his 'iceberg' approach, where he omits key details in order to draw attention to them, or something like that is apparently a major thing. I'm just struggling on how to analyse it in passages from the book. Take this passage for example, between Henry and Rinaldi:\n\n*“This war is killing me,” Rinaldi said, “I am very*\n\n*depressed by it.” He folded his hands over his knee.*\n\n*“Oh,” I said.*\n\n*“What’s the matter? Can’t I even have human impulses?”*\n\n*“No. I can see you’ve been having a fine time. Tell me.”*\n\n*“All summer and all fall I’ve operated. I work all the time.*\n\n*I do everybody’s work. All the hard ones they leave to me. By*\n\n*God, baby, I am becoming a lovely surgeon.”*\n\n*“That sounds better.”*\n\n*“I never think. No, by God, I don’t think; I operate.”*\n\n*“That’s right.”*\n\n*“But now, baby, it’s all over. I don’t operate now and I feel*\n\n*like hell. This is a terrible war, baby. You believe me when I*\n\n*say it. Now you cheer me up. Did you bring the phonograph*\n\n*records?”*\n\n*“Yes.”*\n\n*They were wrapped in paper in a cardboard box in my*\n\n*rucksack. I was too tired to get them out.*\n\n*“Don’t you feel good yourself, baby?”*\n\n*“I feel like hell.”*\n\n*“This war is terrible,” Rinaldi said. “Come on. We’ll both*\n\n*get drunk and be cheerful. Then we’ll go get the ashes*\n\n*dragged. Then we’ll feel fine.”*\n\nDoes Hemingway use omission here? You can clearly get the sense that Rinaldi has been affected deeply by the horrors of war, but the way he describes it makes his emotions feel very superficial and not as deeply damaging as you would expect them to be. I assume this is a product of Hemingway's iceberg style, and I think the way he talks about his emotions is relevant when analysing his masculinity, but how would i go about it?\n\nThanks in advance, keen to get some perspective :)",

        "text": "(Title is probably an overstatement, in service of making my point).\n\nIMO, Plath's *The Bell Jar* is the \"classic\" most miscategorised due to it's author's biography. Obviously, the plot and premise is dark - it's essentially a collection of vignettes drawn together by the  chronological worsening of Esther's mental state - but people seem to interpret the book's outlook hopelessly, purely because Plath herself famously committed suicide. \n\nI am genuinely confused by the perception of the book as \"depressing\", or especially dark. Plath infuses Esther's situation with hope, and even when she's excavating the most specific and painful experiences via prose, she purposefully imbues a dry wit and almost broad humour throughout.\n\nAs an example - take Esther's early recollection of a weekend spent with Buddy, when she first realises Buddy's hypocrisy about virginity. The entire thing is dripping with sarcasm, and the moments where Buddy convinces Esther to look at his naked body, we are treated only to Plath's droll analogy for how it looks - like a turkey's neck - and Esther's response that she no longer feel like returning the favour. I remember reading this for the first time and laughing out loud at the situation, which surprised me because I'd anticipated the book being depressing. The details she includes about Buddy's choice to undress very neatly, folding his pants on the chair, and \"bragging\" (?) about his very practical underwear fabric are obviously in service of a character-based humour. Buddy Willard (especially Esther's wry critique of he and his mother) is the most consistently funny character in the book. \n\nAnother more immediate example is the food poisoning sequence, which almost reads like farce. Esther's laser-focus on the spread of food and her bizarre culinary choices -- stuffing crab meat and caviar into the heart of an avocado - contrasts with how she is betrayed by the food surreally. \n\nEven Esther's gradually escalating self-harm and suicide attempts are funny to me at times? The way she describes the lameness of having tied a noose around her neck, but has no where to hang it, and is thus walking around the house with the noose telling behind her uselessly creates a funny image. \n\nI could list examples endlessly. I suppose I've just never seen a genuine appreciation for Plath's wit and sense of humor in the book, and the way the book is treated like some hyper-serious tome for suicidal teenage girls bothers me. There's some real self-awareness here that feels ahead of it's time, and I almost feel like the miscategorisation of tone is because Esther is a woman. \n\nMaybe I'm just a weirdo.",

        "text": "So I have finally finished Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With the Wind and oddly enough, even though it started out as a book that I really thought was not meant for me, it ended up being one of the best books I’ve read in a very long time. I’m not saying that I know enough about the Civil War or know enough about Margaret Mitchell to know that this is what they were going for but I’m gonna do my very best to explain what I got from this book and why I think this book was so impactful on me.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints that I saw going into this book was the character of Scarlett, and how melodramatic and vain and manipulative she was, and at first, I found it honestly quite comical, and I didn’t see much point beyond it being comical. I think as the story progressed and her desires, and the desires of the characters around her became more evident and more rooted within their circumstances, it became clear to me that her character was not just being played for laughs, but was an integral part of what Margaret Mitchell was trying to say, which is comparing act of desperation to chase idealizations in order to regain peace and sanity versus the things that will truly bring you peace and sanity, in this case being gratitude and tenderness. I think that the Civil War created a background that juxtaposed this idea of there clearly being a right side and a wrong side, versus the reality of complications and subtleties that create this gray area where, upon first glance, you might think that it is clearly a black and white scenario. Scarlett pines after men and it’s believed by her and the reader that that’s the end goal, and it’s only realized halfway through that the goal itself is much bigger and won’t actually be solved by her actions or immediate desires. This goes for most of the characters in the book as well — comical until they serve a purpose. We follow all of these characters who have their lives completely torn apart by the tragedy of war, and what follows is over 1000 pages of every character consistently complaining that they will never have what they want and what will make them happy. I can definitely see that turning a lot of people off from this book but I think when I realized that Margaret Mitchell’s point is not about finding happiness, but finding peace in life and finding gratitude in what you have, despite circumstances being potentially tragic, it made me appreciate that thousand page build up a lot more. I can now look back and say “oh yeah, this is what it was all leading up to, and now that I’m seeing that payoff, I’m able to appreciate the journey a lot more” which to me is a sign of a great novel. I probably have more to say about this book so if anyone is interested, I can probably elaborate more but I’ll keep it at that and say that this was definitely a five star read for me, and then I would highly recommend that you check it out if you think you can handle such a hefty novel. It took me a long time, but I’m glad that I read it, so.",
