Also while you're on your way back, get us some Marinara, we won't pay unless we get these from you\"\n\nMy initial inside reaction was... Wow.... REALLY?! Never mind the fact that I left you a message regarding the delivery prioritization change because i needed your apartment number, but now, right off the bat you're gonna talk to me like i'm your bitch and you would demand that I turn 180 Degrees around if I didn't kiss your ass thoroughly? Jesus Christ people..\n\nI'm actually glad my other delivery was close, and that I couldn't deliver to them first.. Saved me a ton of pointless and unnecessary trouble (though shame i couldn't avoid the unpleasantness.\n\nBack to the call, I sternly replied \"You will have to pay 50 cents per Marinara, and also I never got your Apartment number. I had to prioritize another delivery over yours because of this reason.\"\n\nThey finally gave me the apartment number, but Jebus, even they called the store in a nasty mood, like seriously people, what have we done to receive such treatment? I hope they have just an equally nasty holiday &gt;_&gt;\n",

        "text": "So I recently got an invitation for two interviews in one day - one is for a busboy position at a well-known restaurant chain that's fairly busy in my area, and one is for a well-known pizza chain that's pretty popular in my area as well, probably #2 in terms of popularity in my town just from the delivery cars I've seen. I've never worked a position in either of these fields, but my background has aspects that apply to both.\n\n\nMy family and friends haven't been much help to me in deciding what to do if I'm lucky enough to get offered both positions. Most are against the delivery driver option because of the danger aspect, which I've considered. However, I need money and a flexible schedule since I'm in college, and I realize both positions get tips, so if I only get one offer, I'll obviously take it. I'm also worried of the possibility of getting offered any other job before this chain restaurant, as their interview is typically a two-interview process from what I've read. Additionally, every place I check online says something different when it comes to pay for these two particular places. On one hand, I'd like to be in a stable environment with a set pace (although it'll be very hectic), and on the other, a little independence and quietness as a delivery driver seems appealing too (but not the prospect of getting robbed, either).\n\n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** -- I'd really appreciate it if I could get any former/current server, busser or delivery person's opinion on which route will be the best in terms of salary and hours. My interview is tomorrow but I JUST had the idea of asking Reddit... thanks.\n\n**edit:** To clarify, I'll probably only be working 25ish or so hours 4-5 nights out of the week if I can (Fri and Sat included).",

But still, it's just common courtesy not to order because this isn't like buying a candy bar at the store. The pizza has to be made, cooked, and then delivered, leaving everyone in the shop to stay late. Plus, we try to get as much cleaning and post-shift prep done in the time leading up to close so that we can get out as quickly as possible, but now that plan is blown out of the water.

So my question is for people that deliver during the week between 10am-5 or 6pm. Do you still tend to make good money in those hours? Jimmy johns got me a ton of $1-$2 tips, and I'd be lucky to make $50 in a six hour shift. So I was considering switching it up to pizza since orders would typically amount to much higher on average.

There are some good ideas found there, and some things are unchanged as expected. \n\nThe last time I delivered pies was back around 1990, for Dominos in Southern CA.  Average money at the time was around $12-15 per hr (min wage+tips+del fee)\n\nWe had no GPS or mobile phones back in 90-91, so deliveries could be a real challenge at times - especially in the apartment jungles we had in the area, and in newly developed/unmapped tracts. \n\nFlash forward and I'm 49, semi-retired, and just signed on as part-time with Dominos again, this time in East TN.\n\nWhat brought me back was I remember delivering as being FUN, and some of your posts confirm that it still is.  Also, the pay is just enough to cover some of my hobbies ... And schedule flexibility is a must since retirement allows plenty of play time (camping).  ;)\n\nIn our area we have D's, PJ's, and PH.  Am I correct that they're all about the same for drivers?  What is the average daily take home pay these days?\n\nThanks again for your posts - It'll be fun to keep reading them.\n\nBe safe - Be well - Be kind\nLotso",

Also I have to idea where the other $1.50 is as I don't think I see it on our pay stub.\n\nAny help and advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: the $2.00 is taken into our tips at the end of the night, then we pay 50¢ per delivery to this \"miscellaneous fund\" and due to the way it's set up we are actually taxed on that 50¢ which adds up to quite a bit.",

        "text": "So as many of my fellow One-of-the-big-three drivers know, there was an update to our store POS system recently (it has a name like what nurses take at the doctor's office). I may complain about its issues sometime later, but I think that the new update may have screwed up when timed orders drop.\n\nI am a little more aware of and look for timed orders on the dispatch screen than many others at my store, so I thought that other people just weren't catching them, and I was starting to get mad bc then I end up being the one to take these orders late and have to apologize and shit. \n\nIt took me a bit to figure this out, but I'm pretty sure that the timed orders are not actually being made long enough in advance, and I didn't notice until we had a slow day (our store is super busy most of the time). \n\nThere was absolutely nothing to hold these two orders up on the makeline, they weren't large orders either but they were being cut and boxed just a couple minutes before they were due to arrive. The 8:05 order was fully boxed at 8:03, the 8:15 at 8:10. \n\nNormally they are out of the oven and ready to go about 20 minutes before arrival so I suspect that the way our POS handles timed orders has changed and it's dropping them too late. \n\nAnyone else notice this? If it's systemic, at least some of you may be able to help me substantiate it, if not, there's something massively wrong with our store. Thanks! ",

An hour and a half into my shift, I am taking this delivery to an apartment that took my 25 minutes to find. Keep in mind this was yesterday in Chicago and we got hit with a snow storm. As I'm walking back to my car, my stomach rumbles and I stop to relieve my flatulence. BIG MISTAKE. I could feel the wetness and knew something was not right. I start going into panic mode as my brain starts scanning for possible solutions and what to do. Luckily these apartments had a long garage, and behind the garages was open land going into the forest preserve. I slip behind the garages and start taking my pants off. I am wearing layers due to the weather being so cold. I thrown my boxers in the dumpster and drive to the nearest Walmart and bought myself a 3 pack and run into the bathroom to clean myself. \n\nThis is a story I will take to the grave with me.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/DrAd6",

Got set and took off with the order and I get to the townhouse (a complex mainly filled with the elderly) and knock on the door...  And again and again.  Finally I call the number on the receipt, which has an odd area code but its the same 10 digit format as any US number.  A dude with a thick accent answers the phone, confirms he ordered the pizza for his elderly mother.  He tells me that she is hard of hearing and has a bad leg, so he asks me to be patient and knock louder.  Couple mins go by and he asks me if I will go to the back of the building and knock there, and that I would please stay on the line until she answers the door.  So I walk back to the back patio door, knock some more, wait, nothing.  Looks like someone lives there as the house isn't empty.  I walk back to the front, knock one ore time, and when I see I've been there for about 10 mins I say to the guy that nobody is coming to the door and the pizza is now too cold to deliver.  I tell him I've been on the phone and at the stop for too long and then he INSISTS I stay on the phone, this is where i see a major red flag, I tell him to contact the authorities if he is that worried and hang up.  When I look at my phone I see the phone call was to an 876 area code which is in Kingston Jamaica apparently.\n\n\nFast forward to my next phone bill, $25 international charge on the bill, explain to boss, boss reimburses me, no harm no foul.  \n\n\nThen, later that day, he walks back to the driver area and says the same guy is on the phone trying to order another pizza to the same  location, same small pizza with one topping.  He just told him to basically fuck off and never call our store again and flagged the number in our system as I did with my phone company.  \n\n\nMoral of the story, make sure you keep track of when you might dial odd numbers, if you do get scammed like this and your employer has you use your personal phone, make sure they cover the charges that are incurred, I would have had no way of knowing this area code before that day,  We deliver to a lot of hotels so area codes from across the US are fairly normal to see.\n\n\nI wasnt able to find any situation with a pizza delivery like happened to me, but I did read that these scammers often target the elderly with Jamaican lottery scams that end up racking up massive phone bill charges for those they are scamming.  \n\n\nJust watch out.",

My store would still deliver to these high risk parts of town despite previous robberies.\n\nFirst robbery:\n\nSo I get a hood run at around 11 (nbd to me at the time, I was used to it). I pull up to the house and see a light on in the driveway. I usually always go to the best lit door to knock. So I'm waiting for someone to answer, next thing I know, I hear a gun cock and see a black kid in all black with a bandana over his face come from the front of the house walking straight at me with a semi auto pistol, he puts the gun to my head and tells me to shut the fuck up and keep quiet.\n\nSo he proceeds to walk me over execution style with the gun still to my head to the other side of the house where two more of his goons were waiting. I started to just empty my pockets and throw everything on the ground. They all pick it up along with the pizza and the drink. Then the one with the gun to my head asks where my phone is, and I tell him it's in my truck.\n\nThey start walking me across the yard with the gun to the back of my head. As soon as we were about halfway to my truck I feel a hard crack on the back of my head, the fucker pistol whipped me with the barrel end of the gun. My legs turned to spaghetti and I look behind me and they're running away across the street.\n\nI yelled some pretty racist things I'm not proud of at them, then ran into my truck. I speed off the other direction when I notice my back is feeling wet. It wasn't sweat, like I thought, I was covered in blood all down my neck to my back and chest.\n\nLuckily I found a police officer patrolling near by who got an ambulance on site to clean me up. As I get out of the ambulance, a 90s Camaro with 3 black kids in it peeled out and sped off right next to us. The cop didn't do anything....\n\nSo some advice: don't be ignorant. Always check the phone number. If it looks fake call it. If they don't answer, don't take it. My phone number on my driver slip that night was a fake and I was too foolish to think about it. Also, never get out of your car in a bad area. Call and have them meet you outside.",

Got a two liter Sprite and a large pizza for you\"\n\n\"*mumble mumble* Where's my wings?\"\n\n\"...Hm? I'm... sorry, but there aren't any wings.

[This is sort of what the dog looks like](https://goo.gl/images/02GxBc) if you add at least a foot of height and make him white. This dog is huge.  \n\nI've delivered to this house multiple times, and none of these times have the owners kept their dog restrained. Since I'm relatively calm around dogs and do not get frightened easily, it has bothered me, but not to the extent that I said something. However, this dog has always been very menacing. \n\nThis particular evening I was arriving after the sun has gone down, which I was not happy about. When I called the house to tell them to open up their front gate, I was told to stay in my car because their dog gets more hostile at night. Awesome (half sarcastic) I was glad to stay in the car but worried about the dog. \n\nAs I enter the gate, here comes Fenrir and his miniature escorts walking down the driveway. I begin to roll my window down, but leave it up about 4 inches, which was enough for me to do business, but allowed me to feel safe at the same time. Lo and behold, once I get my window down as far as I put it, the pale horse cometh. \n\nThis freaking dog tried to jump through my window but his angle was wrong and I had it high enough to stop him. The girls are screaming. I'm just pissed off with a dogs face inches from mine barking and trying to get to me. \n\nI casually tell the oldest girl to come to the other side. I roll the window down and finish the exchange through the passenger window with satan's breath still warming the side of my neck. I get the money and I'm able to get the window up and get out of there with, you guessed it, NO TIP. \n\nI was pissed...RING it's the customer. These are the wrong wings, \"ok no problem ma'am. I'll get the right ones and have them back asap.\" \n\nWhen I got back I told my GM that I was never going there again after I got back, but I would take this last order because I didn't want anyone else having to deal with the dog or getting stiffed on **my** order. \n\nI got back to the house and they must have kept their hellhound in his stables with some helpless orphan as a chew toy. They gave me 5 bucks this time, I guess as a \"you survived the beast\" consolation prize. \n\nWhen I got back to the store I told the story to the other managers and they wanted to know why I didn't punch the dog in the nose. \"I didn't want to get fired.\" To which they explained that I am allowed to defend myself from any threat. Granted I wasn't truly threatened just extremely uncomfortable but I would have loved to hurt that dog for disrespecting my personal space. \n\nNeedless to say I now carry a can of Freeze plus P which is pepper spray and tear gas mixed. I don't carry it on me though, it's only for that one dog, if I ever have to go there again. \n\nEdit: a word",

There's an SUV to my right, I'm in the left lane doing the speed limit because I need to make a left turn. \n\nThe SUV driver cuts me off with no time to react to his turn signal (he actually turned it on right as he had two wheels already in my lane) and I honked. \n\nThis enrages him and he brake checks me and flips me the bird, making all sorts of hand gestures. And he gets right back in the right lane! There was absolutely no one behind me. \n\nWe're coming up to a yellow light, so I speed up, not wanting to wait at the light with this guy because I'm worried he may try to get out. Light turns red when I'm halfway through the intersection and he ends up stopping at the light. \n\nUnfortunately, we're required to have our chain's billboards on our cars when we deliver because of policy. \n\nWhen I get back, I'm told that the driver who cut me off, complains that I cut him off, forced him off the road, and ran a red light. All of which are false and the red light is half and half depending on road laws in your state. \n\nApparently our store is going to believe the word of the driver of the SUV and my SM wants to write me up, despite knowing about my dash cam. SM left before I got back and so I showed my AM the footage. \n\nThe dash cam saved me from a write up and the AM isn't going to do a report. Thank god I only have two days left at this place! My SM already wrote me up for something this week that she didn't like and it seems she's trying to find something else to complain about. \n\n\nI'll post the footage to YouTube at some point. If my SM complains to me tomorrow before work, I plan on quitting before the shift unless she takes a look at my footage. A good employer listens to their employees. \n\n\nAt least the last table I cleaned before I clocked off for the night tipped $4. So ended on a positive note. ",

I watch our son during the day, have worked for myself for the past six years, but with a little guy zipping around, it's impossible to continue doing this. Wife works from home.\n\nSo, I was scheduled for a four hour shift, but was asked if I could close since someone called out. No problem. Around 9:30pm, an advance order comes in through the web for 10:15pm and it's going to one of the two major employers in town and has a tip of $8.95 already on there. This place is literally three minutes down the road. With the gas reimbursement, this would come to over $10. I want it!\n\nSo, it's me and one other driver. As we hit around 10:06pm, I'm getting nervous because she's next in line, but then two deliveries come in, each of which is very nearby. So, we both head out, and I'm busting my ass to get back before her because it's FIFO. I figure by the time I get back, if I get back first, the order will be in the system and I can grab it.\n\nI race to the apartment complex, run up the stairs, conduct the transaction, run back down, and race back to the store. YES! Her car is not there! I'm going to get the run!\n\nI hustle into the store and check in. I see two orders on the screen, so I get the next one, which I was CERTAIN was the $10 tip order. NOPE!\n\nIn the few minutes I was gone, and before the system updated with the advance order, someone called in with another order...15 minutes away. Ugh!\n\nSo, not only did I not get the easiest $10 tip of my life, but I also ended up driving 15 minutes out into BFE for a $2 and some change tip.\n\nMoral of the story? There really isn't one. Just wanted to share my pain. I joked with the other driver when we met up at the store later and she simply said, \"I got you\". All ended well.",

        "text": "I live in a house that's been divided into apartments, 2 downstairs, 1 upstairs. To reach my front door you go in what was once the house's front door and my door is right there in the hallway. The front door for the upstairs apartment is up a flight of stairs that's at the end of the hallway. The other night my husband and I stepped out on the front porch and noticed an unfamiliar vehicle. A woman got out and asked if we had ordered pizza. We hadn't, but I asked about the address she was looking for and found out it was for our upstairs neighbor. I directed the driver how to find the door. She got back in her vehicle and made a call (I'm presuming to my neighbor) that didn't last very long. (I'm guessing no answer.) Then the driver left. \n\nMy husband and I talked briefly about that's why we always try to be outside around the time that we expect our delivery. We have no idea if the driver would be comfortable coming to our front door, especially at night. Our hallway lights are on motion sensors, and you have to come in the door by several feet before they turn on. No driver is going to know that. So as a driver you're looking at having to go through a front door, into a dark hallway, to try to knock on the door. If it were me I would nope out of there. So now I'm curious, what is a driver's take on that kind of delivery situation? Would you rather the customer be waiting outside, or do you want to go to the door to be sure it's the right people? And how much is your answer influenced by the neighborhood? (For the record, it's not a good neighborhood.)",

        "text": "I posted this as a reply to a comment and someone said I should post it here.\n\nI live in Wisconsin. Winters aren't the best here. Not the worst either, but we can get some pretty bad snow storms. I live in a small town where part of the town literally has dirt roads off the main road to get to some of the houses. \n\nSo a customer orders a pizza and when I look where I'm delivering this to...guess what its out on one of the dirt roads. Honestly this was my first winter as a delivery boy(not my first winter in Wisconsin). So its been going quite well and I think nothing of it. Get to the road I'm supposed to turn on. I take the turn and NOTHING is plowed. Great its the start of the dirt road. There is probably a foot of snow not touched by any human being in the last 2 hours. \n\nI'm driving a little two door front wheel drive car(Chevy Cobalt). So I back up and start gaining speed hoping I don't get stuck. Somehow I make it 12 feet without getting stuck to where people actually live and have shoveled, I'm still not to my destination yet. I come around the corner and there is probably a 7 foot tall Hill between me and the customer, but there is a straight road aligned with the hill that I can back up into and gain speed to hopefully just coast over this thing. \n\nSo I back up and start to accelerate. I'm going maybe 25-30 mph before I even hit the hill. Well it was a no go. Sense plows don't go back there to salt the roads it was mainly snow with ice underneath it. I made it 75% of the way up the hill before I just stop dead and start sliding back. So as I'm sliding to my left are trees, to my right...are more trees. My car slowly starts to turn left which if I kept going, was straight into a tree. I'm not sure how I did this, but I was able to get stopped and I put my car in reverse. Somehow that gave me more traction and I was able to straighten myself out to just slide straight down the hill.\n\nI ended safely at the bottom of the hill where I started. I'm literally less than a min from where I'm supposed to be. So I call the customer and say \"hey listen I'm really sorry could you meet me by the hill that leads to your house, I can't get up this thing.\" Which he answers back. \"yeah sure no problem this happens a lot. We'll be down there in a couple minutes.\" \n\nThis mother fucker comes over the hill with [one of these fucking things](http://www.americantracktruck.com/uploads/images/Gallery/TrackTrucks/Jeep-Rubicon-Wrangler-Laredo-Limited-sport-snow-tracks-dominator-track-truck-track-kit-track-system-44-American-Track-Truck-groomer.jpg) takes the pizza and drives up the hill like it was 90 degrees out on a fucking Sunday. He did tip me $10 which is more then average, but WTF!?\n\n",

        "text": "So I've delivered to this house a total of 4 times and I don't know where this story is going but only someone who delivers pizza can appreciate this. I apologize for the format since I'm on mobile. \n\n\n1st Time: The first time I had ever delivered to this couple, maybe in their early 50's. They were about 10 minutes from our store. My mom had taken the car I usually drive, 2013 Camry Hybrid, so I was delivering in our 2006 Chrysler Town and Country. I ring the door bell and a woman opens the door. I hand her her delivery and ask her to sign the receipt. While signing, she looks over at my van and says, \"Oh that's a great truck you have there, what year is it\"? I was taken aback a bit, but reply 2006, hand over her copy and go back to my car and see that they left me no tip. Not going to lie, I was a little angry that she compliments my shitty car then stiffs me. \n\n\n2nd Time: I deliver to this house a few weeks later again. I recognize the name and already know I'm getting stiffed. I'm delivering in my usual car now. The husband answers the door, we exchange pleasantries, and he tips me $2. Not bad, I'm OK with it, but still a little annoyed. \n\n\n\n3rd Time: It's been a month since I last delivered to this house. They ordered a couple pizzas and drinks. I pull up to the house and the Husband is outside smoking a cigarette with another man, they are kind of dressed nicely. I hand them their food, and he tips me $5. I'm satisfied. \n\n\n4th Time: I recognize the name on the ticket and see the address for the local funeral home. $300 worth of food. I arrive and realize they were hosting something at the house because an SO must have passed away. They tip me $40. I don't know what to say, so I just express my condolences and thank them for the tip. \n\nI've been thinking about it past couple of days, and feel really bad for talking shit about them for 2 months to my co-workers.",

        "text": "Basic rules of pizza delivery: Don't enter the building. Definitely don't get closed in. If anything looks suspicious, just leave. Your life is worth more than $20 and a pizza.\n\nAs a petite blonde girl in her early twenties, I repeat these rules to myself during each delivery.\n\n\n*knock knock knock*\nI rap on the unforgiving hotel room door, thinking this should have been a quick trade. I exchange the pizza for money then I am on my way! Except this is the third time I've knocked. The knuckles on my right hand are raw from the knocking and my left arm has lowered the pizza to about hip height and is now barely maintaining that elevation. At this point I don't know if there is shuffling on the other side of the door or if the hopeful part of my brain is just imagining the noises to torture me.\n\nSuddenly the door swings open and my patience is rewarded! I am not going back to the store empty-handed! (Or pizza-handed, I suppose)\n\nOn pure instinct I step away from the door, because deliveries to invisible people are never smooth. Then a head peeks around the door. As someone who stands at 5'1\" I am not accustomed to looking down at people, yet here I am staring at a scruffy older gentleman with a salt and pepper beard who comes up to about my chest.\n\n\"Delivery for Dave? Total is $20.55.\"\n\n\"Sure, could you put it down over there?\" The gruff man gestures toward the general interior of the room.\n\nOh no no no. I have trained for this moment! I know the answer!\n\n\"I apologize, Sir, but for safety reasons I am not permitted to enter the premises.\"\n\nThe door swings all the way open to reveal the man is in a chair. Not a wheelchair. A chair. He is wearing some sort of army jacket and boxers. Nothing else. I can clearly see that one of his legs has been amputated above the knee.\n\nI falter. At this point I am torn between concern for my safety and the manners I was taught. I mean, how rude would it be to just drop the pizza in this man's lap and hope he can scoot himself back into the room? Then again, he did scoot over to the door. Ok, now it's down to how fast this guy can scoot.\n\nUnsure how long I contemplated my options before moving or responding, I make a decision to enter the room just long enough to drop the pizza then immediately return to the door.\n\nThere is a small dinette table just on the other side of the man, but I choose to keep my distance and put it on the nearest bedside table.\n\nI step in the room. Big steps. How quick can I get to this table and back? Turns out, not faster than that door closes. I hear it shut behind me and think \"this is how I die?\" Just like that. Question mark and all.\n\nI turn to face the man and repeat the total, edging closer to the door as I speak. Maybe he'll have exact change and I can run?\n\nHe says, \"Could you hand me my wallet?\"\n\nI look back at the bedside table on which I've just set the food. No wallet. I look just behind the man at the small dinette table. No wallet.\n\nMy quizzical look must have given me away, because before I had a chance to ask, he told me it's on the bed. I look at the bed next to me. No wallet.\n\nHe says, \"Other bed.\" This is one of those hotel rooms with two double beds.\n\nI glance back at the door then across the room toward the bed where this mysterious wallet is supposed to be.\n\nNo no no no no no.\n\nOn that bed, I can't immediately see the wallet but I do see something that convinces me to make the trek across the room to retrieve it.\n\nHis prosthetic leg.\n\nI make my way across the room, between the beds. As I walk I make sure there is no scooting occurring behind me. Mentally I make a decision. If this man turns out to be a one-legged ninja rapist I am going to use his own leg to bludgeon him. It can't be too heavy to wield as a weapon, right?\n\n As I reach the bed, I realize the wallet is actually in the pocket of this man's pants. The pants he should really be wearing since he has a lady present. I confirm that he wants me to reach into the pocket and retrieve the wallet and he says to go ahead.\n\nAt this point I would be stoked if this guy hands me a $20 and lets me go. For those of you keeping track at home, yes that is a loss of $.55 as well as the gas and time I've spent here and no tip to compensate.\n\nThe man tells me to get what I need out of his wallet but that just feels wrong, so I hand it to him and repeat the total when asked.\n\nHe reaches in and pulls out a $50. I explain that I don't carry enough money to give him exact change, he'd be tipping me $10 if I gave him all the change in my pocket.\n\nHe says not to worry about it.\n\nStunned, I reach in my pocket to give him the money I have and he says the immortal phrase, \"Keep the change.\"\n\nNow I'm ashamed. I was damn sure that I was going to be raped and murdered in this hotel room, but now I've been given a $30 tip.\n\nDamn.\n\nI thank him profusely and then confirm again that he doesn't want his change back, because I just can't believe it.\n\nHe says not to worry about it.\n\nBut, quick question.\n\n\"Do you know anything about cell phones?\"\n\nI could have left.\n\nI could have said, \"no\".\n\nBut the man had just paid me $30 for a pizza delivery....\n\nSo I said I would take a look.\n\nAnd I did.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battery was in upside down.

        "text": "In my area there is a college, two factories, and a sort of school for at risk kids that have guard shacks. For the most part I know all the guards and how they like to do things. Some places/guards like you to stop, others don't care since they've seen me pretty much every day for the past year and just wave me through. Occasionally we get new people that want to do things differently, but they usually don't last long.\n\nI've only had one instance before tonight where I've had a guard angry at me. That instance was because I stopped 8 feet past the guard shack door (where every guard, including him, has told me to park). I got out of my car to give the customer my food and he popped out of his shack to tell me that I need to stop at the door next time. He even said ,\"I know who you are, who you work for, why you're there, and even who you're there for\". I usually go right to the parking place so I'm not in the way of other traffic since they like to block half their road with cones for some reason.\n\nAnyways, tonight I got yelled at by a guard at the local college. I had taken 6 or 7 deliveries there earlier in the night and during that time it was a guard that always just waves me through. At some point after that there was a change in shift and this new guy took over (lets call him Bob). Bob as far as I'm aware has never run the shack by himself before and apparently takes it really seriously. I drove up assuming it was the guy from earlier and as I passed I heard yelling so I turn the car around. He pulls the stop sign they set up around 6pm in front of my car and proceeds to beat on hit yelling at me that ,\" WE HAVE THIS SIGN FOR A REASON, THE SPEED LIMIT IS 15 MPH, AND YOU NEED TO STOP EVERY TIME\".\n\n I proceed to tell him that I didn't know he wanted me to stop, I assumed it was the other guy that waves me through. He tells me ,\"well I'm not him and I didn't, we've told you guys before about this (first I've ever heard of it) and I have half a mind to call your boss and get you fired\". I told him that if he felt so passionately about this he should call right now (I know I shouldn't have egged him on, I was just pissed he was yelling at me for something so minor). He did end up calling, but I didn't even get written up because this is basically the first complaint I've ever had against me since I started at this store. I wish I had told him that if he wanted people to stop, 1. the rules should be more uniformly enforced, 2. the stop sign should block the path, and 3. he should get out of his chair and flag me down like the only guard (that I'm aware of) that makes it super obvious she wants you to stop.\n\nI understand the rule is in place to keep tabs on who is coming and going for safety reasons, but really? trying to get me fired when I know nearly all of them by name, delivered to them, and have generally been around them for so long seems a bit far.",

        "text": "So it turns out that pizza delivery isn't as glamorous as it sounds. Sure, you make more than minimum wage after tips, but it all goes into your car so you can keep working a shit job, causing you to save only $2000 after seven fucking months. And on top of this, imagine you have school everyday from 7;00 in the morning to 5;00 in the after noon. then you work 6;00 to 10;00.\n\nSo hows that history paper coming. Oh, right, gotta go to work. Might fail the class even though you know the material. Nice. How about your morning classes working with mills and lathes? Yeah, if you fall asleep right now, you. will. die. That, and all your parts are out of tolerance because you're trying to make them on 4 hours of sleep after you try to write something coherent for History. Might have to retake those classes next semester if all your parts are shit.\n\nI had enough. I stepped back, took an objective look at my situation, and said \"this job is just not worth it.\"\n\nOH!! One more thing!! After you try to make it to work on time, and school on time, and just get through both of them, you get to have a fleeting dream of what a social life is before you collapse into unconsciousness. I'm not even going to call it sleep at this point. Because, you know, when you're not working, you're at school, and vice versa. Since the semester started, I haven't had a full day off (except for Thanksgiving) the entire time. Turns out that four months of nonstop school and work can really wear on a person.\n\nBut now, no matter the outcome of my classes (which I don't have very high hopes for right now), I know that I'll have some freedom back. Hell, I can sleep in until sunrise like a madman. I can have two days a week to rest, living like a king.\n\nI can be a person again.\n\nI don't have to deal with creepy guys in hotels who I'm pretty sure wanted to rape me. I don't have to be \"grateful\" for your $0.50 tip. I don't have to deal with people who assume I'm out to get them because the last guy kept my pen. (Swear to God, if I have to put on a fake smile one more time I get yelled at because THEY forgot something on their order, I will literally use that smile to rip their trachea out of their throat, and cram their order down the bloody hole as they die.)\n\nI can have my sanity back. I think it may have run a bit far, but I can have the time to find it again.\n\nI can find another shit minimum wage job if I need to, but no matter where I go, I bet I can solve any issue (let me rephrase that. \"issue\") they have without having to drive around for another half hour.\n\nFuck pizza delivery\n\nFuck Domino's\n\nFuck the expectation of \"If you aren't working while you're in school, you're doing it wrong\"\n\nI just want to focus on school, and get my degree, and get a job that isn't shit, and make more than what I do now. By the way, I got my paycheck today. It was $161 and change, because we depend on tips for income, and no one ever fucking tips because this is a poor fucking city in a poor fucking state, and fuck everyone.\n\nBut I can let it all go now, because in two weeks, I'll be free.\n\nAnd then I'll order brownies at 1:58 am to be a passive agressive asshole who wants brownies at 2 in the morning.

        "text": "Today was a pain in the ass. With the big 50% off deal going on, my store has been super busy, as have a lot of stores, I'm certain. I'll now share two stories from today.\n\nClose to my store is a bridge that goes over an interstate highway. The road that feeds this bridge goes through an intersection with two lanes, and then narrows to one right before the bridge. Like so\n\n\\______________\n\n-----------   _________\n\n______/\n\nMost people crossing the bridge just queue in the left lane before the light, because they know that it narrows down to the left lane. I almost always go to the right lane because it's shorter and I'll have a shorter wait through the light. Today, someone decided that zipper merges were for suckers, and they needed to be 3 feet off the bumper of the person in front of them. My only options were to slam on my brakes and hope I don't get pinched between the narrowing guardrail and the other driver, or just keep going and hope that the other driver's remaining brain cell activates, and they brake, letting me in. I choose the second, and luckily make it through without any further incident. I call my manager to let them know they're likely to soon get a call/complaint about me, and describing the situation. \n\n\nStory two: I was sent on a triple delivery, the first with 5 pizzas and 3 2 liters to a hotel. I get to the hotel, and all the way to the room at the end of the hall on the second floor, but they won't answer their door. I'm in the heavy winter domino's gear, and have to trek back to stairs to get back to the ground floor with all the product. I get to the lobby and ask if anyone ordered pizza. \"Oh, that's us!\" I hand it over, and have them sign, and say something along the lines of \"I called from your door, I was about to just take it back\" \"Oh, that was you? We get a lot of telemarketing calls from your area code, so we just ignored it\"\n\nMotherfucker, you ordered pizza, and before the pizza arrived, you got a phone call. Who the fuck else did you think was calling you? Fucking santa claus? Answer your goddamned phone when you order pizza, holy shit, this pisses me off so much.\n",

        "text": "So I'm a driver for one of the big chain stores. Been working here for a little over a year. Our store is a Fairley low volume store in terms of how much business we receive. Today, we got swamped outta nowhere. I'm talking about just tons and tons of deliveries and carry-outs. My boss does this thing where if we ever get this busy and we have plenty of drivers working, he just keeps me inside as a csr because I can get things done better than most of the other drivers. Well, I pick up the phone and begin taking this lady's order. I'm always extremely polite whenever taking an order and delivering. Well, her address isn't going into the system. No matter what variation of spelling I try, the system won't recognize it. At this point, I have to tell the customer \" I'm sorry maam but the address isn't recognized, give me one moment and I'll have it cleared up\". And you guessed it, she flips out. She starts raising her voice saying \"well I order there for delivery every week! You must be new there!\". Of course, I have to politely chime In with \"actually maam I've been working here over a year, this is just a unique case\". So I mute the phone and eventually am able to get a manager over to figure it out. We have to trick the system into taking the address by putting the correct address in the delivery instructions area. \n\nSo we eventually get that cleared up. I ask for her card number because she wants to pay with a card, and she fires out the numbers faster than an auctioneer. I politely ask her to slow down for me so I can avoid making any mistakes. She tells me I'm being extremely rude and that she wants to talk to a manager after we're done. I let her know that she would have to call back in an hour or so. At this point she's furious. Apparently, one of our drivers got confused with the address situation and went to the wrong place. Turns out it was the lady's sisters house. Which is literally right next door.\n\nSo we get a call an hour later from the lady that placed the order. She's once again furious and asks to speak to a manager. I let her know that we've done all that we can physically do at this point and that our managers will only tell her what I've told her, but I'll get one for you maam.\n\nI put down the phone, look over at my manager on the make line and tell him she wants to talk, and he tells me to handle it. Guess what?? I technically was a manager for a few months before I dropped myself back down to a driver (too many hours plus college is weird at this place, idk). So I pick the phone back up and tell her my qualifications, and she's still furious and I tell her that this is literally all we can do for her if she's already received the pizza (which she did after walking next door to her sisters place). She demands the corporate number. I give her the number and she hangs up. All I can do at this point is laugh it off. All corporate is going to do is send us a complaint through the computer and we're going to ban her from getting pies delivered to her. \n\nWell that's it really. If you made it this far, thanks for reading!!",

I grab my hotbag and give do the standard pleasantries, tell him his total, hand him his food, etc. He hands me two twenty dollar bills and I grab my change and assume I'm not getting a tip. I ask him how much he wants back and he says \"Nah man you good, keep the rest.\" Of course I'm a bit shocked so I ask him if he's sure, remind him he handed me two twenties, and tell him that I have change, etc. \"Nah man you have a good night :)\" \n\n\nSo of course I'm pretty happy, still a bit creeped out from the area and the situation itself though.

What obligation do I have in this situation? I mean I guess it's only $10, but I don't like this kind of precedent being set. This is the first time something like this has happened to me in 9 months of delivering. ",

Pull up to an apartment complex on (insert name of notoriously fratty street) and climb up to the 3rd floor and knock on the door, dude-man yells from the inside to come in but i refuse as its against policy and im really not trying to get robbed. They continue to yell for me to let myself in but i tell them i wont. This is when things go south, the guy who ordered comes to the door and i greet him and give him the receipt to sign, but from behind him i hear \"Why didnt you just come in you fucking faggot?\" This put me in a pretty pissed off state and I scream back at the guy in the back \"What did you just say?\" To which he replies again \"why didnt you just come inside you fucking faggot?\" Now i get dealing with angry customers and being yelled at but being verbally harassed is another thing (especially when its about pizza) so i take all of their food (roughly $25) and toss it off the 3rd floor balcony, tell them to learn some respect and leave (whilst dude man and his posse are all yelling at me and are now all calling me a faggot and telling me they'll get me fired). I didnt get fired, my boss told them off and i continued with my night. Enjoy being scum for the rest of your lives dudes. \n\nYall have ever had to deal with shit like that?",

        "text": "This is so bizarre that I had to post it somewhere.\n\nI live in NYC so there are pizza places everywhere, but my guilty pleasure is the large chain pizza. Tonight I ordered, but the events that unfolded were almost unreal. The place knows me well because I like to tip well, and usually they'll send my pizza out first. I get the usual call from the driver that he's outside so I go get the pie. I check the label on the box to make sure it's my name on the side and all is good.\n\nI bring the pie inside and due to my impatience I half open the box, pull out what I'm guaranteed as an amazing slice, and barely get a glance before I take a huge bite. As I'm savoring the different flavors it occurs to me that what I'm expecting (Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Onions) is not what I'm experiencing which turned out to be ham and pineapple. I flip open the box and find a pie that is half ham/pine and half olive/green pepper. My first thought was \"..but I checked it..\" so I look again at the label. Yup, still my name there. They must have misslabled it. I understand mistakes happen, I wasn't upset but I was sad because now I had \"ruined\" someone else's order by biting into it..     ...or did I?\n\nI place a quick call back to the driver and reported the mix up. He said he was on his way back. I began to fill with dread as I would have to explain to him that I had already half-eaten a slice (Yes, the bite was that big) and ruined the customers order. When he arrived, I remorsefully presented him with the box, showing him the half-eaten slice. I confessed that I was so hungry, I ate before looking and that I was deeply sorry. I had expected some kind negative emotion from the driver, as I had just made his work harder. I had also expected that he would either tell me to keep the order that I had soiled or take it back to the store. None of these things happened.\n\nThe driver proceeded to take my actual pie out of his delivery bag, and open it for inspection. After confirming that it was indeed the correct one he looked back at the pizza. I was in shock as I watched him reach into my pie and pull out a slice and put it into the other pizza box. The slice he took was expertly picked as it was mostly covered with cheese, masking the toppings from view. Unfortunately, the chosen slice was not cut all the way through, so in his haste to remove it, the tip of the slice remained attached to the remainder of my pie. When he fit the slice into the other customers pie, there was an obvious gap where the tip of the slice is supposed to go. I thought \"What are we supposed to do now\"?\n\nThen things go from bad to worse. He motions at the remainder of the slice tip still in my pie and says \"Would you mind? My hands are not so good..\" I didn't know what else to do... It was an awkward situation enough and I thought \"well, he knows what he's doing.. I guess\"? So I rip the slice tip from my pie, and proceed to set it in the gap of the other customers pizza. I was aghast. I couldn't believe that I had my hands in someone elses pie.. \n\nWe closed the lids to the pies and swapped stickers, both knowing the sins we had committed.  I felt dirty, though I'm not certain he did. His expertise in organizing the swap made me believe that this was not the first time that this had happened. The sickening came to me as I went back inside, knowing what was headed for the other customer. I looked down at my pizza, 7 of the slices I ordered and a half eaten slice that belonged to some poor fellow who was shortly receiving a tainted pie. 7 of the slices he ordered, and 1 slice that was mushed into places, broken tip and all.\n\nNeedless to say the guilt was too much and I had to call the store and report it to the shift-lead. They offered another pie but I didn't take it. I felt terrible about the incident, but I couldn't help but think about the poor soul on the other end of that dirty slice.\n",

Well it specifically states not based on personal preference. \n\nWell tonight I get called over from an Instore employee asking what she should do. I answer the phone and the lady says she didn't like the taste of the Pan sauce on the pizza. Can she get one with original. I said yes and gave her 50% off and said total with deliver will be $8.75(or something like that). \n\nShe says \"uh no I get a free one\"\nMe- Sorry the quality guarantee is only for mistakes made by us but I gave you a discount due to the circumstances. \n\n\"Um no the other girl said it was free\"\n\nMe-\"she came and asked what to do and like I said unfortunately we can't do that\"\n\nShe hangs up. Calls back asking for customer service. \n\nI get a call 15 minutes later. \n\"Yeah this is medallia. We have a complaint that you were rude and wouldn't send a replacement pizza for the one she can't eat. \n\n1. I wasn't rude\n2. It sucks but sometimes we don't like the food we try\n3. This isn't the first time, just the first time I caught this customer before it was run through. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I wrong? I can't keep making my drivers deliver free food for no reason. Plus I'm also looking at it like this. It's pizza. Someone will eat it because it's perfectly fine. They are simply trying to get additional food for free for no reason.\n\nLet me know. Either way big honcho is gonna ride my ass. Damned if I do. Damned if I don't. \n\nEdit- so GM is all pissy. He had to deal with the complaint. Apparently she got a full refund and free pizza through corporate. Says I should just give customers free pizza if they call back. Whatever\n\nAnyone who wants free pizza come to papa johns!!! Until next time. Peace guys. ",
