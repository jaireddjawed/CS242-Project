        "text": "For those of you who don't know \"Doing the videogame thing\" is a term where a player inadvertently or on purpose respects the boundaries that a game sets for them at a time. Basically the brain, after playing so many different videogames, is basically wired to go \"Oh, that door can't be accessed now, your lockpicking/hacking skill isn't high enough, move on\" or \"Oh, this pathway is blocked and you don't have the required strength to pass through it, move on\"  or \"Oh, that platform's too high to reach, move on\" It's these little things that your gaming brain goes \"The game doesn't want you to be here yet, move on\"\n\nHowever, Prey isn't a \"videogame\" videogame. Not even by a long shot and i've had to loose and forget about so many \"Doing the videogame thing\" habits that i have hardwired into my brain even with other RPG games like Fallout or Skyrim. Cause no, you don't need to do the videogame thing with Prey. \n\nHacking too low for the door? Well just break the nearby window and use your toy crossbow to hit the touch panel on the inside and let yourself in, or turn into a coffee cup and break through the broken window. \n\nStrength too low to move the objects standing in your way? Just use your Recycling grenade and turn the debris into crafting parts and move on through or, if you don't have one, just take an easier object to carry and throw it into the desk blocking the doorway till physics does it's thing and the desk falls away from the pathway\n\nPlatform too high to reach? Fucking make platforms with your glue gun and Super Mario your way up there my man, sky's the limit when you make your brain stop doing the \"Videogame thing\"",

Since this is widely acknowledged I won't get into any sort of explanation.\n\nWhen Sony rebooted the series with God of War 2018, they made such changes drastic to the series that if Kratos hadn't been the playable character, no one would have made the connection to the original series (the inclusion of the Blades of Chaos is the only giveaway I can think of). I have two questions:\n\n1. Why did Sony go down this route? If they wanted a new entry in the series, why not keep the Ancient Greek setting?\n\n2. If they were dead-set on the Norse setting, why didn't they create a new IP and a new character? We would've gotten the exact same game sans the Kratos character and the Blades of Chaos weapon. Would the sales really have been significantly worse if they'd created a new IP?",

        "text": "This is a rant, mostly. \n\n###\n\nLook, I don't care if the game has counterplay for snipers, or if it depends on the map, or all these things people use to justify snipers' existence. \n\nWhat I care about is that it simply is not fun playing against it. It is so much funner playing in the mid/close range. Snipers, in my opinion, have forever ruined FPS games. \n\nI want a game where snipers are removed from the equation. Period. I don't care if they're severely nerfed. I don't care if there's a lot of ways to deal with them because **I don't have fun doing that**. I fucking hate that map design is completely stifled by snipers existing. I hate not being able to engage with someone who can engage me. I hate that \"but it takes skill\" is used to justify it, as if other playstyles don't also take skill. I hate that they ignore and invalidate movement and positioning because they can instantly kill you no matter where you are. \n\nBut there's apparently no one else who feels this way and I don't get why. There is, as far as I know, not a single active multiplayer FPS game that has no sniper/railgun function. The closest is Halo Infinite but there's still sniper rifles in it. The FPS I play the most is TF2, and even though Sniper is the most hated class in the game by far, nobody has made a no Sniper server. \n\nThis just tells me that nobody else hates the mechanic like I do and it's incredibly depressing. I feel like I'm alone. Like if I suddenly became a programming savant and made a perfect multiplayer FPS with no long range mechanics, nobody would care.\n\nSomeone please give me some perspective or something. It's turning me off from the genre. Why is there literally NO multiplayer FPS that has ZERO sniping whatsoever?",

        "text": "Recently, I picked up Modern Warfare 2 to play with my friends, and I discovered that the game does not feature a way to opt-out of cross-input gaming. Fundamentally, I just feel like controller players and mouse + keyboard players shouldn't be in the same lobby in a competitive situation.\n\nYet it's just becoming a 'normal' thing and it's really aggravating because it feels like not enough people are pushing back on it. Halo Infinite's competitive scene was [extremely favorable towards controller players](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/r3es60/accuracy_stats_for_kbm_vs_controller/?s=8), even on PC. Apex Legends is [experiencing the same issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/xupt80/92_of_the_top_25_pc_players_are_now_on_controller/) where the best of the best are heavily skewed towards controller.\n\nSo having played about 10 hours of Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer... the same exact same thing is happening with this game. It's a pretty big talking point on the subreddit and amongst the community, especially at higher levels of skill -- yet it's also something that is being more deeply embraced by developers.\n\nAnd on a certain level, I can totally understand why: it can add longevity to games with smaller communities, and it can allow people to play with their friends. But -- man, does it suck. It isn't enjoyable to witness someone practically aimbot you thanks to the overcompensation of modern tools. In general, it killed my love for Apex and I don't see myself playing Modern Warfare 2 for very long. \n\nSo I just wanted to bring up this growing trend and my distaste for it, and maybe get some opinions from other people. Is it good, is it bad, should we continue to just deal with it, or should we raise a stink every time it happens? It still seems to be in its infancy, but it was unheard of ~3-4 years ago, as far as I'm aware. That said, it's starting to creep its way into competitive game after competitive game, and it really is starting to look like a trend that I'm not very fond of.",

        "text": "I've always seen Yakuza 0 get praised as this 10/10 masterpiece and the best introduction to the iconic Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, so I had high hopes for the game. I could only play it this year, and honestly, **I'm incredibly disappointed**. There is stuff to love in this game, don't get me wrong. I do think a great game is hiding in there somewhere if we trim a lot of the fat, but **the game loves to waste your time**. If you have trouble keeping your attention on games that have bad pacing, it might not be for you.\n\nI'm writing this not with the goal of attacking the game and its fans, but to warn others who might have similar issues as me to not go in with such high expectations. The public opinion surrounding this game is so unanimous that I feel the need to push back on it a little if only to give a heads-up to others like me.\n\nSome spoilers ahead, but I'll try to &gt;!censor !&lt;them.\n\n**The great**:\n\n* Speeches about philosophy by mobsters are cool\n* Side quests are witty, fun and give the world some color\n* I really liked how the first chapter went. It started off with a bang, &gt;!great tension in the family, going through Dojima HQ and then a banger boss fight with Kuze!&lt;.  If they kept that up for the whole game + the combat held up better in the end, it would've been perfect.\n* Majima's introduction\n* Some of the twists near the end:&gt;!Oda being bat tattoo guy and Tachibana/Makoto being brothers!&lt;\n* Kamurocho as a setting is well accomplished and interesting.\n* Made me want to play 1/Kiwami\n\nHowever...\n\n**The bad**:\n\n* **The pacing is worse than a soap opera**. Tell the same story in half the time and it would be great.\n* The game features two protagonists. One of them is pretty dull, with stoic and mad being his only two emotions. The other is interesting and goes through a neat arc. But jumping between their disjointed stories ends up killing the pacing.\n* The story is focused around a small patch of land called \"The Empty Lot\". **I fundamentally do not care about real estate disputes. It is a boring thing to center a plot around.**\n* I finished the game with 50h on my save file. A good 12-14 of those hours are because I fell asleep two evenings while I was trying to make progress and it kept sticking me with tons of cutscenes between random errands.\n* Cutscenes breaking up gameplay. Pacing again. It's really bad, the cutscenes are often pointless and too long, and frequently repeat stuff we already know.\n* Characters show up, have a spotlight for 1/2 chapters, and then get killed off, having achieved little.\n* **The story goes in circles**.\n* Maybe it's me, but I didn't care about many of the characters. Stoically telling me your sad backstory isn't enough to make you endearing, sorry.  The constant stance shifting surrounding killing/not killing was odd too.  You're Yakuza, not Batman.\n* **The combat is incredibly dull** and one note. It's ok for short games, but there is so much repetition here that the goons on the street become unbearable (you get random encounters in the street, and they become too much). There's some basic QoL stuff missing too, like proper attack sequencing or not lowering the attack rate from off-screen enemies.  The average goon has so much health compared to the MCs that it becomes a massive slog. It's not hard, but time-consuming.\n* **I should not have to go through a fucking real estate mini-game to be able to level up my combat skill tree**! It shouldn't be a requirement to do that for the final chapter to be fun\n* The boss fights had great presentations but they went off the deep end with the health bars too.  Why am I smacking the captain around for minutes if the \"real\" fight I have to learn only starts when he goes down to heat mode at red health? They barely fight back before that!\n* &gt;!All Kuze and Awano did was get repeatedly owned by Kiryu. The final boss is the boring accountant. !&lt;\n* The ending &gt;!is a wet fart. !&lt;\n\nI can't emphasize how much the story doesn't progress.\n\n&gt;!Kiryu is getting chased by the Dojima family, then he isn't, then he is again, but he hides, oh he got found out, then a decree from Tojo that he couldn't be chased! Just kidding, he's public enemy #1 again.  Same with Majima, to a lesser extent. Who's Makoto Makimura? Oh he finds him, then turns out it's a different person, then he finds her. Escort mission, she's hidden, but oh she got kidnapped, escort again, goes missing, gets found, goes missing, gets found, gets kidnapped again.!&lt;\n\nGet on with it already! I don't care if a bum-ass lieutenant from a random family I never heard of decided to intervene if the story is just going back to the same state it was 2-3 chapters ago.  So much middle management as padding, even &gt;!Sagawa !&lt;was pointless in the end\n\nEven the ending pretty much &gt;!sets Kiryu back to where he was at the start of the game.!&lt; It's madness, the game just goes in circles for 40 hours.\n\nEven the things I like have a few asterisks. For example, I liked the side quests, but I only really did them in the first few chapters.  Given the urgency of the main plot and just overall seeing less of them, they're gone from the second half of the game for me.\n\nKamurocho is a great setting, but it starts feeling a bit empty too. I remember seeing restaurants a few times and going \"neat, I can heal\" only to realize it's only a facade and you can't go into 95% of the buildings.  The minigames were ok but I wouldn't play anymore than once.\n\n**I'm curious about the following entries**.   I want to know more about the things described in the epilogue, which sound 10x more interesting than The Empty Lot. And I'm hoping 1 MC instead of 2 makes it more focused and better-paced.  But given that this one has the best reputation, I'm not very optimistic.",

        "text": "I was casually browsing YouTube when a new IGN clip was recommended in my feed for a game called Blight Survival. The thumbnail preview looked interesting so I clicked. \n\nIt opened up with a message about the following being “pre alpha gameplay footage not representative of the final product” suggesting this was some rough first pass. The next 5 or so odd minutes instead looked like something approaching the polish and cinematic realization quality of a GOTY title from a AAA powerhouse like Rockstar or Naughty Dog.. \n\nA million red flags immediately fired off in my head. First of all, as a professional sound designer I can promise you the entire audio itself is done in post on a linear timeline and there isn’t a single truly “in game real-time triggered and 3D positioned sound” that I could distinguish. Who calls this actual gameplay? And how is it not questioned by major outlets like IGN?\n\nI look into the studio to see if I’m missing anything and I learn that it’s two people making the game. A programmer and an artist. They have NO history of ever releasing anything. It’s become immediately obvious to me that in actuality there might not even be ANY true gameplay ready at all. It’s a cinematic produced in Unreal, that doesn’t make it gameplay. At least be honest with the world and call this some sort of target gameplay benchmark or something.. don’t bullshit us with deceptive terms like “pre alpha gameplay” that trick people into thinking the core experience is already playable and in presentable shape. \n\nThe crazy part to me is that IGN shared this thing, followed by Gameranx and now millions of people have seen this and are expecting it to be a real thing that’s already nearly this far along in development. That’s insane! How is it not false advertising? How are IGN not doing their homework and checking if they should even be promoting this stuff? \n\nSo now any two random guys can get some money together, produce a crazy looking cinematic in unreal, call it “pre alpha gameplay footage” and then put their hands out asking for support as millions of excited gamers come rushing to throw cash at them even though they have no demonstrable proof of being able to ever deliver what they’ve shown? \n\nPeople get really outraged when a AAA studio has deceptive graphics downgrades but I can’t think of any major game studio that would have the balls to try pulling off something like this. There would be too many questions. They’d never get away with it. And this wouldn’t be the first time something like this has occurred in the indie space yet it’s always forgiven and pushed aside or treated like the “struggle for indie devs to make their dream a reality”. \n\nTo be clear, this isn’t meant to be hating the game itself or the devs. What I saw was fantastic and I would absolutely love to play it. I WANT it to be real. What disappointed me was seeing how fake and deceptive its gameplay reveal is and how 2 million people are out there excitedly anticipating it now.",

        "text": "I own Dishonored 1, 2 and Prey but haven’t found the time/motivation to fully commit to them. I know that I’m barely scratching the surface of these games but simply can not bring myself to play them just to reach the « fun part ».\n\nI bought Deathloop on its premise of cutting off the fat out of those games to focus on their main strengths and, like other Arkane games, ended up being lost a few hours in and putting it aside for something instantly more gratifying at the time.\n\nPicked it up yesterday, re-learned the mechanics and stumbled my way to the part where you can infuse your gear (for those who haven’t played it is making your upgrades permanent from one run to the other, effectively allowing you to build a load-out). It felt like I was finally playing the actual game and spent an entire afternoon glued to my screen.\n\nThe game now feels like a mix of Dishonored, Hitman, MGS V and Dark Souls and its really fucking addictive. I’m loving it, the loop structure - which felt punishing and well, repetitive in the beginning - has become so empowering that the game has become hard to put down.\n\nIt’s a bit of a spoiler but I really encourage anyone who put the game aside to try and (do this specific task in the game &gt;!kill Doctor Wenjie Evans!&lt; as soon as you feel ready for it, as this will allow you to save your progress in the future and reach the actual gameplay loop (no pun intended).\n\nI nearly missed out on this excellent game, simply because the information that I was given initially felt redundant (from being familiar with their other games) or at times overwhelming. Once everything fell into place however, it completely turned the game around.\n\nI’d also encourage potential players to play the game at their own pace. If you feel like your are missing essential information in the beginning, or are overwhelmed by the huge info dump that you have to go through, know that it will end up making sense earlier than you think and that the game goes from punishing to insanely rewarding from this moment onwards.",

        "text": "Something I notice over on mainstream subs such as r/gaming is that when things like quest markers, puzzles and such are discussed, there is a huge group who basically say \"No thanks, just give me the solution right away so I don't need to think and can just have fun. It's just meaningless busywork meant to drag out the game's length and is bad design\".\n\nWut? \n\nI think that my generation (I'm 33) have mostly always seen gaming as \"brain training\", and not just something for fun. As far as I remember, and my thoughts about games got more deep than \"yay video games are fun!\", me and my friends have always called games \"brain gymnasics\", because they really get the good ol' nogging going, and one of video game's advantages over movies is the opportunity to have the player as an active part of it all and really challenge your mind, both in reflexes but also a big part in logics, pattern recognition etc.\n\nTo me, solving a difficult puzzle in a game like Zelda, or figuring out where to go on a quest I've been stuck on for hours is far more rewarding than killing a boss, even if that can also be very rewarding if it's one you struggled on. The dopamine hit is like no other, within this medium at least.\n\nIs this an idea that becomes less and less important, though? I'd hate to see puzzles go, but it seems like the standard is slowly becoming to make puzzles easily bypassed, with games like Uncharted 4 having characters yell out the solution in like 30-60 seconds, should you not have solved it by then. \n\nGod of War: Ragnarök is supposedly even less patient with you and has the characters tell you what to do almost instantly. Supposedly you can turn it off through some menu tinkering, but I don't like that the standard is that the puzzle could as well not be there, and I wish instead it didn't tell you anything but there were options in the menus that you could toggle on for more help. I don't like how the developer assumes that the standard player is bad at solving puzzles and need help from the start.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "As a (casual) comic book reader, I've always considered the stylism of the medium as one of its core strength. It is my favorite part of comic books. [I love how artist use stylish onomatopoeia, dialogue placement, and creative paneling to show the action and story of the comic books.](https://imgur.com/a/FJJlpOu) I can spend minutes just looking at beautiful pages. Yet I notice that comic book video games do not reflect that. Spider-Man PS4, Arkham series, Midnight Suns, Gotham Knights, Suicide Squad: KTJL, and the Avengers games just have that generic realistic art direction like so many games have. They can look pretty of course (Especially Arkham Knight) but they all just start looking the same.\n\nThe popularity of Spider-Verse and the praise it got for its animation for bringing the comic book style into animated visual form makes me believe that there should be a video game equivalent of that. A game where the cutscenes are a mix of comic book panels and regular animation, where hitting enemies make onomatopoeias, the world and character models look like they came from a comic book, and the UI are comic book panels.\n\nThough there are actually already video games that try to do that even before Spider-Verse was released. Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension and the Telltale games try to emulate comic books using cell shaded models and its pretty cool (though not as good as Spider-Verse). So I'm referring more to a heavily marketed modern triple A game with animation as good and stylized as the Spider-Verse movie. Hopefully it sells well and Marvel and DC make more video games like it.\n\nNot saying that comic book video games can't have realistic art direction of course. I just want some that have comic book stylism. I mean there already are video games that do that I'm hoping we get a modern big budget one to transform comic book video games forever. Unique art direction gives games distinct identities and is appreciated by both critics and the average gamer. Persona 5 proves that.\n\nI've heard comments that a realistic art style is better at attracting customers but Borderlands is a pretty popular franchise and its designed to look like a graphic novel so that doesn't seem true.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/ym7c9y/opinion_doom_2016eternals_glory_kill_system/",
        "text": "A couple of things of note: \n\n- I'm boxing together glory kills with flame belches and chainsaw kills. Anything close range, that grants some form of resource (health, armor, ammunition). \n\n- This isn't a critique of the Doom reboots' quality. They are well made, with fantastic art/music direction, and fun gameplay. \n\nDoom has always had melee attacks. From the simple, brass-knuckled, punch, to the iconic chainsaw, to the occasional 'berserk' powerup. I'm not arguing that adding in anything tactile suddenly robbed Doom's status as a shooter. Clearly you still shoot. A lot. But I am arguing that the 'glory kill' system shifted its focus away from it far enough- to the point where the shooting is no longer the primary focus. And I think this change boils down to two, specific, intentions of the designers: the desire to instigate aggressive, \"push forward\" combat, and, the power fantasy of no longer being a 'Doomguy' but a 'Doom Slayer'. I'd like to look at each, and explain why I think this changed the DNA of Doom too much.  \n\nIt would be inaccurate to borderline blasphemous to say that Doom was never aggressive. Its life blood was built around the idea of drilling into the demon hordes by way of shotgun, rockets, and anything else dangerous enough to do the job. But there was always another element paired with that aggression: caution. Sometimes you couldn't just drill. Sometimes you had to take cover, retreat, dodge, line up some enemies for an in-fight, scour an earlier room for some health, or ammunition, etc. In short, your vulnerability demanded a sense of tactics. But, the devs wanted to propel you into those fights with reckless abandon. Cut you off from that caution. Because they wanted aggression. And the Glory Kill system was their solution. Now you're not looking for health pickups, Glory Kills are the health pickups. You're not looking for ammo, Glory Kills are your ammo. Sure you might dodge, but Glory Kills are safer, they have i-frames. Glory Kills became the beating heart of Doom's combat, and... they're not shooting. [As an aside, yes, of course the devs still do put health/armor/ammo drops in arenas, but, I do think it's safe to say that they aren't intended to be your main source of resources]  \n\nThe other side of this I don't think has anything to do with the nuts and bolts aspect of the gameplay, but rather, the game's overall fantasy: stepping into the armored boots of the Doom Slayer. He's big, green, pissed off- (wait, is he just the scifi Hulk?) and completely capable of wiping out anything in front of him. And we all know his number one commandment, \"Rip and tear until it is done.\" Now, real' quick- let me explain something. That phrase became associated with Doomguy in a comic. You can read up on it [here](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rip-and-tear). And the scene in question is... when he's under the influence of the 'berserk' powerup. Bare handed. This wasn't introduced as some sort of doctrine to what Doomguy is, but rather, a temporary bout of powerup induced, weaponless, rage. But the new devs took this fantasy and pretty much ran as far as they could with it. Doom Slayer rips and tears anything with sharp teeth and a bad attitude. You can almost feel his muscles pulse with power as he's shredding appendages and gouging holes into places where there aren't any. But again, that's not shooting. That's shifting gears into something entirely different. An entirely new fantasy that to me- just isn't Doom. Doom was about the shooting first. But now, shooting's just a warmup, a key to the real payoff: Glory Kills.  \n\nThings change. Things evolve, and I'd imagine that's probably what a lot of people will say. That the series just took a different turn. And you know? I don't think there's anything wrong with that. The change, or, that opinion. Like I said in the beginning, they didn't make a bad game. They didn't even add something that was never there before. Doom's always had punching, and sawing, and just going berserk. It was the proportion, and the focus of it all, that changed. And I personally think, that that proportion changed the combat too much, to where Doom isn't really about the shooting anymore.",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nTo begin with, I would just like to express my profound thankfulness for the attention my post about Sonic the Hedgehog received a couple of days ago; I apologize for not having been super involved with the discussion that took place in the comments.\n\nAlright, regarding this post, I want to try to delve into my conflicted preferences regarding linear and exploratory gameplay; something I should understand is that such, uh, “genres”, are not - well, as dependent upon the specific video game - as arbitrarily clean cut as I might want to to think that they are.\n\nFor reference, the examples I’ll use will pretty heavily lean more towards platforming(ish) games, so I don’t know how, um, “malleable” my thoughts could be towards genres I’m not quite as familiar with, such as RPGs or Shooters.\n\n**Regarding Linearity**\n\n- Ok, my immediate thought is to state that I most certainly prefer the video games I play to be largely linear; I like having a structure to follow and specific tasks to follow as it makes for, uh, “controlled fun”.\n\n- …It’s likely that the overwhelming majority of gamers grew up playing Super Mario games in some form or capacity, but yeah, redundant as it might be to state, Super Mario was of great gaming interest to me when I was a kid; my fondness for linear gameplay most likely resulted from my enjoyment of the focused platforming challenges that are generally associated with “classic” Mario.\n\n- However, I guess that what I tend to struggle with it comes to certain instances of linear gameplay is when I am made to go about tasks within said linear progression at a pace I am uncomfortable with, be it being forcibly railroaded into speedy set pieces or forced to a slow, uninvolved crawl.\n\n- This can be the case for The Legend of Zelda games, such as Twilight Princess or Skyward Sword, when excessive tutorials are baked into menial gameplay tasks— which is not to discredit Nintendo for making their modern games increasingly more accessible; it’s an honorable philosophy, but I’d appreciate ways to circumvent the mandatory “training wheels”.\n\n**Regarding Exploration**\n\n- If there is a type of exploration in video games that I do find myself enjoying, it’s a more *contained* form of exploration; this can consist of a greater emphasis on interior spaces with rooms and corridors or having side-off exploratory areas along the main road.\n\n- This *contained* exploration is why I appreciate Metroid games so much— the world is not a vast, open space that would only do more to overwhelm or bore me, but it’s a more structured and focused interior complex of interconnected, contained spaces; plus, I tend to find the atmosphere of Metroid’s contained, interior worlds much more *comforting* than the open air of a given RPG game.\n\n- Thus, when it comes to vast, open spaces in which everything is available all at once and there’s minimal structure, I find myself being a swinging pendulum between feeling overwhelmed about how to go about certain tasks and feeling underwhelmed with the more menial tasks that come with these open spaces in themselves.\n\n- To bring everyone’s favorite online video game discussion topic back— Again, I grew up playing the much more scripted, linear Sonic the Hedgehog games that revolved around the Boost mechanic, which made it challenging for me to get into and even understand the open-ended nature of the classic games’ sprawling 2D levels; I think I do now understand the philosophy behind classic Sonic thanks to YouTube and otherwise, but still approach the game with taking a preferred, straightforward path.\n\nPlease, what are the thoughts and feelings of this community regarding this subject matter?\n\nThank you.",

But at the same time, I do want to play through the games. **Are there youtube channels that specifically focus on this? I remember TotalBiscuit had a series similar to this back in the day.** He'd have \"first impression\" videos on how to properly play the game. He'd take you through the menu system/upgrade system and hold your hand along the way. **He'd basically explain all the boring parts to you so that when you actually sit down to play the game, you can focus on the fun.**\n\nIs there anything similar to that in this day and age?",

I knew the games were beloved by the fanbase (feelings which I now share), and being a pc gamer I could always emulate it, but I didn't really want to get through the hassle of setting up an emulator and finding a rom only to play what people always told me was a QTE simulator. I was always curious, don't get me wrong, but not curious enough, as I had other famous and long-running franchises I always wanted to get my hands on (Metal Gear Solid, Kingdom Hearts, etc.) to play first.\n\nOut of nowhere however, the remaster came out and I took the chance to finally play it, and I was pleasantly surprised: not only do the games not feel like they're from 1999 (Tomb Raider 3/ Metal Gear Solid/ Half Life/ Ocarina of Time were the games I had in mind) and 2001 (Gta 3, Metal Gear S 2, Jak and Daxter) but they're also the most unique games I've ever played. I don't want to be here and wanking myself while praising the game. Look, if you love narrative focused games such as Quantic Dreams' or Telltale's or Life is Strange then this is really, really up your alley.\n\nInfact, the Shenmue games don't feature much gameplay apart from some fun minigames, some QTEs (but not too many after all) and a combat system that, while it's really good, it isn't really used that much. These games really are just mostly about going to a place and actually visiting it: it's difficult to explain, but in a normal open world game, even in the best ones, a street is just a street and a building is just a building you'll spot once and you'll never see again after completing all the missions and collecting all collectibles, and, if you know videogames, you know there's actually nothing inside these buildings, they're just there for the scenery; Empty boxes. In linear games this feeling is even worse as you maybe see something you'd love to explore in the distance but oh, your main character, capable of accomplishing inhuman feats and slaughtering thousands of guys, isn't capable of jumping over a fence in the same way you could.\n\nWell, shenmue is really good at creating the illusion of a living world where every door can be knocked at, every shop visited, every person spoken to. By the end of the adventure, you'll know the places you've visited, the names of the streets, the personalities of all the people you've spoken to, and you'll feel like you've traveled through actual places. You'll also make good friends along the way; for example, one of my favourite thingsì to do was playing darts or pool with people in bars at night. It does help that most places you visit are accurate virtual counterparts of real existing places, that the weather behaves in a realistic way (e.g. snow actually changes the landscape, instead of just being white rain) and the big amount of cutscenes are 1) in engine and 2) feature good Japanese voice acting, however the English voice acting is DREADFUL, STAY AWAY. Also, in most occasions, you can skip dialogue like in an RPG.\n\nThe story is good and the game is fun, but certainly it is more about deep immersion and way less about the dopamine induced gameplay loop of a repetitive multiplayer game. So, if your favourite game is Rocket League or Fortnite, stay away. However, if you love or wanted to try \"Telltale\" types of games (especially now that the studio has closed its doors) and you always wished they featured a little bit more of a REAL gameplay rather than them being interactive cutscenes, then Shenmue is going to be exactly for you as it was for me.\n\nP.S. Don't listen to the videos both Videogamedunkey and Stirling did on the games, as they almost convinced me to not try them. If you can, play the game on pc and be sure to patch it; it's the only version that supports 4k and it's the only version that support mods, which are necessary. Not only there are hd texture mods for characters and models which make the game looks really nice, but there are also widescreen mods for cutscenes: yes you heard that right, unfortunately some cutscenes in the first Shenmue are PILLARBOXED, wereas most cutscenes in Shenmue 2 are BOTH PILLARBOXED AND THEN LETTERBOXED, which is pretty immersion breaking. Thankfully you can remove these with a mod, and the game actually plays really nice with the new aspect ratio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "It seems that lately there has been a trend in online games in the form of time-gated activities. These are rewarding little things that the player can do only a limited amount of times per day, or week, or month, etc.\n\nWhile those activities are seen mostly on MMORPGs, even games like League of Legends or Overwatch often feature them (in the form of \"first win of the day\" rewards). The reason why developers add them is pretty obvious. Online games rely on player's addiction, and this addiction can often go away simply by spending a day or two without playing them. Having these features encourage players to make sure they play at least a little bit each day, keeping them addicted to the game.\n\nWhether or not this is an ethical thing to do on part of the developers is a discussion for another day. I'm here to ask if this game design philosophy is actually harming the games they're in. Recently the developers of Oldschool Runescape were asked about this matter on a Q&amp;A stream, as OSRS has relies far less on these sort of activities than Runescape 3 (here's a list of daily/weekly/monthly activities in [OSRS](http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/Repeatable_events) and [RS 3](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Repeatable_events), to put things in perspective). They answered that this is not the sort of game design that they're aiming for, as it's a big slippery slope to make the game feel like a list of chores that the player feels obligated to do each day.\n\nWhat do you think about this matter? Is this sort of game design actually good, or just turns a game into a giant mess filled with instant gratification activities to fuel players' addiction?",

        "text": "Currently, I am on the hunt for a good 4x game. I love the thought of building my empire, exploring the world, and being immersed in it, but every game I try fails to grab me. Maybe part of it is intimidation with learning how to play, but I think more of it is that I like the Idea of the game and not the game itself.\n\nSomething like Dwarf Fortress seems like the perfect match. It simulates the entire history of the world, and you get to build and manage a fortress. Seems perfect for what I am looking for, but it could never actually grab me. Maybe it is a bad first example, since the learning curve is pretty high, but I find it the same with most other games too.\n\nI just started up stellaris, which I've played for about 10 hours in the past, and I just could not get into it. Same thing with Civ V (which is closer to 100 hours)\n\nIt's not just 4x games either. I always start RPGs, but never get too far into them. I got out of the prison in Divinity Original Sin 2, and haven't played since. I've tried to start The Witcher 3, three different times now, and never got past the second area, even though it seemed like a really fun game. Especially the large monster fights. Megaquarium looked like so much fun. Something to build your own aquarium? Sounds perfect, since I love the sea. \n\nAgain, it all goes back to that Idea of a game. What the game actually plays as sounds amazing, and I can't wait to try it, but when I do try it, it just doesn't keep my attention. I love watching youtube videos of the games - Playthroughs, guides, tutorials - But when it comes to actually sitting down, and playing it, I just can't do it most of the time.",

It has an [API](https://www.mobygames.com/info/api)^1, though I'm not sure how much could be done with the data it has(it seems rather divorced from genres and traits of things).\n\nAsking for recommendations rarely yields anything, because if I don't know about a game, the people who do are usually too rare to expect to encounter.\n\nAAA games usually show up if you browse any kinds of news and discussions, but I usually don't, since that's a lot of effort per game learned about, and I tend to have no interest in AAA games besides.\n\n------\n\nBasically, I feel like there *have* to be at least some worthwhile games out there, that I'm unlikely to ever discover, and I'd really like to.\n\nI'm not really making this as a suggestions thread, though if you have any worthwhile games you don't think anyone else is likely to have heard of, I would welcome it (and hope that so would/will the mods)\n\nSorry for not asking any more specific questions, but I am really not the best at conversing and discussing things.\n\n^1 I've thought about making an improved game discovery platform for Steam using the [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/about) API, which includes some info(user-defined tags with votecounts for one) that the main Steam API does not have, including an API request to fetch the entire complete collection of things on Steam, but being a dysfunctional person, never got around to it.

        "text": "Ubisoft's openworlds are graphically pretty, but it's hardly specific to their games. They are often mocked as being kind of clunky and repetitive from a gameplay perspective, and all identical. What's more is that their stories are often mediocre. Nonetheless, Ubisoft seems to have a surprisingly successful formula, and almost nobody's copying them.\n\nIt's surprising because instead of systematically chosing a setting which proved to be great marketing wise, such as WW2, Post-Apocalyptic world, Sci-Fi, or medieval fantasy, they often take place in original settings that are completely at odds with the lack of gameplay risk. AC series explored the near Near East during the crusades, Florence, Rome, Venice and Constantinople during the Renaissance, Boston during the war of Independance, Paris during the Revolution, Industrial London, Ancient Egypt, soon Ancient Greece; Ghost Recon Wildlands recreated a mini Bolivia; STEEP recreated actual mountains and valleys from the Alps and Alaska. Far Cry went to Africa, fictional Nepal and Montana. Far Cry Primal even takes place during the Prehistory, characters speak in a recreated dead language and the hero runs after the venus of Willendorf in his dream. \n\nIn my own playthroughs, it seems that as a result, the best moments in these Ubisoft games are never the strongest moments of the story or the gameplay, unlike in most games, but casual contemplative side moments: taking an helicopter and going to the highest snowy mountain in GRW, then going to the Salar de Uyuni in motocross. Removing the minimap and just walking at night in the forest alongside a sabertooth tiger in Far Cry Primal. Riding a camel in AC origins without a goal and finding out the natron village, or first entering Sainte Chapelle in AC Unity. That gives exactly the same kind of feeling as when you are on hollidays somewhere. Heck, I went to Sainte Chapelle IRL because of Unity.\n\nWhy don't other similar risk-adverse big publishers (the EA, ZeniMax or Activision Blizzard of the world) try to go for similar original but real settings?

        "text": "Within the Pokemon franchise, the second generation (Which I'll call GSC for short) had probably the biggest emphasis on worldbuilding. GSC actively go out of their way to create a rich, believable world for the player to explore, as opposed to the more immediate and narrative-centered approach of the later games. What I want to do in this post is explain why I think it's great, and also why I think it's important to the player's enjoyment of Pokemon specifically.\n\nIn GSC, there's a realtime clock that keeps not only the current time, but also the day of the week. This function is extremely important in making the world feel alive; certain NPCs and pokemon are constantly following their own schedules independently of the player. Missed that important radio broadcast earlier today? Well, sorry pal, you actually missed it. Better check the schedule at the radio station to find out when the next broadcast will be. Want to finally catch Lapras and complete your pokedex? Well, pokemon *that* rare don't just jump out at you in shallow water. You're gonna have to dig deep, find knowledgeable people for hints, and be in the right place at the right time. Need an evolution stone? Well, those are pretty rare, better seek out someone who might know where to find one. *Maybe,* if you're lucky or astute enough, you can figure out the best time and location to get one, or a friend will give you a call and help you out. It forces you to take the game on its own terms and wrangle victory from its hands; the world has consistent rules and exists whether the player is there to experience it or not. It also makes NPCs feel more alive when they nervously ask for your phone number and proceed to call you at inconvenient times just to chat, or request a rematch, or give you a gift. Time matters in a well-built world, just like in real life.\n\nIn Pokemon, and in RPGs in general, there are typically two relevant time periods: the ancient past, and the very recent past. The ancient past provides some legend, relic, or mystery that ties into the player's destiny, while the recent past provides the driver of conflict in the present. We see this setup in almost all post-GSC pokemon games, where recently-formed evil teams awaken some type of ancient power to achieve their quirky goal; the time between ancient and modern is almost always glossed over, and the game world is usually little more than a shallow facsimile of a real place. The world in GSC is a little more lived in by comparison. The player meets older people who describe drastic changes to the world a few decades before the events of GSC; not all that recent, but certainly not ancient. The invention of pokeballs, the burning of the tower in Ecruteak, and the disappearances of Ho-oh and Lugia, are all within living memory. You'll meet people who knew important figures when they were growing up, or witnessed important events years ago. These interactions aren't part of a mandatory sequence of events, they're just people who live in Johto making conversation. You'll also meet people who tell you old wives' tales about pokemon; that a giant Bellsprout became their sacred tower, that it rains when slowpoke yawns, or that Lugia kidnaps misbehaving children. These stories give the people of Johto cultural connections to pokemon and the world itself that feel more developed than in any other game in the franchise and show, rather than tell, that the world has existed continually throughout time.\n\nThe ancient past is also portrayed a little more realistically in GSC. There's an area in the game called the Ruins of Alph, where stone engravings cover the walls and mysterious puzzles make strange pokemon appear. There's no all-important prophecy, no illustration showing crucial plot events, and no magical artifacts to find; it's an ancient religious site where pokemon were worshiped, near as we can tell. That's all. In Crystal a side story was added where the ruins have some tenuous connection to the legendary pokemon Suicune, but it isn't expanded on too much because, as in real life, our knowledge of the past is limited by what scientists can dig up. This is something very important to a well-built world: not all secrets can be knowable. Not all legends are true, not every ruin has some well-documented story, and not all information survives the ravages of time. This isn't the only unknowable secret, either, and not all of them concern the ancient past. What *did* happen to Giovanni after the Rockets disbanded? It's frequently discussed by his followers, but an answer is never given. Where do pokemon eggs come from? Why do Clefairy dance under the full moon? The game understands that some things are better left to players' theories, and that interesting worlds have mysteries that cannot necessarily be solved.\n\nSo why does any of this matter? And really, is what I'm describing even \"good design?\" Some of the time-based mechanics will definitely be despised by some players, and plenty of others will probably ignore the \"flavor text\" and just grind their Typhlosion instead- so why bother? Well, because the entire value of fantasy worlds is what they can show us about our own- and the value of fantasy people and creatures is *what they can show us about ourselves.* The deeper the parallels between our world and the game's world, the more meaning, and enjoyment, can be derived from the game's events. Why save a boring, pleasant, lifeless world? Why dig deep into a remote cave that holds no secrets? Why call an NPC that can't call back? The inclusion of these things is the difference between a game you play once or twice, and a game you cherish for life because it *made you feel something.* Pokemon is supposed to be about the bond between us and our pets, and for that relationship to drive interesting gameplay, the world *needs* to be fleshed out and keep us learning as we explore.\n\nSo, I hope I've explained in sufficient detail why I love the worldbuilding in GSC so much more than other Pokemon games. I would love to hear some thoughts from everyone else on this.",

        "text": "I've been playing the 2016 DOOM reboot for the past couple weeks and am maybe 8 hours into the main campaign (seems like it's heading towards the end). It's been a rollicking good time for no shortage of reasons, but it also struck a chord that's been particularly resonant for me as of late - narrowly focused and thematically consistent game mechanics.\n\nIt reminds me of Yoshihiko Ikebata's quote:\n\n&gt;Luigi’s Mansion is really a game about using the vacuum, and how much fun it is to use that to suck things up.\n\nAnd on the surface that sounds kind of funny, but really the entire game does revolve around that core mechanic, and it feels like the art, the gameplay, and even some of the tech, is built around that one thing, and your primary way of interacting with the world is based on it.\n\nDOOM, as far as I can tell, is about 'ripping and tearing.' Just a quick primer for those who may not be familiar - DOOM is a soft reboot of the original Doom from 1993, and is an FPS about killing demons that have essentially invaded Mars following a misguided corporate attempt to harvest Hell for energy.\n\nUnlike most modern FPS games, there is no aim-down-sights and very few enemies with hit-scan weapons. Rather, it's all about shooting, moving, and dodging projectiles and enemy attacks. The primary mechanic besides that is called the 'Glory Kill.' Enemies that have sustained certain amounts of damage will stagger and glow, at which point you can click the right stick to jump in and literally rip and tear the enemy apart. This results in a shower of health for you to pick up.\n\nWhat this means is that the gameplay loop encourages you to play more aggressively and essentially do more ripping and tearing to stay alive. If you run low on ammo, killing an enemy using the Chainsaw will give you a wealth of ammo instead of health, like a regular Glory Kill. Essentially, you can cycle between guns, glory kills, and the chainsaw to stay alive and armed.\n\nBy itself, that's a great little loop on its own. But what sets DOOM apart is how that concept of ripping and tearing finds its way into more than just the killing mechanics. The 'interact' button is the same as the melee button which is the same as the glory kill button. The implication is almost that the Doomslayer literally only interacts with his world by ripping, tearing, and killing.\n\nWhen you find a robot drone that offers weapon upgrades, you don't just pick it up - you snatch it and punch the robot away. There are numerous keys necessary to open doors and new passages, and the key cards are often attached to dead bodies (the Doomslayer rips them off the body) or sometimes you have to literally pick up a dead body and use their face for a retinal scan or the like to open doors. Even the simple concept of locked off areas has a rip-and-tear dynamic to it. The Doomslayer receives instructions from a mysterious robo-man, but he usually ignores explicit requests and smashes things up that are asked to be treated gently. The level design locks you into arenas to make sure you can't put too much distance between yourself and your enemies - you *have* to rip and tear.\n\nNow it's a bit of a double edged sword. On one hand, this makes the game feel supremely clean, focused, and satisfying to play. But it also means the game sometimes struggles to find variety since everything is so hyper focused on this one dynamic. Additionally, there a couple parts of the game - the RPG-lite upgrade system and secret hunting - that are totally antithetical to the power fantasy that the rest of the mechanics hold true to. (for an example of how a game can keep its thematic consistency even with something as banal as inventory and upgrades, see Resident Evil 4, which incorporates the 'survival' part of 'survival horror' into the attache case)\n\nWhat are some games that do this well? What are the advantages of *not* following this design philosophy (there certainly are some)?",

        "text": "It seems like every other month a new game launches that for whatever reason is lower quality than it deserves to be. Whether it's a rushed launch, budget cuts or poor development decisions, so many of our favorite games deserved so much more. What game are you still disappointed about?\n\nFor me it's a toss up between mass effect 3 and assassin's Creed unity. Both, even with their issues, as still 2 of my all time favorite games. \n\nEven ignoring the ending of ME3, so many corners had to be cut due to the short EA imposed launch date. After watching raycevick's videos on the mass effect series development, it makes me so sad what these games could have been if they were given the proper shot they deserve. I already love the characters and lore in the ME series more than any other game, I just hope one day we get a re-release with updated visuals and maybe restore some of the games cut content.\n\nAC unity still manages to be second only to ac2 (nostalgia mostly) on my favorite AC games list, even despite it's problems. Although I think something like Odyssey will be a fun game in it's own right, it's missing most of the elements that I enjoy out of an AC game. AC unity has the perfect setting, a gorgeous city, a higher focus on stealth (blade in the crowd type thing. Reminds me of the initial trailer for AC1), an established brotherhood order, etc. However as everyone knows it's fucking broken. The animations, while beautifully choreographed, sync terribly with the environment and npc's. Performance is all over the place with AA absolutely destroying the fps. There's still bugs with getting caught in the environment. NPCs are really buggy with awful ai. The combat is bad with really unresponsive controls. The story is a bit disjointed and bland. \n\nI really just wish both of these games had a fair shot without being rushed out the door by the publisher and obvious unfinished.

        "text": "Following the announcement of several features for the Nintendo Switch online service, such as cloud storage backup saving (the Switch does not permit you to move save data to an SD card for backup) and NES emulation, I started thinking back to the homebrew community which had been providing these features for free to Switch owners for some time already. \n\nIs it right, or even okay in your opinion, for Nintendo to be withholding a basic feature like the ability to back up your own data behind a subscription fee on a console you've already purchased (unofficial NES emulation, while perfectly legal with your own backups, is still understandably something Nintendo wouldn't want to support)? I understand that with upcoming Pokemon titles on the horizon, not allowing the user to access that save data in any direct manner is a priority; the Pokemon series is ripe for save modification and Nintendo has always striven (extremely unsuccessfully) to do away with modders there. Though, [Nintendo has always been rather lackluster with ensuring a cheat free online experience too...](https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/8yc8lq/cmon_nintendo/)\n\nA precedent has been set by their competitors as well however; Microsoft and Sony have no problem allowing users to backup their own data onto external USB devices. Microsoft even goes so far as to provide a free cloud storage option for all users, regardless of your Xbox Live subscription status. Is it just time Nintendo caught up with the rest of the industry, or do they have a justification?\n\nIt shocks me sometimes to see the negative reaction to homebrew across reddit. I can only assume it stems from a conflation with piracy, which, fair enough, the communities are often intertwined, no matter how much the homebrew scene and their developers often try to distance themselves from it.\n\nSo what's your take? How do you feel about homebrew in gaming? Is it something you think adds value to your console owning experience? Is it something you wish would just go away, or are you indifferent to it as long as it's used responsibly?",

(I know that the first response to that claim might be that I'm a 'keyboard-warrior' or 'SJW,' so you'll just have to take my word when I say I'm not doing this out of a sense of progressive thought).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the ongoing outrage in the gaming community over the perceived 'virtue signaling' (I think that's the right word for it) in Battlefield 5, with its inclusion and prominent depiction of women in what was, historically, an almost entirely male fought war, I feel like many gamers are angry at this, whilst perhaps deliberately ignoring (or just being less focused on) the fact that the previous game in the series, Battlefield 1, had a number of its own historical inaccuracies.\n\nWhat I mean when I say this is that, upon its launch, some gamers took issue with the inclusion of weapons that would have been quite advanced for the period, never actually appearing in conflicts. Whilst this issue was brought up by the community, it was mostly overlooked, ignored or even excused by many. Conversely, there has been an overwhelmingly negative attitude towards the inclusion of woman in Battlefield 5, which I think is perhaps a little funny, because historically, although rare, it wasn't actually unheard of for woman to appear in WW2, whereas many of the guns in Battlefield 1 did not exist at the time (as far as I know).\n\nPerhaps another way of looking at the question would be: is it OK for a game to detach itself from historical accuracy in the name of having the game be more fun for everyone (playing battlefield 1 with strictly historically accurate weapons would have made for a very differently paced experience)? If so, then I suppose the outrage at woman being in BF5 is more understandable (not that I personally fully agree with the distaste people seem to feel). After all, the inclusion of 'futuristic' weaponry was a strictly practical admission, as it was done to keep the gameplay fast paced, whereas the inclusion of woman is strictly aesthetic, offering no tangible difference in gameplay.\n\nI'm genuinely interested in why gamers became angry with the inclusion of women when the backlash from the introduction of advanced weaponry was so much more subdued. Do you think gamers are actually upset about the historical accuracy, in which case, why weren't so many outraged by BF1's weapons, or do you think they're just angry that DICE and EA are implementing women in BF5 out of what many believe to be a pressure to be 'socially aware' and 'progressive?'",

        "text": "The best example would be any long-running series with an annual release. So let's talk FIFA first of all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFIFA games don't change much at all year-to-year when you compare them to the gaming medium as a whole. Some people will take a lot more notice of the changes and understand and appreciate the nuances if they're extremely into the games, but that's more of a minority position.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith that in mind, reviewers could take the approach of judging the games based on how it improves or regresses compared to previous releases. It would essentially answer the question of \"is it worth me moving on from FIFA 18 to FIFA 19 yet? Should I wait for a patch first?\". So taking this approach, FIFA 19 could in theory get a score of 7/10, with the take-away being \"there a few good improvements but it's largely the same game, it's not a must-buy if you already have FIFA 18\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlternatively, judging the game in a \"vacuum\". This would mean in theory that if they released the exact same game but with prettier and more responsive menus, a reviewer would give it a slightly better score, even though it's £45 for essentially a minuscule improvement.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs someone who is looking into buying FIFA 19 and haven't played one since FIFA 12 I'm looking at scores and reviews to find how good it is *in general*, not whether they've made enough strides since last year. But take another series, Pokemon. I massively enjoy each game and I'm happy for them to have minor improvements on the same formula each time. I don't read reviews to see it being judged as just a random JRPG game, I want to read reviews from Pokemon fanatics discussing intimate details about changes to the battle system and game mechanics. I'll be buying it regardless but these reviews help me decide *when* I will buy it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think it's very possible for the review to cover both, and a lot of reviews I read do so. **But when it comes to giving it a score, how do you think they should balance these two factors?** Is it just an inherent weakness of summing up a game with one number that we have to deal with?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know a lot of casual gamers and they'll often just read scores on Metacritic, not the review text itself so it is something that will affect how a lot of people judge potential purchases. I've found that even though reading reviews seems like a totally natural thing to me, in reality only a small percentage of console owners would do this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks",

        "text": "I'll be using Battlefield 4 and 1 as my examples as they're what I'm playing at the moment, and where I take issue with my point below...\n\nThe Battlefield series is known for large maps, vehicles, bullet physics, and squad play. There's the expectation that players will work together in their squads to support  each other (Medics revive people and Supports drop ammo) and move forward as a team (tanks provide cover and take out enemy tanks, planes drop bombs on targets or destroy other enemy planes, cars and motorcycles are used for transportation, you get the idea). However I find in practice that all goes out the window. Squad play is nonexistent, with the squad leader orders might as well be an annoying fly that you can't swat. Quite seriously, no one wants to repair tanks, provide suppressing fire while the regular Assault class pushes, or concentrate anti-vehicle fire on a single target. Infantry combat isn't a push towards an objective or wiping out an enemy squad, it's just a free for all, every man for himself race to get the most kills, not unlike headless chickens running around, however in this case the chickens have an AEK/Hellriegel. There's no incentive in place to work together, despite all of the trailers and marketing suggesting that teamwork is important.\n\nMy question is: how could developers force players to work together? Could you force players to work as a team, even if they don't to? I'll admit that I don't have a solid answer for this, but I'd like to see what other people think.",

        "title": "Gaming's shift towards extrinsic rewards",
        "author": "SilverfireSage",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9j42i2/gamings_shift_towards_extrinsic_rewards/",
        "text": "Gaming is a unique entertainment medium in how it rewards the consumer. In watching a movie, the \"reward\" as it were is simply experiencing the drama unfold on the screen. Television and books are much the same way. Sports are slightly different, and can take on a more personal touch. Competition can lead to self improvement, and there may be prizes or tournaments to win. Gaming is somewhat different, and I believe it's in the dichotomy between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards within the game. \n\nLet's start off with my definition of these two terms.\n\nAn extrinsic reward is easy to define (although \"extrinsic\" may not be the correct term, we'll use it for now): a reward given to the player for completing a task. Whether that's leveling up in an RPG and getting a stat buff, getting a new weapon in Destiny after killing a boss, or getting a shower of gold from a loot goblin in Diablo, these are what people stereotypically think of as rewards. \n\nIntrinsic rewards are harder to define, but think of them as the \"game\" part of the game. Jumping across platforms in Mario, shooting the covenant in Halo, exploring the world in Skyrim all fall under the purview of intrinsic rewards. Generally, this is the first impression you get of a game as well, and is usually termed \"gameplay\". \n\nRecently (as in perhaps the last 10-15 years) I've seen a shift away from focusing on intrinsic rewards in games to more extrinsic ones. A lot of this blame can be put on online games such as Everquest and WoW, MMORPGs where having the coolest loot and being the highest level is one of the main driving forces of the game. RPGs have typically favored extrinsic rewards over intrinsic, as the term has been perverted to mean \"a game with labeled statistics\" over \"role playing game\". Over time, the general RPG mechanics have started to spill over into other genres so heavily, it seems inevitable that a new game will have loot to make your character better and a heavy level up system. \n\nThis can be most obviously seen in the new God of War game. The series previous to that certainly had health increases and new weapons, but the core gameplay was the main focus. Enemies weren't there to be loot bags spewing out gold, they were there to provide a challenge and spectacle. The new God of War trades that to add a large RPG system, with money to buy new items and weapons with incremental stat upgrades, little trinkets to place on Kratos to make them +1% better at a stat, and many of the side quests lead to a new armor piece or a rare crafting material. \n\nThis isn't new to the God of War series, hardly, but it speaks to a general trend in game design where developers seem to think that in order for playing the game to be meaningful, there must be some sort of character reward at the end. This is in contrast to the 80's and 90's, in which many of the games rewarded the player not with a prize, but simply with more game to play and more challenges to overcome. \n\nThis mentality has spilled into criticism of a variety of games as of late, specifically Nintendo games. Nintendo, do their credit and detriment, have always adhered to the intrinsic value of games, viewing them more as toys to play with. Nearly every Nintendo game has wonderful controls, tight mechanics, a wealth of challenges and obstacles, but they generally don't feature much in the way of rewards like achievements or player character rewards. This can be most seen in Super Mario Odyssey. The largest criticism for the game, and not unwarranted, is that many of the moons have no value to them. They're not needed to progress, there's no challenge to getting them, they're simply there to be grabbed. But throwing this criticism out and labeling Odyssey as a bad game is doing it a disservice, as the crux of the game is not necessarily to collect the moons. Rather, the crux is to enjoy playing as Mario, to have fun jumping and exploring environments, and the moons are simply a means of guiding the player to that end. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Should games focus more on the intrinsic rewards, or is this shift towards providing players with more \"stuff\" the way to go? ",

        "text": "Sekiro has really grabbed my attention since it has been announced. Sure, it's another game from the perennially top-of-their-game FromSoft and the combat has the weighty feel and variety of actions of its Souls predecessors. But what really hooked me onto following the game is how it's actively avoiding RPG-like stats. With the increasing number of big-name games either being RPGs or incorporating experience and stats, I believe only Zelda and Assassin's Creed have shunned stats in relatively recent memory (correct me if I'm wrong), and even then, their most recent installments caved in and incorporated stats. Sekiro seems to be taking it upon itself to prove that big-name games don't need stats to be fun.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love stats and experience. I love the feeling of seeing numbers go up and seeing the game deliver on those numbers by having you take out bigger and bigger chunks of enemy health while enemies can only do peanuts to you. I also love the feeling of finding different equipment which has different effects on you; some can give you elemental resistance, some give you more speed, some give you high damage with big windups, and some give you low damage with no windups. Weapons tend to conform to a few classes in most games, but stats are what ultimately differentiate them from one another. I can see why the feeling of seeing numbers go up and trying different equipment on numbers alone appeals to most people, as it appeals to me as well.\n\nOn the other hand, I can also see the weakness behind stats being forced into everything. If the system doesn't really affect the core gameplay at all, it comes off as a cheap way of getting dopamine into player's brains just by seeing meters go up. If the system affects the core gameplay too much, difficulty curving and balance gets messed up. The devs also have to assume that the player will or won't strengthen themselves with the side content. Depending on the side-content assumption, the player can easily lose the game's challenge by doing all the side content and being overleveled, or they can be frustrated because they don't want to do the side content and the game becomes a grind for them. Sometimes, the player feels like it's a grind, then becomes overleveled in the same game. Even though the Soulsborne series prides itself on having skill matter more than stats, it still couldn't fully escape the efforts of players grinding to take the challenge out of the game.\n\nWith all of that said, the lack of stats that Sekiro is embracing has me simultaneously interested in the game and the future it could bring, but also worried about its success.\n\nI'm looking forward to the game because it has been a long time since I have played a great action game without stats. FromSoft has done a good job of not just bucking, but also setting trends, and I believe that Soulsborne has done much work towards making developers unafraid of challenging the player through making both them and the enemies die quickly and having little handholding. How else do you think Breath of the Wild was able to confidently balance exploration, little guidance, and intuitive puzzles while having tangible (if not massive) challenge? If FromSoft could make others be confident of little handholding, I believe that they can also make others be confident of not relying on stats for cheap satisfaction.\n\nI'm also worried for Sekiro's success because player satisfaction may be a bit of an uphill battle for the game. Like I said before, stats are an easily implemented, easily visible, and easily fulfilled way to satisfy players. Without this \"easy satisfaction\", I'm worried that players won't respond as well to Sekiro as they had towards Dark Souls. Worst case scenario, since gamers can be hyperbolic at times, there could be a massive outcry about how Sekiro isn't as satisfying as Dark Souls and that FromSoft is doomed for making one game that doesn't live up to Soulsborne. Yes, that's a silly fear, but I'm mostly worried that the response to the game might just encourage more devs to just incorporate stats for the sake of that \"easy satisfaction\" since it will keep players hooked.\n\nSo what can FromSoft do to make Sekiro work without stats? Can Sekiro simply stand on its level design and Zelda/Metroid-like item finding on its own? Will skill in combat be enough for players to feel like they're getting better? Or will they have to do more to enhance player satisfaction?",
