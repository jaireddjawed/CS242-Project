        "text": "In response to a recent post about self-taught mathematicians.\n\nI don't have much of a formal math education, and I used to pride myself in being self-taught, having gone through a few (non-trivial) mathematical texts on my own. But after enough experience doing this, I realized that to really have any understanding of a concept, you have to \"self-teach\" it to yourself, as opposed to some notion of being served understanding on a silver platter by a teacher.\n\nA relevant experience I had was taking an intro to analysis course (at the university where I did non-mathematical research as a phd student), in which the instructor just went through the first half of baby Rudin. I actually thought he was a pretty good lecturer, and it was only a few years later when I had forgotten everything in the class that I went to the book instead of my lecture notes and realized they were the same. The funny thing is, although I did ok in the class, in retrospect, I don't think I actually \\_learned\\_ anything. I prepared extensively for the tests, which amounted to essentially memorizing the proofs and some exercises instead of actually understanding them deeply, which I was able to do years later when I revisited the material and could take a ton of time to digest every bit of the book instead of being on a deadline that a class imposes.\n\nSo really, the benefit of these introductory math classes that we use to designate being self-taught vs not is really just to force you to cover a bunch of material in a set amount of time. In many cases, this is a significant benefit because otherwise many people wouldn't go through the material on their own, but is it significant in the way we perceive being 'self-taught' vs not? I understand the distinction has an extremely important historical component, as being self-taught 100 years ago meant extremely different things than now. But now, since great educational material is so freely available, is the notion anachronistic and not even applicable today?",

        "text": "So I was helping my company understand why our system quoted a final discounted amount differently than their final amount. It was like a 1.6 million dollar deal, and it was a hundred bucks off. \n\nThe gist was this:\n\nItem is 72 dollars. And it gets a discount of 44%, and then a discount of 45%. And they bought 23,000 items. \n\nIf you discount the individual item, it's 22.18 dollars. Then you multiply that by 23,000 to get 510,140.\n\nBut, if you take 72 dollars and then multiply it by 23,000, you get 1,656,000. Then if you discount that by 44% and then 45%, the final amount is 510,048.\n\nThis is a total discount difference between 69.194, and 69.2. \n\n///\n\nI can understand the discount philosophy. If each item is discounted, you should discount each item and not the final amount. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why the math produces different amounts. Like on a mathematical/abstract level. You would think it should produce the same amount regardless of \"when\" you discount it.\n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction as to why?",

Problem, I don't find it anywhere in my country, so do anyone know a place that might sell a set with good fabric? I have tried googling myself, but I think I may search for the wrong thing as the only thing I get up when I am searching is just like a cover, but I am looking for the whole set of pillow cases, sheet and duvet cover.",

        "text": "This ratio is quite a gem. There doesn't appear to be any good references or explorations of its relationship to Fibonacci &amp; Lucas Series. Let's explore its properties....\n\n(5-√5)/2 = 1.3819 = ε = \"The Emerald Ratio\"\n\nFor this thread let \"The Emerald Ratio\" = ε\n\nThere are many \"neat\" relationships but here are few I really appreciate.\n\nI Imagine many of which are derived from 1/5 = .2 and (√(1/5)+1)/2 = 1/ε = 0.723606\n\nEssentially if you use the equation we typically provide for golden ratio (√n+1)/2 and let n = 1/5 we arrive at the 1/ε\n\n(5-√5)/2 = ε\n\nε = 3-Φ = √5/Φ = (1/Φ²) +1\n\n1/Φ² = ε-1\n\n(ε)(Φ) = √5 so then (ε²)(Φ²) = 5\n\nΦ²\\*ε = Φ²+1 = 3.6180\n\n3.618+ε = 3.618\\*ε = 5\n\nwhich then continues \n\n5\\*ε = 5+ε² and 5\\*ε² = 5+ε²+ε³\n\n5\\*εⁿ = 5+εⁿ+ε⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾\n\nIf we just look at the ratio (1/Φ²) = .38196601125010.... and compare with (1/Φ) = .61803398874989.... we notice that each decimal column would sum to .9999999999 providing another peripheral examination of .999999999 = 1 in the same sense allowing ε+Φ = 3\n\nSomething about this makes .99999999 = 1 feel more natural and less counter intuitive.\n\nPerhaps this is the ratio some ancient cultures utilized when arriving at the \"cubit\" of .523606 of the unit value. I suggest this because....\n\n (√(1/5)+1)/2 = 1/ε = .723606 and\n\n1/ε² = 0.523606 = 0.723606 - 0.2 = 1/ε²\n\nThe next interesting factor is a wildly close approximation for π that is exactly (6/5)Φ²\n\n1/ε² = Φ²/5 = .523606\n\n1/ε²(5) = Φ²\n\n1/ε²(6) = 3.1416407 ≈ π\n\nNormally I despise approximations such as this because it's almost certainly number pareidolia. However, it's interesting to note this value of 3.146407 is also....\n\n(3/√5) + (3²/5) = √1.8 + 1.8 = 1/ε²(6) = 3.146407\n\nSo perhaps the value of the cubit relating Φ &amp; π has merit in the context of \"The Emerald Ratio\"\n\nI chose \"Emerald Ratio\" to describe ε because of the typical ratios that are considered the ideal cut for emerald gemstones which is 1.3 - 1.5 with ≈ 1.4 being considered optimal.\n\nDoes anybody know of any real-world use cases or applications this ratio might be related to?\n\n\\- Cheers",
