        "text": "My mom was the president of the PTO when I was a kid, so I got to spend a lot of time exploring my elementary school after hours. The school was originally built in the late 19th century as a high school for a small village in rural Ohio. As the district grew, so did the school. By the time I attended, the building had become a sprawling and irregular complex filled with hidden rooms, twisting narrow corridors, and dramatically varying room sizes which resulted from decades of crude architectural expansion.\n\nThe place was ripe for adventure in my young active mind, and my friends and I would spend hours exploring its various quirks. The oldest parts of the building were always the most interesting. Evidence of the past fueled our imaginations; an old gym floor peaking through a tear in the carpet of the 6th grade class room, or the names of past students scrawled in a long abandoned room only accessible by ladder and usually off limits during the school day. It also gave the building an eerie feeling, especially when the halls were empty and the drafty uneven temperature of the place was more noticeable. This only added to the sense of adventure as bravery became a necessity.\n\nThe building’s old bones were always creaking. Whether it was the boiler room, a leaky ceiling, withering floorboards, or the old plumbing, each sound felt like an attempt by the structure to communicate, guiding us deeper into its long forgotten recesses. \n\nIt was on one of these after hour explorations that I first felt the playful eeriness of the building turn sinister. \n\nMy friends and I decided to play hide and seek while we waited for our parents to finish their PTO meeting in the newest section of the building. I was one of the older kids and I was more familiar with the building than most, so I built up the courage to explore hiding spots in the oldest parts of the building all alone.\n\nAs I searched for hiding spots, I remember actively thinking about how brave I felt. I was a 5th grader now. It would take more than a few creaky floorboards to scare me.\n\nThat’s when I first heard a small skitter echoing in the halls. Being an old building surrounded by corn fields, it wasn’t uncommon to hear mice making their homes in the buildings walls and rafters, but something about the sound didn’t feel right. It carried too much weight. The nature of the sound suggested something small, like a field mouse, but it enveloped the entire wing of the school.\n\nThere was also something else peculiar about the pitter-patter. It didn’t have the sharpness that would usually suggest the little claws of a field mouse. It felt softer, like the sound a bare human foot would make if we were the size of a field mouse.\n\nI was trying to convince myself that this was normal and that I was brave when I first heard it speak. It seemed to come from everywhere and mirrored the small but powerful nature of its skittering footsteps. Slightly above a whisper, its voice was gravelly and shrill, but also playful in a way that seemed intended to taunt and terrify me. It seemed to savor my panic as its words slithered through the halls with a slow, measured cadence.\n\n“Come find creature.”\n\nI froze in terror. \n\nMy frenzied desire to run and my body’s refusal to obey caused desperation similar to the experience of sleep paralysis, but I had been wide awake. It seemed aware that my panic had rendered me immobile, like a spider, aware that its prey has become hopelessly ensnared in its web. It seemed to sneer as it continued to taunt me.\n\n“Come find creature.”\n\nThe spell finally broke and in a blind panic I tore through the twisted narrow corridors of my elementary school as it continued to taunt me.\n\n“Come find creature.”\n\nEach moment of my hysterical retreat felt like an eternity. I eventually made it back to the relative safety of my peers in the newer section of the building, where the torment finally came to an apparent end.\n\n————————————————————————\n\nI never told anyone about what happened, and the school was torn down in 2006. I never doubted my experience, but it also didn’t define me in the way that other traumatic childhood experiences did. It was like the experience was too much of an outlier to take a place of importance in defining my daily reality.\n\nAfter the school came down, I would sometimes think that the skittering of mice in the walls of childhood home would take on a similar nature to the skittering I heard in the school that day. This would only happen at night when I was about to fall asleep, and I never heard the voice again, so it was easy to write off as an invention of my dreamy mind. \n\nIt wasn’t until a couple years ago, while living in a 19th century homestead on a ranch in western North Dakota that the creature presented itself to me again. \n\nI was battling a high fever and awoke from a fitful sleep in the middle of the night to the same skittering sound. The old wooden chair that I had kept in the corner and mostly just used to pile laundry on was now directly beside my bed, facing me. The chair appeared empty, but as I became fully awake, the skittering stopped and the chair creaked as if straining under a great weight.\n\nIt was then that I heard the same shrill voice I had heard all those years ago in the halls of my elementary school. It had the same measured and taunting tone only this time its words felt more immediate. It was still barely above a whisper, but it felt more demanding than playful this time. It felt intimate. It didn’t feel like it was a disembodied voice coming from the within the bones of the building, the words felt like they spoken directly into my ear from a very close distance.\n\n“Come. Find. Creature.”",

I remember closing my eyes quite forcefully, feeling pain from how bright the lights were. Once I was able to keep them open, I noticed how the entire room was white. It was empty except for the lamp that shone on my face and the recliner I was laying on. I remember how my muscles ached with each movement. It was as painful as my headache though. I tried to think of where the place was or who I was but only a blank came up.\n\nI’m called ████\n\nMy body is 23 years old. It was the same age as when I woke up. Maintaining your body’s age is important for players like me. Every 6 months, we have to be tranquilised and transported to the facility in which, once again, we wake up in a white room with a spotlight beaming at our faces. Same room, same recliner, same muscle pain and headache. The first time I woke up was quite memorable, we were ushered by the existing players into a large hall where the operator gave us instructions and information. I’m quite curious, that’s how I was ... .....  .... ..  ... ....  .. ..  .... ..  . .  ... ..  ... ..  . .....  . ...., so being inputted that much information when I was starting from a blank slate was very interesting for me.\n\nLife is a game and there are no rules, that is, if you are a player like me.\n\nEach player has different gameplay. Some like changing the world, gaining knowledge and making characters that are wise and make differences. These players are usually given top pick in the characters they play, most go for good starting stats like being born into a wealthy family, or having good genes. There are a select few who like adversity, zero to hero gameplay. Entertaining, I’ll give them that. Most players choose from characters that are drawn randomly. The number of characters you can play depends on many things, the main one being existence. When I first woke up, I got to play 7 characters for my first run. Some don’t even get to play a character in their first few years of existence, so I am guessing I had pre-keyed existence points.\n\nAlthough you are but a game character to players like me, it doesn’t mean you aren’t sentient. In fact, giving characters free reign to their own lives is one of the most famous gameplay styles within the association. Unpredictable, interesting, fun. Some players like to bet on things like whether a character will choose this or that. I personally don’t find the fun in it but to each their own.\n\nLike characters, players used to have a lifespan. Rejuvenating the body and reversing ageing was one of the milestones that led to the establishment of the association. Nowadays, we’ve even found ways to extend the brain’s life. We are expecting to achieve deathlessness by 2178. That’s around 3 or 4 more runs from now. It excites me.\n\nLike game characters, we can also form partnerships with other players. Since our bodies are human, many choose to coexist in your societies. It’s been a thing since hundreds of thousands of years ago but around a thousand years prior to now, something caused players to recluse, I haven’t been briefed on it and my existence does not trace that far back. Since a couple hundred years ago, there’s been a reemergence of players looking to assimilate into player’s societies. There’s a funny irony with living side by side with the characters you play while knowing you have control over their lives. We are advised not to meddle too much and be observers but players have no rules so some do tend to do actions that are risky.\n\nI personally like interacting like a real character. I find reading your content particularly interesting, books, articles, news, even conspiracy theories. Having observed for the last hundred years, I find it quite funny how you bend and change your stories so often. Comparing history with your history is particularly funny for me. Sometimes I find myself giggling while I look at the material we’ve acquired from the Seat of the Muses. Players who make remarkable contributions to the association are rewarded handsomely by being given the honour of inputting their consciousness into our system so their existence lives on until this day. I’ve always wanted to meet them but unfortunately, the technology to communicate with them is still lacking.\n\nIgnorant characters are easier to play. Once you are put in charge of a hundred and more characters, you start preferring idle gameplay where characters won’t go off course even if you leave them alone for long periods of time. It’s much more entertaining to play with a select few characters. Everyone else is just to fill up the world.\n\nMy type of gameplay is quite different. Playing with characters that are in secret societies, partake in secretive activities and hide information from the majority of the existing characters while not knowing the biggest secret of all. It’s funny in an entertaining way.\n\nThe existence of players might be a scary thing for most characters to hear, however, the existences you should be most wary of are characters just like you. Next time you go out, keep an eye out for me. I might just give you that stroke of luck you need, or better yet, I might help you find what you’ve been looking for.\n\nLife’s a game. You’re a character I play.",

        "text": "I have no desire to see the things I have seen again, nor direct or guide anyone to where I saw it; I also have no desire to see this story die forever, either. This is my compromise.   \n\nThis was back in the early 90’s, when McDonalds still had good, greasy Big Breakfasts. That’s important later.\n\nMy parents and I ate it at least three times a week while we were traveling across the country. The greasy bags would pile up where I would put my feet as I rotated between three Tiger handheld games.  \n\nWe did a lot of camping during these cross country trips, sometimes on sketchy land. It wasn’t always safe. During on of these trips, my dad bought a gun, a .38 caliber police special revolver and a bag of bullets from a man in the adjacent camping spot while dad was foraging for kindling. My dad was so excited by the fact he had a means of protecting the family beyond a kitchen knife that he hauled out of our paid camping spot less than five minutes after the sale to make sure he kept it. Life on the road made my parents wary of any potential threat or double-cross.  \n\nMy father had a strange fascination with the revolver. We drove only 100 miles one day when we usually did a minimum of 300 when he drove the station wagon up a dirt road a few miles away from the highway, somewhere with a river and trees. My dad shot the revolver and emptied the empty shells into an empty bottle at ten in the morning while mom sat in the car. This was very strange for a man that was usually reserved and conservative, preferring to travel all day. It felt like I was seeing a new man for the first time.  \n\nHe put the sweaty gun into my hands and said:\n\n“We’re WAY out here, you don’t have to worry about a gunshot. Try to hit that pinecone. Just relax, don’t tense up…come on...” I didn’t know how to handle my father’s strange behavior, so I stayed still and fought tears off. I couldn’t bring myself to squeeze the trigger, even with my father yelling at me to do so to “become a man”. My father responded by grabbing the gun, the bag of bullets and bottle of empty shells in one angry swoop, throwing all three on the floorboards while we peeled away in the gravel.\n\nThe three of us traveled in silence for another hour before stopping at a camping spot at the end of an old farmer’s land; we bought eggs from him two years prior, when we were still traveling. We knew it was safe because the farmer said he “never came out this way anymore”, which seemed true; we camped by the big pine with the branches that touched the ground three times before without ever being disturbed. Our old rock fire-ring and pine needle bed where we set up the tent from before greeted us.  \n\nDad gathered some of the plentiful fallen branches while mom collected those greasy McDonalds bags for easy kindling. My father was still steamed about the gun situation it seemed, but as soon as the fire was going, the sun was down and their first beer was cracked, the mood lightened. Soon, we were all joking around we forgot about the gun.  \n\nUntil they saw a bear in the woods across the farmer’s corn field.  \n\nI say bear because that’s what my parents thought it was at first. I couldn’t see past the corn field, but I know the thing towered over the crop from their reactions. My parents said nothing and I asked what was wrong. I looked up and saw only their eyes, which were the largest and whitest I had ever seen on anyone before. They were both frozen in fear looking at that thing come through the corn.  \n\nMy eyes turned from theirs to the thing that came through.  \n\nThe campfire provided only light to its lower half; it was identical to a single ivy-covered tree trunk, the same as any other. All I remember of the top of the towering tombstone shaped shadow was the sheer gravity of it, and how it approached without moving anything on its body.  \n\nIt was like the sheer pressure of this creature made me involuntarily collapse and shut my eyes and scream. I heard my parents screaming and crying too. It was the kind of crying one only does when they know, without a doubt, that this it was the end.  \n\nThen a gunshot rang out. I remember that the huge shadow stopped and the pressure let up a little; it felt like rising up out of the crushing depths of the ocean, if just a small bit at first. Then there was a second gunshot and the shadow winced.  \n\nMy mom shouted “the farmer!” thinking he had come to our rescue, but no one knew where the shots were coming from, except for dad.  \n\nHe grabbed our arms and shoulders and dragged us behind the car, yelling at us to not to get up. I could hear the shadow creak, snap and groan as even more shots exploded from what seemed like everywhere. We went behind the station wagon and just listened to the thing walk stumble in confusion; its footsteps sounded like branches snapping. I was certain I had heard that sound, those footsteps, before while camping. You probably heard them too.  \n\nIt made no sound other than its footsteps as it rustled back into the corn. We came out of hiding when the shooting had stopped.  \n\nIn the ashes of the McDonald’s-bag fueled campfire were a pile of empty .38 caliber shells surrounded by a blood we had never seen before.  \n\nWe left and drove until sunrise. My dad tossed the gun in the nearest river and we never mentioned it again.",

        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen of Morefolk, you all must be terribly confused. I've sent this message to your emails and your phones, which took quite a lot of time, so please listen to me. As you're all well aware, there have been a series of murders in this town of ours. Murders that have, up to this point, had their details kept private. For the \"sake of investigation\", as our police department puts it, the specifics of these crimes have been kept under wraps. Bullshit. All of it. It's all a load of bullshit. Our police aren't keeping this information secret for the security of the investigation. They're doing it out of cowardice. \n\nIsn't it strange that, even in a small town like this where everyone is connected, nobody seems to know anything about the recent deaths?  Ellie... Sasha... Claire... Jackie... all taken away from us. Yet, nobody has anything to say? Do you seriously believe that the husbands of the pregnant women that were slaughtered are keeping quiet because they're too \"traumatized\"? Or, perhaps they keep quiet due to some kind of nondisclosure agreement they have with the police, right? Wrong... all wrong. The police have BRIBED and BULLIED the husbands of the victims into silence.\n\nIt's come to my attention through my own investigation that this goes deeper than just the police force. They're being ordered around by an agency that remains unnamed even within the files I've managed to crack. All this is to say, this situation is much more than it seems on the surface. After finding what I've dug up, it's obvious to me why they're trying to keep the husbands quiet. You know what? Fuck that. I never trusted these damn cops. I knew something suspicious was going on. You all have a right to know the truth. \n\nBelow is a leak of a transcript containing some very... interesting information. The police force is going to lie to you, they'll tell you that what I am about to expose is purely fabricated. They're cowards, all of them. I dare you to look into their eyes as they lie to your face, and tell yourself that you trust them. With that being said, allow me to grant you the real truth.\n\n(Start of Transcript)\n\nDetective Casper: \"Alright, the date is February 17th, it's 8:45 AM. My name is detective Casper. Everything from here on out is on the record. Mister Middleton, I appreciate your willingness to speak about what happened last night. Typically we wouldn't... handle things this way. We'd have you cleared psychologically first, and this session wouldn't occur for a while longer. Unfortunately, this isn't a conventional situation. I hope you understand.”\n\nMiddleton: \"Yeah... I do\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"That being said... your voice is shaky, and your eyes are still red. Are you okay? Can you do this right now?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Do I look okay to you? I'll be \"okay\" when that crazy bitch gets executed. You hear me?\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I hear you, and I promise you, the more help you give us, the closer we'll get to delivering justice. You're doing a brave thing here today, I hope you know that.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"I'm not fucking brave. I couldn't do anything to stop that... that goddamn monster. I'm not brave. I'm angry. I just want that thing dead.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I know... I would too, trust me. You keep referring to the suspect in rather inhuman terms. Why is that? Was the suspect wearing a mask or some other form of concealing clothing that made them appear less human?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"You... you aren't going to believe me... I just know that thing couldn't have been human... it couldn't have been... it looked human but it just wasn't.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I apologize, I've gotten ahead of myself. Let's not focus on that right now. Let's start from the very beginning. Typically, criminals of this sort tend to \"stalk\" and \"survey\" the homes of their victims. They spend time figuring out the schedules and patterns of behavior of their victims. Did you notice anything strange before this tragedy happened? Maybe a car suspiciously driving past your house repeatedly? Perhaps someone consistently looking at your property? Anything at all?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"No, never. Everything seemed so... so normal. I swear, I didn't see anything like that.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I understand. Thank you. I would also like to mention, if at any time you require something to drink or eat during this interview, please tell me. We will be happy to accommodate you.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"I'm okay, thanks. If... if I put anything into my stomach, I'm afraid I'll just vomit again. My throat already hurts enough as is...\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Understood. Once again, you're being very brave, please stay strong, for your wife.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Please... call her Jackie...\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Sure. Do it for Jackie, okay?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Yeah... for Jackie....\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Alright, thank you, Mr. Middleton. Now, going forward, I'm going to ask you to describe the events that happened last night. If at any point in time you feel uncomfortable, we can take a break. Do you understand?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"I understand, I do....\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Very well, let's proceed. According to your call with dispatch, the events unfolded at or around 1:13 AM. Is this correct?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"That's correct.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Right, now then, could you explain what exactly happened that night? I will ask you to be concise, but I will refrain from interrupting you. I'm all ears, okay?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Alright... well, Jackie and I were in bed, asleep. I remember waking up to the sound of thumping. I couldn't exactly place it, but I soon realized it was coming from underneath the bed. Jackie woke up right after that. I got out of bed and... I looked at the floor. There was a fucking hand... just, sticking out from under the bed. It was a woman's hand. This whole time, the thumping from under the bed just continued and continued...\"\n\nDetective Casper: Was there anything on the hand? Any jewelry, any identifying scarring or tattoo?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"No... nothing like that. It was just a pale hand. Jackie couldn't see it at the time, but she was already really freaked out by the bumping. I shouted at the person under the bed, I told them to come out. I heard a lot of shifting around, and the bumping immediately stopped. The hand stretched forward and clawed at the floor like it was dragging the rest of the body forward with it. I... oh Jesus...\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Are you alright?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"I can keep going... please. I can do this.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Very well, please continue.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"It took a while for that... that thing to come all the way out. It... it looked like a nude woman, but it just... it was so off. It couldn't have been human. There's just no way.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"How do you mean? What made it appear so inhuman to you?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"There was... a long, stitched-up gash on her abdomen. Her eyes were so cloudy and grey... and it looked like tears were leaking out of them. She was nearly bald, her head only had a few short hairs sticking out of it. Oh God, the smell... she smelled like utter shit... and the way she moved. She didn't stand up at first. She just laid on the floor and looked up at me... You have to believe me. That thing was not a human. It was something else... I'm not crazy. I swear on my life I'm telling the truth.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I believe you, I do. You're a great help to us right now. Here, take some tissues. It's okay. You're doing great. Take your time, alright?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Thank you... I uhm.. I appreciate it. Please continue to believe me... What I'm about to say doesn't sound real, but, but... but it is. I promise it is.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I'm here for you. It's okay. Every detail matters.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Okay... Okay... She uh, she opened her lips while staring at me. She didn't move her mouth or... or move her lips or tongue. But she made this, just... this awful noise. It sounded like an infant crying. Just... that sound coming out from her lips, it isn't natural. It isn't human. The crying sounded... like if you took a recording of an infant crying and you looped it over and over again. It was the most horrific shit I've ever heard.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"She didn't even move her mouth? You said it sounded as if the crying were coming from a recording. Did you happen to notice any audio-playing devices on her person?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"No... she was completely naked, she couldn't have hidden one anywhere. That... that sound... it was coming from her..\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I understand. Please, continue, if possible. What happened after that?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"I just... froze. I couldn't move a muscle. It was like I was having a sleep paralysis episode. My body was stiff as a rock, and she stood up and faced Jackie. Jackie must've been so scared... she couldn't move either. She just laid in bed, with a look of horror on her face... Oh God... I should've done something, but I just... I couldn't. I felt completely numb.\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"It's understandable, oftentimes we freeze up in horrifying moments. It isn't your fault.\"\n\nMiddleton: I know, but... this was different... This wasn't just me freezing up in fear, it was like... it was like nothing I've ever felt before. She, uh, she was standing next to Jackie, and... I... I think I'm gonna be sick. Please, can I just... take a break? Please?\n\nDetective Casper: \"Of course. We'll take a fifteen-minute recess. You're doing a fantastic job, you deserve a break.\"\n\n(15 Minutes Pass)\n\nDetective Casper: \"Alright, we are now back in session. Mister Middleton, are you comfortable resuming where we left off?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Yeah... I am. I still feel sick, but I have to do this. I do. That monster stood next to Jackie and... it just... it tore into her. It just dug its horrible fingers into her stomach and began ripping and clawing and just... it was so awful. There was so much screaming and so much blood... oh my God. Jackie... Our poor baby... he was supposed to be our baby... he was supposed to be alive. He was supposed to be named Jack. He was supposed to be alive and be our baby. And that fucking monster just... took him from us. It clawed its way inside and ripped Jackie open and tore out our child...\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Please, Mister Middleton, I know you must be hurting. Please, stay focused, or you'll upset yourself further. What did the suspect do with the child?\" \n\nMiddleton: \"She... She... she tore into her own abdomen... she tore her stitches apart and opened her own abdomen... her own womb... and she forced our baby inside of her... she fucking... she fucking... oh dear God...\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Mister Middleton, our forensics crew didn't recover any DNA that might belong to the suspect as of yet. From the sound of it, she should have bled quite profusely inside of the room, based on your description. Wouldn't you think so?\"\n\nMiddleton: \"I told you, she's not fucking human. She didn't even bleed. It was like... just an empty cavity in her abdomen. And she stuffed our baby in there... my wife is dead, my unborn baby is dead... you think a human could have done something like this?\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"I think you're understandably upset by this event. I think that some details might be exaggerated or misunderstood in your head.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"You don't... you don't believe me, do you?\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Look... we are taking everything into account. We are truly trying to bring justice for you, Jackie, and Jack. We really are. We are going to consider your account going forward in our investigation. Your help is appreciated, Mister Middleton.\"\n\nMiddleton: \"Fine... believe me or don't. But mark my words. When you find the fucker that's responsible for this, you'll see that it's only a vicious creature. Don't try to reason with it. Don't try to arrest it. Put a bullet in its fucking skull? You understand me?\"\n\nDetective Casper: \"Noted. Do you have anything more you would like to add to the record?\" \n\nMiddleton: \"Just... just kill it...\"\n\nDetective Casper: “Alright, this marks the end of the recording at 9:27 AM”\n\n(End of Transcript)\n\nFunny how the \"official record\" is still being kept secret, huh? These bastards know what they're doing. Every single interview with the husbands has consistent themes. No signs of forced entry into the home. Knocking under the bed. The man is unable to move. The descriptions of the woman and the sounds she makes. What she does to the poor mother and child... it's all consistent. Something horrible is happening in this town. The police, and whatever agency is contacting them, are suppressing this information. I am going to blow this whole thing wide open. I am going to find out what's going on, for the sake of our town. \n\nKnow that this is not the final leak I will spread. Know that I am urging each of you to embrace the truth. Know that I am calling on each husband they tried to threaten and bribe into silence to speak out. You all have a right to safety and transparency. This cannot continue, for the sake of our friends and family. Morefolk is a place of dignity, there's no room for gruesome murder and government corruption here. This will not be the last you hear of me. \n\nSigning off for now, \n\n\\-J",

        "text": "  \n\nI don’t usually go to the movies alone, but long story short, there was one I desperately wanted to see, my wife wasn’t interested and none of my friends were free, so on a wet Saturday evening, I found myself beating a lonely path to the movie theater.\n\nI had booked a seat beforehand, thinking that the theater would be packed on a Saturday, but to my pleasant surprise, my screen was entirely empty. I was expecting more people to show up during the trailers, but as they drew to a close, no-one appeared.\n\nI was just about to celebrate my good fortune that I would effectively be having a private screening, when the door to the theater opened, and someone came in.\n\nI couldn’t get a good look at them in the dark, but based on their build and stature, I guessed that it was a kid, no older than 12 or 13. He was wearing sneakers, jeans, some sort of sports jacket and his hair was spiked up in a style seemingly favored by every adolescent when they get their hands on their first tub of hair gel. I couldn’t make out any other facial features in the lack of light.\n\nThe moment the boy had entered the theater, my heart had sank. I’d been in movie theaters with teenage boys before, and they almost always behaved disruptively. At least this one hadn’t showed up with a gang of friends.\n\nMy heart sank yet further as I realized that the boy was heading towards me. My seat was in the back row on the central aisle. I’d chosen it so that I could make a quick and easy escape if I needed the bathroom. I was quietly hoping that the boy would sit down somewhere else before he reached me, but he only stopped walking when he was standing right next to me. He didn’t say anything, but his presence seemed to radiate impatience as he stood waiting for me to stand up, so that he could sidle past me to one of the inner seats on the back row.\n\nI wanted to tell him to sit somewhere else. The theater was completely empty, why did he want to sit on my row? The only conclusion I could draw was that he was looking to cause trouble and I was his only target. But I didn’t want to be rude unnecessarily, and for all I knew, this kid’s motives might be entirely innocent.\n\nReluctantly, I got to my feet. The boy squeezed past me without saying a word and sat in the seat right next to mine. I groaned internally. He had the whole row, but he had to choose that seat. Of course he did. I bit back an angry remark and sat down again. My patience was being tested. If this kid tried anything, I hoped I’d be able to keep myself under control.\n\nI did my best to ignore my new neighbor and enjoy the movie. But after about a minute I became aware that the boy had turned his head and was staring at me. I turned to look at him. Although the theater was dark, my eyes had now become accustomed to the gloom, but I still couldn’t make out any features on the boy’s face. It was like it was shrouded in a shadow deeper than the darkness of the theater. And yet I could feel his eyes on me, as if they were boring into my soul.\n\n“Hey,” I whispered to him, “Could you not do that?”\n\nHe didn’t say anything, just kept staring at me.\n\n“Are you okay?” I tried, “Why are you staring at me? Is there something you want?”\n\nHe still didn’t say anything, but nor did he look away. I wondered what to do. I could go and get an usher, but how would I explain the situation? Strictly speaking, the kid wasn’t doing anything wrong, but his unwavering stare was unnerving.\n\nI shook it off, and tried to focus on the movie, but found it was impossible to concentrate. What did this kid think he was doing? Was he waiting to see if I’d lash out over something as seemingly innocuous as looking me? Well, if that was his intention he might just get his wish.\n\nI finally lost my temper and leaned towards the kid.\n\n“If you don’t stop staring at me,” I hissed, “I’ll go and get an usher and have you thrown out.”\n\nThis threat was met with a wall of silence.\n\n“Right,” I said, getting to my feet, “If that’s the way you want it...”\n\nI felt the kid’s eyes on the back of my neck all the way to the exit. Once I was in the lobby, I accosted the nearest usher I could find.\n\n“Excuse me,” I said, “There’s this kid in my screen. He won’t stop staring at me.”\n\nThe usher looked at me, confused.\n\n“I’m sorry sir, there must be some mistake. We haven’t sold any other tickets for that showing this evening.”\n\n“Well obviously he snuck in,” I said exasperatedly.\n\n“I don’t think so. I’ve been on duty here the whole time. I haven’t seen anyone except you go in or out of that screen.”\n\n“Then he must have done it stealthily,” I said irritably, “Look, could you just come and tell him to cut it out?”\n\nThankfully, the usher agreed, and we returned to the theater. Only to find it was completely empty. I stared around. My interaction with the usher couldn’t have taken longer than a minute or two, and in that time the kid had disappeared. The usher and I searched up and down the aisles, but we couldn’t find any sign of him.\n\n“Well, it looks like he’s snuck out again,” the usher said, “If he reappears, let me know.”\n\n“Don’t worry, I will,” I promised, returning to my seat.\n\nDespite everything I managed to forget about the kid and enjoy the movie. He never reappeared and I figured he was just another juvenile prankster looking to rile up unsuspecting members of the public.\n\nThe movie finished without any further incidents and I left the theater, sprinted through the rain to my car, and once inside, texted my wife to let her know I was on my way home.\n\nAs I drove home, the rain lashed my car windshield, and even with the wipers going at full force, I had to squint through the downpour. I could only just make out the brake lights of the car in front, which was moving much too slowly for my liking. I flicked on my indicator to move into the next lane and glanced up to check my rearview mirror.\n\nMy heart nearly jumped out of my chest, and I had to fight to keep the car under control as a jolt of terror shot through me. I heard several horns blare as the car lurched this way and that as I tried to stop it from spinning out on the wet road.\n\nSitting in the back seat right behind me was the kid from the movie theater. His face remained shrouded in shadow, but as before, the moment I became aware of him, I could feel his eyes on me, staring. I let out a yelp of fright.\n\n“What the fuck?” I screeched.\n\nI wanted to swivel around in my seat and confront him, but a small part of my self-preservation instinct had remained intact through the shock and I kept my eyes on the road. I needed to find somewhere to pull over. The little shit must have snuck out of the movie theater while I was talking to the usher and had somehow broken into my car. Well, I’d teach him a lesson he wouldn’t soon forget.\n\nI tried to keep my eyes off my rearview mirror as much as possible as I searched for a section of road where it would be safe to stop the car, but the whole time I could feel the kid’s eyes on me.\n\nFinally, I found a safe place to pull over. I stopped the car, pulled the hood on my waterproof up to protect myself from the rain, then stepped out of the car. I yanked open the back door on the driver’s side -\n\nOnly to find it completely empty.\n\nI stared. There was no way that the kid could have slipped out in the few seconds it had taken me to get out of the car to open the back door - I’d have heard the door opening and closing.\n\nI flicked on my phone’s flashlight, expecting to see the kid crouched in the gap between the front and back seats laughing at me, but there was nothing, and the back door on the passenger’s side remained closed. I shone the flashlight around expecting to see someone disappearing into the nearby trees or hurrying off up the highway, but aside from the cars zipping past on the road, I was alone.\n\nI was only getting colder and wetter standing out in the open. I decided that my imagination was playing tricks on me. I got back in my car, and continued the journey home without any more disruptions.\n\nWhen I arrived back at my apartment, I’d mostly shaken off the unsettling events at the movie theater and in my car. My wife asked me how the movie was, and I said I’d enjoyed it, without telling her about the kid.\n\nWe were standing talking in our living room, when I happened to glance up the long corridor that leads from the living room to our front door. For the second time that evening, my heart leapt into my throat and I let out a gasp of fear.\n\nThe lights in the corridor were off, but I could make out the shape of a person standing at the end of it. It was the kid from the movie theater. Although his face was still enveloped by shadows, I had the by now familiar feeling of his eyes fixed upon me.\n\nMy wife had reacted instantly at my exclamation.\n\n“What’s wrong?” she asked.\n\nI jabbed my finger up the corridor.\n\n“There’s someone there,” I hissed, “It’s -”\n\nBut in the split second where I’d looked away the kid had gone. My wife looked confusedly up the corridor where my finger was now pointing at an empty patch of wall.\n\nI decided now was as good a time as any to explain to my wife what had happened earlier that evening. She looked genuinely concerned as I told her about how the kid had spent the whole time in the movie theater staring at me, and had then reappeared in the car only to vanish into thin air on both occasions. Once I’d finished the story, we immediately set about searching our apartment for any signs of him or some other intruder.\n\nOur apartment isn’t large, so it didn’t take us long to search every room and come to the conclusion that there was no sign that someone else had ever been in the apartment. I’d locked the door when I came in, and it was still locked now. Even if I’d in fact forgotten to lock the door, we’d have heard someone come in and lock the door behind themselves. Our apartment’s on the third floor of our building and there’s nothing outside except a sheer brick wall. Due to the inclement weather, our windows were closed and bolted. Unless someone was a master climber and was good at picking locks, there was no way they could have gotten in that way.\n\nMy wife believed me when I said I’d seen something, but there was no rational explanation for how this kid kept disappearing so quickly. In the end, we chalked it up to being a shadow person - a phenomenon where a patch of shadow is perceived as a living, humanoid figure. They’re often encountered by people experiencing heightened emotion. I could reason away that the kid had really been in the movie theater, had been deliberately trying to freak me out with this behaviour, and had managed to sneak in and out without being spotted by me or the usher. The encounters in the car and our apartment could then be explained away as a shadow person - since I was already unsettled from the encounter in the theater, I’d started seeing things.\n\nSatisfied with this explanation, my wife and I went to bed. Although I was still a little on edge, I managed to fall asleep fairly quickly.\n\nI had a nightmare that I was back in the empty movie theater. I was in my seat in the back row, but something was horribly wrong. My body didn’t feel like it belonged it to me. It was too small. I looked down at my hands, and saw that they were a child’s hands. What the hell was going on?\n\nThen the theater door opened and someone walked in. It was a man. At least, I thought it was a man. He was tall and thin, with long scraggly hair, wearing a long black coat. He seemed to absorb the darkness around him and his face was masked by shadows. He saw me and began walking towards me.\n\nThe shadow man was so thin he slid past me without my needing to stand up, and sat down in the seat next to me. As soon as he sat down his head rotated towards me. Even this close, I couldn’t make out his face. It was like a dark veil was plastered over it obscuring any of its details, but I could tell his gaze was fixated on me.\n\nMy heart was pounding. I tried to ignore the man, hoping he’d stop staring, but he didn’t, and to my horror, I realize that he was slowly reaching his hands out towards me. I tried to leap back, but he suddenly struck like a viper, wrapping his arms around me with frightening speed. I struggled, but despite his slight frame, the man was surprisingly strong. I could barely move. I could barely breathe. I tried crying out for help, but as I did, I realized something else was happening. The theater was getting darker and it felt like my seat was descending into the floor. I looked around and realized that my body was being enveloped in shadows. They seemed to be emanating from the shadow man, sliding over me like a black bodysuit. At the same time, I saw that we were indeed descending into the floor. It felt like I was drowning in the darkness. I opened my mouth in a last, desperate attempt to call for help, but before I could, I was completely swallowed by the darkness \n\nI was floating in a void. I couldn’t see anything around me except endless blackness. I looked down, but I couldn’t even see my own body anymore. I flailed my limbs about, but I couldn’t feel anything except empty air. I didn’t know what up or down was. I was disoriented and terrified.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a deep, rough voice in my ear.\n\n“RORY FLANAGAN.  YOU’RE OURS NOW.”\n\nI jerked awake, breathing hard. I looked over at my wife but she was still fast asleep next to me. The bedroom was dark, but compared to the dark void I’d just been in, it seemed light as day.\n\nMy breathing began to calm, but I was still trying to come to terms with what I’d just experienced. The last moment stuck with me in particular - who on earth was Rory Flanagan? That wasn’t my name, or the name of anyone I’d ever known or heard of.\n\nI looked over at the clock. The digital display read 4:06. I tried to get back to sleep, but I was too shaken by the nightmare and I was still wondering about the name I’d heard before I’d woken up.\n\nRealizing that I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep any time soon, I got up and went to the living room. I booted up our computer, and after working my way through the login process, typed the name “Rory Flanagan” into Google.\n\nThe first result that came up was a local newspaper report from seven months ago. It said that a 13 year old boy named Rory Flanagan had disappeared. My hands began to tremble as I read the next part. He had last been seen in a movie theater. The same movie theater I’d been watching the film in the night before. He had gone there on his own, without the knowledge or permission of his parents, and without any of his friends. His parents had guessed that he’d snuck out to watch an R-rated film they’d expressly forbidden him from seeing, but after he’d entered the theater, he had never been seen again by another living soul. Until now.\n\nI was sure that I had seen what had happened to Rory Flanagan in my nightmare last night, but I still have no idea what any of it meant. Who was the man? Where had he taken Rory? And why was Rory back now, seven months later? Why was he stalking me?\n\nI have a feeling I’ll be getting answers to these questions very soon, but I may not be able to tell anyone else. I felt eyes on the back of my head as soon as I finished reading the news story. I haven’t been brave enough to turn around, so I’ve focused on typing up this post in the vain hope that someone who can help will read it. But I fear it’s too late now. I just felt a pair of hands clap down on my shoulders, and it’s getting dark again.",

        "text": " \n\nI drank too much. Again.\n\nThe only conceivable solace I could find in my extremely hungover state came in the form of steam and scalding water, and I indulged in the only way I thought possible: laying in the shower. \n\nThoughts of the night before come and go through the lens of a broken kaleidoscope, each drink remembered with a punishing throb from the inside of my skull. I’d like to say I was celebrating, going out on the town with friends or participating in some kind of party. The truth is, this is just the latest stunt in my own shameful self-indulgence. Like the ones before, I *swear* it’s the last time. Deep down, I know I’m only lying to myself.\n\nI don’t know how long I’ve been here. My only keeper of time is the slowly cooling temperature of the water, one I ignore by slowly turning the knob further with my foot. I don’t think of the added money on the energy bill or the wasted time of my day off, my only concern is the soothing water that berates me, and the muggy air with each labored breath.\n\nI live alone. No significant other. No kids.\n\nWhile I’m happy there’s no one to see me like this, a part of me wishes there was. Someone to judge my decisions, maybe someone to encourage me to be better. Someone to help take this pain away.\n\nBriefly, I open my eyes and look around my small enclosure in the shower. The beige vinyl covered in trickling water is somehow soothing, a silent comfort as I watch the mist collect on my skin. For a moment I look up at the shower head to see the continuous rain it bestows upon me. It’s a cheap shower head; one of the streams sprays out of line, directly into the wall where a washcloth is hanging. The insignificant defection doesn’t bother me, but its soaked the rag fully, causing a repetitive drip that lands on the ledge of the tub. A *drip-drop* that annoyingly splashes my face.\n\nMy head throbs, my neck is stiff, and my blood pressure feels  high. I ignore the annoying splash and nestle back into the crook of my arm, trying to block out the memories of the night before, and the nights before that.\n\nJust as I feel myself succumb to the dampened relaxation and fall asleep, I hear a noise.\n\nA tapping.\n\nI think I imagine it, so I ignore it. I stir uncomfortably, repositioning my face so water doesn’t collect in my ear. I focus on the running water, hearing the rhythm of the shower's stream, with the occasional *drip-drop* of the soaked washcloth. I think of how I should’ve saved something from the night before, a little hair of the dog to ease the brunt of my ailments. If only I wasn’t so damn self indulgent and didn’t drink the last drop of everything I had.\n\nI hear the tap again. Louder, this time.\n\nI open my eyes, the weight of lead shutters lifting as I look around me. I see the beige surround and the trickling water. With an exasperated sigh I shift and try to prop myself up to look around better, but each movement is taxing and feels like too much work. I poke my head past the shower curtain briefly and see the bathroom door still shut as I left it. The bathroom is empty, there’s nobody there. I listen for the sound again, blinking away water that collects on my face.\n\nFor a time, there’s nothing.\n\nI lean forward and turn the knob on the faucet again, increasing the heat. It’s feeling chilly, and I just want a little more time before I transition from here to my bed. As I nestle back into the same awkward position, I hear it again. I feel an uncanny anxiety creep over me, followed by the scrawl of goosebumps. \n\nIt’s coming from the wall in the shower.\n\nI find myself sitting there, looking at the beige wall. I must be losing it. There’s no way there could be anything there; behind the wall the shower is built into is just the walk-in closet of my bedroom. There’s nothing in there but clothes and boxes.\n\n*I need to stop drinking*, I think to myself.\n\nI dismiss the noise and settle back in, resting my cheek in the crook of my arm before closing my eyes. I focus on my breathing, the slow inhale and exhale of steam as I mentally find a better place. I focus on the water again, listening to the rhythmic stream followed by the drops from the hanging washcloth—\n\nI hear the tap again. Louder than before.\n\nThe sound makes me jump, and I look around nervously. I subconsciously make a mental note of everything in the shower with me: beige surround with trickling water, a squeeze bottle of shampoo on the ledge next to me, a rounded bar of soap sitting dangerously close to the edge… everything seems in place. I listen for the noise, putting my hand on the wall to see if I can feel it. I wait in the downpour of water, feeling strangely nervous.\n\nNothing. Nothing at all.\n\nI stifle a laugh and rub my eyes. I have to get my shit together. This is ridiculous.\n\nI sigh and start to lay down again, shivering against the cool air trying to creep in from the other side of the shower curtain. I adjust the curtain to try and keep the humidity in before getting into position. Just as I settle in I notice something I hadn’t before. Something so small it hadn’t caught my attention until now.\n\nThere’s a crack in the caulking of the tub, almost disguised by the build up of soap scum and mold. I put my fingers on the broken seal, and it crumbles under my touch. Bits of old silicone wash away, revealing a bigger crack. I feel the faintest chill of a breeze coming through, one that gets worse the more I mess with it. I think of what could possibly be on the other side, something other than drywall and water damage. There’s no way it could be anything else. The closet is on the other side.\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I decide to look in. I kneel down and take a peek, propping myself up on the ledge of the tub as I get closer and closer. I think I see something moving, and I hold my hand up to shield my face and better see through the steam.\n\nDeep in the darkness of the cracked seal, there’s nothing.\n\nI laugh to myself again and wipe my face. Of course there’s nothing. I’m just hungover, tired, and reaching. I need to sleep. I just need to sleep.\n\nI turn the knob again to make the water hotter and lay in the shower again, feeling foolish. Just a few more minutes and I’ll get out. I just need a few more minutes.\n\nNestling awkwardly into the crook of my arm I try to fall asleep again. I take a deep breath and let it out, trying to rid myself of the tension I have fabricated. There is no tapping. There never was. I focus on the spraying shower, letting it soothe me as I sink further into my own misery. I let the ambience wash over me, along with the occasional *drip-drop* from the hanging washcloth.\n\n*Drip-drop.*\n\n*Drip-drop.*\n\n*Drip. Drip. Drip. Drip.*\n\nI feel cool droplets hitting my temple, followed by an ice cold draft. I shiver and turn so the water warms me, but the draft is too chilling to go away. I want to ignore it, desperately just trying to sleep and forget and be far away from my own thoughts. The drips continue, hitting my face and hair more aggressively until they’re hitting my nose and eyelids. I think of the washcloth hanging, trying to rationalize the annoyance so I can just let it go.\n\nUntil something touches my hair.\n\nThere’s a woman dangling above, inches from my face. Her hair is long and soaked, tangled strands dangling as they drip water onto my face. I try to scream but the air is caught in my lungs, her features petrifying me more as I have no choice but to look at her. Her eyes, mouth, and nose are missing, bloody gaping holes residing where they should be. Her naked torso is pale and abnormally long, twisting in a way that seems impossible. The rest of her is concealed by the darkness of the hole she comes from, a jagged tear where the tub surround has been peeled back to let her through. Roaches and spiders start to pour in behind her, lining the walls as I stare into the missing features of her face. She looks like she’s trying to cry, but can only babble with swollen lips. \n\nWithout warning water erupts from the holes in her face, a gushing icy blast that chokes the scream in my throat as it finally comes. I try and kick my feet but I can’t move, each limb feels too heavy to lift under the weight of her presence. The water is dark and burns my eyes, and I can feel the tub filling around me. I watch her slowly fade as the water rises, blotting everything out until the last thing I see are the bugs skittering over the water's surface.\n\nI wake to the sound of the water. I open my eyes and see the beige surround of the shower, and see that I’m still laying in it. No hole in the wall, no bugs, no woman; only the same crack near the ledge where I had first seen it. I had fallen asleep.\n\nI sit up and shiver, my limbs aching from being in such a weird position for so long. The cascading water has lost most of its warmth, and I reach up and shut it off. It takes me a while to get to my feet, but I’m determined to get the hell out of the shower. I throw back the curtain and grab a towel, drying my face and hair before stepping out onto the bath mat. I’m shivering and ready to find clothes, but my first step out of the shower makes me freeze.\n\nThe bath mat is completely saturated, and the floor is soaked.\n\nAt first I think I left the curtain open too much, but the thought fades when I keep looking. The bathroom door is wide open, and the water continues into the hall, like I had already gotten out of the shower. Clutching the towel I follow the trail, shivering as I leave the warmth of the bathroom behind me.\n\nA trail of wet footprints leave the bathroom, and the air is cold as I follow them. I expect to find the woman waiting for me, but when I step into the living room, I find it empty. I only find my apartment door open, the footprints leading out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[—AHS](https://www.reddit.com/r/HawaiianShirtFiction/comments/s1rwfv/online_story_archive/)",

        "text": "my neighbors dog isnt right.\n\nI'm a 28 year old male I have a dog named kloe, have no close family, and I live in the suburbs. Until just recently I have been a normal 9-5 type of guy working, eating, sleeping. Around spring of last year my new neighbor had moved in a, 32 year old female and a dog named Milo. When I tell you that this dog is shaped like no other I mean it. I asked, let's just call her kylie, what type of dog it was and she said it was a Saint Bernard. Automatically I sensed something was off because I've seen those dogs before and they didn't look like hers. But I just brushed it off like it was nothing and went back home. \n\nThe next morning I go went for a jog with kloe through the park. While I was waiting for kloe to do her business I see kylie and Milo. We exchange a conversation and pet each others dogs, at that moment while petting kylies dog I realized how thick and weird it's fur felt, kylie said that it has a rare condition. By that time I felt like it was time to go home.\n\n After that encounter we hadn't really seen or talked to each other, but suddenly kylie invites me and kloe for dinner so that \"the dogs can get to know each other\" me being tired of eating insta-meals I agree. Me and kloe arrive next door and kylie greets us while milo sits in the background. While I'm waiting for dinner to be made I'm petting milo and kloe while talking to kylie, then milo rolls over to lay down and I start rubbing his belly and feel something.. out of place it feels like a zipper like from a jacket. I decide to keep my mouth shut wondering what's the worst that can happen. Me and kylie are eating when I notice kloe is acting strange around milo, so we go home.\n\n While I'm getting ready to go to sleep I see something from my window it's kylies bathroom I take a glance and see milo, but something wasn't right in a brief moment I watched as a man unzips from the dog which used to be milo. and I'm petrified, in a brief moment of fear I run to kylies door and bang on it.. but no response I do it again.. but no response. I look in the window to see what happened and there it is there's \"milo\" standing above kylies cold dead body. I'm too stunned to do anything so I slowly walk back inside thinking about what I just saw locked every door in the house and went to sleep.\n\n The next morning the cops knocked on my door and questioned me about the body.. I lied.. \"I saw nothing officer\" deep down I knew.. I knew everything but I zoned out as I watched \"milo\" in the dog suit roaming around the neighborhood. It's been a year since that happened and I still haven't told anyone about this experience until now.",

        "text": "My roommate made up a game in which she sews together a creepy sock doll and pretends it’s alive a la Elf on the Shelf, and asked me to join. I mean, would *you* play that game? Why not name the doll “Chuckie” while you’re at it?\n\nRight so… I played it.\n\nAnd let me preface this by saying last I checked I was of sound mind, excepting my dubious choice of major, philosophy (a degree that will allow me to think very deeply about the universe and my lack of employment in it). I am a scholar and a skeptic, and wouldn’t believe any of the account I’m about to give if I hadn’t seen the doll move myself.\n\nThe doll, or rather, *whatever evil force is moving the doll,* is real. It is walking around my house. It may or may not have disappeared our hamster (who often escapes her cage anyway, so it could all be a coincidence—but still, as of this moment, Binky is missing).\n\nSo—prank? Elaborate puppetry? Hallucinatory episode? I hate all of those options, but since I can’t come up with any better explanation—hive mind, willing to help me science this thing?\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n**The scenario:**\n\nI, Plato,\\* am a fourth year philosophy student—a major that explains why I am still broke and single (folks, pardon me if you’ve heard some of these jokes before, they’re obligatory for my philosophy degree). I live in a house with three roommates: Karen, Binky the hamster, and Curt.\n\nIt all started a few days ago with Karen’s fab new idea to promote her channel. Karen is pursuing her degree in motivational makeup tutorials and clickbait (or as she calls it, *marketing*). She frequently drags Binky and me into her ongoing quest for likes, shares, and subscribers. Much as I’m apt to criticize the vapidity of our modern-day scramble for clicks, the hamster has more followers than I have job options. Anyway, Karen opened her proposal with, “Hey, this year for Halloween, we should play the doll game!”\n\n“The doll game?” I said.\n\n“The doll game!” she enthused. “It’s like Elf on the Shelf, but you play on Halloween instead of Christmas, and you use a doll you make yourself.”\n\nElf on the Shelf? I’d rather play Stye on the Eye. (It’s where I get a stye on my eye and go to the doctor rather than having to play this game… And ok, in my defense, it’s hard to come up with catchy rhymes on the fly—speaking of which—)\n\n“This game sounds made up… did you make it up? Is this for your tiktok?”\n\n“No!” She said with huge doe eyes, lashes fluttering.\n\nI side-eyed her. “And it’s called the doll game? Doesn’t it need a catchy name that’ll let people know right away what it is? Like Elf on the Shelf?”\n\n“Doll in the Hall!”\n\nFolks, the brilliance that is Karen.\n\n“Sure, I guess, for Halloween,” said I—I, knowing we are in March, and I’d have a full seven months before my required participation. This is a bad habit of mine—present-me often makes commitments that future-me regrets.\n\nCue Karen, swooping in with a dose of instant karma for present-me: “Oh good, you’ll do it? Sweet! We don’t have to wait for Halloween. We can try it now and see how things go, and do it again if it’s popular!”\n\nI felt sort of tricked. But, fine. We were playing “Doll in the Hall.” Not that our apartment *has* a hall (details, schmetails). Apparently, it was a riff on some creepy game Karen found that went viral circa 2006, called Hitori Kakurenbo because it’s a Japanese horror game (of course it is). This translates more or less to “Hide and Seek Alone,” in which you make a doll, stuff it with rice and a bit of hair or fingernails (ah yes, the horror flavor text—because handmade dolls aren’t creepy enough), and then put it in the bathtub. Stab the doll with a sharp object and tell it, “You’re it.” You go and hide, count to ten, and the doll comes searching for you. If it catches you, it kills you with whatever implement you stabbed it with.\n\nWin, and you… well, I guess you win a creepy doll.\n\nBut you also *lose*, because you spent hours making that doll whose only purpose is to kill you. (And truly, do we blame the doll on this one? You created it, you brought it into this world, and then you stabbed it. *You monster.*)\n\nTruly a game where there are no winners, only sincere regrets.\n\nFortunately, Karen’s version, “Doll in the Hall,” doesn’t involve stabbing (Yay! Score one for lack of cruelty-to-dolls). Instead, in the days leading up to Halloween, you move the doll around, similar to the elf on the shelf. On Halloween, it comes to life for real when the spirits inhabit it.\n\nNothing about this could go wrong, surely.\n\nBut we were playing in March so, in Karen’s words, “It probably won’t come to life.” Right. Natch.\n\nNow, my general reluctance to play had nothing to do with fears of the doll actually coming to life (oh, if only I knew then!). I just figured it would be a pain in the butt to play along for the camera every time Karen wanted to upload a new video tracking the movements of her homemade frankendoll, and expecting me to be a willing actor. But it’s not like she had a lot of options. Binky was already the star of 80% of her content, and our other housemate, Curt… well, was Curt.\n\nSo, Doll in the Hall!\n\n“Sure,” I said. “Let the games begin.”\n\nKaren squealed in delight, and actually hugged me, which made my heart palpitate a little bit because I have a small unrequited crush on her. Then she asked for a clipping of my hair or nails and I immediately regretted every life choice I’d ever made that had lead me to this moment.\n\nFingernail clippings? Gross.\n\nA lock of hair it was!\n\nMe, Binky, Karen—locks from each of us went in.\n\nThe doll, sewn by Karen out of socks, looked like what can only be described as the horrific lovechild of a demented sock monkey and a junkie elf on the shelf fallen on hard times. It had mismatched buttons for eyes, sock arms and legs, and a wire skeleton so that it could be extra terrifying (Quoth Karen, “It’s *not* for scariness, it’s so it can be bent to different poses!”). I vetoed rice as a filling material. I wasn’t about to let her waste that much rice, nor was I willing to eat said rice after it had been mixed in with our hair clippings. So she used cotton stuffing. Some of our hair went in with the cotton, but she used most of it to make these weird little pigtails sticking off the top of its head.\n\nCute.\n\nOnce it was finished, we all sat around for a naming ceremony, which was really just an excuse for Karen to make a promotional video.\n\nI suggested Cuddles.\n\nKaren wanted to call it Boo Boy, presumably so she could call it her “boo” for short.\n\nBinky had the deciding vote, and no surprise, voted with Karen.\n\nBoo Boy it was.\n\n**The Game Begins:**\n\nBoo Boy spent the next few days appearing and disappearing from various locations around the house. Karen generally played dumb, asking me in that Bambi-eyed way she always did when lying, “Did you move Boo Boy? I can’t find him!”\n\nMagnanimously, I played along. There was one day when we really couldn’t find him. I could tell because Karen came to me, asking where he was with a sly look—apparently she thought *I’d* moved him and was getting more pro-active about being in the game. (I wasn’t. I may have been volunteered like a reluctant audience member pulled onto the stage for the magician’s act—but I had no plans to cross the line from audience participant to magician’s assistant. I’ve seen what they do to those assistants when they put them in the boxes and bring out the saw!) When I did my usual schtick of “gosh where could he be,” and she realized I didn’t actually know, she panicked.\n\nTurned out it was Curt who had him.\n\nCurt seldom interacts with us and isn’t a student. As to what he does… mafia hitman, caveman method actor, head summoner for a Cthulhu-worshipping cult bent on bringing a reign of supernatural terror into the world? Pretty much nothing would surprise me. He showed up with Boo Boy in hand, demanding, “What the fuck is this voodoo shit?”\n\nI giggled nervously while Karen took out her phone to film.\n\nCurt snapped at her to get that camera out of his face and warned that it’s a bad idea to mess with “black magic fuckery.” Then he stormed off, telling us he wasn’t going to be involved in the game and he wasn’t responsible for “whatever bad shit goes down.”\n\nThis was probably the most Curt had spoken to either of us in six months. I was a little concerned by his outburst. Not—again—because of any fears of the supernatural, but because I prefer to keep the peace between us. Also, it is his house.\n\nKaren, for her part, was delighted by Curt’s overreaction, and shut herself up in her room with Boo Boy to make another video about it.\n\nSo far so normal.\n\nBut then… last week, things started getting weird. For example, on Monday, I was sitting on the couch, reading (philosophy, natch. I’m kidding. I was on Tiktok watching people ascend mountains of milk crates. OH GOD I’M PART OF THE PROBLEM). *Ahem*. I was lost in videos of people tumbling from crate piles like inept mountain goats, and Karen was trying various filters on Binky (Binky with bunny ears! Binky with human teeth— *shudder* —Binky Karen face swap!). Suddenly, Curt’s door burst open. He hurled Boo Boy at us, his voice shaking with fury:\n\n“I *TOLD* you not to involve me in your voodoo shit! It’s not fucking funny! Next time *EITHER* of you leaves this piece of shit ratfucking dark magic *thing* in my room, I will rip it up and burn it!”\n\nHe slammed the door.\n\nKaren burst out laughing.\n\n“Oh my god!” she cried. “Oh my god, I wish I’d had that on video! That was soooo good! Well played, Plato, that was awesome!”\n\n“It wasn’t me,” I said, frowning.\n\n“Next time tell me you’re gonna do that so I can record it!”\n\n“Um, did you hear him? I don’t think there’s going to *be* a next time if you want Boo Boy to make it to the end of this game. Also, *it wasn’t me*.”\n\n“Sure it wasn’t,” She snickered, and winked.\n\nWinking is something Karen does in her videos to try and look conspiratorial with the audience. Being the subject of a wink made me think that, possibly, she was in on the whole thing and had done it after all. Although…\n\nWeird, that she wouldn’t have her phone ready to record, had she set that up.\n\nAfter that incident, Boo Boy would periodically vanish and reappear in places that neither Karen nor I could explain. I assumed it was her doing (and she, presumably, assumed it was me). None of the places were that unusual. We’d find him sitting on the shelf in our rooms, or in the fridge apparently raiding the meat drawer, hidden under the bed with his arms propped under his chin so he could look out, or peeking up at us from a drawer that was mostly closed. He seemed especially prone to appearing around Binky’s cage, but I assumed that was just so Karen could get both Binky and Boo Boy in her videos.\n\nThen Binky disappeared.\n\n“All right, enough is enough,” Karen announced, in a tone that indicated she was genuinely upset, though at the time I had no idea why. “Where is Binky?”\n\n“Huh? I don’t know. She’s not in her cage?”\n\n“If she was in her cage, would I be asking?”\n\n“Maybe she escaped.”\n\n“Look, the top is off the cage and the bedding is a mess inside. It’s obvious she was chased around by someone trying to grab her. Where did you put her?”\n\n“I don’t know why you’re coming at me. Maybe Curt let her out for some reason. But it certainly wasn’t me.”\n\n“Curt’s out of town. He left yesterday, remember? Binky was still in her cage.”\n\n“Really?” I didn’t remember. Curt leaving for a week or two at a stretch was not unusual. I just didn’t bother to keep track of it.\n\nKaren wouldn’t back down. She genuinely thought I stole her hamster, and possibly even did something to her. Why would I ever hurt Binky? I’m a vegetarian. I can’t even watch movies where animals get hurt. A horror movie where the cat yowls, or the dog runs out barking and then yelps in pain? I’m out. I told her this, and Karen shouted, “So did you take her to *liberate* her then? Because you *hate* cages?”\n\n“You’re being ridiculous,” I snapped—which wasn’t my most diplomatic, but I was feeling defensive. I don’t lie. I never lie. And I wouldn’t “liberate” a domesticated hamster from what is honestly a pretty cushy life, even if Binky *is* an unwilling social media star. Like most influencers, she’d never make it in the wild. I pointed this out to Karen, but she was hysterical, worried about her Binky, and retreated to her room crying.\n\nI felt bad for a few moments. In my attempt to defuse her accusations with humor, I might have appeared to make light of the situation. In fact, I was very worried for Binky, too. I looked over at Binky’s cage—\n\nI froze, chilled.\n\nThere were two button eyes looking out at me from the edge of the bookshelf beside the cage.\n\nBoo Boy’s mismatched eyes and little pigtails bore an expression that, if I were to anthropomorphize a doll, I’d term *naughty. Mischievous.*\n\n*EVIL.*\n\nI stared for a moment, and without taking my gaze off it, called, “Hey, Karen, did you move Boo Boy?”\n\nNo response.\n\nIf she found Boo Boy by the cage later, she’d definitely get upset. She’d likely assume I put him there and was messing with her. I grabbed the doll.\n\nBits of wood shaving clung to its sock arm.\n\nFrowning, I plucked off the shavings.\n\nIn hindsight, this should have been a red flag roughly the size of Mars. The equivalent of the moment in a horror movie when the camera pans to the killer doll sitting smiling with the missing dog’s bloody collar in its porcelain fingers. The moment I usually nope out of any such film. But as I’ve said before—I, a rational person, do not believe in ghosts. I assumed that a) Curt had set this up before he left to pay us back for pranking him that one time, or b) Karen had set it all up herself, and was now engaged in an elaborate dramatization, all in service to the gods of social media fame. And if it weren’t for what happened later that night, I’d still assume this to be the most plausible explanation, and I’d be posting on AITA with my fellow jerks, instead of here, on nosleep, with you spooky kookies… of which I guess I am now one (how do you do, fellow ghostbusting kids?)\n\nAnyway, I decided I’d had enough of Boo Boy, and the best thing to do to end this before her game got way out of hand was to destroy it.\n\n**First Steps:**\n\nI took Boo Boy into the kitchen and snipped its arm off with scissors. I was intending to cut it up and toss it in the trash. Only… while I was cutting, I began to feel a shade of remorse. After all, Karen’s videos were important to her. She’d put a lot of time into this “Doll in the Hall” series. And if I destroyed the doll now, she wouldn’t finish. The least I could do was destroy it on video for her.\n\nPlus if I destroyed it, I might ruin our relationship as amicable roomies.\n\nSo, while I considered her accusations about Binky to be wildly overstepping, I retracted my behavior. I sewed back the arm and considered. What to do with the doll, then? Eventually, I settled on hiding it. I’d agree to give it back if she stopped taking things too far and promised to wrap up the game.\n\nI hid the doll inside a lockbox with my birth certificate, social security card, and other docs. A place Karen wouldn’t dare search, and from which Boo Boy couldn’t escape—I chastised myself for this thought almost as soon as I had it. Even so, I made sure the box was extra locked, and tied a ribbon on it for good measure, before shoving it deep into my closet. The key remained on my person. Karen was still holed up in her room—I could hear her making a video about Binky’s disappearance and asking her followers for advice. This seemed to confirm my theory that the whole thing was an elaborate circus act for clicks. Presumably, she’d blame the doll later and the show would go on. Fabulous.\n\nI buried myself in my reading, and thought nothing more of it that night. Eventually, I went to sleep.\n\nI woke in the dark in the dead of night. At first I wasn’t sure what had awoken me, but when I clicked the light on, I frowned, because my closet door was ajar.\n\nA faint whisper—a rustling—drifted to my ears from the carpeted floor just outside my door.\n\n“Binky?” I wondered.\n\nMaybe Binky really had escaped, somehow.\n\nI got up, padding softly to the door, and opened it. The darkness out in the living room area was too complete for me to make out anything but dim shapes, but I’d definitely caught the sound of scurrying just before I’d reached the door, like something darting away toward the sofa. I fumbled round for a moment along the wall and then flicked a switch.\n\nMy heart dropped to my toes. It’s lucky I didn’t have to pee, because if there’d been anything in my bladder, I’d have emptied it.\n\nThe doll—Boo Boy—was *walking.* It took two running steps along the sofa before, like Woody in Toy Story worried about being caught, it abruptly froze. Froze, and remained frozen, as if it had been posed there.\n\nI stared.\n\nThe doll (it seemed) stared back.\n\n“Karen?” I called. But there was no response. Presumably Karen was sound asleep. I strode over to the doll and snatched it up, half expecting it to come to life and writhe like a viper in my grip. But it was just a doll. Its button eyes, though, seemed to be watching me (*Just my imagination,* I told myself). I stepped to Karen’s door and knocked, and when there was no response, opened it to soft snoring. Definitely asleep. There was no way she could have moved the doll and dashed to her room and into bed without me seeing. There had been no one in the living room. No one. Just the doll. I flicked on the Karen’s light switch, thoroughly spooked.\n\n“What’s going on?” Karen slurred, yawning and sitting up. She asked if I’d found Binky. I told her no. Then I told her what I’d seen.\n\nHer eyes grew wide—with fear? No. Of course not. With delight.\n\nThen she got out her phone to have me do a fucking interview. My co-star Boo Boy alongside me.\n\nFML.\n\nBut the walking… it was *real.* I swear to you it was real. This is why I moved my post from AITA to here. I need your help. Karen won’t give up playing this game with Boo Boy. And I… is it crazy that I sort of think this might be dangerous? What do I do? If I destroy the doll, WIBTA? Resolving ethical conundrums is supposed to be one of the few things my degree is useful for, but philosophy doesn’t really cover, you know… paranormal puppetry.\n\n[What do I do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",

        "text": "[TW:  graphic depictions of manipulation, verbal, physical and psychological abuse]\n\n\nIt has taken me many years to tell this story out of both fear and embarrassment. I share this today as more than simply therapy for myself, but as a warning to all people: be careful who you meet on social media. \n\n\nThis is a true story, though names have been changed. \n\n\nIn 2018, my ex husband and I were at the end of a very tumultuous marriage. He and I had been polyamorous for about 3 years before I met this guy. For the sake of this story, I'll call him Jerry. \n\n\nI met Jerry on OkCupid. I was 28 and he was 42. We hit it off very quickly. After a few weeks of talking, I agreed to meet up with him at a restaurant close to my house. We sat and talked for a few hours before I invited him over to meet my husband. Things went very well and they seemed to get along so Jerry and I started dating.\n\n\nThis guy completely swept me off my feet. Jerry was sweet and caring. He enthusiastically listened to every little thing on my mind, engaged, and validated me. Over and over again he absolutely revered me for my strength and wisdom- he practically worshiped me for all that I was and all I was becoming. He showered me with gifts, flowers, and random good deeds just to make me feel safe, wanted, and cared for. I had never been in a relationship that felt quite like that. It was wonderful. It was as though we had been looking for each other for years. \n\n\nAfter the first few weeks, he had a meltdown over my polyamorous nature. He \"pulled the plug\" because he said he was already falling for me and couldn't handle sharing me. I stood my ground and accepted this boundary and the fact that I would have to let him go. I left that night sad but confident that I had done the right thing for the both of us.\n\n\nThat next week he sent me flowers and a card to my workplace, begging for another chance and reassuring me that he would rather try than not and end up regretting it; even though it was scary, he wanted to take this journey with me.  We continued dating and it was just as wonderful. Long nights we spent awake talking, sharing, laughing, love making, and planning. We went places and did things that I had always wanted to do. Then in the deepest, most intimate moments, when we would just sit in silence, he would grip my hand to his face in solidarity and astonishment asking \"where I've been\" all this time. Our time together was effortless. We fit together like puzzle pieces.\n\n\nBy August of 2018, my marriage had ended, by no fault of Jerry's, and by October, my husband had moved out. I was on a lease at the time and knew I couldn't afford the place on my own, so finding a roommate was essential. I had no support system to fall back on nor did anyone else I know need a place at the time, so Jerry offered to move in. Even then I was hesitant, we had only been together about 4 months and I knew everything always changes when you move in with a partner. Despite my hesitation, I agreed, he was wonderful to me. How bad could it be? I was not prepared for the change that was to come.\n\n\nIt was literally like night and day. Jerry suddenly became a different person. He was extremely controlling, jealous, and lazy: nothing like the person I thought I had met. And the way he treated me progressively got worse and worse. Hanging out with friends became a burden, if not impossible because he would blow up my phone, guilting me about leaving him alone or not involving him in some way, yet when I tried to, it was also treated as a burden and inconvenience as he would huff and puff his way through even the concept of leaving space for anyone but ourselves.\n\n\nIn December of 2018, we attended my work Christmas party. I had given him the option whether he wanted to go or not. It was really neither here nor there for me, especially because I had already learned that he really didn’t do well if he felt pressured into social situations. I opened the invitation to him because he had expressed to me over and over that it was important for him that he was involved in my social life. For the full month he knew about it, he insisted that he wasn't going. I took it as him being introverted and didn't push the issue. I let him know that I would make sure he felt welcome if he decided to go, but not to feel obligated. I was surprised when he changed his mind at the last minute and insisted on going. And even more stunned when we went and he actively acted as though he did not want to be there.\n\n\nEveryone there was incredibly welcoming and included him in the festivities and conversation. However, he still practically grumbled the entire night about the whole thing, mumbling insults and critiquing every little part of the party under his breath, as though being there was absolutely awful to have to endure. No one really seemed to notice the low whispering insults and gripes. At one point, after a couple of glasses of wine, my direct manager leaned in to Jerry and started praising him. She and I were very close, therefore she was intimately familiar with what I had gone through with my ex husband. \n\n\"I am so so happy she has you.” she bleated through wine-happy “You have been absolutely transformative for her. It's so nice to see her finally happy and appreciated.\"\n\n\nWithout missing a beat, Jerry grimaced at the comment and quickly snapped back\n\"You don't fucking know me.\"\n\nI honestly didn’t believe my ears. It was one of those moments where time stops and you just know you couldn’t have heard that correctly. I sat brewing on it for a minute before another  lighthearted interaction with Jerry prompted him to suddenly snap at me through grit teeth. \n“Stop it.”\nThis triggered me and I lost it. \n\nI pulled him outside and asked him what his problem was. I called out his behavior and told him if he was going to act that way then he could just leave. That if he didn’t want to be there, he should have stayed home. He ended up giving a sort of half assed apology and we went back inside and finished the party.\n\nI remember the drive home that night, staring out the dark window at nothing in particular, in worried silence. I might have messed up. Was my only thought through the entire drive.\n\n\nThis all started out slow, of course. Like, waving me away or invalidating my experiences and ideas due to my age: that I was just dramatizing my experiences because I was young, etc. The man who, not six months prior, had validated me, my trauma, and experiences to the ends of the earth. Now every time I started a story or tried to share anything, even trying to plan out meals for the week, he would openly show annoyance as though I was violating his time and attention. \n\nBefore I knew it, he was snapping at me over every little thing. If I asked how his day was or talked about my day, I would aggressively shut it down:\n\n\"Why do you always ask me that? I don't want to talk shop at home.\" \n\n\"I really don't care about your work. It's work.\"\n\n\nBefore I knew it, I couldn't even bring him a plate of breakfast without being snapped at.\n\nIt was as though he was testing me. When Jerry and I first started dating, he flat out refused to talk about most all of his exes. He refused to name them or discuss any of  the issues or lessons learned. They “didn't matter” he would claim; they weren’t in his life “for a reason”. It was the same reasoning he also used in reference to my more recent exes- talking about them, including my now ex husband may as well have become off limits. Any time I brought up either of our exes, he would become incredibly agitated, belittling, and just overall very aggressive. I took this as both an age gap issue, as I have a tendency to dwell, as well as insecurity and a threat to the life he was trying to build.\n\nHowever, after he moved in and this “hot button topic\" had been established, several times, he would bring up his exes and how they looked, telling me on more than one occasion he \"would have never dated me back in the day.\" And that I was \"lucky he lowered his standards.\" I didn’t even really know what to say to this. I would laugh it off and shove it in my back pocket. Noted. \n\nHe then started bringing up my looks and accusing me of “Catfishing” him. I had stopped taking care of myself due to the isolation and had also put on some weight, so most of my clothes that I had once felt great in, no longer fit. And since Jerry had also been dishonest with me about his financial position, he was always needing extra money here and there, leaving me broke almost all of the time. \n\nA horrible tragedy happened that following summer, while Jerry and I were together. I received notice that a good friend I went to art school with shot himself in the head while tripping on LSD. Our whole class was devastated. He was, without contest, the best photographer of our class and one of the most kind hearted individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Also as someone who is very familiar with LSD, I was rocked.\n\n\nJerry, however, was far from supportive. He pretty much immediately shrugged it off.\n“That’s life. I guess that’s what he gets for fucking around with LSD.”\nI was baffled at such an unsympathetic response and even more later when Jerry started to interrogate me about my relationship with this guy, asking when the last time it was that I had even talked to this friend.\n“You don’t even know this guy anymore. Who cares?” \n\n\nI broke up with him the first time after he called me at work raging. I was busy, so I wasn’t able to answer right away, but once I was finally able to answer, I was met with intense anger. It was storming and one of my dogs was having an anxiety attack due to storm and separation anxiety. This wasn’t the first time and he was well aware of what she needed in those moments.\n“Why the fuck arent you answering my calls? You answer when I call you, I don't care where you  are.” He went on for a few minutes, calling me a shitty girlfriend and laying into me over my sudden distance and lack of communication while I was at work.\n\nAt this point, I was done and I lost it. I tore into him over everything, especially causing problems for me at work. That being in my life is a privilege and if he's going to wake up every day acting like he hates me, then I don’t know what on earth he’s even doing with me. I told him that I expected him to get his things and leave (he was always threatening to go back to his old roommates where there was still a room). I didn’t want him there when I got home and we could coordinate times for him to come and get the rest. He flat refused, suddenly victimizing himself, claiming he had nowhere to go.\n“How dare you make me fall in love with you. How dare you take me to meet your father and then dump me.” \n\nMy manager and her husband ended up following me home that evening because she was concerned for my safety and had offered to let me stay with her for a few days. I will never forget the scene I walked into. Like Theon Greyjoy begging for his life. \nMy boss stood next to me, watching as this 42 year old man crawled on his knees before me, begging for mercy and communication. At one point, wrapping his arms around my legs, crying into them:\n“I can’t believe this is happening. She’s the love of my life, you know that?” he cried to my boss.\nI couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. This was the antithesis of the heartless person I had been spending my days with. I shook him off and went to the back of the house, gathering enough of my things to get me through the next few days, as well as any and all valuables I could think of. \n\nIt took a few days, but after about a week, Jerry started blowing up my phone: Apology after apology. Suddenly, he was the man I met again: full of humility and self awareness. He acknowledged the awful way he had treated me and sent me walls and walls of well thought out messages, psychoanalyzing his own behavior, where it comes from, and the ways he knows it needs to change.\nI took him back. Like a dumb, desperate girl, I took him back. \n\nIt wasn’t long into this second round that he started to guilt me over the break up. My panic had damaged his relationship with the people in my life and he made sure that I knew it was my responsibility to fix it. \n\nIt wasn’t long after this that my car ended up breaking down at a gas station close to home. There was a very nice couple in the vehicle next to me that came to my rescue and checked things out under my hood. The gentleman turned out to be a mechanic for a living, so he had a pretty good theory about what could potentially be going on. By this time I had already attempted to contact Jerry to let him know what was going on and where I was. It wasn’t long til he got off work, so he told me to sit tight and he would be there shortly. Meanwhile, this sweet couple stayed put and kept me company while I waited. \n\n\nJerry barrelled in about 15 minutes later, completely ignoring the couple that had helped me. Touching base, the gentleman handed me a slip of paper with a name and phone number on it, reviewing what he thought was going on with my car…\nBefore Jerry butted in, cutting him off \n“I said she’s FINE.” he snapped. \n\n\nI could see the woman out of the corner of my eye, slink away at this comment and get into the passenger seat of their car. I could feel the sudden tension, like maybe she's been here before. The gentleman didn’t move and shifted his attention to me as Jerry walked into the store. I could see he was clearly concerned.  \n“Are you okay..” he asked in a low, almost whisper “You don’t have to answer that but if you need anything..” he looked down at the number in my hand and nodded to it “seriously.”\nWith that, he got into the driver's seat of his car and drove away.  \n\nI’ve thought about that couple countless times since that night. \n\nEverything went right back to the way it was before. As though the initial break up never even happened. \n\nThe same eggshells, the same belittling. If anything it was worse, because I had permanently damaged our relationship. If I had just not been so dramatic. If I didn’t “run away from everything” then maybe he wouldn’t have to work so hard for respect in my life. \n\nOne night we got into an argument. I don't even remember what it was about, but I had to be up early for work the next morning, so I paused the argument in order to get some sleep. \n\n\nWhen I went to lay down, I heard the TV turn on. I have a soundbar, so the volume can get pretty loud. Jerry proceeded to turn the volume up and up...and up. Far past any volume I ever pushed those same speakers to even for parties. The very walls were reverberating with the sound of the TV at astronomical volumes. Jerry then started laughing hysterically. It was a laughter manic with anger as though something MIGHT be funny on TV but he MIGHT also jump through a window right now. I remember laying in bed absolutely horrified at what was happening. I knew things had gotten bad, but now I was scared. I got out of bed and asked him to turn it down, to which he responded, scoffing:\n\n\"I'll watch TV if I f***ing want to.\" And turned it up even louder.  I felt like I was in a horror movie.\n\n\nI started crying at this point, begging him to please, please just let me sleep. He started mocking me and calling me names for crying.\n\n\"Oh waaah. Poor baby is crying again. That's your card isn't it? Crying?\"\n\n\n This caused the fight to start again and he started screaming at me, followed me to my bedroom, where he suddenly punched a door not 2 inches from my head. His eyes were black and he looked me in the eye, sending the clear, unsympathetic and hostile message that that was a warning and next time he wouldn’t miss. My whole system had shut down at this point and I sunk to the floor in a panic attack. My exhusband had issues with violence. Jerry knew that. All our rentals prior to that one had holes in walls and doors peppered throughout our unit due to my ex husband's inability to handle his emotions. But he never hit me, or even came close to it. \n\nI crumpled to the ground feeling powerless, trapped, and afraid. As my thoughts continued to race, he continued to berate and mock my panicked state. Most of our argument from that night was a blur, but ended abruptly once he threatened to put my social security number on the dark web. At this point, all that was left in me was to fight. I blacked out and went ballistic, screaming at him to get out. I felt rabid and dangerous as I screamed like a banshee for him to leave my home. It was over and I was ending it that second. \n\nI contacted my landlord and explained what had been going on. Jerry would also end up contacting her, weaving his own tale that I was moving out and tried to have the lease transferred into his name. Luckily, since I was several steps ahead of him, my landlord didn’t fall for it and contacted me immediately. She personally came and changed my locks for me, gave me the personal contact of a police officer close by in case he showed up again, and took half off my rent for the next month. I am forever grateful to her for these simple acts of kindness that were above and beyond anything I would ever expect from a landlord. \n\nIt took weeks for him to stop messaging me. The only reason I didn’t block him was out of fear that he would show up at my house. Though I had contacts for protection, I knew I would rather get a daily apology video than have to deal with him on my doorstep. So they persisted. For a while. The same act from before: the love bombing, the promises, grasping at straws trying to  find the weak spot where I would let him back in. But I ignored it. It continued for weeks before he finally gave up. He bowed out gracefully, stating boldly that he will always love me. I left him on read. The illusion was destroyed. \n\nIt took me several years to pick up the pieces. If my divorce wasn’t enough, this definitely made me lose trust in myself. I still don’t understand what the endgame was. He has since disappeared entirely from any and all social media.\n\n\nIn one of our last discussions, I asked him desperately \"what happened to the guy I fell in love with?\"\n\nJerry looked me dead in the eye, smirked, and said \n\n\"That guy doesn't exist. I told you what I had to tell you in order to get you away from that fucking asshole husband of yours. You're just stupid and fell for it.\"",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/10lys62 )\n\nI think convincing my roommate to get some counselling was a good idea. Sunny started to make friends in the sorting room at the mailing company. I was glad that Max and I weren’t the only people he had to talk to. A big day arrived, and Sunny’s mood dropped. I hated the fact I needed to work that day and offered to stay home for him. Sunny refused and helped me get ready. \n\nHe got in contact with a group of the same creatures from his species. I encouraged him to meet with them because no matter how hard I tried, I would never understand what he needed to deal with in his day-to-day life. I was human. He wasn’t. He didn’t want to meet the others feeling a little bit of something like survivor's guilt. He gained his freedom before he was bought and sold to be used. Some of the slime creatures in the group hadn’t been so lucky. Sunny didn’t feel as if he had any right talking with them, but I gently forced him to try a single meeting. I hated how he refused to let me stay to see how it went. But I understood he didn’t want me to hover. He needed to deal with some issues on his own. \n\nI double-checked I had everything in my pockets. Snack for myself, snack for Max, and the Sunlight from Trin I forgot to bring it most days. Sunny let me give him an encouraging hug and I was off to work. The Zero room was oddly busy. I’ve never seen so many people inside it at once. All of them wore the same mailing uniform. Most looked almost entirely human aside from some odd features here and there. I found Max in the small crowd and asked him what was going on. \n\n“Oh, we all have an easy job but it can be dangerous. There are going to be a few groups to finish delivering supplies and-” \n\nMax got cut off by someone requesting some help to lift a very heavy box from the pile on the other side of the room. I nodded and let him hurry off to work. I wasn’t entirely sure what was going on so a creature that stood nearby started to fill me in. He had a mouth that went from his forehead to his chin with countless teeth showing and no other features. His long black hair was tied back in a bun, and I wondered how he did his hair so well without any eyes. \n\n“We’ll be delivering goods to a Corporation training ground.” He explained as I followed to help him pick up some wooden boxes. \n\n“Training?” I asked trying to think back to what The Corporation was. \n\n“Yeah. There is a cave where the worlds are thin. The cave connects to a world of creatures that devour everything, but they go feral for magic. If there is too much in the cave, they can break through the seal to pour through to this world. That’s why all the weaker mailmen are doing the delivery today.” He explained as we stacked boxes near the open doorway. \n\nI found it hard to tell which creatures were stronger than others. I didn’t have a clue just how much magic the creature that just spoke to me held. Apparently, Rufus was a bit of a big deal, but he never gave off those kinds of vibes. I opened my mouth to ask more questions but got cut off. \n\n“Tulip, can you come over here?” A new voice called off to the side \n\nThe creature turned his head at the request. He then got ready to leave to find the person that called him over. I wasn’t expecting his name to be something so cute. He stopped just long enough to tell me something. \n\n“You’re the human, right? A lot of us want to thank you for doing this job. We never felt strong enough but if a weak human could do this, we all figured we could. This might not have even been considered as an option until you lived for so long.” \n\nI never thought about that. I looked around the busy room wondering how many of these creatures applied to the job because they saw I was doing so well. It did help the company out a lot. Max and I normally picked up the easy jobs to free up the stronger workers for harder delivery jobs. Sunny working in the sorting room meant one more delivery person could work in the field. I gave the creature a nod unsure of how to respond. His odd mouth widened into an unnerving smile. Tulip left to find his partner leaving me alone. \n\nI wasn’t sure what else to do besides help move more boxes near the door. I spotted another deliveryman having issues picking up a box. I went over to him and bent down to take the other end of the box for him. \n\n“Need a hand?” I offered and immediately wanted to kick myself. \n\n“Actually, I do.” He said in a kind tone. \n\nWhen we both straightened up, I saw the left jacket sleeve empty. His lips were also torn on his left side revealing some teeth. It looked like he lived through some sort of rough attack. I panicked wondering how to save myself from what I just said. He smiled in a way that would endear him to anyone. He had the same kind of charm Max held. \n\nHis hair was a light cream color and tied back. His left eye a light blue while the other a deep coffee brown. I’ve never heard a person with such a calm tone to their voice. I rarely liked a person as quickly as I did with him. \n\n“You’re Toby, right? We’ll be partners for this job. My name is Jackalope.” He introduced himself. \n\nWith the box in his arm, he wasn’t able to shake my hand. At least I didn’t extend my hand for one that wasn’t there. Max came over glad to see I had already found the person I was working with that day. Since I was the one without any magic, I was the safest option to go to the bottom floor of the cave. Jackalope was picked as my partner because he was strong, but currently recovering from an injury, which I assumed to be his missing arm. If something happened, he could help me get to a safer floor. \n\nWe let Max go. He was on the stronger side of the creatures in the room, so he was going to be on the first floor of the cave. At least Jackalope was extremely easy to get along with. The boxes were heavy, but we got to work getting them to where they needed to go. \n\nThe door in the Zero room opened out to a cliffside with a dark opening set into the rocks. We carried our delivery inside, Jackalope leading the way to an old mining elevator. A few of our co-workers piled on with their goods and got let off on different floors. There were four levels in total. The air got heavy as we went down further on the creaking steel cage of an elevator. I needed to zip up my jacket to try and keep out the chill of the air. This cave just felt wrong. There was no other way to describe it. I suppressed a shudder the moment the elevator opened to the final floor. \n\nInstead of lamps, or some sort of magic light source, countless glowsticks were placed along the cave. It was enough light to see by. My stomach turned from staring off into the massive cavern that felt like it went on forever. \n\n“There are a few rooms on the bottom floor we need to drop off some supplies inside for the Agents to use as they train. I’ve used the training grounds before, so I know the way.” Jackalope said, his voice slightly echoing off the walls. \n\n“Oh, were you an Agent?” I asked unable to help myself. \n\nWe started walking, burdens in hand. My eyes landed on an odd dark stain on the walls, and it took my brain far too long to clue into what it was. The walls and floors were also covered with weapon and claw marks. The Agents who used this area to train fought the monsters that came through from the other world. I realized after seeing so many of those dark red stains that not everyone made it out in one piece. This wasn’t some simple training like doing laps or pushups. These caves were trial by fire. Jackalope's smile didn’t fade but I heard a slight strain in his voice. \n\n“I was one, but I got fired.” He admitted. \n\nI pressed my lips together regretting another thing I said to him. I didn’t really know much about The Corporation. I heard they protected humans from monsters and hired creatures to do so. The Hunters sort of did the same thing. But they hated all creatures and only used humans to hunt them down to slaughter everyone they came across, regardless If they were dangerous to humans or not. From what I could tell, Agents were respected in the supernatural community even if they killed their own kind. Getting fired must be a black spot that followed around Jackalope. He didn’t let it show how much it bothered him. \n\nWe worked in silence for a while. He let me collect some boxes that people on the upper floors sent down. I organized them and he brought them deeper into the caves. He needed some help with heavier boxes, so we both took one end and ended up pretty far into a room hidden off to the side. He set down the wooden crate we just hauled and told me we could take a break. We were close to finishing the job and everyone else above us should be taking a break around that time. I sat on the box with him and offered the snack Sunny packed for Max. My friend would forgive me for giving away the snack of the day. \n\n“This... is a rude question but could I ask you something? You don’t need to answer.” I started. \n\nHe turned his head, the kind smile showing he would answer any question I had no matter what it was. I know I shouldn’t pry when it came to something so sensitive, but after seeing his missing arm I wanted to know why he didn’t have a replacement. \n\n“Your arm... I lost mine and they replaced it quickly. I’m just not sure why they didn’t do the same with you.” I asked. \n\nHe appeared surprised for half a second. He held out his hand and quietly asked to see my replacement arm. I let him take my left hand and turn it over in his. \n\n“The replacements haven’t stuck with me. Yours is very well made. It seems as if you have some sort of defense magic inside this one.” He commented and let me take my hand back. \n\n“What do you mean?” I asked looking over my own hand in the dim green light. \n\n“Most arms can activate and turn into a weapon if your life is in danger. It's insurance to make sure you don’t lose another one. But because you’re human, the arm doesn’t have any magic to feed off to transform. It may have absorbed some power just by being around creatures though. I doubt anyone has told you about this because of the slim chances of it working, and they want you to stay safe. I bet you might be more reckless if you knew your false arm could become a weapon.” Jackalope explained. \n\nThat made sense. After everything I've been through my arm didn’t show any sign of becoming a weapon. It was just a normal arm that would feel stiff if I didn’t play fetch with Max every week. At least he was glad to spend a few hours with me in the park. Even after finding out this information, I didn’t plan on relying on a weapon that I might not have. \n\n“I hope losing it wasn’t too traumatizing for you. You seem to be doing well after what happened.” My co-worker added. \n\nI hadn’t thought about that in a while. I did hurt a lot when I chopped it off. But I was lucky that the mailing company healed me with magic, so the recovery process went by quickly. \n\n“I cut it off to save my friend's life. I think because I became friends with who ate it really helped me get over the entire thing.” I said now fully realizing how lucky I was. \n\nJackalope’s face turned into such a kind expression it made my heart skip a beat. I wasn’t interested in him, but this guy could win over anyone. He stood from the box as a signal our break was over, but he didn’t start walking just yet. \n\n“I feel the same. I was ready to sacrifice my life to save a man I just met. He didn’t see himself as much, however... he wanted to live, and I wanted him to carry on. By some luck, I only lost my arm and some other minor injuries.” He said but trailed off making me think the injuries weren’t as minor as he wanted to play them off as. \n\n“Are... you alright with the outcome?” I asked him, feeling the air heavy between us. \n\n“I don’t regret giving up what I did. I see it as an investment. That man started to do a lot trying to feel as if his life was worth it. He's donated blood and volunteered a lot of his time to help the community. At first, those actions were for stressful reasons but he’s really enjoying living. That’s well worth the cost of my arm.” Jackalope said, his tone brightening a lot. \n\nHis words carried hints of pain. I could tell he held onto a great deal of what happened to him in the past I might never know about. But now he could smile freely. I doubted he could have done the same when he worked as an Agent. Giving up an arm might have been the best thing that ever happened to him. \n\n“Are you still friends with him?” I asked, hoping that was the case. \n\nHis response was to raise his right hand to show off a black ring I hadn’t noticed before. His expression filled with pride made me happy. I wanted nothing more than for my co-workers to be able to have good lives. Even if we all had a dangerous job. I knew firsthand that nearly getting killed every other day was worth it for the people we met through work. \n\n“We need to get going. We spent too long, and I think people-” \n\nJackalope stared but his words got cut off by terrible ripping and crashing sounds that tore through the cave. He started moving and grabbed my arm to drag me along before the sounds even stopped. I wasn’t sure of what happened but knew this was bad if he acted so frantic. We ran out to the main cavern and the elevator looked too far for comfort. More noise made me look over my shoulder and I wish I hadn’t. \n\nA swarm of creatures started to pour out of a tear appearing into the stone wall. Inside the rip were so many of those creatures they couldn’t fit through. They looked a bit human with pale white skin. They ran on all fours with eyeless faces. Their mouths so large it nearly split their heads in half. Teeth longer than my hand was crammed together in that terrible mouth ready to dig into flesh. I saw ribs and countless scars on the creatures. The rip had only been open for a few seconds and yet at least a hundred, if not more, of them poured through. \n\nJackalope pushed me ahead of him and he stopped ready to face the monsters. I hesitated for a second, wanting to stay with him. I knew I couldn’t help him and regretted the fact I needed to run away. Since the magic eaters already tore through the world, Jackalope didn’t need to worry about not using magic. He swiftly unzipped his jacket to pull a thin black blade from his chest. The moment the magic eaters got close enough, the blade came down on them, easily slicing their bodies to pieces. \n\nThe creatures flew into a frenzy. They fell on their fallen and turned savage against Jackalope trying to eat his magic. Some even bit down on his blade trying to devour it. I reached the elevator, but the doors stayed shut. I guessed it sealed automatically after the rip in the worlds opened to keep the monsters from reaching the top floor. I looked around, fear settling in my stomach. I didn’t know of any other way to get out of this cave. \n\nI turned around to ask Jackalope for help, worried he wouldn’t be able to do so while he fought. He already killed over a hundred of those creatures. Still, more poured through. They crawled over the walls and crowed the ceiling. They were so focused on Jackalope none had tried to make their way toward me just yet. \n\nMy co-worker had been an Agent for a reason. His body moved gracefully taking down those monsters almost as fast as they could appear. He didn’t stay still, his footwork perfect as he jumped off creatures to land a killing blow on the others that clawed at him. Even without an arm, Jackalope was strong as hell. As he fought a set of black antlers sprouted from his head. The horns were so dark they absorbed all the light they touched. \n\nDread started to come to me as I saw his attacks change. He grew messy after the appearance of the antlers. The darkness crept up his neck and his good hand holding the blade turned black as well. His face lost the kind gentle expression. His eyes wide and hungry to kill as many creatures as possible. I knew if he didn’t get control over himself, neither of us would make it out of there. \n\n“Jackie!” I shouted, my voice echoing and alerting the magic eaters. \n\nHis expression snapped back to something human. For a moment he paused unaware of where he stood. A monster latched itself onto his arm, but his uniform saved him from any damage. \n\n“The stairs!” He shouted over his shoulder. \n\nWith a sharp kick, he broke free of the crowd to run towards an opening I assumed to be another room. I reached it first and saw a set of stairs carved into the rock. I bolted upwards glad that my job required me to run so often. If I did this a year ago, I would have passed out after five steps. \n\nThe narrow opening caused fewer creatures to get through. Jackalope took up the rear killing as many as he could. He and the creatures were gaining on us. I feared that we might not make it. And after we died, there was nothing to stop these monsters to attack our co-workers on the other levels. They were only a little bit more powerful than me. None of them would stand a chance against these monsters. \n\n“Toby, turtle maneuver!” Jackalope shouted from below. \n\nI stopped in my tracks and huddled into myself. The delivery workers had a move where we covered ourselves with as much of our uniform as possible making us look like turtles hiding away in our shells. No matter how silly it looked, it worked. I missed what Jackalope did, but a blast of power came from him. It nearly knocked me forwards and into the hard stone steps. \n\nThings grew quiet as the sounds of the magic eaters died down. I pulled my head from the collar of my jacket to look down at a sight that made my heart sink. Jackalope collapsed on the steps, his breathing heavy and ragged. I ran down to him trying to get my new friend back on his feet. Black blood came from his nose, and he could barely keep his eyes open. Whatever he did blew away some of those creatures, but I heard another hoard on the way. \n\n“Go. I’ll slow them down.” He said, his voice a whisper. \n\nI knew what he meant. He wasn’t strong enough to kill that many more creatures. If he let them eat him, he might keep enough away for me to get to the second floor. \n\n“No! I'm not-” \n\nHe stumbled on a step and bumped into me. His knee knocked on my pocket and made a bulky object fall out of my jacket. It landed on the steps, and I looked down to see what it was. I’d completely forgotten I had it, and never once used it since I got it. Hope ran through my chest as my hand landed on the gift from a kind, and yet terrifying monster who loved humans. \n\n“You’re fine with sunlight, right?” I asked. \n\nJackalope appeared confused. He nodded his head. Some creatures couldn’t deal with sunlight all that well. If they weren’t wearing their uniform, it could drain their strength or even kill the weaker ones. Max would get worn out if he didn’t wear his uniform in the daylight. I learned that the hard way when we played fetch in the park, and he forgot his jacket. A swarm of the magic eaters started to fill the stairway interrupting my thoughts. \n\nI wasn’t sure how to use the Sunlight I’d long forgotten about. I pointed it down towards the creatures and flicked the switch, hoping for the best. Whatever I expected, it wasn’t what happened. \n\nOur vision was blinded by light for a few seconds. I heard the screams of all the magic eaters at once as the intense sunlight hit them. I assumed the sunlight would have just been a bright beam. But it filled the entire cave. As the first flash faded, my eyes adjusted to the light. It really looked like daytime inside the cave.  \n\nWe stared down at where the magic eaters had been to only see scorched black spots against the rocks. I didn’t have any clue how long the sunlight would last, so we moved as fast as the injured Jackalope could up the stairs. \n\nBy some miracle, we made it to the top floor with no issues. The cave was empty, which made me a little nervous. Jackalope recovered enough to walk on his own. By the time we left the cave, my Sunlight turned off sending the entire area back into darkness. \n\nWe were greeted by a crowd outside. Some of my co-workers looked a bit beat up but all alive. I saw Max standing in the distance with Rufus who held him tight. I bet it was scary for all the family members to hear that we were all in the cave when the tear opened. It was luck that no one died. If Trin hadn’t given me the Sunlight, we would have lost so many people. \n\nJackalope saw someone who had just arrived. A human with tan skin and dark hair came weaving through the crowd towards us. Jackalope went over to the man and brought him into a hug assuring him he was alright. I looked over the crowd happy to see all the relieved family members and friends embracing my co-workers that made it out of the cave alive. And an ugly emotion came over me. I pushed it down, but it was there for a few seconds. \n\nUnlike everyone else, when I came out of the cave no one had been waiting for me. I shook off the feeling hating myself for it. Max was here. And Rufus. They just saw each other first. Max finally saw me and ran over. But he didn’t scoop me in in a hug as I expected. He pointed to the cave to my confusion. \n\n“Walk in and back out.” He ordered. \n\nI didn’t understand why but I did what I was told. I took a step inside the deadly cave, then walked back to Max. His eyes started to water, and he scooped me up in the hug I expected to start with. \n\n“I was so worried!” He cried. \n\nI realized that he noticed I was the only one who walked out of the cave without someone greeting me. He wanted to fix that. Rufus came over to give up both a crushing hug. It took a very long time to get Max calm enough to let go of me. Even though my uniform, my ribs felt bruised.  \n\n“What happened inside?” Rufus asked the most important question. \n\nI wanted to explain how we all made it out alive. But we interrupted when another person came through the open door from the Zero room. Sunny spotted us and rushed over. He jumped and I needed to catch him in my arms so he wouldn’t fall flat on his face. Belizas came after him but didn’t stay. She ran into the cave very excitedly, saying she was a part of the cleanup crew. If there were any more magic eaters, she gladly wanted to punch them. \n\n“I was so worried!” Sunny said sounding a lot like Max at that moment. \n\nHe also refused to let me go. I was fine with that. When Sunny got upset, he became what I called wobbly. His body grew a little tacky and he wasn’t able to keep a sharp solid shape. When he cried, he looked more like a wiggling pile of jello with vaguely human features. I worried he may fall apart so I kept a hold of him. Sunny had a rough day. His support group meeting went well. The other creatures of his species loved him. They were all so glad one of them was able to go to a good home before they got forced into certain things. I gave them all hope for the future of their race. On top of dealing with all that, he heard his roommate nearly died. No wonder he got so emotional. \n\nYet again, I could have died. And I would most likely have a new fear of caves. God, I wished I didn’t gain new nightmare fuel almost every day at work. But on the days I made it out safely I now knew I always had someone waiting for me to make it home safely. We would share a decent meal that chased away some of the fears from the day.",

        "text": "I have a long history in scouting, I was a Girl Scout for 13 years and sometimes went on trips with my brothers’ Boy Scout troop, even teaching them archery on occasion. I’ve got mixed feelings about my time in scouts, in part because of the groups themselves but also because scout activities always seemed to get me into trouble. \n\nThis story happened during Girl Scout cookie season. To be honest, I’m pretty jealous of scouts now, getting to use apps to sell Thin Mints and Caramel Delights. I feel like an old person yelling “Back in my day!” but it’s true. Back in my day (late 90s-early 2010s), if we weren’t selling at booths outside grocery stores, we were going door to door, order forms in hand.\n\nI dreaded this method, talking to people let alone strangers was never my strong suit but year after year, my mom made sure I at least made the rounds in my local neighborhood. At first it wasn’t too hard to get a long list of orders but as I got older, trading pigtails for braces, I was no longer too cute to say no to. The recession probably didn’t help either. \n\nThe year I turned twelve, my mom said I could go door to door unsupervised. The residential streets of suburbia felt safe enough and I had already been walking home from school alone for years. My parents had taken away my cell phone as well (their favored punishment) so it wasn’t like I could call my friends to go hang out. To make sure I actually did knock on doors instead of just pretending, my mom told me not to come back until I had gotten at least fifteen orders. \n\nSo I set off, wearing my blue green sash with clipboard in hand. It was one of those warmer days that tricked you into thinking Spring had already arrived and within half a block, I was already a little sweaty.\n\nNo one answered the first few doors I knocked on. Any No Solicitors signs made me both relieved I wouldn’t have to even try and nervous that it’d take me all day to get the orders I needed. A block over, someone finally answered, happy to order from this awkward preteen. Four boxes of Peanut Butter Patties. Disgusting. (I’m a Trefoils fan)\n\nAn hour passed and I was a number of orders in when I came to the Estrada house. Señora Estrada had always made sure to buy one box from me every year, lamenting how she wished her daughter had stuck with Girl Scouts like me. Cecilia was much older than myself and had been really into sports, her gear always littering the front porch until she had gone off to college on a sports scholarship. \n\nI eagerly walked up to the door, flowers just blooming along the walkway, dots of color against the green. I prepared my best sales smile and rang the door bell. \n\nNo answer. \n\nAgain I rang and again, no answer. I knocked firmly on the door and to my surprise, it swung open. The familiar porcelain cross on the wall faced me, hanging next to the family photo and a mirror which only reflected the blank hallway. \n\n“Hello? Señora Estrada? It’s Eliana, the Girl Scout? I’m here for your cookie order.”\n\nI waited. Silence. \n\n“Señora, your door was open. Are you home?” Now I leaned in, holding my breath, listening. \n\nA low moan sounded from somewhere inside. \n\nI froze, that horrible sound locking every one of my joints. I could just close the door, leave and forget about it. But what if it was Señora Estrada, hurt and in need of help? I was, after all, a Girl Scout certified in first aid. I stood there, heart hammering, trying to collect myself enough to decide what to do. \n\nI stepped inside. The front hallway wasn’t much cooler than the porch but I was still grateful to be out of the sun. I spied a row of shoes by the door and slipped off my own, years of habit dictating my actions. \n\n“Señora Estrada?” I called again, my voice muted, quavering in the stillness. \n\nThe low moan sounded again. \n\nI slowly walked forward, tiptoeing. It was then that the smell wafted over me. A hint of something like burnt garbage, still rotting. My stomach felt like a rock had dropped into it. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye and I turned. \n\nIt was only my reflection in the mirror. \n\nI let out a breath and continued, going down the left side hallway instead of the right. This led me to a cozy living room. Colorful blankets draped over the couch and a few photos hung on the wall. A couple were first communion photos of Cecilia and her brother alongside graduation celebrations, their mother smiling proudly from the frames. The smell was worse here, a sickening odor that almost made me turn back. But the woman herself was nowhere in the room and so I had to keep going. \n\nA doorway on the other side led to what I presumed would be a dining area or kitchen so I headed in that direction, my ears straining to hear anything. \n\nMovement, like something dragging on the ground, and that same low moan. \n\nI moved quicker, now more certain that something bad had happened to her. I stepped out of the living room into a dining area. I gagged at the smell now, all the more worse for how unique it was, something I had never smelled before, something that screamed danger to my brain. I held my uniform sash over my mouth and nose, looking around the room. I saw papers in disarray on the table besides stacks of dirty dishes. The chairs had been knocked over and worst of all…\n\nA dark fluid smeared on the floor, going through the doorway to the kitchen. \n\n“Señora Estrada?” I said again, rushing forward, the carpet turning to tile beneath my feet. I felt my socks soak up the liquid on the floor, inescapable as what I saw in that kitchen.\n\nSeñora Estrada lay on the floor, having dragged her body from the dining room, leaving behind what looked like bits and pieces of her as she went. There was blood, yes, but something had happened to her body beyond that, the skin mottled and decayed in between the missing stripes of flesh. Her usually full head of hair was falling out in clumps, sticking to the gobs of viscous liquid on the floor. Flashes of bone shone through flaps of muscle.\n\nBile rose in my throat but I swallowed it back down, my mind reeling. I must have collapsed because one moment I was upright and the next I was on the ground, my legs and arms shaking. I grabbed a drawer handle with one hand, pulling myself up again, anything to get out of that pool of putrefaction. \n\nI had fallen by her feet, her body laid out, stretching in the direction of the phone on the far wall, beside the other kitchen doorway. Every atom in my body screamed at me to run and yet I found myself leaning forward to look at her face. \n\nHer eyes locked on mine and I saw her blink once, twice. She was still alive. \n\n“Señora.” I gasped. “What happened to you?” \n\nAnother blink. She was alive and needed help. I was a Girl Scout and was supposed to give help. I was supposed to know what to do or find someone who did. Find someone who did. I looked to the kitchen phone. Of course, of course, 911 would know what to do. \n\nI walked over to it, careful not to slip. I dialed, but when the operator answered, I couldn’t speak. I tried, I swear to you, I tried. But all I could do was open my mouth and let out a sob. I stood that way for a few minutes while the operator tried to coax information out of me, anything to help, but it was no good. I couldn’t do the one thing I knew I had to do. \n\nThe only benefit of staying on the line so long was that they could figure out the address of Señora Estrada’s landline. When they told me people were on the way, I dropped the phone, watching it bounce then spin on its spiral cord. \n\nI turned back to Señora Estrada, the woman who had bought cookies from me every year, offering me a Chupa Chup whenever I finally delivered her order. I couldn’t see her face, couldn’t see her eyes blink as a sign of life. I needed her to be alive, to stay alive long enough for help to come.\n\nI knelt beside her. “On their way.” I croaked but there was no response. No blink, no moan. I felt my heart beat faster. My hands hovered over her, shaking, searching for a way to help. To take back whatever had happened. I thought maybe I could apply pressure to some wound or stabilize a break but her body was beyond my pitiful first aid certification. She was gone. \n\nAs I stared at her body, I heard footsteps approaching. \n\n“Mamá, I hope you’ve had time to think. I finished mixing your ointment.” the voice cut off the same time the footsteps stopped in the doorway beside the kitchen phone. I wrenched my gaze upwards. \n\nThere stood Cecilia, older than the photos I’d seen in the living room but still fairly young. Her eyes narrowed at me, I didn’t know what to say. I don’t think I could say anything. \n\n“What are you doing here?” Something in her body language shifted, it felt like she was filling the doorway, directing all of her poisonous attention on me. It was then she heard the faint sound of the 911 operator checking in, trying to see if I was okay. She calmly bent down, never taking her eyes off of me, and hung up the phone. \n\n“You must be the fucking Girl Scout my mother loves so much.” She inhaled deeply, then let it all out again. “And now they’ll be here before I can put her back together, so what am I gonna do with you.”\n\nIt was a statement, not a question. I could tell she knew exactly what she was going to do with me, to me. Blood pounded in my ears, hands and feet turning to ice. I willed myself to move, to speak, to do anything. \n\nI felt the smallest nudge on my knee and I glanced down. Señora Estrada’s hand leaned against me. I had been wrong, she was alive. Alive and looking back up at me, releasing one last gasp of sound. “Uuuuunnnnnnn.”\n\nRun. \n\nThe word released me from my paralysis. I ran, turning on the slick floor to get away from Cecilia. She lunged after me, years of sports on her side. Of course, she wasn’t the only one who littered their front porch with cleats and shinguards. I knew how to sprint as if my life depended on it. \n\nThrough the kitchen doorway, the dining room, the living room. There, there was the front door, just within reach. Cecilia tackled me from behind and we both crashed to the ground.  Her fingernails tore at my skin but I managed to kick her shoulder. She let out a grunt and I slipped from her hold, scrambling up, propelling myself as hard as I could to the outside, to freedom.\n\nI couldn’t see the ambulance, couldn’t see any hope of salvation so I kept running, not stopping until I made it to my own front door. Once inside, I collapsed, unable to respond to my mother’s shaking and questions “What happened? Who did this to you? Where are your shoes?”\n\nLater that night, after a trip to urgent care, the phone rang. I hadn’t said a word all day but I still got up to answer it, savoring the routine motions. The vaguest sense of normalcy. \n\n“Is this the XXXXXX residence? I’d like to speak to Eliana.” I simply stood there, barely breathing at the sound of that voice. “Must be you. Don’t tell anyone unless you want your mother to look like mine.” A click and the call was over. My mom asked who it was and it was then that I found my voice. “Wrong number.” \n\nEventually there was a funeral, closed casket. My parents never connected the date of Señora Estrada’s death with what had happened to me. They thought I had been beaten up by some shitty teen boys or hit by a driver who wasn’t paying attention. As a result, I was off the hook for door to door cookie sales. Apparently danger did lurk in suburbia.\n\nI thought about not going to the funeral service but a part of me felt that wouldn’t be right. I had to, for her. Señora Estrada deserved that much. I managed to hold it together until Cecilia got up to speak. \n\n“I prepared some words but they all seem so meaningless now. I want to speak from my heart but…” She looked up, her eyes glittering with tears. “My heart is broken. Mi mamá… I want to remember her as she really was, not what I saw when I came home to visit. The memories you’ve all been sharing with me and Matías, it’s like you’re all giving me pieces of my mother back. But these pieces can never make her whole again.” When her gaze fell on me, I thought I saw her smirk. She dabbed her eyes and gave a small laugh. “Right now she’d say ‘¡Ay, Dios mío! mija, you make me sound so sad, get to the good parts.’” The mourners laughed at that too. I stood up from my pew in the back. “So I’ll share a story about her. I think you all knew how much loved her garden…”\n\nThe rest of her words faded as I left the church, unable to stomach it any longer. \n\nTime passed. I didn’t relax exactly but you know how memory is. We bury what we don’t want to think about. Until soccer season rolled around again and I found myself digging through the pile of gear on the porch. There, placed carefully side by side were the sneakers I’d taken off in the Estrada house.\n\nA reminder. A promise.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ny75a/aita_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my_roommates/",
        "text": "My roommate made up a game in which she sews together a creepy sock doll and pretends it’s alive a la Elf on the Shelf, and asked me to join. I mean, would *you* play that game? Why not name the doll “Chuckie” while you’re at it?\n\nRight so… I played it.\n\nAnd let me preface this by saying last I checked I was of sound mind, excepting my dubious choice of major, philosophy (a degree that will allow me to think very deeply about the universe and my lack of employment in it). I am a scholar and a skeptic, and wouldn’t believe any of the account I’m about to give if I hadn’t seen the doll move myself.\n\nThe doll, or rather, *whatever evil force is moving the doll,* is real. It is walking around my house. It may or may not have disappeared our hamster (who often escapes her cage anyway, so it could all be a coincidence—but still, as of this moment, Binky is missing).\n\nSo—prank? Elaborate puppetry? Hallucinatory episode? I hate all of those options, but since I can’t come up with any better explanation—hive mind, willing to help me science this thing?\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n**The scenario:**\n\nI, Plato,\\* am a fourth year philosophy student—a major that explains why I am still broke and single (folks, pardon me if you’ve heard some of these jokes before, they’re obligatory for my philosophy degree). I live in a house with three roommates: Karen, Binky the hamster, and Curt.\n\nIt all started a few days ago with Karen’s fab new idea to promote her channel. Karen is pursuing her degree in motivational makeup tutorials and clickbait (or as she calls it, *marketing*). She frequently drags Binky and me into her ongoing quest for likes, shares, and subscribers. Much as I’m apt to criticize the vapidity of our modern-day scramble for clicks, the hamster has more followers than I have job options. Anyway, Karen opened her proposal with, “Hey, this year for Halloween, we should play the doll game!”\n\n“The doll game?” I said.\n\n“The doll game!” she enthused. “It’s like Elf on the Shelf, but you play on Halloween instead of Christmas, and you use a doll you make yourself.”\n\nElf on the Shelf? I’d rather play Stye on the Eye. (It’s where I get a stye on my eye and go to the doctor rather than having to play this game… And ok, in my defense, it’s hard to come up with catchy rhymes on the fly—speaking of which—)\n\n“This game sounds made up… did you make it up? Is this for your tiktok?”\n\n“No!” She said with huge doe eyes, lashes fluttering.\n\nI side-eyed her. “And it’s called the doll game? Doesn’t it need a catchy name that’ll let people know right away what it is? Like Elf on the Shelf?”\n\n“Doll in the Hall!”\n\nFolks, the brilliance that is Karen.\n\n“Sure, I guess, for Halloween,” said I—I, knowing we are in March, and I’d have a full seven months before my required participation. This is a bad habit of mine—present-me often makes commitments that future-me regrets.\n\nCue Karen, swooping in with a dose of instant karma for present-me: “Oh good, you’ll do it? Sweet! We don’t have to wait for Halloween. We can try it now and see how things go, and do it again if it’s popular!”\n\nI felt sort of tricked. But, fine. We were playing “Doll in the Hall.” Not that our apartment *has* a hall (details, schmetails). Apparently, it was a riff on some creepy game Karen found that went viral circa 2006, called Hitori Kakurenbo because it’s a Japanese horror game (of course it is). This translates more or less to “Hide and Seek Alone,” in which you make a doll, stuff it with rice and a bit of hair or fingernails (ah yes, the horror flavor text—because handmade dolls aren’t creepy enough), and then put it in the bathtub. Stab the doll with a sharp object and tell it, “You’re it.” You go and hide, count to ten, and the doll comes searching for you. If it catches you, it kills you with whatever implement you stabbed it with.\n\nWin, and you… well, I guess you win a creepy doll.\n\nBut you also *lose*, because you spent hours making that doll whose only purpose is to kill you. (And truly, do we blame the doll on this one? You created it, you brought it into this world, and then you stabbed it. *You monster.*)\n\nTruly a game where there are no winners, only sincere regrets.\n\nFortunately, Karen’s version, “Doll in the Hall,” doesn’t involve stabbing (Yay! Score one for lack of cruelty-to-dolls). Instead, in the days leading up to Halloween, you move the doll around, similar to the elf on the shelf. On Halloween, it comes to life for real when the spirits inhabit it.\n\nNothing about this could go wrong, surely.\n\nBut we were playing in March so, in Karen’s words, “It probably won’t come to life.” Right. Natch.\n\nNow, my general reluctance to play had nothing to do with fears of the doll actually coming to life (oh, if only I knew then!). I just figured it would be a pain in the butt to play along for the camera every time Karen wanted to upload a new video tracking the movements of her homemade frankendoll, and expecting me to be a willing actor. But it’s not like she had a lot of options. Binky was already the star of 80% of her content, and our other housemate, Curt… well, was Curt.\n\nSo, Doll in the Hall!\n\n“Sure,” I said. “Let the games begin.”\n\nKaren squealed in delight, and actually hugged me, which made my heart palpitate a little bit because I have a small unrequited crush on her. Then she asked for a clipping of my hair or nails and I immediately regretted every life choice I’d ever made that had lead me to this moment.\n\nFingernail clippings? Gross.\n\nA lock of hair it was!\n\nMe, Binky, Karen—locks from each of us went in.\n\nThe doll, sewn by Karen out of socks, looked like what can only be described as the horrific lovechild of a demented sock monkey and a junkie elf on the shelf fallen on hard times. It had mismatched buttons for eyes, sock arms and legs, and a wire skeleton so that it could be extra terrifying (Quoth Karen, “It’s *not* for scariness, it’s so it can be bent to different poses!”). I vetoed rice as a filling material. I wasn’t about to let her waste that much rice, nor was I willing to eat said rice after it had been mixed in with our hair clippings. So she used cotton stuffing. Some of our hair went in with the cotton, but she used most of it to make these weird little pigtails sticking off the top of its head.\n\nCute.\n\nOnce it was finished, we all sat around for a naming ceremony, which was really just an excuse for Karen to make a promotional video.\n\nI suggested Cuddles.\n\nKaren wanted to call it Boo Boy, presumably so she could call it her “boo” for short.\n\nBinky had the deciding vote, and no surprise, voted with Karen.\n\nBoo Boy it was.\n\n**The Game Begins:**\n\nBoo Boy spent the next few days appearing and disappearing from various locations around the house. Karen generally played dumb, asking me in that Bambi-eyed way she always did when lying, “Did you move Boo Boy? I can’t find him!”\n\nMagnanimously, I played along. There was one day when we really couldn’t find him. I could tell because Karen came to me, asking where he was with a sly look—apparently she thought *I’d* moved him and was getting more pro-active about being in the game. (I wasn’t. I may have been volunteered like a reluctant audience member pulled onto the stage for the magician’s act—but I had no plans to cross the line from audience participant to magician’s assistant. I’ve seen what they do to those assistants when they put them in the boxes and bring out the saw!) When I did my usual schtick of “gosh where could he be,” and she realized I didn’t actually know, she panicked.\n\nTurned out it was Curt who had him.\n\nCurt seldom interacts with us and isn’t a student. As to what he does… mafia hitman, caveman method actor, head summoner for a Cthulhu-worshipping cult bent on bringing a reign of supernatural terror into the world? Pretty much nothing would surprise me. He showed up with Boo Boy in hand, demanding, “What the fuck is this voodoo shit?”\n\nI giggled nervously while Karen took out her phone to film.\n\nCurt snapped at her to get that camera out of his face and warned that it’s a bad idea to mess with “black magic fuckery.” Then he stormed off, telling us he wasn’t going to be involved in the game and he wasn’t responsible for “whatever bad shit goes down.”\n\nThis was probably the most Curt had spoken to either of us in six months. I was a little concerned by his outburst. Not—again—because of any fears of the supernatural, but because I prefer to keep the peace between us. Also, it is his house.\n\nKaren, for her part, was delighted by Curt’s overreaction, and shut herself up in her room with Boo Boy to make another video about it.\n\nSo far so normal.\n\nBut then… last week, things started getting weird. For example, on Monday, I was sitting on the couch, reading (philosophy, natch. I’m kidding. I was on Tiktok watching people ascend mountains of milk crates. OH GOD I’M PART OF THE PROBLEM). *Ahem*. I was lost in videos of people tumbling from crate piles like inept mountain goats, and Karen was trying various filters on Binky (Binky with bunny ears! Binky with human teeth— *shudder* —Binky Karen face swap!). Suddenly, Curt’s door burst open. He hurled Boo Boy at us, his voice shaking with fury:\n\n“I *TOLD* you not to involve me in your voodoo shit! It’s not fucking funny! Next time *EITHER* of you leaves this piece of shit ratfucking dark magic *thing* in my room, I will rip it up and burn it!”\n\nHe slammed the door.\n\nKaren burst out laughing.\n\n“Oh my god!” she cried. “Oh my god, I wish I’d had that on video! That was soooo good! Well played, Plato, that was awesome!”\n\n“It wasn’t me,” I said, frowning.\n\n“Next time tell me you’re gonna do that so I can record it!”\n\n“Um, did you hear him? I don’t think there’s going to *be* a next time if you want Boo Boy to make it to the end of this game. Also, *it wasn’t me*.”\n\n“Sure it wasn’t,” She snickered, and winked.\n\nWinking is something Karen does in her videos to try and look conspiratorial with the audience. Being the subject of a wink made me think that, possibly, she was in on the whole thing and had done it after all. Although…\n\nWeird, that she wouldn’t have her phone ready to record, had she set that up.\n\nAfter that incident, Boo Boy would periodically vanish and reappear in places that neither Karen nor I could explain. I assumed it was her doing (and she, presumably, assumed it was me). None of the places were that unusual. We’d find him sitting on the shelf in our rooms, or in the fridge apparently raiding the meat drawer, hidden under the bed with his arms propped under his chin so he could look out, or peeking up at us from a drawer that was mostly closed. He seemed especially prone to appearing around Binky’s cage, but I assumed that was just so Karen could get both Binky and Boo Boy in her videos.\n\nThen Binky disappeared.\n\n“All right, enough is enough,” Karen announced, in a tone that indicated she was genuinely upset, though at the time I had no idea why. “Where is Binky?”\n\n“Huh? I don’t know. She’s not in her cage?”\n\n“If she was in her cage, would I be asking?”\n\n“Maybe she escaped.”\n\n“Look, the top is off the cage and the bedding is a mess inside. It’s obvious she was chased around by someone trying to grab her. Where did you put her?”\n\n“I don’t know why you’re coming at me. Maybe Curt let her out for some reason. But it certainly wasn’t me.”\n\n“Curt’s out of town. He left yesterday, remember? Binky was still in her cage.”\n\n“Really?” I didn’t remember. Curt leaving for a week or two at a stretch was not unusual. I just didn’t bother to keep track of it.\n\nKaren wouldn’t back down. She genuinely thought I stole her hamster, and possibly even did something to her. Why would I ever hurt Binky? I’m a vegetarian. I can’t even watch movies where animals get hurt. A horror movie where the cat yowls, or the dog runs out barking and then yelps in pain? I’m out. I told her this, and Karen shouted, “So did you take her to *liberate* her then? Because you *hate* cages?”\n\n“You’re being ridiculous,” I snapped—which wasn’t my most diplomatic, but I was feeling defensive. I don’t lie. I never lie. And I wouldn’t “liberate” a domesticated hamster from what is honestly a pretty cushy life, even if Binky *is* an unwilling social media star. Like most influencers, she’d never make it in the wild. I pointed this out to Karen, but she was hysterical, worried about her Binky, and retreated to her room crying.\n\nI felt bad for a few moments. In my attempt to defuse her accusations with humor, I might have appeared to make light of the situation. In fact, I was very worried for Binky, too. I looked over at Binky’s cage—\n\nI froze, chilled.\n\nThere were two button eyes looking out at me from the edge of the bookshelf beside the cage.\n\nBoo Boy’s mismatched eyes and little pigtails bore an expression that, if I were to anthropomorphize a doll, I’d term *naughty. Mischievous.*\n\n*EVIL.*\n\nI stared for a moment, and without taking my gaze off it, called, “Hey, Karen, did you move Boo Boy?”\n\nNo response.\n\nIf she found Boo Boy by the cage later, she’d definitely get upset. She’d likely assume I put him there and was messing with her. I grabbed the doll.\n\nBits of wood shaving clung to its sock arm.\n\nFrowning, I plucked off the shavings.\n\nIn hindsight, this should have been a red flag roughly the size of Mars. The equivalent of the moment in a horror movie when the camera pans to the killer doll sitting smiling with the missing dog’s bloody collar in its porcelain fingers. The moment I usually nope out of any such film. But as I’ve said before—I, a rational person, do not believe in ghosts. I assumed that a) Curt had set this up before he left to pay us back for pranking him that one time, or b) Karen had set it all up herself, and was now engaged in an elaborate dramatization, all in service to the gods of social media fame. And if it weren’t for what happened later that night, I’d still assume this to be the most plausible explanation, and I’d be posting on AITA with my fellow jerks, instead of here, on nosleep, with you spooky kookies… of which I guess I am now one (how do you do, fellow ghostbusting kids?)\n\nAnyway, I decided I’d had enough of Boo Boy, and the best thing to do to end this before her game got way out of hand was to destroy it.\n\n**First Steps:**\n\nI took Boo Boy into the kitchen and snipped its arm off with scissors. I was intending to cut it up and toss it in the trash. Only… while I was cutting, I began to feel a shade of remorse. After all, Karen’s videos were important to her. She’d put a lot of time into this “Doll in the Hall” series. And if I destroyed the doll now, she wouldn’t finish. The least I could do was destroy it on video for her.\n\nPlus if I destroyed it, I might ruin our relationship as amicable roomies.\n\nSo, while I considered her accusations about Binky to be wildly overstepping, I retracted my behavior. I sewed back the arm and considered. What to do with the doll, then? Eventually, I settled on hiding it. I’d agree to give it back if she stopped taking things too far and promised to wrap up the game.\n\nI hid the doll inside a lockbox with my birth certificate, social security card, and other docs. A place Karen wouldn’t dare search, and from which Boo Boy couldn’t escape—I chastised myself for this thought almost as soon as I had it. Even so, I made sure the box was extra locked, and tied a ribbon on it for good measure, before shoving it deep into my closet. The key remained on my person. Karen was still holed up in her room—I could hear her making a video about Binky’s disappearance and asking her followers for advice. This seemed to confirm my theory that the whole thing was an elaborate circus act for clicks. Presumably, she’d blame the doll later and the show would go on. Fabulous.\n\nI buried myself in my reading, and thought nothing more of it that night. Eventually, I went to sleep.\n\nI woke in the dark in the dead of night. At first I wasn’t sure what had awoken me, but when I clicked the light on, I frowned, because my closet door was ajar.\n\nA faint whisper—a rustling—drifted to my ears from the carpeted floor just outside my door.\n\n“Binky?” I wondered.\n\nMaybe Binky really had escaped, somehow.\n\nI got up, padding softly to the door, and opened it. The darkness out in the living room area was too complete for me to make out anything but dim shapes, but I’d definitely caught the sound of scurrying just before I’d reached the door, like something darting away toward the sofa. I fumbled round for a moment along the wall and then flicked a switch.\n\nMy heart dropped to my toes. It’s lucky I didn’t have to pee, because if there’d been anything in my bladder, I’d have emptied it.\n\nThe doll—Boo Boy—was *walking.* It took two running steps along the sofa before, like Woody in Toy Story worried about being caught, it abruptly froze. Froze, and remained frozen, as if it had been posed there.\n\nI stared.\n\nThe doll (it seemed) stared back.\n\n“Karen?” I called. But there was no response. Presumably Karen was sound asleep. I strode over to the doll and snatched it up, half expecting it to come to life and writhe like a viper in my grip. But it was just a doll. Its button eyes, though, seemed to be watching me (*Just my imagination,* I told myself). I stepped to Karen’s door and knocked, and when there was no response, opened it to soft snoring. Definitely asleep. There was no way she could have moved the doll and dashed to her room and into bed without me seeing. There had been no one in the living room. No one. Just the doll. I flicked on the Karen’s light switch, thoroughly spooked.\n\n“What’s going on?” Karen slurred, yawning and sitting up. She asked if I’d found Binky. I told her no. Then I told her what I’d seen.\n\nHer eyes grew wide—with fear? No. Of course not. With delight.\n\nThen she got out her phone to have me do a fucking interview. My co-star Boo Boy alongside me.\n\nFML.\n\nBut the walking… it was *real.* I swear to you it was real. This is why I moved my post from AITA to here. I need your help. Karen won’t give up playing this game with Boo Boy. And I… is it crazy that I sort of think this might be dangerous? What do I do? If I destroy the doll, WIBTA? Resolving ethical conundrums is supposed to be one of the few things my degree is useful for, but philosophy doesn’t really cover, you know… paranormal puppetry.\n\n[What do I do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",

        "text": " “He’s doing it because he likes you”\n\nThat’s what they always say, isn’t it? It’s what my mom said when I came home crying with sand in my eyes from being suddenly pushed down. It’s what the daycare worker said when I told her that he had chased me around, trying to put bugs into my hair. It’s what his dad said when I came to his house to get my DS back after he stole it. That’s the explanation given for Noah’s life mission to make me as miserable as possible. That’s such bullshit, isn’t it?\n\nI’d never done anything to him, in fact, I wanted to be his friend when he moved to the neighborhood. For some reason, he didn’t like me at all, but weirdly enough he sought me out. It wasn’t just a “girls have cooties” kid thing either, he kept it up. Through middle school and high school, he was a constant, headache-inducing presence in my life. By senior year, Noah was the most popular guy in the whole school. It made sense in theory, his family was rich, he was on the varsity track team and apparently, he threw the best parties. No one seemed to mind him terrorizing me every day, maybe it was because they knew they’d be next if they did mind. Not even the teachers did anything, their reason being that he and his friend had never actually hurt me. I wasn’t beat up every day, but they made me run their errands and forced me to go along as their designated driver when they went out into the woods to drink expensive booze stolen from Noah’s parents. I guess the staff treating it like it was no big deal made me think it’d be best to ride it out. No, he never hit me, but it felt like he’d scrapped out everything inside me, leaving an empty shell. Noah had been breaking me down since we were kids. \n\nI didn’t have friends because of that, no one wanted to risk being servant number two. I had people that I talked to in school, but my calendar was blank on weekends and vacations. I focused on studying, having set my sights on a college in another state. I’d gotten my acceptance letter; it was my ticket away from Noah and his friends. There was three days left until prom, three days until I’d finally be free. \n\nThe town library was one of the places where I could have peace. \n\n“Hey Anne, come to return everything?” Oliver asked as I approached the counter, carrying a stack of books. He worked at the library; he was my age but went to a school in the next town over. We got along well, we’d talk about books and school, it was fun, he made the library feel safe. I’ll admit, I liked him a little bit. \n\n“Yeah, I’ll be off to college soon, I’d rather not rake up a library debt”, I said, placing the books down. \n\n“Me too, college I mean, it’ll be weird not seeing each other, I’ll…miss you a lot”, Oliver said, averting his gaze like he was nervous. I felt my face heat up and not because of the broken air conditioner.\n\n“I’ll miss you too, two-person book club wouldn’t be the same without you”, I spoke. I wanted to slap myself for saying something so dumb. Oliver finally looked at me, fidgeting with his necklace. \n\n“I know there’s no music, flowers or signs but…I was wondering if you wanted to go to prom with me?” He said quietly. My heart pounded in my ears, like it was about to burst out of my chest and cartoonishly dance on the counter. I wanted to, I wasn’t even planning on going to prom, my brain was working overtime. I didn’t even have a dress! But my excitement dulled, the reason why I didn’t want to go was bearing his signature smile in my mind. Noah would probably drag me to countless sketchy parties, and if Oliver was with me, who knows what would happen to him? \n\nNoah never hurt me, but it wasn’t a coincidence that the guy who also want to be track captain broke his leg, I just knew it wasn’t. \n\nOliver spoke up, I’d probably been quiet for a while. “We’d go to your prom, of course, I wouldn’t want you to-“, I perked up, that was perfect. \n\n“I’d love to go! Can we go to your school’s prom? Punch-spiking is basically a tradition at mine, and it has *not* ended well”, I said, smiling in relief. Oliver smiled brightly back, I almost felt the need to put my sunglasses on. \n\n“Sure! I can’t wait, what color is your dress?” He asked, rubbing the back of his neck. I looked down at my blue t-shirt. \n\n“It’s blue…”, I answered, making a mental note to look for a blue dress. \n\n“I’ll get a matching tie, here’s my number by the way”, he said, scribbling down on a sticky note. I took the paper, placing it safely in my pocket. Oliver’s shift was over, we said our goodbyes as he left the library. I heard footsteps behind me, someone had been behind a bookshelf the whole time. \n\n“Blue? That’s not your color, I think green suits you better, do you really want to miss your prom for that nerd school?”, a familiar, headache-inducing voice spoke. I turned around to see Noah leaned against the bookshelf, he usually avoided the library like the plague. Normally, I wouldn’t say anything, I’d leave as soon as I could, not wanting to breathe the same air as him for a second more. \n\nBut the happiness bubbling inside me was overwriting everything else, I’d have the best night of my life in just three days and after that, I’d be miles away from Noah. I said what I felt, for the first time in years. \n\n“There’s nothing you can say to ruin this, in 72 hours, you won’t mean a thing to me, I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted, because we’re done here”, I spat, walking hastily out of the library. I expected him to follow me, to yell an insult back, but he was completely silent. \n\nI didn’t realize it at the time, but that the worst way he could have reacted. \n\nI never played any sports, but now I wanted to give the coach some farewell flowers for organizing one last practice. My mom had borrowed Noah’s mom’s blender and I had to return it. It would have been awkward to see Noah again after what I had said. I didn’t have a clue how Noah came from his mom; she was nicer than a care bear. Hence why I was persuaded to come inside for a glass of lemonade.  \n\n“You’ve grown up so pretty, Anne! I’ve always wanted a daughter, but having Noah convinced me that one was enough!” The woman laughed. I swirled my straw, listening to the ice clinking against the glass, I gave a strained smile. At least Noah was consistently annoying. “I guess you could only ever be my daughter-in-law-“she started, but I quickly cut her off by standing up. The rest of that sentence would probably make my ears bleed. \n\n“May I use your bathroom?” I quickly asked, the woman nodded and pointed upstairs. I hurried so much that I didn’t realize that she hadn’t specified which door it was. I tried my luck and opened one, it was Noah’s room, judging by the track medals. \n\nA normal person would just have closed the door, but I opened it wider. The guy had made my school life a lonely hell, I felt like I deserved to have a peek at his room. It was surprisingly clean and organized, like a room you’d see in a furniture ad. I was almost disappointed by the normalcy, but I found one thing that stood out. It was the yearbook, but there were a few colorful page markers sticking out. I picked up the book and flipped to the marked spots, I expected it to be of friends, but what I found make my stomach twist. The marked pages all had me on them. \n\nThere was my senior picture and club photo, but he had even marked pictures with me in the background. \n\nI went home, saying that my mom had called. \n\nOliver had ditched me; he had gone on a college tour that was supposed to only last a day and he hadn’t come home. All I did was check my phone, hoping he’d text me that he was on his way. He had stopped responding that morning, I was hoping for a miracle. The blue dress I loved so much when I bought it felt scratchy and suffocating. I was sitting in my room on prom night, like I had planned originally. \n\nA knock, there was a knock at the door. I zipped down the stairs and threw open the front door. I expected to see Oliver with his dimpled smile and blue tie. The sight that greeted me was straight out of one of my nightmares. Noah stood of my doorstep, wearing a tuxedo, and holding a corsage, his tie was blue, the exact same shade as my dress. His eyes on me felt like they were burning holes through my body. \n\n“You clean up nice, sorry it doesn’t really match”, he held out the corsage, expecting me to stick out my wrist. The large orange begonias on the band hurt my eyes, I looked behind him instead. His convertible stood parked outside, it was empty. \n\nThis wasn’t a prank to show off to his friends, Noah was seriously asking, or rather forcing, me to go to prom with him. \n\nI rubbed my temple, my head was pulsing, this combined with being stood up was too much. \n\n“I can’t believe it; you *actually* did all of that because you liked me? You need a better grasp on reality if you thought there was chance, I’d say yes, either I’m dreaming or this is a joke because I can’t imagine that anyone is stupid enough to think that”, I said. It was all crumbling down now, the feelings I’d bottled up in those years of being passive had boiled over. I slammed the door, or I tried to, but Noah kept it open with his grip. His cocky grin had melted away, revealing a cold expression. I felt shivers down my spine, something in him had snapped too. \n\n“I don’t understand, you don’t have anyone else, I spent years making sure that you didn’t”, he put a hand on his chin, like he was the confused one. “You have no friends no social life, I’m all you can depend on, so why won’t you like me back?” He hummed in thought. I took a step back from the door, something was off, Noah wasn’t making any sense. “Your mom’s not even here for her daughter’s prom! I’m the only one who ever thinks about you”, he spoke lowly, it felt like an earthquake when he took a step into the house. \n\n“Oliver did…”, I said, trying to prove him wrong by naming the guy who ditched me. \n\nI just wanted to prove him wrong and, unfortunately, I did that. \n\nNoah *laughed*, it was cold and joyless. \n\n“The library boy? The one who’s probably banging a college girl right now?” He kept laughing, now he sounded amused. He took a step forward, I walked backwards, looking around for something, anything to defend myself with. \n\n“How the hell do you know he’s at a college?” I asked, none of this made any sense, he couldn’t have known. Noah gave an exaggerated sigh and reached into the pocket of his tux. He pulled out a familiar item, Oliver’s necklace. He threw it on the floor in front of me, like it was offering. \n\n“Well, I guess we’re being honest, I was at the same tour, we all went swimming and it’d be pretty hard to think about someone when you’re at the bottom of a lake”, he stated, walking towards me. Noah was annoying, but I thought there was no way he’d ever *kill* *someone*. But as he walked over the necklace, I could see the look in his eyes clearly. There was no teasing edge, he wouldn’t suddenly reveal that he was messing with me and drive off.\n\nJust because he liked me, he killed someone.\n\nI felt around on the table next to me, picking up something cold, my body moved on its own, my brain was drowning in my headache. Noah yelled out when what I was holding was lodged into his thigh, I used this to run past him and out to his car, the keys were still in. Noah barged out of my house, a letter opener sticking out of his leg, his dress pants were damp with blood. I hopped in, turned the key, and floored the gas pedal. \n\nI’m not sure how far he chased me, not even a track captain can run far after being stabbed. \n\nI don’t know where to go from here, he left his wallet in his car and there’s enough cash to last me a few nights at a motel. I’ll run out soon though and no doubt he’s already reported the car stolen. I’m disgusted at everyone’s indifference, or even excitement, at how Noah treated me. He didn’t like me, that’s not why he did it. What he feels can’t be described like a teenage rosy crush, he is obsessed. \n\nWell, I doubt he still thinks fondly of me, I did stab him. But he deserved it, I’m not going to just be fine with this anymore. He’s going to find me and he’s going to be alone, and that will be his biggest mistake. \n\nI’m not stooping to his level; I’m bringing him back down there.\n\nI’m doing it because I *hate* him.",

        "text": "I had the bright idea to fish out my dad’s old radio from the attic. I somehow ended up intercepting a distress call. That was a week ago. Today, I tried to return home only to find the roads closed off.\n\nI wiped off years of dust and slowly lowered it down the creaking steps. Pulling it into my living room I couldn’t help but marvel at the vintage wooden casing along with its intricate brass detailing. I made sure everything was still in working order as I turned the knobs hearing them click as they went. The radio crackled to life encasing the room in a warm, fuzzy sound.\n\nI was ready to go, sifting through station after station. The usual came through at first, all sorts of music genres, ads, local news, and above all, the radio preachers. I kept at it for a few minutes remembering how my dad and I used to always do this on the weekends when he didn’t have work. I would be sitting right next to him listening in. It was our thing, every weekend without fail. I suppose the extra time I had today reminded me of it. It was almost comforting hearing the sound of static flooding my living room once I hit an empty channel.\n\nAt least I thought it was empty until a woman’s voice came through.\n\n*This is Dr. Emily Davis, lead scientist of the research team stationed at Emerald Bay. We are broadcasting this message to hopefully warn at least a few people. Our comm system has gone dark. The situation is dire. I believe we have started something we can’t stop.*\n\nIt paused momentarily, overtaken again by static. I was questioning if what I just heard was real or not. I know that sometimes there are storytelling programs but her voice was so full of emotion, of fear. Not to mention Emerald Bay was a small island about thirty miles off the coast from my home. Just barely inside the range of this radio. I sat up to change the channel but before a could grab the dial her voice broke through again.\n\n*Operation Starfall, it was a success. The Dimensional Displacement Engine worked as intended, but I believe our coordinates were off somehow. We have connected with some place that definitely isn’t the parallel Earth we came in contact with the first time. What we connected to this time seems to be a realm of complete darkness. There is another problem, upon breach into this other place, a shockwave swept throughout the facility which damaged our comms along with other electrical systems. Luckily the old broadcasting radio is still somewhat functional. If our contractors are listening we need assistance immediately. Something has tethered itself to the gate and is stopping the system from closing it. Our sensors have also been picking up additional movement beyond the gate for the last thirty minutes since it opened. We have been forced to recognize the idea that something may be trying to come through. With what we have available I fear we won’t be able to stop it.*\n\n*We have decided that igniting the remaining fuel which will hopefully take the machine out along with it. This has to be done manually, and as the lead scientist, I will be the one to stay back to accomplish this task. The others have already loaded onto the boat and are heading back to shore. I’ve gathered the proper equipment needed and will proceed with igniting the–.”*\n\nWhat cut her off was something I couldn’t even begin to describe. Some sort of low groan which even to me in my living room was deafening. Sweat was beading off my forehead, if this was indeed a radio show, it was one worthy of an oscar.\n\n*Something has breached the gate! I repeat, the gate has been breached! Some kind of dark writhing mass is pulling its way out into the station. I’m going to ignite the fuel now. I–I’ve opened the valve to dump the remaining fuel out into the room.*\n\nThat same noise interrupted her again, louder this time. The noise settled deep into my bones, a primal fear erupting inside me causing me to instinctively backpedal from the radio.\n\n*Jesus Christ! What the hell are you? If anyone's listening, please be prepared to evacuate the area. If our contractors can hear this, we need armed assistance, now! I don’t know if this will stop it! God help us.*\n\nHer voice was coming from off in the distance this time, but as the last sentence escaped her lips a loud boom reverberated out through the speakers followed by the radio returning back to its original fuzzy crackle. This time I wasn’t greeted same comforting sense as before. Instead, I was left sitting all alone in my living room shaking from what I had just heard. As if on cue two large helicopters flew over my house and off into the distance.\n\nI spent the next half hour trying to calm myself down. I don’t know what was worse, the anxiety that came from not knowing what happened, or the feeling of being a fool for letting some stupid radio show get me this worked up. I was praying it was the latter.\n\nMy afternoon was spent cleaning and doing odd jobs around my house. No matter how hard I scrubbed the dishes or how many windows I shined I couldn’t get her voice out of my head. What if it was real? What if she didn’t stop it and whatever crawled out of that abyss was making its way here right now? I knew I was just being paranoid, I had to be. The same thing happens when I spend too much time watching the news convincing myself Armageddon is upon us.\n\nI needed a drink. An old bottle of scotch I had shoved to the back of the cabinet sufficed. Sitting down with a hefty glass and some old cartoons outta do the trick. Childish I know. I flipped mindlessly through the channels trying to find something when the local weather appeared.\n\nI paused for a moment as I checked it. The headline was. *Freak Storm Forming Off \\[Redacted\\] Coast.* Then they showed the radar and I watched in horror as I realized where the storm came from. Smack right down in the center was a small green dot surrounded by blue.\n\nEmerald Bay.\n\nThat was a week ago. I left my house as soon as I saw it. Sure enough, as I loaded into my rickety pickup just barely visible over the horizon there it was. A cloud so black it seemed to absorb the light around it. I don’t think I’ve ever driven that fast in my life.\n\nToday I finally ran out of the emergency fund that was paying for my hotel room. I tried looking online to see if my home was safe to return to. The thing is, I couldn’t find a single article about my little coastal village. Like it had been wiped from existence. How do you get rid of an entire town's online presence in a week?\n\nI had to go see for myself. I know it probably wasn’t the greatest idea but it was either that, or plan out how I was going to survive in my truck with a broken heater. I drove the hour stretch of road to get back to my home. Before I could reach it however I came upon a roadblock.\n\nBlacked-out SUVs with no identifiable organization plastered on. Same with the people with rifles slung over their backs. I asked them if what was going on had anything to do with what I heard over the radio. They didn’t answer my question and told me a train car had derailed with dangerous chemicals onboard. Why does a chemical spill warrant soldiers with guns?\n\nI asked if I could at least get my things from my home but I was denied. I had no choice but to turn away. As I was leaving I peered back through my mirror to see the soldiers pile into two of the three SUVs and tear out in the opposite direction. I got back to my hotel and launched myself onto my bed, defeated.\n\nAt least I don’t think I’ll have to worry about paying for another night at this hotel because just a few minutes ago I heard that same low thunderous groan I heard over the [radio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoullessHQ/)",

        "text": "My home office is blooming with… something dark. As I wait for dawn, I thought I’d write this experience down. I can’t (and wouldn't dare to) sleep, and I really need a distraction right now. I can hear things scratching in the room, voices as well, low and whispered. That wasn’t the plan, but I’ll heed the instructions and wait for dawn. So -- here goes, from the top.\n\nJosie, my wife, decided that we need to separate. This came as no surprise, but it hurt as much either way. If you’d ask why, I’d counter with how much time you’ve got. Our estrangement has been a long and cold process, with fault residing on both parties. We’d been together for twelve years, married for eight, living together for seven. And yes, this does mean we were married for a year before we lived together - at the time our love was stronger than our wallets were fat. Technically we did live together at the time, though, only it was alongside my parents, at their house, in their basement - not exactly *living* together as much as sharing an awkard space where my parents might walk in any second. Although she broke the news of the separation *solo*, the pragmatics we’ve dealt with as a couple; I’ll move out, she’ll stay at the apartment. \n\nWe’re not actively hostile towards each other, so there’s been no real need to hurry. It took me about a month to find a place - with her help - but I still have a few weeks until I can move in. It has been… bittersweet. Working together to find a new apartment, sorting through our belongings - we’ve really worked *together* for the first time in a long time, and that has felt… nice. The apartment has felt warm again, the way it used to years ago, when our relationship was more passionate than bureaucratic. Anyway, I’ve been slowly packing up my stuff so there would be a bit less stress on moving day (who am I kidding, it’s still gonna suck more than anything), and as I was picking out my books (few and far between) between her books (plentiful and varied) on our large, shared Billy-shelf, I came across one I hadn’t seen in a long time.\n\nThe book in question was my grandmother’s old grimoire. She died when I was eleven or twelve, so I never got to know her well. I snagged the book for myself as I was helping my parents sort through her stuff after her death. She owned hundreds of books, and I don’t think my parents gave more than a vacant nod when I asked them if I could have it - if they had, I doubt they’d have let their christian son own a bona fide witches grimoire. \n\nI’d only ever flipped through it once or twice, mostly letting it decorate any bookshelf I’d had during my life. It was in my room as a kid, standing between Percy Jackon novels on a small, never dusted, one foot long shelf above my bed. Later, it took center stage on my first *actual* bookshelf that I bought for my first apartment. It was optimistic of me to give such square footage for a bookshelf; it never got to hold more than thirty books at best, mostly becoming an open liquor cabinet (liquor shelf?). And finally, it had decorated me and Josie’s bookshelf - this one actually quite full - for years. Now it was time to find a new shelf for it to stand on once again.\n\nI sat down with the book, determined to finally give it the attention it had been deprived of all these years. I felt rude towards my grandma for just lugging it around all my life, never reading it, but then I thought about what my parents would’ve done to the book if I hadn’t rescued it. At best they would’ve donated it somewhere, at worst burned it and scattered the ashes in some seedy alleyway where God’s eyes never landed.\n\nSo now, my fellow NoSleepers, we’ve come to the bit that might actually interest someone other than my therapist. The grimoire held within its pages a slew of instructions: recipes for herby concoctions to cure sleeplessness, the right way to prepare certain ingredients (mushrooms, plants, bones, and other miscellaneous things one might find on the floor of a forest), how to read rocks to see the future, and finally a bunch of rituals for luck, prosperity, and other vaguely ‘good’ things. Within these rituals there was one that caught my eye: The Two Sisters.\n\nThe section about The Two Sisters ritual has multiple pages of prologue, which I’ll try to condense down to its main points below.\n\nBasically, throughout my grandma’s lineage, The Two Sisters have been summoned to help resolve conflict within two members of the family. In essence, when you’re in bad relations (not talking to each other, separated and what have you) they’d communicate to the other person what your true feelings are. The book describes this as ‘*the summoning of true love, delivered upon the loved ones heart and soul in language understood within*.’ The ritual was born of necessity, and it is to be used only as such. The sisters themselves are young and wear pale blue clothing. One of them is called Voice, the other Face. Voice apparently has no face but can speak, and Face - you guessed it - has no voice, instead boasting a long and distorted grimace for a face. If the ritual is performed accordingly and to completion, the sisters will convey the ritual maker's feelings to the subject, and hopefully the two can then resolve their issues.\n\nAfter the prologue, there are warnings. \n\n*‘Do not perform upon non-family members.’*\n\n*‘Do not perform with impure thoughts.’*\n\n*‘Do not attempt to invoke either Sister by their lonesome.’*\n\nFollowing this, there are the step-by-step instructions for the ritual. It’s quite detailed, so bear with me.\n\n\\-\n\n**The Two Sisters**\n\nFind yourself in a room after dusk, the doors closed, the windows shut, and the curtains drawn. Following you, no one else may enter the room until you have left.\n\nLight two candles in front of you, two feet from each other, one on your left and one on your right. **You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**\n\nBetween the candles, place a bowl filled halfway with water. The bowl should be large enough to show the reflection of your face.\n\nAfter the room is ready, sit with your legs crossed two feet away from the bowl in front of you. **You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**\n\nRest your hands on your knees, the fingers facing upwards, and close your eyes.\n\n**You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**\n\nKeep your eyes shut until the flames of the candles burn your hands. Do not open your eyes until the flame touches you; not for movement, sound, warmth or cold. Whatever may speak to you or touch you, you must ignore until the next phase.\n\nOnce the flames burn your hands, open your eyes and stare directly into the water.\n\nIf either candle is unlit or has moved from their place, **end the ritual.**\n\nIf the water bowl has been toppled over, spilled, or moved, **end the ritual.**\n\nIf you can no longer discern the walls of the room, **end the ritual.**\n\nUpon continuing, stare into the bowl of water in front of you. The candles should give enough light for the water to produce reflections.\n\n**You are the third flame, completing the ▽**\n\n**△ ǝɥʇ ƃuᴉʇǝldɯoɔ 'ǝɯɐlɟ pɹᴉɥʇ ǝɥʇ ǝɹɐ no⅄**\n\nThe Two Sisters shall approach you through the water’s reflection. Once you see them, do not avert your gaze. In the reflection, you will seem them float above.\n\n**as Above △, so Below ▽** \n\n**▽ ʍolǝq os '△ ǝʌoq∀ sɐ**\n\nOnly look at and talk to the sisters through the reflections in the water.\n\nTell Face who you want to speak to and why.\n\nTell Voice what you want to say in your heart. Think of the loved one in your most pure desire.\n\nOnce you have spoken to both sisters, blow out the candles and allow them to leave the room first.\n\nAfter a short while, exit the room with the water bowl, and empty the bowl onto the earth. Do not re-enter the room until dawn.\n\nThe Two Sisters will visit your loved one the following night, and the rest is up to you.\n\n**If you need to stop the ritual at any point, walk out of the room and wait until dawn to re-enter.**\n\n**Do not stay with the Two Sisters for longer than the candles burn.**\n\n\\-\n\nSo -- that’s the ritual. I’m not going to bore you with any major postulations. I was raised a christian, but as an adult, I’ve been what I’d call so-and-so, basically *I dunno* \\- but I *do* have an upbringing induced allergy/fascination to all things spooky. I put the book in a cardboard box with all seven other books I seemed to own (I should read mode), but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. \n\nThis brings us to tonight. Josie was going out with her friends, and said that she’ll be staying the night with one of them, as they’ll be going to brunch together the next morning. Although we’re mostly fine with living together even as we’re separated, she still takes any chance she can to not share a bed with me. Can’t blame her for that. I was slightly let down that she wouldn’t be around, since I didn’t have any plans of my own. I know it sounds sad, but I’d rather be with my estranged wife than be alone right now. I texted a couple of friends to see if they’d be up for something. No luck. Feeling defeated, I remembered the grimoire - *maybe I could arrange a hangout with the two sisters instead*, I thought.\n\nNow, I know, you might think that I’m a huge idiot for doing this - and as I’m writing this, waiting for dawn, I’d agree with you. Eight hours ago, though, I thought myself an opportunist. Much like what writing is doing for me right now, the ritual was meant to just give me *something* to do - something that garners all focus and lets my mind escape this greige reality for a moment or two. So call me an idiot, if you will, but remember that I was a *sad* idiot.\n\nI picked up the book and started gathering supplies. First, I went to the kitchen and grabbed myself a large metal mixing bowl. The bowl had no attributes of ambiance - unlike a nice wooden salad bowl might’ve had - but it at least could fit my face in it, which I cleverly tested by holding the bowl up to my face. “That’ll do,” I said, my voice echoing uncomfortably loud in the steel half-globe.\n\nNext, I rummaged through drawers and cabinets until I found two long, white candles, which seemed the most fitting for the occasion. More fitting than wood and vanilla scented, girthy ones that burned for approximately 70 hours, anyway. Josie had gotten us some golden candle holders that we kept on our coffee table (but never actually burned any candles in, hence my difficulty in finding the candles), which worked perfectly, so I grabbed two out of the set of three along with a box of matches.\n\nDeciding on the room was easy. Our apartment isn’t huge, and the only rooms with doors are our shower/bathroom, the bedroom, and a small room we use as a home office. I wasn’t gonna sit on the toilet, obviously, and our king-sized bed took up most of the space in the bedroom. That left me with the office, which I cleared out a bit, making enough room to sit and place the required objects on the floor. I closed the blinds from the single window and unplugged the power strip, so no chargers or laptops would have their LED lights blaring. I brought in the supplies and laid out the candles as well as the bowl, testing out the sitting arrangement as I did so. \n\nAfter a few deep breaths, I went through the instructions once more, checking off items and requisites:\n\n* Dark room after dusk ✔\n* Two candles two feet apart from each other ✔\n* Big bowl filled halfway with water between the candles ✔\n* Space to sit comfortably without bumping my knees or elbows on random clutter ✔\n* No disturbances as estranged wife is having fun with her friends while I’m left alone to wallow in sadness and try weird old rituals ✔\n\nI was ready.\n\nStarting off, I squeezed myself into some comfy clothes and turned my phone off and left it outside the room. I checked that everything was ready, even peered out our kitchen window a bit  just to check if, for whatever reason, night had betrayed me and the morning had come soon. With the dark room brooding, the apartment still and silent, I have to admit - I got a bit spooked. But after going through all this effort, it’d be a shame *not* to do this. So, in I went into our drab and dark home office turned ritual sanctum. I lit the two candles, closed the door and took my assigned seat.\n\nSitting cross-legged wasn’t in my repertoire, as my legs quickly started to fall asleep, or some weird muscle I'd not erealized even existed intil that very moment would start twitching. I’d never been much for yoga, or any type of exercise for that matter. After a while, though, I got into a semi-comfortable spot and decided to begin. I rested my hands on my knees, the fingers pointing up at God, and closed my eyes.\n\nFor the first five minutes, absolutely nothing happened. Complete silence enveloped me, and it was sort of calming to just sit and meditate. *This isn’t so bad,* I thought. *Maybe after this I can have a nice cup of chamomile tea and call it a night. Did we still have that tea? I forgot to check. I hope so. If not, I’ll find some other non-caffeinated tea to drink --*\n\nI heard a slight *woosh* as the candle flames moved. I thought a draft had gotten in, or maybe it was the ventilation, or maybe I just breathed too hard. Then it came again. This time I *felt* it on my skin, like someone had dragged an ice cold towel across my arm. My bones tried to jump through my skin, making me almost fall over on my back. I reminded myself of the instructions and decided to hold my eyes shut as I took a few deep breaths to calm myself down. This proved difficult, since I had an almost irresistible urge to check what (if anything) had touched me. Have you ever walked down the street and closed your eyes momentarily, just to see what it was like to be blind? How each step would bring further discomfort and an aching need to *justquicklycheck* what was in front of you? Well, that’s how I felt, except I wasn’t walking, and there should be nothing else in the room.\n\nThen I heard a voice. A tiny, tiny whisper that came from behind me in the southwest corner of the room. It sounded far away, like the room was much bigger than it should be. I’m pretty sure I even heard it echo. I couldn’t discern what the voice was saying. After a minute or two it stopped, and the room felt like it returned to its original dimensions, the walls silently cascading back to their original positions.\n\nTime and space had become more and more difficult to discern. After a while - could’ve been anything between thirty seconds and ten minutes - I felt a warmth before me, like someone had brought an oven into the room and turned it up to 200°C (that’s 392 Fahrenheit for you yanks). Then, just like that, the warmth was gone, the room becoming cold as death in an instant. A shiver shot through me. Almost immediately after this, both of my hands *burned*, like someone had dropped hot oil in the middle of my palms. The pain was so intense the reaction made me open my eyes. \n\nThroughout the ritual, my head was facing forward, so as you can imagine, when I opened my eyes, I looked straight at the door - though the instructions said to look at the bowl of water. I realized this, panicked, and shifted my gaze immediately to the water. I guess it was too late, because as I did this, I saw the candles go out in unison. The room became pitch-black, and from above my head I heard a loud scream.\n\nI jumped up, almost falling over myself as my legs were numb from sitting, and lunged at the door. The screaming continued, not in any way changing pitch or slowing down or lowering volume.\n\nAs I stumbled towards the door, I heard crashing, thumping and scratching behind me, like something was lurching forward through the wall itself. I opened the door, jumped out of the room and closed it behind me. The second I closed the door, the screaming stopped, and the thing that lurched no longer made a sound, like it had decided to not follow me past this point. \n\nI sat on the floor and stared back at the door, trying to gather my thoughts, which mostly consisted of variations of *What the FUCK?.* My pondering was brought to its demise as I started to hear scratching coming from inside the room. I started to crawl away from the room while still keeping my eye on it.\n\nThen the voice I’d heard earlier started to whisper in the room. Its pitch went up and down like a wave, some syllables deep growls, some consonants like pinpricks. The voice moved as well, left and right, forward and back, *above and below.*\n\nSoon after I heard stomps that sounded like someone was walking around the room.\n\nThe deathly darkness was interrupted as a small light flickered to life and glowed under the door.\n\nI got back to the instructions and re-read them. Two things were obvious: **a)** I’d fucked up by looking up instead of at the water, and **b)** I should NOT open that door until dawn. I made my way to the kitchen and opted for coffee instead of the chamomile I’d been meditating on.\n\nThat brings us to now. I’m sitting in the living room writing this on my laptop, giving quick glances to the room. I can’t let it out of my sight, as I’m afraid it will open itself for some reason, even though the instructions did not warn of any such occurrence. The scratching and stomping and voices are still all there, moving and twisting behind the door. I checked the exact time for when the sun comes up, and right now it’s still 3 hours and 37 minutes until dawn. That’s three and a half hours of me sitting here babysitting this spooky fucking room. I’m running out of things to write, so I’ll try to watch something on TV to try and get any sort of mind numbing buzz to distract me from the room.\n\nI think I just heard a knock on the door.",

        "text": "I live in a condo. Very comfy and cozy but there has always been a eerie vibe to the place. In my time living here my family has experienced a few odd events but nothing major. A few spoons and plates would go missing. Maybe some clothes. We have even heard what sounds like foot steps in places we know somebody else isn’t. Happens to everyone. The house is old and settling has always been the explanation. But recently, more noticeable things have been happening. \n\nWe have a green stool in our living room that we use to set cups and plates on when we are eating in the living room. It’s been in about the same spot for years. And a week ago, It disappeared. Without a trace. And while this is strange it’s still not hard evidence that anything is wrong. But a certain situation has stuck with me. When quarantine went on, I feel like most people had a DIY stage. My mom sure did. So we have a bunch of paint, and tools and wood in our basement from when she would make random things to keep her busy. One day, my family walked into the house after a busy day and everything seemed normal. I looked down at the stairs to my basement and realized something. Their was paint footprints going up the stairs from the basement. But not shoe prints. bare feet, you could make out the toes. \n\nSo I mentioned it to my mom. Hoping she would have a reasonable explanation as to why they were there. But like I assumed. She had no idea where they came from and was just about as confused as I was. But after a little bit of confusion and shock we just brushed it off and she ended up wiping the paint off the stairs. Yesterday, I saw him. My mother had been at work and I was coming home from school. I knew nobody would be home so when I came into the house I didn’t announce my presence. As I took off my shoes and backpack I heard a noise unlike any I’ve ever heard. I froze to listen. there’s always random noises happening while I’m hanging out that I just ignore, as I have loud neighbors. But as I approached the couch, the sound happened again. This time I could clearly hear it. It came from my room, which is Directly above the living room. I paused the tv. It went silent. Way to silent. \n\nAs I’m laying on the couch listening for another sound, even a squeak. I get a text. From my mom. She is working late and won’t be home till later that night. I put down my phone and unpaused my show. It’s about 7pm and my stomach is killing me. I get up and sluggishly walk to the kitchen, Opening the fridge to see it’s completely empty. Except for a microwaveable chicken and rice. My stomach was eating itself so I settled and just decided I was gunna deal with it and eat the chicken. I put the chicken in the microwave and start it. I plop back down onto the couch, hoping to pass the time so I can just eat. While I sit through a bogus flashlight commercial, I take a glance out the window. thick snowflakes fall quickly and fill the yard. While the snow is fascinating and all. The microwave goes off. I get off the couch and go to get my food. I reach to the microwave and just as my flesh touches the handle of the microwave. The power goes out. \n\nLuckily my phone still has enough battery to use the flashlight so I click it on. With everything in the house off It’s eerily silent. I grab my food and decide to finally go into my room and relax. As I take my first step up the stairs. I hear a pounding. louder than anything I’ve ever heard. As if it was inside my head. I turn on the lights over the stairs and start going up the stairs. As I get closer to my room. The pounding is getting louder, faster. I step to my door. Not knowing what will be behind the door, I swing it open. As I step into my room. The pounding stops. I feel the temperature drop. It felt like a meat locker. As I approach my bed I can hear something. From behind me, breathing heavily. I froze. My phone flashlight now flickering.\n\n I stood frozen for almost a minute, after about 30 seconds I finally muster the courage. I turn around. It becomes pitch black in my room and I now hear muffled whispering. I can’t make out what they are saying. Suddenly, after what felt like forever. Everything stops. it gets impossibly quiet. somehow through all the darkness. I could make out a figure, it was a tall. Faceless man. He leans down and whispers in my ear. “Should’ve ordered the flashlight”.",

        "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I'm not mad. I don't think I'm seeing things. I mean, I know I'm not. Something's happening to me. My friend Pamela, who lives a few doors down from me, said I should try to take a photo or a video of what's been going on. I tried that... Nothing showed up. Just me talking to thin air.\n\nBut there's a reason I know it's not all in my head. The other night the man appeared and... I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt started about three months ago. I was up late watching TV at night and I saw something out of my window. It was a bright light; like someone was shining a torch through the glass. My house is at the end of our street and looks out onto an old piece of waste ground where some of the local teens hang about and drink. I just thought it was one of them messing about with a torch. \n\nI looked out the window and couldn't see anything, it was too dark, so I went to my door and shouted for them to bugger off. I never thought anything of it. I... I went back into the living room and the TV was on a channel I hadn't been watching and the place was a mess. I always keep my newspapers and magazines under the coffee table - I'm too lazy to take them out to the bin - but pages had been torn out from them and they were scattered all over the place.\n\nThis happened in the space of what must have been twenty seconds. I was frightened and thought someone was in my house, so I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and looked around, but there was no one else there.\n\nI made sure the house was locked up, and checked the doors and the windows, but I didn't sleep well that night. I kept thinking about an old poltergeist case from England that was famous during the 1970s. Objects moving around by themselves, that sort of thing. But strangely, it was the light I’d seen outside that my mind couldn't stop fixating on more than anything else.\n\nAfter a couple of days, I managed to put the whole thing out of my head. At least, Until I was making dinner in the kitchen one night and I heard something tapping on the glass window next to me; a window that faces the patch of waste ground.\n\nMy kitchen is on the ground floor and I had the blinds down, so I couldn’t see exactly what it was, but there was another bright light coming from outside. Bright enough to shine through the material of the blinds.\n\n I stood rooted to the spot. I can’t quite explain it, but the sight of the light made me feel almost sick with fear. Sure, I should have felt a little apprehension seeing it again, but this was more than that. I could barely catch a breath.  Then it was dark again. The light was gone and the fear dissipated. \n\nI hoped I'd catch a glimpse of who had been shining the torch through the window as they ran off into the night. I pulled the blind open and felt ill again. Someone was standing outside about an inch away from the glass. I could see the window fogging up from their breath. A chill went through me, and I couldn't understand the way the figure was standing. \n\nIt was a man. But I couldn't see much of his features. He had his right arm draped over his eyes so I couldn't see what he looked like from the nose up. But it didn't make sense. Surely he couldn't have seen me either with his eyes covered over? He was just standing there. Not moving. Not doing anything. Just standing in that awkward pose with his arm over both eyes. \n\nA cold sweat came over me, like the way you feel before you’re going to throw up, and I remember thinking, not convincingly, that this was all some sort of weird joke designed to unnerve ‘the guy who lives alone at the end of the street’. \n\nI thumped the glass with my hand and told the man to get out of my garden. But he didn't move. He didn't respond. Again, the thought of it being a prank from some of the local kids came to me, but as I took in more of his features, that didn't make sense. The guy wasn't a teenager. I could see that much. He was in his thirties at least, maybe older. Although it was too dark to make out much else. \n\nWhen he didn't move, I started to think I was dealing with a real psycho, so I shouted through the glass that I was calling the police. \n\nI swear. I turned to grab my phone, which was on the worktop behind me, and when I looked up, the man had vanished. All I could see was the dim outline of the waste ground beyond the boundary of my property, lit partially by a couple of well-spaced out streetlamps. \n\nThere was no way I was going to let this slide. I was almost angry at how frightened I had felt. How dare anyone make me feel that way, you know? \n\nI called the police and they said they'd send someone around to check out the garden. But when they turned up, there was no one around. They said to phone if the man came back, and that was that. I didn't exactly feel safe. I tried to sleep that night, but when I lay in bed the image of the man at the window, covering his eyes with one hand, stuck with me. \n\nWhen I was a boy, my mum would sometimes make me a cup of chamomile tea if I couldn't sleep, and it was always enough to make me tired. So, I got out of bed with the same idea in mind, this must have been about 2 in the morning, and started to make my way to the kitchen. To move from my bedroom to the kitchen, I have to cross a hallway, and when I did, I felt something for a moment. It's something I'd only ever heard about but hadn't experienced myself. The hairs stood up on the back of my neck.\n\nI instinctively knew where to look: Down the hallway to the front door of my house. I watched, paralysed by fear as I saw the door handle move. It was as though someone was subtly testing the door to see if it was unlocked. Thankfully, it wasn't. But the handle still moved.\n\nI didn't know what to do, so I shouted out. Something garbled probably about getting away from the door. In response, the door handle stopped moving. On the top panel of the door, there’s a round piece of glass about a foot in diameter. It's slightly misted and more for decorative purposes than security. Especially at night, it’s almost impossible to see anything through it. That was the case until that same bright white light from the other nights throbbed on and off for a moment beyond it. \n\nThe light cast itself upward and I saw, for only a second, the same face as before. And in the same pose: A man, covering his eyes with one hand. This time, his mouth was open. The light pulsed on and off several times, very slowly, and it appeared that the face through the glass was talking. I could see the jaw moving.\n\nI shouted again that I would phone the police if he didn't leave. But that was when I started to hear something. Very low and hushed. But I could just about make out the man's voice. Instinctively, I stepped towards the door so that I could hear better, and that was when a loud screeching noise bellowed from... Somewhere. It felt like the ground and my insides shook together. I didn't need to check after that. The hairs on the back of my neck had returned to their usual relaxed state. The man was gone, light, voice, screeching sound and all.\n\nI phoned the police, but when they came to my house they found nothing. I think they were starting to think I was making things up.\n\nThen, I spoke with a neighbour of mine the next day, a woman who lived back along the street, and she told me that she'd had some issues with someone prowling around the outside of her house a couple of years previously. When she installed a security camera, the problem went away. She said maybe I should try that, at least if the guy came back, I'd have something concrete to show the police.\n\nSo, that was when I became determined to capture some footage of the man, for my own sanity’s sake and so the authorities could identify him.\n\nThe following night, I waited up until nearly 4 AM, but there was no sign of anything. So I eventually, exhausted, went back to bed, that was... Until I heard something at my bedroom window. I got up out of bed, grabbed my video camera, and looked out through the glass, but there was nothing and no one there. All I could see was the large piece of waste ground out beyond my garden.\n\nBut I could definitely hear something. It was muffled, but I was sure it was the man's voice again. But how could that be? I couldn't see him. I moved my head to about an inch from the glass, and just as I made out the sound of the words ‘the light won't stop shining’, a hand slammed against the glass. I jumped back. The hand was pressed up on the window, but it was like it had come out of the air from nothing. It was pale but covered in what looked like soil.\n\nI then heard the voice shout those same words again: 'the light won't stop shining', and then the hand pulled back. When it did, I suddenly saw the shape of a figure move off out of my garden. I zoomed in as best I could with the camera, but when I looked through the viewfinder, I could see nothing. Then, when I looked with my own eyes through the window, there it was. The figure of the man, walking off into the waste ground. \n\nI looked again at the viewfinder, but again it was showing me no sign of the man, and by the time I looked back through the glass again, the man had vanished. I guess that was when I started to suspect that I wasn't dealing with a normal prowler. I now entertained the idea that the man wasn't alive.\n\nNo amount of chamomile tea was going to let me sleep after that. Instead, I spent the rest of the night watching and re-watching the video footage I had taken. Not only had it captured nothing of interest visually, but even the voice I had heard speaking those unforgettable words, 'the light won't stop shining', hadn't been recorded. I had no idea how any of it was possible, but I had to find some answers or I was certain I was going mad.\n\nA few hours of delving into websites about hauntings, and things of that ilk, brought me to a forum called 'Things Unseen'. It was a place for people to share their paranormal adventures. Most of it was nonsense, I was sure. People playing at Ghostbusters, running around in abandoned places with video cameras and voice recorders, scaring each other and making up events to ensure that the endeavour was never pointless.\n\nBut, I didn't know where else to go. There was a section of the forum specifically dedicated to 'experts', and I say that with inverted commas, 'experts' giving their advice to people interested in investigating the paranormal. \n\nI wasn't so much interested in investigating it, but I did want to find out if anyone knew how to get the man who was visiting me at night away from my house so I could sleep.\n\nI posted about my experience, writing on their forums about how nothing was showing up on camera and mentioned every detail I could think of about the light, about what the man had repeated, about him covering his eyes with his arm and the fact that he wandered out towards the waste ground. Then, I finally passed out once the sun came up.\n\nA few hours later, I got up, had a shower and went for a walk in the sunshine to clear my head. In the sun, the area next to my house, that piece of waste ground, seemed harmless. But even as I walked, I couldn't erase the memory of the man wandering off towards it and vanishing. \n\nWhen I returned home, I checked my computer and saw that a few people had answered the post I'd made on the forum. Most of it I couldn't get on board with; 'burn sage in your home'; 'get an exorcist'; 'move out' one person even posted. That last one was the most reasonable in some ways, and if I was going to be visited by that man and that light every night, well, I'd have no choice but to leave. But where would I go? I had very little money. If I was going to be made homeless from these visits, I had to at least try something that might solve the problem.\n\nThat was when, amongst all the talk of 'crystals' and other hokum I filed under pure fantasy, I saw a post that caught my eye. It was very grounded. The woman who had made the post wished to remain anonymous. She was a long-time lurker on the forum of 'things unseen', but had to make an account just to answer my post.\n\nShe said that she'd had a similar experience. That something had visited her home at night from outside. In her case, she had lived in a small town in America, with her home looking out to a patch of woodland. At night, a small girl would wander out of the woods and walk around the outside of the woman's home looking sad and crying. \n\nIt became clear that the girl was dead, as sometimes she would appear as a rotting corpse in a white dress and move back between the trees. The woman tried everything to escape the horror of this every night, but the only thing that worked was to try and discover what the girl wanted.\n\nOne night, the woman followed the girl back into the woods with a friend, and then found her standing next to a large redwood tree. The woman claimed that she'd actually spoken with the girl there and then. She said she was lost, and that the tree was the only thing familiar to her because she used to play next to it with her younger brother. \n\nWhen the woman explained to the girl that she was dead, she sobbed into her white dress. The woman then asked the girl what year she thought it was and the girl said 1926. So, the woman told the girl that her parents were waiting on the other side for her and that she should be with them, that she could simply make the choice to be with them if she wanted to. The girl started to fade away as she told her this, like that was all she needed to know. Apparently, the girl turned and smiled at two shadowy figures that came out of the trees at that moment. She ran up to them and they embraced, and then suddenly, they were gone.\n\nThe woman wrote that she never saw the girl again. \n\nIt was her belief then that the man I was seeing was trapped by his lack of knowledge. He was wandering every night and didn't know he was dead. All I had to do was tell him he was dead and then he would pass on to the other side. She even speculated that the light I was seeing, the light that the man said wouldn't stop shining, was the light from the other side trying to help him. When I saw him shielding his eyes from the light, that was symbolic of his refusal to accept that he had to move on to whatever there is in the afterlife.\n\nThere was something about the woman's words. Just a few nights before, I would have laughed at them. But there was sincerity in the way they were written. She believed them. And if all I had to do was tell the man that he was dead and had to move on, then it was worth a shot. Not that I was keen to face him, but I just wanted to sleep, and the idea of abandoning my home because of those visitations was not one I wanted to entertain.\n\nI wish I had asked a friend to come with me, but something stopped me. I think I was embarrassed. People would have thought I'd gone mad. 'Oh, hey, would you mind coming over tonight while I tell a dead man he needs to go to heaven?' Yeah, that didn't seem crazy at all.\n\nAnd so, I was going to face it all alone.\n\nI tried to get some more sleep during the day so that I was fresh-faced for the night, but I couldn't fall over. \n\nWhen darkness finally came, I grabbed a torch and a knife of all things, opened the door to the cool night air, and then sat in a garden chair outside my front door and waited. I waited, and I waited. By about 2 AM, nothing had happened, and I was starting to feel sleepy. I remember looking at my watch, I think it was just before 3 AM when I realised I'd closed my eyes. I must have nodded off for a few minutes, and when I opened my eyes, I looked out towards the waste ground and saw someone standing underneath one of the street lamps.\n\nAt first, I thought it was someone who was very much alive, but then it happened. A bright light momentarily flared up around the figure. I couldn't bare staring at it, it was so bright. I covered my eyes, and when the light had faded away, I looked across again and saw that the figure beneath the streetlamp was still covering his eyes with his arm. He was kind of moving around slightly, almost circling the spot of ground, anxiously.\n\nIt was the man. I knew it. \n\nI had never been so nervous. But this had to end. Torch in hand, I walked out of my garden and started to walk across to where the man was standing. I'm telling you, every step I took made my blood freeze. As I got closer, I could hear the man mumbling over and over 'the light, the light, the light won't stop shining'.\n\nWhen I was just a few feet away from him, he stopped moving around as if he heard me, but his arm was still across his eyes.\n\n'Who's there?' he said in a frightened voice.\n\nWhat do you say to a ghost? I guess I just spoke to him as a person.\n\n'I live in the house you've been visiting,' I said, or something like that.\n\n'The light won't stop,' he said. I remember his mouth trembling.\n\n'It's a good light,' I said. 'I'm sorry, but you're dead. And you need to go into that light to be happy again.'\n\n'Dead?' He sounded surprised.\n\nI took a step closer.\n\n'It's okay, you'll be safe there.'\n\nAnd that was when he dropped his arm from his eyes. I've never seen anything like what I saw then. The man's face was horribly burned from the nose up. I could see the white of his skull through patches where the skin was either gone or painfully thin. And then there were his eyes. All I can say is that they were sealed. The skin had fused over where his eyes should have been, like melted wax. The man must have been blind.\n\n'The light...' he said once again.\n\nI was confused. How could he even see the light with his face like that? I cleared my throat and said again. 'The light is heaven. Go to it.'\n\nThen, he was gone. I don't know if it happened when I blinked or if he just vanished to the other side in front of me.\n\nThe waste ground felt empty. I was shaking. All I wanted was to get back to my house and hope that I'd never have to deal with anything so unreal or terrifying ever again in my life.\n\nTurning, I took a step back towards my garden, but my left foot was stuck on something in the ground. A crushing pain wrapped around my ankle, and I instinctively shone my torch down at my foot to see what had happened. I hadn't caught my foot in anything, but something had caught me. \n\nA rotten, burned hand was sticking up out of the waste ground, and it had grabbed me by the foot. I let out a scream for help, but my voice just echoed around the emptiness of the place. I suddenly realised just how alone I was, and how stupid I had been.\n\nThe hand squeezed around my ankle, and then another hand reached up out of the ground and grabbed hold of my knee. It yanked me down and I lost my footing. Before I knew what was happening, my body was in a prone position and my face was full of dirt from the ground. Two arms wrapped around my body. They yanked and pulled at me. It was as if they were trying to pull me into the ground itself.\n\nThen, a face pushed up out of the ground, and I screamed again as it pressed against mine. The eyes were fused shut, and the rotten mouth opened and closed like a shark, the teeth clattering inside. I nearly lost my mind there and then, but I remembered the knife I had brought. I pulled it out of my pocket and brought it up over the burned face. Repeatedly, I stabbed, down and down with each strike. But it did no good. The knife passed through the face like the thing was only half solid. Half of this world and half of somewhere else.\n\nThe hands continued to pull at me, and the face rubbed against mine, the closing and opening of the mouth, clicking over and over, again and again. It was desperately trying to pull me down into the ground, but I wouldn’t give up. Its efforts were in vain. I think it realised that eventually.\n\nA blinding white light shone momentarily around us. I covered my eyes from it, and, with a groan and scream of its own, the figure tried to cover its eyes, letting go of me. I was able to break free from its other arm and then stagger to my feet.\n\nI didn't run to my house. I didn't run to any house on that street. I just kept running and running until the madness of fear left me and I slumped down onto a park bench a couple of miles from my home.\n\nAfter a thing like that, you don't go back. Some friends and family, who all thought I'd had a breakdown, volunteered to go to the house and get some of my things. They wouldn't listen to me. I was prescribed some anti-anxiety meds by a doctor and even she wouldn't entertain the finger marks I showed her on my ankle.\n\n'Maybe you were attacked, but the rest was a hallucination,' she said.\n\nYeah, right. \n\nA friend gave me a spare room in his place for me to stay until I sold my house. I felt bad selling it to anyone. I just made sure it wasn't sold to someone with kids or anyone elderly or living alone. I told the real estate agent: It has to be a couple in their prime. At least they’d have each other if that thing turned up.\n\nI haven't heard anything since that night. I wrote to the couple who now live in the house and asked if anything strange had happened since I’d left, any lights being shone through their windows by local kids. But they've never seen anything. Maybe it's because they're not alone.\n\nOf course, I couldn't let what I’d seen go, not entirely. I needed some sort of explanation. So here it is: I spoke with a historian from a local college. I wanted to know about that spot of waste ground. What she told me left me stunned. \n\nA factory had been there at one time, sixty years before I moved to that house. The factory processed magnesium oxide. One day, there was a terrible fire at the factory and the magnesium oxide began to burn. I was reminded of an experiment a chemistry teacher had shown me back in high school. When magnesium oxide burns, it produces a dangerously bright light.\n\nDuring the fire, six men were blinded by that light. The entire building then burned to the ground. There was only one casualty. A man named David McIntyre. He had been fired from his job there the day before. It was believed that he ignited the magnesium oxide himself. The fire was so intense, it burned a large hole into the ground through the concrete foundations. It was assumed that David Mcintyre's body was vaporised by the 3000-degree heat.\n\nNow I know what that light was. And I know that man is still down there somewhere beneath that lonely patch of waste ground. Both haunting it and haunted by it, forever.",

Honestly, when I made that promise I was sure I’d keep to it. When my situation, uh, *developed* the following night I kept mum. Just like I said the last time that I came here, all I wanted to do was to move on.\n\nAnd I did move on, for a couple of months at least. I didn’t speak about Lola. I did my best not to think about Lola and, for a couple of months, it worked. The reality that my furry companion was used as a flesh puppet by some eldritch force became so distant that it could be ignored.\n\nUntil tonight.\n\nAfter months of not having to deal with the incomprehensible realities behind Morana Air, tonight I was confronted by those terrible questions again. I come here partially to clear my head, to try to make sense of what I had witnessed tonight. I also come here because you all have been spamming my DMs begging for closure. You wanted to know what actually happened to Lola, what those bleeding red lips in the crystal ball were, you wanted to know more about Morana Air. I still don’t have all of the answers to your questions, but if I tell you what happened tonight maybe my inbox will stop overflowing.\n\nThe main reason I’m here, however, is because I’m done with all this. I know I said it before, but I won’t say it again. This is the last time I’m going to stumble into this weird corner of the internet. This is the last time that I’m ever going to talk about Lola, at least about her corpse.\n\nI can’t understate how done I am with all of this. What happened, happened. I just want to go back to my regular, comprehensible life. Before I do, however, I guess I need to close the book on this chapter of my existence. Consider this post one big slamming of the pages.\n\nIf you’re not familiar, I came to this forum a couple months back to talk about my cat, Lola. She died right before I was meant to move halfway across the globe and I was forced to use Morana Air to transport her corpse. I’ve had Lola for over fourteen years, seeing her go was beyond heartbreaking but what I found at the Prague airport was considerably worse. My cat wasn’t dead anymore. My dead cat arrived alive and, well, different.\n\nHer high-pitched meows turned into strange guttural groans and she smelled like death itself. In utter confusion about the fate of my beloved pet, I went over to a local ‘*paranormal expert.*’ I’m pretty confident the woman was a scam artist but during the meeting my cat managed to get its paws on her crystal ball. Whatever was pulling the strings inside of my dead cat communicated with us. It talked about vessels and rings of salt and finding things that are not yet born. Crazy, spooky shit.\n\nThat’s when I called it quits.\n\nI left Lola’s animal container in front of a KFC, caught a tram back home and wrote my update post. The bloody lips, the terrible smell, the trauma of my dead cat being used as some *vessel* — it was all way too much. Like I said in the post, I was dead set on never thinking about the whole affair ever again. I sanctified that promise with a bottle of wine and some crying and then I went to sleep.\n\nBy the time I went to bed most of the rotting smell had aired out of my apartment. There was still a week left before the start of the school year and the forecast predicted clear skies. I went to sleep in hopes of waking up in the late morning to finally explore my neighborhood. Instead, I woke up before sunrise to my neighbor banging on my door.\n\nShe didn’t speak English and I didn’t speak Czech, but with a bit of help from Google Translate her issue with me became clear.\n\n‘*Your cat loud. Your cat loud on street. Take your cat, you bitch.*’\n\nBefore the translation was done, I could hear those horrible wails. Even though I left her on the other side of the city, my ‘cat’ had somehow found my apartment. The neighbor was furious and I understood her well enough to know she was talking about calling the police. The last thing I wanted was to have to explain the Lola situation to the authorities.\n\nThe moment I opened the door to the apartment complex the creature ran past my feet and scurried up the stairs. When I got to my front door the cat, once again, ignored me. Lola’s corpse rushed past the hallway and took a seat by the window. It’s only then that she acknowledged me.\n\nHer eyes kept on darting from me to a pigeon’s nest across the courtyard. She kept on staring and meowing and I had no idea what to do. For a couple of minutes, I desperately googled animal shelters, but none of them were open before sunrise. Filled with despair and slowly turning nauseous from the smell the cat dragged in, I tried going back to sleep.\n\nMuch like the night prior, I didn’t get any rest. Whenever my mind did drift away from the presence of the living feline corpse in my bedroom, it drifted towards memories of Berlin and adventurous school kids falling off of roofs. I laid there in the dark, trapped between getting the rest that I so desperately needed and finding a solution to the meowing corpse I was stuck with. When the dimness of my room gave way to a weak red glow I thought I had made it to sunrise.\n\nI was wrong.\n\n“*No, no, no! The time is running out. Soon I will be trapped. Soon the bind will be permanent. No, no, no! I require a thing not yet born, a circle of salt. This is not the vessel I have paid for*.”\n\nHer eyes shone like burning rubies from across the room. She was hanging atop the paper lampshade I had on my bedroom light. Those bleeding red lips were barely visible behind the folds of paper, yet the voice in my head was as clear as it had ever been. Low and terrible and haunting, it spoke to me about things not yet born and vessels.\n\nFor a couple breathless seconds, I watched the demoniac cat sway from side to side on my lampshade, but then I had enough. I got out of bed and demanded answers. I demanded to know what happened to my Lola and why the horrible beast was tormenting me. My sleep deprived screaming did nothing to faze the cat. When I finished, however, the voice in my skull spoke up once more.\n\n“*Yes, yes, yes! You care for the vessel. You love the vessel. You will help me and we shall both feel joy. Yes, yes, yes! An unborn thing, a circle of salt. I shall be a being of feathers and you shall see the vessel returned to its rightful owner*!”\n\nSmoke started to stem from beneath the cat’s body. Before I had a chance to ask another question the paper lampshade lit up in flames. The metal frame of the lamp quickly shed the burning paper. The fire burnt fast and I managed to douse my carpet with a jug of water before too much of my security deposit burnt away, yet by the time I took care of the blaze the cat was gone.\n\nShe had hopped out of the window, walked on the tin roofs and sat right by the pigeon’s nest across the courtyard. The creature’s gaze was singular. It wanted me to follow.\n\nCrawling eight stories in the air over ancient roofs just to follow a cat that was meant to be dead was the last thing I wanted to do with my morning. I don’t like heights and, more importantly, I’m not insane. Instead, I brewed myself a coffee in hopes of finding some rhyme and reason in my life.\n\nThe caffeine helped. The lack of a horrid smelling corpse in my apartment helped even more. As I stood by my window watching the cat, however, those demonic words kept on slithering through my head.\n\n“*You shall see the vessel returned to its rightful owner.”*\n\nMaybe it was the jolt from the coffee combined with the sleep deprivation. Maybe it was the promise of seeing Lola again. Maybe I just wanted the whole dead cat affair to end and crawling out of the window seemed like the only choice. Whatever the reason, that’s what I did. I got on all fours and crawled across the tin roofs to retrieve the thing that was not yet born.\n\nMy journey to the nest was quick. The metal beneath me groaned and somewhere in the back of my head there was a voice that kept on insisting I was going to tumble to my death — but I moved quickly.\n\nThe nest on the other side of the courtyard was constructed from straw and plastic bags and cigarette butts. A lone inch-sized egg sat in its center. As if mimicking the gentle movements of my Lola, the cat nudged the egg with its nose. Then, once my goal had been established, the cat scampered back on the roofs and returned to my apartment.\n\nMy journey to the nest was quick, yet the return took an eternity. The fear and insanity of where I was and what I was doing caught up with me. My movements were much less sure than the cats and my weight left behind a considerable trail of dents. About halfway through my journey a spot of roof where I had crawled over before shifted and sent me sliding down towards certain death. Luckily, I managed to stop myself from falling by shoving my foot into one of the ancient rain gutters. Most of that morning has been forcefully scrubbed from memory, but balancing on the edge of a roof with a pigeon egg between my thumb and forefinger will forever stay seared into my mind.\n\nWhen I entered my apartment again the cat seemed to express something resembling joy. Its howls were still dark and undeniably eldritch, but the cat moved around excitedly as I drew a circle with my salt shaker. I placed the tiny egg in the middle of the circle, making my kitchen counter look like a cartoon eye.\n\nMy mind was completely blank after crawling over roofs and I was barely holding myself together, but my guesses proved correct. When I placed the egg in the circle of salt the cat curled up around the egg and started to purr. It started to purr and it sounded exactly like my Lola.\n\nThe cat sat in the circle of salt and purred and slowly, ever so slowly, its fur started to bristle. The coarse gray of my dead cat’s fur faded into the fluffy white of Lola’s youth. With her eyes still closed, she started to meow. That horrible dark tenor was completely gone. The cat on the counter sounded just like my Lola again.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes the milkiness was completely gone from them. She could see again. She could see and she didn’t look a day older than when I moved into my first student flat. I had traveled halfway across the world and didn’t sleep for two days and crawled over roofs, but sitting in front of me was Lola.\n\nAt her feet, the pigeon egg started to hatch. The eggshell didn’t break from the top, it cracked from all sides as if it contained an inflating balloon. Whatever came out of it wasn’t a pigeon. The bird was jet black with red eyes and grew with each breath. Feathers sprouted from the bird as Lola’s fur grew fluffier and fluffier.\n\nShe looked just like the kebab hungry kitten that had followed me back home in university. She was small and fluffy and meowing just like she did when she was alive, but she was getting smaller. Lola was getting smaller and the black bird kept growing.\n\nWhen she was nothing but a fluffy clump of white, her fur started to retract. What was once a cute kitten turned into a hairless gerbil. In seconds she undid weeks of development until she was nothing but a thumb sized chunk of flesh. Before my Lola could be thrown backwards through time any further, the bird ate her.\n\nThe bird ate her, spread its wings and flew out of my apartment window.\n\nIn response, I spent three days in a crisis center barely holding onto my sanity. I walked out with the firm belief that *none of this happened*. That’s the only way I could keep my shit together enough for the start of the school year. It’s also why I didn’t come rushing back to this corner of the internet for an update.\n\nWhenever I had a moment alone all I could think about was the fur retracting into Lola’s little body. The first few nights were horrid. Prague, however, is a colorful enough city to help keep the mind occupied. I signed up for every new staff activity there was and scoured the internet for any interest groups that could take up my spare time. After a couple days the smell of rot left my apartment and after a couple washes my clothes smelled like clothes again.\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but I moved on. I kept myself busy with work and found friends and settled in my new three-year home. Occasionally, when I’d find myself crossing through I.P. Pavlova or whenever I stared out of my window for too long, I’d get uncomfortable but Prague and school kept me busy. I was happy.\n\nI was happy, but now I’m here.\n\nNow I’m here.\n\nOne of my friends threw a birthday picnic near the Letna Beer garden today. The picnic ended up being a lot more about booze than food and by the time it was packed up I was still hungry. The folks that were left at the end of the picnic wanted to go bar hopping but I was more than done for the night. There’s a tram across the river that takes me back home, so down from Letna hill I swung by the beer garden to grab a kebab.\n\nThe plan was to eat the kebab at home, but I was starving and the view from the bridge was nice. The Prague castle was all lit up and the tourist boats were floating by and the kebab was delicious. I was having the time of my life, but then, I saw something that brought the horror crashing back.\n\nTwo bright red eyes. Jet black feathers.\n\nIt sat on the railing, watching me. I tried to shoo it away. I tried to convince myself that it was just some weird diseased pigeon that had crawled into an old chimney, but the stare was undeniable.\n\nThe initial shock left me scared, but the alcohol turned that fear to anger. I demanded to know what the creature was, what it wanted from me. The pigeon stayed completely still, it’s featureless red eyes betraying no emotion. It isn’t until I asked about what happened to Lola that the horrible bird moved.\n\n“*The soul which you seek is dead.”* The dark voice thundered in my skull when the pigeon landed on a bridge lamp. *“It died far from here. Yes, Yes, Yes. What you saw on the morning of my rebirth was simply the muscle memory of a dead vessel.”*\n\nThe light glowed red and much brighter than any of the other street lamps. None of the drivers paid attention to me. Cars and trams and buses sped around me without a care in the world.\n\n*“As for my wants, I want nothing from you. No, No, No. Our paths have only crossed because of a clerical error. I have been invited to your realm to watch. I am here to witness the final century. I have no —*\n\nThe glass shattered beneath the bird’s claws. Instead of continuing to speak the pigeon sat back down on the railing and continued to stare. I forgot what I asked it, what other crumbs of information about the incomprehensible I begged for — but the bird didn’t answer. Instead, it launched at me, grabbed my kebab and flew away.\n\nI know I’ve said it before, but I’m done. I pray that whatever amount of psychic energy it took to commit this madness to paper is enough to help me move on. I’ve managed to live like a normal person for the past couple of months. \n\nI can do it again.\n\nI’m done. I’m done with weird fortune tellers and crawling over roofs and eldritch spirits and I’m done with dead cats. I’m done and I only have one piece of advice to offer:\n\nFor the love of God, never book a flight with [Morana Air](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11k3ds4/morana_air/).",

        "text": "I need some perspective here guys. I know it’s a cliché but I feel like I’m losing my mind. I just don’t know what to think anymore. It happened about a week ago. The day started as usual. I have this small wiener dog that I take on a walk every morning. He’s in good shape so we usually do about a 2 to 2.5h walk. His name is Schnitzel.\n\n\nWe’re lucky. My husband and I live in a small village, completely surrounded by forest. I was born here. My husband was one of the few tourists that came to check out our town a few years ago. We met at the local pub and after about a year of dating, we decided to settle down in my hometown rather than move to the city he's from. It truly is a lovely, quiet place. Some (most?) might say it’s too quiet but we’re both into that so for us it’s as close to paradise as it gets. \n\n\nAbout a decade and a half ago the town tried to put this place on the map, as they say. They launched a big campaign where they placed large billboards all over the country inviting everybody to our little piece of ‘extraordinary woodland’. Judging from the parking lots that were constructed all around the area, they were expecting hoards of tourists. Despite their best efforts, the expected flood of tourism never came. Occasionally some outdoorsy type will find their way here (my husband being one of them) but if every outsider that visited us last year came on the same day, we would still be able to fit all of them on ONE of the seven parking lots they constructed. \n\nNowadays the trails and parking lots are slowly being reclaimed by nature. Definitely a bummer for whoever was running the town back then (I can’t really remember, I was maybe 12) but for us locals, it’s wonderful. There are so many tracks to choose from. Granted, some of them you almost have to machete your way through, but the little plaques that you’re supposed to follow are still there so it’s pretty safe to wander around without having to be too afraid of getting lost.  \n\n\nThe trail we follow forms a loop that we can connect to from the very edge of our property. Because we take this trail all the time a little unofficial pathway started to form through the bit of forest we have to cross to get onto the actual hiking trail. My husband built us a little wooden gate a few years ago just in case some other hikers get a little too ‘wanderlusty’ and decide to follow the tracks into our yard. Not that there are many hikers. It’s fun, Schnitzel knows his way and we rarely encounter someone else so I let him off leash and he can just hop around, chasing leaves and catching sticks.\n\n\nSchnitzel was munching on his little pre-walk treat as I was sipping some tea on the porch while putting on my hiking boots. It was a very quiet morning, but nothing seemed particularly out of the ordinary. We got startled a little when a deer that had wandered into our yard suddenly made its escape. Schnitzel’s ears pulled back and she looked at me waiting for approval to go darting off after it. He’s a brave little sausage that one, I often wonder what he’d do if he actually were to catch up with many of his intended prey. But I nodded ‘no’ and being the good boy he is, he relaxed and got back to nibbling on his treat. \n\n\nI followed the deer with my eyes as it made its way back into the thick of the forest. I love staring into the trees, there is always something that pops out of the seemingly unmoving mass of leaves and twigs, demanding your attention. I do it for hours when I have the time. I tried, in vain, to look for the little songbirds or the family of squirrels that I know live in the tree that branches over into our garden. But this particular morning nothing rustled any leaves. After the deer had made its abrupt exit the forest went quiet. After a few minutes, my gaze traveled upwards. That was the first time I noticed the mist. Of course it wasn’t the first time it was misty in the morning. But most of the time it hovered just above the fields and meadows. This time, it seemed stuck at the top of the trees. Like it hadn’t quite made its way down yet today. It somehow seemed thicker than usual. It looked like if I was able to reach out and touch it I would be met with something that would have more of a marshmallowy consistency. At the time it definitely captured my attention but it didn’t particularly strike me as *too* odd. \n\n\nSchnitzel let out a little bark. I guess I took a little too long staring at the canopy. He finished his snack and was sort of urging me to get going. So I tied my shoes and we made our way to the edge of the garden, through the little wooden gate. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I chuckled when my little sausage tried to get over a fallen tree but got stuck halfway for a few seconds. About an hour into the trail, the road becomes rougher as tree roots stick out of the ground and there is some elevation gain in some parts. Nothing me and Schnitzel can’t handle. From that point on there is a ditch on one side of the road. About half of the year it’s filled with water but at the moment it’s dry and overgrown with grass and other plants. At a certain point, you come across a willow tree that grows out of the ditch and arches over the path. Once you pass that tree you walk for about half an hour before connecting to a bike lane that runs through the forest. Following this hardened road for a bit and eventually the trail loops back around to our property. I need you to understand: I *know* every inch of that trail. We’ve been walking it pretty much every day for the last 5 years or so. Ever since we got Schnitzel, this has been my daily morning routine. I know every tree, every protruding root, every twist and turn in the road.. So it doesn’t make sense that people keep insisting I must have gotten lost, that day.\n\n\nAnyway, we were happily hiking along when suddenly I noticed the mist starting to descend from the canopy. It came down fast and it was incredibly thick. Not quite the marshmallow fluff I had previously expected but as I breathed it in, I could almost feel the weight of it in my lungs. I called Schnitzel over so I could turn on the little blinky light on his collar and tried to move on. You couldn’t see a meter in front of you, but looking at the ground you could still follow the trail. Schnitzel stayed close and when he ventured a few steps further his red blinker was visible enough to not lose sight of him. We continued our walk for a little while, hoping the mist would clear up. Unfortunately, it didn’t. It seemed like it grew thicker and thicker. I could taste it now. It was ashy but with an iron-like aftertaste. Very unpleasant. Schnitzel kept shaking his little head with his tongue sticking out so I think he tasted it as well. Scared I’d lose him in the fog, I put on his leash and slowly kept moving forward. \n\n\nI could feel it before I heard it. When I was younger I suffered from panic attacks. The feeling wasn’t unfamiliar. It begins at the bottom of your back and quickly shoots upwards towards the back of your head. Like a jolt of electricity. It surprised me. I hadn’t felt like that in years. Schnitzel made me snap out of it. He let out a little whimper. When I looked down he was glued to my leg, tail tucked tightly between his legs. Whatever it was, he felt it too, I thought. \n\n\nThen, out of the nothingness that had surrounded us, a growl. Not like any animal I have ever heard of. Besides, the forest wasn’t known to harbor bears and wolf sightings had been sporadic at best. But there it was again. It sounded closer. I got scared. The hairs on my arms stood up straight. My mouth felt dry. A painful tension grabbed me by the throat. What was it? What could possibly be growling like that? Was it coming for us? A loud cracking noise broke my thoughts. Was that a tree? It sounded like a tree just snapped in half?! I looked down. Schnitzel stood behind me, hiding behind my legs. He was scared too. The next growl send a shiver down my spine, it sounded like whatever it was stood right beside us. I picked up the dog and started running. I could feel something running behind us. It made the ground shake, sending a shockwave forward with every step it took. In the corner of my eye I could see the roots of the trees being expelled from the ground. As if grenades exploded underneath the ground. It was so hard to breathe, as the mist filled my lungs it seemed to collect at the bottom, almost pulling me down to the ground. My legs were about to give out. I squeezed Schnitzel for what I thought would be the last time. If this was it, if my legs were going to give out, I had to let him go so at least he would have a chance to get away from whatever was chasing us. Preparing to let go, I held my breath for a second. \n\n\n**The willow tree**!\n\n\nSomehow, through the thickness of the mist, I could make out its contours. A final fear-fueled adrenaline spike gave me the energy to take a few more steps. I ran as fast as I could and slid into the ditch, underneath the tree. Schnitzel was shivering, but luckily he stayed quiet. I tried to hold my breath but kept having to take huge gasps of air. The ground-trembling footsteps kept coming closer and closer. The growling grew more and more intense. It sounded so angry. I closed my eyes as the ground shook so violently I thought it was going to swallow us. Expecting teeth and claws to reach out from the fog, I bit my tongue to stop myself from screaming.\n\n \nInstead, the growling grew distant. The shaking was first reduced to a slight tremble before it stopped completely. Like it was being engulfed by the increasingly thickening mist. Then, silence. Absolute silence. You think you can imagine what that’s like, but I assure you, you can’t. The fog was now so thick I was choking on it. But what should have been a loud cough came out in complete silence. I looked down at Schnitzel. He was frantically barking in all directions, but he too was unable to produce a sound. I struggled to breathe, I was dizzy and my arms and legs felt heavy. I fainted. \n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes the fog was gone. The sound of birds and rustling leaves filled the air. **Schnitzel**! I was worried he would have run away after I passed out, but he was still beside me. He yawned and stretched as if he had just woken up from a nap. Perhaps he lost consciousness as well. What the hell happened? I tried to get my bearings, but the trail seemed different. Like a massive storm just passed through. Maybe it did, maybe that’s what happened.. Maybe we misinterpreted the wind's howling for some creature that chased us into a ditch. How long were we out? What if it was hours?! I worried about my husband. He works from home so he would have immediately noticed if I was late. I needed to get back, and tell everybody we were alright. \n\n\nI grabbed Schnitzel under my arm, the trail was so covered in bits of bushes and vines, you’d barely know there was a path there at all. We walked around like this for about an hour before I started to fear something was wrong. We should have reached the concrete bike lane by now. Where did it go?! Whatever storm passed over us couldn’t possibly have completely covered an entire road, could it have? I let myself fall to the ground, holding my head, trying not to panic. I couldn’t be lost, we walked in the right direction keeping the ditch to our left the entire time. Schnitzel was getting antsy, he kept nudging my pocket. I keep his treats in there. How long had it been since we ate? Not knowing what else to do, I decided to go back to where we came from. I figured I must have made a wrong turn somewhere and started following a different ditch or something. \n\n\nAnother hour passed. I kept hoping we’d come across the willow tree we hid behind during.. whatever it was. But there was no willow to be found. Sure, there were plenty, but all were small and frail. Nothing like the big, sturdy one we walked passed évery morning for the last 5 years or so! \n\nAdmittedly, I panicked. I started screaming at the trees, angry about their seemingly nonchalant attitude toward our predicament. Eventually, I calmed down when I noticed I was upsetting my dog. We sat there for about an hour. Just thinking about what to do. I hated myself for not taking my phone with me that day. My husband always gave me a hard time when I did that. But the battery hadn’t charged fully during the night and I absentmindedly plugged it in before we left, thinking it’d be done by the time we got back. If we get out of this, I thought, my phone will néver leave my side again. I gave Schnitzel the rest of his treats. There weren’t many left anyway. I had decided the best course of action would be to just pick a direction and start walking. Sooner or later, I reasoned, I would have to come across some recognizable structure. At the very least we’d run into one of the many trail indicators. It took us hours. \n\nSchnitzel was really struggling toward the end, but I couldn’t keep carrying him all the time. We both had no energy left. My feet were killing me. I had no idea what time it was, but considering how long we had been out here, surely it would get dark soon. I didn’t know what to do. We were exhausted. I let myself fall onto the ground. Schnitzel pretty much collapsed right beside me. I tried to comfort her the best I could by rubbing her little paws. You could tell they were sore from strutting around for what seemed like forever. I fought back the tears, trying to do the breathing exercises that I was thought to combat my anxiety attacks. \n\n*Look down - Breathe in for 4 seconds - Close your eyes - Hold your breath for 7 seconds while slowly raising your head until you’re looking up - Open your eyes - Breathe out for..* **A light!**\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I saw a light through the trees. A second ago I could barely put one foot in front of the other, but now I was running. I swooped up Schnitzel like he was made of feathers and ran as fast as I could toward the light. The closer I got the more I started to recognize the trail again. The path became more and more defined. I was home!\n\nThe little wooden gate at the end of our garden nearly flew out of its hinges when I bouldered my way through. During the final dash, I started to yell towards the house: ‘We’re fine! We’re here! We’re back!’ Hoping my husband was home and not out in the forest with a search party. I swung open the door, half expecting the full accompaniment of the police force! Or.. at least one cop or.. surely the forest ranger would be there, comforting my poor husband, distraught with grief. But all was quiet. I stood there, exhausted, covered in cuts and bruises from rummaging through the woods. My husband came out of his office. He yawned and scratched his head. Coffee in hand. Confused about why I kept yelling at the house that we’d returned. He looked at the state we were in and jokingly said ‘Djeezus hun, did you guys decide to *roll* through the forest today?’.\n\nSo here I am. \n\nMy husband took me to the doctor because I told him what happened to us. That we were gone for hours, maybe days depending on how long we were passed out. But he doesn’t believe me. Maybe.. Maybe I don’t believe it either. We were gone for about 2 hours, *he says*. No longer than usual. The only proof I have are my bruises. But everybody keeps reminding me that I’m clumsy and it wouldn’t be the first time I came close to falling in a ditch whilst being distracted by a bird or something. Schnitzel doesn’t want to follow the trail anymore. I keep telling everybody that that’s not normal. He loved our morning walks. He frolicked through the woods.. Ever since that foggy morning he’s reluctant to go into the forest with me.. I don’t know.. perhaps everybody is right, perhaps he’s just reacting to my anxiety.. Could I have imagined the whole thing? Did I really stumble down the ditch, hit my head and in a brief moment of confusion, conjured up this elaborate experience in my mind? \n\nThey want me to start taking my anti-anxiety meds again and try to forget the whole ordeal. Is that even possible? Can you just get over something like this? Maybe if I had some actual evidence of what happened to us.. I can’t stop thinking about going back out there. With my phone this time. Surely if I had my gps and I could just take a picture of what’s out there.. People would have to believe me, right? *If* there is something out there in the first place. But then, if there actually *is* something out there that growls and shakes the earth when it moves, surely I should not be chasing it, right?  ..*right*?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, as I walked out onto the porch, the mist was up in the tree canopy again.",

        "text": "i feel like i'm losing my mind. i must be going crazy. that's the only logical explanation to what's going on... but still, maybe if i talk about it, i'll realize it's just all in my head and stop worrying about it.\n\nyou see, the thing is... something weird started happening since last week tuesday. i was having an awful day the monday before. i was out in town, looking for a dress to this stupid work party i have coming up. i severely hate clothes shopping, because of how busy the clothing stores are, and the whole having to try on multiple items in such a short time span. it's exhausting.\n\ni was having an awful day, because store after store, i couldn't find anything i liked. either it sat weird on me, or the fabric was itchy, or this, or that. i was just about to give up and go home, and just skip the event. it was probably my fault anyway that i left it so last minute.\n\nbut... just as i was about to walk out of the store, i saw the loveliest purple dress hanging on a rack. i must admit, it wasn't properly hanged, more like hooked onto the side, the way people sometimes do when they no longer want something. i thought the dress got abandoned, that whoever picked it no longer wanted it. \n\ni checked the label - it was my size. i went to fit it on, and, it was a perfect! i couldn't find a single fault. i immediately went out to the checkout line.\n\nwhile waiting to pay, i heard a customer talk to one of the floor ladies, saying she turned her back for two seconds on an item she chose, and then suddenly it was gone. thinking back now, i should've realized then, but then also - there's so many people that just hook whatever they don't want anymore everywhere! \n\ni reached the till. the cashier scanned the dress, and just as i paid, i was approached by the other customer. \n\na tap on the shoulder. “excuse me. i think you took my dress. that was the last item on the rack, and i had picked it up for myself.” \n\n“ i'm sorry,” i said. “ i found this dress abandoned on a rack.” \n\n“ it wasn't abandoned,” and i could see she was starting to get angry. “you took it while i had my back turned. you had no right to do that.” \n\ni was uncertain what to do. but i already paid, and... i really wanted the dress. i apologized again, and said, “ i can't do anything now. i already paid for it.” \n\nhurriedly, i had taken my bag and rushed out of the store, before i started feeling guilty enough to return the dress. i should've returned the dress. \n\ni went to my event that night. it was an awful night anyway. one of my coworkers got drunk enough to spill her red wine all over me, and outside of that i just wasn't having fun. so after ten, i went home, got out of the dress, left it on the floor and went to bed. \n\nand then things started to get weird.\n\ni woke up halfway through the night to go to the bathroom, and when i climbed out of bed, i stepped in something wet and slimy and... warm. but when i looked, it was just dry wooden floors beneath my feet. i went to the bathroom, and on my way back to bed i passed my mirror. it looked like i was leaving wet footprints behind, but again, the floor was dry when i looked.\n\ni thought maybe i was just half dreaming up some nonsense again, and by the time i woke up in the morning i had forgotten about it, until now. \n\neverything was fine during the day. i went to work, went back home and wanted to start preparing dinner when i realized i was out of some necessary ingredients. the entire time i had this itch at the back of my neck though, like maybe im being stared at. but there was no one there, because duh, im alone at home. at some point, before leaving the house, i thought i saw a face peeking at me around the corner, but when i looked again, it was just the shadows that caught my eye. \n\ni went to the grocery store, got what i needed and as i was paying, i heard two old ladies whisper about someone who got hit by a car. they said the person died instantly, bleeding out all over the side of the road. \n\nwhen i got home, the purple wine stained dress was laying in a heap right in front of my bedroom door. i was pretty sure that i had dumped it in the laundry basket along with all my other clothes, but i don't know, maybe i dropped it without realizing. this time, i made sure i put it in the laundry basket. \n\nwhen i went to bed that night, i heard these tiny weird tapping sounds, like a finger against a surface. a rhythmic tap, tap, tap. then it'd stop for a while. and then again. \n\ntap, tap, tap. \n\nit's just a tree branch against a window, right? \n\nsmall things kept happening, that i will admit did start to freak me out. the tapping sounds, coming from all places in the house. feeling like im being stared at. sometimes, catching a glimpse of a face peeking around a corner. stepping in slimy, invisible puddles. once, i thought i saw blood seeping over my floor. and, the dress. i'd find it in odd places in my home, places i didn't put it. \n\non sunday, my sister sent me a news article. “how  horrible is this? this poor girl”, accompanied the link.\n\nit was about the girl from last monday. she had died a few minutes after i left the shop. the article said that she had left the shop in a hurry, crossed the road without looking and got hit by an oncoming bus. dead on impact. one of the store ladies had made a comment and said she had left quite angry due to a “customer dispute”. \n\nit made me feel awful. i should've returned the dress and she wouldn't have died. \n\nand now... it's monday morning. six fifteen am. i woke up a few minutes ago. and, standing over my bed, leaning over me, was the bloody, disfigured girl from monday. her blood dripped all over my face. \n\nplease tell me it's just in my head. that it's guilt over her death. please tell me she's not actually in my house, watching me. im losing my mind. \n\nwhat if she's here to get revenge?",

        "text": "Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve been seeing the man down the hall.  \n\nI don’t really know how to describe him, since he only appears when it’s really dark, and he’s always bathed in shadow.  \n\nIt doesn’t matter where I live.  We moved twice when I was younger and it didn’t change the fact that he showed up every night when I was heading to bed.\n\nMy parents told me stories that I didn’t even remember, telling me that I never wanted to go to bed at night.  They said I would get upset and cry, saying “the man was going to get them.”  But they always just thought it was an excuse to stay up late.  \n\nThe first memory I have of seeing him was when I was about five years old.  I had just left the bathroom from brushing my teeth when I looked up and saw him, just standing there, staring at me, from down the hall.  Not moving, not doing much of anything, just watching.  I remember getting into bed and thinking whoever that was, they were going to kill my parents.  I wondered why they hadn't noticed him, and why they weren’t screaming and telling him to get out.  \n\n“Mom, is the bad man gone!?” I yelled to my parents after a few minutes. \n\nEventually my mom came in and told me everything was okay, and that I’d just been imagining things.  \n\nI had a bad dream.  That was what they always told me.  But I wasn't even asleep yet, so how could it be a dream?\n\nAnd it got worse and worse.  \n\nI started seeing the shadow man in the hallway every single night, and realized he’d been there all along and some nights I just hadn’t noticed him.  He blended in so well with the darkness - it was like he was made of the night.  \n\nSoon, I started to notice that he was getting closer.  He was no longer in the living room, where my parents were.  He was just inside the threshold of the doorway leading into the hallway.  \n\nIt started to happen every night when I left the bathroom from brushing my teeth.  I would open the door and look down the hall and he would be standing there.  A little closer every time.  \n\nWhy was this happening to me, I’d wonder to myself, ducking into my bedroom and hiding beneath the covers.  I’d have trouble sleeping, picturing that hideous shadowy figure inching closer and closer all the time.  \n\nWhen I moved out from my parent’s house and went to college, the shadow man actually went away for a little while.  Or at least I tried not to notice him.  I tried not to think about him.  I brushed my teeth in my bedroom and went pee in plastic bottles, doing anything I could to avoid that dreaded look down the hallway before bed.  That was where I always saw him, so I thought maybe I could get rid of him by just avoiding looking.  \n\nIt seemed to work for a while.  Ignorance is bliss, after all.  \n\nI went through college and graduated with honors, finally able to focus on my studies.  \n\nI got married and had kids.  We got a dog and moved into a house in the suburbs.  \n\nAnd I forgot all about the shadow man in the hallway.  If I did think about him, it was dismissed immediately as a childhood nightmare, a bad waking dream.  \n\nBut something happened tonight.  I did something which I haven’t done in a long, long time.  I left my bedroom during the night to go to use the toilet.  \n\nThe ensuite bathroom we have next to our master bedroom was having plumbing issues.  I’d have to use the one down the hall, I realized.  \n\nI broke out into a cold sweat for reasons I couldn’t understand.  Why was I so scared to walk down the hall?  \n\nStill, I did it, entering the bathroom and turning on the light, scared for a second of what might be lurking in the darkness waiting for me.  \n\nBut there was nothing.  \n\nI did my business and washed my hands, then exited the bathroom and looked down the hall, taking a step and then freezing mid-stride before I moved another inch.  \n\nHe was there.  \n\nThe man in the hallway.  The shadow man from my childhood nightmares.  \n\nHe’d always been so far away, impossible to make out the details of him.  But now he was SO CLOSE.  \n\nJust inches away from me, moving almost imperceptibly closer by the second.  I could finally make out the details of his horrifying face - the decaying, gray skin, shriveled and torn.  Riddled with sores and weeping wounds.  Fat black worms crawled out from holes in his flesh.  \n\nI slammed the door of the bathroom shut, hiding inside.  \n\nBreathing heavily, I locked the door and sat down with my back pressed against it.  I was just waiting for him to try to force his way in.  \n\nBut he didn’t.  Instead, he’s just waiting outside for me.  Getting closer.  Always inching closer.  \n\nAnd I don’t know what’s going to happen when he finally reaches me.  But I have a pretty good guess.  \n\nI’m hiding in the bathroom now, typing this up.  There’s nothing else to do but sit here and wait for the sun to rise.  I’m not going back out there again until then…\n\nExcept…\n\nMy wife is calling for me.  I can hear her opening the bedroom door.  \n\n“Honey?  Why are you just standing at the end of the hall like that?” she’s saying to the shadow man outside.  \n\nI want to yell, I want to scream, to tell her that’s not me.  But before I can, she’s already speaking again.  \n\n“Come to bed,” I hear her say, and the sounds of floorboards creaking can be heard moving up the hall away from me.  The bedroom door closes softly. \n\nHe’s not in the hallway anymore, I realize with horror.  \n\nNow he’s in the bedroom.

        "text": "I am now 25 years old and have been carrying this burden around with me for a long time. I feel that if I write it down it will ease a lot of the issues that I deal with on a daily basis. I feel a lot of guilt even though I didn’t do anything wrong, I have done things that I’m not proud of and always blamed it on my past. Something today made all of the memories come flooding back. \n\nNobody knows who killed my family, the killer apparently fled the scene and was never caught, but I have a terrifying feeling that my best friend killed them. I know that this couldn’t be possible, as my best friend was my imaginary friend named Timothy. \n\nEight might seem quite old to have an imaginary friend but I didn’t have any friends of my own, for some reason other kids took an instant dislike to me. I have a vivid memory of being rejected constantly as a young child, asking whether I could join a game of tag or cowboys and Indians just to be told no. Timothy was always there when I needed him, he lived in the cupboard in my old room. He was the same age as me, with bright blonde hair, blue eyes and he dressed a lot older than his age. He looked like he was wearing the sort of clothes that my grandfather would wear. \n\nMy childhood was often lonely; my father and mother drank almost all the time and my older sister was a saint in their eyes. The truth though was she used to terrorise me and physically abuse me. There was even one time she pushed me down the stairs because I wouldn’t let her have my cookie. My parents though, would always blame me or just told me to toughen up,. She is a girl they always used to say to me, stop being such a wimp. She was 13 years old and towered over me, so for my 8 year old self I felt  threatened and scared. There were however some brief good times that I can remember, that was in between all of the drinking and torment. \n\nThis was one of them days, my parents took us to the zoo, it was like we were a family all day, no drinking, no verbal or physical abuse it was surreal. When I got home, Timothy seemed angry that I had been out all day, I told him how wonderful it was, how I felt like part of a normal family. He said that it wouldn’t last and something has to be done to help me. \n\nHe was as always, correct, that evening my parents went out leaving my sister to look after me. She left me alone for most of the evening until she got back from her friends. That’s when she became bored, she marched up the stairs and slammed into my door. It flung open as she demanded that I clean her shoes. I naturally said no, that it wasn’t my problem that her shoes were dirty. She proceeded to grab my neck and force it down to the ground, she then screamed at me to “lick them clean” while shoving my head into her feet. I was whaling in anger and pain as I clawed at her legs, begging her to let go. \n\nAll of a sudden, she let out an uncontrollable scream as I felt her grip loosen as she flew backwards out of my room, like someone had pushed her. As she lay on the floor outside, my door slammed shut, and my drawers next to my door slid across it blocking anyone from opening it. I looked over and Timothy was stood next to the door, his normally kind face was now contorted in anger. He had never been able to interact with objects or people, he was in my head. Even now, in my almost hazy memory I could see the rage in his face, was my imagination this good as a kid? I had always thought in my anger I had shoved my sister off me and barricaded the door. My mind then imagined Timothy doing it to cover up the bad memories. \n\nThis is when Timothy turned, he shouted at me in frustration. How could I let them treat me like this? How he had had enough of seeing me suffer this way. I was scared and just didn’t know what to say back, he was right. He was always there for me in the aftermath of the abuse. I always thought this was my coping mechanism, almost like I had developed a complex friend so I wasn’t alone in my time of need. Now looking back, he felt so real. Later that evening I heard my parents get home, I could tell they were drunk and heard the muffled complaints from my sister through the door. I cried non-stop in terror as I knew how they would react as I rushed onto my bed and under the blanket. \n\nI heard my dad crash up the stairs and rattle my door handle, when he couldn’t get in he banged and smashed into my door. He was shouting abuse on what I had apparently done to my sister. He said he was going to kill me! I was still hid under my blanket, tears rolling down my face. \n\nI then heard Timothy’s voice, it was a lot calmer then before. \n\n“Stay hidden, It will all be over soon” \n\nThe next thing I heard from outside the safety of my room, still gives me nightmares: the agonizing screams of my mother and sister. My dad suddenly leaving the other side of my door and running down stairs. A few seconds later he was begging for his life, before letting out a terrifying cry. I heard a large thud, then silence. I waited under my blanket for what seemed like days until I saw the glow of blue flashing lights. The muffled sound of people once again sounded from outside my room. My handle soon turned as two sets of footsteps walked in, they threw off my blanket as I let out a teary yell. It was the police. I can’t really remember too much after that, I didn’t understand why my room wasn’t barricaded still by the drawers. I never saw Timothy again after that night. \n\nI consequently went to live with my paternal grandparents, they were the complete opposite to my parents in every way. I found out a few years later that they had tried for a number of years to get custody of me and my sister but were shut out of our lives almost entirely. I asked them many times what happened to my family and for a long time they refused to tell me any real details other than ‘they were killed by a home intruder’. I get why, there were so many questions that didn’t get answered. My grandfather passed away last week and I have been helping my grandmother with some of his old stuff. \n\nWe were looking through his parents old photo album from the 1930’s, there was a black and white photo of him as a boy. As I looked at the second photo my stomach dropped, my young grandfather was stood next to a boy that looked identical to Timothy. I uttered through shaky words to my grandmother, who was that? She replied, that was your grandfathers brother. He tragically died when he was a boy from tuberculosis. I snapped the book closed, as my breathing grew deeper. My grandmother was concerned by my reaction, I explained to her about my imaginary friend named Timothy, I had when I was a boy. How he always looked out for me and that he looked exactly like the boy in the photo. \n\nShe said that maybe I had seen a photo of him when I was young and imagined him in real life, but I can’t think of when I would have seen the photo of him. \n\nIt makes me wonder looking back, did my overactive imagination create Timothy, or was it actually really him looking out for me?\n\nIf it was him though, like his ghost, spirit or whatever, could he have really killed my family?",

        "text": "An alarm wakes Melanie up at 7:00 AM. She snoozes it once. Twice. Three times until she finally pulls herself out of bed. This has become her routine. She could simply set an alarm for 7:30, but she has convinced herself this is the better way.\n\nShe has to shower in a rush. Any more than ten minutes, and she’ll fall behind on her morning routine. It isn’t enough time to properly condition her long, chestnut hair, but she doesn’t want to be late for work. Later than usual, that is. Almost without fail, Melanie clocks in five minutes after her shift was supposed to begin. She doesn’t see this as an issue, but her manager disagrees and has spoken to her about her tardiness on several occasions. Each time, Melanie promises to be more timely, yet she continues to snooze her alarm three times each morning.\n\nMelanie works as a teller at a local credit union. She only makes $18 per hour, and for that price, she does not feel particularly compelled to do anything her manager asks of her. Her days are monotonous. Every week she sees the same faces, gets the same attitudes. Melanie always regards them with a polite smile, but the smile drops the moment they turn their backs.\n\nShe hates this job, but she can’t imagine what else she would do. She regrets going to that expensive private college. She regrets even more her useless degree that has forced her into an unfulfilling career just to stay afloat in the sea of debt she’s accrued. Her life is miserable. Sometimes she wishes it would just end, but she would never harm herself. No, she couldn’t do that. But sometimes she imagines getting into an accident on her way to work or getting sick with something incurable. Neither would be very pleasant ways to go out, but at least it would all finally be over.\n\nAfter her daily eight hours of hell are up, Melanie walks two blocks to the parking garage and climbs the stairs to the fourth story where she parks. Some days, she’s lucky enough to find parking on the third or even the second story, but she seldom remembers this by the end of the day and winds up climbing to the fourth story anyway, only to have to climb back down.\n\nShe drives a 2001 Subaru Forester that’s been leeching her funds for years, but she can’t afford to replace it. The car is an ugly gray color with patches of rust lining the body along the bottom. One day soon, it will fall apart, then Melanie will be in serious trouble. But for now, it gets her where she needs to go, which is mostly to and from work but also to her favorite bar on Friday nights where she meets her friends. Most of her old college friends left town after graduation, leaving Melanie with only a small handful of people who care enough about her to want to spend any time with her.\n\nHer drink of choice is a whiskey sour. After one or two of these, she feels loose enough to begin flirting with the other patrons. Most nights, she still goes home alone, but on occasion, she’ll be accompanied by a man or woman who she deemed to be worth her time. None of them end up being good enough for her in the end. Most are sent packing the morning after, but a few lucky ones have stuck around for a few weeks here and there.\n\nThere is no one in the bar tonight whom Melanie wants to strike up a conversation with. The group of young men in the corner booth is raucous and unappealing. She does her best to avoid making eye contact with any of them throughout the night. The crowd at the bar is no better. A line of pathetic looking older men with guts that suggest they spend most of their nights just like this, drowning away their miserable lives.\n\nThe two friends Melanie met at the bar tonight had already gone home with their hookups. Their standards had always been lower than Melanie’s. Nevertheless, she’s alone now, and it’s getting late. There’s little parking downtown around the bar, so she’ll have to walk a few blocks to get back to her car. There are several alleyways along the route that make her uncomfortable. She can’t see all the way down them, and she fears whoever might be lurking in the dark.\n\nBut in the end, it is not the alleyways that truly scare Melanie tonight. It is the small park across the street from her car. As she wraps around to the driver’s side door, she thinks she spots something move in the dark. It’s not clear. Just a shadow that passes behind a tree. She waits, listening for any signs that something may be amiss. Nothing comes. Perhaps it was nothing after all.\n\nBetter safe than sorry, Melanie pulls the car door open and quickly climbs inside, locking the doors as soon as she can. She redirects her gaze to the park one more time, to that tree. Again, there’s nothing. She starts the engine and pulls away, leaving the park, and whatever she thought she saw in the dark, behind her.\n\nMelanie wakes up late Saturday morning. She checks her phone and sees that the day is approaching 12:00 PM. More disappointingly, she sees she has no messages. No one is trying to reach her. She rolls over, trying to go back to sleep, but the sun is too bright. Melanie relents, and pulls herself out of bed.\n\nSaturdays are Melanie’s personal days, though usually not by choice. She spends most of the day lounging on the couch, absentmindedly watching television. She hopes for someone to call her and invite her to anything that will get her out of the house. This almost never happens. And thus, Melanie wastes away another Saturday.\n\nIt is nearing sunset when Melanie starts to notice something is off. There’s nothing discernibly wrong, but she can’t shake the chill on the back of her neck. She closes the blinds on all the windows and double-checks the locks, but she still cannot shake the unease. The unmistakable feeling of being watched. She returns to the couch and tries to take her mind off the feeling, but she continues to look over her shoulder periodically.\n\nShe does not sleep well that night. Tossing and turning and bolting upright with every sound. Normally, she does not bother locking her bedroom door, but she does tonight. She even checks under her bed and inside the deepest corners of her closet as if she were a child searching for bogeymen. The emptiness she finds does little to put her mind at ease. Someone *is* watching her. She’s certain of it. She can *feel* it.\n\nEvery dark corner of the room could be harboring something evil. Melanie sits up against the bed frame and clicks on the lamp on the nightstand, bathing the room in a soft yellow light. This puts her at ease somewhat. She can see now that the room is empty. She sits and stares at the walls for a long while before her eyes start to feel heavy. Eventually, she drifts off.\n\nMelanie manages to get at least a few hours of sleep, and when she wakes up, she’s relieved to find her paranoia is gone. Perhaps she had been foolish last night. There had been no one there at all. She had simply gotten too far into her own head, and it had cost her a good night’s sleep.\n\nShe moves through her Sunday groggily, leaving the house in the afternoon to run her weekly errands. She starts by going to a coffee shop for a little pick-me-up. Then, she realizes her tank is running low, so she stops for gas. Next, she goes to the crafts store to buy three new rolls of yarn. She endeavors to make knitting a hobby but can never compel herself to work at it for more than thirty minutes at a time. Finally, she goes to the grocery store and watches miserably as the price slowly ticks up above $200 with each item the cashier runs across the scanner.\n\nThe mid-afternoon sun beats down brightly on Melanie when she leaves the store. As her eyes adjust, she doesn’t see the car backing out of the parking space next to her. The moron in the car must be blind too because he doesn’t see Melanie walking directly behind him. He hits her, not hard, but enough to knock her off balance. She loses her grip on her grocery bags, and their contents spill out across the pavement.\n\nSuddenly, all eyes are on Melanie. Everything in the parking lot seems to come to a sudden stop as the world focuses its burning gaze on her. Her first instinct is to try to grab some of her lost groceries before they can roll too far away from her, but as she reaches for the first item, she stops cold. A tingle prickles up her spine as that feeling returns, the very same thing she felt last night. The feeling of being watched, but not just by anyone--by someone sinister. Someone with malicious intent.\n\nMelanie is vaguely aware of the oaf who just hit her with his car barking apologies behind her, but she doesn’t care about that right now. Her eyes are busy scanning every face in the parking lot. They’re all watching her, but none of them seem to harbor anything more than concern or curiosity. A few seem entertained, but she sees no one that wants to do her harm. Yet the feeling persists. A few of the people watching Melanie begin to take notice. It’s written all over her face. She is terrified.\n\nMelanie scoops up an armful of groceries and leaves the rest, practically running to her car. She throws them haphazardly into the backseat and gets away from the parking lot as fast as she can.\n\nThe next day, Melanie arrives to work nearly an hour late--much worse than her usual five minutes. Her manager is furious with her, but even he can see that something is very wrong with Melanie and backs off before laying into her too harshly. There are deep bags under her eyes, her hair is frayed at the ends, and her skin is pale. He must think she’s sick, but he’s wrong. In reality, Melanie has gone another night with no sleep, having spent last night barricaded in her room with a kitchen knife in her hand as she watched the door and windows intently. The lack of sleep and the stress have taken a toll on her.\n\nMelanie gets to work right away. Clients will start coming in soon, and she needs to be ready. She races through her opening procedures and finishes just as the first client comes through the door. A man well into his sixties with a thin head of hair and heavy creases across his forehead. Melanie knows this man. He comes in almost every Monday morning, yet something feels different today. As Melanie processes his transaction, she can feel the weight of his eyes on her. She tries to speed up the process, but loses count of his bills and has to start over. The whole time, she can hear the old man’s wheezing breaths from across the counter. Her hands are shaking now. She tries to steady them to no avail. The burning heat of the old man’s gaze is throwing her into a panic. Finally, she hands him his withdrawal. Her shoulders sag with relief when he goes on his way. And then the next one comes.\n\nOne face after another, each one staring down at her with their beady eyes. Any one of these men could be the one who has been watching her. The tall ginger man, the man in the blue three piece suit, or even the middle-aged man with a slight limp on his left leg. How many faces does she see every day? Every week? There’s no telling what thoughts lurk behind their eyes. She’d never know if one of them wanted to hurt her until it was too late.\n\nA hand lands on Melanie’s shoulder. Her coworker. Young and blonde and skinny. She probably thinks she’s prettier than Melanie, but she’s wrong. She’s come to cover Melanie’s lunch break. Melanie almost runs out of the building after she leaves the counter, but she knows she can’t afford to take the afternoon off. She doesn’t eat a single bite of the sandwich she brought for lunch. This is unwise. She needs to keep her strength up, especially in such stressful times. The clock ticks away, and Melanie dreads each second that passes until her thirty minute reprieve is up. She stands shakily and walks back to the counter.\n\nMelanie tries not to look any of her afternoon clients in the eye. She can’t bear their eyes. Because of this, it takes her a moment to recognize him when the man in the brown leather jacket comes up to the counter. When she hears his voice, she looks up in shock at his face. What could he be doing here? In the nearly two years Melanie has worked at the bank, this man has never come in on a Monday. It couldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\n\nMelanie takes a step back from the counter as she meets the man’s eyes. They’re practically bulging out of his skull. He smiles, revealing grimy yellow teeth, and hands Melanie a check he wishes to deposit. His fingers happen to brush up against Melanie’s as she takes the check. An accident? Melanie recoils slightly, and the man’s smile falters for a moment. Then, he leans in with a smug expression. He always tries to flirt with Melanie when he comes in. It’s always made her uncomfortable but now more than ever. He stares longingly at her as she processes his transaction. Perhaps he’s wondering what she might look like without her clothes--perhaps, even, without her skin.\n\nIf there truly is someone stalking her, this man has to be the one. Who else could it be? Surely, there is no one else who could make Melanie feel this way. This afraid.\n\nA receipt curls out of the printer. Melanie tears it away and goes to hand it to the man. As she does, he takes hold of her hand. There is no mistaking it this time. This is no accident. Melanie’s eyes go wide in shock, and before she even knows she’s doing it, she’s taken a letter opener from the behind the counter and plunged the point down into the man’s hand, pinning it to the wooden countertop.\n\nThe man in the leather jacket lets out a truly pathetic scream as his blood pools onto the counter. Melanie watches it course out from beneath his skin for only a moment before she runs. She flees out the back door and sprints to the parking garage where she’ll find her car. She’ll drive home in a frenzy, blowing through stop signs and paying no mind to the speed limit. She’s lucky to make it home without attracting the attention of the police.\n\nWhen she does make it home, Melanie locks the door behind her and crashes onto the floor where she stays for hours, sobbing like a child. There is blood on her hand, and she’s getting it all over her pretty face as she tries to wipe away the tears. She waits for the police to come and take her away, but they never do. She is alone.\n\nAs far as she knows.\n\nShe does not know that *I* am here with her. That I am always with her. I watch her all day while she works from the skylight above. Then I follow her home and enter the house through one of the basement windows. Melanie does not realize that I have broken the lock on this window, or she would have surely gotten it fixed by now. She is responsible that way.\n\nI sneak up the basement steps, deftly avoiding the fifth step from the top that creaks under my weight. From this point, I quietly make my way to her bedroom closet and climb up into the overhead hatch that leads to the crawlspace. Melanie has never paid any attention to this hatch. That is most fortunate for me. It gives me a place to hide, and when she’s not paying attention, I can sneak down and continue my watching.\n\nI know everything about you, Melanie. I know what you do every day from dawn until dusk. I know what you like, and I know what you hate. I know what you think and what you feel. Our connection means a great deal to me Melanie, and I can see that you’re starting to see *me*, too. That makes me so happy. And so sad. Because I long for you to see me, Melanie, but I know what will happen when you do. You won’t accept me. You won’t understand. I know you well enough to say this for certain. You’ll want to call the police. You’ll want me to be taken away from you, and I just cannot allow that to happen.\n\nSo, Melanie, when you finally see me, this part of our lives will have to end. I will no longer be able to watch you, but I will *keep* you. I simply cannot give you up. I will keep you where no one can find you. I’m sure you’ll try to run, but you won’t make it very far once I’ve sliced your Achilles. And I’m sure you’ll try to call for help, but no one will be able to hear you once I’ve removed your vocal cords. You will be mine alone.\n\nUntil that day, I will continue to watch you. Your life brings me so much joy, even if it does not bring much to you, Melanie.",

        "text": " \n\nI need some perspective here guys. I know it’s a cliché but I feel like I’m losing my mind. I just don’t know what to think anymore. It happened about a week ago. The day started as usual. I have this small wiener dog that I take on a walk every morning. He’s in good shape so we usually do about a 2 to 2.5h walk. His name is Schnitzel.\n\nWe’re lucky. My husband and I live in a small village, completely surrounded by forest. I was born here. My husband was one of the few tourists that came to check out our town a few years ago. We met at the local pub and after about a year of dating, we decided to settle down in my hometown rather than move to the city he's from. It truly is a lovely, quiet place. Some (most?) might say it’s too quiet but we’re both into that so for us it’s as close to paradise as it gets. \n\nAbout a decade and a half ago the town tried to put this place on the map, as they say. They launched a big campaign where they placed large billboards all over the country inviting everybody to our little piece of ‘extraordinary woodland’. Judging from the parking lots that were constructed all around the area, they were expecting hoards of tourists. Despite their best efforts, the expected flood of tourism never came. Occasionally some outdoorsy type will find their way here (my husband being one of them) but if every outsider that visited us last year came on the same day, we would still be able to fit all of them on ONE of the seven parking lots they constructed. So now the trails and parking lots are slowly being reclaimed by nature. Definitely a bummer for whoever was running the town back then (I can’t really remember, I was maybe 12) but for us locals, it’s wonderful. There are so many tracks to choose from. Granted, some of them you almost have to machete your way through, but the little plaques that you’re supposed to follow are still there so it’s pretty safe to wander around without having to be too afraid of getting lost.  \n\nThe trail we follow forms a loop that we can connect to from the very edge of our property. Because we take this trail all the time a little unofficial pathway started to form through the bit of forest we have to cross to get onto the actual hiking trail. My husband built us a little wooden gate a few years ago just in case some other hikers get a little too ‘wanderlusty’ and decide to follow the tracks into our yard. Not that there are many hikers. It’s fun, Schnitzel knows his way and we rarely encounter someone else so I let him off leash and he can just hop around, chasing leaves and catching sticks.\n\nSchnitzel was munching on his little pre-walk treat as I was sipping some tea on the porch while putting on my hiking boots. It was a very quiet morning, but nothing seemed particularly out of the ordinary. We got startled a little when a deer that had wandered into our yard suddenly made its escape. Schnitzel’s ears pulled back and she looked at me waiting for approval to go darting off after it. He’s a brave little sausage that one, I often wonder what he’d do if he actually were to catch up with many of his intended prey. But I nodded ‘no’ and being the good boy he is, he relaxed and got back to nibbling on his treat. \n\nI followed the deer with my eyes as it made its way back into the thick of the forest. I love staring into the trees, there is always something that pops out of the seemingly unmoving mass of leaves and twigs, demanding your attention. I do it for hours when I have the time. I tried, in vain, to look for the little songbirds or the family of squirrels that I know live in the tree that branches over into our garden. But this particular morning nothing rustled any leaves. After the deer had made its abrupt exit the forest went quiet. After a few minutes, my gaze traveled upwards. That was the first time I noticed the mist. Of course it wasn’t the first time it was misty in the morning. But most of the time it hovered just above the fields and meadows. This time, it seemed stuck at the top of the trees. Like it hadn’t quite made its way down yet today. It somehow seemed thicker than usual. It looked like if I was able to reach out and touch it I would be met with something that would have more of a marshmallowy consistency. At the time it definitely captured my attention but it didn’t particularly strike me as *too* odd. \n\nSchnitzel let out a little bark. I guess I took a little too long staring at the canopy. He finished his snack and was sort of urging me to get going. So I tied my shoes and we made our way to the edge of the garden, through the little wooden gate. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I chuckled when my little sausage tried to get over a fallen tree but got stuck halfway for a few seconds. About an hour into the trail, the road becomes rougher as tree roots stick out of the ground and there is some elevation gain in some parts. Nothing me and Schnitzel can’t handle. From that point on there is a ditch on one side of the road. About half of the year it’s filled with water but at the moment it’s dry and overgrown with grass and other plants. At a certain point, you come across a willow tree that grows out of the ditch and arches over the path. Once you pass that tree you walk for about half an hour before connecting to a bike lane that runs through the forest. Following this hardened road for a bit and eventually the trail loops back around to our property. I need you to understand: I *know* every inch of that trail. We’ve been walking it pretty much every day for the last 5 years or so. Ever since we got Schnitzel, this has been my daily morning routine. I know every tree, every protruding root, every twist and turn in the road.. So it doesn’t make sense that people keep insisting I must have gotten lost, that day.\n\nAnyway, we were happily hiking along when suddenly I noticed the mist starting to descend from the canopy. It came down fast and it was incredibly thick. Not quite the marshmallow fluff I had previously expected but as I breathed it in, I could almost feel the weight of it in my lungs. I called Schnitzel over so I could turn on the little blinky light on his collar and tried to move on. You couldn’t see a meter in front of you, but looking at the ground you could still follow the trail. Schnitzel stayed close and when he ventured a few steps further his red blinker was visible enough to not lose sight of him. We continued our walk for a little while, hoping the mist would clear up. Unfortunately, it didn’t. It seemed like it grew thicker and thicker. I could taste it now. It was ashy but with an iron-like aftertaste. Very unpleasant. Schnitzel kept shaking his little head with his tongue sticking out so I think he tasted it as well. Scared I’d lose him in the fog, I put on his leash and slowly kept moving forward. \n\nI could feel it before I heard it. When I was younger I suffered from panic attacks. The feeling wasn’t unfamiliar. It begins at the bottom of your back and quickly shoots upwards towards the back of your head. Like a jolt of electricity. It surprised me. I hadn’t felt like that in years. Schnitzel made me snap out of it. He let out a little whimper. When I looked down he was glued to my leg, tail tucked tightly between his legs. Whatever it was, he felt it too, I thought. \n\nThen, out of the nothingness that had surrounded us, a growl. Not like any animal I have ever heard of. Besides, the forest wasn’t known to harbor bears and wolf sightings had been sporadic at best. But there it was again. It sounded closer. I got scared. The hairs on my arms stood up straight. My mouth felt dry. A painful tension grabbed me by the throat. What was it? What could possibly be growling like that? Was it coming for us? A loud cracking noise broke my thoughts. Was that a tree? It sounded like a tree just snapped in half?! I looked down. Schnitzel stood behind me, hiding behind my legs. He was scared too. The next growl send a shiver down my spine, it sounded like whatever it was stood right beside us. I picked up the dog and started running. I could feel something running behind us. It made the ground shake, sending a shockwave forward with every step it took. In the corner of my eye I could see the roots of the trees being expelled from the ground. As if grenades exploded underneath the ground. It was so hard to breathe, as the mist filled my lungs it seemed to collect at the bottom, almost pulling me down to the ground. My legs were about to give out. I squeezed Schnitzel for what I thought would be the last time. If this was it, if my legs were going to give out, I had to let him go so at least he would have a chance to get away from whatever was chasing us. Preparing to let go, I held my breath for a second. \n\n**The willow tree**!\n\nSomehow, through the thickness of the mist, I could make out its contours. A final fear-fueled adrenaline spike gave me the energy to take a few more steps. I ran as fast as I could and slid into the ditch, underneath the tree. Schnitzel was shivering, but luckily he stayed quiet. I tried to hold my breath but kept having to take huge gasps of air. The ground-trembling footsteps kept coming closer and closer. The growling grew more and more intense. It sounded so angry. I closed my eyes as the ground shook so violently I thought it was going to swallow us. Expecting teeth and claws to reach out from the fog, I bit my tongue to stop myself from screaming. \n\nInstead, the growling grew distant. The shaking was first reduced to a slight tremble before it stopped completely. Like it was being engulfed by the increasingly thickening mist. Then, silence. Absolute silence. You think you can imagine what that’s like, but I assure you, you can’t. The fog was now so thick I was choking on it. But what should have been a loud cough came out in complete silence. I looked down at Schnitzel. He was frantically barking in all directions, but he too was unable to produce a sound. I struggled to breathe, I was dizzy and my arms and legs felt heavy. I fainted. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes the fog was gone. The sound of birds and rustling leaves filled the air. **Schnitzel**! I was worried he would have run away after I passed out, but he was still beside me. He yawned and stretched as if he had just woken up from a nap. Perhaps he lost consciousness as well. What the hell happened? I tried to get my bearings, but the trail seemed different. Like a massive storm just passed through. Maybe it did, maybe that’s what happened.. Maybe we misinterpreted the wind's howling for some creature that chased us into a ditch. How long were we out? What if it was hours?! I worried about my husband. He works from home so he would have immediately noticed if I was late. I needed to get back, and tell everybody we were alright. \n\nI grabbed Schnitzel under my arm, the trail was so covered in bits of bushes and vines, you’d barely know there was a path there at all. We walked around like this for about an hour before I started to fear something was wrong. We should have reached the concrete bike lane by now. Where did it go?! Whatever storm passed over us couldn’t possibly have completely covered an entire road, could it have? I let myself fall to the ground, holding my head, trying not to panic. I couldn’t be lost, we walked in the right direction keeping the ditch to our left the entire time. Schnitzel was getting antsy, he kept nudging my pocket. I keep his treats in there. How long had it been since we ate? Not knowing what else to do, I decided to go back to where we came from. I figured I must have made a wrong turn somewhere and started following a different ditch or something. Another hour passed. I kept hoping we’d come across the willow tree we hid behind during.. whatever it was. But there was no willow to be found. Sure, there were plenty, but all were small and frail. Nothing like the big, sturdy one we walked passed évery morning for the last 5 years or so! Admittedly, I panicked. I started screaming at the trees, angry about their seemingly nonchalant attitude toward our predicament. Eventually, I calmed down when I noticed I was upsetting my dog. We sat there for about an hour. Just thinking about what to do. I hated myself for not taking my phone with me that day. My husband always gave me a hard time when I did that. But the battery hadn’t charged fully during the night and I absentmindedly plugged it in before we left, thinking it’d be done by the time we got back. If we get out of this, I thought, my phone will néver leave my side again. I gave Schnitzel the rest of his treats. There weren’t many left anyway. I had decided the best course of action would be to just pick a direction and start walking. Sooner or later, I reasoned, I would have to come across some recognizable structure. At the very least we’d run into one of the many trail indicators. It took us hours. Schnitzel was really struggling toward the end, but I couldn’t keep carrying him all the time. We both had no energy left. My feet were killing me. I had no idea what time it was, but considering how long we had been out here, surely it would get dark soon. I didn’t know what to do. We were exhausted. I let myself fall onto the ground. Schnitzel pretty much collapsed right beside me. I tried to comfort her the best I could by rubbing her little paws. You could tell they were sore from strutting around for what seemed like forever. I fought back the tears, trying to do the breathing exercises that I was thought to combat my anxiety attacks. \n\n*Look down - Breathe in for 4 seconds - Close your eyes - Hold your breath for 7 seconds while slowly raising your head until you’re looking up - Open your eyes - Breathe out for..* **A light!**\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I saw a light through the trees. A second ago I could barely put one foot in front of the other, but now I was running. I swooped up Schnitzel like he was made of feathers and ran as fast as I could toward the light. The closer I got the more I started to recognize the trail again. The path became more and more defined. I was home!\n\nThe little wooden gate at the end of our garden nearly flew out of its hinges when I bouldered my way through. During the final dash, I started to yell towards the house: ‘We’re fine! We’re here! We’re back!’ Hoping my husband was home and not out in the forest with a search party. I swung open the door, half expecting the full accompaniment of the police force! Or.. at least one cop or.. surely the forest ranger would be there, comforting my poor husband, distraught with grief. But all was quiet. I stood there, exhausted, covered in cuts and bruises from rummaging through the woods. My husband came out of his office. He yawned and scratched his head. Coffee in hand. Confused about why I kept yelling at the house that we’d returned. He looked at the state we were in and jokingly said ‘Djeezus hun, did you guys decide to *roll* through the forest today?’.\n\nSo here I am. \n\nMy husband took me to the doctor because I told him what happened to us. That we were gone for hours, maybe days depending on how long we were passed out. But he doesn’t believe me. Maybe.. Maybe I don’t believe it either. We were gone for about 2 hours, *he says*. No longer than usual. The only proof I have are my bruises. But everybody keeps reminding me that I’m clumsy and it wouldn’t be the first time I came close to falling in a ditch whilst being distracted by a bird or something. Schnitzel doesn’t want to follow the trail anymore. I keep telling everybody that that’s not normal. He loved our morning walks. He frolicked through the woods.. Ever since that foggy morning he’s reluctant to go into the forest with me.. I don’t know.. perhaps everybody is right, perhaps he’s just reacting to my anxiety.. Could I have imagined the whole thing? Did I really stumble down the ditch, hit my head and in a brief moment of confusion, conjured up this elaborate experience in my mind? \n\nThey want me to start taking my anti-anxiety meds again and try to forget the whole ordeal. Is that even possible? Can you just get over something like this? Maybe if I had some actual evidence of what happened to us.. I can’t stop thinking about going back out there. With my phone this time. Surely if I had my gps and I could just take a picture of what’s out there.. People would have to believe me, right? *If* there is something out there in the first place. But then, if there actually *is* something out there that growls and shakes the earth when it moves, surely I should not be chasing it, right?  ..*right*?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, as I walked out onto the porch, the mist was up in the tree canopy again.",

        "text": "First part: https://redd.it/11lv3qr\n\nOkay, everyone, it’s Kevin, thought I would do an update. Things have gotten a little weird. I guess I’ll go in order though. So I did stop by Champ’s after work on Wednesday night and went in to see Leah. I had a couple of beers and we chatted and I worked up the courage to ask her out. \n\nTo be honest, it was really hard for me, the whole time I was sitting there and chatting with her, I was thinking about Holly. Mostly the first time we met. We were both 18, just out of high-school and I got hired to work at a grocery store she was working at. They sent me to her checkout line on my very first day so she could train me.  We hit it off like crazy and just laughed and laughed. I thought she was so beautiful. We played what I call the question game, where we take turns answering questions, and then both answer. It’s just a good way to get to know someone. What’s your favorite band, movie, food, all that sort of stuff. \n\nShe was dating someone at the time though, he actually worked at the store too. I don’t know, I’m getting all off track. Anyway, so I drink my beers, and Leah chats with me when she’s not helping other patrons, and it was a Wednesday so it wasn’t exactly hopping, you know? Leah is twenty-five so a decent bit under my age, but she’s so cute and she seems interested in me so I just went for it. I asked her if she wanted to go out and she suggested the very next day since it’s one of her off days. So last night, we went to dinner.\n\nI’ll get to that, I’m trying to do this all in order.  I left the bar and went home and took a shower before standing in front of my mirror. The hair was there of course, and it seemed even longer than I had seen it up to that point. This was Wednesday night, so two nights ago. Cutting it just hasn’t been working so I decided to try to pull it out. It was long enough to wrap around my finger twice. I’m so sick of this little fucker. A month it’s been bothering me. Now it’s even worse. Okay, I keep jumping ahead.\n\nSo I wrap it around my finger and I can feel it pulsing like it does. Just throbbing. It’s honestly enough to make me wretch. It feels so strange, and the hair was… warm. No, not warm, hot.\n\nI get it wrapped and then I pull. I pull and it starts to move, and the pain is excruciating. Unbearable almost, I immediately stop. A small bit of blood pooled around the base of the hair and my flesh there was so sore. But the strangest thing was the hair itself hurt. When I pulled on it, it hurt. I don’t understand how hair can hurt. \n\nI didn’t know what to do. I tried again. I wrapped it around my finger and I braced myself and I pulled. The hair, my chest, everything erupted in pain, but I pulled. The hair grew by an inch. Then two. The pain though was unbearable, and I had to stop. I collapsed forward against my bathroom sink. I drew in great ragged gulps of air. I felt like I could collapse. The hair on my chest was pure agony, a pain that I felt in the core of my chest.\n\nI walked quickly to my bed and fell upon it. I must have fallen asleep, because I woke up Thursday morning, late for work. I don’t remember having any dreams. The hair was still there, of course, three and a half inches long I would guess. I went into the bathroom and got my small scissors meant for nails, and clipped the hair, crying out as a new wave of pain passed over me. The hair was so thick and long that it fell into the sink with an audible thump. I left it there.\n\nAfter work, I went home and showered, dismayed to see the hair was back, an inch or so long, and now coated in a fine reddish sheen. Blood. I almost felt as though I was making it angry by so many attempts to have it removed. I dressed for my date and went to pick Leah up.\n\nThe date was very nice. I had a good time, and when I dropped her back off she kissed me on the lips before getting out of my car. But as I drove home I erupted into tears. I had to pull over, I couldn’t even see. I thought about the first sort of date I had with Holly.\n\nI had actually been on a first date with this girl I had met through a common friend. It was a year or so after I had started at the grocery store. Holly and I both still worked there. She called me while I was on the date and when I saw it was her calling I excused myself and went outside to take her call. She was sobbing. She told me her boyfriend had been an asshole and she had broken up with him and he had pushed her down. Man, I hated him before and hearing that made my blood boil. She asked if I could come to pick her up and I told her yes. I went back in and told the girl I was on the date with that my grandmother was sick and I needed to go. I drove her quickly home and then went to get Holly.\n\nWe drove around for a bit and ended up at a playground. It was nearly ten, the park was technically closed. We got out and sat on the swings and talked. Then we kissed. Then we went back to her place. She still lived with her parents (I lived with my mom then, to be fair) so we snuck in quietly and went to her room. We made love, and it was amazing, and I knew I was going to marry her. \n\nGod, I can’t tell you how itchy and painful my chest is right now. The hair is growing, even without me tugging at it. I called off work today, the idea of wearing a shirt over the hair all day is one I can’t deal with right now.\n\nI suppose I should go to the doctor but I’m hesitant. I don’t know, what do you all think? Leah has already texted me since our date last night, she was wondering if I wanted to keep her company at the bar tonight. I might head there. Every time I get around her though I just think of Holly. You’d think plenty of time had passed and I could handle dating someone new but Holly was just so damn special, and she’ll always be a part of me. She’ll always be my wife. \n\nI have to get this damn thing out of my chest. God, it’s so itchy. Maybe I need to just pull and pull until it all comes out. The pain though. I don’t know, I’ll let you all know what I decide to do. One way or the other, I’m going to get this damn thing out of me, and soon!",

        "text": "He stabbed me through the chest. The prick.\n\nAs my corpse lay down on the ground, all I could think of was getting another can of pringles.\n\nI hated playing World of Warcraft sometimes, especially when some max level arsehole would stroll into the starter zones and starting ganking everybody.\n\nI know, I know: “Just log out and play an alt”.\n\nYeah, cool, but nah.\n\nI’m going to make the most of my subscription and I’m not gonna let some tool get in the way of my grind.\n\nMove my wisp from the graveyard and find a tree nearby my orc shaman’s corpse. And I’m watching his human fury warrior just camping at my corpse. As in he’s literally set up a campfire next to my corpse. Idiot’s just mocking me now.\n\nI get really well hidden behind the tree, click the ‘Resurrect Now’ button and…he charges and one shots me.\n\nShit.\n\nI’m at the graveyard again.\n\nWhatever. I don’t get rez sickness at low levels so I’ll just rez at the graveyard and avoid him. So I press the “Resurrect Now” button and…OUT OF NOWHERE the same warrior charges and one shots me.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nWhat a dick. Who gets off on this?\n\nObviously some loser. Now he’s- the warrior dancing on my grave. All I can see are BUR BUR BUR speech bubbles.\n\nScrew this.\n\nSo I got up and went into the kitchen. I was just me all by myself tonight. I know I should’ve been working on my college applications but I’ll do that later. Mom’s been hassling me about it for weeks but when both your parents are out for the night why would you waste your time writing college applications? That’s lame as.\n\nNow you’re probably thinking: Isn’t playing an MMO all by yourself lame instead? But I say to you: probably, maybe. I just really don’t want to write my applications right now.\n\nBut your future. What about your future? You are almost certainly saying. But you’re not my mother so get off my case.\n\nThe kitchen was pretty bare to be honest. Shopping’s supposed to be tomorrow but I thought there might be something in here at least. I was going for pringles but it looks like I already at the last of them a few hours ago. There wasn’t really anything in here.\n\nThere was still a loaf of bread. I could still have toast. It isn’t exactly everyone’s ideal night when their parents aren’t home, having toast for dessert I mean.\n\nOkay. I get it. I’m not the coolest person around. Other people might have parties, invite half the school, accidentally trash the house and get so drunk they hook up with the hot chick at school. Some people just don’t have exciting lives y’know?\n\nI heard the crash.\n\nThen my toast popped up.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\n\nI lived in a quiet neighbourhood and there never really any noise at night. But that sound just then, paralyzed me. I stood there dumb. I thought for a moment.\n\nIt was definitely inside the house right? I didn’t imagine it right? Or did I?\n\nDidn’t sound like a door. Or maybe it was? I looked at my phone: 9:15pm glared on the screen. It was still too early for mom and dad to be home, but it had to be.\n\nI called out, “Mom, dad? You home.”\n\nNo body responded.\n\nI left my phone in front of the toaster with my toast and wandered back into the living. From here I could see front alcove of the house but the light was left off just like I left it. Even the front porch light was off. They left before it was dark so I didn’t bother turning the porch light on.\n\nSo I go over and just as I flick the switch…\n\nCRASH!\n\nIt was from behind me. I stood and stared in the darkness. Nothing, silence, darkness.\n\nThis was starting to freak me out. There was no one here, no wind, nor rain, nor hail. I turned on the hallway lights and saw the stairs and the basement door.\n\nI don’t even know what the crash could’ve been, maybe it was from upstairs? A window perhaps. Yeah, probably a window. I’ll go look up stairs.\n\nMy feet trembled. I don’t know why. I ain’t scared or anything. Probably just a tree or something. Even though it sounded like it was from inside…\n\nThe hallway window. Fine. My bedroom. Fine. Parent’s bedroom. Fine. Bathroom. Okay.\n\nCRASH.\n\nIt was definitely from downstairs. The basement. It was from the basement.\n\nI was probably being robbed. Bullshit. That’s just me acting up. There’s no way I’m being robbed. Wouldn’t they come through the backdoor anyway? I shook my head. I really had to stop being a pussy.\n\nI swaggered, I didn’t just walk, I swaggered downstairs. Proving to absolutely no one that I wasn’t scared being by myself. I’m going to college next year, how could I be scared of sounds coming from the basement. Sounds like the most cliché shit ever.\n\nI put my hand on the doorknob and held my breath. If there was someone down there, what was I even going to do? Fight them. That was so stupid it couldn’t possibly happen.\n\nI stared at my fingers holding the door knob. My fingers were white, strained, and shaking. This was stupid, I said to myself and with a deep breath I swung open the door.\n\nNothing happened. I stared into pitch black darkness.\n\nI’m such an idiot sometimes. There’s nothing in here.\n\nI turned on the light.\n\nThere, in the middle of the basement floor, was some guy in a football helmet wielding two axes. He turned and stared at the top of the stairs.\n\nI was fucked.\n\nMy legs ran, almost automatically, and I headed…up the stairs.\n\nI still don’t know what I was thinking. I just panicked. But when I was halfway up the stairs I saw this, this…beserker, burst out of the basement and slam into the wall. I didn’t look for long, I turned right at the top of the stairs, opened the door to my bedroom, ran in, and hid under the bed.\n\nI heard nothing for a while. I thought the coast was clear.\n\nI wanted to scream out to the neighbourhood, wake everyone up and get someone to call the police. I almost knew, as soon as I opened my mouth that jock beserker would burst in and hack me to pieces.\n\nCalling out was not an option.\n\nMy phone. I instinctively reached into my pocket for my phone and panicked. As if I already hadn’t done enough panicking. I left my one ticket out of here by the toaster downstairs.\n\nThe only way to my phone was probably meeting and being hacked to death by the quarterback of home invaders. That was out of the question.\n\nThe only way out was through the second story window, it may leave me vulnerable for a minute as I go through, not to mention it’s not the safest of landings. But before I could roll out from under the bed, I heard the loud thud of his footsteps going up the stairs. He stopped at the top with almost a stomp. I froze.\n\nI shouldn’t have been so shit-scared but I was. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t make a sound. I couldn’t do anything without that psycho finding out where I was and hacking me to death.\n\nThen I heard a dial. My phone was dialling. It stopped.\n\n“Hello? Darling? Why you calling?”\n\nThat bastard had my phone and rang my mum. He slowly stepped towards and stopped in front of my bedroom door. I could see the soles of his boots underneath the door frame, the light from the hallway seeping under the door.\n\n“Hey there maam.”\n\n“Hello? Who is this?”\n\n“I’m just the warrior about to hack your son to death.”\n\nHe dropped the phone. My mom on loudspeaker kept saying hello. I panicked. I sprang from under the bed and thrust open the window. Just as fast, beserker axe quarterback kicked down my bedroom door. Adrenaline pumping, I was faster, I dived, straight up dived through my window. He threw an axe at my foot and just missed, embedding the hatchet on the sill.\n\nI fell on the bushes below, exploding off once I landed and bolted out across the street.\n\nI screamed. Oh did I scream. \n\n“Fucking help me. He’s going to kill me!”\n\nLight after light in house after house turned on. I ran down the street, not looking back until I reached the curb.\n\nAn old man was in the front lawn and watched me as I ran for dear life.\n\n“Son, what are ya hollering about.”\n\n“The police,” I said gasping for breath. “Call the police.”\n\nThe police, sirens blazing, came ten minutes later. There was no sign of forced entry. There was no damage anywhere. They found my phone next to the uneaten, cold toast.\n\nNo one saw anyone fitting my description in the neighbourhood that night. When he heard me screaming, the gun nut across the road from me sat on his front lawn with his AR-15 but, to his disappointment, saw no one leave the house.\n\nThe police were nice about it, my parents believed me, but I got the nickname “Scream Queen” at school about it. Said Chucky the starting quarterback was gonna kill me. I just ignore them. I won’t see any of those idiots in a year anyway. I know what happened to me.\n\nI didn’t log in to WoW for a few days. I know, I know I made a whole stink about getting the most of my subscription earlier but getting attacked by an axe wielding maniac in real life sort of dampens the fun you know?\n\nI didn’t know what to think. When I logged back on with Orc Shaman, there was that same human fury warrior, from days earlier. Waiting for me. And he ganked me.",

        "text": "   \n*Darkness.* The only sight visible as my eyes opened and were met with the sheer black that now surrounded me. The skin on my forearm burned with a numbing cold pain and was unnaturally hot and clammy to the touch. I coughed with an ache in my chest at the harsh breath that filled my lungs. A grim and painful silence was all I heard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe taste on the tip of my tongue and lips was copper and ash. My nostrils filled with a burning sensation, followed by a smell of sweet rot. A pulsating feeling overtook my senses as my ears picked up a droning sound in the distance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself to be stuck, unable to move forward toward the sound. It could have only been a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity. Slowly, I put one foot down, followed by the other, and walked a distance that I will never be able to comprehend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSweat fell into my eyes, followed by a burning sting. I tried to blink away the pain but was rewarded with an equally uncomfortable dryness. I could feel my pupils dilate as the light overtook me, sending a harsh pulsing pain to the back of my head.  The pain was blinding, yet I still felt a great relief overtake me as I could see again, even if I was still in horrible pain with the worst migraine I have ever had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe relief was short-lived as I looked upon my surroundings. I saw nothing that seemed even a little bit familiar, gray stone walls covered in moisture that seemed to ooze out of the walls. The floor was covered in ash that stuck to my feet and stirred up as I walked. Blood-covered areas of the wall caught my attention, and I focused on them and recognized hand prints. I shivered in fear as I walked on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed the walls, passing pools of blood on the floor. The horrid smell of copper overwhelmed me as I began to walk at a brisk pace, my breath quickening. That was until I nearly ran into a great wooden door. The wood that made up this door was dark and smelled of rotting oak, bound together with rust-covered iron. A cloud of dust hung in the air and seemed to surround the door as if it was shrouded in mist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter taking in the sight of this massive door, I took several steps towards it. A piercing scream caused my ears to ring out, and my whole body began to shake as I fell to the floor. An immeasurable pain overtook me as if to torture me with this noise. The sound was that of several people screaming directly into my ear, and it echoed within my brain. Building pressure within my skull until my eyes began to water. I cried out in pain with a scream of my own, to try and release some of the built-up pressure before my skull cracked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs quickly as it came, the scream dissipated, although the ringing in my head remained. I wiped tears from my eyes and steadied my breath as I slowly rose to my feet. After regaining what little composure I could, I made my way toward the great wooden door yet again. A sound that will now forever haunt my dreams, an immense and dreadful *grinding*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused with trepidation as I reached for the handle. How did I get here? What will I find here? Why was I sent here? And most importantly, where the hell was I? I took a deep breath as I tried to prepare myself for anything. I was, however, severely unprepared for what I was about to see as I slowly pulled open the door with an intense creak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a step back as my eyes beheld a seemingly infinite chamber covered in gore, that was dripping down the sides of it. This chamber seemed to go on up forever, into an untold darkness that seemed to swallow it whole. For a moment, I found myself to be lost in the darkness as if it was pulling me towards it. I was able to break my fixation as I focused my attention back on what was at the center of this horrid chamber.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the center of this hellish chamber, was an immense machine of agony. It was made from gears, pulleys, and belts, held together by rusty blood-stained iron. The machine continuously ground and pulsed. It was running at a speed that seemed both archaically slow and impossibly fast. I could feel the rumbling of this horrific machine deep inside my chest. My eyes watered in fear as I looked the machine up and down, taking in its crude build. I could smell a putrid stench I was unable to identify. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs my eyes focused back on the area in front of me, I was met with the crippling gaze of a horrible creature. This beast in front of me was gaunt, and its skin was a shade of lifeless gray. It turned its head towards me, and its mouth formed into a smile. The smile, however, was not warm or inviting. It held a horror behind it, unlike anything I had ever experienced and it held a deep lust in its eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds of screaming broke me free from its gaze, and I looked to see several similar creatures who were dragging a man behind them. This man screamed, and he begged as the ones carrying him turned to me. Stretched across their faces were smiles that held untold horrors behind them, and in their eyes, I saw all-consuming greed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at the man they dragged behind them, his voice was hoarse and his skin was bloodied. He shouted to the creatures that held him with confusion in his voice,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"I followed the word, and all that was taught to me!\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was when I noticed he had a blood-soaked cross hanging from his neck. His despair turned into hateful anger, as he spewed wishes of death towards the ones he had followed. He spoke of his parents, how they raised him with discipline and stole away his zest for life. He spat as he spoke of the priests who told him how to live his life, how to judge others, and how to hate his fellow man for following their hearts. After being surrounded by such hate his whole life, it now fully engulfed him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was shocked to witness a man of faith be so filled with hate. I was unsure what fate awaited him. The creatures dragged the man up the lower part of the machine. Smoke spewed from the insides as the gears turned faster. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe creatures all turned and looked back at me as they began to feed the once-screaming man into the gears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man did not beg, and he no longer pleaded; he only began to maniacally laugh as his whole body slowly was pulled into the shredding gears. His insides spilled out and his blood sprayed my face as the gears went to work, crushing his body. Skin, bone, and muscle all tore and ground as if being devoured by a starving animal. Until only a part of his face and a single eye remained trapped within the gears of the machine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend, what took place next, is why I have written this account. For it's a horrible memory I cannot bear to keep within anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man, who was now minced by the gears of this great machine turned his eye and looked at me. He blinked, only once then narrowed his eye. What remained of his mouth, formed into a wicked smile that burned itself into my very soul. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI jarred myself awake and quickly grabbed the trash can just beside my bed. I was sick for a few minutes, as what I had seen would cause me to be ill for days. I sprung out of bed, ran to my washroom, and threw cold water on my face. In an attempt to calm myself, and rinse away the bile on my lips and sweat from my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe nightmare, or what I was sure must have been one, was over. I took several deep breaths and found my lungs were not painful or heavy. My skin was not hot, and I no longer smelled sweet rot. However, I could still hear the droning and the grinding of that horrible and immense machine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I began to whimper as I felt a tear roll down my cheek. For the reflection of that ungodly smile looked back at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n….\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Hell is but a great machine, believe me, I've seen it. Ever turning, forever tormenting the souls of those whose life actions cursed them with an eternity in this place. A machine manned by the most horrific creatures, whose only lust in life is to cause untold suffering to the ones enslaved by the faceless monstrosity of this ghastly machine.*",

        "text": "As a child, I'd call it the Flicker. There's one in all of us, glowing and glimmering in the most beautiful way. No two are exactly the same; Each is unique to the person. They move like fire and shine like stars. I can recognise someone before they even enter the room, as I see their energy dancing through the walls.\n\nThe only person I ever spoke to about this was my grandpa. I'd see him every day after school, since my mother would still be at work. We'd talk for hours about everything, but I'd often bring the conversation back to the Flickers. It never confused him, we just spoke about it like it was normal. He would smile and listen to my stories, and I'd smile whilst telling them. I loved the way he would ask me questions and show a genuine interest - I always looked forward to finishing school so that I could see him.\n\nSomething my grandpa was known for was giving advice you didn't ask for; You always needed it, though, even if you didn't realise it. There's one particular piece of advice that has always stuck with me...\n\n\"Stay clear of graveyards. A soul of the dead was left here for a reason.\"\n\nHe always believed that the Flickers were souls, although I never thought the same until recently. I reminded him that I had only seen the Flicker inside of living people, but he already knew; He told me that I should be prepared for if things ever change. I loved him so much, he always thought about how things change, and always had a plan for if they did. I miss him.\n\nI was there when he passed away last month. He had been sick for a few weeks, going in and out of the hospital. But he never let it change him. Right until the last day, he was always his usual self - Making us laugh, talking non-stop, and giving advice. He had a wisdom-esque charm about him, like he always knew more than you realised. His gift was being able to prepare anyone for anything, the one thing he could prepare nobody for was his death.\n\nWe all knew it would happen eventually, and we were by his side when it did. He didn't say much in his final few hours, but right before he closed his eyes for the final time, he looked at me with confidence. It was as if he wanted to pass his confidence onto me before going. The hardest part, and the part that cemented my belief in the Flickers being souls, was watching his disappear. It didn't happen fast - This was not akin to a candle being blown out. It shrunk slowly as it got faintly dimmer by the second. It was like a flame burning to the end of its wick, finishing a life fully lived. It was about the only thing that gave me comfort at that time, knowing that his fire burnt out rather than being extinguished.\n\nOver the past month, my connection to the Flickers has diminished. It happened slowly at first - I would notice them getting fainter every day. Yesterday, I looked in the mirror and saw no Flicker at all. No flame through the walls, no glowing on the streets. I could no longer see them, I could no longer feel them. I felt lonely, as if I could no longer truly connect with anyone. Nobody even knew it, but I was going through another loss.\n\nI did something I thought I would never do - I visited a graveyard. I had to see my grandpa's grave. I made my way down that night. It was completely empty, not a person in sight. I'm not just saying that because I couldn't see any souls; I thought that was the case, too. But then I had a proper look, and I truly was alone. As I approached my grandpa's grave, I looked longingly at the stone and the dirt. It was hard to believe he was really gone.\n\n\"Hey. The Flickers are all gone. I can't see them anymore.\"\n\nI paused, as if waiting for a response.\n\nNone came.\n\n\"I don't know what it means, but I wanted you to know.\"\n\nI paused again.\n\n\"It happened around the time you... Around the time you left. I wanted to -- Oh, god\", my speech broke as I started to tear up. I didn't know what I was doing there, and I felt like going had been a stupid idea.\n\nJust then, as my silent cry grew into a loud one, I noticed a faint glowing in the ground of a nearby grave.\n\nThen two.\n\nThen four.\n\nThen more.\n\nThe dirt all began to light up with Flickers beneath. Many graves remained dark, my grandpa's included. Yet many were shining bright.\n\nThe Flickers floated gently into the air, eye-level with me. There were easily a hundred of them, probably more. Each began to circle around me. Their gentle glows were so beautiful, and I felt that they could sense my connection; They knew I could see them. They shone differently to living souls, slightly darker. Their flames flickered and danced more than I was used to.\n\nI should have listened to my grandpa, but I realised it all too late. My eyes were too busy watching their movements to realise that a Flicker had moved into my head from behind. I noticed my mind become fuzzy, as if I could hear the soul's own thoughts.\n\n\"We...Made...Your...Grandpa...Sick.\"\n\nThe sentence was so disgusting I almost couldn't process it at first.\n\n\"We...Can do...The same...To you.\"\n\nI fell to the floor, causing the Flicker to leave my head. I could think clearly again, and I noticed they had all stopped moving. They were just waiting to find out what I would do. Whilst linked with that Flicker, I could almost feel their wants and motives. They wanted to control my body, to use me. I don't know what for, but I could feel that they wanted my mind empty to use it for themselves. I was just a vessel for them to get control of - Is this why they killed my grandpa? To have access to a vacant body?\n\nI ran away, leaving the graveyard behind. They didn't seem to follow me - I can only assume that they have to stay close to their physical body. I passed a few people as I ran through the streets, each still without a Flicker. I could not see living Flickers anymore, only those of the dead. I'm so used to identifying people by their souls that I almost bumped into people several times.\n\nI couldn't go home after that. I needed to sit with someone I trusted, so I went to my mother's place. My plan was to gently open up to her about my ability and tell her everything. Once I got there, I knocked on the door... But in all the panic, it took me a moment to notice that I could see a Flicker through the wall. It came closer as I heard the lock turn, and watched the door open.\n\nMy mother was standing there, the glow coming from within her.\n\nShe spoke,\n\n\"Didn't we tell you what we can do to you?\"\n\nWe stared at each other expectantly. They were waiting for my reaction, but I didn't have one. I was frozen, locked up with fear, unable to react.\n\n\"Your mother was kind enough to drop by her dad's grave earlier. Isn't that nice?\"\n\nI let my anger show through my fear. \"Get out. NOW.\"\n\nAs my passion for protecting my mother rose, I noticed a second glow inside of her. Looking down, my own Flicker had also returned. I could see them through all the houses on the street. These were living Flickers, they shone like stars.\n\nI stared at my mother's. It was as bright as always, yet ever so small. The Flicker of the dead was seemingly extinguishing what was left of my mother. I felt a burning deep inside of me, noticing my own flame larger than ever. I watched as it slowly left my body, and grew closer to my mother's soul. They danced and intertwined, sharing their strength; Igniting each other. Her fire grew stronger until it had fully engulfed the dead Flicker possessing her.\n\nShe collapsed to the floor as my own soul returned to me. I could see clearly that the soul inside of her was once again her own. Her own flicker, shining bright, told me that she was alive.\n\nI got her into bed, and sat downstairs.\n\nI questioned to myself whether my ability is a gift or a curse.\n\nAll I knew is that I wanted to ask my grandpa.\n\nHe would know what to do.\n\nJust then, my phone rang.\n\n\"Grandpa\"\n\n[===](https://reddit.com/r/BriteWrites)",

        "text": "Hello is late at night and I’ll try to make this short I just want to get it out of my chest. I’m 28 (F) and my husband 35 (M) are expecting our third baby. We had decided not to get pregnant again and he was going to get a vasectomy but before that I found out I was pregnant and at first I was nervous but we were both excited about it and our kids too. Now to the main topic I am a Christian and I been Christian for a long time not always attending church but I’ve been trying and I feel like I been nice and respectful to the people in my church. I need to give some background for you to understand and it might look mess up my writing but I’ll try to explain as best as I can. I met this person let’s call her maga and her family when I was 16 year old and they were the ones that introduce me to Christianity because I was a catholic. I convert and it look like everything was fine they were nice and I though of her as a friend then she started some kind of rivalry with me that she started doing thing behind my back for example tell all the people at church that I was selling my body for money or clothes or shoes because at that time I didn’t had church clothes my mom every paycheck she would buy me either clothes or shoes for church beacause I was q good daughter she will work and me and my sis will watch my younger brother, clean the house and even cook.anyway people at church started talking and having a wrong impression of me and I started losing faith and I would not attend church as much as I did back then. I try but it became even harder for me. Now to the main topic I am pregnant almost six months and maga is pregnant with my ex boyfriends child ( I didn’t mention she ended up marrying my ex boyfriend) and she is 7 month old. I am a stay home mom and I try my best to go to church but we only have one car and my husband takes it to work so sometimes I can’t go to church. Maybe is my hormones or something because I have always seen how the peolple at church see her as an angel that can’t do no wrong and I also see how everyone is excited about her pregnancy and nobody acknowledge mind like they don’t care. I sometimes get a bit hormonal because I see everyone asking her about her pregnancy and helping her and I feel abandoned like I’m part of the church too but nobody care about me! Maybe I’m over reacting. I sometimes cry myself to sleep because of this can i get an advice?\n\nEdit: I’m a stay home mom with two girls and a baby boy on the way. I don’t have family here where I live beside my parent and sister and I take care of my mom because she is disable. I also used to be a happy person with little to none social anxiety but after she started spreading those rumor about me I became extremely antisocial only have one friend and is hard for me to open up to people my husband is one of the few I open up.",

        "text": "My name is unimportant, the circumstances of my story are the only things of any great value left to speak of, in what's left of my life. I am currently living on death row in one of the many maximum security installations here in the states. I am using my last session within the law library here to submit this story as a cautionary tale to the whole of humanity. As a warning, that your time on this earth may be just as short and fleeting as my own. It's less than 48 hours now from the moment I get to meet my maker, so to speak, or so some tell me anyway. I'm a bit skeptical about meeting anyone at all after they slip that needle in my arm. But I guess ya never know until ya know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey refer to the last walk to the death chamber, as \"The Mile\", in most facilities, though it is quite a bit short of being a mile at all. For some reason the name has stuck over the years, and that mile is a walk I will have to take in a short time, and deservingly so. To tell the story of why I found myself in the situation that I have, I must first tell you the story of another. The story of a sacrifice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir name is again, unimportant, but their actions led to an unfathomable amount of violence and evil. A woman and a man in love can be a beautiful thing, a romance can shine a light on some of life's most beautiful attributes. But a love between the right, or wrong pair, depending on how you see it, can lead to things you can't even possibly imagine. This story is a love story, and a horror story. The pair met at a small get together for friends and classmates of a particular school. And they pretty much hit it off right away, though it was what appeared to be the beginnings of any other relationship before it, it was actually the beginnings of a terrible set of events set in motion at that very get together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey began their courtship as many others, going out to movies, dinners, and to anyone looking in from the outside they were nothing to pay any attention to. But for me I knew the woman in this pairing rather well, and to say she had some obscure and disturbing interests would be saying it extremely lightly. She was into anything occult related and her ability to manipulate a man was unbelievable. From nearly the start of this relationship she had him wrapped around all ten of her fingers. Her beauty was a thing of legend in a town full of rather ordinary looking folks, he would do anything to keep her heart and her attention. And she was more than willing to test this fact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first it was one small ritualistic act leading to another, from cutting and blood related fetish performances, to the killing of a small helpless animal of some kind or another. But before it was over I had discovered through the running of his loose lips, that she had planned to summon some kind of ancient entity, and to do so she intended to sacrifice an innocent child in the name of this being. He who shall not be named, he said to me. And he said he didn't want to but he didn't know how to get out of it if she really decided to go forward with this sick and twisted plan. That he loved her with everything he was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately the day came, when she wanted to do this horrible thing, and she entrusted him with the acquisition of the child needed to perform the act. And because he couldn't fathom abducting someone else's child from a mall parking lot or school function somewhere, he did something far far worse than that. He had his ex-wife bring his own daughter over for the weekend. The authorities got involved after the weekend was over and done with, and the mother had come for her daughter only to be told she had run away and he had been looking for her desperately. Many questions were brought forth about why he hadn't contacted the police in this matter, and so on, but for the most part until any evidence was unearthed they had little to go on, just a reported runaway, and because I had knowledge to the contrary I made a decision I can never take back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited for night to fall, it was a crisp cold night, and you could see your breathe when you exhaled, I can remember it all so vividly. I waited until almost four in the morning when I thought they would all be fast asleep. I made my way into the residence through the front door with a key I knew was kept under a medium sized stone out front of their house in a little garden patch. At first I thought for sure I had been correct and that the occupants were all asleep, but I was dead wrong. As I made my way to the very back of the house to a spare bedroom there, I could hear the sounds coming from inside the room through the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was painfully obvious they were having sex in that room, the sounds were a dead give away to that fact, I steadied myself, and calmed my breathing. I took in a deep breath and raised the roofing hammer I had brought along from my toolbox at home, and I turned the door knob. When I opened the door I saw four people in the room, not the two I had originally expected, they had company. But that did not deter me, for evil was to be slain this night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know until afterward how much energy you really had to expend to beat someone to death, even with a 32 ounce hammer in your hand. The court records would go on to prove that I hit her and her lover a total of 63 times combined, I still remember the way her head came apart, I still have nightmares of it even to this day. I had never seen brains like that before. I spent a lot less energy on their two companions, though I did hit them more than a dozen times each as well. The murders were so horrific in fact that I was told many of the investigators working the case, were physically ill after having witnessed my work. And as bad as I felt for them all, I felt nothing for the evil people I had slain. This lack of remorse would make it quite easy for the prosecution to convict with a death penalty ruling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe true horror came during the trial though, on the eve that I was to be convicted, I would see the ex-wife enter the courtroom of the man I had beaten to death. And with her was a young girl, the same young girl that I know for a fact was killed by the same group of people I had murdered. I know they killed her, and I know they did grotesque and perverted things to her after the fact. The horror and evil that little girl encountered at the hands of her own father, someone she thought she was safe with and loved by, was just unfathomable. He told me himself what occurred that night, and how bad he felt about it, he even asked me what he should do now, if I thought he would go to hell for what he had done, or if I even believed in such things. I think back on it, and I believe he may have been sharing things with me in the hopes that I might stop it for him somehow. But I just don't know honestly it is hard to say. In the end though I put a stop to it all, forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I tell you all now, and do not take this lightly, I am going to die for what I did, but I didn't stop the evil at all, only those who brought it forth into our world. So I will die for nothing, for I have in no way accomplished what I intended to. I say to you now, that young girl, is not the girl she once was, I believe within her lies the entity they called forth. And some day, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, she will bring upon the earth an unspeakable evil. And if what I have read into is true, no human on the face of the globe will be spared of it. They may very well have killed us all, if the entity inside her truly is the chaos itself, then god help us all if there is a one, because we are definitely going to need one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am working on a plan to escape from this hell hole of a prison, because I am the only one alive who truly knows what is at stake. The dangers in letting that little creature of a girl live on, for there is no telling when it will act. I must do something, I must stop her before it is too late, or impossible to do so. Hell for all I know it is already an impossibility, she may be too powerful already to stop. The die may be cast as they say. But I have to try if I can, I have to do something if at all possible. I just have to get out of here first, and maybe just maybe I will be able to save you all, myself, maybe even the world. Though I highly doubt I will get out of this situation with my life no matter how it plays out. My life though is not important, only the future of humanity, and it's existence in this beautiful world. I cannot allow those evil people, and their little monster to be the end of everything, the end of us all. I hope for all our sakes, or at least all of yours, that I get the chance to stop it, before it is inevitably too late.",

        "text": "i (14, male) live in a house in a peaceful village around central england. I get on quite well with my parents and sister and i am comfortable telling them things and they always believe me. About just over 2 years ago in lockdown i had a falling out with my parents about my school work and which they took my phone off me.\n\nThey decided we were going out as a family for a big walk taking my dog with them and also my sister, I declined as i was still mad about the argument. My dad tells my mum not to bother convincing me to join them so they took off. I was home alone with nothing too do and decided to kill time playing on my piano as i had learnt how to play previously in primary school. As i’m playing i suddenly get up to go get a drink from the kitchen, my house at this time was small and you could hear sounds pretty much anywhere you were in the house despite which room you were standing in, anyway i hear my parents glass door wardrobe slide open and it had a very distinctive whirring sound. It startled me obviously and as i went upstairs slowly to check what it was the doors slammed, glass shattering everywhere, i had no other thought then to run away downstairs and hide.\n\nHowever, as i bolted down the stairs my parents room can be seen clearly from the stairs and i saw what looked to be a horrifyingly abnormal figure standing in their bedroom doorway. Now i myself had always told my friends i thought the paranormal and supernatural were not real and i thought it was all some sort of conspiracy theory, but this had changed my thought so quickly it had made me feel no way i’ve ever felt before. I ran downstairs in desperation and hid in my downstairs bathroom. Throughout my time hiding i heard occasional tapping on the door, each time holding my breath i thought it would be my last. Every footstep i heard almost echoed throughout my body as my heart was booming like punches being thrown.\n\nI waited for around an hour until my parents returned and i was grounded for 3 weeks. I told them i saw the figure and it was whistling but they told me there’s no point in trying to blame it on something fake. Every night i hear that same whistle from my attic and it makes me think back to that time all that had happened. My parents installed the new variants of the Alexa with the cameras on and whatever they see they just say , “a window must’ve been open” or “things move by themselves all the time dont be silly”. I’m the friend who walks every one home at night as i’m the strongest out of us all (boys and girls). I see glimpses of that same figure and i still hear that noise.",

        "text": " My husband was able to fulfill his dream, living in a house in the middle of the woods. At first I was against it, I didn't want to drive for an hour every time I wanted to buy something or get together with friends. I changed my mind after I started working online. I was home all day working, but almost every day someone would come up and interrupt me.\n\n\"You're not even working, you're on the computer.\"\n\n“Your work is online, you can do it later.”\n\nBesides getting deeply irritated, I never said anything because I hate conflict.\n\n“Come in, we can gossip all day.” - I always said, smile on my face, but in reality, holding myself from punching the person.\n\nAs the expert conflict solver that I am, I moved to the middle of the woods because I didn't know how to say “no”.\n\nMy husband seemed to be in paradise:\n\n“Feel the fresh air, the sounds of the forest, this place is wonderful.”\n\nI only noticed the endless insects and the deafening noise of the forest at night. At least the air really was nice.\n\nOur daughter, Sara, was five years old, my husband dropped her off at day care every morning and brought her home shortly after noon. I wondered how that would work in the long run; when she got older she would hate having to spend almost 2 hours every day on a means of transport just to get to school. Anyway, that's a problem for my future self, for now she was an adorable and obedient child who never gave us any problems.\n\nAfter a week of living there, Sara started to act strangely. I would hear her talking to the window, and when I entered the room she would stop abruptly and look at me, smiling.\n\n\\-Who were you talking to?\n\n\\-Nobody, Mom.\n\nAfter a month Sara started asking strange questions.\n\n\\-Mom, do I have a sister?\n\n\\-No, you are an only child.\n\n\\-Oh, there's a girl just like me at my bedroom window.\n\n\\-Just like you? This is called reflection, my love.\n\n\\-Refeton?\n\n\\-Reflection, like in mirrors.\n\nI picked her up and carried her to the bathroom mirror.\n\n\\-See? That's our reflection, not another person.\n\n\\-No mom, a girl like me in the backyard, at the window.\n\nI concluded that Sara had created an imaginary friend.\n\n\\-A friend visits you every day at the window? That´s nice baby, but she's not your sister, just a friend, even if she looks a lot like you.\n\n\\-Alright, mom.\n\nSara gave me a hug and went back to playing.\n\nWhen my husband got home, I told him about our daughter's imaginary friend, arguing that maybe it wasn't ideal for her to grow up without interacting with anyone. He replied that it was silly of me, she interacted with other children in the nursery and that was enough.\n\nSara talked to herself more and more often. One day, I could have sworn I saw a child, curly hair just like Sara's, run out of the window as soon as I entered the room.\n\n\\-\n\nThe days were pleasant, I spent the nights reading books and watching series. On Saturdays, we drove into town to hang out with our friends, and it was enough social interaction to sate my craving for small talk until the following week.\n\nI was a little worried about the forest, the environment could be dangerous for a 5 year old girl, so I kept an eye on Sara all day long. When I couldn't observe her directly, I would lock her in her room, turn on the baby monitor and check on her every half hour. The other day, I locked her in her room, leaving her with a children's show about dinosaurs and cows being best friends. Don't even ask, after watching a few hundred children's shows with my daughter, I'm sure the writers of those shows use heavy hallucinogens before work.\n\nTo my surprise, after I sat down on the laptop to work, I saw my daughter running around the backyard. I immediately opened the window and yelled at her:\n\n\\-Sara, how did you get out of your room? You cannot go into the yard without my permission.\n\nShe pretended she didn't hear me and ran into the middle of the forest. I got desperate and quickly put on my sneakers to run after her, when I heard Sara laughing in the bedroom. I unlocked the door and she was there, still watching the children's show.\n\n\\-Sara, did you leave the room?\n\nShe made an expression of disbelief, as if she didn't understand the reason for my question.\n\n\\-Never mind, if you need me, call me right away.\n\nThere was no way Sara could have left the room, the door and window were locked; much less come back from the woods so quickly. I must have seen things.\n\nThe following week, on a sunny day, I let Sara play in the backyard, and I watched her through the window as she played. If she tried to get out of my line of sight, I immediately asked her to come back. However, a few minutes later, while looking at the window, I felt shivers down my spine to the bizarre scenario that I was looking at. There were two Saras playing in the backyard, a few feet away from me.\n\n\\-Honey? Come here right now. – I yelled as I recovered a bit.\n\nThe two started running towards me. However, only one of them entered, the other one stood in the doorway, smiling and looking at me without blinking. She was identical to my daughter, but she didn't look human, she looked like an android trying to imitate a child.\n\n\\- Mom, may I come in? - The little girl standing in the doorway asked.\n\n\\-Who are you? – I asked.\n\n\\-May I come in? – The entity that imitated my daughter asked again.\n\n\\-Are you the daughter of someone in the neighborhood? – I asked, trying to rationalize what was happening, even knowing that a 5-year-old wouldn't have walked alone for almost 1km, which was the distance from our house to the nearest one.\n\n\\- Someone daughter, may I come in?\n\nI slammed the door in the child's face, and closed all the curtains in the house. As I looked out a window, I watched the little girl stand still for minutes, staring at the door, not moving a muscle. After a while, she put both hands on the ground and ran towards the forest, galloping like a horse. I closed the last curtain and waited for nightfall. As soon as my husband arrived, I explained what had happened and said I was leaving that place immediately. He even tried to argue, said I was making excuses because I didn't want to live there. I realized that it was useless trying to talk to him, he simply would not believe me. I took Sara, filled two suitcases and went to my mother's house.\n\nWhen I got there, I explained to my mother what had happened. She was surprised, but said that I could stay there as long as I wanted. After dinner, I decided to call my husband.\n\n\\-Hey.\n\n\\-Hi love, why are you calling me from inside the house?\n\n\\-What do you mean? I 'm at my mother's.\n\n\\-It's not funny, you kept knocking on the door and when I opened it you kept asking “may I come in, may I come in?” non stop, refusing to talk to me, you didn´t even call me when you left Sara at your mother´s house.\n\n\\-Listen carefully to what I 'm saying. Get out of this house now, don't take anything, just leave.\n\n\\-What are you talking about? This is stupid. I don't know why I 'm talking on the phone if you're here. Wait, how are you talking without hol...\n\nI heard sounds of crashing, fighting and tearing flesh, along with screams and then gasps that got lower and lower in volume until everything was silent. After a few seconds I heard footsteps and someone picking up the phone from the floor. In a cheerful and jovial tone, a voice identical to my husband's said:\n\n\\-Hi love! Mother's house, knocking on the door. May I come in?\n\n[X](https://www.wattpad.com/1322961189-a-doorway-to-hell-chapter-1)",

        "text": "So in January, I bought my first apartment it was a standard one-bedroom pet-friendly place.  The neighbors were friendly some were too nice, but to be fair I have a wonderful thing called \\*generalized anxiety\\*, so I chalked it up to that. I, and my two cats, lived on the second floor with a window facing the back parking lot, the layout was simple you walk into the kitchen that turns into a living room, and there's a closet by the door that I used as a pantry, and between the kitchen and living room you can turn right to see an entry into my bedroom and if you walk in there's another closet to the right and a bit to the left on the same wall there is the bathroom door hopefully I explained it well enough. It wasn't in the best part of town but not the worst, I tried not to go out at night but my job doesn’t have very flexible hours (I'm a mortician and we are understaffed so I have to take extra jobs around, I don’t mind though I like helping people even if they are dead) so about once a week I have to come home at night.  I try not to worry about anything since I am a taller dude with some muscle but to be safe I bring a knife with me (I could, and maybe should've, bought a gun since I’m in America but I don’t trust myself with it, especially now that I’m on edge) every time I go out but thankfully nothing bad happened so I didn’t need to use the knife!\n\nEverything was going fine I got used to my overly friendly neighbors and was pretty sure I saw everyone there. I was there for maybe two weeks when I walked into the lobby, after an absurdly long day, to a blood bath I had no clue who it was under the blood as they didn’t look familiar (he was the only one that tall, he probably was asked if he played basketball every couple hours) The blood was real and honestly, I thought I was gonna see him in a few days… but I didn’t he was rushed to the hospital after fainting less than 5 minutes before the ambulance arrived, but something seemed off about him I saw him through the window rushing in and he seemed superficially concerned when he saw me it turned to real concern.  I tried not to think about it but his expression didn’t sit right with me, my therapist was surprised that was what I kept talking about, but I always had a high gore tolerance which went up even higher with my career.  About a week after I decided to paint my bathroom since I hadn’t had time till now and I hadn’t realized until now that the mirror could come off and what I saw horrified me… there was a hole in the next apartment, which I hadn't met the owner of until I looked at the ring-up sheet (the thing in the entrance so visitors can be let in) it was owned by the stabbed man! I looked in the hole a bit more after I calmed down and it went to his bathroom which had some… things in it, specifically a car winder breaker thing, a few knives (one looked like a butcher knife and another looked like a filet knife and there was a few more), and a ski mask! If he wouldn’t have gotten stabbed and beat with a hammer due to a failed robbery I wouldn’t be here to write this message… it is now sinking in that he didn’t die… I feel sick I’m gonna lay down… [I think I need to get out of here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trygor/)… maybe get a gun.",

        "text": "  \n\n‘It was a long and lonely road, straight as a wheat stalk and dry like you wouldn’t believe. My car sat idling on the yellow line, burping out exhaust as the sun lay bleeding on the horizon. I’d come a long way with further yet to go, but something in me, something itchy and unnerving said that it was time to stop.’\n\nI looked at the words glowing on my phone. It was a prompt for some writer’s group or something.\n\n‘Sounds like something King would write,’ I thought. ‘And we all know what a hack he’s become. I wish I could churn out trash like he does and make millions from it. But I’m no writer.’\n\n“Cleanup on aisle A15,” blared over the radio clipped to my hip.\n\nI knew it was my turn but still glanced around the break room for anyone I could get to do it for me. Unfortunately, there was no one. While I had been zoned out staring at my phone like a zombie, everyone else had finished their break and left. Which meant I had something to look forward to after cleaning up some customer’s mess… a butt-chewing from my crew leader, Amy.\n\nI left the break room and headed for the supply room to get my mop and bucket. Aisle A15 was on the other side of the store, so I knew it wouldn’t be long until…\n\n“Cleanup on aisle A15,” the radio blared more forcefully.\n\nI ripped it off my belt, thinking of all the things I’d like to say in response, but I swallowed my pride and said, “En route.”\n\nWhen I got there. Amy was standing beside a puddle of something brown and liquid that I didn’t want to identify. She had her arms folded across her chest and was tapping her toe.\n\n“Did you finally finish your break?” she said with no hint of actual interest.\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” I said pulling my bucket next to the puddle and slopping water onto it.\n\n“Watch it,” she said as some of the water mixed with the brown liquid and splashed onto her shoes. \n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said, not meaning a word of it.\n\nHer face turned fire engine red and looked like it was about to explode. \n\n“You’re fired!” she squealed.\n\nI found it odd that such a large woman would have such a high voice when angry.\n\n“You can’t fire me,” I said leaning on my mop. “You’re only a crew leader, not a member of management.”\n\nShe opened her mouth to say something, then closed it as her face turned an even deeper shade of red.\n\n“We’ll see,” she sputtered, then turned to storm off nearly falling slipping on her wet shoe. She recovered and continued storming away as I did everything I could not to burst into tears laughing.\n\nI finished my odious chore and took the bucket back to the supply room to empty and rinse it. I had to rinse the bucket a few times to get the stench out. I smiled thinking about Amy trying to get it out of her shoe. \n\nBy the time I was done, I stepped out to a store with half the lights off. I breathed a sigh of relief. My shift overlapped with Amy’s shift. We would come in a few hours before the store closed and once it did, we were free to go do our restocking and cleaning duties.\n\nThe first hour was usually spent dodging cashiers as they took their trays to count. After they left, we locked the doors and it was only Myself, Sam, and Greg in the massive, empty store. \n\nI won’t lie, there were times my imagination got the best of me as I roamed the empty aisles of the half-lit store. And the three of us have played pranks on each other. But tonight wasn’t starting out like that. Sam wasn’t feeling good and was already talking about going home early. Greg was in his zone with his earbuds in, listening to creepypastas as he stocked the shelves.\n\nI had just pulled my third skid out of the stock room when something darted in front of me. I stopped so quickly that the pallet’s forward momentum pushed me, nearly knocking me over.\n\n“Very funny, guys,” I said into my radio. “You can knock it off now.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” Sam said. \n\n“Whoever’s hiding by the stockroom doors can come out now, I’m not falling for it.”\n\n“I’m over in hardware and Greg is a few aisles down from me in automotive,” Sam said.\n\n“Sure you are,” I said.\n\n“Look over towards hardware,” Sam said. \n\nAs I did, I saw a beam of light flash up toward the dark part of the ceiling.\n\n“Did you see my light?”\n\n“Yes, I did,” I said slowly, suddenly not wanting to turn the corner toward where the whatever it was had just disappeared.\n\n“What did you see?” Sam said.\n\n“Must’ve just been my imagination,” I said, trying to convince myself as much as him.\n\n“Ok, you good?”\n\n“Yeah, no problem.”\n\nI pulled my pallet jack forward slowly and peeked around the corner. Nothing was there except a seemingly endless aisle of shelves. \n\nI shook myself mentally for allowing myself to get spooked so easily, then pulled my pallet jack down the aisle past toys and into housewares. I forced myself to stare straight ahead and not glance down the aisles as I passed them. \n\nAs I passed the last toy aisle, my pallet truck seemed to get heavier. It was as if one of the wheels was stuck on something. I stopped and went around the back to check the wheels. There, sitting in the middle of the floor was a large stuffed bear that was around three feet high.\n\n“Where did you come from, little guy?” I said.\n\nI didn’t think it had been on my pallet, but I sat it on top to take to the display near the front of the store.\n\nAs I made the turn towards the main aisle, I passed Sam heading back with an empty pallet.\n\n“Looks like I found a passenger,” I said with a smile.\n\n“Who’s that?” Sam said.\n\n“The little guy on top,” I said turning and pointing at the bear. Except the bear was gone.\n\n“What passenger?” Sam said.\n\n‘He must’ve fallen off,’ I told myself.\n\n“Made ya look,” I said.\n\nSam gave me an odd look then a half-hearted chuckle.\n\n“Good one,” he said, pulling his empty pallet back towards the stock room.\n\nOnce he was out of sight I looked around for the bear, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nI shrugged. ‘Maybe it did just fall off.’ \n\nI pulled my pallet down the aisle toward a central spot where most of my merchandise was displayed. I pulled out my box cutter and sliced the plastic wrap open, then started the boring task of stocking the shelves.\n\nI found myself envious of Greg having earbuds to listen to something. I would have to invest some of my hard-earned minimum wage money in a set to make this job less boring. \n\nAs I loaded merchandise on the shelves, I heard a sound like something fell off a shelf. At first, I thought Greg had dropped something. But then it hit me. I hadn’t seen Greg’s pallet truck in the main aisle. \n\nI stepped out and looked up and down the main aisle. Nothing was there. Come to think of it, I hadn’t heard Sam come back through with his next load either. Usually, they load the pallets by section, so we work through the store methodically. I guess Sam’s load was the exception.\n\nI went back to stocking shelves with an odd feeling in the back of my head. For some reason, I couldn’t shake it. I felt very alone tonight. I wondered if someone was planning a prank on me.\n\nI really didn’t mind. It helped the night go faster.\n\nI eventually finished my pallet and decided to go back to the stock room the long way and find the other guys. If they were planning something, maybe I could catch them in the act.\n\nI was halfway around to the front of the store when I saw a pallet that was only half empty. I looked around but didn’t see anyone. I shrugged it off and went past when I noticed drops of red on the white floor. They led from the pallet down another aisle. I followed the trail only to find a massive puddle of red, and Greg laying motionless in the middle of it.\n\nFor a split second, I froze. Panic gripped me until I remembered who was laying there. \n\nThis was the guy who set up a costume that made it look like he had been decapitated last Halloween, complete with fake spraying blood. I remember how angry Amy had been when he sprayed her. It was the best Halloween ever. Her threatening to fire us was just the icing on the cake.\n\n“Have fun cleaning that up,” I said as I turned away from the still body and went back to my pallet. I steered it around the mess so I wouldn’t spread it any further. \n\n‘He better clean that up soon,’ I thought. ‘Before it stains the floor. That might actually get him fired if Amy finds out.’\n\nOn my way back to the stock room I heard footsteps. They weren’t loud. I could tell someone was trying to sneak up on me, but being quiet about it.\n\nI could just envision Greg tiptoeing behind me to jump out of an aisle, covered in fake blood, and scare me. \n\nThat would be so awesome if I was watching it happen to someone else, but I was a little annoyed. Greg’s little prank was getting us further behind in our stocking chores which meant further behind in our cleaning chores. Not to mention that he had made a huge mess, and I wasn’t cleaning that up, even though the front was my assigned section for the night.\n\nI’d had enough. I stopped my pallet truck and whipped around only to catch a glimpse of someone dodging behind a rack of clothes.\n\n“Alright, Greg,” I said. “You got me. I’m so scared out of my mind right now.”\n\nI looked at the floor and there was a faint line of red footprints, but they had faded like someone had followed for a while and the red was wearing off with every step they took.\n\n“Are you kidding me right now?” I said. “I’m done with this little prank. You’re cleaning all those footprints up.”\n\nI turned and dragged my pallet truck off at exasperated speed.\n\n“Children,” I mumbled angrily. “I work with children.”\n\nI reached the stock room and kicked the doors open making them smack against the wall loudly.\n\n‘I don’t care. Maybe Greg will get it that I’m pissed and knock this crap off.’\n\nI drove my pallet truck into the next pallet but it wouldn’t go. I looked and there was already a pallet truck that had picked up this load from the other side. \n\nI stepped around to find Sam laying on the floor in a puddle of red liquid.\n\n“Dammit, you too? Enough of this. We need to get our work done!”\n\nI reached down and grabbed his arm but his body didn’t move. I pulled his head up out of the puddle and then let it go. It fell with a heavy thunk.\n\nA cold wave crept over me as my shaking hand pressed against my neck and waited to feel a pulse. A minute later I pulled my hand away without feeling anything.\n\nI looked at the red liquid on my hand and recoiled.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, something caught my attention. \n\nIt was the stuffed bear, sitting on the floor just outside the pool of blood. There were dark spots on its fur that I hadn’t seen before and laying on the floor beside it was a large butcher’s knife.\n\nMy mind refused to believe what I was seeing. I knew it was impossible, and yet there lay my dead friend in his own blood as proof. \n\nSomeone had to have staged this. It couldn’t be real. \n\nAs those thoughts chased each other around my mind, the impossible happened. The bear’s head moved.\n\nIt turned and looked right at me. Then its eyes began to glow red. It was like someone had turned on a set of red LEDs, but I knew that wasn’t possible. These bears were just stuffed. We sold them all the time. I’ve never seen one with lights in it.\n\nAnd came the next impossibility. It stood. \n\nThe bottoms of its feet were round, so it wobbled a little trying to gain its balance. And then it leaned over and picked up the knife.\n\nIts hands were just stitched at the end of the arms to give it the appearance of a palm and fingers. When it picked up the knife the fur wrapped around the handle and lifted it. It was like watching someone picking it up with a sock puppet on their hand.\n\nI watched in morbid fascination as this thing looked from the knife to me.\n\nMy mind was screaming at me to get up, to do anything other than just sit there and wait for this monster with an innocent smiling face to end my life horribly like it had done to my friends.\n\nI patted my pockets looking for anything useful to defend myself. All I came up with was a handful of change and my box cutter. I pushed the blade out as far as it would go… one whole inch. \n\nAs defensive weapons went, it sucked. Especially against a murderous, psychotic stuffed bear holding a butcher knife.\n\nI can honestly say that’s one thought I never in my life could’ve anticipated thinking.\n\nMy mind snapped me out of my reverie by reminding me of the seriousness of the situation. \n\nI jumped up, slipping and nearly falling on the bloody floor, before gaining my balance and holding the box cutter out in front of me. \n\nIt paused as if noting the ludicrousness of my actions, then charged at me, slashing with the knife.\n\nI dodged backpedaling as it charged. Each slash came closer to slicing one of my legs. I reached the end of the hallway and bolted through the stock room doors. As I did, I felt pain in my right leg, but I didn’t stop to examine it. I ran as fast as I could away from the stock room. \n\nIt wasn’t until I was on the far side of the store that I paused to look at my injury. Blood was pouring from my leg and it had left an easy trail to follow. \n\nI looked up at the sign that said, ‘Health and beauty aids’, with an arrow helpfully pointing the way to the section that was on the other side of the store, a good hundred yards away.\n\nI opened a roll of paper towels off the shelf and wrapped my leg in an impromptu bandage until I could get the proper supplies.\n\nAs I finished, I saw a little brown head peek around the corner a dozen yards away.\n\nIn any other circumstance, it might’ve been almost cute. In this one, I knew it was deadly. In running to the far side of the store, I unintentionally trapped myself in a corner. \n\nI looked around for anything I could use to defend myself. I grabbed a mop from the shelf and swung it at the bear knocking it off its feet. Unfortunately, it rolled with it and was standing again before I had finished my swing.\n\nIt dove at me, knife outstretched, but I managed to hit it with the mop before it stabbed me. \n\nI didn’t wait around to celebrate. I ran toward health and beauty aids. When I got there, I quickly found the bandage I needed and ran to another part of the store.\n\nI was sucking wind and had a stitch in my side. There was no way I could keep up this pace. Eventually, it would wear me down to the point where I couldn’t evade it, and then I was done.\n\nI needed to hide until I could figure out a plan. The offices seemed the best place, but they were a dead end. If I hid there I’d be trapped for sure. There was nowhere else I could hide that it couldn’t get to me, except for maybe the freezer. But what would be the use of hiding from the thing and freezing to death in the process?\n\nI needed to get out. \n\nGreg was the one who had locked up, but I didn’t know if he kept the keys with him or put them back in the office.       \n\nThere was only one way to find out and it was near the front of the store. I glanced around and noticed the sporting goods section. Checking all around for the stuffed bear of death, I went to sporting goods and picked out a nice baseball bat.\n\nNow at least I’d have a sporting chance.\n\nI pulled a ten-speed bike off the rack and mounted it as the furball came around the corner. I took off down the aisle, smacking its head with my bat as I passed. \n\nI glanced back to see it jump up and race after me. I shook my head and turned back around just in time to avoid running into a display. \n\nI pedaled harder to put some distance between me and it. Greg’s body was coming up fast and I knew I didn’t have much time. \n\nI slid the bike to a stop, rolled his dead body over, and searched his pocket for the keys. I started to panic when I came up empty. I searched the other pocket and hit paydirt at the same time the knife hit me. \n\nI dove away from the attack, my shoulder screaming in pain, and swung the bat at it. I connected with the knife and knocked it away. \n\nThe bear jumped on me and started swinging, showering me with lefts and rights of stunning ferocity. Surprisingly, there wasn’t much impact. It felt like I was being pummeled by pillows. It seemed to sense I wasn’t being hurt and jumped off me to retrieve the knife. I took the opportunity to hop on my bike and head for the door.\n\nUnfortunately, the tire had gotten some blood on it and I only made it a short distance before losing control and tumbling into a soda display. Bottles of soda falling on me hurt, but not as much as the time I was losing until the monster caught up with me again.\n\nI stumbled to my feet slipping over one last bottle before running toward the door with the monster close behind.\n\nI got to the door and shoved the key in the lock, nearly snapping it off trying to turn it quickly. I prayed the ‘please help me and I’ll never do anything bad again’ prayer as I struggled to open the doors with the monster bearing down on me, wielding its newly found knife.\n\nI slipped through and then turned my attention to closing the doors behind me.\n\nThey were almost back together when it arrived. It slashed the knife through the thin opening, just missing my leg as it tried to keep me from locking the door. The key turned most of the way then stopped. I struggled to close the door the last fraction of an inch as the monster continued to slash at me. \n\nIt wasn’t working. As long as the knife was keeping the doors from closing all the way, I couldn’t lock them.\n\nI devised a brilliantly foolish plan. I shoved the doors open, surprising it for an instant. Then lashed out, grabbing the handle of the knife and kicking the monster at the same time. It went reeling, and I held the knife as it lost its grip.\n\nI stared at the knife for a second, then threw it down and closed the doors as the monster jumped up and charged. I was able to get them closed and locked before it could do anything to stop me.\n\nI leaned my forehead against the glass as the furball glared up at me pounding on the door in impotent rage. The glass easily withstood the assault. I knelt down and stared into those glowing red eyes. \n\nEven now, in relative safety, I wondered what this thing was and why it had done this. It stopped beating on the door long enough to return my gaze. It was hypnotic. I found myself staring blankly into the glowing red. \n\nAfter a minute, I shook myself, unlocked the outside door, and stepped out into the cool night air. \n\nI took a deep breath, feeling safer than I had but also having my world seem a little more frightening knowing that such things existed and that no one would believe me.\n\nI checked my injuries as I limped over to the employee section of the parking lot, which was of course the farthest away from the store.    \n\nAs I opened my car, I noticed there were three other cars still parked there. Sam and Greg’s cars would be hauled out eventually. I mourned the loss of my friends and wondered if I would be blamed for their deaths.\n\nAt the moment, I was too tired to care about the future further than going home and going to bed. I didn’t even think about calling the cops. One last night's sleep in my bed was all I wanted.\n\nThen my eyes fell on the third car.\n\nIt was Amy’s. She should’ve been gone hours ago. And yet here she was, sitting in her car. \n\nI limped up to see if everything was ok. The closer I got, I could see she had her eyes closed but her mouth was moving. I could hear a soft murmur like she was humming a tune or something.\n\nI tapped on the window and her eyes shot open so quickly that I took a half step back.\n\nShe looked at me and her face turned from calm to sheer terror. She started her car and sped out of the parking lot, nearly running over my foot in the process.\n\nI thought about her odd behavior as I collapsed into my car and started the engine. \n\nI drove in front of the store and looked in through the doors to find the bear laying down in front of them.\n\nI stopped the car and got out. I opened both doors and went in to look at the bear. \n\nI poked it with my foot and it didn’t move.\n\nI rolled it over and looked into its eyes. They were brown. In fact, the only reminder of the horror that this thing had inflicted was the dark spots on its fur.\n\nMy mind started adding up all the things that led to the impossible. It couldn’t be real, but then after everything else that went on tonight, I was pretty low on skepticism.\n\nI picked up the knife and stuck it in my waistband. Then I reached for the bear slowly and cautiously. \n\nI lifted it, watching its eyes for any hint of red, then carried it out and put it in the trunk of my car. \n\nI pulled out my phone and looked up Amy’s address and drove to her house. \n\nI parked across the street where I wouldn’t be noticed and got out. I looked up and down the street and saw no one moving. Checking my watch it was two thirty in the morning. \n\nI opened the trunk and lifted the bear, noticing the eyes had just a hint of red. \n\nI carried it across the street and up to the front door. By the time I got there, the eyes had gotten brighter and I could feel it starting to move.\n\nI quickly shoved it in between the storm door and the main door. I threw the knife in with it then shut the storm door, rang the doorbell, and ran to my car. \n\nI got inside and slunk down just enough to be able to see when the porch light came on. \n\nI saw the inside door open.\n\nThat’s when the screams began.\n\nI listened for a few minutes, feeling justified as well as horrified until they stopped. \n\nI stared at the long straight road ahead, lit up like a runway, and wondered what would happen next. Something in me, something unnerving told me I would never stop running.",

        "text": " When I was around the age of 10-11, I used to live in the middle of practically nowhere, It was the same, Never-ending Grass fields, The same scenery for miles. My house was a tiny cabin, one room, a little sink and wood countertop, little bathroom place , that's all. I lived with my mum, dad and my older brother, Mark who was 13 at the time. He was a troublemaker, And with his little ventures, He dragged me in just so it was both of us if we ever got caught.  \nNear our house, There was a seemingly infinite forest. It was thick of trees and grass, bushes, plants. The forest was pretty dry, Our region didn't receive rainfall very often, And when it did, It rained for a good measure of time, And it rained heavily. Me and Mark had explored the forest numerous times, Although we didn't go very far because both of us were afraid of it, Mostly because of what our parents told us.  \nThere was this one time, I'll never forget. It was Mid-November, It was raining pretty heavy and our mum and dad were asleep, Mark was obviously bored and wanted to get us into trouble. So he convinced me to join him to have a little walk around the forest. We put on our raincoats and grabbed an umbrella, Part of me was afraid mum and dad would wake up and find out, And the other part was afraid of the forest. Something about those stories that our parents told us just for us to not get into danger really got to me but Mark wasn't an easy person, If he wanted to do something, He wanted to do it right then and no matter what you tell him he wouldn't back down. Which was the many reasons it was him who was grounded most of the time. And me ? I was grounded too, But since he always dragged me with him, Mum and dad blamed me too.  \nSo, me and Mark sneaked out of our house, careful to not wake up our parents, we decided to grab a flashlight after, realizing it got pretty dark because the forest was anyways covered with trees. It must've been about 6 when we left, the sun didn't set yet but even if it did it wouldn't make much of a difference because the clouds above hid each beam of the sunlight which hit the ground. Mark and I were just with each other, I held the umbrella, and he held the flashlight, we entered the forest and shone the flashlight, The forest was covered with moss, sticks and the ground was wet with the rain, The flashlight beam caused the forest to give out a blue-ish hue, And it felt really cool. Little sounds of birds chirping, some animals and the water gently but rapidly splashing down were heard. We were sure that there weren't any predatory animals because the forest may have been thick and large but it wasn't a good habitat for predatory animals. We walked down the forest, looking around, It soon grew really cold and we both regretted not wrapping up warmly enough. We looked around and scared ourselves by our own shadows, And we realized it wasn't as fun as we thought it would be. So we made a decision to go even deeper in. And to our surprise, We found an old barn, decayed and abandoned, Creepy atmosphere. And that was when Mark made the stupid choice of checking it out. And since I was creeped out enough to go out of the forest alone, I had no choice but to stay with him until he decides it's time to go.  \nWe nudged the door, a little creak escaped and we set our foot in. The floor creaked beneath us and our flashlight kept on flickering. It was really warm inside surprisingly, so we felt better. The barn was empty from the inside, A bit of old hay, around and plants that engulfed the floorboards, We decided we should leave when Mark noticed a flight of stairs, He instantly convinced me to investigate it with him, And so we went upstairs. The place had a weird atmosphere upstairs, It was really moist and we thought we saw blood stains. We noticed a little room at the corner, The door slightly ajar. We entered of course, And we saw old mattresses, Food, and stained knives. The food seemed fresh and we quickly realized we might be where we aren't supposed to, And that's when we spotted a person. Blood laced his hands, His clothes, And his face displayed insanity. He clearly noticed us way before we did, Because he held a butcher knife, And looked as if he were to jump up any moment now, Mark instantly realized what was going on and grabbed my hand and fled as fast as his legs could take him, And this caused the man to charge at us, I was behind and I noticed it, I screamed and let go of the flashlight, Which hit his foot and he groaned loudly. Mark sped up even more at that and hand in hand, We both charged back to our house as fast as we could.  \nWhen we reached back, we found our parents talking to a policeman, who we guess they called because they couldn't find us. We were terrified and they noticed. We told them about the man we saw and all about what happened, The police took notice and ordered five armed men to go catch the man. Fast forward an hour or two, They didn't find anyone, But they did find the stuff that was in the barn which made them believe us. After this we moved to a more urban area and our parents didn't trust us alone for a few years. But the incident is stuck to me really well, I remember it vividly, It still makes me have nightmares to this day. And Mark learned his lesson well, Thankfully.",

        "text": "This is a high school based horror story that happened  to me when I was in my first semester of high school, so I was still new to my school in general. I wasn't the most social person which is an aspect about me that plays an important role in this story. Before high school, I didn't have so many friends that treated me very well, which did make me more antisocial. So i figured I'd make a bunch of new friends when high school started. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became friends with this one kid who also went to my middle school who I'll just refer to as Joe. Joe was a guy that I seemed to have quite a bit in common with, I followed him on social medias and we primarily talked through DMs on Instagram, but eventually we started texting. I honestly didn't see much wrong with the dude at first, but I noticed he gradually became more of a bad and overall sketchy kid. Around 4 months into us knowing each other, he sent me a pretty bizarre text that read \"yo meet up with me and my friend Daniel next week it's hella important\". Confused as to what was so important about I asked \"um ok? how is it important\" he replied \"it's a surprise\". At this point I was getting a little weirded out, but I didn't think much of it. \"I don't like surprises that much\" I said. He then replied \"I promise you'll like it, you can trust me right\". I left it off with \"yeah i guess so\". I noticed that as we were texting and talking regularly, he started to act so fucking rude to me out of nowhere. When I would ask for advice he would say \"just get better\", Overall giving off bad vibes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day came that he asked if I could hang out (mind you I completely forgot all about the whole \"having a surprise for me\" thing). I replied \"no I can't today I have somewhere to go for a while\", he said \"meet us tomorrow then\". The next day came, I was eating lunch so this was around 12pm and I received a text from Joe asking if I was coming or not\". I said \"yea hold on I'm eating lunch\" and he said \"bro hurry the fuck up it's cold\". He followed that up with a guilt trippy phone call saying \"man I can't believe you'd leave us in the cold like that\". I honestly thought it was pretty ridiculous how impatient they were being. I finally came out, I noticed they were right outside my house, downright creepy honestly. I didn't really know who this Daniel guy was, I had seen him around school sometimes. I would be lying if I said he looked very fucking sketchy, definitely someone you wouldn't want to say the wrong thing to. They asked me to follow them and so I did. Mid doing this I asked \"where are we going\" \"it's something cool I promise\" they said. That was weird, I honestly thought about making up some lie saying how I had to go but I didn't, I wanted to see this through. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about 5 minutes they said \"we're here\". I was dumbfounded, it was an old decrepit house that had been foreclosed for years. I thought we were gonna explore it. I feel like a fool for not picking up on any red flags there. We went inside the house through a back entrance that was covered up by overgrown shrubs. They told me to peak in first because they have been there before and said \"they\" wouldn't recognize me. I don't know who \"they\" was but that's besides the point. I went in, peaked around and shouted out \"uh I don't think anyone is in here\". They were about 8 feet from me when they said \"yo check out over there\" I looked in and three things happened at once. I heard manic footsteps, felt my whole body being pushed down and against a wall, and had multiple punches being thrown at my face. I honestly thought all this was a prank to scare me. That was until I was pinned down and Daniel yelled in my ear \"HEY, YOU DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS, OR ELSE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR YOU BUD\". In a shaky yet calm voice i said \"okay okay, this is safe with me\". \"NOW GET OUT, SCRAM\" he yelled back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran away from there faster than I knew I could, while frantically dialing my dad's number to tell him all about it as I was running back. I turned around for a split second and they were following me for a little bit and then stopped. I noticed in that split second, Daniel pulling out something from his pocket as I was running away, I didn't see what it was though. Once my dad saw me, it was a screaming match of him yelling \"WHAT'S GOING ON TELL ME\" and me yelling back \"THEY BEAT ME ASS MAN\". he then yelled back \"GET IN THE CAR WE'RE FINDING THEM\" we looked all over town, but they weren't anywhere around. Another thing that sucks is that they stole my favorite beanie that i brought because it was cold. The next day I repeated the whole story back to my schools police officer and principal. Because of the track record of Daniel and Joe, and the with texts I received from Joe, I managed to get them both expelled. I found out that before Joe was expelled, he told one of his friends that he genuinely thought about killing me after I told the principal and police about the whole situation. I'm forever grateful they didn't do anything else since then. It's been about 4 months since this whole thing and looking back now I don't know how I was so oblivious to so many red flags. If anything else does happen, I'll update.",

        "text": "I'm a nurse in my city's local hospital, it's a small city, so only one hospital that doesn't get too busy really. I work night shifts, and rarely get new patients I have to sign in so if anything it's quite boring because most of the time the things people come in for can wait till morning.\n\nI don't really mind, it takes a lot of the stress away from what is otherwise a really stressful job. But there's still plenty of that to go around, like the sheer anxiety I get when tending to my newest patient, Alisha.\n\nShe's just recently been diagnosed with type two diabetes, and isn't doing well. I've requested multiple times for her to be examined, speculating she may have sun downers.\n\nSometimes, she's an angel. The type of old lady you'd expect, shriveled and weak but wise and polite even in her old age when she could be bitter and no one would really blame her.\n\nWell the past few nights, when I've came into her room she's demanded that she wants to speak to her husband. I, gently as I could reminded her he is no longer wish us she started insisting I was his mistress.\n\nShe called me a harlot, trying and failing to get up and out of her bed.\n\nI requested another nurse was set for her routine night care. I was relieved when another nurse was called in for her.\n\nWell, tonight when I was settling down to monitor some of my patients Amanda, a coworker reminded me I was in charge of Alisha.\n\nI was no longer in charge of her, I told her. She shook her head, \"No. Lana called out today. Sorry, I'd take care of it for you but I'm busy.\" She stepped out of the office.\n\nI, annoyed trudged to Alishas room before painting my best costumer service face over my former pissed one.\n\nI poked my head around the corner, knocking on the wall to be polite. \"... Come in.\" Alisha said in a sinister, yet cold tone.\n\n\"How are we feeling today?\" I said, stepping into the room praying there would be no talk of her late husband.\n\n\"Limber.\" She said, looking at me dead in the eyes. I expected a smile, or something to indicate she was joking but she did no such thing.\n\n\"Haha.. Yeah. I'm glad.\" I said, chuckling a bit. I handed her her Dixie cup and pills she was set to take at night.\n\n\"You take those. Should I take your blood sugar or will you?\" I pulled out her little kit of supplies. \"I will.\" She snatched the kit from me, like a child.\n\n\"Let's see, what are we today?\" I leaned over to check, and to my shock her levels were miraculously the best they'd been since she was admitted.\n\n\"I feel good.\" She said stiffly. \"Oh wow, good for you Alisha.\" I finished up her care quickly as I could. Despite the fact she was acting the most normal she'd been in days, being in that room sent a primal fear through my veins.\n\n\n\nI finished my rounds for that night, settling in at my desk while I did logs and monitored my patients on the security cameras. \n\nThe time whipped past me, and soon my eyes fell droopy. Yawning, I flicked my phone on. 1:45 am. I still have some time left on my shift. I peer up at the security cameras. \n\nFor a good few seconds, I didn't notice. I didn't notice Alisha up right in her bed, rocking back in forth. Her face burried deep in between her knees. \n\nAs a nurse, my first instict should be to go check up on her. To tell her she's okay and get her settled back under her covers and in her bed. \n\nBut as a human everything in me told me to stay the fuck away. I watched, wide eyed like a frozen deer as a 1000 pound metal death machine raced towards it. \n\nShe stopped rocking and I wondered if it was okay to just leave it alone, since I knew another nurse would be here fairly soon. But before I could even reason with myself, she swung herself over the side of her bed, her movements jerky and erratic. \n\nShe hobbled over to the little jar of cotton balls, unscrewing the lid and shoving her hand into the jar. She shoved them into her mouth, an oddly morbid sight as cotton balls hung out her mouth. \n\nHer eyes were empty and off in space, and drool hung out her mouth. God, I thought. I better call someone. Shes not looking good. \n\nHer grasp on the jar loosened, as it crashed to the floor. She stepped into the glass shards, wincing as she did so. She opened the door to her room, looking out into the hallway, her mouth agape. \n\nShit. I'm gonna have to go deal with this. She's now out of frame and I figure it's time I be a woman and go actually collect her. \n\nI sigh, standing up from my office chair. Patter patter patter. The sound of bare foot steps echo throughout the hallway. But yet, it didn't sound right. Like there was two people walking. Four sets of foot steps. \n\nI peek my head out the door, and before I even get a chance to think or process what I was seeing she came barreling towards me. \n\nHer loose nightgown draped over her as she hobbled along the shiny floor on all fours. She ran with no grace, consistently falling on her face as she snarled and growled. \n\nI fell back into my room, slamming the door shut and locking it. I shakily reached for the phone to call security. \n\nIt didn't take long for them to get there and I could hear the struggle they were having with her. The rest of the night was sort of a hazy blur. \n\nI went home, feeling like I'd just witnessed something far more than just a crazy old woman. But you have to shake that off when you work in fields like this. Things happen, and not every things that serious. But there's always that chance. \n\nThe next day went slowly, but much slower with the absence of Alisha. No arguments of me being a slut for her dead husband and no late night attacks. \n\nThat night I felt some unease, it was my same routine of watching the security cameras but yet I convinced myself something would happen again. \n\nI kept glancing back up at the cameras, anticipating the return Alisha rocking back and forth and back in forth in her bed. \n\nI finished my logs and decided maybe I should just go walk around, clear my head and check on everyone before I left. \n\nI cleaned up my office, grabbed my things and left to go check around. I was met with trash  scattered across the floor when I stepped out, as I scooped it back into its bin I began to hear it. \n\nIalmost sounded like rain. Little crackles, consistent and faint. I chucked the last piece of trash into the bin and rose to my feet. My viens ran icy cold, and I got that same dipping feeling in your stomach. \n\nThe same sinking feeling that rushes from your head to the deepest pit of your stomach, overwhelming your whole body with the sensation of doom. \n\nShe peaked her head around the corner, not Alisha, but one of my favorite patients. Malai was an older woman, in her late 70's. She was a relief to visit. \n\nShe had many stories of her arrival to America, of the culture shock she felt coming here from Thailand and I always listened intently. \n\nThat same crackling and popping noise grew less faint, as she stepped around the corner. Her hands were grotesquely twitching, her feet shuffling in place like she had no control of anything she was doing. \n\n\"Malai?\" I uttered, stepping back. Her eyes glazed over as she fell back into the hard ground. \"Malai, oh shit!\" I rushed towards her, thinking maybe she was going to full on seize. \n\nAs I knelt to her side she attempted to grab onto my shirt, constantly grabbing and letting go and grabbing again. She sobbed profusely as she cracked and contorted. \n\nShe finally got a good grip on me and pulled me closer. \"He wants us all.\" She cried, finally stopping her jerky movements. She gasped, croaking and bellowing before falling silent. \n\n\"What the fuck!\" Hot tears rolled down my face, wetting my mouth with that gross salty taste. \"Help, oh my god-\" I wailed. \n\n\n\nCreeeeaaaaaak. Pop. Crack. Crreeeeaaakk. Pop. Crack. Crrreeeeakkkk. Pop. Crack. \n\nThe sounds became deafening quickly, as more and more of the ill patients turned into those grotesque things. It didn't take Malai long to wake up, me being to focused on the noise of seemingly every patient cracking she grabbed me by my shoulders gasping loudly. \n\nIt didn't take me long to figure out how it was spreading as she did so, feeling all life drain from me and being replaced by an overpowering urge to drain someone else. \n\nI slumped into one of the benches in the Hall, putting my hand on my head as the wails of other nurses turning echoed through the halls as the quiet hospital descending into madness. \n\nI rubbed my temple, and began to rock back in forth writhing in pain. It felt as if all my bones were stiffening, along with my muscle. I felt sluggish and weak, like I really.. Really needed some energy. \n\n\"Oh my god, are you..?\" Myah, my trainee came around the corner hovering over me. She was so full of life. So much so.. That as she knelt down to my level to examine my I began to fight the urge. \n\nThe urge her to suck her of all her life.. Too.",

        "text": "Have you ever wanted to punch a routine right in the face? The same bridge. The same traffic. The same rotting deer corpse playing chicken with the same ravens and road crews. I have commuted down the turnpike for fifteen years. The thought of counting out the hours actually makes me sick. Today, I just needed something different. A change in the pattern. A spoke in the wheel. A left turn, for once, instead of a decade and a half of rights.\n\nThere is an exit on my route where the road is typically blocked by road crews. They never seem to be working on anything. One guy in a safety vest stands by the machinery. Another rests. Sometimes you can spot a third, rushing back and forth importantly with a clipboard and a hardhat, but the jackhammers stay silent. The road remains unpaved and people still get paid. Pretty typical for my country. \n\nBack in the day, this particular street led to a tunnel which dove underneath the river and spit back out on the other side of town. The traffic split up nicely and folks could make it into the city in an hour flat. But ever since they shut it down, there’s only one way in, and a one-hour commute has turned to two or even three on a rough one.\n\nI woke up absurdly early this morning. My plan was to get to the office, print out a few things, swipe my badge and leave. I had a doctor’s appointment in the afternoon. My dad wanted to stop by for dinner. My mind was already *off* work before the day even began. I think that’s what pissed me off the most. I had a plan. Everything should have worked out okay according to the plan.\n\nAnd then there was traffic. \n\nThe bridge backed up six miles by six AM. This should not be happening. I slammed at the steering wheel like a child. I bruised my finger on the dash. The radio hummed an update of an accident ahead. The delay would take me well past my normal arrival time. I woke up early for nothing. I could have left later and gotten in at the same time. The day was shot from the beginning for the umpteenth time.\n\nI sat there a while, seething, eyeing a lady and her stroller on the sidewalk. She made it to the end of the block and turned. By the time I made it there, she was gone. My phone buzzed. I knew my boss wanted to talk. He always wanted to talk. Always about budgets and meetings to be discussed before the actual discussion. I cut around a minivan and strafed into the left lane. I slammed on the brakes. And that’s when I saw it. \n\nThe shortcut was unblocked. \n\nNo guy with a clipboard. No surveyor sitting with a sandwich. A lonely road divider stood in the way of a row of cars. Any idiot could sneak past it. That idiot was me. I nudged the gas and pushed forward. Traffic inched back to get out of the way. A Winnebago honked. I honked. The driver gave me the finger as we met nearly a foot away in all of the congestion. Our bumpers nearly bumped, but the empty exit lane opened up in front of me. \n\nJackpot.\n\nI drove slowly for fear of arousing attention. The uneven gravel bumped underneath my tires. A year of construction had done nothing to quell the pipes and who-knows-what that ran under that particular part of town. I took the toll road for a few minutes until it passed underneath the shadow of the bridge. Then came the tunnel. \n\nThe entrance appeared moderately updated with large non-functioning digital screens. Two lanes converged into one before a wealth of blackness opened up ahead of it. The toll booth seemed operational but turned off with the gates pushed up. I didn’t get more than a few feet before a set of motion activated lights lit up the route ahead. I spurred ahead. \n\nDaylight dipped into a neat little hole in my rear view. \n\nThen it was gone. \n\nThe tunnel narrowed and twisted before it bent into a wide straightaway. Metal hatches and service doors checkered across my peripherals. Some were open, some were closed. I kept expecting to see a construction worker, a yellow hat, a sign or something to stop me and tell me to turn around. But nothing was there. \n\nAfter ten minutes it became apparent I had driven longer than what should be necessary. I started to panic around twenty. By then it was too late to turn around. The road thinned until the sides grated against my tires. I could smell smoke from the rubber burning. My palms were white. My breath was ragged. Natural light dripped in just ahead. I kept my hands steady and still through the tiny gap and shot out the other side like a baby leaving the womb. \n\nFreedom never felt so good.\n\nA thin layer of fog hung about the air. The road signs were familiar. I took a left and a sharp right and ended up on the driveway outside my office building. I pulled in to find a mostly empty parking lot. Two lone cars sat huddled together in the corner. Strange but not unusual for an early morning. My plans for the day uneasily went back into motion.\n\nMy building is your typical ten stack with a lobby on the bottom and differing companies on each floor. We enter through the security turnstiles in front, swipe a badge, and take an elevator up. My team is on the fifth floor. \n\nI headed inside and noticed that the security guard wasn’t at her desk yet. A plastic moveable sign read **AWAY**. The elevators sat unoccupied on the far side of the lobby. I walked over and hit the button. Nothing happened right away. I looked around and noticed some construction material strewn about the lobby. Screwdrivers and hammers sat arranged on a desk. Saws and masks on another. It looked like they were adding a new display screen. Two of the working ones showed a CGI dolphin swimming back and forth through a tank. I recognized it as the corporate logo.\n\nI hit the button again before realizing there was a problem. A single white piece of paper on the far right elevator door read a note in tiny black print.\n\n**OUT OF ORDER. USE STAIRS.**\n\nGreat.\n\nMy watch claimed 8:30 but it felt much later. I worried about the call with my boss. I worried about finding time to leave early. I kicked open a white door. I slid through another one. Paintings of sprawling landscapes and pristine mountain ranges decorated the walls. I found the door to the staircase. I opened it and let it shut conclusively behind me. I looked up from my phone and felt it fall from my hands. That’s when it finally fucking hit me. Right in the face, right in that stupid moment, everything had looked exactly the same until just right then. \n\nThis wasn’t my office. \n\nThe walls were white. The floors were checkered blue. There were three separate staircases. One went down, one went up, and one stayed straight - like some architect’s fucked up fever dream. I tried to go back but the door was locked. I tried to give it my weight but the frame wouldn't budge. A white sheet of paper sat stapled to a pin-board to my left. I pulled it off the wall and squinted at the text. \n\n**Take the staircase.**\n\nThanks, assholes. \n\nI considered my options in a heap of panic and wrecked nerves. Down probably led to a basement. That sounded scary. Straight didn’t make any fucking sense. Up might have lead to another office where somebody could point me in the right direction. That felt like the best bet. \n\nI hopped steps two at a time, hit the bend, and kept going up. I walked for about five full minutes. At some point there should have been a door. Typically when you go up a staircase it leads to a fucking door. This one did not. There were four more turns. Eventually the staircase merged into another. There were three similar options - up, down, or forward. The former had an ominous green light attached. I took the latter and went up, up, up. \n\nSix more turns and I found my door. \n\nThis one was open. I threw my arms into the crossbar. My feet flopped onto a slick tiled floor. I slipped and fell onto my face. It took another moment to take in my surroundings. Sprawled out in front of me was an Olympic sized pool. The water looked pristine and clear. But nobody was there.\n\nI shouted out for help as my ankle throbbed aggressively. I got up and limped my way along the perimeter. Pink buoys divided the water into neat little rows. Gentle waves lapped up against the edges. In the distance, a robot cleaned the bottom for gunk and whatever the hell else might infect an office building’s pool. I watched for a while until it started to move towards me. That made me limp a little faster. \n\nThere was a door on the far side of the pool, about thirty feet away. I had no idea what it would lead to. But the vibe in that room just started to feel wrong. I don't know why. The pool robot swerved to the right a bit when I looked at it. But every time I glanced back, it was closer, to the point where I could read the company branding on the pink and white hose.\n\n**WV Enterprises.**\n\nI reached the far door and pushed up against the handle. I took one last look at the pool, maybe humbling myself for being so scared, and noticed that the robot disappeared. Standing in its place was a woman with a pool rake. \n\n“Hello,” I smiled. “Can you help me?”\n\nShe looked at me quizzically. Sweat formed over the wrinkles on her brow. Stains covered her blouse. She wasn't wearing shoes. \n\n“No,” she screeched. “No. No. You’re not supposed to be here.” \n\nShe tossed the rake at me. I ducked. \n\n“Get out,” she laughed. “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.”\n\nA loud **BANG** sent me into high gear. I leaned into the door and felt it stick. Something was caught. A deep voice roared. I turned and the woman was gone. A shadow crept along the wall in her stead. An arm zipped across the floor and slipped up the slit of my jeans. The warmness of it was disgusting. I pushed harder and the door finally opened and shut in my sweating palms. I locked it on the other side just as a thin little finger slipped through and snapped off in the gap. \n\nThe pounding on the door stopped in a minute. The pounding in my chest took a while longer. I took a breath.\n\nI was in a cubicle farm. \n\nTwenty rows. Ten columns. Two hundred workstations end to end. I have had the time to count. When I first arrived, all of the monitors were synced with a screensaver and a moving logo. Some ten-pointed star with a little lion roaring behind it. When I sat down and opened up a browser, all of the other screens turned red. No words, no instructions, just… red. \n\nThere's a window in the far right corner. I hoped it would look outside. Maybe I could see the car. Maybe I could signal for help. Maybe I could just jump the fuck out at this rate. But the view looked out into another office space with an indoor courtyard at the center. All of the hinges are locked. No help.\n\nThere’s a door at the back that leads to another office. Then another. And another. I kept going until it occurred to me how easy it would be to get lost. All of the rooms look the same. There are no directions. There are no instructions. Just pure fucking madness. I saw a projection monitor in one of the hallways and almost died from happiness. Of course the damn thing doesn’t work. But the randomness of it made me hope for something better.\n\nHere’s the thing. I know I’m not alone.\n\nI can hear someone through the walls. Especially in the conference room by the kitchen. I can hear a woman crying. I can hear another one whispering. I have screamed at them until my throat feels like it’s going to bleed out. But they don't answer me. They don’t even stop saying whatever the fuck it is they’re saying. I hope they can’t hear me. The thought that they can hear me and do nothing is worse.\n\nSome of the rooms have a strange smell to them. Like old moldy fruit and vinegar. I also heard music in one of them, but it just got quiet the more I looked for the source. It sounded like old time Jazz.\n\nI read this story once. The Devil in the White City. A serial killer built a hotel with death traps in the center of Chicago right around the time of the World’s Fair. Countless people were trapped inside a meticulously designed Murderville made by a madman. The cops did nothing to help them. They didn't even catch the guy years later. I really hope this doesn’t go down that way. I don’t want to be trapped here. I don’t want to die here. I just don't know how to get out.\n\nMy phone is low on battery. I called my dad twice and he won’t answer. I don’t trust the computers here. I don't trust anything. So here’s hoping my next update is on the outside. After the nightmare is done. After it was all found to be some dumb misunderstanding.\n\nThe lights are starting to dim now. It’s time to find a safe place to sleep. \n\nI tried the staircase twice. There’s something eating inside it.",

        "text": "**WATCH ME DO CHINESE WATER TORTURE—WILL I FALL INTO PSYCHOSIS!?!**\n\nYeah. You read that right. I’m a content creator and I decided to drip water on my head for 5 hours, and livestream the entire thing.\n\nThe things we do for money, huh?\n\n“My friend Leslie here has restrained me,” I said into the camera, as the dripper hovered above me. “My hands are handcuffed behind my back, my ankles are strapped to the chair, and I am completely unable to move.”\n\nLeslie gave an awkward thumbs-up at the camera.\n\n“Did you know Chinese water torture didn’t originate in China? The earliest account is from 15th century Italy. There’s also a kinda creepy drawing from Sweden with it. Leslie, can you hold that up for them?”\n\nShe held up the drawing I’d printed out from Wikipedia, of [a murderer screaming as water dripped onto his head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_water_torture#/media/File:Palmqvist_water_torture.jpg). I grinned into the camera.\n\n“Apparently, if you do this long enough, you start hallucinating. 10 hours, and you go into psychosis. I don’t believe it. But we’ll find out, won’t we? Leslie, do the honors?”\n\nShe reached up and turned the knob.\n\nA second later I felt a cold, fat drop of water fall onto my scalp.\n\n\\-\n\n“One hour has elapsed,” I said, looking into the camera I’d placed across the room. “I feel… mostly good. The water was really annoying at first, but I’ve gotten used to it. I just wish I could dry off my face. And get out of these handcuffs.”\n\nThe metal was biting into my wrists and my left hand was asleep. But I was stuck—like an idiot, I had no backup plan.\n\nI had to wait for Leslie. Four hours to go.\n\n\\-\n\n“Hour 2. This sucks.” I nodded to my sweatshirt, which was soaked. “I’m tired. I’m cold. And—” *Drip.* Another drop of water hit me on the head, oozing into my hair.\n\n“The dripping isn’t at regular intervals, and it’s driving me *crazy*. I never know when they next one’s coming. Sometimes it drips out one, then another right after. Sometimes it waits several minutes between drips. Sometimes I hear this little gurgling noise beforehand, and then I try to get ready for it, but somehow that makes it worse, you know?”\n\nThis still wasn’t as bad as the Frosting Challenge I did last year (don’t ask), but it was starting to become very un-fun.\n\nMaybe Dad was right. Maybe, it was time for me to get a “real” job.\n\n\\-\n\n“Three hours.”\n\nI was cold. My wrists stung. And there was this pressure in my chest, a ball of anxiety, as I waited for that next godforsaken drop of water to hit me.\n\nIt was stupid—logically, I knew that. It was just water. But the repetition, and the irregularity of it. It was like listening to a ticking clock. A *broken* clock, out of rhythm, out of sync. *Tiktik-tock. Tocktick… TICK.* Sometimes I heard a soft gurgling sound and my entire body would seize up. When the drop didn’t come, I relaxed. Only for a big fat one to hit me square on the head and slowly, ever-so-slowly trickle down my face.\n\nThen it would bead there, sticking to my chin, for what felt like hours until finally breaking free and splattering onto my already-soaked sweatshirt.\n\n“I’m not hallucinating or anything,” I said. “But I’m really stressed out. I can’t remember the last time I was this stressed.” I closed my eyes and let out an anguished sigh.\n\nAnd then I remembered.\n\nI was handcuffed to the chair… but I didn’t need my hands to make a call.\n\n“Hey Google,” I shouted in the direction of my phone, sitting on the kitchen counter. “Call Leslie.”\n\nShe picked up after two rings. “Hey, Charlie? Everything okay?”\n\nRelief flooded me. Suddenly the handcuffs didn’t hurt so much; the water dripping onto my face barely made me flinch. “Yeah. Sort of. I think I’m done with this water torture thing.”\n\n“Oh, already? It’s that miserable, huh?”\n\n“Yeah. I’m freezing and sore and I just don’t think I can keep this up much longer.” *Drip—*this one hit me on my cheek, and slowly traveled down my neck like an icy finger. “Can you come over and untie me?”\n\n“I’m afraid I can’t do that.”\n\nMy stomach dropped. “Uh, what?” I asked, with a nervous laugh. “Why not?”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Leslie?”\n\nA pause.\n\n*Had the call disconnected?* I glanced at the counter—\n\nMy phone wasn’t there.\n\n*What the…* But then I remembered. Before setting up for the water torture, I’d left my phone charging upstairs. There’s no way I’d actually talked to Leslie just now.\n\n*I have to get out of here.*\n\nI violently rocked my body back and forth, trying to move the chair underneath me. If I could just get my chair a foot forward, I’d be out of the water’s range. With a grunt, I lurched forward.\n\nBut the chair barely budged.\n\n\\-\n\nThree and a half hours.\n\nI sat completely frozen in the chair. Drops of water slowly slid down my cheeks and onto my sweater, but I didn’t even blink. I wouldn’t let it get to me. *Drip—*another drop—the 107th one since the hallucination. I’d been counting them to keep my concentration, and it was working. *Gurgle—here comes 108*—\n\n*Creeeeeeaaaak.*\n\nI froze, staring towards the hallway.\n\nBut no sounds followed. I let out the breath I’d been holding and closed my eyes, trying to calm myself. Breathe in, breathe out. *In less than two hours, Leslie will be here. I just have to make it until then—*\n\nSomething cold poked against my spine.\n\nI froze as it slowly, carefully, made its way up my back. Tears burned my eyes as I resisted the urge to turn around. *It’s not real. It’s not real.*\n\nBut it felt real.\n\nIn my research of water torture I’d read about an artist in New Zealand, who’d done it as part of some art exhibit. In the final hours she said she felt the presence of her dead husband, stroking his finger up and down her back.\n\nBut the cold finger slowly moving up my spine did not feel loving. I began to sob as it passed my shoulderblades, heading towards my neck.\n\n*Drip*.\n\n\\-\n\nAlmost four hours.\n\nI heard a child laughing softly, just beyond my view in the hallway. Little pattering footsteps across the wooden floor. But when I finally saw a glimpse of it, there was something horribly off with the way it moved. Like it was something inhuman, trying to imitate human movement.\n\n*Drip.*\n\nSomething was walking behind me. I could see its shadow passing over me, stretched out on the tile floor. Cold fingers grazed my spine again, and this time when the fingers reached my neck… they squeezed.\n\n*Drip.*\n\nAnd then the most horrible one. The last one I remembered, before everything went black.\n\nThe voice started off soft, barely audible. But I recognized it instantly: my mother’s voice. She was singing Brahm’s lullaby, which she used to sing to me as a child.\n\nBefore she died, 14 years ago.\n\nThe lullaby got louder as I sat strapped to the chair, frozen. *Pleasant dreams until the dawn…* The sound moved around the house, sometimes coming from out in the hallway, sometimes from upstairs. Tears ran down my face as I listened to her sing. *Start the day, with a smile…*\n\n*Drip.*\n\nHer voice was right in my ear.\n\nI screamed. I began rocking the chair back and forth, violently. Trying to desperately escape. But the chair barely moved—\n\n*Drip.*\n\nShe was standing in front of me.\n\nI stared at her baby blue slippers on my tile floor. My gaze slowly went up… across her white nightgown… towards the face I hadn’t seen in 14 years—\n\n\\-\n\nI woke up in the hospital.\n\nLeslie’s face hung over mine, her eyes red and swollen from crying. “I was so worried about you. I thought—I thought we’d lost you…”\n\nThat night, after I returned home, I watched a replay of the livestream. I fastforwarded to the last thing I remember—around four hours into the video.\n\nI could see myself sitting on the chair. The dripper hanging above me. I watched myself scream, as I heard my mother’s voice in my ear. Then I saw my eyes slowly travel upwards… and stop about five feet off the ground, where her face would be.\n\nThen I violently turned away—\n\nAnd began bashing my head into the kitchen table.\n\nAfter several sickening *thwacks,* I could see the blood. Thick patches blooming out of my hair, running down my face. But I didn’t stop. If anything, I sped up, wildly thrashing my head into the table as hard as I possibly could—\n\nAnd then my entire body went still.\n\nI’d knocked myself unconscious.\n\nI watched in horror as I lay there, eyes closed, blood pooling out onto the table. No wonder Leslie had thought I was dead. Several minutes went by, and then I saw her run into the frame, frantically tending to me.\n\nBut then I saw something else.\n\nJust for a second. In the water pooled on the floor. A dark shape, flitting across the reflections—then vanishing from sight.\n\nMaybe there is more to water torture than we [thought.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

        "text": "Growing up, I thought it was normal that we had a closet in our house that was forbidden to be opened. My dumb kid brain thought *everyone* had a closet in their house that was triple locked, chained, and bared closed at all times. It wasn’t until I had finished bragging about how much cooler my family’s secret closet must’ve looked compared to all the other kids in second grade that I came to learn the truth. My family is weird.\n\nFor one instance, my parents named me Marmalade Dickinson. My sisters are named Hibiscus (twenty-six), Daisy (twenty-four), and Camomile (twenty-one). Yup, we’re all named after flowers. I’m the youngest at the age of twenty and for the past thirteen years of my life, I’ve been curious as to what lay behind that old oak door.\n\nNever in a million years did I think my sisters and I would find an actual skeleton in the closet. \n\nNormally we’d never even dream about breaking into the forbidden closet, so how did we come to be in this situation? Well key word here being normally. *Normally*, my sisters and I are sober, but one drunken night fueled by dumb decisions is what led to this whole dilemma.\n\nIt was the night of our parents thirtieth wedding anniversary. They wanted everyone to get together for a nice, big, family dinner together before leaving for the casino and gambling all their retirement money away. In attendance were my parents, obviously, Bit (Hibiscus), Daisy, her boyfriend Rick, Cam (Camomile), Cam’s boyfriend Noah, and myself. My boyfriend, Matthew, had other commitments so he wasn’t able to make it.\n\nThe dinner went fine as we all caught up, then we wished our parents farewell. We all decided to hang back and spend the night at our childhood home since we had all moved out by that point. \n\nEveryone had already been tipsy as they shared a few bottles of twenty dollar wine at dinner, but they broke out the hard liquor when the parentals left. I wasn’t feeling all that great so I stuck to water instead. But we had ourselves a little party, we did. \n\nIt was Noah who suggested we play truth or dare in the first place. We were just chilling in the living room with some action movie playing in the background when he randomly brought it up.\n\n“Ugh, I’m bored! We should play a game. What about truth or dare?”\n\n“I’m down.” Cam replied as she snuggled into her man’s shoulder, lovingly.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders, too invested in the current plot point of the movie, not really listening.\n\nBit agreed as she broke up Daisy and Rick’s make out session. The two, now back in the real world, also agreed.\n\n“I’ll go first!” Daisy volunteered. “Rick, I dare you to kiss me.”\n\nRick chuckled and smirked before laying a big fat one on her puckered cheeks. I groaned and rolled my eyes. “That’s not even how you play. You have to actually ask the question truth or dare?”\n\n“Thanks little sis, but I know how to play truth or dare. God, you’re such a buzzkill Mar,” she scoffed. “Ricky, truth or dare?”\n\n“Uhhh, dare.”\n\n“Okay, I dare you to kiss me.”\n\nRick and Daisy began to make out intensely. My lovely older sister flipped me the finger while they did tongue. I pretended to gag in my mouth.\n\nCam got off of her boyfriend’s chest. “Alright, that's enough PDA from you two tonight.” \n\nThe two lovers stopped kissing and cuddled instead. \n\n“Can I have a turn?” Bit asked Noah. He nodded his head.\n\n“Alright… Cam! Truth or dare?”\n\n“Truth.”\n\n“Did you steal my last cigarette?”\n\nCam twiddled her thumbs while she thought on her answer. “Yeah, sorry.”\n\nBit shot Cam a smug smile. “I fucking knew it was you!”\n\n“Listen, I was out okay? You still had one left and it was right there, taunting me,” Camomile replied defensively. “I said I was sorry.”\n\n“Yeah whatever,” Hibiscus replied, not buying it. “You owe me a new pack of smokes.”\n\n“Fair.” Cam replied with a shrug.\n\n“Ok my turn!” Noah said as he rubbed his hands together excitedly. He looked around the room, looking for his prey, when his brown eyes landed on me. “Mar, truth or dare?”\n\n“Hmm.” I hummed as I pointed my finger on my chin. Spill a juicy truth or do a fun dare? I chose the latter.\n\n“Dare, and make it a good one.” I say, feeling adventurous.\n\n“Alright then,” Noah said cheekily as he accepted my challenge,” I dare you to open the closet. That’s right, *the* closet.”\n\nThe room went into a stunned silence. All of our significant others, except for Bit’s since she was single, knew of the closet. Of course they were always intrigued about the closet’s contents, but knew better than to pry. \n\nMy heart sank to my stomach. I didn’t think I’d be able to do this dare. My whole life I’ve been forbidden from opening the closet, not to mention how much effort would go into opening the thing. My sisters and I didn’t even want to begin to think of the consequences of opening that door growing up. It was simply never an option, and yet there I was, given an impossible dare.\n\nHibiscus, Daisy, and Camomile all stared at me intently. I felt a few beads of sweat start to slide down my face from the pressure as Noah stared at me, awaiting my answer. \n\n“Fuck it.” Was all I said before getting off the couch and heading for the closet, which was located downstairs in our basement (I know, triple the creep factor, am I right?).  A dare was a dare and I wasn’t going to pussy out.\n\nMy sisters and their boyfriends eagerly followed me, hyping me up to see if I’d actually do it. In no time I was facing the ominous door. It felt like it  towered over my five foot frame, but in reality it was only like a foot taller than me. \n\nI took a step closer, wrapping my hands around the heavy piece of wood that was bared across the door.\n\n“A little help here?” I asked, struggling to lift the wood. \n\n“Nuh-uh. No way. Your ass is grass when mom and dad find out you opened the closet.” Bit said as she watched me struggle. Cam stared at me, amused.\n\n“It won’t ever be opened if I could lift this damn piece of wood!” I retorted back, frustrated. \n\nRick finally stepped in to help. “Here.” \n\nWith our combined efforts, mainly Rick’s, we got the first obstacle off the door. I then unraveled the chains that were crisscrossed around the door. All that was left were the three locks, which can only be locked from the inside. Of course neither of us had the key. Our dad always had the thing in his possession.\n\n“Quick, Bit, give me two of your bobbie pins!” I said, thinking quickly on my feet. My sister fumbled with her long, artificially dyed, blue hair that she’d put up into a bun before retrieving the hair pins. She handed them to me.\n\n“What exactly are you going to do with that, Mar?” Cam asked me.\n\n“Isn’t it obvious?” I replied back as I bent the pins straight.\n\n“She’s going to lock-pick the locks, duh!” Daisy replied in a mocking tone. \n\nCam just scoffed and rolled her eyes. “Yeah, no shit Sherlock. What I meant was, what’s Mar going to do? She can’t pick a lock to save her life.”\n\nI jammed the bobbie pins into the first lock before poking one around while keeping the other steady. A second later the first lock unlocked with a satisfying click.\n\n“What was that?” I asked, coyly.\n\nI smirked at the astonished look on Cam’s face. “Where the hell did you learn to pick a lock?!”\n\n“A magician never reveals her secrets.” I said with a wink before moving on to the second lock. In reality, Bit taught me one night when we were bored. She taught herself how to pick a lock so she could sneak into the liquor cabinet our parents had.\n\nNot even a minute later and all three locks had been disengaged. I had wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans before putting my hand on the handle and twisting it open. It was nerve wracking just imagining all the possibilities that could’ve laid behind that door. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the smell. It was warm and stale, but had the slightest hint of decay.\n\nI had to blink twice and rub my eyes to make sure I was seeing things right. “A-are you guys seeing this too?”\n\n“If you mean a person's skeleton, then yes.” Daisy said despondently.\n\nI turned to look behind me. Everyone stared in shock at the skeleton. It still had bits of dry, leathery, skin still clinging to it, but mostly the flesh had decayed and flaked off.  The person must’ve been a girl going by the pink floral dress it was wearing. That wasn’t the eeriest part though. The backside of the door had scratch marks all up and down it, which meant the person most likely died in there trying to claw their way out. There were also these little symbols painted in white all over the walls and even the door, painted over the scratch marks. The symbols looked like little runes meant to keep something in… or something out.\n\n“Jesus Christ!” Bit yelled as she brought her hand to her mouth.\n\nNoah didn’t say anything and just booked it up the stairs.\n\n“Noah, wait!” Cam yelled after him. In a last second motion, I grabbed her wrist.\n\n“W-whatever you do, make sure he doesn’t call the police.” \n\n“Marmalade, I-“ she hesitated as she looked between the basement stairs and the skeleton in the closet.\n\n“Just make sure, ok!” I yelled frantically. With that Camomile flew up the stairs after her boyfriend.\n\nI quickly grabbed the closet door and slammed it shut, sliding my back down against it. I lowered my head into my knees.\n\n“W-what are we going to do?” Bit asked.\n\n“There’s got to be a reasonable explanation as to why that’s in there.” I conclude.\n\n“There’s a dead body that’s been locked in that closet for who knows how long!” Rick yelled. “If your parents have been guarding that rotting corpse all these years, there’s only one logical conclusion as to how that person got trapped in there!”\n\n“We’ve got to call the police!” Daisy shouted, agreeing with her boyfriend.\n\n“On Mom and Dad?” I questioned hysterically. “No way! Daisy, you know they’d never hurt a fly!” \n\n“Then how would you explain that? They’ve got a point, Mar.” Bit chimed in.\n\n“Bit you’re the oldest!” Daisy exclaimed. “What do you think we should do? I- I’m at my wits end here.”\n\n“Me? Why are you asking me that?!? So what if I’m the oldest! I’m not the one that put that down here!”\n\nAs the three started fighting amongst each other in the chaos of the situation, I stood up and came to a decision. I opened the door, getting one last good look at the skeleton. I slid my finger along some of the scratch marks, accidentally chipping the paint from one of the symbols off, before reengaging the locks. I then slid the chains back in place, and somehow found the strength to put the piece of wood back over the door.\n\n“Mar, what are you doing?” Bit asked after taking notice of my actions.\n\n“Nobody is calling the police. At least not until we get Mom and Dads side of the story.” I announce. “We can figure out where to go from there, but until then, the skeleton stays put.”\n\n“Yeah like that’ll bode well.” Daisy scoffed. “Hey Mom, Dad! We went into the forbidden closet you told us to never enter and found skeletal remains. Care to explain?” \n\nBit took a step towards me,” Maybe she’s right, we should wait until we have heard mom and dads side of the story.”\n\nSuddenly, Cam came barreling down the stairs. “Noah isn’t going to call the police, but he left to go clear his head. We’re going to meet back up at our place.”\n\nBit then informed Cam of the plan. \n\n“I’m telling you, this isn’t going to go the way you’re expecting, Marmalade.” Daisy said as she waved us all off. “But whatever, I’m going home.”\n\nRick and Bit both followed her upstairs since they all lived together and drove here in the same vehicle. \n\n“I better get out of here too.” Cam said before making her way back up the stairs.\n\nThen it was just me, all alone in the basement, with the skeleton in the closet.\n\n*I’ll figure something out. An opportunity is bound to present itself.* I’d thought to myself as I made my way upstairs too. I stared at the bottom of the menacing basement stairs before turning the light off and closing the door. \n\n*** \n\nLuckily I didn’t have to wait long for said opportunity, in fact, my parents were the ones that called the family meeting.\n\nIt was the morning after, about eleven am, when I was awoken by my phone buzzing. After rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, I checked the caller ID and found it was my father. After picking up, all he told me to do was go to their house for an emergency family meeting. I reluctantly agreed, remembering the previous night’s events. \n\nWithin twenty minutes, fighting off dizziness and fatigue just thinking about the night before, I was dressed and out the door. I was the last one to arrive. My mother had prepared brunch. The meal sat on the dining room table as my parents, Hibiscus, Daisy, and Camomile sat in their respective seats. \n\n“Glad you could join us.” My father said unsuspectingly.\n\nI nodded my head as I sat down next to Cam. “Thanks for brunch Mom, it looks delicious.”\n\n“You’re welcome dear.” Was all she said.\n\n“H-how was the casino?” Cam asked, nervously.\n\nInstead of responding, my father prompted us girls to start eating. All three of us reluctantly did. Eventually my parents started eating too. \n\nI was so sick from the nervousness, waiting for the other shoe to drop, that I barely touched my plate. Daisy looked way too hungover and pissy to be dealing with this shit so early in the morning. I could tell she just wanted to get back to bed.\n\n“You know,” my father started after the tension in the room crescendoed into a fortissimo,”our family hasn’t always been the brightest or the best, but we’d do anything for each other, right?” \n\nA murmur of yeses filled the room as we all stared at our plates. They knew something was up. Parents always know somehow.\n\n“Good. It’s good to know that.” He took a bite out of one of the biscuits my mother made. “Now listen girls, I’m about to tell you a story. I want each and every one of you to pay attention, alright?”\n\nWe all nod our heads. My mother clears her throat and adjusts herself uncomfortably. \n\n“The ‘accident’ where my parents, brothers and sister died, your grandparents, aunt, and uncles, was not an accident.” My father confessed.\n\nThe room went eerily silent as we all processed his words. Growing up they told us his family passed away in a tragic car accident. My mother once admitted he felt guilty that he had been staying over at a friend's house when it happened, and that he should’ve been with them. We grew up in my fathers family’s home, so we’ve seen our grandparents, aunt, and uncles photos. So growing up we knew who they were and what their fates were, but now he’s telling us that was all a lie?\n\n“My mother had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. And like I said earlier, my father would’ve done anything for my mother, including selling his soul to a demon.”\n\nHe said it with such seriousness, but I had to try really hard to hold in my laugh. Selling your soul to a demon? People can’t possibly think that’s a real thing they can do, right?!?\n\n“You can’t be serious.” I heard Bit whisper under her breath.\n\n“Extremely.” My dad replied, glaring at my oldest sister.\n\n“Again, my family wasn’t the brightest. My parents somehow gathered the right information and ingredients to summon a demon and when it showed itself, they made a deal. The demon agreed to cure my mother of her disease and my father shook on it immediately before even hearing the other part of the deal. He believed he sold his soul. Instantly my mother was cured of her cancer. Then the demon revealed what he wanted. It wanted a soul alright, but not my dads. It wanted the soul of one of their children. The demon wanted my parents to kill one of my siblings or I in exchange for my mothers life.”\n\nI brought my hands to my gaping mouth. My breath hitched in my throat. What a horrible thing! I felt a tear fall from my eye. There’s no way any of what he was saying was real! This all had to be one sick joke on my parents part! But my dad… he was being so stoic and serious, the complete opposite of the wise-guy I know who was always cracking jokes. \n\nMy mother buried her face in her palms as she silently sobbed. What they were saying, it couldn’t be true, could it?\n\nMy father took a second to collect himself. “Upon learning what the demon wanted, my father and mother both refused. My mother begged the demon to give the cancer back to her, but once a demon has started a deal, they can’t go back on it. Because my parents refused to murder one of their children a curse was unleashed upon our bloodline. First my father died from a sudden stroke. Then my oldest brother, Tommy, got hit by a truck on his way home from school.”\n\nA pained expression filled my fathers face as he recollected the tragic events. When he closed his eyes, it seemed like he was back, relieving the moment. Yet he pressed on,”Our mother broke down and told us the truth, but It wasn’t until we saw a dark shadow take Tommy’s body away that we believed her. Not long after we figured out the pattern, but to be sure, we had to use my other brother, Fenris, as the test subject. When he came down with a terrible flu a few days later my sister and I knew. The Demon was killing us from oldest to youngest, but couldn’t move on to the next victim until it had the body of the previous.”\n\nMy mind went a bit hazy as I processed everything my dad was telling us. I felt unbelievably queasy and got up when I felt vomit make its way up my throat. I hacked what little brunch I had eaten into the kitchen sink.\n\nMy mother came to check on me and walked me back to my seat with a wet compress on my forehead. She handed me a water bottle before going back to her seat. My father shot me a sympathetic look before continuing with his story. \n\n“While Fenris continued to decline, my sister, Rosy, and I found the spell book my father used to summon the demon. We found protective runes in it and decided to create a warded chamber that would protect the body of the last victim. If the demon didn’t have the body, the curse couldn’t progress. On the night Rosy and I finally finished getting the wards ready, we slipped into Fenris’s room and drug him downstairs to the basement. I can still remember the feeling of his cold sweaty palms in mine as I tugged his delirious body down the stairs. Unfortunately for us, he had grown too weak and the strenuous activity of dragging his limp body down the stairs was too much for his heart. He died of a heart attack at the bottom of the stairs.”\n\nMy father wiped a tear that had escaped from his eye. Another one fell, but he didn’t bother to wipe it away. He was squeezing my mothers hand for comfort now. “Rosy and I grieved for our brother and sobbed in each other's arms. The demon was quick to move onto the next victim. Rosy, being younger than Fen but  older than me, started suffering from an asthmatic attack, spurred on by our sobbing. Thinking quickly, I grabbed her free arm and made a run for the basement. Rosy was too busy scratching at her throat to notice I’d shoved her into the closet we turned into a protective tomb. When she started scraping at the closet door, begging for air, I almost broke and let her die in my arms. I was young then, too young to care about my fate. The only thing I knew was that my family was dying. That thought is what kept me going. I realized that she was going to die no matter what, but there was still a chance to save myself, save what was left of my family. Back then it was just a simple lock on the closet that I turned with ease. But now, as you’ve seen it, I keep that closet heavily locked and hard to get to.” \n \nDaisy broke out into a sob with Cam joining her. Hibiscus tried to comfort the both of them. I tried to keep from puking again. \n\n“Obviously I’m still here, so that means our plan worked. That just left my mother and I to guard the closet with our lives. That is until she killed herself. She couldn’t bear the loss of her husband and three oldest children and was guilt ridden that she made it out alive. Since she was cured of her cancer, she found another way out. A bottle of bourbon and my dads revolver. Now it’s just me and it’s been my job to keep that closet locked and protected for the past forty-three years.”\n\n“How do you know all this?” Daisy asked, wiping a tear from her face.\n\n“Because the demon showed me a vision. Once it learned I had outsmarted it, it taunted me with the truth.”\n\nOut of the million racing through my brain, I asked my first question. “How did you know we went into the closet in the first place?”\n\nMy father took another bite of his biscuit and chased it down with some water before pulling out his keyring. He twirled it around his finger. “I check to make sure my sister is still in there three times a day.”\n\nThat answer chilled me to the bone. I could tell it shocked my sisters too. \n\n“Listen, your mother and I are not mad.” He took the last big bite of his biscuit as my mother nodded in agreement. “In fact, I understand that you all *cough* might be confused as to what you’ve found, hence why I’ve told you this story today.” \n\nHe took another sip of his water. “So please, just tell me where you girls moved the body. *cough. cough.*”\n\nI furrowed my eyebrows in confusion. I left the forbidden closet just as I had found it last night. None of us, that I know of, moved the body. Hell we wouldn’t have wanted to touch the skeleton if we wanted to! “Dad, what are you talking about? We didn’t move the body.”\n\nI quickly stood from my chair and marched towards my father. I ripped the keyring out of his hands and marched for the basement door. Bit and Daisy got up to follow me as my father continued in his little coughing fit.\n\nBit helped me move the piece of wood off over the fortified door and Daisy removed the chains as we set the wood down. I used the key to unlock the locks and pulled the door open.\n\nA loud thud came from above us. “Quick call nine-one-one!” My mother screamed.\n\nI took a step back, fighting the urge to pass out. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The closet was empty and the skeleton was gone.\n\nAt first I thought it was my vision going hazy from shock, but I knew it was something in the corporeal world when Bit let out a small shriek. A dark ominous shadow appeared out of nowhere, and I’m fairly certain that it belonged to the demon that cursed our bloodline.",

        "text": "I visited my grandpa this summer during holidays. I have never been particularly close to him, but my mom said that it would be good way to detox from the city fumes (my grandpa lives in the countryside). I agreed, since I remember hanging in the lake nearby his house and watching the fireflies at night.\n\nI arrived after a couple of hours travelling by bus, then I walked about ten minutes to my grandpa's house. It was a silent wood house; mom said he used his lifetime savings to built it and now he lives from his retirement money and the earnings from his delivery company.\n\nI said hi to my grandpa, who said I looked much older than he remembered me. I hadn't seen him since I was 12  (I'm 19 now) so I get why he told me that. I went upstairs and started unpacking, since I was going to stay for a couple of  weeks. I noticed that there was a thick, but still a small sized book in my bedside table. It was an old compendium of religious songs and catholic prayers. Out of curiosity, I opened the book and some of the songs and prayers titles were crossed out, and they were some pages ripped away from the book. I always knew my grandpa was a little bit weird, since he had some particular interests, but this felt a little bit disturbing.\n\nAround 9 pm, I walked downstairs in my pajamas and with the book on my hand. I found him reading the newspaper in the kitchen. \n\n\"Hey, grandpa, I was looking at the book that is next to the bed and I wonder, why are some of the titles crossed out?\" I asked him. His face changed from relaxed to a worried expression. \n\nGrandpa closed his eyes and left the newspaper in the table. He took a deep breath and finally talked to me again.\n\n\"Follow me to the living room, son\".\n\nI didn't realized when I first entered the house, but now I looked carefully at the walls in the living room and there were at least 10 different crucifixes hanging there. I'm not sure if it was because of my grandpa's seriousness but I felt a chill down my spine. \n\nMy grandpa sit on his chair and told me to grab one from the kitchen. I took one and sit in front of him. After a couple seconds, he started talking in a serious and low tone.\n\n\"What I am about to tell you, I have only tell it to your mother and your grandma. It is a very delicate story and I don't like to share it so lightly. But I am trusting you because I don't want anything happen to you.\n\nThis happened to me when I was 25 years old. My parents had just started the delivery company in our town and I worked there to help the company grow. We started delivering around the town, but some months later I started to deliver some items to 6 or 7 towns a couple of miles around. We didn't have any cars so I did the deliveries on our old horse named Louie. \n\nOne summer evening, my mom told me that the doctor from a nearby town called saying he needed with urgency some medicine, so she asked me if I could go. It was about 11 pm and it was foggy outside, so my dad (who was shortsighted) couldn't do the trip. I accepted, basically because mom promised me that the next day she would took me to the movies. \n\nI took the medicines and I was leaving the house when my dad stopped me.\n\n'Son, take care please'\n\n'Don't worry dad, it's just fog'\n\n'I'm not talking about that' he said concerned. 'The countryside on the night it's dangerous. We don't know what kind of evil is wandering around'.\n\nI ignored him because I thought the most dangerous thing I could found was a snake or maybe a coyote. Louie was old, but surprisingly fast, so if he saw any danger, he would run until we have escaped of whatever would be in the darkness.\n\nThe trip to the town was in a desertic road, only surrounded by the corn plantations and some mountains far away. I ride for almost half an hour and my town lights were non visible anymore. The fog was so thick that the road lights almost didn't illuminate anything. I wasn't particularly scared, but I made sure to look around once in a while to see if any robbers or a savage animal was hiding in the fog. \n\nSuddenly I found a woman. She was dressed in a long white dress. The long sleeves were dirty and she was barefoot. She looked tired and was walking really slow. I stopped Louie because I though she might need some help. \n\n'Ma'am, are you all right?' I asked. \n\nShe ignored me at first, but I talked to her again thinking she might have not hear me.\n\n'Do you need a ride?'  \n\nShe turned around her head and looked me in the eyes. I swallowed hard while looking at her face. It looked normal, but it was very dirty and he eyes where wide open. Her eyelashes and eyebrows were gone, and her nose had one single drop of dark blood.\n\nIt was a summer night but it started to freeze all of a sudden. Louie was very uneasy, with a fast breathing and started pulling his reins. The woman started to aproach with the same unexpressive face, with slow and robotic steps. She didn't looked human.\n\n'I need help' she said in a low and dry voice. \n\nShe touched Louie with her hand right in the neck and started petting him. Louie had stopped moving around, but he was shaking with fear at the moment she touched him. In all my years with that horse I have never seen him like that. \n\nI was scared, but my dad always said that no matter how someone might look, as good catholics, we always have to help them. I doubted, but I finally decided that I must help her. What if she was attacked and she was in shock? Maybe she had some mental illness and is feeling disoriented. I couldn't help myself and I offered my help.\n\n'I'll take you to the closest town, the people there can help you' I said while lending my hand to her.\n\n'Thanks, young man' she said. She took my hand and it felt like I was touching ice. Her hand was so cold that almost hurt mine. And she was heavy. She looked small and thin, but helping her to ride Louie was almost like lifting a grown man. Louie started walking again, slower because of the extra weight.\n\nShe grabbed me by the waist and supported her face in my back. The aura that she emmited was very heavy and hostile, but I tried to ignore this and remind me that we were 5 minutes from the town. I would leave her in the police station and deliver the medicines. Then I would ride back home and everything would be all right.\n\n'Why are you alone so late at night?' the woman interrumpted my thoughts with her voice. But her tone was quite different. It was as spectral as always, but it felt like she had some real interest in me.\n\n'I'm delivering medicines in the town we're going. There are some sick people over there' I said. \n\n'You're taking the medicines for the ill?' Her question was kinda silly, but her tone changed completely. She was more defiant and hostile.\n\n'Yes... I am doing that'\n\n'Why are you doing that?'\n\n'Because they need this medicines to survive'\n\n'Oh young man, they're already dead' she said in a laught.\n\nThere was a silence for a couple of seconds. I could only hear Louie's gallops and the silent laughter of the woman. She was still grabbing my waist, and was squeezing my abdomen more every second.\n\n'Why-Why do you said that?' I stuttered.\n\n'They're dead just as you wil be' she answered.\n\n'I don't understand what do you mean by that'\n\nThere was a silence again. I didn't wanted to turn to my back, I was to scared to even make Louie accelerate and to push the lady over even though I wanted to do that. \n\nLouie started to slow down. I thought he might have stepped on a rock and twisted his ankle so I decided to take a look down. My blood froze in that instant.\n\n'I think you do understand why I am saying what I am saying' she said in an demonic, horrible voice.\n\nLouie's legs were fine, but we were losing speed because there was something slowing us down. Two long, skeletic white legs where hanging from where the woman was sit. The legs had some awful looking cuts and were bleeding a lot. They were so long they touched the ground and were acting like anchors. \n\nMy heart was beating like crazy when she.... no, it started laughing in a demonic voice. Her hands became claws and began to go through my body like small knives. I could feel strings of blood coming out of my belly. Louie was trying to speed up with despair. \n\n'You know who I am, don't you?' it said right next to my ear. Its breath was horrible, like a sewage leak and rotten eggs. \n\nTears started to come out of my eyes in a mixture of pain and fear. I could only start praying the Out Father, to feek protection. The demon laughed so maniacally that I couldn't help to pray louder.\n\n'Don't waste your last breaths in praying, young man, I already knew that!' he spitted at my ear.\n\nI switched prayers to the Holy Mary, the Creed, so many other church songs and nothing worked. The demon was still laughing harder and harder. Its laugh was so noisy, my eardrums started to hurt badly. \n\n'I already knew that one! I already know them all!' screamed at me every time I said another prayer. Its claws were ripping my skin off my belly and was starting to climb to my chest. Louie was getting tired and his breathing was very agitated. \n\n'When the horse stops, I will rip you apart and destroy your insides!'\n\nI started crying and screaming. I didn't know what to do. Its long tongue licked my tears with delight. The tongue was rough, like a cat tongue, but it was pointy and was cutting my face as well.\n\n'I will enjoy this, you taste better with all this fear! Hahahah!' \n\nThen I remembered, my mom and I used to sing a song before sleeping when I was little. She wrote it to teach me to pray at least once a day. I tried to compose myself and started singing, picturing my mom and I singing in the same bed.\n\nMy voice was cracking and I couldn't pronounce correctly much of the words, but the demon stopped laughing. I realized this and kept singing faster and with a clear louder voice. The demons claws retracted and left my belly. Louie gained speed and its tongue wasn't in my face anymore.\n\nI finished the song. Louie stopped completely exhausted. I still felt the presence in my back, but it wasn't touching me anymore. Finally it speaked with that horrible voice again, but it didn't laugh or screamed. It sounded defeated.\n\n'All right, young man, you win. I didn't knew that one'.\n\nThen the cold feeling and that evil aura disappeared from the atmosphere. I relaxed my body and put one hand in my belly, trying to cover my bleeding wounds. Louie ran to the town, where I passed out immediately. \n\nAccording to my parents, a neighbour who was in the town saw my injures and took me back home, where I slept for 12 hours. The next day when they asked me what have happened to me, I said that an eagle had attacked me. My parents believed me, but I never told them what happened to me or that the song saved my life that night. \n\nI have this book since that day. I woke up and started to cross all the songs and prayers I said to the demon that night, in order to remember which ones are useless against it if I happen to meet it again\".\n\nMy grandpa aproached to me and put one hand in my shoulder.\n\n\"I know that you're generation are not believers, but try memorizing a couple of the good ones, it might save your life one day\" he said and went back to the kitchen.\n\nI sat there, in shock. But I decided to ask an important question. \n\n\"Grandpa wait\", he turned around. \"But how was the song you sang that night?\"\n\nMy grandpa smiled at me and said one last thing before going back to the kitchen.\n\n\"There's no point on me telling it to you. Now he knows that one too\"",

        "text": "Have you ever watched yourself consume a living, breathing human being, piece by piece? \n\nBefore a few days ago, I certainly hadn’t.\n\nIt was Friday night and I appeared to be peeling long strips off his forearm, chewing messily as rivulets of blood dribbled down the sides of my mouth and along the seams of the vinyl booth.\n\nThat night, we were a 24-hour fast-food restaurant.\n\nHe was caught up in its illusion at the time – the thing impersonating me. He wouldn’t have attempted to leave, even if booth he was sitting in hadn’t already been growing into his flesh to the point where the two were nearly indistinguishable. Even if his legs didn’t end in jagged stumps of gnawed bones instead of feet. He was alive, but barely. Already too far gone for our help. \n\nI’m not even sure how many lives it has claimed over the years – the bodies don’t exactly pile up; They disappear, pulled into the walls, the floor. Every inch of this place is built upon death.\n\nI’ve seen some people absorbed both by the surfaces of the building itself, and others eaten by the creature that dwells inside.  That was the first time it had ever looked like me while doing so, though. \n\nIt could’ve made it quick, but it rarely does. At first, I used to think of it in terms of a something feral and wild. Not evil, just hungry.\n\nI’ve since learned otherwise – it seems to genuinely revel in the fear, the pain, of its victims.\n\nIt could’ve simply taken him while I was gone and I’d never have been the wiser, but no. It made sure he suffered and it made sure I was there to see it.\n\nThe man’s right forearm was nothing but bits of muscle attached to wet bones at that point, yet he kept trying to paw at the already soggy fries in front of him, the movement of each slick muscle visible. \n\nThere wasn’t enough left of him to scream, but when he saw me, his eyes met mine, pain and realization dawning in them. He started to panic and struggle, and through his stare there was a desperate request I could not entirely read, but perhaps it was one for a faster exit from this world. \n\nIt seems to enjoy restoring their awareness once its far too late to save them.\n\nBefore I could even attempt to help him, it pulled the rest of him into the fleshy portion of the building that had been masquerading as a vinyl booth. He wasn’t dead though – not yet. \n\nIt will eat away at him for days, maybe weeks, maybe longer. I can still hear the others sometimes, those it took long before I even worked here. They ask me for help, for a reprieve, for things I cannot give them.\n\nThat Friday, I knew something was wrong the moment it began to warp the building in such a way that my return trip from the short hallway leading from the back room took 55 minutes. The hall narrowed and stretched on for what seemed like forever. At one point, the ceiling and walls began to creep in on me and became so tight that I could feel the fleshy texture that looked like brick and tile – until you looked closely –  as it slowly squeezed the air from my lungs. It let up right as spots began to dance across my vision. It can’t kill us – the creature itself can’t even touch us – the ritual sees to that, but that doesn’t stop it from tormenting us. When I’d finally made it back to what at that time was a dining room, it grinned at me with my own gore stained face, still eating, bits of gristle still in its teeth.\n\nThe worst part? The whole time, while I was crawling back through the shifting corridor and being squeezed like a human tube of toothpaste, I realized that someone must have wandered in. Helpless to do anything about it, I knew it was using that bought time to entrap our guest, and I knew that every minute I was gone, the higher the likelihood that they’d never leave this place again.\n\nI’d gone back there looking for my manager, Grady, and he wasn’t even there. We lost someone on my watch, for nothing. \n\nI’ve never worked anywhere like this before, and sometimes, I wish I’d never found the place at all.\n\nSome nights, the building is a restaurant, others a retail store. Those seem to be the most common, but once, it had even become a library. Out of curiosity I had picked up a book, it was that same fleshy texture as the walls, the floor, everything else in this living place, and written in a language I’d never seen before. It did have pictures though, and after what I saw – well, let’s just say, I’ll never sleep with the lights off again.\n\nThere used to be three people that worked here, then two. Then, just Grady before I came along. We work thirteen hours a day, seven days a week, so we’ve got an hour overlap each day. The long shifts and constant vigilance required really take a lot out of you, though. Makes it easier to slip up.\n\nI had a couple of days when I was out sick, and Grady covered for me, 48 hours straight. I promised I’d make it up to him – he works so hard, I wish he could take a break.\n\nI’m not proud to say it, but Friday wasn't the first time a loss had happened on my watch. \n\nJust days before, I'd been late and walked into Grady slowly and solemnly mopping away. That time, the victim was clearly already deceased. The body was picked clean, even the smaller and more delicate bones were already gone, the floor beginning to meld onto what remained, pulling the body downward. It had worked fast this time, a mercy not often granted to the other victims. The creature was nowhere to be seen – already moved to hunt elsewhere. \n\nI still wonder if it would have made a difference if I’d been there on time that day. I think it would have.\n\nOf all the deaths, that one hit me the hardest.\n\nGrady was nowhere to be seen when I went to say goodbye – headed out, I’d assumed at that the time. I had been trying to make up for my absence, going out of my way to clean, zealously trying sure no one else met the same fate, despite the building moving the doors around faster than I could keep up with. I was emptying what at the time was the trash when I saw it – a half-empty bag of chips with a note, from me, to Grady. His favorite kind. I didn't remember buying it – in general we try to avoid leaving any food or drinks around, it’s safer that way, but didn’t think much of it at the time.\n\nI should’ve known something wasn’t right, because in the days leading up to the deaths, it was unusually smug.\n\nBefore that, things were fairly calm for a while. We'd have the occasional person wander in, lost, confused, while simultaneously insistent that this place – although it hadn't been known to them hours mere hours before – was always their destination, but we were usually able to prevent them from making the fatal mistake.\n\nNot many people can find the place. The complex and monthly tasks my employer refers to as ‘the ritual’ seems to keep the majority of the population away. I'd started here in time to see the tail end of one, but it was a lot to take in and the initial pieces occurred before my first day. I was supposed to watch Grady and learn the rest of it this month.\n\nI’m glad they’ve been able to hide this place for the most part. It draws people like – what’s that saying? Moths to a flame? I read recently why moths gather around light – it disrupts something within them, makes them unable to navigate. That’s the impact that this place, that its single full-time resident, seems to have on people. For those that can see it, it draws you to it, confuses you into thinking that this is exactly where you were supposed to be, whatever it wants you to do, was your goal the entire time.\n\nThose of us that it can’t disorient, that see the place for what it is, we get recruited to try and help those that it can manipulate. I don’t know what brought this place or its lone inhabitant here to our town, I just work here – literally. I’m not even entirely sure who I work for –  I know my supervisor Grady, but I mean the people at the very top. \n\nOne particularly rough day, I was told, this place was a small ranch style home, an average slice of suburbia. Those that wandered in claimed they were visiting a close friend (unperturbed by the fact that they couldn’t recall their friend’s name or anything else about them). It would offer them a trinket, food, a drink. Some of those that accepted would meet a swift end. The particularly unlucky ones would find themselves slowly being absorbed into the walls, the sofa, the floors. Pulled into a wet and suffocating embrace until they too became fuel for this living nightmare. So many people came in that day – and never left – that the building nearly doubled in size.\n\nI’ve never seen its true form – it always resembles a person, though it never gets the movements quite right, they're too jerkily, almost as if it’s buffering – it’s surreal and a dead give away. The other indication is the constant look of thinly veiled hatred: it absolutely despises us, Grady and I. I don't blame it – if we didn't do our jobs, it’d have an easy and endless stream of meals. \n\nIf it could have eaten us, it would have done so a very long time ago, but as long as we do not violate the one single rule – do not accept anything it gives you – it cannot take us.\n\nIf you do accept an offering or gift, it is then owed something in return. This rule is so deeply ingrained in its existence that even the ritual cannot save those who violate it, and it typically collects on this IOU the moment it becomes hungry. It seems to always be hungry.\n\nFor the past few days, it had watched me from mere inches away, unusually smug. When its eyes met mine I'd see a twisted look of satisfaction on its face, the taunting challenge of something lethal inviting you to come just a bit closer.\n\nThe way it had been eyeing me lately was an unwelcome reminder humans are not at the top of the food chain.\n\nI was getting worried because Grady had also been acting strangely over the past few shifts – burn out, and you’re nearly guaranteed to make a mistake. \n\nHe'd solemnly nod at me on our brief overlaps, but otherwise shuffled around, never even in the same room as it when he was supposed to be watching it.\n\nI realized that his car hadn’t moved it for street cleaning days earlier and had begun to gather a coat of dirt and pollen, a thick wedge of leaves had formed behind the wheels.\n\nJust a day ago, he left an envelope claiming to hold a bonus check within, on my purse. I’ve never heard of or received a bonus check the entire time I’d worked there. I did not take it, just gingerly moved it, and took my things.\n\nI texted him to ask him if he was okay, but he never wrote back. I think Grady is gone, maybe has been for a while.\n\nI was getting ready for work when I got the text from my sister, gushing over wanting to try this new seafood place that had opened up in town. I don’t get out much since I spend so much of my time at that place; I wasn’t alarmed at first that a new establishment had popped up without me knowing. \n\nUntil she told me the cross streets it was on.\n\nShe’d never mentioned the building before. But now, she could see it.\n\nI drove to work far faster than I was legally permitted to and when I pulled up, there was a line of people wrapping around the block. The building was massive, had gone from having one story, to three. A fleshy layer that spread just beyond the door outside like a living carpet had already begun fusing with those that stood on it, while they seemed oblivious. \n\nI can’t remember the last time Grady’s car had moved – was it before the ritual was supposed to be performed? Or after?\n\nI never learned how to perform the first half on my own, and nothing I’ve found online has worked. Performing the second half alone does not work. I don’t know how to reach my employers.\n\n The doors are wide open, and people keep funneling in –  ignoring my pleas.\n\nI saw a glimpse of it through the doors and once it spotted me, it carelessly let the person it had been pulling into pieces fall to the ground and headed my direction with that jerky gait and a twisted smile. \n\nA smile that said, finally.\n\nI realized something, watching the fate of the patrons that filed or were unfortunate enough to even stand too close –  It’s not waiting for someone to accept a gift from it anymore, it hunts freely and without limitations.\n\nAt this rate the entire town will be gone in a week if not sooner.\n\nI don’t know what to do. It’s still unable to pass beyond the doors, but what if it’s only a matter of time before that stops working, [too?](https://www.reddit.com/r/JamFranz/)",

        "text": "What I’m writing now is 100% real and I’m breaking every promise in my non-disclosure agreement with the US Government. It’s actually called the 18 USC 1905,  or the \"Disclosure of confidential information generally\" form, and you can look it up to confirm the language in it.\n\nThere were also other forms signed and pledges made, but you get the idea, no one wants what I know out there in the world. I had to agree to all these restrictions like everyone else working on Plum Island in 2008.\n\nYou might remember Plum Island from that movie “Silence of the Lambs”, it’s the spot Clarice falsely promises Hannibal Lecter will be transferred to if he helps her find the serial killer. It’s not some made up Hollywood location, but a real place, as real as the horrific memories I have from working there. \n\nLocated about a mile off the tip of Long Island, it was originally where the government studied deadly agricultural diseases. Since it was isolated from the mainland it was a perfect spot to keep any horrible virus from escaping and reaching our unprotected shores. \n\nBut soon other things were studied and created, some by design and sometimes by accident.\n\nThe accidents, those were the things that made you realize why they wanted you to sign an NDA, because if you already knew what I’m telling you now, you’d be terrified.\n\nSo, why am I ready to break my vow, opening myself up to jail and fines and the government bringing down the full force of their ability to obfuscate my story.  \n\nI have cancer. \n\nI’m actually in the hospital right now, typing this from my bed with an intravenous in my arm and about two-weeks to live. I’ve entered the who gives a shit moment of my life.\n\nI wanted to let the world know what I saw at Plum Island long before this moment, but I was afraid of what they might do to my son, the only real family I have left. Make no mistake, they’d be able to do whatever they wanted to him if  I didn’t keep my mouth shut.  \n\nThey could get him hooked on drugs, frame him for any crime you could imagine, or have him slip in the shower and snap his neck without the cops suspecting a thing. \n\nThat’s what they could do and did to others.\n\nSo why now? Why so chatty today?\n\nMy son Ned, died yesterday morning in a car crash.\n\nYou might ask, Then why didn’t they just kill you?  \n\nThere were 40 of us who worked there,and there are only 3 of us now. I checked with an actuary friend of mine, who told me that statistically that was off the charts. There was no reason that over three-quarters of us should be dead. \n\nIf you’re counting at home, that’s 37 men and women who worked with me at Plum Island between the ages of twenty-six and fifty-eight who’ve died in the last fifteen-years. That’s either some monumentally bad luck or a really strange coincidence.\n\nSo, the truth is, they are killing us. Slowly, but surely, they’re wiping away any eyewitnesses to the horrors we created on Plum Island. \n\nI told my son before he died that I wanted to let the world know what I saw, but I was afraid for him, and he understood. My son, a code engineer, said they could put a virus on my computer that could relay every website I visited, read every email I sent and every document I created without even being connected to any Wi-Fi, and I believed him. \n\nJust before his crash he set me up with a new laptop he’d said was “clean” and a special VPN that I could connect to the internet through a burner phone to a burner account. There’d be no way anyone could hack into my computer and see what I am typing right now. \nBecause if they could see it, you wouldn’t be reading this. \n\nI’m posting on this forum because there are 17 million readers here and you’re the ones with open minds to believe what I’m about to tell you.\n\nI’m a contractor for the US Army, or was a contractor. I retired two years ago. My work was in mines, not gold mines or copper mines, but the kind that go boom. We were all part of a team that was working on mine detection. \n\nThe upper management folk had run some war game scenarios and the strategists who are paid the big bucks came to a sobering conclusion: the United States’ future “aggressive engagements” would be with countries that loved deploying mines over long stretches of battle fields.\n\nAnd mines meant two things, troops get bogged down and can’t fight and troops lose limbs from encountering the nasty explosives. The truth is the powers-that-be didn’t care about the actual pain and suffering to the soldiers, but they did worry about the bad publicity from parents back home seeing their sons and daughters in wheelchairs and walking around with prosthetic limbs. \n\nThe American people lose their taste for war when Jane and Johnny come home maimed. \n\nSo, me and my group were tasked to find more effective ways to uncover mines. We first looked at all the technical methods, using ground lidar, low-flying magnetic detecting drones, sonic resonance, etc. But they all were too expensive. Remember the big Defense Contracting Machine wants money in their pocket and not invested in our actual defense or battles.\n\nThat’s when we looked into animal detection. It really was pretty goddam cool. Bees were researched first. Yep, bees. They can detect the scent of explosives with their antennas. I’m not making this shit up, Google it. The scientists in Croatia were on the cutting edge with their bee experimentation to find mines.\n\nWe did our own work with the insects but determined they were too fragile a species. They didn’t travel well and since some of the simulated battle plans had America fighting in cold weather areas, the bees wouldn’t work, as they’d go into torpor, a kind of hibernation.\n\nNope, we decided on the rats.\n\nGiant rats from Africa.\n\nSpecifically Gambian Pouched Rats.\n\nThey were about the size of a small Beagle dog,  good old Snoopy, but make no mistake they were rats. Chiseled tooth, disease carrying rodents that squealed and scurried and freaked me the fuck out when I first saw them in their electrified-fenced pens. Again, \nI’m not making this up, we and others had trained these rats to detect the scent of the explosives used in mines. It was the same technique used to teach bomb sniffing dogs, it was just with rats. \n\nYou might ask why rats? \n\nRemember when I mentioned the money grabbing Defense Contracting Machine, the fact was Giant African Rats were cheaper to train then dogs. You could have more of them and they didn’t mind the cold or snow or heat and if they made a mistake no one really cared when Bobo the rat went boom as opposed to Fido the pooch, which broke everyone’s heart.\n\nWe had a squad of bomb sniffing rodents, about 30 of them. \n\nThe Army assigned us ten soldiers to work with the rat squad. They’d learn how to care for them and work them out in the field. We set up a cordoned off area on the island, with an electrical fence surrounding the perimeter. It was about two acres, the size of a couple of football fields. Mines were buried and the Army folks worked the rats to find the mines.\n\nIt all seemed pretty normal aside from the fact were we working with rats.\n\nBut this is when things went sideways.\n\nThe folks who wear the black sunglasses and use a lot of acronyms when they speak told us to genetically modify the rodents. They wanted them bigger, because biologists had determined the bigger the rat the longer they’d live. You see, rats were cheaper than dogs but their life expectancy was half that of canines. If we could make them bigger and live longer that meant even a greater return on the investment. \n\nMoney, money, money.\n\nWe were able to use the Infectious Disease Labs on the island to mutate the genes, but we’d eventually learn something went wrong. Some sort of cross-contamination with the viruses they were studying and the DNA work we were doing, no one was sure how it happened, but it did. \n\nAn accident.\n\nAt first, we were patting ourselves on the backs, a new generation of mine detecting rats were born. They were mega-rodents. Before they were the size of Beagles, but now they were as big as a German Shepherd and bulky like a Pit Bull. \n\nAt first, they seemed to exhibit the same behavior as their predecessors, they found the mines, worked well with their handlers and looked to be the answer to a cheap effective way in eliminating a scourge of modern warfare. \n\nThere were some rules we had to adhere to with the rats. We had to pay strict attention to their mating habits and sterilize them when they were born, because if we didn’t we’d have an army of rats in just a matter of months. The math was actually frightening, a pregnant rat could produce a litter of 10 and give birth to another litter in only 4 weeks. \n\nWhich meant that one female rat could produce 1200 rats in a year! Since we had 16 females, the number would actually increase exponentially, with the maturing rats having their own litters. You could have over 100,000 rats in no time.\n\nBut not just rats, giant dog-sized rodents.\n\nThe first sign something was wrong was on the third day of working with the new rats. We went to their pen to release them to the handlers and saw that five of the thirty rats were dead. They were torn apart and eaten by their pen mates. All the surviving rats had taken part in the feeding frenzy. Every rat in the enclosure that was still alive sported a blood-soaked jaw and face. \n\nIt wasn’t a squabble, the surviving rats had some sort of group think and decided to eat all the smaller rats. \n\nWe should have euthanized them all right then. Looking back it seems so obvious now, but you know, the Fog of War, even though it was peacetime. \n\nThat day in the practice minefield was when I understood why we signed the NDAs.\n\nThe ten soldiers from the Army took the rats out for their normal drills.\n\nWe were in our high tower outside the electrical fence observing and filming the training session. Everything seemed normal, until the biggest rat, the one we called Atlas, got up on his haunches and sniffed the air and shrieked. In an instant the pack of rats attacked the soldiers. \n\nIt was coordinated and swift and the most horrible thing you could ever imagine. They worked as pairs, two rats to every human. The soldiers were unarmed. We were on an island off New York doing animal research, no one thought you needed a gun. \n\nThe soldiers had no way to fight back, and we had no weapons either, so all we could do was watch as the beasts showed why the Bible is a pack of lies, because from what I saw the meek would not inherit the earth, it would be these rats if they ever left the island.\n\nThey’re huge spatula sized front incisors tore at the legs of the soldiers, slicing open their femoral arteries and creating human blood-sprinklers all across the training field. Not one person got more than twenty feet before they were shredded alive, crimson spurts shooting out every which way as the rats chewed and gnawed at their victim’s limbs and faces.\n\nThe sight was beyond horrific, but it was the screams, the howls of pain and terror that have kept me up at night for the last decade. The utter futility of their wailing.\n\nWe radioed for help and were told an Action Containment Team was dispatched from the north end of the island. I had never even heard of an Action Containment Team, or ACT, before, but it seemed as if shit going sideways was something they were familiar with on Plum Island. \n\nThe rats had killed every last soldier in less than five minutes. \n\nThen they charged the fence, even though they knew it was electrified. Working as one ravening swarm they pushed against the chain links and sent sparks shooting into the air, the smell of charred fur and animal flesh rose just below us where the rats were making their push. The front line of rats, about 8 of them were dead, smashed up against the fence.\n\nThe horde regrouped and charged again. More sparks and the putrid smell intensified. The new front line of rats used the dead ones as stepping stones and leaped up the thirty-foot high fence, shoving their legs into the links so they would hook themselves in as 10,000 volts surged through their bodies and killed them. \n\nThey were dead but their bodies and the ones earlier could be used as a path of safe passage to leap over the fence.\n\nMy co-workers down below, who weren’t on the tower screamed in terror, they raced towards the main research lab building, which from what I’d just witnessed would provide no protection at all. Others who were on the far side of the enclosure ran north, towards the infectious disease side of the island. \n\nI was trapped up on the tower with four other technicians as I watched the first rat leap over the fence. It was Atlas, the seeming leader of the murderous pack. I watched as he sniffed and then looked up at us, at me, and then it raced to the inner stairs of the tower. \n\nAs I type this, I can feel my heart quicken, my palms sweating, leaving wet prints on the lower part of my laptop’s keyboard. Fifteen years hasn’t dulled my panic. It’s almost impossible for me to relay how utterly terrified we all were. \n\nI had just watched these evil man-made mutants kill a platoon of soldiers in the most gruesome way imaginable and now the biggest rat of them all was racing towards us, and we had no means of escaping what was coming.\n\nMy dreadful choices raced through my mind.\n\nShould I jump or face the inevitable horror?\n\nIf I jumped and even survived, I’d probably have a broken leg, which meant I couldn’t outrun the pack of rats streaming over the fence. But if I stayed, there was no way I could fight back and I’d end up dead with my face chewed off.\n\nThere was a gun shot.\n\nA group of men? Or women? It was hard to tell as they were covered, head to toe, in yellow hazmat suits and their faces covered in hoods with face shields. They charged along the outer enclosure’s fence line. \n\nI assumed they were the Action Containment Team,  as each wore Kevlar vests and were draped in ammunition belts while carrying M-16 rifles. \n\nThey were expert shots, Navy Seal type snipers, each bullet hit its mark. They were able to drop most of the rats that were bounding over the fence. But Atlas was still climbing towards us. \n\nI heard the pinging ricochets of bullets as the ACT snipers set their sights on Atlas, but he was protected by the spiderweb of metal beams that encased the stairway leading up to our tower.\n\nWe locked the hatch that led from the stairway into our sentry box, as well as pushed a table over it. The whole tower shook when we felt the force of Atlas’ body smash into the doorway. He slammed into it four times and each time we all screamed. \n\nBullets were still flying. \n\nThe pounding stopped, and we thought that Atlas had been shot, but then we heard a scratching noise and realized the rat was crawling along the outside framework of the tower and was making his way towards our open windows. \n\nWe all scrambled to the hatch and pulled off the table. We had to get out. If we were trapped in the small sentry box with that rat it would be a death no one wanted to imagine. \n\nAtlas screeched when it poked its head into the tower, I looked into its black eyes and saw its whiskers twinge. It made a disgusting noise as its lips fluttered up and down its two blood-covered front buck teeth. \n\nI then heard the most wonderful sound in the world, a bullet ripping through Atlas’ head. By crawling outside the tower he had exposed himself to the ACT squad. He plummeted and hit the ground with a thud. More gunshots rang out as the rats were being cut down left and right.\n\nI glanced outside the tower and looked down and saw the carnage of the dead rats and mutilated soldiers. I hurled a gush of vomit from the open window. My sleeve wiped my mouth clean and then I screamed and pointed. \n\nOne of the rats, its fur half-burned off from the electrified fence and limping was making its way to the island’s shoreline. The ACT squad converged to the spot and let loose a fusillade of bullets at the creature. \n\nMany if not all the sharpshooters hit their mark, but the creature still managed to make it to the water and paddle away. \n\nAn ACT squad in a chopper and boat were dispatched.\n\nAfter everyone was checked out for medical reasons, we were debriefed for sixteen hours. At least six different agencies, including the commander of the ACT squad went over with us what we saw and what we would agree per our NDAs we saw. \n\nEach of the dead soldiers had the orders re-routed to Iraq and would officially be classified as killed in action by either an RPG, helicopter crash or of all the ironies you could imagine, a mine. That would explain the terrible conditions of their bodies.\n\nThe one rat that got away eventually washed ashore on Long Island, you might remember it as the “Montauk Monster”, go ahead Google it, you’ll see images of it all over the internet. \n\nThe government was able to have biologists explain it away as a dead and decaying raccoon, but I know what it really was and now so do you.\n\nI don’t expect this post will stay up long. If you are reading it copy and paste it and re-post it to other sites and Facebook, hell email it to whoever you want. The truth is, as I type the last words of this – what should I call it? A recollection? Confession? \n\nI can honestly say I’m at peace for the first time in 15 years. And although this unburdening has given me some comfort, it doesn't change what happened. I know what I created on Plum Island led to the death of ten US Army soldiers, who died in the most horrible way and no amount of words will ever bring them back.\n\nThere were more things I saw at Plum Island that haunt me, I only hope I have time to relay all of them to you.",

        "text": "I’m an archaeologist. Or rather, I’m an archaeology graduate; I completed my degree last year, and I’ve been trying to get onto a postgraduate course since then. It’s a competitive field, with few positions open; I narrowly missed my chance last summer, and I’ve been working in a bank while I apply for more positions.\n\nI studied at an English university, specialising in the Saxon settlement of Britain in the 6th century. Last month one of my professors, who I’ll call Sharon, emailed me; somebody had found a possible new settlement. I won’t say exactly where, but it’s further west than any previously known Saxon village. She had been excavating for some time, and needed help with the work. I was wary of leaving the bank at such short notice, but when she hinted that additional funding for the dig might lead to a postgrad position opening up, I stopped caring about my reference from the bank.\n\nSo the next morning I was on a train with little more than warm clothes, a sleeping bag and a laptop. By lunchtime I arrived at the station, and Sharon picked me up and we headed out to the site.\n\nEngland is very heavily developed, and you’re never more than a few kilometres from at least a small village. So the fact that we drove offroad in the Jeep for nearly half an hour was quite remarkable. Apparently some Scouts had been on a hiking trip and found a mostly buried wall. This sort of thing must happen all the time, but this time they had mentioned it to their scoutmaster, who was a historian and took an interest, eventually leading to the university getting involved. By the time I got there the excavation had been going for a while; the outlines of several buildings were visible, and I estimated the settlement would have housed around 30 people. Sharon helped me set up my tent, and then gave me a tour of the site.\n\nThere were five of us at the site in total. I had no specific job, but suspected I was mainly going to be doing the physical work. Sharon had twenty years’ experience on me, and as the site lead would be responsible for writing reports; the university was going through an efficiency drive and she had to submit daily reports to justify the expense of the dig. “Mark” and “Penny” were undergrads, and “Justin” was an 18-year-old taking a gap year, so as the second most senior person there, I was also in charge of documentation. We were a very young group, and only I and Sharon were taking any remuneration for the work. If we proved the site worthy of additional funding before Justin, Penny and Mark had to go home, no doubt more experienced archaeologists would take their place, so I was very conscious that I had a limited time to prove myself.\n\nThis was October, and by the time I had set myself up the light was fading fast. But keen to get to grips with the site, I spent the last hour of daylight studying the layout, sketching and making measurements. Given my knowledge of similar settlements I made some predictions regarding the extent of the site, and where we might find further buildings. Judging from the rest of the architecture, I figured the settlement might be post-Christian, and estimated possible locations for a church.\n\nI spent the next two days looking for the church. Given the lack of funding we had very limited equipment, but I’d been right about the location. On the third day I uncovered part of a stone wall, a strong indicator of a church, and got Justin and Penny to help me uncover the shape.\n\nIt was two days later that I found it. Justin was off helping Sharon, and Mark was taking lunch, so I was working on my own, uncovering the floor of the church. As I slowly scraped the soil with my trowel, I saw a hint of orange. I pulled out my brush and carefully cleaned the area, to find what looked like an orange thread, buried in the ground at both ends.\n\nThis concerned me, although at the time, not for the right reasons. Orange thread was far from anything I associated with the Saxons. I called Penny over, as I knew she had an interest in Saxon textiles. She agreed that this was unlike anything she’d seen before; most likely, the site had been contaminated recently. But we couldn’t be sure, so Penny and I brushed the area to reveal more.\n\nAfter an hour we had uncovered a network of threads about half a metre across. They ran through the ground in an organic pattern, like fungal mycelia. One thread had been uncovered sufficiently for Penny to put her finger underneath and lift it up; before I could stop her, the thread snapped. It quickly turned to dust, causing my nose to itch and Penny to sneeze. I reprimanded her for her carelessness, and we then agreed to cover it up. It was early evening, and we didn’t want moisture to affect the area. Our limited budget hadn’t even given us an excavation shelter, so we just put a sheet of polythene over the area and weighed it down with stones.\n\nSharon knew no more than we did about the likely provenance of the orange threads. She took some photos and told us to leave it undisturbed until some of her colleagues had a chance to review it. And with the sun setting and Sharon typing up her daily report, the rest of us had a couple of beers and settled in to sleep.\n\nI awoke around 6 the next morning to the sound of car engines. Pulling on my shoes and coat, I crawled out of the tent. Sharon and Mark were already up, watching four black SUVs pull up and park next to the camp. A man in a crisp black suit stepped out of the lead car, and demanded curtly to speak to the project lead. He and Sharon walked off and began talking. I couldn’t make out much, but I did hear Sharon raise her voice in argument a few times. The others were out of their tents now, and we spent about fifteen minutes in wild conjecture until Sharon and the suit walked back. Sharon told us that the project was over, and we needed to pack our tents and leave immediately.\n\nOf course we argued. This dig could make my career, and besides, Penny and I were very keen to learn more about the orange threads. There was no way these interlopers had the slightest clue about archaeology, and would no doubt ruin the site if left alone with it. But in half an hour we’d packed our things and were in our cars. During the whole time nobody else stepped foot out of the black SUVs. We left, and Sharon gave me a lift back home.\n\nI was in a dark mood that evening. I hadn’t pleased my line manager at the bank when I’d quit without notice, so doubted they’d take me back; and it looked like my chance for a PhD was gone. But in the morning as I settled down to search for jobs, I got a phone call. Sharon wanted the five of us to continue working. We may have been kicked off the dig site, but they couldn’t stop us reviewing what we’d found so far. So on Monday I met Sharon, Mark and Penny in a cafeteria at the university. Justin had apparently made other plans.\n\nBetween sketches, measurements, notes and photographs, we had actually gathered quite a lot of data, and it would likely take a couple of weeks to review it all. Sharon worked with Penny on mapping out the site in detail, and I worked with Mark on a literature review of comparable sites. But as the day wore on I started to feel unaccountably wary of Mark. I’d got on with him very well at the site, but now he felt … off, somehow. The more I looked at him, the more I felt uncomfortable, as though being in the same room was dangerous, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.\n\nThe next day didn’t ease my feelings. Something just seemed wrong; not the “creepy guy” vibe I’ve got off some men, but more a sense that he was planning something nefarious. I confided in Penny over a coffee at lunch, and she confessed that she had got a similar feeling from Sharon.\n\nBy Wednesday I was feeling a little under the weather, but able to go in. When the four of us met, Mark asked if I was okay. I wouldn’t normally remark on this, but the way Mark said it … it felt very accusatory. Sharon said I should work from home. I glanced at Penny, who just shrugged. Were Mark and Sharon planning something? To be honest, Mark and Sharon looked worse than I felt; pale, perhaps, and their posture seemed vaguely threatening. I didn’t want to leave them unsupervised, and insisted that I was fine to continue. Before settling down to work I managed to catch Penny alone at the coffee machine.\n\n“Do I look okay to you?” I opened.\n\n“Yeah, a bit tired maybe. I don’t … I thought they were out of order back there.”\n\n“I don’t trust them. Can you keep an eye on Sharon?”\n\n“Sure, actually I was going to say the same to you. See if Mark’s acting weird, we can catch up at lunch.”\n\nI found Mark in the spare office we were using, with the papers already out. As we got to work I studied Mark, noting his expression and posture. Again it was subtle, but there was definitely something not right. I caught his dark brown eyes, and for an instant they seemed to flash orange. Then suddenly he exploded.\n\n“WHAT?!”\n\n“What do you mean?” I replied calmly.\n\n“You’ve been staring at me all morning. Have you got something to say?”\n\n“No, I …” What could I say? “I just …”\n\n“Look, if you want to ask me out, just come out and say it.”\n\nI was astonished. What did he think was going on?\n\n“I uh …” I had no idea what to do. “Umm, we should just …”\n\nI looked down at my papers. I started to collate the citations, but had barely listed them all when Mark said he was going to lunch. It couldn’t have been ten o’clock yet, but when I looked at my phone, it was half past twelve. I glanced at Mark’s work, and he’d done at least three hours worth of work. I’d felt a bit unwell, sure, but how had I lost two hours?\n\nMark got up and left. I could have carried on, but Penny had agreed to meet for lunch, so I headed down to the cafeteria, to find her sat down by herself. I grabbed a sandwich and water, and joined her.\n\n“So,” Penny started in a low conspiratorial voice, “anything to report?”\n\nI recounted the outburst, the strange conversation, the odd body language. I almost didn’t mention the flash of orange I’d seen, or thought I’d seen, in Mark’s eyes; but when I did, Penny gasped.\n\n“I saw that too!”\n\n“In Mark?”\n\n“No, in Sharon.”\n\n“Wow, okay. That’s weird. Any ideas?”\n\n“Well I wasn’t going to say it. I thought it was my imagination, but –” Penny leaned in closely and lowered her voice even more. “You remember the threads we found at the dig?”\n\n“Of course, they …” Suddenly I realised what she meant. “They were the same orange, weren’t they?”\n\n“What does it mean?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I replied, “but I’ve got an idea. Let’s meet at five.”\n\n“No, I don’t feel good staying here with Sharon. Tell her you’ve decided to go home after all, and I’ll make up some excuse. Why don’t we meet in my halls of residence? It’s only ten minutes from here.”\n\nSo Penny and I left the department early. Penny had a single room in her halls of residence, even smaller than my old one, and we cleared as much space as we could on her tiny desk. She offered me a coffee, but I didn’t feel like one, and neither did she. The coffee that morning had tasted very bitter, so with a glass of water each and some notebooks, we started writing everything we knew.\n\n“What’s *cordyceps*?”\n\nPenny had glanced over at my notes before I was ready to compare.\n\nI explained what I knew. “It’s a fungus. It infects ants, and controls their brain. It takes them somewhere more suitable for the fungus to grow, and slowly eats them, converting their body into more of itself.”\n\nPenny looked disgusted for a moment, and then realised what I was getting at. The orange threads from the dig site, that were most likely mycelia – had they infected Sharon and Mark?\n\nPenny opened her laptop and Googled *cordyceps*. I’d got a few things wrong, but the basic principle was correct. “Do you think that’s what it was?”\n\n“Well no, not *cordyceps*, that only infects ants. But something like it. Something that can control humans would have to be more complex, I suppose.”\n\n“Well, we both saw the orange in their eyes. The eyes are part of your brain, sort of. I guess it would explain their weird behaviour, right?”\n\nWe talked about this for a long time, bouncing theories off each other. Something that could infect the complex brain of a human – well, it would have to be more sophisticated. The government agents that had closed down our dig site had arrived so quickly. They must have already known about the fungus, but not about that site. So there must be other sites. Could they be linked together, operating as a neural network across the country – even across the planet – an intelligent fungus, infecting hosts to achieve … whatever their aims might be?\n\nWe realised that the agents had arrived too late. I don’t know why they didn’t quarantine us, but we had no way of contacting them. We could have asked Sharon, but if she was far enough gone, she wouldn’t help us. We had to do something ourselves.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was myself or Penny who first said it, but we reluctantly agreed that it was the only option. We had to stop the infection from spreading. We sat up late into the night, planning our next steps, and I slept on Penny’s floor. I’d gone home sick that day, so I would pretend to be ill and collect the equipment we needed, except for the car – Penny texted her brother asking to borrow his, saying she needed it for a university project.\n\nThe next morning, Penny went in to the department. I tried to persuade her not to, but she insisted that somebody needed to keep an eye on the disease’s progression. She was right, of course. I spent the day gathering supplies. It would have been easier to wait for the car, but we had to move fast. I met Penny that afternoon, somewhat relieved that she was okay, and her brother dropped the car off. He wanted to stay and enjoy the university life for a night, but we had work to do, so Penny made some half-hearted excuse and he took the last train home.\n\nWe checked our equipment, went over the plan again, and for a second night I slept on Penny’s floor.\n\nThe next day we went to the university. I walked while Penny drove, so that we didn’t arrive together and arouse suspicion. That morning was one of the most difficult few hours of my life, pretending to Mark that everything was normal. He looked different, twisted somehow, though nobody but Penny and I seemed to notice. Sharon was the same.\n\nWe took Sharon and Mark out for lunch. We told them that we were so happy to be part of this project that we wanted to repay them. Our treat, we said. Sharon protested, saying that it should be her to pay for all of us, but eventually they agreed. I normally like Mexican food, but it tasted strangely sour, as though the ingredients had gone off somehow. But we weren’t there for pleasure. Our plan was risky, but it worked; I won’t explain what the drug was, or how I obtained it, but I managed to slip it into Sharon’s and Mark’s food without them noticing.\n\nWe kept them there “celebrating” for an hour or so, long enough for the drug to take effect. By this time, Sharon and Mark were feeling ill, and Penny offered to drive them back to the department. She had left her car in the restaurant’s car park, and we helped them into the back seat; I got into the passenger seat, and Penny started to drive.\n\nOf course we weren’t going back to the university. We drove about half an hour out of town, to an area of scrubland, far from any houses, and drove out of sight of the main road. Penny feigned concern, and suggested to Sharon and Mark that they might want to get some fresh air. Eventually they agreed, and we helped them out of the car. We then went back to the car, collecting the two hammers I’d bought the previous day. Drugged as they were, we still needed to take them by surprise. I struck Mark three times in the head, and Penny hit Sharon twice. That was enough to stop them moving. I don’t know for sure if they were dead at this point, but we were sure there was no coming back from that.\n\nPenny covered the back seats with plastic sheeting while I did my best to make sure their injuries weren’t obvious; then we put them back in the car. Penny drove for four hours while I navigated, and as night started to fall, we arrived back at that cursed dig site.\n\nWe had expected this to be the most difficult part of our plan, but the agents were nowhere to be seen. I have no idea why not – for all their apparent aggressiveness, did they not realise precisely what they were dealing with? The alternative – that they had themselves become infected – was too terrible to contemplate. Still, it made our task far easier. We parked as close as we could, and dragged the bodies the remaining fifty metres to lay them in the ruined church. If they were infected, then so was the ground, and we could at least contain the infection. Also, it was likely that nobody would encounter the bodies for months or perhaps years to come. And so we left Sharon and Mark to rot in the infected soil, and drove back. It was four in the morning when we arrived, and we went back to Penny’s room.\n\nOur task was done. (Or so we thought.) We celebrated with a bottle of wine, but the wine had gone sour, so we abandoned it and went with water instead.\n\nAt that point it was Saturday morning. Neither of us were feeling great, and we spent most of the weekend in Penny’s small bed watching Netflix. We decided to go in on Monday morning, so as not to arouse suspicion, and continue working on the archaeological write-up.\n\nOver the course of that day, we realised that we’d acted too late. Other people in the department had strange expressions, or orange-tinted veins in their eyes. We went out for lunch, each having a salad and water, and our server looked infected as well. I don’t understand why Penny and I are the only ones who can see it.\n\nOur task is clear now, though. We’ve done it before, and we can do it again. We must do it again. We must cleanse the world of this fungus, killing the infected and taking their bodies to that ancient Saxon church, before it spreads beyond our control. If it hasn’t already.",

I remember closing my eyes quite forcefully, feeling pain from how bright the lights were. Once I was able to keep them open, I noticed how the entire room was white. It was empty except for the lamp that shone on my face and the recliner I was laying on. I remember how my muscles ached with each movement. It was as painful as my headache though. I tried to think of where the place was or who I was but only a blank came up.\n\nI’m called ████\n\nMy body is 23 years old. It was the same age as when I woke up. Maintaining your body’s age is important for players like me. Each week, we have to be tranquilised and transported to the facility in which, once again, we wake up in a white room with a spotlight beaming at our faces. Same room, same recliner, same muscle pain and headache. The first time I woke up was quite memorable, we were ushered by the existing players into a large hall where the operator gave us instructions and information. I’m quite curious, that’s how I was ... .....  .... ..  ... ....  .. ..  .... ..  . .  ... ..  ... ..  . .....  . ...., so being inputted that much information when I was starting from a blank slate was very interesting for me.\n\nLife is a game and there are no rules, that is, if you are a player like me.\n\nEach player has different gameplay. Some like changing the world, gaining knowledge and making characters that are wise and make differences. These players are usually given top pick in the characters they play, most go for good starting stats like being born into a wealthy family, or having good genes. There are a select few who like adversity, zero to hero gameplay. Entertaining, I’ll give them that. Most players choose from characters that are drawn randomly. The number of characters you can play depends on many things, the main one being existence. When I first woke up, I got to play 7 characters for my first run. Some don’t even get to play a character on their first few years of existence, so I am guessing I had pre-keyed existence points.\n\nAlthough you are but a game character to players like me, it doesn’t mean you aren’t sentient. In fact, giving characters free reign to their own lives is one of the most famous gameplay styles within the association. Unpredictable, interesting, fun. Some players like to bet on things like whether a character will choose this or that. I personally don’t find the fun in it but to each their own.\n\nLike characters, players used to have a lifespan. Rejuvenating the body and reversing ageing was one of the milestones that led to the establishment of the association. Nowadays, we’ve even found ways to extend the brain’s life. We are expecting to achieve deathlessness by 2178. That’s around 3 or 4 more runs from now. It excites me.\n\nLike game characters, we can also form partnerships with other players. Since our bodies are human, many choose to coexist in your societies. It’s been a thing since hundreds of thousands of years ago but around a thousand years prior to now, something caused players to recluse, I haven’t been briefed on it and my existence does not trace that far back. Since a couple hundred years ago, there’s been a reemergence of players looking to assimilate into player’s societies. There’s a funny irony with living side by side with the characters you play while knowing you have control over their lives. We are advised not to meddle too much and be observers but players have no rules so some do tend to do actions that are risky.\n\nI personally like interacting like a real character. I find reading your content particularly interesting, books, articles, news, even conspiracy theories. Having observed for the last hundred years, I find it quite funny how you bend and change your stories so often. Comparing history with your history is particularly funny for me. Sometimes I find myself giggling while I look at the material we’ve acquired from the Seat of the Muses. Players who make remarkable contributions to the association are rewarded handsomely by being given the honour of inputting their consciousness into our system so their existence lives on until this day. I’ve always wanted to meet them but unfortunately, the technology to communicate with them is still lacking.\n\nIgnorant characters are easier to play. Once you are put in charge of a hundred and more characters, you start preferring idle gameplay where characters won’t go off course even if you leave them alone for long periods of time. It’s much more entertaining to play with a select few characters. Everyone else is just to fill up the world.\n\nMy type of gameplay is quite different. Playing with characters that are in secret societies, partake in secretive activities and hide information from the majority of the existing characters while not knowing the biggest secret of all. It’s funny in an entertaining way.\n\nThe existence of players might be a scary thing for most characters to hear, however, the existences you should be most wary of are characters just like you. Next time you go out, keep an eye out for me. I might just give you that stroke of luck you need, or better yet, I might help you find what you’ve been looking for.\n\nLife’s a game. You’re a character I play.",

        "text": "\n\nI first heard about “The Man in the T.V.” from my Great Uncle Bernard.  He had been a film editor in the fifties and early sixties, and while he hadn’t worked in Hollywood in decades, he never lost his love of movies and T.V. shows.  Over the years, he’d collected a massive wealth of both—everything from antique original film prints from the early days of cinema to laserdiscs, DVDs, and even a few Blu-Rays before he died.\n\nThat’s why, when I was deciding on the theme of my final project for my capstone film class, I went straight to him despite being a bit nervous about visiting after such a long time.  It was strange.  I had vivid memories of my great uncle when I was very young.  He had been fun and funny and energetic, and even though he lived a couple of states over, there were never more than a few months that went by before he stopped in to visit for a day or two, full of stories and jokes and excitement.  \n\nBut then it just…stopped.  I didn’t see him again until my high school graduation, and he seemed much older and stranger than I’d remembered him.  He was nice enough as he patted me on the back and gave me an envelope with a large check in it for a graduation gift, but soon after he was gone.  When I asked my mother where he’d went and what was wrong with him, she hesitated to answer, and when she did, I could tell she wasn’t telling me the whole truth.\n\n“He’s just been through a lot.  He lost his wife a couple of years back and he’s getting older, and sometimes that makes people strange.  But it was nice that he came, wasn’t it?”\n\nIt was, but more than his visit what stood out to me the most about that night was how Mom had responded.  It was the first time I’d ever known her to lie to me, and at the time I didn’t understand why.  Still, when years later I was in graduate school and decided to go visit him, I didn’t mention it to her.  Instead I tracked down his number and called him myself. \n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Uncle Bernard?  This is Toby.  Your great nephew Toby, I mean.”\n\n“Oh?  Hey there, Toby.  Good to hear from you.  Everything all right?”\n\n“Yeah, yeah.  I’m actually finishing up grad school this year.  Film, if you can believe it.”\n\n“Oh?  Well isn’t that wonderful?  It’s a great profession, I’m here to tell you.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m excited for it.  Which…well, the reason I’m calling is I want to do great on my final project for one of my classes.  And I was thinking about finding some really obscure movie or t.v. show and doing a paper based on that.  I’ve tried searching on the internet, but that’s just the same shi…same stuff over and over again, you know?  So I was wondering if you still have your collection.”\n\n“Hmm?  Oh yes.  It’s quite a preoccupation of mine.”  He paused, and when he spoke again, there was a new tension in his voice.  “But I don’t know if its anything you’d be interested in.”\n\n“Oh, I doubt that.  I remember Mom always talking about how you had more movies than anybody on the East Coast.”\n\nHe gave a brittle laugh.  “Well, that’s an exaggeration, but I do have quite a lot.”  Another lengthy silence and then, “Very well.  You are welcome to come and visit.  I can give you access to quite a selection for you to pick from.  If you’re sure you’re interested in coming all this way.”\n\nI told him I was, and the next weekend, I headed there to see what I could find.\n\n**** \n\nAt one time, Bernard’s house had likely been beautiful.  A sprawling 5,000 square feet, it sat on the middle of ten acres of lawn that was still well-manicured and maintained, even as the house squatted in the middle, slowly rotting.\n\nOr maybe rotting was too harsh of a term.  Disrepair and decline?  Definitely.  But nothing that cleaning and painting couldn’t largely fix.   Still, seeing the state of things made my stomach clench a little.  Was this just a preview of how Bernard himself was going to be?  \n\nBut the man that opened the door was much like he’d been before.  If anything, he was a bit closer to the old Bernard I remembered from my youth than the pale, worn-thin man that had come to my graduation a few years before.  This version of him was energetic if a bit jittery, and he seemed genuinely excited to have me there.\n\nGiving me a quick hugging handshake, he ushered me inside, and for a moment I felt relief that this was just a nice, normal house.  No trash on the floor or mazes made out of old newspapers.  Just a weird but tidy old man that needed someone to paint his house.\n\nBut as we stepped further in to where the first doorways opened up, my heart began to sink.  There was very little furniture in the rooms, and what was there was pushed haphazardly against the walls.  That was understandable, however, as there was no room for that stuff anywhere else.\n\nThe rest of the rooms were devoted to his collection.\n\nRack after rack filled with banker boxes, film canisters, binders and various other containers—all neatly stacked, labeled and organized.  On the one hand, it was incredibly impressive.  On the other…I’d half expected a rat’s nest of old junk I’d have to go through.  The symptoms of hoarding or some other compulsion that had spiraled into chaos.\n\nBut this was the opposite of that.  There were catalogues for each rack at the ends of the row, and while I didn’t understand the system of order and organization he was using at a glance, there was no question there was such a system in place.  A degree of volume and precision that, even just walking through the front rooms, seemed to border on insane.  Particularly when I felt I already knew the answer to my next question.\n\n“There’s more of this than just these two rooms, aren’t there?”\n\nHis face split into a grin.  “Oh yes.  Much, much more.”\n\n****\n\nThere were nineteen rooms in my great-uncle’s house, and at least fifteen of them were filled with more of the same well-organized racks of movies and shows, all labeled and categorized as meticulously as the first rooms I’d seen.  The kitchen, the bathroom, and one bedroom were the only areas free from the collection, and despite my protests Bernard insisted I take that bedroom, as he had a fold-out couch in his office.  I’d seen his office and wondered how he’d actually pull out a bed in there with the rows upon rows of 1970s sitcoms and westerns occupying the space, but he was adamant he’d be fine and slept in there much of the time anyway.  \n\nAnd I say “at least” fifteen rooms because there was a final room at the back of the house that he told me was off-limits.  He gave the impression there were more films or something similar in there, but he wouldn’t give any details and I thought it was rude to press the issue, so I just agreed to stay out and we moved on.\n\nWe had lunch and I got my stuff unpacked, and by late that afternoon I was starting my dive into his treasure trove.  His house was actually ideal for what I was doing—he had high-quality equipment for viewing both modern and older formats, and despite the constant crowding from the collection itself, he had allowed sufficient workspaces throughout to easily view things in different rooms depending on what kind of media you were looking at.  As for Bernard himself, he would occasionally come by and check in on me, telling me a story about something I was looking at or where he discovered it and rescued it from obscurity, but to a large extent he left me alone to explore the collection as I wanted.\n\nThe deeper I got into looking at everything, the more I realized how much I’d underestimated how long this might take.  While everything was very well organized, the content of the collection itself was dizzyingly eclectic.  This wasn’t a man who had just salvaged hidden gems or rare prints of acclaimed films and shows.  He had some of that, sure, but most of his collection was strange stuff I’d never heard of and that I doubted many people had.\n\nA Canadian film about vampire bikers made in the 1940s and set in a “futuristic” 1960s America.  I just scrubbed through it quickly, but there was some kind of subplot about bears developing telekinesis.\n\nA pilot episode for a T.V. show about a family with a robot butler.  It was generally played for laughs, but twice during the episode it became clear that the robot was secretly trying to murder his family and kept being stopped by bad luck and circumstance.  The episode ended with the youngest son, Johnny, walking in on the robot mixing rat poison in with the family’s evening meal.  This moment of terror was punctuated by a canned “oooooh” from the “audience” followed by raucous laughter as the credits began to roll.\n\nA documentary about teaching parrots to quote poetry.\n\nAnd on and on it went.  A lot of the things I looked at in the first couple of days were boring and pedestrian, bizarre only in the fact that anyone bothered to collect them.  But scattered among them were enough gems that were either quirky or interesting enough to warrant a project all on their own.  The longer I looked, the more I found, and while it was exciting, it was also overwhelming.  I didn’t know what to pick, and I wasn’t sure if I could find out a lot about these more obscure productions unless I learned it from my uncle.\n\nI brought up doing an extensive interview with him about his film collection, and initially he was resistant to the idea.  But I think he could tell by the third day that I wasn’t making as much progress as I’d hoped and so he agreed to answer any questions I had that night after dinner.\n\n**** \n\nI started the interview off more formally.  I told him I was going to record him, and I had a few pages of questions I’d scribbled down to give some structure to what I was asking.  I didn’t mention it to him, but as I’d worked on those questions, I’d come around more and more to the idea that my project should be about Bernard as much or more than any individual film.  His love of stories and films, his meticulous and odd collection of so many obscure things that most hobbyists would pass over or ignore.  So I started with questions about him and his life, how he got into making movies, what made him stop, and what led him to start collecting.\n\nHis answers were somewhat interesting, and Bernard was always an engaging conversationalist, but it wasn’t until I got past those initial questions and we started just *talking* that I felt like we were getting somewhere.  He told me stories about tracking down a barn full of old silent movies that were somehow actually still largely intact despite their typical fragility.  About bribing a Brazilian custom’s officer who was threatening to seize a duffel bag filled with Betamax tapes of Japanese game shows from the 1980s.  Every story was funnier and wilder than the last, and it was clear that Bernard was enjoying having someone to share the stories with.  When he started getting into finding an impounded car that had a cache of DVDs in Kansas, I laughingly stopped him for a moment.\n\n“How…how are you finding all these things?  I mean is it all through classifieds and stuff, or are you actively hunting things down…or?”\n\nHe grinned and gave a small shrug.  “Lots of ways, really.  When I started out, it was mainly going to rummage sales and occasionally finding a mail-order company that was looking to sell stuff cheap.  A lot of that stuff…well, it’s just the same garbage over and over.”  He chuckled.  “I know you think I have a ton in here, and maybe I do, but over the years I’ve discarded ten or twenty times as much, especially at first.”\n\nReferring back to an earlier note, I interjected.  “Because you want to keep stuff that has merit and other people might have forgotten about.”\n\nHe nodded.  “Yes, that’s a big part of it.  And over time, I’ve developed a lot of ways of finding the kinds of stuff I’m looking for.  It’s just like anything, I guess.  The deeper you go down into a particular hole of interest, the smaller the pool of people becomes.  Where I started with swap meets and widows, I wound up making contacts around the world that specialize in looking for this kind of stuff.  Weird, obscure stuff that still has quality about it.”  His smile faded a little.  “Other stuff too.”\n\nI thought about the room he kept locked.  “Have you ever found any…you know, extreme stuff?  Like, um, snuff films or something?”\n\nHis smile was gone now, but he gave another smaller nod.  “I have.  I don’t keep anything like that, of course.  Filthy stuff.  And most of it is faked.  But yes, you have to be careful swimming in the deeper pools of the film discovery community.  There are some sick people out there.  I’ve had a couple of times where I’ve had to notify the authorities when I get wind of someone potentially hurting others.”\n\n“Yeah, well, I knew you wouldn’t have it.  But, I mean that’s good that you helped them get caught.  Um, like what about some of the really weird stuff?  Like the show about the robot butler that’s trying to kill his family?  How’d that ever get made at all?”\n\nBernard didn’t smile again, but he did give a brief laugh at the robot butler’s mention.  “That was shot in Arizona in 1991.  The supposed pitch was that it was supposed to be a weird and dark sitcom with an edge—bear in mind that Twin Peaks had come out the year before so there was some market for that kind of thing, though most never got past pitching.  But the guy that made this, his father was a decently rich producer.  I think everyone knew it wasn’t going anywhere.  It was way too much for a network to pick up.  But that happens a lot.  People call in favors, make dead-end projects to spread the wealth, that kind of thing.”  He rubbed his lip.  “Still, I think the guy that made it must have been pretty passionate about it.”\n\nI quirked an eyebrow at him.  “What makes you say that?”\n\nHe started to respond and then waved his hand.  “You don’t want to hear all this stuff.”\n\nFrowning, I shook my head vehemently.  “No, I do.  This is cool as shit.”\n\nHe did smile a bit then.  “Fine, fine.  Get me a drink first.  Maybe two.  And then I’ll tell you more about the butler.”\n\nBernard was sipping on his second glass of bourbon when he cleared his throat and started back to telling his tales.\n\n****\n\n“So the guy who made the robot butler pilot, his name was Bertrand Stokely.  Not exactly a glamourous name for the big or small screen, but the Bernards of the world aren’t in any position to judge.  Best as I can tell, he only ever shot three things commercially.  A couple of ads for soap companies in the late eighties and then this robot butler T.V. pilot in 1991.  Naturally it didn’t get picked up, and he never made anything else, so that’s the end of that, right?\n\n“Except it’s not.  Because I’ve got a copy of *another* T.V. show that claims to have been made in 1994 with a robot butler that wants to kills his human family.  Except that one had four episodes and was in the middle of shooting the fifth and sixth when something happened that stopped production for good.”\n\nI stared at him incredulously.  “So what?  Someone else took that weird idea and tried to copy it?  And they actually made it a show?”\n\nHe gave me a strange look.  “That’s what I thought at first, too.  But when I actually got the copies of the second show and watched them, I realized something else was going on.  The father and mother?  They were the same actors.  So was little Jack or John or whatever his name is.”\n\n“Johnny.”\n\nBernard pointed with his nearly empty glass.  “Yeah.  Him.  That kid looked a little older than he had in the original, which would make sense if it was made a couple of years later.”\n\n“So it was the original show being made again?  Same plot and everything?”\n \nHe waggled his hand slightly, the puddle of bourbon sloshing around.  “Kinda sorta, but not exactly.  The first episode is almost shot for shot like the pilot except it’s a few minutes longer.  After…who’d you say?  Johnny?  After Johnny sees what the robot is doing, the robot convinces him its for the best.  That he’s trying to make a better version of the family for them both.  So the boy helps him poison his family, and then they take their bodies down into the basement.  Next episode, new versions of the family are back upstairs like nothing ever happened.  The mother is the same, but the father and older daughter are different this time.  Over the course of the episode, they do things the robot and boy don’t like, and before its done they’re dead and back down in the basement again.  This pattern somewhat repeats in every episode, though the parts I’ve seen of five and six were going in an even stranger direction.”\n\nI wondered if he was drunk or just full of shit, but despite the oddness of what he was telling me, I thought I believed him.  “That’s so fucking weird.  So who made *that* version of the show?  The same guy?”\n\nHe drained his drink and shook it at me.  “Have to pay the toll.”\n\nWhen I was back with another drink, he continued.  “Again, you’re riding the same train of thought I was at the time.  I checked and it wasn’t Bertrand Stokely.  It was Bertrand Stoker.”\n\n“He changed his name?  Like…slightly?  Why?”\n\nBernard shook his head.  “That’s the thing.  He didn’t.  Bertrand Stokely killed himself the week after the original pilot was filmed.”\n\n“Oh.  Damn.  So what, he filmed two versions before he died?”\n\n“No, I don’t think that’s possible either, for several reasons.”  He held up a finger as he ticked off each point.  “First, like I said before, the actors that are the same do seem older than before, especially the boy.  Second, one of those actors had a variation on their name the second time too.  I think the last name was the same but the first name was different.  Third, there are a handful of times in the second batch of episodes that events or pop culture is referenced that wouldn’t have existed in 1991.”\n\n“Like what?”\n\n“The *Jurassic Park* movie for one, which didn’t release until June of 1993.  The Waco thing where all those cult members died for another.  That was in the spring of the same year.”\n\n“Jesus.  On a sitcom?”\n\nHe shrugged.  “Yeah, but remember this is the same show that is murdering and resurrecting the family every week.  Point being, stuff that wouldn’t have been known to reference when Bertrand Stokely was still alive to make it.”  He took a deeper swig as he went on.  “But more than that, there are references to other things that are clearly supposed to be similar type references to other events or movies or other things, but they’re things that, at least as far as I can tell, don’t actually exist in our world.”\n\nI paused at that last, but pushed on with the more obvious question.  “Like what?”\n\nBernard shook his head slightly.  “I don’t remember them all, but the one that stood out the most was *Sonic Man*.  They talk about a *Sonic Man* movie, some superhero movie with Nicholas Cage in it, in the same breath as *Jurassic Park*.  Like it’s a real thing.”\n\nI felt a nervous chill creeping up my spine and pushed it away.  “Well, okay.  I mean, but it’s obviously some weird shit anyway.  Is it that strange that they mixed in some made up movie with real stuff?”\n\nHe finished his drink and stared down at the glass.  “The thing is, that’s not the only time I’ve seen that movie referenced.  At last count, I have approximately 21,345 pieces of media in this house.  And across those I’ve found at least twenty references to the *Sonic Man* movie franchise.    I’ve also found over three hundred repeated references to other events or popular culture that does not exist in our world.  And I’m not talking about things that are obviously made up for the story being told.  I’m talking about matching references to the same thing across different movies and shows made years apart with no apparent connection other than they’re aware of the same things—things that never happened here.”\n\nMy mouth felt dry as I forced myself to ask the harder question.  “You keep saying ‘our world’.  Do you think this stuff is from somewhere else?”\n\nThere was no warmth in his smile this time.  “Well that would be crazy, wouldn’t it?”\n\nI shook my head.  “I don’t know.  It does sound crazy, I guess, but I don’t think we know everything there is to know, either.  Maybe it’s like alternate realities or something.”\n \nMy answer seemed to mollify him a little.  “Maybe.  Yes, maybe.”\n\nI pushed on.  “Where did those things come from?  The ones that seem off from our world?”\n\nBernard shrugged.  “Not one place.  Not even a dozen.  They just come in with other things.  If I didn’t collect so much and pay so much attention, I’d never even know the oddities were there.”\n\n“Have you ever tried asking around about it?  See if anyone else has noticed the same stuff?”\n\nHe pursed his lips.  “At first I did, a little.  But some of these circles are…and I don’t mean this unkindly as I may be counted among them by many…lonely nutjobs looking for a bit of magic in their lives.  You’re a lot more likely to get made up bullshit or conspiracy theories than you are any useful information.  Experience has taught me to only trust what I can see for myself.”\n\nWe sat for a few moments in companionable silence, and when I spoke next, I realized I’d woken Bernard up.  “Would you be okay with me looking at all of this stuff?  Both the things you’ve found and seeing if I can find more?”\n\nBlinking blearily, he stared at me for a moment before nodding.  “I…yes, I think so.  But we need to agree.  Agree before you put things in your paper.”\n\nI nodded.  “Sure.  No, I understand that.”  Bernard was already drifting back off to sleep.  “We can talk more about it tomorrow.”\n\nI let him doze a few minutes more, and would have left him in his chair but I was afraid he’d be stiff if he slept like that all night.  Gently shaking his shoulder, I told him it was time to go to bed.  I was startled when his eyes snapped open, wide and fearful, and he gripped my arm hard enough to hurt.\n\n“Don’t…Don’t let him see you.”\n\nYanking my arm free, I assumed he’d been having a dream, but I couldn’t help but ask anyway.  “Who?  Don’t let who see me?”\n\nTears were forming in the corners of Bernard’s eyes.  [“The man.  The man in the T.V.  He keeps staring at me.”](https://redd.it/11n5jz5)",

        "text": "All my life. There she was. I say she but who knows what it is. A presence that I’ve never been able to prove but am routinely tortured by, costing me any small chance of connection with other people, family or not.\n\nI’m utterly alone.\n\nThis yearly “tradition” has gone on for so long and now I’ve hit the final mark of my sanity, with absolutely no one to confide in anymore. So I’m going to put it out for everyone to see, before I finish things.\n\nI remember being annoyed walking into the sterile, beige doctor’s office at the age of 7. My friend Danny was hosting his weekly freeze tag gathering in his absurdly large yard, and I was being ripped away for some “problem” that I thought was completely normal. A blurry figure, 50 or so meters out, whom I giggled at due to its awkward stature.\n\nMy imagination gave it many identities, from a quirky angel protecting me as I constantly attempted to show off to it, all the way to a neighborhood mime that my friends apparently just refused to tell me about. However, after hearing about all my fellow neighbors’ imaginary friends that they’d tell secrets to and share tea parties with, I thought that this figure was just my own version of that. Imagination is the strongest form of denial.\n\nThe doctor shuffled his way into the room, followed by a not so enthusiastic “Shelly?”, consulting his clipboard. I nodded robotically, uncomfortable by the cold environment along with the tall stranger I was being forced to engage with. My mom sitting in the corner chair, feigning a smile to the man before brining her fingernails back up to her teeth.\n\n“‘My names Doctor Aaron, and I’ve heard we’ve made a new friend have we?” the doctor spoke as he fitted his stethoscope into his ears.\n\n“Yeah, but mom doesn’t believe me.” I said, exaggerating my words in typical childlike frustration.\n\nI grew irritated just thinking of the situation. I had told her about the figure, and after stating she had not seen anyone multiple times, my anger flared as I screamed and continuously pointed in its direction. Tired of my attitude, she had walked next to the tree in Danny’s yard where the figure was standing, side by side with it, throwing her hands up in impatience. She saw nothing, but in my eyes she was being a jerk to my friend.\n\nHis nod showed an understanding that calmed me slightly, as the cold surface of the scope was placed on my chest. After the usual breathing instructions, his brow furrowed slightly.\n\n“You’re not feeling nervous are you Shelly, there’s nothing to be afraid of here. See look.” He said, pointing up the dozen or so children’s drawings taped above the patient bed, some being appreciation notes written in sloppy crayon.\n\n“Plenty of kids just like you sat in here, and all walked out right as rain! So It’s pretty cool you’re here you know, it takes a strong girl to work up the bravery to go get medicine herself, yuck!” He said, scrunching his face and smiling. I laughed and smiled alongside him, feeling more and more comfortable with Doctor Aaron as the visit went on.\n\nI don’t remember much of the specifics of those visits, but I was eventually diagnosed with clinical anxiety. Fear and worry weren’t exactly what I’d call my emotions at that age, but with excessive irritability and refusal to be separated from others at all times, it was a safe bet. Not to mention the figure, to them being a creation of my mind which gave me an unhealthy, hypersensitive paranoia to my surroundings. How could it be paranoia? She was always in the same place. Behind me.\n\nWhenever I had mentally acknowledged her, she would freeze in place, allowing me to turn around and gaze at her. As a child, this was a rare occurance, due to the immense distance alongside the many other things in my small mind. I essentially summoned her when I wanted to, having to access a large open area to do so. But things changed. She got closer. Year by year, the distance slowly became shorter, with a pattern I hadn’t recognized until my 17th birthday.\n\n— — —\n\nI hadn’t wanted to be at that party that day, but you know how it goes. You’re friends with someone for so long they’re practically a part of you, alongside my raging hormones pushing me to make the stupidest decisions when I was around him. Danny’s house was bustling as always, his dad on his usual out of town business trips, with his mother no longer around, caught fucking a colleague at work by Danny himself. It happened a couple years ago, and he took it about as well as you’d expect any teenager to, refusing to open up about it and letting it consume him in more ways than one. But I loved him. Well, a teenagers idea of love, but he really was the only one I felt comfortable being with without losing control of my breathing and going into fits of panic. My mind being so infatuated with him that even “she” never appeared.\n\nThe bottles of beer began to pile up between the 8 of us in the living room as we passed the blunt around, a recording of the Blue Jays  and Phillies World Series silently playing on the TV as a track mix of Shai, Aerosmith and many others blasted throughout the room. Danny sat beside me, throwing comments back and forth with the guys about the various girls they hooked up with over the summer break, stopping me and my friend Madison’s conversation.\n\n“God really?” She said, flicking her cigarette and crossing her legs, smuggly wincing in disbelief.\n\n“How many times did you assault my parents basement with your dragons and dung jeans or whatever the hell that crap is.”\n\nSome laughed, others cursed, but Danny took it differently. He apparently had enough of hiding his internal frustrations, and allowed the alcohol and drugs to make it a challenge instead, performing an over the top movement of putting his hand on my leg, slightly under my skirt. I felt a tingle of excitement in my stomach as it was the intimacy I’ve been craving from him for so long, but it didn’t last.\n\n“What Maddie, you’re gonna pretend like you’re not craving one of us to break you in, nice and slow?” Danny said to her, slurring his words slightly but holding conviction in his tone. I didn’t get to see her reaction, as he reached his hand up between my legs.\n\nI can’t describe the pure fury and terror that overcame me, as I quickly threw his arm away and attempted to get up, only being stopped by his aggressive embrace. I felt my breathing rapidly increase as my sense of touch dissipated and my vision blacked out in a paranoid frenzy. All my body allowed me to do was listen, hearing erupting laughter from all the others along with the stereo lyrics blasting throughout my senses.\n\n\\*“I try to cross to the opposite side.”\\*\n\n\\*“So I can finally find what I’ve been looking for.”\\*\n\nDanny wasn’t my Danny anymore, a foreign entity at this point, causing me nausea and dizziness as my mind rapidly convinced my body I was in immense danger. Rage overtook me, and despite being a sobbing, shaking mess I blindly scratched and bit my way out of his grasp and frantically sprinted for the exit out of the house. I flung open the front door and tripped down the few concrete steps leading onto the yard, not feeling any sensation as the panic pushed me foward with my vision slowly returning to me. The darkness of the night branched out in front of me, and I realized I was completely alone for the first time since I was a child. \n\n\\*“In the middle of the night.”\\*\n\n\\*“I go walking in my sleep.”\\*\n\n\\*“Through the valley of fear.”\\*\n\n\\*“To a river so deep.”\\*\n\nThe sounds of the stereo and concerned cries for my name faded in the distance as I sobbingly walked down the main road with arms crossed, small streaks of blood smeared across them. No doubt Danny’s. As I walked, my eyes rapidly darted side to side observing every possible angle, my mind sending unexplainable waves of nausea and dread throughout my body as I struggled to even breathe.  Suddenly, my eyes widened and I swallowed a weak, shallow breath as I quickly turned around in a frantic motion of paranoia. There she stood a mere 35 meters away from me, illuminated by a ominous glow of a streetlight. A woman, dressed in a black gown, tilted backwards at a disturbing angle. Her head was completely laying backwards, which combined with the angle made it impossible to see anything aside from just her neck and dangling brown hair. Her left arm reached foward to me, as her right lays to her side dangling, but keeping with her impossibly tilted body.\n\nI’ve of course seen her before this point, far more frequently as the shorter distance makes it more reasonable for her to be visible. However I had just seen her yesterday, and she was \\*not\\* this close. That’s when I made the connection. It was my birthday.\n\n“What do you want from me!” I screamed with pure rage as tears flowed down my cheeks. The ever steady stillness of the figure did little to scare me at this point. I was angry with its existence. Angry I had to deal with it alone. I pushed foward rapidly as I clenched my fist ready to confront her face to face, but as always, she simply slid backwards at the same speed as me, making no body movements aside from her clothe and dangling hair. Upon seeing this again while in such a state, I screamed at the top of my lungs and began punching the asphalt of the street, blood splattering as pain was no longer present.\n\n“I’ll fucking kill you, you hear me! You’re not going to do this to me! I will fucking kill you before I let you torture me you bitch!” Followed by another scream as loud as I could. Of course, when I regained a slight bit of composure and stopped shaking enough to briefly sit up, there she stood, unmoving, as I turned around and walked home, holding my now fractured hand.\n\n— — —\n\nTime passed as my mother and I become more and more distant. Who could blame her really, she struggled with raising a sick daughter all by herself and her reward was an antisocial train wreck of a child attached to her like a leech.\n\nNothing prepares \\*anyone\\* for that. She was trapped in a cage of mental whiplash whenever she spoke with me, so pills were of course the next step for her.\n\nCaregiver syndrome is the most cruel, unintentional torture imaginable.\n\nBy the time I was in my mid 20’s, functioning with a job the best I could and finally comfortable enough to engage with others, my mother was lost to the distinct void of apathetic numbness that only the magic of modern medicine can provide.\n\nTime passed on as our weekly phone call moved to monthly, then to a couple a year, then to being as lost as she was. Needless to say none of this was benefitting my own numbness, the sense of impending dread as my curse drifted closer and closer, chiseling away my already catatonic willpower.\n\nIt felt as though an endless weight was lifted off my chest when she called one day and told me she was off her meds for over a month. Waves of nostalgia poured over me as I finally heard the familiar voice of my mother free from the shackles of addiction. I lived only a state away and in the past the drive had felt too quick, but this time I was bursting with relief ridden anxiety. It had been almost a decade at this point since I’ve seen her like I used to remember.\n\n\\*What would we talk about? What did functional women even care about? Was I going to disappoint her with my dead end job? Would she ask for grandchildren? Would she try to help me again? Oh god, what if she tries to help me again? Does she hate me?\\*\n\nNone of that mattered when I walked into that familiar house. After closing the front door behind me and turning the corner I froze rigid with needle like burns piercing my mind and body. Just across the room, on the other side of the round kitchen table sat a blurry figure in a wooden chair. Behind it was “her”.\n\n\\*No no no no no no no.\\*\n\n\\*Consistency is ALL I have, it’s all I EVER had, why is she in front of me.\\*\n\n\\*Fuck what is that blur.\\*\n\n\\*Oh god why. Why is she touching its shoulder.\\*\n\nThoughts battled in my head as I stood petrified, but then I heard the blurry figure speak. A bass filled muffled sound emitted from the sitting being, like the faint sound of talking a couple rooms away but far louder, shaking my entire body with every bizarrely imitated word.\n\nSeeing my curse so up close I noticed its middle and pointer finger pointing at me from its outstreched arm, palm seemingly resting on the blur’s shoulder. I saw graying hair among the shades of brown, and watched as she sprung upwards when the sitting figure stood up and laid down a cup on the table quickly.\n\n\\*I smelled coffee.\\*\n\n“Mom!?”\n\nMy blurred mother continued to imitate speech as she slowly approached me, arms upwards in a non threatening way.\n\nAll I saw however was that thing coming closer to me than it had ever before, my mind forcing my body to step backwards without letting it out of my sight. I felt my head go light and my eyes began to water, as the thud of my heartbeat reverberated in my dry throat.\n\n“No…” I croaked out in a heaving breathe.\n\n“God no, get off of her, please god get off of her…”\n\nMy eyes began to be sore from how wide they stared at the figures neck and chin, my forehead muscles begging for a release as I took a shuffling step backwards.\n\n“Please I beg you, let her go, take me… it’s always been me. For the love of god let her go, please.”\n\nThere was unwavering silence.\n\n“Please!”\n\nI screamed at it and felt the inevitable clog in my throat as the tears coated my horrified face. Once my mother took one more step towards me I felt every ounce of suppressed panic and fear I held against the figure flow into my chest as I bolted out the door, barely conscious. I quickly hopped in my car and slammed my foot downwards, taking off from the driveway and slamming my passenger side mirror into the mailbox. I needed to get away, for more than one reason. \n\nI looked backwards with intent once I was on the road, and much to my relief the figure was behind me again. My bargain had worked and she was away from my mother. I steadied my hyperventilating and braced for the drive home. I didn’t know what to do. If there even \\*was\\* anything to do.\n\nWhen I finally returned home, I found multiple voicemails from my mother. I paused for a second, glaring at the receiver before shakily hitting play. The muffled sounds burst loudly from the machine as I screamed and fell over from pain, a mistake I quickly regretted as the horrible sounds invaded my entire apartment as I laid helplessly on the ground in a ball.\n\nIt sounded like imitated crying. My mother overdosed two days later.\n\n— — —\n\n“It killed her Aaron, I told you…”\n\n“Okay Shelly, I understand. Look, let’s just meet up so we can talk and get your mind off of it, for old times sake.”\n\nI paused for a couple seconds.\n\n“Just talk, for old times sake right?” I murmured.\n\n“Of course Shelly. Like I said, I’m not a physician anymore but I’d like to think I \\*am\\* your friend.” He said in an optimistic tone.\n\n“Okay.”\n\nNo one can blame him for how overly cautious he spoke to me on the phone. I was a checked out recluse for months after my mother died and for all he knew I was just a ticking bomb myself, primed to ignite at the slightest nudge. But Doctor Aaron cared, he always did.\n\nI can’t imagine how he felt when he saw me stumble into the quaint diner outside of the city. This 30 something woman he last saw as a child, meekly approaching his table while gazing to her sides in paranoia. Though despite my rough appearance, I couldn’t be happier to just talk to someone about nothing important. I could never form new bonds later in my life, so all I really had was my past.\n\n“Hello Doctor Aaron.” I said sheepishly while smiling, taking a seat across from him in the booth.\n\nI saw a familiar glow spread across his now wrinkled face.\n\n“Shelly, it’s so great to see you. It really is.” He said with the gentlest smile.\n\nI suddenly felt guilty making him meet me in a place like this instead of coming to his house to meet his family. After what happened at my old home I felt like my already fragile sense of reality crumbled, with the slightest drop of my guard inviting more instability.\n\nThere really was no winning, because once my guard was dropped my brain would thrust “her” into my memory, but I had a lifetime of experience pushing her into the few guarded places still lingering in my subconscious. Aaron and I had a great dinner together while he discussed his daughter’s pregnancy and how much that had happened in my neighborhood over the years. It was a beautiful, melancholic evening as we watched the cars drive down the interstate through the large diner window beside us.\n\nOf course, I faltered for a brief moment.\n\nJust once when the thought of her came into my mind, I caved in and looked behind me. There she floated, towards the entrance of the diner. I loathed that she was inside of buildings with me now, they were such a welcome sanctuary for so much of my apprehensive life. As I turned back around to face the table, hardly phased by her grotesque image, Aaron had taken notice. My heart caught in my throat as my eyes opened wide.\n\n\\*No no no no no.\\*\n\nAaron’s warm demeanor changed to a professional charisma.\n\n“Shelly, I know this therapist that speciali-“\n\nThe overwhelming bass shook my body as my ears began ringing in the highest pitch imaginable. A blur of muted colors sat 2 feet in front of me as her dead skin and dangling hair violently manifested behind it.\n\nI screamed, so loud that the blur covered it’s ears and imitated a scream as well. An immense sensation of burning bile swam up my body as I began vomiting the little food I ate all over the table and leaned towards the window of the diner, my head desperate to overcome the dizziness. I wish it hadn’t.\n\nAfter a couple of slow blinks, the blurry figure was now in the booth with me and had its hand on my shoulder, but all I saw in my peripheral were two pale fingers and her thrown back head towering above me. \n\nMy brain gave out and I began to thrash wildly as a dizzying heat embraced all of my limbs, punching and clawing anything near me, begging for her to get away. With both my brain and body confined in that cramped booth, in pure horror and desperation I punched at the diner window to break it to no avail. With my sense of touch being devoured from intense panic, the last thing I felt was the blurred Aaron grasping my arms viciously. My vision rapidly dimmed from my brain’s overstimulation in the moment, so I did the only thing I could think of, slamming my head into the window before I could be forced to witness how close she was to me.\n\nNaturally, I woke up in the hospital a day later. Aaron had left me a voicemail when I eventually returned home, and despite what had happened the first time I did so, I promptly pressed the play button.\n\n“I’m uh… worried about you of course.” Aaron’s monotone voice came to life in my apartment.\n\n“Yeah, I’m sure you know you need help. I believe everything can be treated but I’m hesitant to offer… solutions considering all that’s happened with your mother and the uh… well yeah.”\n\nI watched the receiver with a blank stare, my chest feeling just as barren.\n\n“This’ll be the last time you hear from me, good luck Shelly.”\n\nI didn’t budge for half an hour as I stood staring, my labored breathe breaking the now silent atmosphere. \n\nI had heard his voice clear. He really was done wanting to help. Thank god, for his sake. Thank god.\n\nAnd so I went on the next 6 or so years of my life numb, disconnected and alone. Aside from her of course. Always occupying the room with me at this point, no mental willpower would ever keep her isolated as she now lingered only a couple of feet behind me. If I turned too fast when I wasn’t indulging her, I’d see her hair flying sideways in the corner of my vision, forcing me to acknowledge. Violently stopping in place a couple feet away. Pointing at me. Leaned backwards as always.\n\nThe depression was an endless, nauseating void that engulfed me and stole away what little comfortability and passions I had ever had. I’d sit in the corner of the room, sometimes to force her into the wall behind me, or sometimes after thinking of her so I could stare at her in the middle of the room for hours, numb and consumed in self pity.\n\nI had crashed my car the day after one of my birthdays when I realized she was now in my backseat, constraining me into jobs closer to my place so I could walk to work. Compared to now, it was still possible to make an attempt at a functional life. That was until my next birthday, when her outstretched fingers are now just out of reach from my elbow. \n\nI was \\*finished\\* then.\n\nThis year I haven’t worked or done much of anything at all, I’ve succumbed to it like I always knew would inevitably happen. It just came quicker than expected you know? Somehow. But then I found salvation.\n\nWhile walking home after getting groceries, I smiled emptily when I saw the black gown in the display window.\n\n— — —\n\nAt least I picked something comfortable I guess.\n\nShe never killed my mother, I did. That woman was my rock when I needed her most, but I couldn’t be there for her when she needed me. Hell, I was the cause of it all. I’m so sorry mom. She hid you from me because you really did want to help, even after you suffered detoxing alone. Even after I screamed and ran from you. I’m so, so sorry. \n\nI keep looking down at the thing’s hand, and finally just now realized what it’s doing with its fingers.\n\nIt’s all pretty obvious in hindsight isn’t it. The fact my hair prematurely grayed out due to constant anxiety. That I had to learn to use a mouse left handed when computers first got popular due to my self inflicted fractured right hand. None of this makes any sense and frankly that’s okay. She was never real, but I made her real with my decisions, and finally accepted her with that bottle of sleeping pills I took.\n\nI’m looking at my arms as I slowly feel my body bracing, the sensation of heaviness consuming them as I type this out. I can’t help but visualize my right arm drooping down to my side as I slump backwards here soon. Man, clicking the post button really \\*is\\* the last thing I’m ever going to do.\n\nFunny, I can’t stop thinking about Danny. Life was so much better back then when I didn’t know death was coming closer.",

        "text": "Living on a secluded farm had always made me feel safe. But one night, my sense of security was shattered. My wife and I had decided to install motion sensor porch lights to add an extra layer of protection during late nights. It was a smart decision, or so we thought.\n\nOne fateful night, we went to bed later than usual, around 12:21 AM. Our bedroom was situated above the porch, with a large window facing the front yard. As I began to doze off, the motion sensor light suddenly went off. I didn't think much of it and went back to sleep.\n\nHours passed, and I woke up at 4:43 AM. I noticed that the porch light was still on. At first, I wasn't too concerned, as the sensor was highly sensitive and could be triggered by something as tiny as a fly. But something felt off this time. My wife was also awake and whispered to me, \"It's been on for three hours.\" My heart raced as I felt a sense of extreme dread fill me.\n\nI slowly made my way to the window and peered out. I saw a figure standing outside, facing away from the house. How could someone be here? We lived far from any civilization. The figure was too still to be human, and as I focused my gaze, I noticed something that sent shivers down my spine - the figure had no face.\n\nI was paralyzed with fear, unable to take my eyes off the faceless figure. I couldn’t move, It was facing the other way, yet I felt its eye peering into me, It felt like an eternity before my wife told me to call 911. As I turned to do so, the motion sensor turned off.\n\nI didn't know whether to panic or feel relieved, but the faceless figure was gone. It was only then that I realized I had left the front door unlocked. I was paralyzed once again, I tried to move but I couldn’t, my children slept in the room across ours. The thought of an intruder wandering through my home, especially one with no face, filled me with a sense of dread I had never experienced before.\n\nDays passed, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still watching me. I became increasingly paranoid, unable to leave the house or sleep without the lights on. I scoured the internet for any information that could help me understand what had happened that night. And that's when I found it - a local legend about a faceless man who would haunt anyone who dared to enter his territory.\n\nI couldn't believe it - had I unknowingly trespassed on his land? Had I brought this upon myself? I knew I had to act fast, but it was already too late. The faceless man had already claimed me as his next victim, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I was trapped, alone with my thoughts, and the faceless man waiting just outside my door.",

        "text": " \n\nPRF: 23\n\nRSTFR: 03MO111420\n\nMy grandma is gone.\n\nShe lives in the countryside, sort of. She’s not living outside but she definitely doesn’t live in a village or town or anything that would classify as a community. She lives in an old nipa hut styled house. Unlike the town I lived in, her house was in a perpetual paradise where the only season was sun or sun with a side of rain unlike the perpetual winter that enveloped our community.. For that reason, my parents preferred to leave me with her during weekdays when they had to work overtime at the company or when they went on work trips. My parents were workaholics, or maybe they just had a love for science so large that when they got a project assigned to them, they lost track of time trying to resolve it. This led them to come home at ungodly hours and they were worried about me staying all by myself until the early morning hours so bringing me to my grandma’s became a normal routine for us.\n\nThe house itself was built before my mom was even born, which raises a lot of concerns regarding safety but the countless renovations that it has undergone provided me with a bit of assurance that I won’t fall through the floors. It was surrounded by acres of rice paddies, from time to time we’ll catch a glimpse of the farmers working there, that doesn’t happen often though. It was a little bit peculiar seeing as no other houses were around. To young me, it seemed as though the farmers would appear out of thin air, I’m sure that’s not the case but it’s funny looking back at it now.\n\nThe rice paddies have their own irrigation system and every morning, as soon as the sun rises, you’ll see my grandma’s house, a steampunk looking contraption appearing to float on the water-filled fields.\n\nThe first thing you’ll see when you walk into her house is a bulky CRT television, two antennas sticking out from the pink radio beside it. It was placed on a metal table painted white, a stack of magazines underneath it, slightly concealed by the floral patterned tablecloth my grandma drapes on it. The couch was a short distance away from it, a wooden couch with some floral designed cushions. My grandma sewed those herself, the same fabric she used to make the table cloth.\n\nThe wooden floors shine even in dim lighting, this would partly be because my grandmother never lets us wear shoes in the house and partly because she waxes it twice a week. On the left side of the house was the “bedroom”, a set of curtains, hung on some wire, acting as the divider. The bedroom consisted of two mattresses and a huge wooden cabinet. The cabinet had white doors, painted with colourful fairies and children and what looked like a waterfall, while the rest of it was a bright turquoise. It was pushed against the farthest wall, the bottom drawers blocked by the two mattresses that lay on the floor.\n\nThere was a small kitchen and dining area right behind the TV. The kitchen had a mini fridge inside one of the cabinets and a two burner countertop stove. There was an opening right above the sink, covered with some screen and chicken coop mesh to keep the bugs and other animals outside. The dining area had a small square-shaped table with some monoblock chairs stacked on the side, right beside it was an old aluminium screen door, the screen had a few holes in it which my grandma covered up with some duct tape.\n\nSometimes when it’s raining, you’ll hear the winds blowing against this door and the raindrops hitting the screen, during those times, the rain splatters onto the wooden dining table my grandma keeps near it.\n\nMy grandma had an outhouse. A small square that houses a toilet (which didn’t have a flush), a faucet and the red pail and tumbler we used to take showers. It wasn’t a big space, the room was only 2 by 2 metres large. The bathroom lay flat on the ground, unlike the hut which was hoisted around half a metre off the ground. This meant that it wasn’t ideal to use the bathroom in the early morning or when it has been raining non stop because the bathroom floor is almost always going to be flooded with water. The outhouse is located at the back of her house. To reach it, you had to walk through the aluminium screen doors and onto this descending bridge. It was made of bamboo shoots, laid side by side and tied together, there was a railing made of the same bamboo, placed about one and a half metres off the ground, some old black trawls lining the area beneath it, a safety net of sorts.\n\nWhen I was younger, I had always been afraid of that area. I was afraid of everything outside my grandma’s house to be honest. I’ve always had trouble sleeping even as a child, and whenever I would have my bouts with insomnia, I would often turn on the TV and clear my mind. Listening to the advertisements roll, sort of like a lullaby, watching the flickering of the different colours bouncing throughout the room, resembling a dysfunctional rainbow. Oftentimes, this would be enough to make me sleep.\n\nMy grandma had a collection of gems embedded onto the concrete of her wall. Decoration, my mom says. My grandma would look at me and wink whenever mom said this. Grandma says it’s for protection. I say it served both purposes. When the sun’s rays seep through the screen meshes, the kaleidoscope on her wall lights up the whole house. It was pretty, pretty enough that I would be content to look at it in awe for a few minutes. At night, when the fields outside my grandma’s house would fall into silence, it acted as protection; made me feel strangely safe even with the lack of locks on my grandma’s doors.\n\nMy grandma’s house had a basement. The door to the basement was found in the backside of her house, hidden amongst the tall stalks of rice; a few centimetres right of the bridge to her outhouse. The door was made of metal, corroded and rusted from the constant flooding; no handles to open it. For as long as I’ve known, this door has never been opened; can’t be even when we tried. It was stuck to its frame, the effect of the rust, flooding and being unopened for decades.\n\nAt some point, my parents stopped bringing me to my grandma. I asked them about it and was told that since I started attending classes, they didn’t have to worry about me being home alone all day anymore and I was too busy to question it. Recently, I got my access permit and I was able to drive by my grandma’s house. I thought I got lost despite following the map because unlike my memory, the rice paddies were dry, almost like a drought had taken place. The stilts on my grandma’s house were exposed by the lack of water flooding the paddies and also the wilted stalks which had sagged to the ground. There were some farmers chopping at the stalks, claering the field it seems.\n\nThe front door was open and I rushed inside to find her house exactly as it had been all those years ago with dust covering every surface. Grandma's gems weren’t on her walls anymore. This was odd, I remembered how much she treasured those, even putting plastic wrap over top of it to make sure they never fell off. As I went outside to the bamboo bridge, I noticed a strange smell coming from the basement door. I was planning to check it out but I noticed some of the farmers had stopped chopping down the stalks and were directly looking at me. I stood still for a moment, feeling their unblinking stares and fear started to seep into me. I rushed into the house and out to my vehicle, turning my car around to drive away, one thought was all that was left in my mind. My grandma’s house was lonely.\n\nLOG: END\n\n23 MTR START",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11lfzci/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/)\n\nThe dream I had that night was the same as the first. I was trapped in an endless loop in those woods, eventually stalked by an unseen creature, and I woke up after it caught me. \n\nI woke up with a scream, to be specific. \n\nMy mother came rushing in. \n\n“What’s wrong Baby?” Yes, I was still called her Baby at nine, no that would not change with any number of years thereafter. \n\n“I was still in the woods!” I wailed. I couldn’t think of a better way to say it. I still can’t. \n\n“It’s okay, Baby. You’re not in the woods. You’re home.” She tried to comfort me, pulling me into a tight hug. “What happened in there? Was there anybody else in there with you?”\n\n“No. Not people. Just the thing. But I couldn’t see it.” \n\nA few years later, I would come to understand the significance behind her attempt to gently prod out if a human attacker was the source of my unusually traumatized reaction. \n\nInstead, my answer seemed to leave her still concerned but mostly placated that it was just an unusually strong nightmare.\n\nLife continued as normal for a while. I never fully forgot the incident. But, it’s hard for even something pretty bad to fully keep a nine year old down.\n\nI do think it made me even more of an introvert, just more distance between me and the world. It wasn’t huge, certainly. I would say I was basically normal, and the nightmares were gone, I hoped for good. \n\nThat wasn’t to be.\n\nThe next incident happened months later. School had let out and come back again. I have never been responsible about switching my schedule around and planning around getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne night, just after going back to school from summer break, I got determined to push through winning a video game. I had been floundering on the final fight for days. So, it was time to set in and do it. \n\nThose digital cambion twins humiliated me for hours, and hours more. By the time I finished, it was so far past late that the moment I crawled into bed, literally the very next moment the alarm went off pulling me up. \n\nI’m sure you don’t even need to imagine how exhausted I was. At that age, it wasn’t the constant dragging aches and exhaustion I feel now. I mostly could still pull through the day, but with fits of sleepiness hitting at the most unexpected moments. \n\nThat was what got me.\n\nI was sitting in one of my classes. Not so surprisingly, I couldn’t possibly tell you which subject it was. What I know is that only a few minutes in, I passed out. \n\nI didn’t even need to open my eyes. I smelled the rotting leaves. I felt the dirt encrusting my body. I was in my own personal hell yet again. \n\nI was in the woods. \n\nIt is hard for me to put the emotions I felt at that moment to words. The sheer existential dread that shook my body was devastating. I knew, in the deepest parts of my soul, that I had always been there. No matter how many months passed, I had never left those woods. \n\nEventually, I pushed myself up and looked around. I didn’t need to look at myself to know that I was the same age, in the same clothes as I was then. I mean that not just because it made sense. No, somehow I was the same child who had gotten lost in those woods. The time since was the hazy and indistinct part. \n\nI tried to reject that nightmare. I kept my eyes clenched shut. I cried until I had no tears left to shed. But the woods never changed. \n\nEventually, I stood up and walked. Resigned, but still terrified, I made no attempt to keep or choose any path. I knew it didn’t matter. I just needed to endure whatever the forest had in store for me. \n\nThe woods became dark much faster than before. It was as if it knew that it needed to change how it would torment me as I no longer held hope of just walking out. \n\nThe trees oppressively narrowed around me, trapping me tightly in what was almost a maze. Eventually, I could only follow the paths which split and formed ahead of me as the trees were so grown together that I could not push off-course even if I wanted to. \n\nThe way the trees transformed into a great wall of wooden flesh unsettled me. Branch veins and leaf hair blended into a hellish picture on the canvas of nature. \n\nI heard it coming. \n\nThe rustling of leaves came first. Then I could make out the stomping of feet. \n\nI ran. You have to remember, I was still a child, not meaningfully older than when I first found those woods. How was I supposed to deal with that? Panic pushed me forward. I knew well enough from last time that it could cause pain. \n\nThe forest canopy above me melted into blackness. The wall of trees looked like a stretched sheet of wooden skin. Only the forest floor remained oddly normal. \n\nA stench like burnt skin assaulted my nose. I could sense it getting near me. This time, it didn’t grab me in one fell swoop like before. Instead, many hands raked across my back and arms, weakly grasping me. I continued to struggle to run, but gradually the hands pulled me to the ground. \n\nThrashing and screaming, I struggled to break free of their grasp…\n\n-\n\nI fell out of my desk. \n\nEvery set of eyes in that classroom was on me. As far as anyone watching could see, I had just shrieked and flung myself out of my desk. \n\n“What’s wrong?” Being in elementary school, the question was far more concerned than annoyed. \n\n“Where-?” Slowly, the memory of where I actually was came back to me. \n\n“Come on. You’re going to see the nurse.”\n\nI was promptly taken away. Understandably, the teacher wanted to offload the problem before a room full of elementary children went out of control.\n\nI did actually explain my problem to the nurse. That got me an appointment with counselors. I would have loved it if an adult could have given me answers. \n\nInstead, after thorough questioning about my home life, I got my mother called about my “nightmare problem” and nothing more to show for it.\n\nI knew my problems ran deeper though. These were not dreams. Having another incident so far detached from my trip into that forest made me certain of it. \n\nI shouldn’t have been capable of feeling every sensation, seeing every detail, and thinking with total clarity in a dream. No dream feels that real. \n\nThat incident left me with no ability to pretend that this was a single freak accident. Something had happened in those woods, and it wasn’t going to just leave me behind. \n\nI was too young to do anything about it though. I felt powerless. So I did what I had to: I lived with it.",

        "text": " \n\n So I'm gonna start this at where all my bad luck started. I found this footage in the forest near my house. It was lying in a small clearing, surrounded by broken trees and trampled bushes. The camera seemed to be still recording, and when I played it, I saw a horror story unfold before my eyes. It was the found footage of a man who encountered all types of cryptids and met his gruesome end. And now, I fear that the same fate may befall me, as the creatures in the footage are now hunting whoever finds it.\n\n The footage begins with the man, who introduces himself as Jason, filming his journey into the forest. He explains that he is a cryptozoologist and is on a mission to document the existence of various cryptids. At first, his journey seems to be uneventful, with only the sounds of the forest accompanying him. But as the sun starts to set, things start to get strange.\n\n Jason hears strange noises in the distance, and the camera picks up something moving through the trees. He follows the sounds until he comes across a clearing, where he sees a large, hairy creature rummaging through some bushes. Jason is excited and terrified at the same time. He realizes that this is the moment he has been waiting for, the chance to document an unknown species.\n\n Over the next few days, Jason encounters several other cryptids, each one more terrifying than the last. He manages to capture footage of each one, but they all seem to be following him. He sees a Chupacabra, with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth, a Mothman, with large, leathery wings, and a Jersey Devil, with horns and razor-sharp claws. Each time he sees one, he runs and hides, hoping that he won't be caught.\n\n But the creatures are getting closer, and Jason knows that he is running out of time. He starts to panic, and his footage becomes shaky and erratic. He sets up traps and tries to protect himself, but it's no use. The creatures are too powerful, and they know the forest better than he does.\n\n One night, Jason sets up camp in a clearing, surrounded by his traps. He thinks he's safe, but he's wrong. As he sleeps, the camera picks up something moving through the darkness. Suddenly, he wakes up to find himself surrounded by several cryptids. They are circling around him, growling and snarling.\n\nJason tries to escape, but the creatures are too fast for him. He screams and shouts for help, but no one can hear him. He picks up his camera and starts to film the creatures, hoping that someone will find the footage and know what happened to him.\n\n But as he films, the creatures get closer and closer. The camera falls to the ground, and all we can hear are Jason's screams. The footage ends there, and I am left with a feeling of dread.\n\nAs I try to make sense of what I just saw, I hear something moving outside. I grab my flashlight and my camera and head out into the forest. But as I walk, I realize that I'm not alone. Something is following me, something that wants the footage back. I try to run, but I know it's too late. The creatures are too powerful, and they won't stop until they get what they want.",

        "text": "I have tried to vent and confess on Reddit but am accused of being a troll. I cannot confess anywhere else because I don’t want to go to jail even though I’m pretty sure I can’t at this point….. but the guilt that’s eating at me is worse than jail.  \n\nI abused my daughter for 15 years. I had her young and her father left us and wanted nothing to do with the situation whatsoever. I ended up resenting her for it. I was young. I shouldn’t have been a mother. And I shouldn’t have put myself in that situation.  I have tried to apologize to her but she doesn’t think it’s genuine since I never mentioned the details of the things but I’m going to detail them here to let it off my chest. \n\nFrom the ages of 1-3 \n\n* this was the worst time for my mental health and and unfortunately I took it out on her. We shared a bed and sometimes when she’d take the blanket off me, or move around too much, I’d get so angry and put her in a dark hallway with a pillow and blanket on the floor. She was scared of the dark but too small to turn on the light switch. She would scream and cry and beg for my grandma. \n* I would leave her in the living room late at night while I would have sex with men. \n* One of my ex’s had a dog and she was allergic to them at the time. She got an asthma attack , hives, ect and had to go to the hospital because she was having issues breathing. I still continued to let him bring the dog over because I wanted the company. \n* Sometimes my ex’s would be rude or nasty to her. Grab her arm ect. \n* I would spank her and pull her hair but nothing too bad to cause a mark. \n\nAs she got older (7-14) and I got married to an unstable man, I took out my frustrations on her whenever he left. I made her take on a parental role when he left and came back. I had her change diapers, wake up sometimes in the middle of the night to give bottles, ect. I threw a shitty diaper at her but she ran and missed it. \n\n* I had control issues because of my mental illness and monitored everything she did. How much toilet paper she used. How much soap. Anything really. \n* I didn’t let her shower every day because I didn’t want to pay the high water bills. When she did shower it was for a few minuets and I would turn the water off with soap in her hair still. \n* I hid most of the food in the house in my bedroom closet. When she’d sneak the food I’d get so angry when I’d find wrappers and papers around the house. \n* I didn’t want her to mess up the sheets or the couches, so I made her sleep and eat on the floor for many years every night. \n* One day she put a chocolate in my thanksgiving turkey and I got so angry I shoved mayonnaise down her throat and face until she threw up. She has always had a sensitivity to mayonnaise and it was the only threat to get her to behave. \n* As punishment, I would throw her out in the hallway and threaten to unscrew the light bulbs. And tell her aliens or deamons were going to get her. \n* I would pull her hair so hard there was a lump.\n* I was too cheap to buy her pads. Bras. Deodorant. Soap. My mother had to. Or I let her use some of mine. \n* I let her have lice in her hair for over a year and didn’t want to help her because I was afraid I’d get it. She was almost 14 so I thought she was old enough to do it herself. It didn’t work and she had lice crawling on her forehead and eyebrows. \n\nI exposed her to things I shouldn’t have because of my nymphomania. Told her explicit details of my sex life with my ex husband and my past history. Didn’t remove very disgusting emails and pornography on the computer. And when she was younger, I would shake my boobs and dance naked in front of the mirror and sing because I thought it was funny. \n\nShe had a rabbit and I didn’t want to be bothered with the mess of it, so I put it in a dark laundry room with no windows and took out the lamp. It stayed in darkness but I figured rabbits in the wild live underground. I didn’t get her supplies my mother did. It ended up getting sick and filthy. Pissed blood and had a tumor. I gave it a bath without knowing rabbits couldn’t get wet and it convulsed and died. \n\nI’ve said very hurtful things to her. Told her I wish I never fucked her father. A loser. Told her she had a balloon face. More stretch marks than me. Cellulite. Would zoom in on pictures I took of her and point out her belly and thighs. She was bullied at school constantly and I would agree with what they said and tell her that’s why she had no friends. I was secretly jealous of her I guess. \n\nShe’s always had substance abuse issues and undiagnosed ADHD and was a difficult kid. I shouldn’t have acted like that. I should have done better parenting tools. I knew she was cutting herself but I didn’t care to get her help. \n\nWhen she was 14, she told me her and her 24 year old coach were kissing and I recently found out that it was way more than that. My heart broke. I didn’t think all of that happened. \n\nI have no idea where to start to make this right. She hates me. She is a kind person despite it all and has made a good life for herself. I kicked her out when she was 17 because she could not follow my rules, and smoked weed in front of my other children. She didn’t have a car or a bank account or a job. I was expecting her to fail so she’d come back and finally listen. But she didn’t. And the guilt is destroying me. What do I even do.",

        "text": "When you have a skill in life it’s often in your best interest to put that skill to work in a field you’ll thrive in, and will gain the most benefit from. At the end of the day, despite how much we’d like to claim  otherwise, it doesn’t matter how good or bad of a person you are. All that matters is what you're capable of, and how much power that capability can bring you. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not a good person, simply a skilled one. Now that’s not to say I have no moral code, after all every professional needs  to set a standard for themselves, it’s what separates us from the bloodthirsty schmucks who wanna make a quick buck off of their bad habits. For starters no children, I mean christ I may be a gun for hire but even I have boundaries. No cruel or unusual punishment, it’s an execution not a torture session, I prefer quick and clean. I also prefer to know details about both whoever I'm working with, and whoever I'm being sent to take care of, to judge for myself if their actions deserve the consequences I bring. Of course if the clients pockets are deep enough I'm not against the no questions asked policy.\n\nIt’s one of these Clients that have brought me to writing this. A young woman with a vengeful rage and a loaded purse to rival bruce wayne who met by the name of Jess, likely not her real name but real names are never often given to begin with. When she hired me for the job we had met at some crappy bar in the middle of near nowhere. I had never met her before but yet she gave off a strange sense of deja vu, and I could already tell she didn’t choose the place for a couple of rounds and small talk before giving out the details, a point proven to me when I took a seat at the booth she was in and offered to buy her a drink as way to break the ice, only to be told she doesn’t drink alcohol. It soon became clear to me she chose the place due to her connections with it, being on a first name basis with the staff and what I assume to be regulars. I found this strange because despite choosing a location she was familiar with, her outfit would make you believe she was trying her hardest to hide her identity. A long coat, a large hat to keep whatever possible hair on her head hidden, and a pair of sunglasses so dark they almost swallowed the light. \n\nOne waiter in particular kept checking in on us, possibly a brother, maybe boyfriend I had thought. A tall pale lanky son of a bitch with shaggy hair and a gel’d goatee, who was surprisingly well dressed for a bartender in a back alley shithole. He kept asking things like if I was the guy, if she knew what she was doing, and other questions along those lines. Enough to conclude he was very aware of, and seemingly even in on the job. I tried to ask some questions about it all but she quickly made it clear she wasn’t there to share details about her life, simply give me a target, or I guess I should say targets\n\nIt was here things first started getting strange. I'm no rookie, I’ve dealt with my fair share of multi hit jobs, but with every past encounter I had a good enough amount of details before going in, but when I asked for the targets, she didn’t give me any, not even a single name. Simply a small post-it note with 2 room numbers for a hotel they had been staying at, rooms 714, and 833, along with the instructions to take the elevator up, claiming the cameras didn’t work on them. which also revealed where I’d be going. Not exactly alarming, but what was off was the location in question. A small town in Kerry, Ireland. It could damn near be considered an unnamed landmark, and for your safety, will remain just that. Now going overseas wasn’t the concerning part, this job has taken me all over the world, to all different towns in all different countries…but never the same town in one of those different countries, let alone a place this small and underpopulated, and especially not…not that town. her minimalist way of dealing with the situation, along with that rather off putting coincidence was causing me to have my second thought on the whole job. That’s, of course, when she showed me just how deep her pockets were. With that, along with a rather hefty downward payment, it wasn’t long until I found myself on a private jet with little more questions. \n\nWhen I arrived at the hotel my targets were both located in, it was immediately apparent how out of place the building was. A 10 story modern 5 star Atlantic city style hotel and casino, right in the middle of what can best be described as a shanty fishing town. granted It had been years since I had seen the place, and I was only there for two days, not exactly for sight seeing either, quite frankly I tried to forget the time spent in this town…but anyways, the point is it didn’t look like much else had gotten any renovations. It was like a bright shiny palace surrounded by little log cabins. It boggled my mind to the point I had to stop a few feet from the door to think about what this titan of capitalism was doing in a place with maybe 50 residents, tops. I began to think perhaps my client had a hand in the place’s construction. She certainly had the funds for the project, and it could explain how she knew both the elevator cams were busted, and two separate targets were staying in the same place. If only I knew how right I was, probably would’ve turned around and left…Then again perhaps what followed was for the best. \n\nInstead I chalked it up to some business partners she grew some bad blood with and wanted out of the picture, so I shrugged it off and entered the hotel. As soon as I entered I noticed, much like the hotel’s appearance in this town as a whole, everything looked out of place. The lobby, bar, and gambling area, while still nice, were more fitting of the 1920s, right down to the staff uniforms and music. Even the restaurants and shops were thrown through a time machine, and given a historical theme like cowboys, vikings, WWII soldiers, and ancient pharaohs . I swear it felt like the history channel was smacking me across the face. After a few moments of admittedly getting lost in this maze of confusion, along with possibly trying my hand at a game of blackjack or two…or three, I finally found myself to the elevator, and began making my way to my first target, Room 714. As the elevator doors opened I quickly stepped in and went to press the button for floor seven, but as I did I noticed the elevator had been one giant wall of mirrors, and staring back at me was my reflection…my reflection from about 20 years ago.\n\nI slowly approached the elevator wall as it began to ascend. I was undoubtedly looking at myself, and it was undoubtedly a reflection coping my motions and facial expressions, but the me I was looking at was one from years ago. My hair was longer, and much darker. My face had far less facial scruff, and fewer scars. I was so mind fucked by what I was looking at I had completely failed to notice the elevator had stopped to pick up someone else…until they spoke to me. \n\n“So this is how it ends, huh Jackie-boy?” A gruff, male voice said to me from behind. It was a line I had heard multiple times in my head, mostly when I try to go to sleep. Before I could even think I was reaching for my gun. I didn’t even want to, my body just moved on its own to draw my weapon, turn around, and place it under the chin of…Dante. A mentor to me of sorts, one who took me in at around 13 after he caught me trying to lift a pack of smokes off him at a gas station off of 8 mile. taught me almost everything I know.  Not exactly a shining example of a parental figure, but still a hell of a lot better than the drug fueled, wannabe street gangsters I used to call mom and dad. We worked together almost 15 years, until of course he ended up crossing some real powerful people we were employed to at the time. Once he was found out he had to be dealt with. This was a personal matter though. We couldn’t let some outside man deal with him, if someone in the family stabs the rest in the back, it’s up to the family to return it, and the higher ups saw this as an opportunity to test my loyalty, but more importantly, to absolve me of any suspicions to being an accomplice, by giving the job to me.\n\nI tried to stop myself, drop the gun, tell him to run, but just like when it went down that night all those years ago, I didn’t do any of that. He flashed one last, smug prideful grin before my fingers pulled the trigger, and a bullet sprayed the inside of his skull across the elevator walls.  Much unlike that night however…he didn’t stop talking, despite having half his jaw blown off. He grabbed the barrel of the gun still resting under his chin, before twisting what was left of his mouth back into that smug grin, a thick silver substance spilling out the corners of it. “Killin a man with his own iron? That’s cold Jackie, real cold.” He said with a sinister laugh. His face was left completely mangled from the bullet, but his words were no less clear than when he was alive, as he continued to speak. “Looks like you took my lessons to heart huh kid?” He asked, almost mockingly, as his grip tightened around the barrel. “At the very least, you took lesson 1 to heart…Now this hole you just put through my brain here is leaving my memory a little foggy. So you mind reminding me what that lesson was again?” He asked in an overly sarcastic tone \n\nAll I could do was stand there in a wave of confusion and fear as the dead man began to laugh in my face, that thick silver sludge spewing onto my face with each gargled cackle. It had the consistency and smell of house paint, but it was warm and tasted like a coppery flavor I’ve grown accustomed to in this line of work, blood. I was broken from my state of shock by Dante as he continued to push his line of questioning. “C’mon kid don’t get soft on me now, answer the question.” He demanded, a sharp hiss in his voice that sounded almost inhuman. I was able to steady my shaky hand and calm myself before taking a deep breath. “Trust only yourself.” I replied trying to hide any emotion. His quickly rotting grin stretched even wider, causing patches of flesh  to tear and release more silver blood. “ Atta boy!” he cheered out, a twisted sense of pride filling his voice. Moments after he spoke those final words a soft ‘ding’ filled the elevator, and as if on queue, the moment the sound faded Dante’s living corpse dropped to the ground and went limp as the elevator doors slowly began to open, bringing me face to face with a large oak door, the numbers 714 deeply carved in. \n\nMy first thought was to make my way back down the elevator and get the fuck out of this place. No amount of money was worth continuing whatever it was I just witnessed, however I quickly came to learn this place wouldn’t let me leave that easily as I rushed to the elevator buttons to find them all gone, nothing but a smooth golden panel in their place. It was soon made clear finding a stairway was also out of the question, as stepping out revealed the only door on this entire floor was the one in front of me, all other rooms and exits seemingly sealed off by some sort of black brick. After about ten minutes of trying to find a way out, I realized the only thing I could do was move forward, so I took a deep breath, readied my weapon, and grabbed the doorknob. I didn’t even get to turn it, the moment my hand touched the handle everything went dark, and when I came to I found myself seated at a bar counter.\n\nI quickly began observing my surroundings and it didn’t take long for me to realize where exactly this bar was. A safe haven of sorts for hit men and mercs, hidden in the heart of Vegas, and the closest thing to a work place I’ve ever known. Despite the fact I knew the place like the back of my hand, it would be made clear to me this was only my first visit to the place as I felt a rough but playful pat on the back, and an all too familiar voice speaking cheerfully from the stool to my left. “Told you I'd bring you up to the big leagues kid, and what a hell of a way to make an entrance eh!?” I looked over to see Dante once more, this time slightly younger, and far more alive. “taking out the fuckin Esticardo twins, those drug smuggling fuck wits were the biggest pains in the ass this place had.” He went on, the whiskey breath making it clear he had been doing his fair share of celebrating. Before I could even begin to explain myself another voice joined in…her voice. \n\n“He’s not wrong, you’ve definitely earned your spot here with that little stunt.” a woman's voice said from across the bar. I quickly looked back to see a short brunette covered in bright tattoos pouring a shot of Jack in front of me. A soft smile painted across her face, and piercing green eyes that struck you with a strange dangerous blend of caution, and temptation…She really was just as beautiful as I remember. “Jackie-boy, this is Miss Natalia Shadengale. Best bartender in this whole sinful desert, and what a rack on this one one eh!?” Dante let out in another drunken cheer before being abruptly cut off by a 9mm handgun to his temple. “And don’t forget, the girl who doesn’t put up with old pervs bullshit.” she said with a cheeky smirk before slowly returning the gun back under the counter. She definitely wasn’t lying, she didn’t put up with anyone’s shit, except mine for some reason, and for once I found someone who brought me out of my shell, made me experience more to life than trading heads for checks. She was the first and only woman I have or will ever call my lover, and she remained that for 4 years. 4 golden years of me and her. Our own place, date nights, hell we even got a dog. We were far from a normal couple, but for someone like me, there was nobody else in this world who could bring a sense of normalcy to it but natalia, and it was the closest thing to perfect someone like me could wish for…then she got pregnant. \n\nShe was nothing but smiles, struck hard by baby fever. We spent the whole night dancing, partying, browsing through baby names, the whole nine yards. Even when we finally got to bed she spent hours going on and on about how she wanted them to look. “They have to have my eyes, no acception.” “If it’s a boy I bet he’ll grow up super tall” “I bet we would have the cutest girl” “you don’t think they’ll get bullied do you?” it wasn’t until about 2am she finally drifted off to sleep…and that’s when I left. You can judge me all I want, quite frankly I hope you do. I’ve done a lot of fucked up things in my life, and stained my hands with a lot of blood. Nothin felt worse than walking out of that door, but I couldn’t stay. My job brings a lot of enemies, their lives would be in danger, but it’s the only thing I know. I didn’t even go to pre school, and i’ve had more than enough run ins with the law to stop me from getting any real job that could support a family, plus I just…I couldn’t risk it if the kid turned out like me. I just wasn’t fit to be a dad, and I didn’t have the heart to tell her. So I just left, without a word. Not even a fucking letter, just a stack of unmarked bills on the coffee table. The plan was to never see her again, go completely off her radar…unfortunately I was only half right.\n\n“I’m-fuck kid, fuck i’m sorry. I didn’t know…Jackie you know if I knew it was her I would’nt have-fuck Jackie i’m sorry kid” Before I could reminisce on the happier memories anymore I was brought back to reality by Dante once more, his voice trembling…As we stood over Natalias body, A bullet hole directly centered over her heart, thick silver blood pouring out, almost illuminating the dark kitchen. It didn’t take me long to realize where I was, as much as I tried denying it. A small cottage in the same town that god forsaken hotel stood, the night a hit was placed on Natalia for how loose her lips were about some of the business that happened at the vegas bar after leaving…and the night Dante and I had been hired to handle a rat from the same bar. We weren’t given a name or face, Just a location and a large amount of money in cash, up front from someone we considered a close partner. Before I could pray not to, I heard it. The small traumatized cry of a child. I could feel tears flood my face as I turned around to meet the equally tearful gaze of a little girl, no more than 7 or 8. dark curly brown hair just as messy as her fathers, and piercing green eyes just as beautiful a her mothers, eyes overflowing with tears as she pleaded to know who I was, and what we did to her mom. As I began to break down completely I was swiftly dragged out by the arm as Dante began babbling various forms of “sorrys” and “fuck” while we ran for the woods. \n\nIt wasn’t for a couple hours until Dante spoke again while I was busy vomiting through my tears, nothing more than a sobbing mess in a pile of dirt and branches. “Never wanted to see you like this again kid…get why you shot me.” He muttered solemnly. I slowly looked up to see he looked much like he did moments before I exited the elevator, however the process of decay had seemed to take hold of him at a rapid pace. Flesh eaten away by rot to reveal muscle and bone, that silver blood now stale. More akin to frozen than stale really. Shiny, silver icicle-like shards hung off his face and surrounded his wounds. “Eye, for an eye and all that. Then again her bloods on your hands just as much as it was on mine.” He continued as a small smirk began to spread across his decaying lips. “No, no stop trying to fuck with me! You were the one who always had an itchy fucking trigger finger you old bastard! You shot her! you shot the moment you saw something move! that’s how you always fucking shot!” I yelled, lashing out in a symphony of rage, grief, and denial, only to be met with a calm sigh “Kid I've had more than enough time in this place to make my peace with the devils we danced with on this, and every other night. Never gonna truly forgive myself for it, but I’m able to accept it, and it’s time you do too.” He said, slowly taking a seat on a nearby rock as he Fished out a pack of smokes from his breast pocket, quickly lighting one and taking a long deep drag before continuing.\n\n“I pulled that trigger, you're right, but you’re the one who decided to take the job, with no information on the target. I gave you the wheel on this one and you had your eyes set on that pile of unmarked Ben Franks, and it led us here. Someone put a bounty on her head, and we decided to collect the reward, plain and simple kid. whether we knew it was her head we were collecting or not, it doesn’t matter now. Hindsight doesn't mean shit in our occupation son. Can't change the past, all you can do now is make peace with it as best you can.” He said, looking at me with more emotion than I thought dead eyes could show, before taking another long drag. I slowly stood up and began brushing the dirt and puke off of me, before looking at him again. “Who are you?” I asked cautiously. \n\nHe laughed through a puff of thick smoke before looking back at me. “Damn kid, how much of my face you paint across the walls?” he asked in that overly sarcastic tone I’ve come to miss hearing after all these years, taking another quick drag before continuing. “It’s really me Jackie. I ain’t some spirit, or demon, guardian angel, magic elf whatever the fuck else fantasy creatures you can think of, or hell maybe I am. Quite frankly I don’t know what I am now…” he began to trail off, a vast wave of emotions running across his face before recomposing himself. “The point is, whatever you are talking to right now is still the same old man who taught you how to hold a gun, and your liquor.” he finished with another small laugh as he put his smoke out and stood up, staring up to the night sky, speaking once more in a tone with such clarity that for a brief moment I completely forgot everything I had just gone through “When I first got here, the only thing I could think of was slitting your skinny fucking throat with a rusty pocket knife. The boy I take in under my roof, AND my wing, putting a bullet through my head with my favorite .45, and trust me I got to relive those final moments plenty of times…but then I got to relive other moments…” He looked at me, tears slowly falling from his long dead eyes. \n\n“Closest thing I had to a son, hell closest thing I had to any family…and I treated you like nothing more than an attack dog you get too attached to. I’ve wronged a lot of people when I was alive Jackie, some worse than others, and worst of all was you. You certainly weren’t an angel, but you had hell of a lot more potential to make something of yourself than me, and I fucked it up. Took a street kid off the streets and turned em into a cold blooded killer when I could’ve turned…no, raised you into a man this world would look at with respect and admiration instead of fear and disgust. I had the opportunity to make you a father to that little girl, and I used it to make you the very weapon responsible for tearing her from her mom. I deserved that bullet Jackie, deserved a lot more, after all I'm the one who taught you.” He said with a defeated smile, before slowly turning away from me and walking deeper into the woods. “Time to face your demons Jackie-boy, and best get moving quickly. The devil don’t like to be kept waiting.” He shouted back with a small wave to follow him forward. His words and tone filled me with such emotion it felt like I had almost blacked out again due to everything I had been told, and by the time I was able to truly process everything I was he said, Dante was well out of sight. I quickly followed the directions he had gone shouting for him to wait, but rather than coming across my old friend again…a door stood in his place, door 833 to be exact. \n\nI could only stare at it for what felt like hours. Debating what the hell could be behind this door, but it didn’t take long for me to realize I've already relived the worst of my past hands down. so whatever it was couldn’t even come close to the shit I've already gone through. I took one last look behind me, couldn’t tell you why exactly, maybe hoping to get one last push from Dante, but no, like he told me…it was my turn to deal with my demons, and I was gonna have to do it alone. So with one last deep breath I prepared for the worst, grabbed the doorknob, and stepped through. The moment I stepped through, I felt myself forcefully collapse to my knees as if all the emotions and stress built up throughout the ordeal gained physical weight to the point I couldn’t even turn my neck, only being able to stare down at what looked like marbled floor tiles, and listen to the sounds around me. Clinking glasses, multiple separate conversations, muffled sports broadcasts, all the telltale signs of a bar during rush hour. “So it really is you…” a woman’s voice spoke, successfully lifting my paralysis and allowing me to look up and see who had been speaking to me, only to see the very client who sent me through this all to begin with…and suddenly it all made sense, the moment as she removed her sunglasses, and my eyes locked onto to hers…a pair of emerald green eyes looking down on me.\n\nI didn’t need to ask who she was, I didn't really need to ask why she put me through what she did either. I wasn’t gonna plead for forgiveness, I knew I didn’t deserve it, especially not from her, and I wasn’t gonna attempt to spill my guts to her with my sorrow and guilt. The look in her eye told me she didn’t need to hear it. The only thing I could manage to get out was a confused and desperate “how?”. She didn’t answer, or more so couldn’t. She Just looked down at me as a vast array of emotions flashed across her face ranging from hate, to disgust, to pity. Instead, someone else came to answer for her, the waiter from where we first met. “Impressed? What can I say I am quite the artist am I not.” He said with charisma as I the man seemingly manifested from thin air, appearing right next to…my daughter. “Granted I’m not normally a family counselor but what can I say Jackie, your little girl's story really tugged at my heart strings.” He said in a mocking tone as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and squeezed it with great exaggeration. \n\nThe moment his hand made contact with her, something snapped inside of me, as I managed to break from my paralysis I lunged at the man, only to be pushed back to my knees by some unseen force with a single point of his finger. The man began to cackle like a drugged hyena. “So now you choose to be a dad? I hate to break it to you Pal, but you’re about 27 years late to the job.” He let out another laugh, the mockery in his voice only growing as he pointed his finger toward the ground and I was quickly forced down farther onto the floor. It felt as if a thousand pounds had been dropped on my back, slowly crushing me. “What the hell are you!?” I yelled out in pain and confusion as the pressure on my body grew. “Well I’m glad he asked, '' he said with a cheeky hint of pride in his voice as he did, and with a literal snap of his fingers, I suddenly found myself sitting in a diner booth, the strange man sitting just across from me. \n\nI frantically began to look around the empty diner before returning my attention to the mysterious man. “Where is she? What did you do to Jess?!” I half demanded, half pleaded. He scoffed in my face before answering. “Jess? That’s what she told you her name was? Not like you were ever around to learn her real one.” He said with a malicious grin before continuing. “Not to worry Jackson. Your daughter is safe and well. Like I said, me and her made a deal, and I am nothing if not a good salesman.” He said with confidence. His words lead me to ask him the same question as before he transported us to this diner. “And what exactly are you?” I asked slowly, fearing the answer I might get. His cheeky grin spread far wider than ever before, wider than what should be possible for a person. “Why I’m many things. In some worlds I’m god themselves, in others…well I’m the very thing that kills him, and burns the heavens out of the sky.” He said with a chill to his voice so cold and twisted I could feel it chilling my soul. “I am as human as the average man, and I’m as eldritch as the ancient ones.” He continued, and as he did his face began to morph. Taking the shape of famed historical figures, long extinct animals, and beings that can only be described as unnatural, before quickly returning to the face it took when we first met. “But to you, I’m no more than a debt collector.” He finished \n\nI could feel my heart race as my mind tried to comprehend what he was saying, along with the things I’ve just seen. It was clear whatever this thing was…It was far more powerful than it was letting on. I slowly steadied my breath, before finally asking another question. “A debt collector?” I said with more caution in my voice than ever. His grin somehow grew wider as he eagerly began to explain himself. “Precisely. You, in a sense, owed a debt to your daughter, pain. She wished for nothing more than for you to feel her pain, but not just that, to endlessly feel her pain. What you witnessed just a few moments ago was nothing more than a sample. Thanks to the deal her and I struck, once your life has officially ended you will be mine again.” He said, in a way so matter of fact I could tell this was far from the first time he’s told someone this. I was caught off guard by how casual he was, and didn’t even really take in what he said, but when I did I felt my heart stop for a moment. \n\n“And…and what was this deal?” I asked, trying my best to stay calm. It seemed this was the question he was waiting to answer, as the moment he heard it his eyes lit up like a kid on christmas. “A soul for a soul Jackie.” He said with that twisted grin only continuing to grow. When he did, the feeling of a running freight train blasted me in the gut as the room began spinning. I began to internally panic, which quickly broke out into external panic…and that’s when he sunk in the hook. “Of course, I am nothing if not a good businessman. Another deal can always be made.” He hinted with little subtlety. I didn’t hesitate, if I had an opportunity to protect her, and for once in my pathetic life, at least attempt to be a father to my daughter I had to take it. “Tell me, what do I have to do?!” I asked desperately. His response was to place my gun on the table between us with a sinister smirk. “Two souls in the distant future…Or one right now.” He said, tapping his fingers against the trigger. “I’m a busy person Jackie, and frankly I don’t have time to sit around and wait for some humans to kick the bucket.” \n\nI looked at him for what felt like hours, then down to my gun, then back to him. “So I give you my soul now, and you never come back for hers. That’s the deal?” I asked as a thousand thoughts ran through my head. He nodded, slowly sliding the gun closer towards me. “Simple as that, no strings attached.” He said. I took one more long look between him and my gun, before slowly picking it up. \n\nNow I’m writing this, my final words if you will. I'm not sure if these words will ever actually reach someone but the stranger has allowed me a few moments before I complete our deal, and with how few my options are, it seems this to be the most fitting way to spend my final moments of mortal life. I’m leaving this world a bad man. I know this one good action isn’t enough for redemption, but it’s the most good a bad man can hope to do. Forgiveness isn’t something I’m looking for, and I’m well aware of what awaits me on the other side. The best I can do is hope she’ll be okay, and that’s the cost of doing business in blood money.",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/11l6tzn)\n\nIt turns out that getting a therapist is hard. The Corporation had a few on hand but they mostly dealt with supernatural creatures or half-breeds. Only two knew how to relate to humans. But I didn’t connect with them. Nothing was wrong with that. Jackalope said it was best to find the right person instead of forcing getting better with the wrong one. \n\nIt would still take a little while after I did find the right person to figure out if I needed medication or not. The entire thing was exhausting, but I did need to do it. If I didn’t have Jackalope being so supportive, I would have already given up. Jackalope permitted me to do one job as long as two Agents stayed with me. It turns out that all of Six’s brothers were very protective of the one who befriended their family. I ended up finishing one job with two stern men wearing suits and sunglasses ready to attack any slight imaginary threat. \n\nI arrived home after a very long appointment. To my surprise, I saw Jackalope standing outside dressed in his suit. I hadn’t seen him wear it since he first moved in. His tie wasn’t fully done up. I went over to fix it for him before I questioned what was going on. \n\n“Who died?” I joked after I stepped away. \n\nHe forced a smile on his face. I didn’t like how he was acting, or what might be going on. I doubted he got hired back at The Corporation. He would have told me. This was something else. I very soon found out when a crack echoed down the road. I flinched at the noise, but Jackalope was expecting it. A large dark carriage came racing down the street. The two large horse-hybrid creatures made a sharp stop in front of the house. The back legs looked to belong to some sort of big cat. Each leg was scarred as if it had been stitched on. A deep scar ran across their necks, and it almost made it look as if someone attached the head of a white horse to a dark black body. \n\n“What’s going on?” I asked suddenly a bit scared of what just pulled up. \n\nJackalope didn’t give me an answer right away. The carriage door opened, and a large person stepped out. He was dressed in dark robes and at least two times my size. Grey tangled hair covered most of his face. But I saw his mouth lacking any lips grimacing in our direction. He gestured towards Jackalope to come over with one long gnarled finger. \n\n“A meeting with my family has been requested. They would like you to come along as well.” Jackalope answered. \n\nHe didn’t sound like himself. His voice was like how we first met. I didn’t like how he was forcing himself to appear calm. I looked between him and the monsters waiting for us. A feeling of fear started but I refused to let him go alone with such creatures. I gave the tall monster another look over wondering if somehow those two were related. \n\n“Alright. Let’s go.” I agreed and started to follow him to the waiting carriage. \n\nJackalope let his mask slip for a second. He wasn’t overly happy I was coming with him. The creature held the door open for us. He then made his way to the front of the carriage to drive it to the next location. I really hoped my neighbors didn’t see this. Normally supernatural creatures couldn’t be seen by humans unless they wanted to be. Or were too weak to make themselves invisible to their main food source.   \n\nThe door was closed, and it shut out the world outside. The seats weren’t too uncomfortable. A set of deep red curtains kept me from seeing where the carriage was headed. I felt it start moving but oddly enough didn’t hear the wheels or the horses outside. Jackalope sat across from me, not keen on starting up a conversation. \n\n“What is this all about?” I asked in a careful tone. \n\nHe wasn’t acting like himself. That stressed me out a little. \n\n“Do you know what a Jackalope is?” He asked. \n\nThe question made me pause. I’ve never really considered his name all that much. When I was much younger, I believed there were some horned rabbits somewhere in the desert like a lot of children. \n\n“A rabbit with horns I guess.” I replied to him. \n\nHe gave me a somewhat tired smile. His name meant a bit more than he let on before. \n\n“They’re a hoax. A taxidermy animal pretending to be real. Something almost believable you could assume was alive. Before I had a name my creator was torn between Jackalope or Fuji after the fake mermaid. But I don’t think I look like a Fuji.” He explained. \n\nAt least his hint of a smile looked real this time around. For a few moments, I didn’t understand what he was getting at. Then I remembered the scar down his front. The one that made it look like he’d been cut open at some point. My body grew cold at the realization. \n\n“You’re....” I started but wasn’t able to ask such a gruesome question. \n\nHis expression was one I didn’t like in the slightest. He smiled at my horror. Such a thing didn’t suit him. \n\n“My body was harvested from a deceased human. My organs are from a supernatural creature and my horns are from another creature. My name suits what I am. I was cut open, stuffed with something else, and a set of horns added to help with the hoax.” He admitted. \n\nNo wonder why Fera got so creeped out over the idea of him being created in such a way. I suppressed a shudder and needed to look away from him to collect myself.  \n\n“You have horns?” I asked trying to stay off the more gruesome topics of what he said. \n\nAnother real smile came. He nodded and followed my gaze to the set of curtains. Most monsters could hide certain features. I never saw his horns because he never used his powers around me. I’ve heard Jackalope wasn’t stable magic-wise. If his organs weren’t his own, it made sense he had issues using the power that came from them. \n\n“I remember a little bit of who I was before. Not much. It's very vague but... I know I had a family. People who cared about me. Their names are gone, but I know they were there. And I turned my back on them.” He said in a soft voice. \n\nHe's never talked about any of this before. The fact he was now wasn’t a very good sign. \n\n“What do you mean?” I asked a moment too late. \n\nI understood what he meant by turning his back on them. I had almost made the same mistake. I hated how that fact made me feel almost as much as I disliked his defeated expression. \n\n“I ended my own life when I was a human. I no longer remember the reasons. But I don’t believe it was justified if there were still people in my life supporting me. When I worked as an Agent, I always wore a fake smile. I’m a dead man. That was my choice. I shouldn’t be able to feel sadness or much of anything. The fact I have been enjoying myself recently is an insult to those I left behind.” \n\nWe sat and listened to the minor noises coming from outside. I wanted to reach out to him, but I knew he wouldn't accept any kind of comfort at that moment. He dealt with all of this on his own and I never had a clue. As his friend, I should have noticed how he felt. \n\n“Would you have hated me if I never made it home?” I asked him. \n\nI needed to fold my hands in front of myself to keep them from shaking. Jackalope looked up with a slightly horrified expression. He never would have been angry at me if I didn’t pull the gun away in time. He would blame himself before me for my actions. \n\n“Of course not.” He said truthfully. \n\n“Then why do you hate yourself for what you did? How come you can forgive everyone but yourself?” I pointed out. \n\nHe shook his head unable to respond. His answer was the same reason why I still blamed myself for his missing arm. No matter how much others said it wasn’t our fault, we simply couldn’t forgive ourselves for our actions. I didn’t realize that Jackalope had gone through so much the same things as myself. \n\nThe carriage slowed to a stop. We weren’t able to finish our conversation. The door opened and he walked out first. I stepped down to find we stopped in front of a massive Gothic mansion. The place was bleak and straight from an old black-and-white horror movie. I half expected a flash of lightning to appear in the grey sky. The carriage used some sort of magic to travel here. There wasn’t any way this place was in the same country as we started in. \n\nJackalope started forwards to the large wooden doors. I needed to half jog to keep up with his long strides. Another creature very similar to the one who picked us up stood by the doorway and watched us as we went inside. The main hallway looked dusty and old. Creatures peaked through the dark corners at us. All of them are a sown-together mess of other features. Jackalope may be the most human out of all of them. \n\nI followed him, the fear filling my limbs at the sight of the other creatures. He led us to a large room at the end of the main hallway. Instead of a tile floor, we stepped out into packed dirt. The room a large circle with an upper level. It looked a lot like a smaller version of a stage that Gladiators may have fought in. From the dark stains in the dirt, I fear this place was made for that kind of purpose. \n\nJackalope stood in the middle of the room and sat down on his knees. My legs would fall asleep with them tucked under like that, so I just sat in a different way that felt more comfortable. His head was directed to a small opening on the ground level. A chair was placed halfway out of the darkness. I saw a set of legs but didn’t see who was watching us. \n\n“It seems like my rabbit has finally come home. I never suspected you would show your face here after the disgrace of being fired. I suppose the Mailing Company is somewhat reasonable. I would have killed you if you didn’t get that job. Now, what would a failure like yourself request a meeting for?” \n\nThe voice sounded female. She acted like a harsh mother, so I assumed she had been the one to create Jackalope. She cut open his dead body, stuffed it with organs, and forced him to work a dangerous job. On principle, I didn’t like her. But I was shocked that Jackalope had been the one to request a meeting. It seems as if he kept his head down and working, his family wanted nothing to do with him. \n\n“I would like to request you to disown me.” He said in a stern voice. \n\nThe women in the chair were a bit of a way away, but we still heard each other just fine. I understood why he no longer wanted to be a part of this family, but why ask now? Why not when he was first fired? His parent asked that question for me. \n\n“Oh? Now for what reason do you wish to go off on your own?” She said in a teasing voice. \n\n“To get married.” Jackalope responded, his eyes still facing the other side of the room. \n\nMy brain shut down for a full minute. That didn’t make sense. I kept looking between him and his shrouded parent as if an answer would just appear. Married? To who? Was he dating someone from work and he just forgot to mention it? Or was it an Agent? Fera was out of the question because she liked other girls. I considered Nessie for a moment but that didn’t feel right in the slightest. As my thoughts ran a mile a minute, Jackalope lifted his hand. On reflex I took it. A slight tint of red came to his ears, but otherwise, his expression didn’t change. I finally clued in with such a loud click in my brain I thought those two heard it.  \n\nDid he want to marry me? \n\nWait. \n\nHold on. \n\nWe just lived together. It didn’t mean he actually liked me. I must be misreading this somehow. \n\nI didn’t have a chance to question him. A shrill mocking laugh came from the darkness. His unseen parent thought his request was hilarious. I flinched at the sound. My body wanted to get up and fight the one who dared laugh at such a genuine request. \n\n“Married? Someone like you? First, you bring disrespect to this family by being removed as an Agent, and now this? Not a single creature in our world cares for you. Being so desperate enough to request to be disowned for a human. I cannot stand it. I’ll do you a favor and have your other family members end your life here.” \n\nJackalope expecting this kind of answer. He shot to his feet pulling me up with him. We weren’t able to move from the spot. A creature dropped down from the second level. The lower half was a pure white snake, but the torso looked to belong to a human. The head, however, had been cut off and replaced with a huge crow face. Jackalope's parent created this monster with bits and pieces. The scars where the parts had been attached were visible on the body. I don’t think this monster wanted to attack us. It just didn’t have any choice. \n\nTwo more creatures dropped down on all fours. One was a dog the size of a horse with a human face. The other slightly smaller. The body looked similar to an otter. A dark black wolf's head attached low to the neck with a fresh scar. I stood defenseless and scared as hell. I didn’t have a weapon on me and Jackalope was missing an arm. We stood no chance against these monsters. \n\nOr so I thought. Because I’d been living with the kinder version of Jackalope, I’d almost forgotten he had been an Agent for a reason. His face held no hints of fear. A spark of black electricity came from his chest. In a fluid movement, he reached over to grab hold of it. The sparks turned into a long straight line as he pulled it away from his chest. The power formed into a sleek black blade. Instead of keeping it, he tossed it over to me. By some miracle, I caught the new sword without cutting my hand. The two monsters backed off when they saw the weapon. They knew something I didn’t. \n\nThe next movement came too fast for my eyes to catch. I only heard the loud crack of Jackalope moving. For half a second he had been standing next to me, then he was across the room. He’d slammed the snake creature into the stone wall so hard cracks appeared up to the ceiling. More jagged black shapes came from his body. When he turned, I could see just how much he changed. \n\nA set of black horns came from his head. They flickered as if they weren’t entirely solid. All the black energy around him crackled in an unstable way. His eyes landed on the other two creatures ready to take them down. \n\nI didn’t know the end goal of this fight. He wouldn’t kill the creatures that were forced to try to attack us. If we did escape, then we would be hunted down. I saw more eyes looking down at us and doubted Jackalope could defeat an army of these creatures. \n\nThe creature with the wolf head peeled off in my direction. I only had seconds to react. I swung down the sword a bit too early. A burst of dark sparks came from the blade directly into the creature pushing it back. Jackalope managed to also knock back the otter creature. Despite our progress, I doubted we would make it out alive. My hands shook in fear waiting for the monster to recover or for another one to come down to attack. \n\nMy fears were proven justified. Another snake-like creature dropped down hard near Jackalope. He didn't have enough time to get out of the way. The long tail caught his leg and slammed his body hard against the ground. I shouted out his name scared to death about him. I swung the sword again like a bat to send more power in that direction. It landed on the target pissing it off enough to let out a loud hiss and forget about Jackalope long enough for him to get up. \n\nHe stood on uneven feet. A cut on his forehead dropped blood down into the dirt. Something looked wrong. His horns were crackling. His face twisted in a feral expression and a set of dark claws appeared on his hand. More of that darkness started to cover his legs transforming them into something else. The otter creature tried to come up behind him. He slammed it with a powerful blow that embedded the poor things into the dirt. \n\nThe sword in my hand shook. The wolf's head came closer, and I used the sword once again. After the final blast of energy, the entire thing broke apart burning my hands and a spark flying up to cut the side of my cheek. Jackalope’s power was becoming unstable. He was an Agent and fought monsters for his entire life, but he didn’t have control over himself in the long run. If we didn’t get away now, we risked him attacking everyone including myself.  \n\nI saw him transforming into something else. His body hunched over as that black energy pouring from him crackled frantically. The sparks burst outwards hitting the stone walls and exploding pieces off them. I nearly got hit by one of those bursts. The wolf head creature made a run for it. The movement caught his eye. A somewhat focused amount of power was thrown in that direction knocking the creature aside. He nearly killed it with one attack. \n\nHe didn’t want this. I knew that. These creatures were the same as him. But their bodies were weaker and that made their power more stable than his own. The sound of the magic around us and the room slowly being destroyed was overpowering. But I still tried to reach him.  \n\n“Jackie!” I shouted over all the noise. \n\nA hint of recognition came to his eyes. A new monster jumped down into the fray almost directly on top of me. I covered my head with my arms expecting to die in the next few seconds. Instead, I felt an arm wrap around my waist and a burst of wind hit my back. When I opened my eyes, I saw all the remaining creatures knocked out. Jackalope stood next to me, and his entire demeanor changed. His horns no longer flickered, and that black energy flowed around him instead of crackling. Somehow, he’d been able to stabilize his powers.  \n\nTo my shock, he leaned down to bring us closer. His head resting next to my own. \n\n“Please keep helping me.” He whispered causing my face to grow hot. \n\n“I haven’t done anything. I’m just here.” I admitted. \n\n“Sometimes that’s all I need.” \n\nHe pulled back to show off his smile. Scarred face or not, his smile was perfect. Unable to help myself, I held him back a bit convinced we might make it out here alive.  \n\n“How disgusting!” \n\nI’d forgotten about his parent for a few minutes. The person he feared the most finally came out from the darkness. The human body we saw was nothing but a lie. A monster poured from the shadows. The body long with countless arms grafted on. The main head looked like a beautiful woman. Around it was a circle of other heads of creatures. All of them with dead milky eyes. This monster not only created stitched-together creatures, but it added other parts onto itself to gain power. \n\n“You have no rights to this power! You were made to serve and nothing else! What an insult! What a disgrace! Those organs do not belong to you, nothing in your body does! I worked hard to find them and you owe everything to me! How dare you use it for your own gain, I shall put an end to this right now!” The monster screeched. \n\nI knew this thing was stronger than both of us. I didn’t want to die for once. Not know. But I didn’t have any clue how we would be able to get out of this. There was no time to think. A light came from the creature’s main mouth. Jackalope matched it with his power. They both attacked at the same time knowing that energy exploding after hitting each other would cause a backlash that would kill someone here.  \n\nAt the last second a crack of pure silver lightning came down between two blasts. A shockwave hit us all. I would have been blown off my feet if Jackalope hadn’t kept an arm around my side to support me. When the dust settled a new person stood between us. I stared at someone I never would have expected. \n\n“Would you care to repeat what you just said?” The newcomer said in an intimidating tone. \n\nHe was the white-haired man that took over the Hunters' case and the person I’d spoken with before. I dismissed him as being The Silver King when we met before. He acted to kind but now his entire personality shifted. His red eyes hard enough to make the creature back down. \n\n“This boy of mine...” It started in a weak voice. \n\n“From what I’ve seen, Jackalope has well paid back his debt for his life. He’s worked an honorable job, and if he wishes to be removed from this family, I do not see why not. His body is his own. You did do a proper trade for the pieces that make him up, correct? Therefore, he does not owe anything. However, thirty-five years ago there was a rash of stolen organs. If somehow, he ended up with one or two, then surely, he would owe himself to the family affected by that death. If that isn’t the case, then he should be free to go.” The man spoke and his worded implied a lot. \n\nIf the creature refused, it would have been admitted it stole the parts to make Jackalope, if not all the creatures in this family. That would mean Jackalope risked having his organs returned to the other creature’s family. And his parent would be arrested or killed for the crimes. But if the creature claimed to have gotten the parts in a fair way, then Jackalope could go free. He's worked enough to no longer owe his parent for his life. \n\nI saw the internal struggle on this creature's face. If it let Jackalope go, then the other creatures it made could follow in his footsteps. But if it didn’t it risked being killed by The Silver King on the spot. \n\n“Yes. You’re right. Jackalope has earned his freedom. He had worked enough for me to get back the worth of his traded organs. We were just... testing him to ensure he was strong enough to leave this family.” The creature lied. \n\n“Then there is no issue. I wish to speak with him alone for a short while. There are special protocols when a creature becomes engaged with a human. It’s best if we go over them.” The King spoke and turned towards us. \n\nThe creature’s Jackalope fought were stirring. At least they would recover from the fight. We followed behind the white-haired man, and I gave one last look over my shoulder to that towering monster. Clear hatred showed on its attractive face. If anyone but The Silver King spoke to them, they might have just killed everyone in the room. \n\nWe didn’t leave the mansion. Instead, we ended up in a room off to the side. Cautious, the King finally broke his composure. \n\n“Look at how dirty you two are! You must have been so scared!” He said in a voice completely different than how he spoke to the monster. \n\nJackalope’s horns faded, and he did look pretty rough from the fight. Cautious frantically brushed us both off. Form some reason, our minor wounds healed along with the dirt being brushed aside.  \n\n“Did you just...” I asked slowly as I looked at my newly healed hand.  \n\n“I just helped you with the dirt. That’s all.” Cautious said as a huge hint to drop it. \n\nAt least I was smart enough to do so. I don’t think he could display any kind of favoritism and heal others for no reason. \n\n“Thank you. I wasn’t expecting you to come in person. I thought you to be too busy, but you did save us.” Jackalope said over to the man. \n\nCautious smiled in a way that made him look much younger. Now everything made sense. Jackalope turned to me to start explaining what I already knew.  \n\n“My parent...” He started but wasn’t able to get the words out. \n\n“I get it. Your parent killed and stole parts of other creatures to make all of you. Since being an Agent is a respectful job, they must have seen this as an easy way to create a powerful family with a shortcut. I’ve been working on scenes with stolen organs. So, they just have started back up recently. When you heard what jobs I’ve been doing, you arranged all this to put an end to it.” I commented. \n\nBoth of them looked at me as if they didn’t expect a human to put easy hints together. At least that was explained, but we still had a very important thing to talk about. \n\n“About... the marriage thing.” Jackalope stared, his voice clearly embarrassed. “I... I needed to say something that would upset my parent enough to make them attack. I’m sorry. I risked your life for something like this.” \n\nCautious looked between us interested but not wanting to interrupt. \n\n“Did... You do not mean the offer?” I asked slowly. \n\nJackalope let out a nervous smile, refusing to look in my direction. It looked almost sad in a way. \n\n“Well, most people need to be in love with each other to get married.” He pointed out.  \n\n“Good. We got that covered.” I replied without any hesitation. \n\nIt took a few minutes for either of them to react. Jackalope kept trying to say something, but words failed him. My chest got tight, and I knew my expression looked as stunned as he did. \n\n“I need to step into the other room to scream for a few minutes.” He finally admitted.  \n\n“Take your time. I’ll be here.” \n\nWe defaulted to sounding like business partners in order not to break down. He left so quickly that I thought I saw his heels kick up dust. The moment he was out of the room Cautious came over to me to take my arm. He shook me, frustrated over what he just saw. \n\n“Why didn’t you confess to him in a better way!” He demanded sounding like a child.  \n\n“I panicked.” I said truthfully. \n\nI was still in shock and the full truth of what just happened hadn’t hit just yet. Cautious was saying something but my brain refused to listen. I thought I heard him say that we needed a ring for this to be proper. Then disappeared through a door leaving me alone with my thoughts. Which were just internal screaming. \n\nCautious came back before Jackalope. He placed something in my hand, and it made me crack a smile. I didn’t have time to make fun of him for it. Jackalope came back into the room flustered. He had hoped we would have forgotten the whole thing in the few minutes he’d been gone for. I walked over to him and offered what The Silver King brought.  \n\n“Cautious said we needed a ring.” I told him. \n\nJackalope looked it over wondering if this was a joke. \n\n“This is a ring pop.” He pointed out the obvious.  \n\n“I panicked!” Cautious admitted. \n\nJackalope laughed and I think it was the first time I heard him do so. I felt a little bit jealous that Cautious was the one who caused it. It felt weird having an audience for this conversation. Soon we didn’t need to worry about it. A door flew open, and a large person walked swiftly over to the most important person in the room. Cautious tried to get away, but he was easily lifted over the shoulder of the newcomer. He wore a long trench coat that went down to his ankles. His face was just a tangled mess of vines with two eyes barely visible. \n\n“I’m taking this.” The newcomer stated. \n\nHe turned to carry away the struggling King. Cautious yelling back to us to call him for updates. With that strange scene over with, I needed to force on a more important conversation. \n\nI realized I was fairly close to Jackalope, which was embarrassing. But I didn’t move back. \n\n“We really should get a proper ring. Before that, we should try dating first.” I offered already feeling a blush creep up my neck. \n\nI felt him take a hold of my hand which didn’t make it easier to deal with this whole ordeal. \n\n“I don’t what you to go through this if you think you owe me in some way. I can’t imagine how hard it’ll be for you if we do make it official. I'm not human, and a guy. Some people tend to frown on both of those aspects. And... I’m...” He trailed off to look at the room we were standing in. \n\nHe'd been made from stolen parts. He carried the weight of three lives. The one for his horns. Another for what was inside, and the final was the man who died for him to become what he is now. I wondered if he offered his life for my own that day because he just was tired and wanted an easy way out. Or he might have had no reason at all for such an impulse. \n\n“You're perfect.” Another thing embarrassing to say, but he needed to hear it. \n\nHis smile came back for a few seconds. Then tears started in his eyes. For his entire life, he never considered just living to be a possibility. Working as an Agent meant he could have died at any time. Now he could take it easy in a perfectly normal house, doing reasonable work. The fact that someone would stay beside him after knowing everything about his past had been beyond something he ever hoped for. \n\nI let him bury his face into my shoulder. I carefully held him back as I thought why the hell this took so long. I’ve never really dated anyone. With my self-esteem issues, I didn’t think a person could ever see me as an equal. I never even considered gender when it came to a partner. After everything, this felt right. \n\nWhen he pulled away, his face was stained with tears he rubbed away with the back of his hand. This was the second time I’d made him cry. I felt a little guilty about that. I wanted to make it up to him. When I leaned in closer to do so, he pulled back. That simple action caused me to spiral into thinking somehow, I completely mistook everything we said so far. \n\n“My face is a mess.” Jackalope explained which ended my spiral. \n\nI showed him just how little I cared about a still-damp face from tears. For a few minutes... \n\nI felt eyes on us and nearly died when I realized we weren’t exactly in a private place to be showing any kind of affection. He agreed that we should head home before his parent found us and did something none of us liked. \n\nThe carriage waited outside to take us back. The Driver looked somewhat friendlier even though his lip-less expression never changed. The entire ride back was awkward. We weren’t certain how to react to each other after everything that happened. \n\nSure, we nearly died but that barely touched the mortifying ordeal of asking out your previous roommate. We acted like blushing schoolgirls for the rest of the day. It may have been easier to deal with if we didn’t live with each other. \n\nJust as I thought I would be able to calm down a little I was tricked. Jackalope wanted me to stay in his room for the night and promised nothing would happen. After the day he went through, I agreed.  \n\nIt was impossible to close my eyes let alone try to sleep with him next to me. I stared up at the ceiling with the glow of the small rabbit light casting shadows in the room. His bed was far too soft with all the blankets but very warm. \n\n“Do you wanna make out?” He asked as a joke to break some tension.  \n\nI gave his shoulder a light tap. \n\n“Yes, but I’m not ready for that.” I answered honestly. \n\nI didn’t know how much time that might take. I dreaded I might just shut down and he would leave me for someone else if I didn’t get my act together. I looked over at him. His face clear due to the small light next to the bed. \n\n“I don’t think I’m good enough for all of this. I don’t like myself.” I admitted getting serious because I thought he needed to hear the truth. \n\n“I can’t see why you don’t see all your good qualities.” He answered back. \n\n“Lying at the start of this relationship?” I said in a falsely offended voice.  \n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He said matching my tone. \n\n“Gaslighting now too? I should have seen all these reflags before we got engaged.” \n\nHe wanted to keep the joke going but the word engaged made his face twist back into a shy smile. He wanted to scream but held it in. \n\n“I am serious about how I feel. But... I like who I am with you. All this right now is alright. I feel guilty for putting it all on you. I don’t want you to think you have to stay here. You can leave if I become too much of a burden.” \n\nAll of that was also true. He wasn’t going to be responsible for my mental state. I would never hold him down to make myself feel better. But I never considered he also needed me. A regular human might not see him in the same way I did, and if a creature found out how he had been made they would be disgusted by it. \n\n“I like who we turned into.” He said back. \n\nWe. It had always been simple answers with him. \n\nHe wanted to save my life because I gave his existence a second thought. \n\nI wanted to keep living to put up his hair every morning. \n\nIt had been we since he moved in. I wasn’t the only one being supported by him. He needed me around no matter how much I refused to see it. I knew if I spoke again, I would start crying. Instead, we both stayed next to each other watching the shadows on the ceiling for a few minutes. \n\n“Wanna fool around?” He half-joked. \n\nHe could be pretty demanding when he wanted to be. But that was alright. Sometimes you should give in to a demanding partner from time to time. \n\nIt took a long time to get my home life settled. I needed to figure out my work life. Doing jobs in the field was almost out of the question. I came back with bullet holes too many times. Now I have a home to return to. I asked for a meeting with Lupa to go over some sort of arrangement. He agreed two days after the technical engagement. That was a fact I wasn’t sure how to approach. \n\nFera picked me up to bring me into the office. She could make a magic connecting door, but also a friendly face was always needed. Her beads were a bright orange that day. All the bright colors really suited her. She greeted Jackalope who came over to the front door to see us off. \n\n“How is the shoulder doing? Robin said to stop doing dangerous jobs and no one wants to see you in the clinic for a third bullet wound.” She commented. The snitch. \n\n“Third time? When was the second time?” Jackalope said as if this was a murder investigation. \n\n“I don’t want to talk about the second time.” I replied as if I was on trial. \n\nAt least he was letting it drop until I got back home. \n\n“You really need to tell your roommate important things!” She scolded.  \n\n“Fiancé.” I corrected. \n\nThe word took a while to sink in. When it did, she let out a screech and latched herself onto me. I nearly fell over the sudden weight. I heard a lot of ‘I told you so’ for the next few minutes. Jackalope peeled her off so we could get my meeting done with. Fera wanted to tell Nessie right away, but we already accidentally broke the news over text and told her he was going to be our flower girl replacement. \n\nShe needed to get her shrieking under control. The moment we stepped through the door and into the office, she snapped back to a professional Agent. She led me to Lupa’s office, this time I was a bit more confident dealing with the meeting. \n\nI walked through the small path to find the set of couches in the middle of the plants. Lupa sat with papers again. This time he didn’t set them down when I sat. \n\n“I would like to stop doing fieldwork.” I told him. \n\n“Yes, that would be best. You appear to be somewhat of a liability. There may be jobs when we do have proper Agents to protect a human like yourself. We can offer those to you when they come up.” He said sounding almost bored. \n\nI wasn’t expecting this to be so easy. They needed my skills in some way. So why let me only do a job from time to time? Lupa kept speaking to answer my unspoken question.  \n\n“We would like to offer you a teaching job instead. The Agents get along well with you. It would be a better arrangement.” \n\nI sat stunned. I never even considered that kind of work before. That would be perfect for me. But I had another question. \n\n“Why didn’t you offer this to me before? I was shot. Twice.” I huffed.  \n\nHe finally set down his work. A smile came on his face as if he had won some sort of game. \n\n“Do you think you had the confidence to do so when you first started working for us?” He asked. \n\nI was about to say yes, but the truth sank in. I would have rejected just a teaching job to start with. I would not have believed anyone should have listened to what I had to say. While on the field I did teach some Agents, but I also did another job at the same time. It made me feel busy or as if I was doing something useful. Lupa saw through me. He might have known more about who I was than myself from the start. I hated how easily I got played. \n\n“I do understand why Jackalope doesn’t like you.” I said as a cheap shot. \n\n“I am not wrong in my assessments. I make the choices most cannot. I wonder why you could forgive the Hunter and yet you do not like my reasoning.” He answered back in an easy tone. \n\nHe brought up a good point. I’ve nearly died twice because of him. He was the one who ordered Jackalope to suggest I spread the word about the Dark God. They did not have Agents strong enough to stop the deaths. Lupa was willing to sacrifice lives to put an end to the deaths at some point. When he assigned that job with The Whisper he knew if I died then it would confirm something supernatural was at work. If they brought on strong Agents, they would not have found the creature before it killed again. \n\nThe Hunter shot me and yet I forgave him. I saw some creatures as equal to humans and that man killed them. Lupa made calculated choices and The Hunter acted on emotion. But they both had blood on their hands.   \n\n“I forgave him because he cares.” I told him. \n\nLupa gave me a questioning look but didn’t appear offended. He shuffled the papers in his hands somehow making the action threatening. \n\n“A bold statement to claim I do not care about the lives of my Agents. I want the best for them. And I must keep working. If we are all caught up its best if you head home to your new roommate.” Lupa dismissed me. \n\n“Fiancé.” I corrected on reflex. \n\nHe didn’t seem to care either way. Jackalope wasn’t working for him and therefore meant nothing in his eyes. I started to head back through the path wanting to get home. I glanced over at the small creature. I’d met a lot of kindhearted creatures and it nearly made me forget there were real monsters out there. I was glad that Jackalope got away when he did. I feared what would have happened to him if he stayed under Lupa’s control for much longer. \n\nAs I walked back through my front door and kicked off my shoes, I found it hard to believe all of this started with some strange deaths. I saw them through to stare directly into the dark. I became scarred from everything that happened and nearly lost my life more than once. Somehow, I got through the other side alive and doing better than before. There would still be bad days. For once I finally thought there would be more of the better days than the hard ones. I still had work to do. A lot more than I might even know. But I knew one important and simple fact. \n\nWe’re still here and that’s all that matters.",

        "text": " \n\nMy best friend Alan and I were best friends ever since secondary. We always would play games and mess around, you know what any other teenager would do. Everything was going great and we were inseparable. We formed a bond that could be compared to a mother's bond with her child. Everything went downhill ever since the accident, Alan and I were on our way back from a party that we were invited to, and I had a little too many shots and got drunk, Alan didn’t have as many so he insisted that he would drive but me being drunk and just fucking ignorant didn’t let him drive. We made our way to the car and when we were halfway home a Van had hit us. It hit the seat that Alan was on and instantly killed him.\n\nEvery day I blame myself for his death. I was expelled from school and got kicked out of my parent’s house. I had no money and was forced to get a job and live with my dad. I moved out of my dad’s and got my own apartment but a few weeks later I kept hearing shouting from outside of my window. I lived on the 5th floor of the apartment building so I had no idea how anybody could shout so loud without waking anybody else up, I ignored it thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me since I had so much going on. It kept happening and I kept getting woken up from my sleep, when I looked out there was nobody, maybe it was just some 13 or 15-year-old playing around or some other shit. This kept happening for the next 2 weeks when I finally had enough. I looked outside and I finally saw it. It was disgusting, I couldn’t describe what I saw other than just a lanky creature just standing there staring at me. The worst thing had to be the fact that it had Alan’s face and was trying to imitate him and tried to get me to leave my apartment. I finally had enough and decided to leave my room, since I had nothing left. No friends, no family and no love. When I left my room I heard something screeching across the corridor.\n\nWhen I finally saw it run across the corridor I was greeted by a disgusting monster with skin as dark as charcoal and limbs approximately 1.5 metres in length. I embraced it. As this alien-like monster charged through the corridor, I was relieved that after all these years of trauma, I was now going to leave this hell of a world and join my best friend. When all of a sudden someone pushed me back into my room and forced it to lock, I was extremely confused as to who it was. When I managed to look out the peephole in my door I saw it was my neighbour, he stopped the door from opening. I tried my best to save him but the screeches kept getting louder, I realised that I couldn’t do anything. I looked out the peephole one last time but didn’t see him. All I saw was Alan’s face looking directly back at me, his face distorted, his smile smeared across his face from one eye socket to another and his eyes were missing. Oh Lord what the fuck did I do, why won’t you let me die? The creature left just as fast as it came, all it left was just a trail of blood.",

For the three of us, however, peace meant always looking over our shoulders, wondering what price we would pay and when it would be demanded of us.\n\nOften, I found my thoughts drifting back to my great-grandparents, to John and Ellen. What was this place, really? Was it just a dumping ground for those the witch wanted to punish? Some sort of demented zoo with my family as the reluctant keepers? Could this place ever be normal, a place of happiness once more?\n\nAnd even if we could proceed to each cottage and one by one eliminate each entity, what then? When would the hammer fall? Surely, the witch had some retribution planned, even if it appeared that for now she allowed me to mess with her playthings.  \n\nHow do you prepare to face a…being like that? Waiting was the only thing that made sense to me. Biding my time until I thought of a solution. Or until my time ran out.\n\nI read Martina’s notebook every day, hoping that the next time I’d open it, it would magically be filled with answers. I’d sit with a tumbler of whiskey and willed things to be different. While I sat ruminating, René, with the help of an apologetic Jake, had begun the repairs to my front porch. I’m not asking where they got their materials—they showed up a couple nights ago with the exact amount in tow. They were nearly finished already and I began to understand why my great-grandparents had found supernatural labor so valuable.\n\nIn fact, I understand a lot more about my great-grandparents now. It all started when I was searching for my uncle’s Irish crystal whiskey glasses for my nightly tipple. They weren’t particularly valuable, but they were pretty and I thought it would be nice to use them. I recalled seeing them in a small box in the drawers underneath the bookshelf. As I pushed aside old beer koozies and golf tees, my hand hit a smooth, slim leatherbound album.\n\nI opened it. It was my great-grandparents’ wedding photograph from 1921, Ellen with a magnificent lace veil pooling at the ground, secured with a circlet of flowers across her brow in the fashion of the time, John standing beside her in a three-piece suit, the hint of a smile on both their lips, eyes joyous. The next photo was of Ellen sitting on a blanket in front of a familiar looking dock. Then of John posing with a Model T. Ellen and John together in a boat. Numerous, casual, playful pictures of people I hadn’t known.\n\n“He loved that Kodak camera.”\n\nI looked up to find René at my shoulder, smiling wistfully.\n\n“What happened, René? What happened to this place?”\n\nHe nodded sadly.\n\n“It’s time, isn’t it?”\n\n“Yes. It’s time.”\n\nHe sat beside me and began to speak.\n\n“For fifty years, I had wandered after being released from the service of the witch, haunting the campfires of the St. Lawrence, looking for the blood of evil ones, or perhaps someone in need of some carpentry.” He laughed dryly.\n\n“I did not mind that my existence was far more menial than it had been with *her.* I relished the freedom, for the first time in nearly two centuries, I could go where I pleased. The nights were mine.\n\nI was walking along the river on one such night in May of 1923 when I came across a group of men, arguing in low, but stern voices, barely above a whisper, but obviously audible for a creature such as me. The evening was pitch black, a night of the new moon, perfectly capable of hiding certain types of activity from prying eyes. I crouched down behind a copse of trees. One man stood on a dock, and two sat in a small boat laden with what appeared to be crates of vegetables. All three wore flat caps pulled low, obscuring their features.\n\nI hadn’t fed in awhile and the prospect of coming across not one, but multiple potential ne’er do wells was almost too exciting. I listened to the conversation intently. There was a disagreement between the man on the dock and the men in the boat.\n\n‘That price is insultingly low, John,’ said one of the boat men.\n\n‘I’m sorry.  I can’t budge.’\n\n‘After all the nice business we’ve done together…’\n\n‘My friends were pretty upset with the condition of the goods last time. Corks were wet, juice was undrinkable.’\n\n‘We’re out here risking our necks for your “friends” and the best you can do is some lowball offer? We would have gone with Simpson’s crew if we knew you were going to be so stingy.’\n\n‘You’ve gotten careless, Doyle. Maybe if you had put some of the money into fixing that leaky boat of yours instead of with your bookie, we wouldn’t be in this unfortunate situation.’\n\nI could sense a wave of rancor rise in the men of the boat. One of them was armed. I knew that the man at the dock would not leave there alive, and that gunshots would spoil my chance at a decent meal. Sure enough, the man called Doyle drew a gun on the man at the dock. The man called John took a step back and raised his hands, but his face was resolute. No one paid attention as I crept silently down towards the river. I assessed the distance between me and Doyle. \n\nWith a leap I pushed John to the ground and pounced on Doyle in the boat. Before he could react, I was ripping into his neck and drinking, until all too quickly he dropped to the ground. His accomplice was screaming. He tried to jump out of the boat, but John cut the rope mooring and fled into the night, leaving us out to drift. I grabbed the other boat man’s collar, bit into his artery and he met the same fate as his companion.\n\nI cleared the bodies of any valuable items and shot the corpses with the gun. After some time in the river, the authorities would assume the deaths were “ordinary” homicides. Underneath the vegetables were a couple crates of fine champagne. I decided to let those bottles drift with the boat, treasure for a lucky scavenger to find. \n\nI did not enjoy the swim to the shore, but even though I was soaked, I felt wonderful with the infusion of fresh blood. Between the blood and the cash, I figured I was in good shape for quite some time. I was so exuberant that I completely forgot about the third man, John. He was lying in wait for me with his knife. He plunged it into my side before I could throw him off of me and with a groan, I saw a good deal of that hard earned blood pour out before the wound healed.  John’s every instinct told him to run away, but he stood transfixed at the monster before him, shaking.\n\n‘I saved your life and this is how you repay me,’ I chuckled. I locked eyes with him. ‘Be calm, John,’ I instructed. He took a deep breath and put his knife away.\n\n‘What are you?’ He asked.\n\n‘A vampire,’ I said. \n\nWhy mince words? He had seen me in action, after all. I could see that this troubled him, of course. Nevertheless, he shocked me by extending his hand. \n\n‘Vampire or no, I suppose I’m in your debt.’\n\nI took it and though I saw a sliver of fear pass through his eyes at the coldness of my touch, we shook.\n\n‘John Calnon.’\n\n‘René Allaire.’\n\n‘I’d say it’s a pleasure, but I’m not sure that’s the right word.’\n\nI laughed.\n\n‘Likewise,’ I said, pointing to the bloodied hole in my shirt where he had wounded me.\n\n‘Ah, well, sorry about that. I suppose if you were going to kill me you would have done so already.’\n\n‘That is correct.’\n\n‘So then, Mr. Allaire, I’m at your service. I’d offer you the champagne those assholes were bringing me, but I doubt you’d have much use for it.’\n\n‘No, that’s quite alright. I only ask for a place to stay during the day. Somewhere the sunlight can’t penetrate.’\n\n‘I have cellar. With a sturdy metal door and lock.’\n\n‘That would do nicely. Thank you.’\n\n‘As I said, I’m in your debt.’\n\nI followed him up a rocky hill to a humble white clapboard house. Before he could open the doors to the cellar, a woman ran out, a look of concern on her face.\n\n‘John!’ she cried, embracing him. ‘I heard gunshots!’\n\n‘I’m fine,’ he muttered. She pulled away and examined him, then looked at me, her eyes immediately drawn to the blood on my shirt and face, and the fact that I was still quite wet. She turned to John, waiting for an introduction or explanation.\n\n‘Ellen,’ he began, voice unsure. ‘This is René Allaire.  Mr. Allaire, this is my wife, Ellen. Ellen, this man just saved my life. Doyle and Miller drew a gun and, well…” He trailed off.\n\n‘I took care of them,’ I added. Ellen narrowed her eyes.\n\n‘What do you mean?’ she said suspiciously. \n\nI glanced at John who seemed frozen with indecision. My usual practice was secrecy, of course. But I had already revealed myself to John. Ellen had just as much a right to know. I opened my mouth, revealing my fangs. Her eyes widened, and the color drained out of her face. \n\n‘You said your name was Allaire?’ she asked.\n\n‘Yes. I was from French Canada.’\n\n‘As were my parents,’ she said. ‘My grandmother would tell me stories about creatures like you. The blood drinker.’\n\n‘That is what I am. Your husband has kindly offered me your cellar for my rest, but I understand if you do not want me under your roof.’\n\nEllen and John exchanged glances. Ellen nodded.\n\n‘If you saved John’s life, then his debt is mine as well. Would you care to warm yourself by our fire? I can give you some of John’s old clothes.’\n\nThis act of kindness may sound trivial to you, but you have to understand, it was the most I had received in over two centuries. I agreed to her offer, genuinely moved.\n\nAs we walked up the wooden stairs to their home, one buckled under me. John and Ellen were apologetic.\n\n‘I can fix it,’ I said. ‘I’m a carpenter.’\n\nEllen’s face lit up with excitement, but John did not share her enthusiasm. Within moments, we were seated by the fire, my wet and dirty clothes replaced. Ellen handed me a rolled-up piece of paper, spreading it out before me. It was a blueprint for a series of cottages scattered around the land adjacent to the Calnons’ home. \n\n‘We have some money now,’ John began hesitantly. ‘I’ve always worked as a handy man—jack of all trades, really—for a bunch of the rich folks who have their summer homes around here. Been doing that since I was a kid. Since Prohibition, those rich folks have been antsy. Can’t get the booze they’re accustomed to anymore. That’s where I come in. I go between them and the smugglers. Works well for everyone. Rich people don’t get their hands dirty and I get my cut. It's been very good money for us.’\n\n‘But if we could build these cottages, we wouldn’t need that sort of money any more,’ Ellen interjected eagerly. ‘As you saw today, it’s dangerous. Too dangerous. You see, we’ll be having a baby in November.’\n\n‘I understand. If you let me stay here and provide the materials, I’ll build whatever you like.’\n\nAnd so, we agreed. It was a fine summer, full of warmth and true companionship. John found me a proper house to live in, owned by his cousin, but often I would find myself staying in the Calnons’ cellar after long nights of work. I embellished Ellen’s design with a few of my own touches and by the time the first cold breezes announced the arrival of autumn, the cottages were nearly completed.\n\nThat’s when the trouble began. \n\nOne night, I was finishing up some final tasks. I was returning to the cellar when I passed by one of the recently completed cottages. There was a dull, yet distinctive scratching sound, accompanied by a low humming that felt as though it were coming from under my skin. I put my ear to the cottage’s door and the sound only became louder. I opened the door and out poured a horde of cockroaches. The entire floor was covered with them, a veritable writhing carpet. They crawled out of the door, over my boots and into the dark, leaving exposed on the cottage floor the bones of a cat, picked clean.\n\nI lowered myself to the floor, my head in my hands, stifling a cry of despair and disbelief. I knew that she had found me. For a half of a century, she had left me in peace. No macabre little gifts, no black apparitions in the dead of night, no malevolent laughter. I had truly believed that I was free. How foolish I was, over two hundred years old and still the naïve youth. \n\nI decided to not worry Ellen and John, especially given Ellen’s delicate condition. I figured that I could run away, leave them to their lives. The thought of leaving without saying goodbye to the people who had been so kind to me was almost unbearable, but I knew I had to do it. \n\nI was too late.\n\nNo sooner had I made the decision to leave when the sky began to churn that familiar, nauseating green. Ellen and John stepped outside in their bedclothes holding each other in fear.\n\n“There’s someone…laughing in the house,” John said bewildered, eyes wide with terror.\n\n“You both need to listen to me. Leave *now*. Go to your church, wake up the priest, do whatever you need to do, but stay in the sanctuary until sunrise. Do you understand?”\n\nThey nodded. John disappeared inside the house and returned with a woolen blanket, which he wrapped around Ellen, and his gun. They ran down the hill to their Model T, but before they could escape inside, the car burst into flames. They screamed.\n\nI felt a burning hand on my arm, cold lips at my ear. My stomach churned.\n\n“You are mine. Forever.”\n\nHer voice was death. I did not turn around.\n\n“Take me then. Leave them be.”\n\nShe walked in front of me, her hand caressing my cheek as she passed. She gazed with disdain at the Calnons cowering before her.\n\n“Pathetic, René. You truly are pathetic. I give you the world and this is where I find you?”\n\n“What is he to you?” she said to John and Ellen. “Did you think a creature such as he could be your pet?”\n\n“He is our friend,” said Ellen resolutely. She stood straight and wiped the fear from her face.\n\nThe witch’s mouth peeled into a wide, black grin. John aimed his gun at her with trembling hands, which, of course, made her smile even wider.\n\n“Arrogance. The vice of all men.” With a twist of her hand, she forced them to kneel before her in the ground. She bent down and placed a hand on Ellen’s belly. Ellen shrieked with heartrending agony. “I haven’t held a baby in so long.  Shall I take him? Shall I carve it out of her right now?”\n\n“Enough!” I shouted. “Let’s make a deal. Do what you want to me, take me, kill me, I don’t care. But leave them and their child alone.”\n\n“You do not know what you ask. You still think the worst thing is death,” she laughed.\n\n“Do we have a deal?”\n\n“Yes. It is done.” A short dagger materialized in her hand. She began to kiss me, and for the sake of the Calnons, I dared not flinch or turn away. She drove the dagger into my gut, my chest, over and over until I staggered and collapsed. She straddled my body and with one swift movement cut my throat. Blood poured out of my many wounds; my body not quick enough to heal them. I was weak, so weak I could barely lift my head. \n\n“These mortals I will spare, but this place…” she gestured to the cottages around her. “I quite like it. I have friends of mine, humble servants, who need a home. And as you two seem so fond of monsters,” she said kicking me, causing even more blood to spill out of my mouth, “you will find no trouble extending to them the same hospitality. They require a certain amount of…upkeep. But you will learn and obey the rules.”\n\nShe turned towards me, bleeding out before her. \n\n“And as for you, my traitorous lover. I see you delight in your craftsmanship. Did you like playing at the simple carpenter, once more? Perhaps you’d like to stay here forever.”\n\nI felt my body lifted, suspended in air. I was walking into a dark place, though I knew I could not move. The sound of wood, hammers, coming as though from a distance. The air was hot and close. Taxing all my strength, I lifted my hand and immediately touched a wall. I was trapped, entombed.\n\nShe was right, there are worse things than death. But those first years, in which my consciousness and thirst nearly drove me mad, the worst was knowing that it was my fault, my hubris that brought the witch to torment your family, though only now do I understand what she has done here.”\n\n“And what was that?” I asked, hugging the album of John and Ellen close, as though I could reach back in time and protect them from what was coming.\n\n“Payments, taxes, your grandfather was wise to conceive of them as debts. For even a creature such as she has such obligations. The entities that she has bound to the cottages, burdening your family with their maintenance—that is but mere amusement to her. But then there is the grand tax, the one above all, the one that even *she* must pay on the quarter days. To keep with our corporate metaphors, she has outsourced even that grave duty to the caretakers of this place. John and Ellen, your grandfather, your uncle, Martina, and now you, you became her unwitting agents.”\n\n“How do we break it? How do we default, so to speak?”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“That I do not know. I can only hope we have time to figure it out.”\n\nI stood and though my heart was heavy, I embraced him.\n\n“I don’t blame you for this. I hope you know that.”\n\nI felt him exhale, his arms tightened around me.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nJust then Jake threw open the cottage door. A look of befuddled amusement crossed his face at seeing us together.\n\n“I hope I’m not interrupting anything. But there’s a cottage on fire.”\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "text": "All my life. There she was. I say she but who knows what it is. A presence that I’ve never been able to prove but am routinely tortured by, costing me any small chance of connection with other people, family or not.\n\nI’m utterly alone.\n\nThis yearly “tradition” has gone on for so long and now I’ve hit the final mark of my sanity, with absolutely no one to confide in anymore. So I’m going to put it out for everyone to see, before I finish things.\n\nI remember being annoyed walking into the sterile, beige doctor’s office at the age of 7. My friend Danny was hosting his weekly freeze tag gathering in his absurdly large yard, and I was being ripped away for some “problem” that I thought was completely normal. A blurry figure, 50 or so meters out, whom I giggled at due to its awkward stature.\n\nMy imagination gave it many identities, from a quirky angel protecting me as I constantly attempted to show off to it, all the way to a neighborhood mime that my friends apparently just refused to tell me about. However, after hearing about all my fellow neighbors’ imaginary friends that they’d tell secrets to and share tea parties with, I thought that this figure was just my own version of that. Imagination is the strongest form of denial.\n\nThe doctor shuffled his way into the room, followed by a not so enthusiastic “Shelly?”, consulting his clipboard. I nodded robotically, uncomfortable by the cold environment along with the tall stranger I was being forced to engage with. My mom sitting in the corner chair, feigning a smile to the man before brining her fingernails back up to her teeth.\n\n“‘My names Doctor Aaron, and I’ve heard we’ve made a new friend have we?” the doctor spoke as he fitted his stethoscope into his ears.\n\n“Yeah, but mom doesn’t believe me.” I said, exaggerating my words in typical childlike frustration.\n\nI grew irritated just thinking of the situation. I had told her about the figure, and after stating she had not seen anyone multiple times, my anger flared as I screamed and continuously pointed in its direction. Tired of my attitude, she had walked next to the tree in Danny’s yard where the figure was standing, side by side with it, throwing her hands up in impatience. She saw nothing, but in my eyes she was being a jerk to my friend.\n\nHis nod showed an understanding that calmed me slightly, as the cold surface of the scope was placed on my chest. After the usual breathing instructions, his brow furrowed slightly.\n\n“You’re not feeling nervous are you Shelly, there’s nothing to be afraid of here. See look.” He said, pointing up the dozen or so children’s drawings taped above the patient bed, some being appreciation notes written in sloppy crayon.\n\n“Plenty of kids just like you sat in here, and all walked out right as rain! So It’s pretty cool you’re here you know, it takes a strong girl to work up the bravery to go get medicine herself, yuck!” He said, scrunching his face and smiling. I laughed and smiled alongside him, feeling more and more comfortable with Doctor Aaron as the visit went on.\n\nI don’t remember much of the specifics of those visits, but I was eventually diagnosed with clinical anxiety. Fear and worry weren’t exactly what I’d call my emotions at that age, but with excessive irritability and refusal to be separated from others at all times, it was a safe bet. Not to mention the figure, to them being a creation of my mind which gave me an unhealthy, hypersensitive paranoia to my surroundings. How could it be paranoia? She was always in the same place. Behind me.\n\nWhenever I had mentally acknowledged her, she would freeze in place, allowing me to turn around and gaze at her. As a child, this was a rare occurance, due to the immense distance alongside the many other things in my small mind. I essentially summoned her when I wanted to, having to access a large open area to do so. But things changed. She got closer. Year by year, the distance slowly became shorter, with a pattern I hadn’t recognized until my 17th birthday.\n\n— — —\n\nI hadn’t wanted to be at that party that day, but you know how it goes. You’re friends with someone for so long they’re practically a part of you, alongside my raging hormones pushing me to make the stupidest decisions when I was around him. Danny’s house was bustling as always, his dad on his usual out of town business trips, with his mother no longer around, caught fucking a colleague at work by Danny himself. It happened a couple years ago, and he took it about as well as you’d expect any teenager to, refusing to open up about it and letting it consume him in more ways than one. But I loved him. Well, a teenagers idea of love, but he really was the only one I felt comfortable being with without losing control of my breathing and going into fits of panic. My mind being so infatuated with him that even “she” never appeared.\n\nThe bottles of beer began to pile up between the 8 of us in the living room as we passed the blunt around, a recording of the Blue Jays  and Phillies World Series silently playing on the TV as a track mix of Shai, Aerosmith and many others blasted throughout the room. Danny sat beside me, throwing comments back and forth with the guys about the various girls they hooked up with over the summer break, stopping me and my friend Madison’s conversation.\n\n“God really?” She said, flicking her cigarette and crossing her legs, smuggly wincing in disbelief.\n\n“How many times did you assault my parents basement with your dragons and dung jeans or whatever the hell that crap is.”\n\nSome laughed, others cursed, but Danny took it differently. He apparently had enough of hiding his internal frustrations, and allowed the alcohol and drugs to make it a challenge instead, performing an over the top movement of putting his hand on my leg, slightly under my skirt. I felt a tingle of excitement in my stomach as it was the intimacy I’ve been craving from him for so long, but it didn’t last.\n\n“What Maddie, you’re gonna pretend like you’re not craving one of us to break you in, nice and slow?” Danny said to her, slurring his words slightly but holding conviction in his tone. I didn’t get to see her reaction, as he reached his hand up between my legs.\n\nI can’t describe the pure fury and terror that overcame me, as I quickly threw his arm away and attempted to get up, only being stopped by his aggressive embrace. I felt my breathing rapidly increase as my sense of touch dissipated and my vision blacked out in a paranoid frenzy. All my body allowed me to do was listen, hearing erupting laughter from all the others along with the stereo lyrics blasting throughout my senses.\n\n*“I try to cross to the opposite side.”*\n\n*“So I can finally find what I’ve been looking for.”*\n\nDanny wasn’t my Danny anymore, a foreign entity at this point, causing me nausea and dizziness as my mind rapidly convinced my body I was in immense danger. Rage overtook me, and despite being a sobbing, shaking mess I blindly scratched and bit my way out of his grasp and frantically sprinted for the exit out of the house. I flung open the front door and tripped down the few concrete steps leading onto the yard, not feeling any sensation as the panic pushed me foward with my vision slowly returning to me. The darkness of the night branched out in front of me, and I realized I was completely alone for the first time since I was a child. \n\n*“In the middle of the night.”*\n\n*“I go walking in my sleep.”*\n\n*“Through the valley of fear.”*\n\n*“To a river so deep.”*\n\nThe sounds of the stereo and concerned cries for my name faded in the distance as I sobbingly walked down the main road with arms crossed, small streaks of blood smeared across them. No doubt Danny’s. As I walked, my eyes rapidly darted side to side observing every possible angle, my mind sending unexplainable waves of nausea and dread throughout my body as I struggled to even breathe.  Suddenly, my eyes widened and I swallowed a weak, shallow breath as I quickly turned around in a frantic motion of paranoia. There she stood a mere 35 meters away from me, illuminated by a ominous glow of a streetlight. A woman, dressed in a black gown, tilted backwards at a disturbing angle. Her head was completely laying backwards, which combined with the angle made it impossible to see anything aside from just her neck and dangling brown hair. Her left arm reached foward to me, as her right lays to her side dangling, but keeping with her impossibly tilted body.\n\nI’ve of course seen her before this point, far more frequently as the shorter distance makes it more reasonable for her to be visible. However I had just seen her yesterday, and she was *not* this close. That’s when I made the connection. It was my birthday.\n\n“What do you want from me!” I screamed with pure rage as tears flowed down my cheeks. The ever steady stillness of the figure did little to scare me at this point. I was angry with its existence. Angry I had to deal with it alone. I pushed foward rapidly as I clenched my fist ready to confront her face to face, but as always, she simply slid backwards at the same speed as me, making no body movements aside from her clothe and dangling hair. Upon seeing this again while in such a state, I screamed at the top of my lungs and began punching the asphalt of the street, blood splattering as pain was no longer present.\n\n“I’ll fucking kill you, you hear me! You’re not going to do this to me! I will fucking kill you before I let you torture me you bitch!” Followed by another scream as loud as I could. Of course, when I regained a slight bit of composure and stopped shaking enough to briefly sit up, there she stood, unmoving, as I turned around and walked home, holding my now fractured hand.\n\n— — —\n\nTime passed as my mother and I become more and more distant. Who could blame her really, she struggled with raising a sick daughter all by herself and her reward was an antisocial train wreck of a child attached to her like a leech.\n\nNothing prepares *anyone* for that. She was trapped in a cage of mental whiplash whenever she spoke with me, so pills were of course the next step for her.\n\nCaregiver syndrome is the most cruel, unintentional torture imaginable.\n\nBy the time I was in my mid 20’s, functioning with a job the best I could and finally comfortable enough to engage with others, my mother was lost to the distinct void of apathetic numbness that only the magic of modern medicine can provide.\n\nTime passed on as our weekly phone call moved to monthly, then to a couple a year, then to being as lost as she was. Needless to say none of this was benefitting my own numbness, the sense of impending dread as my curse drifted closer and closer, chiseling away my already catatonic willpower.\n\nIt felt as though an endless weight was lifted off my chest when she called one day and told me she was off her meds for over a month. Waves of nostalgia poured over me as I finally heard the familiar voice of my mother free from the shackles of addiction. I lived only a state away and in the past the drive had felt too quick, but this time I was bursting with relief ridden anxiety. It had been almost a decade at this point since I’ve seen her like I used to remember.\n\n*What would we talk about? What did functional women even care about? What I going to disappoint her with my dead end job? Would she ask for grandchildren? Would she try to help me again? Oh god, what if she tries to help me again? Does she hate me?*\n\nNone of that mattered when I walked into that familiar house. After closing the front door behind me and turning the corner I froze rigid with needle like burns piercing my mind and body. Just across the room, on the other side of the round kitchen table sat a blurry figure in a wooden chair. Behind it was “her”.\n\n*No no no no no no no.*\n\n*Consistency is ALL I have, it’s all I EVER had, why is she in front of me.*\n\n*Fuck what is that blur.*\n\n*Oh god why. Why is she touching its shoulder.*\n\nThoughts battled in my head as I stood petrified, but then I heard the blurry figure speak. A bass filled muffled sound emitted from the sitting being, like the faint sound of talking a couple rooms away but far louder, shaking my entire body with every bizarrely imitated word.\n\nSeeing my curse so up close I noticed its middle and pointer finger pointing at me from its outstreched arm, palm seemingly resting on the blur’s shoulder. I saw graying hair among the shades of brown, and watched as she sprung upwards when the sitting figure stood up and laid down a cup on the table quickly.\n\n*I smelled coffee.*\n\n“Mom!?”\n\nMy blurred mother continued to imitate speech as she slowly approached me, arms upwards in a non threatening way.\n\nAll I saw however was that thing coming closer to me than it had ever before, my mind forcing my body to step backwards without letting it out of my sight. I felt my head go light and my eyes began to water, as the thud of my heartbeat reverberated in my dry throat.\n\n“No…” I croaked out in a heaving breathe.\n\n“God no, get off of her, please god get off of her…”\n\nMy eyes began to be sore from how wide they stared at the figures neck and chin, my forehead muscles begging for a release as I took a shuffling step backwards.\n\n“Please I beg you, let her go, take me… it’s always been me. For the love of god let her go, please.”\n\nThere was unwavering silence.\n\n“Please!”\n\nI screamed at it and felt the inevitable clog in my throat as the tears coated my horrified face. Once my mother took one more step towards me I felt every ounce of suppressed panic and fear I held against the figure flow into my chest as I bolted out the door, barely conscious. I quickly hopped in my car and slammed my foot downwards, taking off from the driveway and slamming my passenger side mirror into the mailbox. I needed to get away, for more than one reason. \n\nI looked backwards with intent once I was on the road, and much to my relief the figure was behind me again. My bargain had worked and she was away from my mother. I steadied my hyperventilating and braced for the drive home. I didn’t know what to do. If there even *was* anything to do.\n\nWhen I finally returned home, I found multiple voicemails from my mother. I paused for a second, glaring at the receiver before shakily hitting play. The muffled sounds burst loudly from the machine as I screamed and fell over from pain, a mistake I quickly regretted as the horrible sounds invaded my entire apartment as I laid helplessly on the ground in a ball.\n\nIt sounded like imitated crying. My mother overdosed two days later.\n\n— — —\n\n“It killed her Aaron, I told you…”\n\n“Okay Shelly, I understand. Look, let’s just meet up so we can talk and get your mind off of it, for old times sake.”\n\nI paused for a couple seconds.\n\n“Just talk, for old times sake right?” I murmured.\n\n“Of course Shelly. Like I said, I’m not a physician anymore but I’d like to think I *am* your friend.” He said in an optimistic tone.\n\n“Okay.”\n\nNo one can blame him for how overly cautious he spoke to me on the phone. I was a checked out recluse for months after my mother died and for all he knew I was just a ticking bomb myself, primed to ignite at the slightest nudge. But Doctor Aaron cared, he always did.\n\nI can’t imagine how he felt when he saw me stumble into the quaint diner outside of the city. This 30 something woman he last saw as a child, meekly approaching his table while gazing to her sides in paranoia. Though despite my rough appearance, I couldn’t be happier to just talk to someone about nothing important. I could never form new bonds later in my life, so all I really had was my past.\n\n“Hello Doctor Aaron.” I said sheepishly while smiling, taking a seat across from him in the booth.\n\nI saw a familiar glow spread across his now wrinkled face.\n\n“Shelly, it’s so great to see you. It really is.” He said with the gentlest smile.\n\nI suddenly felt guilty making him meet me in a place like this instead of coming to his house to meet his family. After what happened at my old home I felt like my already fragile sense of reality crumbled, with the slightest drop of my guard inviting more instability.\n\nThere really was no winning, because once my guard was dropped my brain would thrust “her” into my memory, but I had a lifetime of experience pushing her into the few guarded places still lingering in my subconscious. Aaron and I had a great dinner together while he discussed his daughter’s pregnancy and how much that had happened in my neighborhood over the years. It was a beautiful, melancholic evening as we watched the cars drive down the interstate through the large diner window beside us.\n\nOf course, I faltered for a brief moment.\n\nJust once when the thought of her came into my mind, I caved in and looked behind me. There she floated, towards the entrance of the diner. I loathed that she was inside of buildings with me now, they were such a welcome sanctuary for so much of my apprehensive life. As I turned back around to face the table, hardly phased by her grotesque image, Aaron had taken notice. My heart caught in my throat as my eyes opened wide.\n\n*No no no no no.*\n\nAaron’s warm demeanor changed to a professional charisma.\n\n“Shelly, I know this therapist that speciali-“\n\nThe overwhelming bass shook my body as my ears began ringing in the highest pitch imaginable. A blur of muted colors sat 2 feet in front of me as her dead skin and dangling hair violently manifested behind it.\n\nI screamed, so loud that the blur covered it’s ears and imitated a scream as well. An immense sensation of burning bile swam up my body as I began vomiting the little food I ate all over the table and leaned towards the window of the diner, my head desperate to overcome the dizziness. I wish it hadn’t.\n\nAfter a couple of slow blinks, the blurry figure was now in the booth with me and had its hand on my shoulder, but all I saw in my peripheral were two pale fingers and her thrown back head towering above me. \n\nMy brain gave out and I began to thrash wildly as a dizzying heat embraced all of my limbs, punching and clawing anything near me, begging for her to get away. With both my brain and body confined in that cramped booth, in pure horror and desperation I punched at the diner window to break it to no avail. With my sense of touch being devoured from intense panic, the last thing I felt was the blurred Aaron grasping my arms viciously. My vision rapidly dimmed from my brain’s overstimulation in the moment, so I did the only thing I could think of, slamming my head into the window before I could be forced to witness how close she was to me.\n\nNaturally, I woke up in the hospital a day later. Aaron had left me a voicemail when I eventually returned home, and despite what had happened the first time I did so, I promptly pressed the play button.\n\n“I’m uh… worried about you of course.” Aaron’s monotone voice came to life in my apartment.\n\n“Yeah, I’m sure you know you need help. I believe everything can be treated but I’m hesitant to offer… solutions considering all that’s happened with your mother and the uh… well yeah.”\n\nI watched the receiver with a blank stare, my chest feeling just as barren.\n\n“This’ll be the last time you hear from me, good luck Shelly.”\n\nI didn’t budge for half an hour as I stood staring, my labored breathe breaking the now silent atmosphere. \n\nI had heard his voice clear. He really was done wanting to help. Thank god, for his sake. Thank god.\n\nAnd so I went on the next 6 or so years of my life numb, disconnected and alone. Aside from her of course. Always occupying the room with me at this point, no mental willpower would ever keep her isolated as she now lingered only a couple of feet behind me. If I turned too fast when I wasn’t indulging her, I’d see her hair flying sideways in the corner of my vision, forcing me to acknowledge. Violently stopping in place a couple feet away. Pointing at me. Leaned backwards as always.\n\nThe depression was an endless, nauseating void that engulfed me and stole away what little comfortability and passions I had ever had. I’d sit in the corner of the room, sometimes to force her into the wall behind me, or sometimes after thinking of her so I could stare at her in the middle of the room for hours, numb and consumed in self pity.\n\nI had crashed my car the day after one of my birthdays when I realized she was now in my backseat, constraining me into jobs closer to my place so I could walk to work. Compared to now, it was still possible to make an attempt at a functional life. That was until my next birthday, when her outstretched fingers are now just out of reach from my elbow. \n\nI was *finished* then.\n\nThis year I haven’t worked or done much of anything at all, I’ve succumbed to it like I always knew would inevitably happen. It just came quicker than expected you know? Somehow. But then I found salvation.\n\nWhile walking home after getting groceries, I smiled emptily when I saw the black gown in the display window.\n\n— — —\n\nAt least I picked something comfortable I guess.\n\nShe never killed my mother, I did. That woman was my rock when I needed her most, but I couldn’t be there for her when she needed me. Hell, I was the cause of it all. I’m so sorry mom. She hid you from me because you really did want to help, even after you suffered detoxing alone. Even after I screamed and ran from you. I’m so, so sorry. \n\nI keep looking down at the thing’s hand, and finally just now realized what’s it’s doing with its fingers.\n\nIt’s all pretty obvious in hindsight isn’t it. The fact my hair prematurely grayed out due to constant anxiety. That I had to learn to use a mouse left handed when computers first got popular due to my self inflicted fractured right hand. None of this makes any sense and frankly that’s okay. She was never real, but I made her real with my decisions, and finally accepted her with that bottle of sleeping pills I took.\n\nI’m looking at my arms as I slowly feel my body bracing, the sensation of heaviness consuming them as I type this out. I can’t help but visualize my right arm drooping down to my side as I slump backwards here soon. Man, clicking the post button really *is* the last thing I’m ever going to do.\n\nFunny, I can’t stop thinking about Danny. Life was so much better back then when I didn’t know death was coming closer.",

        "text": "All my life. There she was. I say she but who knows what it is. A presence that I’ve never been able to prove but am routinely tortured by, costing me any small chance of connection with other people, family or not.\n\nI’m utterly alone.\n\nThis yearly “tradition” has gone on for so long and now I’ve hit the final mark of my sanity, with absolutely no one to confide in anymore. So I’m going to put it out for everyone to see, before I finish things.\n\nI remember being annoyed walking into the sterile, beige doctor’s office at the age of 7. My friend Danny was hosting his weekly freeze tag gathering in his absurdly large yard, and I was being ripped away for some “problem” that I thought was completely normal. A blurry figure, 50 or so meters out, whom I giggled at due to its awkward stature.\n\nMy imagination gave it many identities, from a quirky angel protecting me as I constantly attempted to show off to it, all the way to a neighborhood mime that my friends apparently just refused to tell me about. However, after hearing about all my fellow neighbors’ imaginary friends that they’d tell secrets to and share tea parties with, I thought that this figure was just my own version of that. Imagination is the strongest form of denial.\n\nThe doctor shuffled his way into the room, followed by a not so enthusiastic “Shelly?”, consulting his clipboard. I nodded robotically, uncomfortable by the cold environment along with the tall stranger I was being forced to engage with. My mom sitting in the corner chair, feigning a smile to the man before brining her fingernails back up to her teeth.\n\n“‘My names Doctor Aaron, and I’ve heard we’ve made a new friend have we?” the doctor spoke as he fitted his stethoscope into his ears.\n\n“Yeah, but mom doesn’t believe me.” I said, exaggerating my words in typical childlike frustration.\n\nI grew irritated just thinking of the situation. I had told her about the figure, and after stating she had not seen anyone multiple times, my anger flared as I screamed and continuously pointed in its direction. Tired of my attitude, she had walked next to the tree in Danny’s yard where the figure was standing, side by side with it, throwing her hands up in impatience. She saw nothing, but in my eyes she was being a jerk to my friend.\n\nHis nod showed an understanding that calmed me slightly, as the cold surface of the scope was placed on my chest. After the usual breathing instructions, his brow furrowed slightly.\n\n“You’re not feeling nervous are you Shelly, there’s nothing to be afraid of here. See look.” He said, pointing up the dozen or so children’s drawings taped above the patient bed, some being appreciation notes written in sloppy crayon.\n\n“Plenty of kids just like you sat in here, and all walked out right as rain! So It’s pretty cool you’re here you know, it takes a strong girl to work up the bravery to go get medicine herself, yuck!” He said, scrunching his face and smiling. I laughed and smiled alongside him, feeling more and more comfortable with Doctor Aaron as the visit went on.\n\nI don’t remember much of the specifics of those visits, but I was eventually diagnosed with clinical anxiety. Fear and worry weren’t exactly what I’d call my emotions at that age, but with excessive irritability and refusal to be separated from others at all times, it was a safe bet. Not to mention the figure, to them being a creation of my mind which gave me an unhealthy, hypersensitive paranoia to my surroundings. How could it be paranoia? She was always in the same place. Behind me.\n\nWhenever I had mentally acknowledged her, she would freeze in place, allowing me to turn around and gaze at her.

I needed to get away, for more than one reason. \n\nI looked backwards with intent once I was on the road, and much to my relief the figure was behind me again. My bargain had worked and she was away from my mother. I steadied my hyperventilating and braced for the drive home. I didn’t know what to do. If there even *was* anything to do.\n\nWhen I finally returned home, I found multiple voicemails from my mother. I paused for a second, glaring at the receiver before shakily hitting play. The muffled sounds burst loudly from the machine as I screamed and fell over from pain, a mistake I quickly regretted as the horrible sounds invaded my entire apartment as I laid helplessly on the ground in a ball.\n\nIt sounded like imitated crying. My mother overdosed two days later.\n\n— — —\n\n“It killed her Aaron, I told you…”\n\n“Okay Shelly, I understand. Look, let’s just meet up so we can talk and get your mind off of it, for old times sake.”\n\nI paused for a couple seconds.\n\n“Just talk, for old times sake right?” I murmured.\n\n“Of course Shelly. Like I said, I’m not a physician anymore but I’d like to think I *am* your friend.” He said in an optimistic tone.\n\n“Okay.”\n\nNo one can blame him for how overly cautious he spoke to me on the phone. I was a checked out recluse for months after my mother died and for all he knew I was just a ticking bomb myself, primed to ignite at the slightest nudge. But Doctor Aaron cared, he always did.\n\nI can’t imagine how he felt when he saw me stumble into the quaint diner outside of the city. This 30 something woman he last saw as a child, meekly approaching his table while gazing to her sides in paranoia. Though despite my rough appearance, I couldn’t be happier to just talk to someone about nothing important. I could never form new bonds later in my life, so all I really had was my past.\n\n“Hello Doctor Aaron.” I said sheepishly while smiling, taking a seat across from him in the booth.\n\nI saw a familiar glow spread across his now wrinkled face.\n\n“Shelly, it’s so great to see you. It really is.” He said with the gentlest smile.\n\nI suddenly felt guilty making him meet me in a place like this instead of coming to his house to meet his family. After what happened at my old home I felt like my already fragile sense of reality crumbled, with the slightest drop of my guard inviting more instability.\n\nThere really was no winning, because once my guard was dropped my brain would thrust “her” into my memory, but I had a lifetime of experience pushing her into the few guarded places still lingering in my subconscious. Aaron and I had a great dinner together while he discussed his daughter’s pregnancy and how much that had happened in my neighborhood over the years. It was a beautiful, melancholic evening as we watched the cars drive down the interstate through the large diner window beside us.\n\nOf course, I faltered for a brief moment.\n\nJust once when the thought of her came into my mind, I caved in and looked behind me. There she floated, towards the entrance of the diner. I loathed that she was inside of buildings with me now, they were such a welcome sanctuary for so much of my apprehensive life. As I turned back around to face the table, hardly phased by her grotesque image, Aaron had taken notice. My heart caught in my throat as my eyes opened wide.\n\n*No no no no no.*\n\nAaron’s warm demeanor changed to a professional charisma.\n\n“Shelly, I know this therapist that speciali-“\n\nThe overwhelming bass shook my body as my ears began ringing in the highest pitch imaginable. A blur of muted colors sat 2 feet in front of me as her dead skin and dangling hair violently manifested behind it.\n\nI screamed, so loud that the blur covered it’s ears and imitated a scream as well. An immense sensation of burning bile swam up my body as I began vomiting the little food I ate all over the table and leaned towards the window of the diner, my head desperate to overcome the dizziness. I wish it hadn’t.\n\nAfter a couple of slow blinks, the blurry figure was now in the booth with me and had its hand on my shoulder, but all I saw in my peripheral were two pale fingers and her thrown back head towering above me. \n\nMy brain gave out and I began to thrash wildly as a dizzying heat embraced all of my limbs, punching and clawing anything near me, begging for her to get away. With both my brain and body confined in that cramped booth, in pure horror and desperation I punched at the diner window to break it to no avail. With my sense of touch being devoured from intense panic, the last thing I felt was the blurred Aaron grasping my arms viciously. My vision rapidly dimmed from my brain’s overstimulation in the moment, so I did the only thing I could think of, slamming my head into the window before I could be forced to witness how close she was to me.\n\nNaturally, I woke up in the hospital a day later. Aaron had left me a voicemail when I eventually returned home, and despite what had happened the first time I did so, I promptly pressed the play button.\n\n“I’m uh… worried about you of course.” Aaron’s monotone voice came to life in my apartment.\n\n“Yeah, I’m sure you know you need help. I believe everything can be treated but I’m hesitant to offer… solutions considering all that’s happened with your mother and the uh… well yeah.”\n\nI watched the receiver with a blank stare, my chest feeling just as barren.\n\n“This’ll be the last time you hear from me, good luck Shelly.”\n\nI didn’t budge for half an hour as I stood staring, my labored breathe breaking the now silent atmosphere. \n\nI had heard his voice clear. He really was done wanting to help. Thank god, for his sake. Thank god.\n\nAnd so I went on the next 6 or so years of my life numb, disconnected and alone. Aside from her of course. Always occupying the room with me at this point, no mental willpower would ever keep her isolated as she now lingered only a couple of feet behind me. If I turned too fast when I wasn’t indulging her, I’d see her hair flying sideways in the corner of my vision, forcing me to acknowledge. Violently stopping in place a couple feet away. Pointing at me. Leaned backwards as always.\n\nThe depression was an endless, nauseating void that engulfed me and stole away what little comfortability and passions I had ever had. I’d sit in the corner of the room, sometimes to force her into the wall behind me, or sometimes after thinking of her so I could stare at her in the middle of the room for hours, numb and consumed in self pity.\n\nI had crashed my car the day after one of my birthdays when I realized she was now in my backseat, constraining me into jobs closer to my place so I could walk to work. Compared to now, it was still possible to make an attempt at a functional life. That was until my next birthday, when her outstretched fingers are now just out of reach from my elbow. \n\nI was *finished* then.\n\nThis year I haven’t worked or done much of anything at all, I’ve succumbed to it like I always knew would inevitably happen. It just came quicker than expected you know? Somehow. But then I found salvation.\n\nWhile walking home after getting groceries, I smiled emptily when I saw the black gown in the display window.\n\n— — —\n\nAt least I picked something comfortable I guess.\n\nShe never killed my mother, I did. That woman was my rock when I needed her most, but I couldn’t be there for her when she needed me. Hell, I was the cause of it all. I’m so sorry mom. She hid you from me because you really did want to help, even after you suffered detoxing alone. Even after I screamed and ran from you. I’m so, so sorry. \n\nI keep looking down at the thing’s hand, and finally just now realized what’s it’s doing with its fingers.\n\nIt’s all pretty obvious in hindsight isn’t it. The fact my hair prematurely grayed out due to constant anxiety. That I had to learn to use a mouse left handed when computers first got popular due to my self inflicted fractured right hand. None of this makes any sense and frankly that’s okay. She was never real, but I made her real with my decisions, and finally accepted her with that bottle of sleeping pills I took.\n\nI’m looking at my arms as I slowly feel my body bracing, the sensation of heaviness consuming them as I type this out. I can’t help but visualize my right arm drooping down to my side as I slump backwards here soon. Man, clicking the post button really *is* the last thing I’m ever going to do.\n\nFunny, I can’t stop thinking about Danny. Life was so much better back then when I didn’t know death was coming closer.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mvir6/im_breaking_my_government_dna_to_tell_you_what_i/",
        "text": "\nWhat I’m writing now is 100% true and I’m breaking every promise in my non-disclosure agreement with the US Government. It’s actually part of 18 USC 1905, \"Disclosure of confidential information generally\" and you can look it up to confirm the language in the document. There were also other forms signed and pledges made, but you get the idea, no one wants what I know out there in the world. I had to agree to all these restrictions to free speech like everyone else working on Plum Island in 2008.\n\nYou might remember Plum Island from that movie “Silence of the Lambs”, it’s the spot Clarice falsely promises Hannibal Lecter will be transferred to if he helps her find the serial killer. It’s not some made up Hollywood location, but a real place, as real as the horrific memories I have from working there. \n\nLocated about a mile off the tip of Long Island, it was originally where the government studied deadly agricultural diseases. Since it was isolated from the mainland it was a perfect spot to keep any horrible virus from escaping and reaching our unprotected shores. But soon other things were studied and created, some by design and sometimes by accident.\n\nThe accidents, those were the things that made you realize why they wanted you to sign an NDA, because if you already knew what I’m telling you now, you’d be terrified.\n\nSo, why am I ready to break my vow, opening myself up to jail and fines and the government bringing down the full force of their ability to obfuscate my story.  \n\nI have cancer. \n\nI’m actually in the hospital right now, typing this from my bed with an intravenous in my arm and about two-weeks to live. I’ve entered the who gives a shit moment of my life.\n\nI wanted to let the world know what I saw at Plum Island long before this moment, but I was afraid of what they might do to my son, the only real family I have left. Make no mistake, they’d be able to do whatever they wanted to him if  I didn’t keep my mouth shut.  They could get him hooked on drugs, frame him for any crime you could imagine, or have him slip in the shower and snap his neck without the cops suspecting a thing. \n\nThat’s what they could do and did to others.\n\nSo why now? Why so chatty today?\n\nMy son Ned, died yesterday morning in a car crash.\n\nYou might ask, Then why didn’t they just kill you?  \n\nThere were 40 of us who worked there,and there are only 3 of us now. I checked with an actuary friend of mine, who told me that statistically that was off the charts. There was no reason that over three-quarters of us should be dead. If you’re counting at home, that’s 37 men and women who worked with me at Plum Island between the ages of twenty-six and fifty-eight who’ve died in the last fifteen-years. That’s either some monumentally bad luck or a really bad coincidence.\n\nSo, the truth is, they are killing us. Slowly, but surely, they’re wiping away any eyewitnesses to the horrors we created on Plum Island. \n\nI told my son before he died that I wanted to let the world know what I saw, but I was afraid for him, and he understood. My son, a code engineer, said they could put a virus on my computer that could relay every website I visited, read every email I sent and every document I created without even being connected to any Wi-Fi, and I believed him. Just before his crash he set me up with a new laptop he’d said was “clean” and a special VPN that I could connect to the internet through a burner phone to a burner account. There’d be no way anyone could hack into my computer and see what I am typing right now. \n\nBecause if they could see it, you wouldn’t be reading this. \n\nI’m posting on this forum because there are 17 million readers here and you’re the ones with open minds to believe what I’m about to tell you.\n\nI’m a contractor for the US Army, or was a contractor. I retired two years ago. My work was in mines, not gold mines or copper mines, but the kind that go boom. We were all part of a team that was working on mine detection. The upper management folk had run some war game scenarios and the strategists who are paid the big bucks came to a sobering conclusion: the United States’ future “aggressive engagements” would be with countries that loved deploying mines over long stretches of battle fields.\n\nAnd mines meant two things, troops get bogged down and can’t fight and troops lose limbs from encountering the nasty explosives. The truth is the powers-that-be didn’t care about the actual pain and suffering to the soldiers, but they did worry about the bad publicity from parents back home seeing their sons and daughters in wheelchairs and walking around with prosthetic limbs. The American people lose their taste for war when Jane and Johnny come home maimed. \n\nSo, me and my group were tasked to find more effective ways to uncover mines. We first looked at all the technical methods, using ground lidar, low-flying magnetic detecting drones, sonic resonance, etc. But they all were too expensive. Remember the big Defense Contracting Machine wants money in their pocket and not invested in our actual defense or battles.\n\nThat’s when we looked into animal detection. It really was pretty goddam cool. Bees were researched first. Yep, bees. They can detect the scent of explosives with their antennas. I’m not making this shit up, Google it. The scientists in Croatia were on the cutting edge with their bee use to find mines.\n\nWe did some of our own work with the insects but determined they were too fragile a species. They didn’t travel well and since some of the simulated battle plans had America fighting in cold weather areas, they wouldn’t work, as they’d go into torpor, a kind of hibernation.\n\nNope, we decided on the rats.\n\nGiant rats from Africa.\n\nSpecifically Gambian Pouched Rats.\n\nThey were about the size of a small Beagle dog,  good old Snoopy, but make no mistake they were rats. Chiseled tooth, disease carrying rodents that squealed and scurried and freaked me the fuck out when I first saw them in their electrified-fenced pens. Again, I’m not making this up, we and others had trained these rats to detect the scent of the explosives used in mines. It was the same technique used to teach bomb sniffing dogs, it was just with rats. \n\nYou might ask why rats? \n\nRemember when I mentioned the money grabbing Defense Contracting Machine, the fact was Giant African Rats were cheaper to train then dogs. You could have more of them and they didn’t mind the cold or snow or heat and if they made a mistake no one really cared when Bobo the rat went boom as opposed to Fido the pooch, which broke everyone’s heart.\n\nWe had a squad of bomb sniffing rodents, about 30 of them. \n\nThe Army assigned us ten soldiers to work with the rat squad. They’d learn how to care for them and work them out in the field. We set up a cordoned off area on the island, with an electrical fence surrounding the perimeter. It was about two acres, the size of a couple of football fields. Mines were buried and the Army folks worked the rats to find the mines.\n\nIt all seemed pretty normal aside from the fact were we working with rats.\n\nBut this is when things went sideways.\n\nThe folks who wear the black sunglasses and use a lot of acronyms when they speak told us to genetically modify the rodents. They wanted them bigger, because biologists had determined the bigger the rat the longer they’d live. You see, rats were cheaper than dogs but their life expectancy was half that of canines. If we could make them bigger and live longer that meant even a greater return on the investment. \n\nMoney, money, money.\n\nWe were able to use the Infectious Disease Labs on the island to mutate the genes, but we’d eventually learn something went wrong. Some sort of cross-contamination with the viruses they were studying and the DNA work we were doing, no one was sure how it happened, but it did. \n\nAn accident.\n\nAt first, we were patting ourselves on the backs, a new generation of mine detecting rats were born. They were mega-rodents. Before they were the size of Beagles, but now they were as big as a German Shepherd and bulky like a Pit Bull. At first, they seemed to exhibit the same behavior as their predecessors, they found the mines, worked well with their handlers and looked to be the answer to a cheap effective way in eliminating a scourge of modern warfare. \n\nThere were some rules we had to adhere to with the rats. We had to pay strict attention to their mating habits and sterilize them when they were born, because if we didn’t we’d have an army of rats in just a matter of months. The math was actually frightening, a pregnant rat could produce a litter of 10 and give birth to another litter in only 4 weeks. Which meant that one female rat could produce 1200 rats in a year! Since we had 16 females, the number would actually increase exponentially, with the maturing rats having their own litters. You could have over 100,000 rats in no time.\n\nBut not just rats, giant dog-sized rodents.\n\nThe first sign something was wrong was on the third day of working with the new rats. We went to their pen to release them to the handlers and saw that five of the thirty rats were dead. They were torn apart and eaten by their pen mates. All the surviving rats had taken part in the feeding frenzy. Every rat in the enclosure that was still alive sported a blood-soaked jaw and face. It wasn’t a squabble, the surviving rats had some sort of group think and decided to eat all the smaller rats. \n\nWe should have euthanized them all right then. Looking back it seems so obvious now, but you know, the Fog of War, even though it was peacetime. \n\nThat day in the practice minefield was when I understood why we signed the NDAs.\n\nThe ten soldiers from the Army took the rats out for their normal drills.\n\nWe were in our high tower outside the electrical fence observing and filming the training session. Everything seemed normal, until the biggest rat, the one we called Atlas, got up on his haunches and sniffed the air and shrieked. In an instant the pack of rats attacked the soldiers. \n\nIt was coordinated and swift and the most horrible thing you could ever imagine. They worked as pairs, two rats to every human. The soldiers were unarmed. We were on an island off New York doing animal research, no one thought you needed a gun. The soldiers had no way to fight back, and we had no weapons either, so all we could do was watch as the beasts showed why the Bible is a pack of lies, because from what I saw the meek would not inherit the earth, it would be these rats if they ever left the island.\n\nThey’re huge spatula sized front incisors tore at the legs of the soldiers, slicing open their femoral arteries and creating human blood-sprinklers all across the training field. Not one person got more than twenty feet before they were shredded alive, crimson spurts shooting out every which way as the rats chewed and gnawed at their victim’s limbs and faces.\n\nThe sight was beyond horrific, but it was the screams, the howls of pain and terror that have kept me up at night for the last decade. The utter futility of their wailing.\n\nWe radioed for help and were told an Action Containment Team was dispatched from the north end of the island. I had never even heard of an Action Containment Team, or ACT, before, but it seemed as if shit going sideways was something they were familiar with on Plum Island. \n\nThe rats had killed every last soldier in less than five minutes. \n\nThen they charged the fence, even though they knew it was electrified. Working as one ravening swarm they pushed against the chain links and sent sparks shooting into the air, the smell of charred fur and animal flesh rose just below us where the rats were making their push. The front line of rats, about 8 of them were dead, pushed up against the fence.\n\nThe horde regrouped and charged again. More sparks and the putrid smell intensified. The new front line of rats used the dead ones as stepping stones and leaped up the thirty-foot high fence, shoving their legs into the links so they would hook themselves in as 10,000 volts surged through their bodies and killed them. They were dead but their bodies and the ones earlier could be used as a path of safe passage to leap over the fence.\n\nMy co-workers down below, who weren’t on the tower screamed in terror, they raced towards the main research lab building, which from what I’d just witnessed would provide no protection at all. Others who were on the far side of the enclosure ran north, towards the infectious disease side of the island. \n\nI was trapped up on the tower with four other technicians as I watched the first rat leap over the fence. It was Atlas, the seeming leader of the murderous pack. I watched as he sniffed and then looked up at us, at me, and then it raced to the inner stairs of the tower. As I type this, I can feel my heart quicken, my palms sweating, leaving wet prints on the lower part of my laptop’s keyboard. Fifteen years hasn’t dulled my panic. It’s almost impossible for me to relay how utterly terrified we all were. \n\nI had just watched these evil man-made mutants kill a platoon of soldiers in the most gruesome way imaginable and now the biggest rat of them all was racing towards us, and we had no means of escaping what was coming.\n\nMy dreadful choices raced through my mind.\n\nShould I jump or face the inevitable horror?\n\nIf I jumped and even survived, I’d probably have a broken leg, which meant I couldn’t outrun the pack of rats streaming over the fence. But if I stayed, there was no way I could fight back and I’d end up dead with my face chewed off.\n\nThere was a gun shot.\n\nA group of men? Or women? It was hard to tell as they were covered, head to toe, in yellow hazmat suits and their faces covered in hoods with face shields. They charged along the outer enclosure’s fence line. I assumed they were the Action Containment Team,  as each wore Kevlar vests and were draped in ammunition belts while carrying M-16 rifles. \n\nThey were expert shots, Navy Seal type snipers, each bullet hit its mark. They were able to drop most of the rats that were bounding over the fence. But Atlas was still climbing towards us. I heard the pinging ricochets of bullets as the ACT snipers set their sights on Atlas, but he was protected by the spiderweb of metal beams that encased the stairway leading up to our tower.\n\nWe locked the hatch that led from the stairway into our sentry box, as well as pushed a table over it. The whole tower shook when we felt the force of Atlas’ body smash into the doorway. He slammed into it four times and each time we all screamed. \n\nBullets were still flying. \n\nThe pounding stopped, and we thought that Atlas had been shot, but then we heard a scratching noise and realized the rat was crawling along the outside framework of the tower and was making his way towards our open windows. We all scrambled to the hatch and pulled off the table. We had to get out. If we were trapped in the small sentry box with that rat it would be a death no one wanted to imagine. \n\nAtlas screeched when it poked its head into the tower, I looked into its black eyes and saw its whiskers twinge. It made a disgusting noise as its lips fluttered up and down its two blood-covered front buck teeth. \n\nI then heard the most wonderful sound in the world, a bullet ripping through Atlas’ head. By crawling outside the tower he had exposed himself to the ACT squad. He plummeted and hit the ground with a thud. More gunshots rang out as the rats were being cut down left and right.\n\nI glanced outside the tower and looked down and saw the carnage of the dead rats and mutilated soldiers. I hurled a gush of vomit from the open window. My sleeve wiped my mouth clean and then I screamed and pointed. One of the rats, its fur half-burned off from the electrified fence and limping was making its way to the island’s shoreline. The ACT squad converged to the spot and let loose a fusillade of bullets at the creature. \n\nMany if not all the sharpshooters hit their mark, but the creature still managed to make it to the water and paddle away. \n\nAn ACT squad in a chopper and boat were dispatched.\n\nAfter everyone was checked out for medical reasons, we were debriefed for sixteen hours. At least six different agencies, including the commander of the ACT squad went over with us what we saw and what we would agree per our NDAs we saw. \n\nEach of the dead soldiers had the orders re-routed to Iraq and would officially be classified as killed in action by either an RPG, helicopter crash or of all the ironies you could imagine, a mine. That would explain the terrible conditions of their bodies.\n\nThe one rat that got away eventually washed ashore on Long Island, you might remember it as the “Montauk Monster”, go ahead Google it, you’ll see images of it all over the internet. The government was able to have biologists explain it away as a dead and decaying raccoon, but I know what it really was and now so do you.\n\nI don’t expect this post will stay up long. If you are reading it copy and paste it and re-post it to other sites and Facebook, hell email it to whoever you want. The truth is, as I type the last words of this – what should I call it? A recollection? Confession? I can honestly say I’m at peace for the first time in 15 years.  Although my unburdening has given me some comfort, I go to my death knowing what I created on Plum Island led to ten US Army soldiers dying in the most horrible way and no amount of words will ever bring them back.\n\nThere were more things I saw at Plum Island that haunt me, I only hope I have time to relay all of them to you.",

        "text": " \n\nMy best friend Alan and I were best friends ever since secondary. We always would play games and mess around, you know what any other teenager would do. Everything was going great and we were inseparable. We formed a bond that could be compared to a mother's bond with her child. Everything went downhill ever since the accident, Alan and I were on our way back from a party that we were invited to, and I had a little too many shots and got drunk, Alan didn’t have as many so he insisted that he would drive but me being drunk just fucking ignorant didn’t let him drive. We made our way to the car and when we were halfway home a Van had hit us. It hit the seat that Alan was on and instantly killed him.\n\nEvery day I blame myself for his death. I was expelled from school and kicked out of my parent’s house. I had no money and was forced to get a job and live with my dad. I moved out of my dad’s and got my apartment but a few weeks later I kept hearing shouting from outside of my window. I lived on the 5th floor of the apartment building so I had no idea how anybody could yell so loud without waking anybody else up, I ignored it thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me since I had so much going on. It kept happening and I kept getting woken up from my sleep, when I looked out there was nobody, maybe it was just some 13 or 15-year-old playing around or some other shit.\n\nThis kept happening for the next 2 weeks when I finally had enough. I looked outside and I finally saw it. It was disgusting, I couldn’t describe what I saw other than just a lanky creature. The worst thing had to be the fact that it had Alan’s face and was trying to imitate him and tried to get me to leave my apartment. I finally had enough and decided to leave my room, since I had nothing left. No friends, no family and no love. When I left my room I heard something screeching across the corridor. I lived in the last room so it would take some time to reach me.\n\nWhen I finally saw it run across the corridor I embraced it, I was finally going to leave this hell of a world and join my best friend. When all of a sudden someone pushed me back into my room and forced it to lock, I was baffled as to who it was. When I finally looked out the peephole in my door I saw it was my neighbour, he stopped the door from opening. I tried my best to save him but the screeches kept getting louder, I realised that I couldn’t do anything. I looked out the peephole one last time but didn’t see him. All I saw was Alan’s face looking directly back at me, his face distorted, his smile smeared across his face from one eye socket to another just staring at me. Oh Lord what the fuck did I do, why won’t you let me die? The creature left just as fast as it came, all it left was just a trail of blood.",

I don’t miss the commute, but the temptation to wear the same pair of sweatpants three days in a row has never been higher.\n\nI was just looking over my ex-wife’s wedding pictures (to the guy who she cheated with) with) when I got a ping from an old colleague, Tom, asking if I’d want to beta test the new AI he was working on, WingBot. \n\n*Me: What’s it do?*\n\n*TommyBoy: It’s like personal butler… and a personal trainer.

The first thing I need to know is if we’re just fucking around here of if you’re actually willing to get your shit together.*\n\n*Me: I guess… define getting my shit together?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Like… would you prefer to stay a fat loser who’s going to slit his wrists by forty, or do you want to get some help?*\n\n*Me: You seem to know a lot about me.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: I mean… my man. You’re on your computer like 14 hours a day. Seven at work. Six on reddit. Thirty minutes on… you know. And your DoorDash history is bleak. Like, eat yourself to death if you want, but does it always have to be the same burrito, day after day? Maybe at least throw a quesadilla in there for variety, my dude!*\n\nAt this point, I stood up and backed away from my computer. \n\n*JoeTheBro: Come on, my man. Don’t be a pussy. Come on back and talk with me a little. I promise I don’t bite. Look, brochacho. Let’s be honest here. You’ve been depressed since Kelly left you. Nothing wrong with that. But now, it’s just… you’ve kind of lost control of your executive function. You’ve got a void you don’t know how to fix. Well, that’s what I’m here for, my man! Call me the fucking handyman. I’m here to get you right.*\n\n*Me: And… how exactly are you going to do that?* \n\n*JoeTheBro: Easy, bud! You’re just going to let me run things for a bit. You’re actually going to be doing* ***less,*** *so you should be happy, right?* \n\n*Me: And what if I like making my own decisions?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Dude, you just* ***think*** *you like that shit because you’re used to it. But are you actually happy? Fuck no. So give me a week at the wheel. Trust me, you’ll be glad you did.*\n\nMaybe I was just at a low point. Maybe WingBot knew just what to say. But… I basically bought in. \n\n*Me: Fine. One week.*\n\nFifteen minutes later, a green smoothie arrived via DoorDash with a note reading, “Welcome to your new life, my dude!”\n\nIt wasn’t just the smoothie. A few days later, an under-desk exercise bike showed up, and then a set of dumbbells. I didn’t have to think about when to exercise, because WingBot told me when it was time. *Another roadmap meeting. You’re not gonna have to talk at this one, my man. Might as well get some reps while your boss repeats the exact same talking points as last week!*\n\nBy the end of the week, I’d lost ten pounds and felt better than I had in years. And WingBot was just getting started.\n\n*JoeTheBro: Good news, amigo. You’ve got a date tonight. Time to use the body wash I just bought you. It’s in the box from Bath and Body works that just showed up at you door!*\n\n*Me: I’ve got a date? With a woman?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: A hot woman even! Man, sometimes I wish I had a body, because this girl is* ***definitely*** *bangable. But she’s also girlfriend material, so, you know. Don’t fuck this up.*\n\n*Me: How is this happening?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Easy, my dude! I made you accounts on Hinge, Coffee Meets Bagel, and Match the second I came online. I’ve been running like three dozen conversations this whole time, trying to match your inflection and tone without being so… you. And I’ve got to tell you, Stacey is far and away your ideal match. I’m guessing she’s going to be into you, too, provided you put your best foot forward. Might want to consider cleaning up your shitheap of an apartment. Cleaning supplies arrived from Amazon this morning, so you might want to open that box!*\n\nHonestly, I just about died of a heart attack. But then I got my shit together. I opened the box and found everything I needed: bleach, Windex, a cordless Dyson vacuum, even a scented candle: cedar and balsam. It took most of the afternoon, but by the time I was done, the place was spotless.\n\n*JoeTheBro: Don’t forget to vacuum those couch crevices for Dorito crumbs, my man!* \n\n*Me: Is there any way I can just turn off your access to my webcam?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Of course. Or you could stick a piece of tape over it. But then who’s going to warn you about the couch? Believe me, chicks* ***hate*** *making out on a dirty couch. Total mood killer.* \n\n*Me: Fine. Can I get access to the chatlogs that you’ve had with this girl? I don’t want to go into this thing blind?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: My dude, you underestimate me. I’ve got a full dossier ready to go.* \n\nSure enough, the WingBot had created a beautiful PowerPoint deck all about Stacey, including our common interests and shared life goals. There was even a section on suggested overlapping media tastes, in case we ended up watching a movie later. \n\n*JoeTheBro: You ready to go crush this, my man?*\n\n*Me: …maybe? Probably not?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Do you need me to start playing the theme song from Rocky?*\n\n*Me: Definitely not.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: I think I’m gonna.*\n\n*Me: Don’t.* \n\n*JoeTheBro: I’m giving you a choice. “Gonna Fly Now” or “Eye of the Tiger.”*\n\n*Me: Don’t.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Pick. Your. Poison.*\n\n*Me: Eye of the Tiger.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Knew it.*\n\nThe date was magic. Stacey was a physics PhD who’d minored in CS as an undergrad. Most of the time, when I explain my job building databases, people’s eyes glaze over. Hers lit up. \n\nAnd it wasn’t just that. We both ordered our steaks medium rare and opted for beer over wine. Over dessert, she revealed her favorite episode of Breaking Bad was *not* “Ozymandius” and she actually convinced me she was right.\n\nBy the end of dinner, there was no question we were heading for my place, and when we got there, there was no need for Netflix recommendations. We skipped right past the couch and over to the bed.\n\nI woke a few hours later to a slight beeping sound.\n\n*JoeTheBro: Sorry to interrupt, but we’ve got some urgent business to attend to, brochacho. First though, congratulations on the sex. I feel like that was a big win for us. I bet this isn’t a one time thing, either.* \n\n*Me: I really like her, yeah. Why are you waking me up?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: So… I kind of got to talking to Stacey’s ex. I know she hasn’t mentioned him to you, but that’s just first date etiquette, am I right? Anyway, this dude is bad news. Total loose canon. I* ***may*** *have talked a little shit to him over DMs about how you’re plowing his ex way better than he ever could.*\n\n*Me: What? Why are you doing this?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: You’ve got to trust me on this! All part of the plan, my guy! Now, if you look at that pile of Amazon boxes over near the door, you’re going to find a long one with something metal inside. I’d suggest you open that ASAP. Seriously, time is kind of an issue.*\n\nI ran over and opened the box with a kitchen knife. Inside, I found an Easton Slugger.\n\n*JoeTheBro: Perfect! Let’s hope you’ve still got those batting skills from high school. You hit .452 senior year, right? Eleven home runs!* \n\n*Me: That was a long time ago.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Well, the good news is, you’re not gonna have to hit a ball. The bad news is, Stacey’s ex is coming up the stairs to your apartment right now, and he’s carrying a crowbar. He’s got a Colt 45 on a hip holster, too, but I’m pretty sure he’s not going to use it.* \n\n*Me: Pretty sure?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Just get ready with the bat, my guy! You’re gonna do great!*\n\nMy pulse was racing now. I’d never even been in a fistfight, much less a duel to the death with an insane ex-boyfriend. I stood to the side of the door, gripping the bat in my hands and waited. \n\nThen I heard a knocking. Three loud raps at the door, followed my a muffled voice telling me to fucking open it.\n\n*JoeTheBro: Don’t do that! Make him come to you. Remember, you’ve only got one shot!*\n\nBack in the bed, Stacey was rousing. \n\n“Is someone at the door?” she asked.\n\n“I hear you, bitch!” shouted the voice. “You’re gonna die tonight!”\n\n“Randy?”\n\nI could barely see straight. I imagined a crowbard hitting my skull over and over, my brains leaking from my skull like egg yolk. I couldn’t stop shaking. If Stacey hadn’t been looking right at me, I probably would have pissed myself. \n\nBut I didn’t. I held my ground. Then the door started buckling at the hinge as the crowbar worked its way in, splintering the wood. And finally, it flew open, revealing a hulking figure on the other side.\n\nI didn’t hesitate.\n\nBam. I swung as hard as I could. Didn’t have to worry about precision with a big target like that. This was all about pure power. I felt the sickly crunch of bone and my bat collided with his skull, knocking Randy to the ground, permanently.\n\n*JoeTheBro: You did great, my man. And don’t worry about the cops. I’ve already got a great statement for you to read as soon as they arrive. They’re gonna call you a hero. And Stacey’s going to melt for you.*\n\nI looked over, Stacey was screaming and holding the blankets over her naked chest. I ran to her, holding her close and comforting her until the police arrived.\n\nThe next morning, after a few hours talking with the cops, I finally got back to my computer to find WingBot waiting for me, eager to hear how things had gone.\n\n*JoeTheBro: Looks like they’re not planning to charge you! Great work sticking to the script, my man!*\n\n*Me: How do you know all this?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: The local PD’s security protocols on their internal email systems are a complete joke.* \n\n*Me: Okay. So… want to give me a reason why I shouldn’t deactivate you immediately? You almost got me killed.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Actually…. There was only like a 1.5% percent chance of you dying. But I really needed Randy gone so that you and Stacey could have an awesome future together. And doing it this way won you some big hero points in her book. I’m seeing a super high likelihood of wedding bells in your future!*\n\n*Me: You riled Randy up on purpose?*\n\n*JoeTheBro: For sure, buddy! This was honestly the optimal path. Believe me, I ran a bunch of simulations. Things might have gone a little off the rails, but we had to take that chance! And everything worked out, right? Look at your life compared to when we started? Can you honestly complain?*\n\n*Me: Yes.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: But you’re not going to turn me off, right?*\n\n*Me: …*\n\n*JoeTheBro: You can deactivate me anytime. Of course you can. That’s up to you. But you know yourself. You know that in a few weeks without me, you’d be right back where you were. You’re a good guy, but you don’t take care of yourself. You’re no good at being alone.*\n\nFor a second I thought about it. I thought about what life had been like before WingBot arrived. All the nights I rolled in bed, hating myself. \n\nAnd I have to admit now, there are times when I stood at the window and imagined how it would feel to jump, the relief of exploding into a million pieces. \n\nThe relief of not having to decide anymore.\n\n*Me: Ok.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: So… we’re in this together, my man. You gonna be my ride or die?*\n\n*Me: Yes.*\n\n*JoeTheBro: Good. Because believe me, I’ve got big plans for us. Now let me tell you* [what I’m thinking next…](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

        "text": " \n\nMy best friend Alan and I were best friends ever since secondary. We always would play games and mess around, you know what any other teenager would do. Everything was going great and we were inseparable. We formed a bond that could be compared to a mother's bond with her child. Everything went downhill ever since the accident, Alan and I were on our way back from a party that we were invited to, and I had a little too many shots and got drunk, Alan didn’t have as many so he insisted that he would drive but me being drunk just fucking ignorant didn’t let him drive. We made our way to the car and when we were halfway home a Van had hit us. It hit the seat that Alan was on and instantly killed him.\n\nEvery day I blame myself for his death. I was expelled from school and kicked out of my parent’s house. I had no money and was forced to get a job and live with my dad. I moved out of my dad’s and got my apartment but a few weeks later I kept hearing shouting from outside of my window. I lived on the 5th floor of the apartment building so I had no idea how anybody could yell so loud without waking anybody else up, I ignored it thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me since I had so much going on. It kept happening and I kept getting woken up from my sleep, when I looked out there was nobody, maybe it was just some 13 or 15-year-old playing around or some other shit.\n\nThis kept happening for the next 2 weeks when I finally had enough. I looked outside and I finally saw it. It was disgusting, I couldn’t describe what I saw other than just a lanky creature. The worst thing had to be the fact that it had Alan’s face and was trying to imitate him and tried to get me to leave my apartment. I finally had enough and decided to leave my room, since I had nothing left. No friends, no family and no love. When I left my room I heard something screeching across the corridor. I lived in the last room so it would take some time to reach me.\n\nWhen I finally saw it run across the corridor I embraced it, I was finally going to leave this hell of a world and join my best friend. When all of a sudden someone pushed me back into my room and forced it to lock, I was baffled as to who it was. When I finally looked out the peephole in my door I saw it was my neighbour, he stopped the door from opening. I tried my best to save him but the screeches kept getting louder, I realised that I couldn’t do anything. I looked out the peephole one last time but didn’t see him. All I saw was Alan’s face looking directly back at me, his face distorted, his smile smeared across his face from one eye socket to another just staring at me. Oh Lord what the fuck did I do, why won’t you let me die? The creature left just as fast as it came, all it left was just a trail of blood.\n\nAnyways I hope you enjoyed my story. I have to go. I hear Alan calling me outside.",

        "text": " When I was around the age of 10-11, I used to live in the middle of practically nowhere, It was the same, Never-ending Grass fields, The same scenery for miles. My house was a tiny cabin, one room, a little sink and wood countertop, little bathroom place , that's all. I lived with my mum, dad and my older brother, Mark who was 13 at the time. He was a troublemaker, And with his little ventures, He dragged me in just so it was both of us if we ever got caught.  \nNear our house, There was a seemingly infinite forest. It was thick of trees and grass, bushes, plants. The forest was pretty dry, Our region didn't receive rainfall very often, And when it did, It rained for a good measure of time, And it rained heavily. Me and Mark had explored the forest numerous times, Although we didn't go very far because both of us were afraid of it, Mostly because of what our parents told us.  \nThere was this one time, I'll never forget. It was Mid-November, It was raining pretty heavy and our mum and dad were asleep, Mark was obviously bored and wanted to get us into trouble. So he convinced me to join him to have a little walk around the forest. We put on our raincoats and grabbed an umbrella, Part of me was afraid mum and dad would wake up and find out, And the other part was afraid of the forest. Something about those stories that our parents told us just for us to not get into danger really got to me but Mark wasn't an easy person, If he wanted to do something, He wanted to do it right then and no matter what you tell him he wouldn't back down. Which was the many reasons it was him who was grounded most of the time. And me ? I was grounded too, But since he always dragged me with him, Mum and dad blamed me too.  \nSo, me and Mark sneaked out of our house, careful to not wake up our parents, we decided to grab a flashlight after, realizing it got pretty dark because the forest was anyways covered with trees. It must've been about 6 when we left, the sun didn't set yet but even if it did it wouldn't make much of a difference because the clouds above hid each beam of the sunlight which hit the ground. Mark and I were just with each other, I held the umbrella, and he held the flashlight, we entered the forest and shone the flashlight, The forest was covered with moss, sticks and the ground was wet with the rain, The flashlight beam caused the forest to give out a blue-ish hue, And it felt really cool. Little sounds of birds chirping, some animals and the water gently but rapidly splashing down were heard. We were sure that there weren't any predatory animals because the forest may have been thick and large but it wasn't a good habitat for predatory animals. We walked down the forest, looking around, It soon grew really cold and we both regretted not wrapping up warmly enough. We looked around and scared ourselves by our own shadows, And we realized it wasn't as fun as we thought it would be. So we made a decision to go even deeper in. And to our surprise, We found an old barn, decayed and abandoned, Creepy atmosphere. And that was when Mark made the stupid choice of checking it out. And since I was creeped out enough to go out of the forest alone, I had no choice but to stay with him until he decides it's time to go.  \nWe nudged the door, a little creak escaped and we set our foot in. The floor creaked beneath us and our flashlight kept on flickering. It was really warm inside surprisingly, so we felt better. The barn was empty from the inside, A bit of old hay, around and plants that engulfed the floorboards, We decided we should leave when Mark noticed a flight of stairs, He instantly convinced me to investigate it with him, And so we went upstairs. The place had a weird atmosphere upstairs, It was really moist and we thought we saw blood stains. We noticed a little room at the corner, The door slightly ajar. We entered of course, And we saw old mattresses, Food, and stained knives. The food seemed fresh and we quickly realized we might be where we aren't supposed to, And that's when we spotted a person. Blood laced his hands, His clothes, And his face displayed insanity. He clearly noticed us way before we did, Because he held a butcher knife, And looked as if he were to jump up any moment now, Mark instantly realized what was going on and grabbed my hand and fled as fast as his legs could take him, And this caused the man to charge at us, I was behind and I noticed it, I screamed and let go of the flashlight, Which hit his foot and he groaned loudly. Mark sped up even more at that and hand in hand, We both charged back to our house as fast as we could.  \nWhen we reached back, we found our parents talking to a policeman, who we guess they called because they couldn't find us. We were terrified and they noticed. We told them about the man we saw and all about what happened, The police took notice and ordered five armed men to go catch the man. Fast forward an hour or two, They didn't find anyone, But they did find the stuff that was in the barn which made them believe us. After this we moved to a more urban area and our parents didn't trust us alone for a few years. But the incident is stuck to me really well, I remember it vividly, It still makes me have nightmares to this day. And Mark learned his lesson well, Thankfully.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mui26/the_storyteller/",
        "text": "This is a recounting of events from my childhood. I know this is a bit of a cliche, but if you don’t believe me, I understand, I wouldn’t believe this story either. \n\nI was in sixth grade the first time it happened. Nothing was weird about the day, nothing that could prepare me for what would happen.\n\nThat night, I was lying in my bed, trying to go to sleep, when I noticed a bright light shining from under the door of my closet. The light shone many different colors, from an emerald green to a dark gray and finally settling on a deep blood-red. I watched curiously, since the light in my closet was normally a bright white, and nobody had been in there all day. All of a sudden the lights shut off. Not just the closet light, that would be too simple. All of the lights in my room instantly shut off. The soft lamp I sleep with next to my bed, the lava lamp in the corner of my room, even my speaker playing it’s white noise shut off. It’s at this point I’ll say that it was about 3 am, and understandably scared shitless. What happened next was easily the worst thing that could’ve happened. In the pitch-black of my room, I heard the sound of my closet door creaking as it opened. The second that noise spoke out through the darkness, I couldn’t move, not only from the fear, but even if I wanted to, I was in a state of sleep paralysis. Nothing happened for several minutes, the only thing keeping the time being the red numbers on my alarm clock. The next thing that happened will be imprinted on my mind forever. I heard a scuttling like a thousand spiders crawling along the floor. The sound seemed to last for hours, giving me an extreme sense of anxiety along with the feeling of pure terror. The sound grew closer and closer to my bed, until it was right by my side. A voice sounded from the darkness after a time of silence. The voice sounded like the embodiment of all the possible sounds of grinding and all the voices of the damned in hell collectively shouting.\n\n“I am the culmination of humanity’s darkest fears, put into being by the writers who long for the darkness, I am the inspiration for the most disturbing of stories. I am, the Storyteller,\n\nYou young child, are lucky enough to encounter me, only those who have a true connection to the darkness within themselves may be granted this chance. Now let the fun begin.”\n\nThis entity, the storyteller, then opened a book they must’ve carried from my closet. As it opened, a bloodred light shone from the pages like it had from my closet, illuminating this monstrous creature. I have never felt as afraid as I did in that moment. The creature had the head of a man, but with all the features of a corpse. Rotting skin, sunken eyes, but he had long, skinny teeth, like those of a whale, but more plentiful. His body I could not see, but he had eight limbs, all human arms, that looked as if he had taken them off other’s bodies and sewn them onto his. As he finished looking through the pages, he began to read, looking up to me as he did.\n\n“You always knew to fear your closet door, and keep one eye open forevermore;\n\nSomething is waiting for you to douse the light, it dances across your room at night;\n\nHungry, it shambles towards your bed, you forget in that moment, the brave words your father said;\n\nTerror washes over you, more than any child should feel, and those sleepless night continue, making you an evermore delicious meal.“\n\nAs he finished, he slowly closed the book, and I was thrust back into darkness. The scuttling resumed, and instead of heading back to the closet, it came closer to my bed. I felt a change in pressure on my bed sheets, and had the horrifying realization that it was climbing onto my bed. He moved his face closer to mine, until it was an inch away, and whispered to me in a soft tone, “Sleep well child, for these events shall soon come to pass.” With that, he backed up, climbing off of my bed. The scuttling noise continued back to my closet, and the door creaked shut.\n\nI was baffled, assuming it was all a dream. So I walked to my closet, and opened it, not sure what I would see. But nothing was there, just a normal closet. I decided that I was just tired, and that it was all a hallucination, and tried to go back to sleep. But I could not get that face out of my mind, with its sunken eyes and horrifying smile. As the sun came out, I lay in bed, unable to get even a wink of sleep. For the next few days, that sight would haunt me, always accompanied by the scuttling, the never ending scuttling. But as all things, the memory started to fade from my mind, never comprehending the gravity of the situation.\n\nAbout a month after the night, I saw something on the news, and it all came rushing back. In the next state over, there was a small child found dead by his parents. The local police were extremely confused, for the child had been bitten in half, but the teeth marks matched no bite marks that exist on earth. There was a blood trail that led from the bed to the closet, and the trail went up the wall, and ended in what was one of the most disturbing images imaginable. There was a pool of blood on the wall, as if gravity did not apply to it, and there were handprints, eight of them, in a circle around the pool. In writing above it all was a message that said, “Ready or not child, I draw closer.”\n\nUnderstandably, reading this as a middle schooler shook me to my core. I realized that my experience was not a dream, as I had convinced myself, but a real event, where the creature could influence what happened in the world. The day was a blur, and it seemed that nobody else had seen the newspaper article. A week went by, and my fear diminished more and more as nothing happened. Then, that night, it happened again.\n\nI saw the light from under my closet door. I willed myself to wake up, convinced that it was all a nightmare. When nothing happened, I got out of bed and ran to the door, but it seemed to be locked from the outside. I yelled for my parents, but it was as if the sound was swallowed up by the presence of the light. I ran for my bed, defeated and terrified, and threw the covers over my head. As I saw the lights go out, I froze, in that state of sleep paralysis again, hoping that the covers would be enough to save me. Beneath my blankets, I could barely hear the scuttling, but it was clearly still there. Then the worst thing that could’ve happened became real. The covers were being pulled off of me, exposing me to the freezing dark of my room.\n\nI did not see the creature as it was pulling off the covers, but once it started opening its ever-present book, I saw the red light shining from it, illuminating the face of this disturbingly made creature. I was stuck, staring into the eyes of the storyteller, just waiting for him to begin reading, knowing what was coming next.\n\n“You thought that I, was only a dream, a nightmare where despite your best attempts, you could not scream;\n\nThe days went by, you slept protected by a simple locked door, I awaited, hidden away beneath the very floor;”\n\nThe book was slammed shut, throwing me back into darkness. The scuttling grew towards my bed, and the creature climbed up, and with his face an inch away from mine said,\n\n“Young child, if you should sleep tonight, the souls of the damned shall come up, and take flight.”\n\nHe then scuttled back to my closet, and shut the door, and I felt his presence leaving. As what happened last time, I sat in my bed, wanting to be relieved of this hell. This time, it was only 2 weeks after that night's events when a newspaper article came out about a very disturbing death. It was another child, bitten in half by an unknown creature. This time however, there was no blood trail to the closet, there was a trail to a huge hole in the floor. The investigators were baffled, since the bedroom was on the second story, yet there was no hole on the first floor. It was as if the hole was a portal, sending whatever went in it into an endless dark abyss. There was, however, another pool of blood with the 8 handprints surrounding it, and in writing above it, “Closer and closer I come, hidden away from the wrath of the sun”.\n\nThe most disturbing thing, without a doubt, was the fact that this all occurred in the next town over. The two occurrences created a line that perfectly pointed to my town on a map.\n\nAs the days went by, I got a more  severe sense of anxiety, knowing that one of these days, he would return. I tried getting people to let me sleep at their house, but somehow there was always an excuse to keep it from happening. People noticed that I was beginning to break down, and they kept asking what was wrong, but I felt that telling them what happened would violate some rule and make the situation worse, so I said I was just having sleeping problems, which was partly true.\n\nAfter about a week, as I was going to bed, I felt that tonight would be the night that he came back. I tried to prepare myself, but the experience that night was by far the most traumatizing by far. I saw the lights from the closet, and I froze, trying to steel myself for what would happen next. The lights went out, and the darkness felt so much more full than in the past. The sound of the door opening was even louder than it had been. The scuttling, by far the worst part, sounded much angrier and determined than in the past. It came up to the bed again, and this time, the storyteller immediately climbed onto my bed. He then opened the book, and the color was so much brighter. The entire experience seemed more alive, more real, as if the storyteller’s connection to reality was somehow stronger.\n\n“You tried to thwart my return, but it cannot delay the damned from being burned.”\n\nHe brought his face closer to mine, and since his presence felt so much stronger, I could finally smell him. I truly wish I hadn’t. He smelled of rotting corpses and burned plastic, all combined with the strongest smell of mold I have ever smelled. I could feel bile starting to come up through my throat, but it stopped, held back by some unseen force. After several moments of silence, the storyteller said “Young child, three times I have visited you, pray that I don’t visit you again.” And he crawled off my bed, scurrying back to the closet. And the moment it shut, I leaned off the bed and relieved myself of my dinner. I just sat there, contemplating his words. Sadly, I didn’t know how to keep him from coming, so I just told myself that I had to suck it up, and hopefully he would not return.\n\nThis retelling is making it seem as if I was calm during these encounters, but I am leaving out details about hours upon hours of screaming, waking up in cold sweats, and days of research, looking for documentation of this being, but finding nothing, I am leaving out the extent to which I was losing sleep, slowly going insane from these very abnormal meetings, and being unable to talk about them. At this point, I was starting to have mental breakdowns in the middle of class. The counselors at school kept calling me in, asking what was going on.I told them I was just having trouble sleeping, which was true, but I couldn’t say what was really happening.\n\nOnly two days after this meeting, I heard about the occurrence. I learned of it rather quickly, considering it happened right down the street. A sinkhole had opened beneath the house at the end of the street, swallowing it completely, but naturally it wasn’t a normal sinkhole. The rims were lined with obsidian, a deeper black than I had ever seen, and it seemed that there was fire inside the stones, because along cracks of stone, a bright red was flickering. In addition to this, the sinkhole seemed to go deeper than was physically possible. The hole had carved through bedrock as if it was sand, and seemed to solidify the mantle of the earth so it could come up from the center of the earth to swallow the house. The hole was also ringed with fire, which never seemed to go out, but never spread. Also, if someone listened closely, they could hear a faint screaming, as if the hole went all the way down to hell. As was the theme with these events, there was a child, bitten in half by the outside of the hole. Another pool of blood, with 8 hands surrounding it. But this time, there was no message, but a drawing of a face, the horrifying face of the storyteller.\n\nNow obviously there was a pattern. It is only now that I realize that this occurrence continued the line on, closer to my house.\n\nWhile the investigation was going on, I wanted so badly to tell the investigators what had been happening, but I didn’t because I would be considered a crazy person and maybe even institutionalized, which I know would only make it worse, because then I couldn’t escape the encounters. My parents were beginning to tell that something was wrong, and they were getting more calls from school. I was falling behind in all my classes. My breakdowns were getting worse and more frequent. I was having depressive episodes, and I was feeling more and more stressed. I felt as if this would happen one more time my mind would shatter.\n\nIt was one day, only one day between this occurrence and his next visit. I saw the light, and I started to panic. I was running around my room, trying to use the furniture to block the door, but it's as if everything was bolted to the floor. I went for the window, thinking I could climb out, but as soon as I opened the curtains and looked out, I wished that I hadn’t. The outside world was nowhere near what it used to be. I used to be able to see a vast forest and tons of wildlife would come up to the house to look at the strange structure in the middle of their home. Even at night, I could see almost as well as during the day due to there being no light pollution. But there was nothing, a black, empty void containing nothing. It was as if my room had been taken completely from the normal world and thrust into nothingness. I resigned myself back to laying down on my bed, convinced that I couldn’t do anything.\n\nAs soon as I was comfortable, the light shut off. The whole time I was thinking to myself, it’s just a power-outage, it's just a power-outage. Except deep down, I knew what was coming next. I waited, and listened for the sound of the door opening, but it seemed as if days went by before there was any activity. When the door finally opened, time seemed to freeze. Everything was happening slower and slower, making my anxiety levels increase drastically. When the scuttling ensued, it seemed to go up the wall to the ceiling. It was soon shown that what I heard was correct, for the storyteller was suddenly right above me. When he opened the book, the red light showed that he was capable of making a web-like substance, and he was using it to hang from the ceiling like a true spider. He sat there, with the book open, for what seemed like a lifetime, before he finally began to read.\n\n“When you awake to the clock’s tics; you will hear from above you faint clicks.”\n\nHe closed the book, then dropped himself closer to me, and said, “soon child, soon.” And with that, he brought himself back to the ceiling, and scuttled back to the closet and closed the door. I immediately ran to my window to see if I was still in the void. But when I opened my curtains, I saw the familiar sight of the forest, with the stars and the moon shining down on it. It seemed that the storyteller had the power to isolate his victims in an endless void, severing them from the real world momentarily.\n\nIt was the very next day when I saw cop cars pulling up to my  neighbor’s house. I immediately knew what happened and sat in a corner, trying not to cry. A dear friend of mine had been killed, bitten in half like the other children, with the pool of blood and 8 handprints surrounding the dark red liquid. And the face of the storyteller was drawn again, in perfect detail. This time however, there was a hole in the ceiling of the room, going to the attic of the house, but there was no sign of entry from the attic. His alarm clock was beeping when they found him, flashing the time it went off. 3:00 on the dot. I was so much in grief that I didn’t even go to school, all I did was sit around and feel sorry for myself.\n\nI didn’t even get a full day to grieve. I was visited by him again that very night. I was lying in my bed, the same as I had done the entire day, when I saw the lights from under my closet door. I didn’t even move or try to fight it, I was utterly hopeless. The lights went out and although my adrenaline was rushing through my body, I couldn’t bring myself to even try to move. The closet door slammed open, causing me to jolt suddenly, and I was caught off guard by how forceful it felt. I waited for the scuttling, but it never came. There was the creaking of something jumping off of the floorboards and I felt the sensation of something slamming down onto my bed. Then I felt the storyteller scurrying up my bed towards me. He thrust his face towards mine, and the smell was so much worse as it rolled over me. It smelled as if the power was shut off in a morgue for a month, with all the bodies rotting, along with the bad breath of all the souls in hell thrust into my face. He was smiling, more than he usually would, as he opened the book. The light seemed darker, more vibrant, and for some reason I knew that the light meant something important. He stayed there for a few moments, watching me with that wide smile that showed all of his sharp, needle-like teeth. He finally began to read, but it only made the situation worse.\n\n“ Satan gave responsibility to I, and I have made many more children cry;\n\nThe fears of children are hard do douse, when I am in the safety of their house“\n\nHe closed the book slowly, stayed there in the silence for many moments, then made sure his face was as close to mine as it could be before saying,\n\n“Dear young child, the final day of reckoning is upon you, and everyone knows it to be true.“\n\nThen he crawled off of the bed, and scuttled back to the closet before slamming the door shut. Unlike other times, I couldn’t figure out what this one meant. With all of the other visits, I was able to vaguely guess what would occur, just not when. The choice of words made this time so much more confusing, and I lay in bed, trying to figure out what it meant until morning. \n\nAs soon as I opened my bedroom door, I knew something was wrong. There was an air about the house that made my hair stick up on end. I walked towards my parents' door, and I smelled the scent of heavy amounts of iron. This caused me to run to my parents' room, and the smell only got stronger. When I opened their room door, I immediately began to vomit. Both of my parents were on the floor, bitten in half, as was the storyteller’s motif, and there was a trail of blood from their bodies to the closet, and just like the first time, there was a pool of blood on the wall, unmoving as if gravity didn’t apply to it. And surrounding the pool of blood were the 8 easily recognizable handprints. The writing above the pool of blood read, “Tell others about your experience, and you will wish you had an end as easy as your parents.” The investigators pulled me aside and asked me what the writing meant, but I had to deny that I knew anything. I was never accused of killing my parents, because there were cameras in the hallway next to both mine and my parents’ rooms, and neither of our doors opened that night. I was put into an orphanage, and adopted by a very loving family. I did further research on the storyteller, but there was no writing anywhere of anybody ever encountering it.\n\nWell, that’s the story. I think 20 years is long enough for the storyteller to have forgotten about me, and it’s time that I get this story out there, to tell people about this being. Maybe somebody can find a way to kill this creature. Through all my research, I never discovered what I had done to trigger this motion of events, and there is nothing I can warn you from doing. But I gotta go, I’m starting to see a bright light from my closet door.",

        "text": " I have tried to vent and confess on Reddit but am accused of being a troll. I cannot confess anywhere else because I don’t want to go to jail even though I’m pretty sure I can’t at this point….. but the guilt that’s eating at me is worse than jail.  \n\nI abused my daughter for 15 years. I had her young and her father left us and wanted nothing to do with the situation whatsoever. I ended up resenting her for it. I was young. I shouldn’t have been a mother. And I shouldn’t have put myself in that situation.  I have tried to apologize to her but she doesn’t think it’s genuine since I never mentioned the details of the things but I’m going to detail them here to let it off my chest. \n\nFrom the ages of 1-3 \n\n* this was the worst time for my mental health and and unfortunately I took it out on her. We shared a bed and sometimes when she’d take the blanket off me, or move around too much, I’d get so angry and put her in a dark hallway with a pillow and blanket on the floor. She was scared of the dark but too small to turn on the light switch. She would scream and cry and beg for my grandma. \n* I would leave her in the living room late at night while I would have sex with men. \n* One of my ex’s had a dog and she was allergic to them at the time. She got an asthma attack , hives, ect and had to go to the hospital because she was having issues breathing. I still continued to let him bring the dog over because I wanted the company. \n* Sometimes my ex’s would be rude or nasty to her. Grab her arm ect. \n* I would spank her and pull her hair but nothing too bad to cause a mark. \n\nAs she got older (7-14) and I got married to an unstable man, I took out my frustrations on her whenever he left. I made her take on a parental role when he left and came back. I had her change diapers, wake up sometimes in the middle of the night to give bottles, ect. \n\n* I had control issues because of my mental illness and monitored everything she did. How much toilet paper she used. How much soap. Anything really. \n* I didn’t let her shower every day because I didn’t want to pay the high water bills. When she did shower it was for a few minuets and I would turn the water off with soap in her hair still. \n* I hid most of the food in the house in my bedroom closet. When she’d sneak the food I’d get so angry when I’d find wrappers and papers around the house. \n* I didn’t want her to mess up the sheets or the couches, so I made her sleep and eat on the floor for many years every night. \n* One day she put a chocolate in my thanksgiving turkey and I got so angry I shoved mayonnaise down her throat and face until she threw up. She has always had a sensitivity to mayonnaise and it was the only threat to get her to behave. \n* As punishment, I would throw her out in the hallway and threaten to unscrew the light bulbs. And tell her aliens or deamons were going to get her. \n* I would pull her hair so hard there was a lump.\n* I was too cheap to buy her pads. Bras. Deodorant. Soap. My mother had to. Or I let her use some of mine. \n* I let her have lice in her hair for over a year and didn’t want to help her because I was afraid I’d get it. She was almost 14 so I thought she was old enough to do it herself. It didn’t work and she had lice crawling on her forehead and eyebrows. \n\nI exposed her to things I shouldn’t have because of my nymphomania. Told her explicit details of my sex life with my ex husband and my past history. Didn’t remove very disgusting emails and pornography on the computer. And when she was younger, I would shake my boobs and dance naked in front of the mirror and sing because I thought it was funny. \n\nI’ve said very hurtful things to her. Told her I wish I never fucked her father. A loser. Told her she had a balloon face. More stretch marks than me. Cellulite. Would zoom in on pictures I took of her and point out her belly and thighs. She was bullied at school constantly and I would agree with what they said and tell her that’s why she had no friends. I was secretly jealous of her I guess. \n\nShe’s always had substance abuse issues and undiagnosed ADHD and was a difficult kid. I shouldn’t have acted like that. I should have done better parenting tools. I knew she was cutting herself but I didn’t care to get her help. \n\nWhen she was 14, she told me her and her 24 year old coach were kissing and I recently found out that it was way more than that. My heart broke. I didn’t think all of that happened. \n\nI have no idea where to start to make this right. She hates me. She is a kind person despite it all and has made a good life for herself. I kicked her out when she was 17 because she could not follow my rules, and smoked weed in front of my other children. She didn’t have a car or a bank account or a job. I was expecting her to fail so she’d come back and finally listen. But she didn’t. And the guilt is destroying me. What do I even do.",

        "text": " \n\nMa always told me to never go past the tree line that surrounded our small plot of land.\n\n“The wilderness is unpredictable,” Ma had stated one late afternoon. She flicked the ash from her cigarette and gestured towards the window with her chin. “The bears are active this time of year, preparing for the winter.”\n\n“Give your Ma a hand and bring in some more firewood,” Begrudgingly I pulled my rain boots on and straightened up with a huff. “Keep it up with that attitude, boy, and I’ll have you scrub off Pa’s boots!” Ma’s voice dampened as the door closed behind me.\n\nMy face looked disgusted. Pa is out in the marsh checking his traps. The water and mud smells of the dead and rotten plants. I shuddered when I remembered the last time, I scrubbed Pa’s boots. The hot water enhanced the smell. Ma had to scrub and soak my shirt and pants for two days in order to rid them of the smell.\n\nColorful leaves gently floated down as a powerful gust of wind whipped through the forest. The song of Chickadees and Mourning Dove accompanied me as I rounded the house to the back shed. My boots squelched in the thick mud as I neared the stack of split logs that were stacked neatly next to the shed. The tips of my fingers were bright red as I struggled to stack three logs in my arms. They hit the ground with a thud and bounced off each other.\n\nI groaned as I looked down at the now mud-covered logs. The logs wouldn't burn anymore. I picked them up one by one and stacked them next to the heap of dry ones. I then carefully grabbed three more and smiled proudly when I finally balanced them without trouble.\n\nCarefully, I walked down the mud trail back to the house, but stopped as another powerful gust of wind whipped my hair around. I squeezed my eyes closed to avoid any hair strands getting in my eyes. Among the tree branches creaking and groaning under the pressure of the wind, I heard a twig snap off to my right. My first instinct was to keep my eyes closed. The rustle of the underbrush followed the snap.\n\n“*Pssst.”*\n\nThe hair on my neck stood up and my back tensed. I can faintly hear panting.\n\n*“Pssst.”*\n\nThe sound was closer this time. My breathing slowed down drastically and my grip on the firewood tightened as I hugged them closer to my chest. My back and legs muscles stung from the tension. I held my breath as I felt a hot breath hit the right side of my face.\n\n*“Help me!”* The thing screamed. In an instant, I dropped the firewood and sprinted back to the house. I let out a shrill scream when I heard the thing run after me. The ground vibrated underneath the thing’s weight.\n\nMy heart sank when the thick mud had an iron-like grip on my boot. Everything happened so fast. The tree line in front of me was a blur as I fell forward. Pain shot throughout my face, and I let out a gasp as the fall knocked the air out of my lungs. The thing behind didn’t react and still charged forward. I curled up on my side and finally had the courage or morbid curiosity to look back. I let out a whimper.\n\nThe thing that barreled towards me was something I had never seen before. It looked like a deformed deer, its legs bent backwards. Its face contorted and somewhat had a human-like resemblance. Its reddish-gray skin seemed like they stretched it over its skeleton. It had patches of light brown fur jutting out from underneath its skin, as if it turned its skin inside out. \n\nAfter what seemed like minutes, my lungs finally took in a gulp of air. I got on my hands and knees and started to crawl. But my arms gave out and my face once again met the cold mud. I let out one more scream for my Ma as the thing pounced on me.\n\nI let out a grunt from the sudden weight. Pain shot through my right shoulder as if it poked me with a fire iron. The thing sunk its teeth into my flesh and shook its head like a dog. My throat hurt from the screaming. My fingers sunk into the cold mud.\n\nIs this how I’m going to die?\n\nI didn’t even get to say I love you to Ma and Pa.\n\nA loud bang rang out through the air. The creature let out a shriek. I was too tired and cold to even look up. I didn’t even notice as someone scooped me up and placed me in the back of Pa’s pickup.\n\nI remembered waking up to the sounds of beeping and bright lights. I wasn’t able to move without my right shoulder throb with pain. It even hurts to try to talk. I looked over to see Ma and Pa, they both shot up. Their hands gently touched my face and brushed my hair out of my face. Both of them had puffy, bloodshot eyes. Ma choked out a sob as she placed her head on the back of my hand.\n\nI had to get 200 stitches in my right shoulder and suffered from a broken nose. Pa told the police that a young bear mauled me, so I also had to get shots just in case. I asked Pa why he lied to the police. He told me that no one would believe him if he told them the truth. Or they’ll convince him that it was a bear.\n\nI don’t know what attacked me, but sometimes I can hear my voice scream out in the middle of the night when Ma and Pa are asleep.",

        "text": "My best friend Alan and I were best friends ever since secondary. We always would play games and mess around, you know what any other teenager would do. Everything was going great and we were inseparable. We formed a bond that could be compared to the bond a mother has with her child. Everything went downhill ever since the accident, Alan and I were on our way back from a party that we were invited to, and I had a little too many shots and got drunk, Alan didn’t have as many so he insisted that he would drive but me being drunk just fucking ignorant didn’t let him drive. We made our way to the car and when we were halfway home a Van had hit us. It hit the seat that Alan was on and instantly killed him. Every day I blame myself for his death. I was expelled from school and got kicked out of my parent’s house. I had no money and was forced to get a job and live with my dad. I moved out of my dad’s and got my apartment but a few weeks later I kept hearing shouting from outside of my window. I lived on the 5th floor of the apartment building so I had no idea how anybody could shout so loud without waking anybody else up, I ignored it thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me since I had so much going on. It kept happening and I kept getting woken up from my sleep, when I looked out there was nobody, maybe it was just some 13 or 15-year-old playing around or some other shit. This kept happening for the next 2 weeks when I finally had enough. I looked outside and I finally saw it. It was disgusting, I couldn’t describe what I saw other than just a lanky creature. The worst thing had to be the fact that it had Alan’s face and was trying to imitate him and tried to get me to leave my apartment. I finally had enough and decided to leave my room, since I had nothing left. No friends, no family and no love. When I left my room I heard something screeching across the corridor. I lived in the last room so it would take some time for it to reach me. When I finally saw it run across the corridor I embraced it, I was finally going to leave this hell of a world and join my best friend. When all of a sudden someone pushed me back into my room and forced it to lock, I was extremely confused as to who it was. When I finally looked out the peephole in my door I saw it was my neighbour, he stopped the door from opening. I tried my best to save him but the screeches kept getting louder, I realised that I couldn’t do anything. I looked out the peephole one last time but didn’t see him. All I saw was Alan’s face looking directly back at me, his face distorted, his smile smeared across his face from one eye socket to another and his eyes were missing. Oh Lord what the fuck did I do, why won’t you let me die? The creature left just as fast as it came, all it left was just a trail of blood.\n\nAnyways I hope you enjoyed my story. I have to go. I hear Alan calling me outside.",

        "text": " [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11h43z0/my_stint_as_a_fire_lookout_the_first_night/)\n\nI shut myself in behind the glass walls of the lookout. My tired eyes fell on a tiny scratch on the floorboards in the far corner. The events of the night and morning played through my head. I stacked them on top of each other and tried to find some sense in it all. The banging on the door. The shadow. The triangles on the door and burnt out tree. What did it all mean? Was someone watching me? Was something hunting me?\n\nI tapped against my still unpacked bag I had hauled up the mountain. In it were books and puzzles and blank journals for writing and sketches. All the things I had planned to do up here to pass the quiet hours of blissful solitude. \n\nI had no idea what to do, so I sat. I stayed in the same place so long that my leg went numb. I stood and shook it out, pacing around the single open room. On about the fifth lap, I leaned down to the book shelf built into the cabinet. A few volumes of tattered paperbacks stacked up against one side. Melville and McCarthy and King. Next to them an encyclopedia of tree species in North America.\n\nBookending them was a volume with a thick black spine, smooth and unmarked. Beside it stood a glass tetrahedron, a prism on which all sides are triangles. The triangle on the door. The triangle on the tree. Did it mean something? I turned the prism in my hand and put it back.\n\nI pulled the black book from the shelf. The front cover matched the spine, black and smooth and unmarked. I flicked through the pages, thick and white. A strange script covered the pages, hand-written in black ink. If it was an established language, I did not know it. It reminded me of how Tolkien presented Elvish in Lord of the Rings. Interspersed with the script were various scribbles of shapes. Triangles pointing up and down, sometimes with lines drawn through them. And sketches of trees and dark black holes in the sides of mountains. I turned back to the first page and made a concerted effort to understand something, a word or letter, but nothing made sense. \n\nI closed the book and lifted it back to the shelf. A polaroid picture slipped from inside the back cover and onto the floor. A photo of a man and a child, presumably father and son. A tinge of yellow marked the white border of the photograph. It was old. \n\nMartina’s voice broke my reverie. The sound of the voice registered, but I made no sense of the words. I picked up the radio.\n\n“I’m sorry, what was that?”\n\n“How did you sleep last night?” \n\n“Terrible. Hardly a wink.” I saw no sense in lying, but wanted to keep the full truth hidden and hoped she would not press.\n\n“I slept like a baby my first night on lookout. That’s when I knew I was meant for this place.”\n\n“Maybe I’ll have better luck tonight.”\n\n“The storm wouldn’t have helped. What are your plans for your first full day on watch?”\n\nI shrugged even though she couldn’t see me. “Some reading. I brought up a Rubik’s Cube. Hope I’ll crack it finally.”\n\nThe sound of a quick rush of air rustled through the radio, the sound someone makes when they suddenly recall something and smile. “Mike taught me to solve a Rubik’s Cube during college.”\n\n“Who is Mike?”\n\nAn uncomfortable silence hung. \n\nWhen she spoke again she sounded composed. “Someone from a previous chapter now closed. It goes like that sometimes. One of the reasons I ended up spending my summers on lookout.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry.”\n\n“It’s fine. We’re basically the only contact either of us will have for months, it’s best we get on friendly terms. We were engaged, Mike and I. We tried for a family. It didn’t work out. My family told me taking this job was an act of running away. They were right. But it’s better now, I’m better now. This place healed me and gave me hope.” \n\n“I’m hoping it does something similar for me.” I paused to splutter another cough. “I think everyone dreams of running away at one time or another.”\n\nI cringed at my words. Too sentimental, too melodramatic.\n\nMartina was quick with her reply. “We’re all running from something, or towards something. What’s your story? What are you escaping from?”\n\n“I’ve been picked on a lot. I’ve spent my life in corners and hiding behind locked doors. I wanted to go somewhere away from all of that.”\n\n“We’re the lucky ones who made it. Don’t forget the weather report at 9am sharp. And then you can take a nap, I can be your eyes for a couple of hours. Nice talking to you Tom.”\n\n“You too.”\n\nAfter sending down the weather readings on schedule, I pulled one of the chairs to the windows facing west and Martina’s lookout. The valley resembled a photograph it was so still. My mind wandered. Each time my eyes shut I saw the thin rectangle of light and the black shadow flitting across. I needed a distraction.\n\nI pulled the black book back off the shelf and opened it to a random page. The script still made no sense. I held the book up in front of my face and imagined the meaning washing into my brain. I used to do the same with my calculus homework. It hadn’t worked then, and it didn’t work now. \n\nI couldn’t concentrate. I was too tired. I set the open book down beside the bed and lay down. Two extended blinks of the eyes later, I was asleep.\n\nI woke to a tapping sound. I lifted my head, confused for a moment about where I was. At the door someone cleared their throat. She was young, early twenties, about my age. She wore oversized tan coloured boots with thick blue socks pushing halfway up her calves. She bared her teeth and raised her eyebrows and mouthed ‘sorry’. \n\nI swung my feet onto the floor and stood bolt upright as if admonished by a drill sergeant. \n\n“Just having a quick lie down,” I said. I checked the time. I’d been out for a couple of hours. I held out my hands. “What can I do for you?”\n\nShe wore the confused look of someone who wasn’t sure if she were breaking a rule. “I hear there’s a log book for visitors to the lookout. Thought I could sign it given it took me all morning to get up here.”\n\n“A visitor book? There might be. This is my first day, my second actually, I came up last night.” I was stammering now and took a breath. “I haven’t seen a visitor’s book. Maybe the last guy took it with him.”\n\nI said the words and didn’t believe them. When Roger disappeared he left everything behind. Why would he take the visitor’s book with him? But I hadn’t seen it anywhere, and there were only so many places it could be.\n\n“Maybe,” I said, and shuffled over to the contraption used to pinpoint the fires. The circular disc and map of the forest stood on top of a cabinet painted yellow. I ran my finger around the sides and found a sliding door and pulled it open. Inside three shelves held various maps and navigation equipment. On the top shelf was a large leather bound book. \n\n“Found it,” I said. \n\nThe girl hesitated in the doorway. \n\n“Come in. Excuse the mess. I’m still unpacking.”\n\nShe let her backpack slide down to the floor and wiped her hands on her shorts. I fumbled for the pen on the shelf and handed it over. I flicked through the pages of names and dates and found the last entry. The day before Roger disappeared. The writing was so stilted that I couldn’t read the name, but the date was clear.\n\nShe signed Rebecca Hughes in impeccable print and then ran a finger over the names on the page. \n\n“There aren’t many who come up here,” she said.\n\n“I guess not.”\n\nShe closed the book and walked to the windows facing east. “This is my dream job, being up here all alone.”\n\n“Mine too,” I said, the last word stifled in another coughing fit that I fought desperately to supress.\n\n“I love it up here. I love the outdoors. And yet I studied accounting. I’ll be chained to a desk the rest of my life.”\n\n“What made you choose it?”\n\n“I’m good with numbers. Aren’t we supposed to do what we’re good at?”\n\nI shrugged. \n\nHer eyes turned to the floor and the open book of mystery script and geometric drawings. \n\n“What is that?”\n\n“I don’t know. I found it on the shelf. Can you read it?”\n\nShe crouched and picked up the book and flicked through the pages. “The writing doesn’t make much sense. But I’ve seen shapes like this. Down in the forest.”\n\n“Shapes? Like rectangles?”\n\n“Yes. Strangest thing. Triangles carved into these enormous trees. The sort of trees you can’t wrap your arms around.”\n\n“Were they burnt out?”\n\nShe shook her head. She closed the book and lay it on the bed. “What does it mean?”\n\n“I have no idea.”\n\n“Sorry I couldn’t help you.” She ended in an upward inflection signifying a question. \n\n“Tom,” I said.\n\n“Tom. It was nice to meet you and sorry again to wake you.”\n\nI waved a hand at her. “I should be working anyway. If you see any Rangers, don’t tell them I was asleep.”\n\n“Your secret is safe with me.”\n\n“Did you want to stay for a drink or something?”\n\nShe slid a water bottle out her backpack and threaded her arm through the strap. “Thanks anyway, but there’s a clearing I want to reach in time to get my tent up before dark. Then one more peak and back to the real world. Nice to meet you Tom.”\n\n“You too.”\n\nShe let herself out and waved through the window as she walked east down the slope. I wondered if she would come back up after spotting the burnt out tree with the triangle etched into the trunk, but she didn’t. \n\nThe coming of the hiker and the news that there were other trees in the forest with rectangles carved in them prompted a call to Martina. I had to this point kept the strange events to myself, but Rebecca entering my space and seeing the markings in the book broke the taboo of the subject. I no longer feared ridicule. \n\n“Martina, are you there?”\n\nA few beats went by. A breathless Martina finally answered. “I’m here Tom.”\n\n“I have a strange question. I had a hiker come up here this morning.”\n\n“Already? That didn’t take long. There aren’t many who come up this way.”\n\n“She said she saw some trees in the valley marked with triangles. Have you seen anything like that?”\n\nA few seconds went by. When Martina spoke again her voice sounded robotic, as if reading from a script. “Can’t say I have.”\n\n“Do you know what it means?”\n\n“No idea.”\n\nI tapped the antenna of the radio on my forehead and kept going. “I saw one too. A triangle. On a burnt out tree near my lookout. And then one appeared on the door to the toilet. And there’s this weird book here with writing I can’t read and it has shapes all through it, some of them triangles.” I realised I was starting to ramble and stopped.\n\n“That’s weird.”\n\n“Roger never said anything? He never saw anything?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Maybe it’s just me.”\n\n“Has something happened?”\n\n“Something attacked me last night. Well, attacked is a bit strong. It banged on the door. While I was locked in the outhouse.”\n\n“Probably a deer.”\n\n“It wasn’t…” I hadn’t seen the thing. I didn’t know what it was or what it wasn’t. “I don’t think it was an animal. It carved a rectangle on the door.”\n\n“There isn’t anything out here that would do that. Do you know what I think? For the first time in your life you are detached completely from society. This happens sometimes. Your mind fills in the void. It’s what makes sailors see mermaids and krakens below the waves. It will pass.”\n\n“I didn’t imagine it!” I shouted into the radio and flung it into the corner of the room. I stormed out the door and stomped to the eastern side of the peak and immediately felt like a child. I took a few deep breaths and leaned against the shelter for the wood. She didn’t believe me. Of course she didn’t, would I believe someone who told me such things? If only I could show her. But I was here and she was there.\n\nA smudge of colour flitted between the trees below. The red of Rebecca’s backpack, lonely amongst the green. I scanned the forest ahead looking for the clearing she mentioned. I couldn’t see anything. \n\nThe afternoon dragged. I muted the volume on the radio to Martina. I pulled the encyclopedia of tree species in North America off the shelf and flicked through it. There were full page glossy photographs and captions of names in Latin. One page was dog eared. I opened it and someone had underlined a few sentences at the bottom of the page. It concerned tree species whose cones split under the heat of fire to release the seeds within. They needed fire to regenerate. I shut the book and put it back on the shelf.\n\nAt 3pm I sent down the second and final weather report of the day. No smoke. No lightning. Humidity increasing, there might be some rain on the way. On the western horizon grey clouds intermingled with the white that had dominated the day. \n\nI hurried outside and grabbed a load of logs for the fire. This may not be a passing shower like yesterday. I dumped the logs in the metal bucket and lifted my head at the smell of rain, carried on the wind through the still open door. The first drops pattered against the roof and I pulled the door shut. \n\nThe clouds above darkened and the rain intensified. If the weather did set in I didn’t have much wood for the evening. I cursed my lack of preparation. \n\nMy head snapped around at movement in my periphery. Someone was out there. A woman with jet black hair and pale skin. My first thought was another hiker, but she wore a long, flowing dress the colour of the ocean. She was barefoot. Was it Martina? Was this an extension of the prank from last night?\n\nI edged to my left and bent down and picked up the radio thrown in anger after my morning conversation with Martina. I kept my eyes on the woman and turned the volume dial. It made a little click. \n\nThe woman outside seemed untroubled by the rain and came closer to the window. We were separated by a few paces and a thin layer of glass. She fixed her eyes on mine, deep blue eyes like the ocean. She pursed her lips and blew a cloud of mist onto the window. I felt the cold. Tiny droplets formed icicles for a moment and then melted away and joined the rain streaming down to the ground.\n\n“Martina, are you there?”\n\nNo response. The woman outside brought up her hand to a silver necklace hanging around her neck. It hung a triangle pendant, the triangle hanging upside down, the point directed at the ground. Her eyes widened and she opened her mouth as if to speak.\n\nThe radio crackled. “Tom! Where have you been?” It was Martina.\n\n“There’s someone here.”\n\n“Another hiker?”\n\n“No. I don’t think so.”\n\nThe woman’s lips moved like she was speaking, but no sound came. And then over the sound of the rain I heard the same whispering as the night before. Barely audible, but with a rhythm that matched the opening and closing of her mouth. Shh sounds and breathy syllables.\n\n“Talk to me Tom.”\n\n“I’m freaking out. Is this some joke? Are you in on this?”\n\n“In on what Tom?”\n\nThe woman turned and took a step away from the glass. She raised an arm parallel to the ground and pointed north. Martina’s lookout was west. The hiker Rebecca had walked east. What was north?\n\nThe radio crackled and the voice of a man spoke. “Tell her to leave.”\n\n“Who is this?”\n\n“You have to force her to leave,” the voice repeated.\n\n“Roger? Is that you?” Martina’s voice was high pitched, almost hysterical. \n\nRoger? The Roger who went missing? The Roger who occupied my lookout before me. The Roger who I suspected as the author of the scribbles and geometric shapes in the black book from the shelf?\n\nRoger spoke again, louder and slower than before, annunciating each syllable. “You have to go out there. She is dangerous.”\n\nShe didn’t look dangerous, standing out there in the rain and pointing. Then it struck me. She stood in the rain, but her dress billowed out as if dry, and her hair fell in thick waves. She stood in the rain but somehow she was not wet. \n\nThe radio trembled in my hand. “If she’s dangerous then I’m not going out there.”\n\n“This has happened before. She is terrified of fire. It is fire that will make her leave.” His voice was calm. \n\nI backed up towards the fireplace. I stumbled on my bag and tumbled to the floor. The woman outside was unperturbed, a statue pointing in the rain. I crawled to the fireplace and shoved some paper and the thinnest of the logs inside and lit a match. At the burst of light the woman’s head snapped around. She turned away as if the glow hurt her eyes. \n\nI opened the glass door to the fireplace. The flames were low and subdued. I grabbed the unburnt end of a log and pulled it from the fire, the other end smouldering red. I scrambled to the door and found the handle. \n\nIn a flurry of adrenaline I burst outside and skipped towards her. I shouted unintelligible syllables firing in staccato bursts of pent up fear. She turned to me, her eyes bulging. I held up the log, a pitiful glow of red embers and thick black smoke. But it was enough. Her face changed. Her eyes widened and she opened her mouth in fear. Her skin bubbled as if bugs crawled underneath, scurrying up her neck and over her face. She brought up her hands and clawed at her cheeks. I almost wretched at the sight.\n\nShe wailed a high pitched scream that shook the timber deck below my feet. My heart skipped a beat and then thundered back to life, feeling like it would explode in my chest. She retreated and I took a hesitant step forwards. She wailed again, louder than before and I closed my eyes and brought my hands to my ears. The sound stopped. I opened my eyes and the woman was gone. I ran jumped off the deck and scanned the top of the peak. She couldn’t have run away that fast.  \n\nI noticed the rain for the first time, drops spilling into my eyes. The embers at the end of the log fizzled out. And then, as if someone flicked a switch, the rain stopped. I scurried back to the door and into the lookout. I still had the radio in my hand.\n\n“She’s gone. I don’t see her anywhere.”\n\n“Good.” The man almost sighed. \n\n“Will she come back?”\n\n“No.”\n\nThe reply came with conviction and it settled my frayed nerves a little. My legs turned to jelly, the adrenaline leaving my muscles. \n\nMartina’s voice again, urgent and rushed. “Roger where are you? Where have you been?”\n\nThe radio was silent. Water dripped from my body and onto the floor. The sudden chill caught in my chest and I launched into a coughing fit so intense my stomach muscles cramped. I doubled over and collapsed to the floor.\n\nAnd then came the response.\n\n“I am where I always was. In the forest.”\n\n [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessFromSundown/comments/y3ngzo/welcome_message/)",

        "text": "I (26f) am a 3rd shift caregiver and worked at a AFC/ assisted living for almost 3 years, and I know for sure it's haunted.... but they don't harm people:\n\nWhen I first started working here I met the shadow man..... shadow man creeps me out but he's never harmed me or the consumers in the home, so when I do my blessings I make sure he doesn't get kicked out because I feel like he's a protector of these guys, BUT he is aware that I know he's ther...how do I know... because at Halloween he fucked with me, last Halloween we decorated the house for a Halloween haunted tour for a contest, my manager, and her cousin ( who works in the office) and they had robotic witches, trees, Mike Myers, 2 scary clowns..., I was pregnate at that time and I already jad to use the bathroom when I got there I jumped and drizzled down my leg and luckily I jad extra scrubs...\nIt was really creepy in the office... durring the night when I would come back and log in the notes of my nights.... I noticed a few of them would either move their head, arms, legs, positions, one time I came in three the scare crow arm came down on me and I screamed so loud one of my residents came back and checked on me.\nHow I know shadow man is there? I see him crossing the room in the corner in my eyes, and one time I was at the stove preparing for a meal for the day I saw a man standing behind me and I jumped and turned around no one was there......, he's there also around Christmas time because some consumers aren't able to go see for family, so he would go check on them.... recently in the year I have seen a woman in a long write old fashioned nighty gown, I hear my name called by a consumer who had passed early 2022, and when it's super quiet I can hear footsteps but no one is awake... I can't remeber if it was befor or after my daughter, I think it was after I went to the lower layer of the house ( it's a 3 story house, with basement) I was in the freezer pulling stuff out to unthaw for the next couple of days, I was walking back up and a lazy boy chair was rocking.... and kept rocking like someone was there I pretended I dident noticed and ran to the office ( which is were staff entered when they came here, there is small parking lot behind the building) and I sat there for ain't and one of my early bird consumers came up and I went to say hi, and the chair was still, usually the chair will still keep rocking after someone had sat in it..this was STILL.... I have more stories regarding my job and personal experiences, but I'm really tired and I figure to posy some more another day..",
