Can I apply for the Direct PLUS loan after I initially accept the unsubsidized loan award or do I have to hold off on accepting the unsubsidized loan until I apply for Direct PLUS?

        "text": "\n\nPosting this for my friend who is an M3. \n\nSo, long story short, M3 here; regret going into medicine, have hated every rotation thus far but was largely neutral towards psychiatry, though I would prefer to avoid seeing patients everyday, or at all. That leads me to radiology and pathology, and while I'm not competitive enough for rads, path is a viable option, and for the most part I do like the CP side of the specialty. However, the bread and butter of pathology is still histology, and I am an ABYSMAL visual learner, I struggle with anatomy and routinely ignore slides or radiographs on test questions as they only serve to trip me up. Sorry for such a dreary post, I just feel at I'm at the end of the line with these two specialties, and am not so sure of how to proceed. Any and all advice from either field, as well as any others is appreciated.",

        "text": "Some of us slipped through the cracks (or the holes if the Swiss cheese model) and made it here. You know, the kids that were in all ap classes in high school but it was clear to them they were the dumbest in the classes and barely passed. \n\nGet through orgo chem in college somehow. Maintain a 2.6 gpa and pulled it up to a whopping 2.9 right before application season. took a year off to \"find yourself\" but it was actually you just studying for your third MCAT retake. Pull a random score between 22 and 29. Send out 50 applications and your boy who goes to one DO school says he will put in a good word for you and that happens to be the only school that accepts you. Wait, someone accepted you into medical school. How????\n\nNever realizing how lucky you are because you're too busy with your prestigious life hobbies like sleeping, chilling with your SO, netflix, and maybe just ONE skilled hobby (StarCraft?). \n\nYou start medical school and you are in your habitat finally! You are in the zone baby! Jk, your bullshitting your way through labs, parroting the excitement of your classmates (they are really passionate about biochem pathway team learning exercises!). Go to a class get together at a bar. Get drunk, go home with some random classmate. She ignores you the rest of the year as you are a liability to her passion and get hard only for infectious diseases facade.\n\n2nd year, your one friend who got you in is gone for rotations and one real friend you made last year flunks out. Fuck this shit. Stay at home all of second year. Barely get by your classes again but at least you can be yourself instead of student Dr. Stuck-in-manic-episode. After all, yourself won't judge you, right? Mr Underwood, you missed this mandatory class. \"No sir I forgot to sign in\". Mr underfuck the class is still in session and you are clearly not here. \"Well one trip to the professionalism committee isn't going to end my career as an underslut\". You were right.\n\nOh hey it's board exam season and you realize you don't want to work hard in the future. Invest in derm! Buy Adderall and hit that first aid and uworld. Wow, your teaching yourself medicine for what seems like the first time. What the hell did you learn the first two years? For fuck sakes you failed the comlex exam. What happen you were getting 450s in practice exams? Must have been a fluke, retake it again without studying any more than you previously did. 140 point increase. Right! This is a fair exam. Maybe we should do the usmle just to be on the safe side a little hard work now will provide a lot of lazy free hours in the future. Boom baby 208. You'll take it! \n\n3rd year. 3 of your classmates in your first rotation and these mother fuckers don't recognize you at all . You know why ;). Make buddies with one of them and tag along with them and have them take the lead with every patient until you can parrot their bullshit. Getting pimped? Just say anything, you're wrong, so what, attending doesn't care. Other students offer to go home and study the topic and return tomorrow and give a presentation. Mr underfrog, would you like to present this case tomorrow? \"Ah, sorry Dr 35yearsoldbutlook50becauseinternalmedicinetookmyyouth I'm still kind of moving into my apartment.\" \"Ah, the atnt internet people are coming in today I think I have to handle that mess today\" \"I just got punched in the balls by a raccoon so I have to set up an appointment to get my rabies shot today\". Cuz you know, you've been on board grind for so long, third year is suppose to be your vacation before you have to do that shit for step 2 again. At least you wont be around these fake classmates again? \"Dr coolfuck, undermightyduck isn't here and you wrote in our evaluations that he was here all month\" \"yes I did mister Nguyen Patelberg, and if you want me to still sign off on that letter of rec THAT YOU WILL BE WRITING YOURSELF still, keep your whore mouth shut. I get paid for him 'being here'.\"\n\nOh fuck, there's no FA for step 2. Maybe you should have paid attention in the wards. Or maybe there's this thing called onlinemeded that's kept you barely alive for shelves and it'll work for step 2. Hey last time you only did 20q blocks of uworld a day. Let's bump it up to 30 and start earlier (maybe). 230, knocked it out of the park! How? Maybe you have a chance at avoiding shitty primary care long hours of moving your limbs around all day. \n\nPath! Omg yes. You sit in a lab from 8-4. You go home. They accept anyone with a heartbeat! Better throw in some rads and gas in there. The anesthesiologist in the gen surgery and gi rotations just came in the morning and sat next to sleeping patients and played games on their phones the entire procedure and went home at 2pm. Sometimes they had night calls, and that is something you are vehemently against. Nothing too early, nothing too late, youre a simple peasant. Remove gas from your options. Path is looking good so you hop on to reddit and sdn and find out there's no jobs. Now you are perfectly comfortable with being unemployed, I mean that's the status quo until now, but you racked up 400k of debt. Had to take those grad plus loans for vacations and Amazon purchases right? Remove all the low tier path programs from your list. Ok so you are at rads, mid tier path programs, aaaand ?psych? \n\nGo to interviews, you are ready to bullshit. The interviewers don't really know how to interview so they just keep saying \"what ooottherr questions do you have about our program.\" Mother fuckers ask me why I failed my first comlex so I can tell you about this fake story I made up about a raccoon and these nutz. \n\nMatch day. Nothing. Scramble. Take a shotgun and start blasting. Get into a mid tier gas program. How??? Wake up at 3:36am and run to the hospital. Give a pregnant woman an epidural. Fall asleep in some machine that had a bed attached to it. Wake up and your phone is filled with messages from the chief resident asking where you are. You don't really know. You look up and it says c.a.t. You fell asleep under the cat scanner. You are the undercat.\n\n\\-- This is a story by [u/Tannerstage6](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tannerstage6/). I read this post too often and as match approaches I felt like I needed to share it again. To all my undercat's out there, we've got this!",

I planned on double majoring in kinesiology and biochemistry (thoughts?). What are some things that I can do to help me get better experience with healthcare and build my resume for medical school? I planned on becoming a Certified Personal Trainer over the summer and working for a gym. I also started volunteering for the RedCross, local charities from my college, and I plan to volunteer at a hospital over the summer.

        "text": "So I dropped out on Sunday this week. For context, I’m not in my 20s (younger) and I was in my second year (different system than the U.S ig). I couldn’t take a leave of absence until next year and couldn’t switch until next year either, but I decided I had enough and made the decision after talking to my parents about it. \nSo in the beginning, I graduated high school with almost perfect grades but didn’t figure out what major I wanted to pursue yet. Application season came around and everyone was convinced that I would be amazing as a doctor and I have the grades for it etc etc. My dad really wanted me to pursue medicine and I’m known in my family to have an amazing memory so they persuaded me further to get into medicine, time was running out so I did it thinking I would become a psychiatrist since I’ve always been fond of neuroscience and psychology and everything relevant to it. Got into the top med school in my country maintained a eh well enough to have me stay GPA so ig everything was alright. But I hated studying, it was all memorization and I did not enjoy it one bit. Along with that, I’ve been suffering with my mental health for years and I went into med school not fixing it which made things worse and (won’t get much into it) been living in a toxic environment which made studying 297392% harder as I couldn’t focus at all. Had no friends, gained weight, didn’t have time to do any hobbies and even if I did I had no energy to do them after studying, all my interests and hobbies basically went out the window and my eyes were glued to a med book 24/7. Absolutely hated but I stuck thru to take the psychiatry course which wasn’t until my fifth year. Skipped completely a quiz bc I was just extremely burned out and had constant panic attacks so I slept in and told the instructor I was sick. Parents told me to travel to cure my “burnout” so I visited my sister in another city for three days and we had lots of fun, came back and my “burnout” was still there and I ended not studying efficiently for yet another quiz, my gpa started to fluctuate completely bc I just didn’t care anymore and I wanted out. And it’s super hard to transfer to another major bc they consider the gpa you’re holding currently and based on it you will either get accepted or not. I was left with no options and finals were coming up and I couldn’t get myself out of bed, I wanted my old life back doing the things I love and work in a different field. So many factors were worsening my mental health and I couldn’t take it anymore dropped out. Currently signing up for many volunteering programs and even gonna work at a family member’s company for a few days (internship basically). Filling up my CV basically with courses and experience. I feel like I’m 17 again and restarting from zero. Figuring out what I really wanna do through working then try again during application season this year. Wish me luck.\n\n(This is not a complete vent cause my phone started logging for some reason)\n\nI would love to hear y’all thoughts on my decision.\nIm in no debt thankfully cause I’m predicting I’ll get comments like that referring to debt and loans and stuff.",

        "text": "Have you ever wondered why DOs and MDs are still treated as two separate designations in the medical field? Despite the fact that many argue there is no significant difference in curriculum and testing, DOs are still required to take additional coursework in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) and must pass both the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Exam (COMLEX) to compete for competitive specialties.\n\nSo, what are the obstacles to fully unifying the designation of DOs and MDs, and what is being done about it? Some argue that the fear of reducing the prestige of the MD designation is holding back the unification, but many DOs and MDs point out that schools like TCOM (Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine) are often ranked higher than MD schools.\n\nIt's time to ask ourselves, why not simply call DOs \"MDs\" and move on? The confusion and segregation created by maintaining two separate designations is unnecessary and only adds to the already complex nature of the medical field. Let's work towards unifying the designation of DOs and MDs and putting an end to this needless division.\n\nSo, what do you think are the reasons for maintaining separate designations for DOs and MDs? And what can we do to overcome the obstacles to unification? Share your thoughts and let's work towards a more unified and simplified medical field.",
