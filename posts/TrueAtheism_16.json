        "text": "Any advice is definitely appreciated.\n\nNow, I'm fully aware of the fact that I'm a bit OVER-cautious about keeping my secularism hidden in the workplace. I've had many atheists tell me that I shouldn't hide it, and shouldn't be ashamed. Well, I am not ashamed. I'm very happy with my lack of religion, and it's a huge part of the person I am. But my workplace is primarily older, very religious people. I had a similar problem at another job, and it didn't go very well when people found out. Seeing as I value my income, and don't want to walk into a place every day where people treat me poorly, I keep it on the hush hush. And up until last week, this was going fine.\n\nSee, the truth is, I've been very angry lately. Very antsy. I'm usually very *overly* respectful of religion (even in situations where I probably shouldn't be) because I put far too much value in having everyone like me. But starting with the Pulse shooting, which hit close to home, and perpetuated by several other major news stories, I've been very *angry* at religion recently. As a result, I've found it to be much harder to keep my mouth shut; something that I'm usually *very* good at.\n\nI was having a conversation with the gossip-queen of my office last Wednesday, and referenced that I had started listening to an audio book while walking around... The subject having been ways to keep your mind busy during a boring job. She, however, asked me what I was reading. For a split second, I considered lying. But my desire to not hide my view slipped out for a second, and I admitted that I was reading God Is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens. Her reaction bordered on aghast when I explained to her what the book was. I was already desperate to backpedal, but I had inevitably opened Pandora's box. By the end of the night, everyone who was working knew.\n\nThis leads up to one of the funniest, and equally frustrating situations I've ever been in. She walks into my office later that evening with an older male coworker, maybe 65 give or take. He proceeds to have her ask me if I worship the devil. I have to resist the urge to legitimately facepalm, but instead politely explain that since I don't believe in a god, that I therefore also don't believe in Satan. Then they proceed to... I don't know, \"logic\" me into admitting god exists? Probably one of the most bizarre conversations of my life. She asks me \"So where does life come from?\". I respond that we don't have an answer to that question at the present time, but that doesn't automatically mean that we never will. She then turns to the older male co-worker (I'll call him OMC). She says \"OMC, where does life come from?\" And he responds, \"It was created by the lord, of course.\" She then turns to me and does a little half shrug to me that basically says \"See, OMC has an answer... and you don't.\" I then have to try to explain to them that just because there isn't a full scientific explanation *yet*, does not automatically mean God. OMC then proceeds to begin to half-berate me with attempted gotcha-questions, and trying to explain to me that I just *didn't understand*.\n\nThis is where I screwed up big time. I was running on three hours of sleep, it was midnight, and I was severely hormonal as a result of PMS. So I ended up basically half-yelling at him (just raising my voice and taking a very stern tone) that since we clearly have different voews, I would appricate it if he would drop the subject. When he then tried to continue, I had to reiterate my point, word for word, a decibel louder. Certainly not helping my cause, I know, but I was so tired and angry.\n\nHe has behaved differently around me since. Cautious, but in a way almost talking to me as though I'm simultaneously stupid, and a daughter of satan. Not a huge change, just a slight shift in tone and body language.\n\nI'm probably over-thinking this, but I'm genuinely worried for what this is going to do to my work environment. I know I didn't handle it well, it just all caught me so off guard. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to go forward here on in?\n\nAlso, I apologize if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. If it isn't, please direct me to where I can better place it. Thank you :)",

I'm not agnostic either because I'm not waiting for more evidence, I know that no amount of evidence can, or at least should change my view, because while unlike logic, evidence is more convenient and abundant, it's never 100% indisputably conclusive. \n\nNaturally, I did my research but found nothing quite like what I was looking for. The one that came closest was theological noncognitivism, but I don't believe that it's pointless to argue. Hence Buttermilkism. Buttermilk is the by-product of making butter, butter is in this case is settling the religion debate. I couldn't care less about who's right, I do think however, that the by-products of the argument are beneficial. \n\nI'm a buttermilkist because I wan't to be as gray, as neutral as possible; The reason for which I can best explain by my experience debating religion. The common thing I notice when I see a debate between a reasonable theist and a reasonable atheist is that as time passes and the argument progresses they both tend to gravitate towards the \"I'm right, but it doesn't matter\" stance. \n\nSo my question is: Does it really matter whether there is a God or not?

After the Second Coming, I would be resurrected and my body and everyone else's would become literally perfect. Not a single hair missing, as the saying went (I think there's an entire discussion to be had on what perfection even is in the first place, but whatever). Everyone would get a chance to accept Christ, even those who had never heard the \"true gospel\" or those who rejected it. Atheists, like myself, would even have a chance.

What if they all happened in the past and we simply have to rely on history?  Because, if they do happen, they don't happen often?  The Big Bang doesn't seem to happen often; why, then, should we believe it?  We can only really rely on evidence left over from whatever event was there, just as we might with a miracle.\n\nAlso, the arguments against miracles I have seen so far seem pretty circular.  Miracles are improbable/impossible because our experience shows them to be improbable/impossible, therefore all miracle accounts are improbable/impossible because miracles are improbable/impossible because our experience...\n\nI just don't see why we discount miracles thinking them to be illegitimate possibilities for explaining things such as the accounts of Jesus' Resurrection or other things like that miracle.

        "text": "Anyone here who's read the Grand Design by Stephen Hawkins or knows a little about basic Quantum Physics? I'm sorry for the long read but it feels pretty good to get it out of my system. Skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to read the whole thing.\n\nAfter reading up on the book, I see we're not significant in the large scale of universe; now of course we can very well argue about finding meaning amongst ourselves and that it is all that should matter -- the universe still doesn't exactly care about you.\n\nWe also come to a realization that our brains aren't fully equipped to understanding some pretty far out events/phenomenon/actions. Unobservable actions lead me to question what the objective reality is and how an uninformed atheist is quick to deny the possibility of a greater force and mystery (definitely not talking about a god/spirit/flying spaghetti monster or jesus so you can drop the pitchforks).\n\nA fish living inside a concave lensed bowl has a distorted view of reality. Who is one to say what the fish sees isn't exactly real for the fish as it can very well apply it's own laws of nature given the concave view of the external world and make complete sense of it -- within the fish bowl of course. Likewise, if we were to turn upside down and given enough time our brains would rewire itself to perceive the object as downside up. Given that all the animals have a different view on reality as the structure of our brain comes in all crazy shapes and sizes, how do you seek answers to what the objective reality is. Of what goes beyond our minds and basic understanding of science. \n\nThe laws of nature bend when we observe particles and waves on the quantum level -- meaning they sway from Einstein's theory of General Relativity and classical mechanics. The double slit experiment (look it up on google if you haven't) talks about light behaving as a particle and a wave. The entanglement phenomenon shows how certain atoms are entangled meaning if one entangled spinning atom is altered, this affects the other atom regardless of the distance in space. What goes within the fragment of space and emptiness that we haven't exactly comprehended yet? (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-entanglement-creates-new-state-of-matter1/) \n\nThe Multiverse and The String Theory is all but a familiar kick in the nut sack. Odds are we can also very well be a part of the Matrix. I can't help but laugh at an image of a fat neckbeard controlling the fates of our universe as we're just another characters in their version of The Sims game. We replace one mystery for another. Who controls the neckbeard? If it's God, who controls God -- it's never ending and I don't think we can really find out the truth. The concept of soul and free will was destroyed by the plethora of scientists who electronically stimulate certain parts of the human brain to control the movement of their bodies leading them to believe that we're really just biological machines working within the framework of our human brains.\n\nEinstein claims that Quantum Mechanics is an incomplete understanding of the universe (but then what isn't?) but a progressive one nonetheless. Hawkins on the other hand claims it's quite possibly the best route to understanding the strange laws that govern the universe.\n\nMy point being, there's a lot of crazy happening out there in the world and it saddens me that we won't be able to solve the mysteries surrounding the universe at least in our generation or the next few hundreds. More importantly while I reject the notions of an all loving, just and benevolent god and highly critical of the literature within the holy books -- we can't exactly disprove the idea of god altogether in the same vein that we can't disprove a flying spaghetti monster. Some beliefs talk of mysterious energies surrounding the universe and while I only agree with them at that point (but not at all to say that these wistful breaths of fresh air from the goddess Luna or flowery farts from the great lord off Zeus' tooshie himself)-- it goes off as a little too self-centred when they say that these energies are responsible for their moods, their days and their lives in general which is an ultimate slap in the face of logic. We can only claim evidence for what we perceive within the ranks of our brains. What goes beyond our minds can not be proven and will be left to test at a blinding leap of fate (or an intelligent assumption) which is completely absurd. While I draw to no conclusions about god and I still try to read, discuss and enhance my knowledge on the subject, I don't dispel the idea altogether -- only to twist it to serve my personal criterion of what god really is.\n\nA humble bearded man up in the sky taking notes of who goes to heaven and hell or an untimely jealous god who'd test one of his followers to prove his love for him by sacrificing his kid and then replacing that said kid with a sheep only leads me to believe he's the biggest troll in the universe and is clearly not the kind of god i'm talking about.",

        "text": "I like to ask that question. This is a hypothetical question. Suppose you had a son who was raised non-denominational secular Christian. Or no real religion that demanded anything beyond holiday celebrations that are mostly cultural. This son goes off to college for for years and comes back a \"Born again\" Christian saying \"praise Jebuz\" and warning the whole family about hell and Satan and telling you about the Glory of heaven. So you tell him to back off ... and after some conversation it seems that he jumped into religion during college because he was depressed , lonely , under stress and such and such and his Christian fellowship on campus seemed to help with all that so he could actually get on with his studies and has inwardly happy. But once back in his home he starts to think all the prayers and rejoice songs are nice and make him happy but is based on a myth. Based on ancient superstition so his rational mind ( and you the father ) seem to agree that it is best that he just lives life as he did before without the opiate of Christianity. So after a few months he falls back into depression. He is anxious, depressed and such and such. He really is of no danger to himself or others and he does hold down a \"life\" and a job BUT has a nagging depression. He knows if he goes back into the \"mantra mode\" of prayers and songs and fellowship it may make him happy again but he decides to try Zoloft instead. And the results and similar although distinctly different. The point is lets say he can function with one or the other and his mind is \"content.\" So now your dear, dear son wants to make a choice between religion and the pill. How would you advise him if you were a hardcore atheist or moderate agnostic?",

Accordingly, a *reductio* seems to require an alternative explanation for the anal hair of men, that is neither evolutionary nor theological. \n\nI realised after writing it out that I have a suppressed premise required for *6*, but as that premise is obvious and I can't be bothered adding it and correcting all the numbers, employ a charitable reading. No doubt there are other omissions that should similarly be charitably added. \n\nHave fun!",

        "text": "I often hear objectors to the God hypothesis state that their lack of belief stems from a lack of evidence. This post is created to address those who specifically mean scientific evidence as opposed to evidence in its broadest form. \n\nFor example, we have shown that heliocentrism and plate tectonic theory are true with scientific confirmations.\n\nWe have shown that geometry's theorems are true based on logical evidence, and not scientific confirmations.\n\nWe have shown that philosophical frameworks - like deductive syllogism are true based on logical evidence, and not scientific empiricism.\n\nThe point here is that scientific evidence is extremely useful, but it does have its limitations when investigated deeply.\n\nNow for the God hypothesis...for those who are *only* interested in scientific verification for God, I want to argue that Occam's Razor makes this downright impossible to do.\n\nTo elaborate, I have provided a short syllogism.\n\n\n1. God if he exists, by definition, is an infinite being who transcends space-time.\n\n2. Science is a system that measures finite data within the confines of space-time.\n\n3. Therefore, using Occam's Razor, any apparent scientific evidence for a transcendent God must alternatively be best seen as the product of something finite in space-time.\n\n**Premise 1**\n\nThis is the standard definition for God in most popular theistic frameworks\n\n**Premise 2**\n\nThis is a well known aspect about science. All of the data we collect exist finitely and exist within our space-time dimensions.\n\n**Premise 3**\n\nEven if the stars aligned themselves to say \"I God am real,\" then it would be infinitely more probable for an advanced alien species to have either 1. actually moved the stars or 2. create this worldwide delusion.\n\nAn advanced alien species here will be taken as living finite within our universe, and so is ontologicaly simpler to use as an explanation than an infinite/transcendent cause.\n\nAnother more probable reason for God's apparent and scientific evidence would be that a law of nature caused an evidence to come into being naturally. Suppose there is a bright form of a huge human-like being glowing in the sky. This could more easily be the result of some form of natural phenomena, similar to the northern lights, than an actual transcendent deity.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? My argument is essentially saying scientific evidence wouldn't show that God exists, because any alternative explanation is simpler to explain.\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\n2nd Edit: I meant \"Occam's Razor\" and not \"Pascal's Wager.\"\n\n**3rd Edit: Thanks a lot for the discussion everyone. I think everyone agreed with my general conclusion (even though the syllogism was a little bit sloppy). To elaborate, if you want to study whether God exists or not, it would be absurd to think that science alone can give you the answer. Theology is the philosophical branch that deals with logical truths about God, and whether his existence is actual.**\n\n**In light of a lot of misunderstandings or repetitive inquiry, I believe [existence and logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR_RFJernjE) go hand in hand. You cannot have one without the other. I also think [philosophy, religion, and science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxsrB6pLhVc) are all different branches of the same tree. Namely, knowledge.**\n\n**We touched based on how some very smart people think abstract objects like numbers or mathematical truths exist independent of the physical world/human minds. I don't know if that is true, but if it is, it's a very neutral way of thinking - there is no need for atheism or deism in those philosophies.**\n\n**My \"Agenda\": as u/igottroubledthoughts pointed out, my personal history is an imperfect one. I have personally grown a lot in maturity and understanding, and I hope to help others grow as well. I used to have another account long ago where I would be attacking theism as strong or stronger than what I get, so karma I guess...I have always sided with reason and truth, and that is what I held to when I was an atheist myself, and what I still currently hold to today. My religious faith or lack thereof is simply a consequence of where I see reason and evidence taking me.**\n\n**I meant no threat to anyone, and I am willing to PM anyone if you wanted to discuss any other topic further. Even if you just need a friend to talk to, I offer religiously neutral discourse**",

Logic helps us understand the world around us not because the world is based off logic, but rather because logic is based off of how the universe works. If the laws of how the universe operated were different, then the laws of logic would be much different as well. So if the way the universe works is the foundation of logic, then without the universe, logic has no foundation. Logic only works in our universe. Therefore, before the universe was created, there would be no logic because there would be no foundation for it. The law of cause and effect need not apply outside the universe.\n\nChristian: But aren't you using logic to make the claim?\n\nI don't think this Christian's argument against my rebuttal for the cosmological argument works, but I don't know how to explain why his last statement doesn't work.

True compassion is based on unconditional desire. If you have to refrain from murdering people because you want into heaven, you might have incredible self-control, but you are in no way a good person. Bad intent still exists within you. Sitting on a church pew thinking about how much you despise certain people doesn't make you a good person. An atheist who does good will always be a more moral person by default. Because it is unconditional. But of course a religious person will claim an atheist only does good because God's controlling them. So much for free will then.\n\nSo next time someone brings up the \"moral compass\", be sure to ask them \"On what conditions are your morals motivated by?\" If they say \"God\", simply say \"Well that's too bad, I do good because I want to.\"\n\nEdit- TLDR; Are you capable of doing good without reward?

        "text": "Ok, so this issue actually only occurs, I think, among those religious people who are also economic conservatives who believe in the merits of free markets and capitalism. I'm not going to argue one way or another on that. \n\nWhat I want to focus on is the standing theory of value within capitalistic systems: supply and demand. When we place products on the market, how we value that item for purchase is based on two things: how many of these are already available for purchase elsewhere and how much do I want/need. If our demand is constant, then adding more of a product will decrease the value of all alike products. Most people know this, I just wanted to lay it out.\n\nThe problem arises when we accept this theory of value but also want to believe in an afterlife. \"Eternal life\" in the \"Kingdom of God\" Sounds nice at face value, but our valuing an eternal paradise just doesn't make sense given that theory. If that theory of value stands then we ought not value the prospect of eternal life. If demand is constant, then making supply infinite causes the value to drop to zero. \n\nAgain, this is only a problem if you accept both of those ideas at the same time. You can fix it by accepting either a different value theory or a different metaphysical prospect. The problem with the first one is that this theory of value is so deeply ingrained in our economy and lifestyles. My answer is to abandon the whole idea of afterlife and accept that my life is a finite thing. This justifies my feeling that my life has value, at least to me. \n\nSo how do you guys feel about this issue? Do you agree or do you think that there are ways around it? Or do you have a different solution?",

I hear the arguments that any religion which was constantly being bombed would be lashing outwards, and it isn't fair to criticize islam.\n\n\n\nI see that as all somewhat true; but I still see the stats about opinion polls of muslims, where a majority agree that homosexuality is not acceptable, I see that a majority of them condone violence against infidels, and I see the european stats before and after the refugee/immigration crises.Those large sets of data lead me to the conclusion that it is primarily an Islamic religious movement.\n\n\n\nI then cite passages in the religious books, with interpretations from historians, where it is teaching sharia law type teachings, and I argue how those are influential on someone's minds, and many are taught these from a young age. They will argue that nobody interprets the books in the same way, and it is impossible to determine whether someone truly believes in something they are learning.\n\n\n\n\nI'm looking for something that will stop them from calling me a bigot against muslims, but I am sure there are logical fallacies in their arguments, but I can't poke holes in them.\n\n\n\nAnyone able to point me in some helpful directions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n\n",

        "text": "tl;dr:  Today I learned that a guy I thought would end up a preacher at some point instead switched to atheism after hearing me discuss it on a few occasions.\n\nI've been an atheist for quite some time, and it's pretty well known among my coworkers.  I never bring it up, but as I live in a fairly religious city, and my coworkers and I work in a close-knit environment where such discussions aren't seen as workplace violations, but more like conversations between family members (we spend 60+ hours a week together in a fairly stressful environment), faith has come up, and I've always been the odd one out when it does.  I'm comfortable with it, and I discuss my non-belief when asked, but one of the main aspects of atheism that drew me to it was the non-recruitment factor.  I'll be me, you be you, and let's just do our thing.  Because we're all so close, though, there's been plenty of debate over the years, and some ribbing directed at me for thinking a way none of them could wrap their heads around, but I'm thick-skinned and stubborn, so I just stick to my guns and make my point and let the matter drop.\n\nApparently during one of these debates, I ended up planting a seed in the mind of one of the more devoutly religious members of my team.  He's always been a cool guy, and never tried the moral superiority angle ... a rare form of open-minded christian, but who I always thought was about one step away from becoming a pastor since he was always verbally passionate about his faith, and he has that type of charisma that makes people want to listen to him.\n\nA few months ago, after he transferred to another division, he gave me a call and said he wanted to pick my brain about a few topics related to atheism, and I said sure, whenever he had time, but I didn't hear anything more about it from him, and I didn't think anything of it.  He sounded like maybe he was having a crisis of faith, and he probably wouldn't have liked my answers, since I would have told him he should probably hold off on giving up his beliefs until things calmed down and he could consider it all with a clearer mind.  Mental and emotional stress create the worst times to try to make a life-changing decision.\n\nFlash forward to this morning, and he popped up in my office and was, for lack of a better term, bubbling with his new-found atheism, and thanking me for helping to open his eyes.  Which was nice, I suppose, though I'm terrible with compliments, and while it was nice to see someone figure out what a load of bunk religion is, I still cringed a bit because he's not the closet type, and I know he comes from a large religious family, and I'd hate to see him ostracized or disowned from something he has always been extremely close to.  As it was, he was trying to preach atheism to me, and he already knew I agreed with him.  But apparently he's respected enough in his family and community that when he's discussed his newfound non-faith, he was able to get people to listen to him rather than shun him ... so more power to him in that regard, I suppose.\n\nHe's still a fledgling in all of this, though, (and I'm by no means an expert debater), and while his spirit is in the right place, some of what he was saying was slightly flawed, logically.   He's still in the transitional period in which he knows the new place where he wants to be, but is still using all of his old maps to get there.  So I made a few points to guide him towards a more logical way of thinking and to add a few facts here and there to help support his arguments (I've never been one to tell someone they are flat out wrong about something when they're trying to learn ... it never worked with me, and a lot of people have an extreme negative reaction to it, especially the older they get).  Eventually, we had to get back to work, but he left just as enthusiastic about his new freedom as when he showed up, so I can at least believe I didn't do any harm.\n\nStill, it's the first time I've run into an atheist and have them point at me as their inspiration to basically change their entire world view.  This time last year he would have told me under no uncertain terms that I was simply wrong about how I viewed religion and the existence of a god.  I don't know what final straw caused him to consider the alternative, and it will be interesting to see if it still sticks after the \"shiny new toy\" status of non-belief wears off, but for now, it appears I inadvertently convinced an unlikely new member to join our numbers.\n\nHas anyone else stumbled into convincing people to drop their deeply held beliefs and switch over to atheism?  I'd be interested in your stories and especially in how you handled it.",

And fusion is the thing that happens when an individual identifies very strongly with a group, a few people, etc. E.g.: you'd sacrifice yourself for your family. Fusion is made stronger by painful (physical and/or emotional) experiences that high-light that individual-group identification (while reading it, hazing popped up in my mind).\n \nWhile I find my 'common sense' gut-feeling agreeing with this to a large extent, but I also think the role of specific religious beliefs might be underplayed a bit. At the author seems to allude to it in the last paragraph, I think:\n \n&gt; It is possible, in principle, to modify the perceived authenticity and sharedness of such experiences through subtle interventions, at both an interpersonal and population level. Not only politicians, educators, and other public figures, but crucially also parents, religious groups, and their leaders could play a role in the process. But that will only be possible if we are all better informed about the real causes of violent intergroup conflict. In the end, science-driven approaches are likely to do far more than censorship and anti-Islamist rhetoric to stem the tide of radicalization, and to defuse those already committed to extreme pro-group action.\n \nIf religious groups, leaders, and.. I assume arguments can be used to make the degree of fusion less, surely it can be used to make fusion stronger. What comes to mind first is: if you identify a lot with the people at your local mosque and are told \"all Muslims are your brothers, more than non-Muslim family members\", then I think it would be more likely that this can have a positive effect on the degree with fusion towards Muslims in general.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

I've been an atheist for a few years, growing up agnostic and religiously skeptical - my parents were both raised Southern baptist but did not enforce religion on me growing up (at least not that much).\n\nIf as a child you have caring moralistic parents, you're raised with the same morals yourself.  But if the morals have no religious basis, what do we base them on?  There would be obvious ones, such as no murdering, no hurting of each other overall - including physical, emotional, etc.   I suppose morals can be based from government laws as well as a basic understanding of cause/effect.  I may have just answered my own question, but regardless, I am planning on being a father relatively soon, and would like more input on how morals work.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the feedback.  This question was sparked by a video I recently watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynJwvv7wlFc  It made me question where morality originates from, but after re-watching, realized the preacher/speaker didn't make much sense and tiptoed around the question, meanwhile the atheist asking the question didn't have a good straight answer for his basis for morality.",

My group at home have many \"atheist X\" members, such as atheistic satanists, atheistic wiccans, atheistic Christians, atheistic Jews, atheistic agnostics, atheistic humanists, atheistic spiritualists, atheistic buddhists, atheistic skeptics, atheistic hindu's, atheistic pseudo-science nuts, atheistic radicals (of any political persuasion), atheistic pastafarians, atheistic pagans, you get what I mean. Atheism is a great term to say \"I don't believe what my majority local religion believes\" but it does NOTHING to say \"I don't believe in the things that CAUSE the problems that my local majority religion propagates.\" IMO, **the problems of religion comes from dogmatic anti-skepticism, not their belief in skydaddy, skydaddy is a symptom**, and thus David Silverman's proposal is like trying to cure cancer by wearing a shirt supporting lung cancer, and then telling everyone else who wants to cure cancer \"you need to get on board.\" \n\nI am a skeptic. I am an atheistic skeptic. But my skepticism is more important, more pure, more virtuous, and more descriptive of me, than atheism. Atheism is a label Christians give me. Skepticism is my label.\n\nAs for his tone, I find him very impersonal, I think his knowledge of those he's attacking is off-base, and recently he seems to fancy himself a statistician, which IMO is laughable.\n\n**EDIT:** Academic Definitions of Religion: Emile Durkheim\n\"a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden -- beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church all those who adhere to them.\"\n\nWilliam James - \"The very fact that they are so many and so different from one another is enough to prove that the word 'religion' cannot stand for any single principle or essence, but is rather a collective name.\"\n\n**EDIT 2:** A list of links for atheistic religions:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_atheism http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/01/atheistic-wicca/ http://semrys.blogspot.com/2012/12/pagan-atheists-yes-we-exist.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism_in_Hinduism\ndisbelief in God or gods has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the orthodox and heterodox streams of Hindu philosophies.[1] In Indian philosophy, three schools of thought are commonly referred to as nastika for rejecting the doctrine of Vedas: Jainism, Buddhism and Cārvāka.\nI'll add some Jewish sects, religious Epicureanism, Buddhism, religious Pythagoreanism, Marxism, some Egyptian cults, Confucianism, Daoism, Animism, and Deism, is this really necessary? Are people this ignorant of religious history?",

        "text": "We sense without the ability to prove all input with 100% knowledge. We forget and so have an impure memory. Therefore we are not Perfectly Ordered. Modern computers suffer the same. We do not know if this will change now.\n\nTherefore the Universe contains objects that are not Perfectly Ordered. Therefore the Universe is Random or the Universe is Perfectly Ordered to contain objects that are not Perfectly Ordered. Therefore the Universe must contain a Perfection that contains Imperfection. Therefore the Universe contains Imperfection. Therefore the Universe is Imperfect and is not Perfectly Ordered. Therefore the Universe is Not Ordered. Therefore the Universe must contain some type of Random.\n\nBut Random has a non-0 chance fitting all Ordered and all Non Ordered objects. Therefore anything in the Universe that is Ordered can be because of Random. Therefore that Random is the Universe and the Universe is that Random. Therefore the Universe is Random.\n\nBut God does not Exist. However God is said to be Always and Everywhere. But the Universe has an Always and has an Everywhere. So if God exists, God would be at every point in Space and Always Everywhere. However the Universe is Random and therefore God is Random. But God does not Exist. Therefore the Random that is the Universe does not Exist. Therefore the Universe does not Exist. Therefore the Universe that is Not Perfect does not Exist.\n\nTherefore the Universe is Perfectly Ordered. Therefore there is no God.\n\n**That was the end of the proof**. If you have read down this far without having a question in your mind that this is a proof that there is no God then you may say to the others the truth that you know that there is no God.\n\nIf you are only able to read down to one of the sentences in the proof without understanding the step by step nature of the proof, the copy and paste that sentence and explain why you are having a hard time understanding that sentence.\n\nThis is a perfect proof. So I will try to help you understand what each truth means. Once you know the step you can move on to the next sentence and repeat the process till the end when you will know there is no God.\n\nI have tried this before in r/atheism but was very dissatisfied with the lack of progress from the simple read, and copy and paste what you misunderstand till you know there is no God. The typical comment I would get reminds me of the quote \"You should do whatever it takes to live the truth, even if it means to tell a lie\".\n\nI will not lie like the members of r/atheism. This is too important. This is not about the belief that there is no God. This is a perfect truth and you will know that there is no God. This is on the same level of thought as you would have from Euclidean Geometry andor any part of Mathematics andor any part of philosophy ignoring the non-Socratic lies and week arguments that the drinking philosophers give.\n\nBe aware there is something about the mods on r/atheism that is childish and pitiful. It's like they only want to shut their ears and scream over and over that \"I DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD!!!\"\n\nYou're welcome to find the junk of these make believe atheists yourself.  I know there is no God and I hope you are able to say that too, which you should be able to after reading the text if you have not read other proofs against the existence of God which gives you knowledge.\n\nA further sorry I have to say for those who are unwilling to know. The only way something is known is if it is TRUE and you can PROVE it. This proof I assure you, will lead to true knowledge that there is no God. ",

        "text": "I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this dilemma so I'm literally just making this account so I can write this post. I hope this is the right subreddit for this. I tried finding similar posts online, but the ones I could find were about couples where one person is an atheist and one is Catholic. \n\nSome background: My fiance and I were both raised Catholic, have been baptised and confirmed. I became an atheist when I was in high school and it took many years before my immediate family followed suit. It wasn't until talking to me in his early 20s that my fiance became an atheist. Unlike my family, his family is VERRRY Catholic. Don't get me wrong, his family is super duper nice, and I couldn't ask for better in-laws, but if they knew our religious beliefs or lack thereof they might implode. Oh, and we became members of a church already because of the following dilemma...\n\nThe dilemma: We are engaged to be married and it's awesome because I want to spend the rest of my life with this man. I don't have strong opinions about our ceremony and neither does he, but obviously his family does. It was assumed we'd get married in a Catholic church, and now the ball is rolling. I'm not psyched about having a Catholic ceremony, but his parents are. I don't want to turn our wedding into a family feud, so I'm willing to go along with this. The problem is, there are some things I'm not willing to compromise on and it's hard to find information about the Catholic engagement process online for people in our situation. \n\nWe already went to the all day retreat about natural family planning where it was easy to slip under the radar. However, I've heard we must meet with a priest and a married couple who will ask us questions to make sure we can get married. I've heard things like couples having to sign a purity agreement, having to lie about living together (which we do - that was a fun when his parents found out), having to promise to raise future kids in the church, etc. These are things I'd rather not do. So my question is, on a scale from \"We're atheists, but doing this to please our parents\" to \"We love god and worship daily from our separate apartments\" what do we need to say to the priest to get through these hoops? Will a priest be understanding if we explain how important this is to his family/how honest can we get? I'd really rather not go through this whole process lying all the time.\n\nTl;dr: An atheist couple getting married in the Catholic church to please family looking for advice on how to jump through all these hoops as honestly as possible.

I waffled and hedged, because I feel guilty enough as it is - we got married and had kids assuming that we'd be on the same page with religion, and now I'm totally undermining that, so I've got a healthy dose of guilt about that.\n\nHere is my question, for anyone who has gone through this - I'm really uncomfortable and nervous having these conversations, and it makes formulating responses to what she's saying difficult at times.  Have you dealt with this, and do you know how to get over it?  Also, any tips on things that worked to mollify or help keep you and your SO together?

        "text": "Do I make sense and are my points sound?\n\nI responded to this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjGPHF5A6Po&amp;feature=share\n\nHello!\n\nI watched the video, and felt like thinking about it for a bit. Ive dealt with other arguments for theism recently, but I havent had the time to think a lot about the fine tuning argument. I wrote a lot about my thoughts on this topic below, and am still formulating my thoughts and arguments on the topic. Let me know what you think. \n\nTheres definitely a lot of ideas expressed in the video, but one of the main ideas is the fine tuning argument that has been discussed by many apologists and has been debated many times. \n\nEssentially, one of his points (if I am understanding this correctly) is that the constants in our world are so precise (meaning that if they are different then the universe wouldn't exist) that the best explanation is through God. \n\n1) The universe simply is, it isnt particularly something we can change, and we cant really correctly reason out how the universe would be if the laws were different. All the scientific laws and discoveries (and constants) come from experiments about the universe we have. Changing the universe from what it is to something else would obviously result in something that is not our universe, which we should not look at it relative to our universe. Yes, if the 4 forces outlined were different the universe would be different or even non existent, but there are sets of laws out there that could warrant a universe with different characteristics that could merit something we would call 'life'.The main ideas of the argument emphasize comparing this universe to another one, which is not a good methodology to take because a different universe will, in fact, be completely different and should be measured on its own, just like we did. We dont know other universes. \n\n2) The argument essentially argues that because the world around us is existing in this way, we it must be that the universe was made for us. The main focus of the argument from Prager University is on the universe being shaped for us, and rejects the notion that we adapted to the universe. By looking at the way things happened to come about, one could assume that it came about by some intelligent order, but at the same time that would be to put the cart before the horse. The universe existed before we did. Evolution is another important idea to my argument, but I am not sure whether you believe in it. Most Christians do believe, however, in some sort of adaptation process that occurs over time across generations referred to as micro evolution. This supports the idea that organisms adapt to their environment. Only recently with humans have we seen humans changing the environment to suit themselves, but they arent actually changing the laws of physics in this endeavor. \n\nAnother concept he shared was the idea that if constants relating to the Earth were changed, we would not have life on Earth. There are some things I would say to that as well:\n\n3) As with point 1, the argument presumes that life only works the way we see it. In reality, there is the possibility in the gigantic expanse of the universe that other types of living creatures exist that rely on things differently than we do. Humans are well adapted for Earth's conditions, and we live according to the way Earth works. On other planets, conditions might be different that would lead to different life forms that have different ways of living. As with point 1, it is not a good idea to judge the possibility for something we might call life by relating it to the conditions that humans live in today. It is possible that if the Earth were under different conditions different life forms would come to be. \n\n4) Our perspective is only ours. We see everything directly around us, but dont know everything in the universe, nor do we know what happened before us. Because we are conscious beings here, and we have not found life on other planets yet, we presume we are somehow special. This obviously relies on whether or not you believe in God but, it seems as if we are trying to focus the interpretation of the cosmos on ourselves. Its as if we are looking at a map wondering why the rivers just happened to flow on map boundaries instead of why map boundaries were put on the rivers. \n\n5) Humans have an inherent desire to create meaning in the universe, and to find patterns that are not actually there. Many people take events that have no correlation and attempt to create meaning from them. Once we have been told to look for something, we will find it in the world. I believe that this is one of the ways in which people attempt to find meaning in the universe. The argument attempts to make us feel as if we are somehow special for things turning out this way, but I think that the events simply happened to come about this way, and didnt happen that way. We ascribe importance to it because it appeals to our sense of what is reasonable and what is not and is also the only thing we can look at. There isnt anything to measure this universe against exactly. Therefore, the finetuning argument is an attempt to create meaning out of things that are not meaningful. \n\nSome links: \n\nWhy people are drawn to find meaning in things that dont have meaning:\nhttps://www.ted.com/.../michael_shermer_the_pattern...\n\nA refutation of the fine tuning argument: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDj1PzP_D1Q\n\nI think its also important to look at the first comment, as he points out how Prager University used a quote out of context for their advantage. \n\nedit: changed Hello (name)! to Hello!",

Next she asks if I am religious. I tell her I am (and thought maybe she would leave me alone). She then asks if I am Christian and I reply yes again. She then goes on to ask if I will pray for her, and I tell her I absolutely will. Next, she walks over to me and says, in a dead serious tone, that she's being terrorized by three demons and thinks she is going to hell. I paused for a second, concerned and confused by all of this. She tells me God is sending her to hell because of her demons and he has made her ugly for it. She started hugging me and almost crying in my arms. This goes on for a bit. I honestly didn't know what to say. I started thinking I was being punked or there were candid cameras hiding somewhere... This is how bizzare the encounter was. I go on to reassure her that she is beautiful and that Jesus loves her unconditionally. She finally believed me, told her I'd be praying for her, and told her to have a blessed day. It was one of the strangest run-ins I've ever had with a woman. She appeared to be sober and quite visibly shaken up for a women in her 40s. I hope I handled this in the right way. \n\nHas anyone else had a weird encounter like this by someone religious? How did it go? ",

And as most of you can guess more than half of the staff identifies as Christian and wouldn't see anything wrong with every grave having a cross. \n\nAnyways I feel like I'm rambling but we as a location serve A LOT of different faiths very frequently other than your standard Christian and of course plenty of non-religious and I can't believe they're totally fine with putting a cross on every grave that gets a flag. If I had a loved one buried here that was an Atheist or even Muslim or Jewish, I'd be furious!\n\nYou think I should say anything? I'm on really good terms with all of my managers but at the end of the day it feels like the \"good ol' boys\" club with the exception of my closest manager.",

Over my life, they have done their absolute best to raise me. They have provided me with a lot of opportunities, and even if they didn't always understand them, they supported me as I pursued  my life goals. I have no doubt in my mind that they love me. \n\nMy parents believe with all their heart in the Bible. They are extremely committed Southern Baptists. They believe everything in the Bible literally happened. They believe in salvation through Christ alone, the total depravity of mankind without God, eternal life with God after death, and- Who could forget?- Complete, eternal, horrific punishment in Hell for those who do not believe. Forever and ever Amen.\n\nMy parents don't know I'm not at all religious anymore. I haven't told them. They might suspect I've \"backslid-en\" in my faith, but nothing so unimaginable as the malignant specter of Atheism. How could they? It would of course mean that I could never be truly happy here on Earth. Without the Holy Spirit's guidance I'd float through life un-tethered, unfulfilled. Not to mention, how could a person ever make it through the day without the the support of Jesus Christ (our eternal Lord and Savior)? Worst of all, though, hell. Hell. Forever. No hope. Torture. Pain. Suffering. Wailing and Gnashing of teeth and so on.\n\nPeople like to say sometimes that Atheist are just angry at God. I'm not angry at God. I have no reason to believe he exists. I'm angry because I don't believe it is possible to have a healthy, normal relationship with my parents under all of those beliefs.",

        "text": "Generally speaking, religion has been diminishing in the developed countries for something like a hundred years now.\n\nFor example, this week we see this article -\n\n\\- http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/no-religion-outnumber-christians-england-wales-study \n\n&gt;The number of people who say they have no religion is rapidly escalating and significantly outweighs the Christian population in England and Wales, according to new analysis.\n\n&gt;The proportion of the population who identify as having no religion - referred to as \"nones\" - reached 48.5% in 2014, almost double the figure of 25% in the 2011 census. Those who define themselves as Christian - Anglicans, Catholics and other denominations - made up 43.8% of the population. ...\n\n&gt;The new analysis will fuel concern among Christian leaders about growing indifference to organised religion. This year the Church of England said it expected attendance to continue to fall for another 30 years as its congregations age and the millennial generation spurns the institutions of faith. ...\n\nAnd whenever we see an article like this, it usually includes a quote from some representative of religion saying\n\n*\"Guys, we're in real trouble here.* \n\n*\"We need to* ***do something about this.\"***\n\n&gt;**\"Churches need to take this kind of data very seriously,\"** said [researcher] Bullivant. **\"When analysing data you see patterns that you might not necessarily notice otherwise. This can flag up areas for further research or groups that need particular pastoral attention.\"**\n\nBut the problem that religions have is that their ideas are not only almost certainly wrong, but fundamentally unjustifiable - even if religious ideas should really turn out to be true, they've never been able to find any way to *show* that their ideas are really true. \n\nThus we can confidently expect that in developed countries, the percentage of religious believers is going to continue to decline, and there isn't really much that religions can do about that.\n\n. \n\nSo here's my question:\n\n***Is*** **there really anything that religions in developed countries can do about that?**\n\nIf I get in a time machine and hop ahead to 2116, is there any possibility that I'll read about the transformation that happened in the mid-21st century, \n\nresulting in a dramatic increase in the percentage of religious believers?\n\n**What if anything would religions in developed countries realistically be able to do to significantly increase the numbers of their believers over the next few decades?\"**\n\n(I'm asking this here because I'm anti-religion and I want the numbers of religious to decrease, \n\nso if the churches have any \"secret weapon\" [psychological, sociological, apologetic, whatever] that they can use to prevent that from happening, \n\nthen I want to know what that \"secret weapon\" might be so that I can help work against it.)  \n\n.\n\n(I'm trying to get serious responses here if possible, not witticisms or wild guesses about things that \"might\" happen, but almost certainly won't.)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They can use it as a loop, that every time you talk about it, they will just say: \n\n&gt;\"Well, see, you're not believing, so you're blocking it, of course you won't experience God! You're already saying you don't believe anymore, you're not even praying for the Holy Spirit anymore and you're not open for it.\"* (this sentence is not exactly what someone said, but something like this)\n\nNow when I ask how they 'see'/experience God, they often say that it's unexplainable, you'll just know. (they'll always stay vague what it exactly is)\n\n**What are your thoughts on this? And how would you respond to something like this? Is this argument an argument you can never rebute (if rebute is the right word for this) or respond to properly because it's vague and impossible to prove/disprove?**\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the responses, didn't expect so many, I'm trying to read them all. Now I got several great ways to respond to this I didnt think of before and that may show a Christian I talk to realize it isnt such a strong argument as he/she thinks it is and it may sow a seed of doubt",

He and the host are  correct in saying that exodus was important to the civil rights movement. The parallel is strong. I remember watching speeches about Malcolm x and  MLK, Jr and being moved by the parallel.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Bart forgets all the bad religion has done. I guess the crosses the KKK happened to be burning were all year round decorations for their new urban neighbors. Agendas, wars, evil waged on people by people that held sincere religious belief.\n\nWe can talk about exodus being this fanciful story for liberation and independence and that's all fine and dandy, but what about the tyrant that wants to dominate the world and references the domination of  the Canaan city states in the book of Joshua? Is that important to historical truth or not? These are people that hold sincere beliefs. I think he's doing too much of a disservice just waxing over it like its not a big concern.\n\nI find myself in the middle. I agree we can take on personal truths from the bible and cultural truths, but we really don't need to value it as much as Ehrman is suggesting We take all the good we can and forget the bad. If he's suggesting that, I think that's nonsense.",

        "text": "I'm a christian and i'm wanting some input because seriously I posted on facebook that I changed my perspectives, I used debate politics, debate religion, I used to argue with mormons to try to change their beliefs, now I came to a realization that I should stop. Maybe it's even God speaking but honestly after starting to like this one girl and thinking about my life I realized I pushed a lot of potential friends away, I annoyed people, even made like mormons sad because of my actions, yet they're STILL mormon. I realized I should just let people do what they want and I think it's important to just focus on yourself and improve yourself. So, I said something similar to that and my christian friends basically told me that \"this world isn't for our pleasure\" and stuff like that. In my head I'm thinking God, if truly loving and all knowing, he'll understand. But then i'd get a \"jesus came with sword\" etc. \n\nI just don't get it. I understand not doing hard drugs etc like some people I know and living the way I used to with just drinking &amp; smoking every night but living the way most christians want literally makes me want to be done with life. I know Jesus didn't promise happiness but is it REALLY God if your mindset is anger, stress and sadness? Whereas, now I feel much more free and motivated, still depressed about somethings but I even still I get christian friends saying stuff like \"this generation just wants__\" or some bullcrap about leftism being bad or whatever and I'm apparently now the bad guy for realizing this stuff is only temporary, even debating politics i'm done with because none of it makes me happy. \n\nMaybe i'm just rambling but basically why do you think so? I know why christians think so from a biblical perspective but there HAS to be something more. I could NEVER tell someone to NOT try to improve themselves, especially if they're already experiencing troubles. It's like they want me to be content with having a shitty life and yet even when I pray and do what they tell me, I return with my SAME answer but somehow it's still wrong.",
