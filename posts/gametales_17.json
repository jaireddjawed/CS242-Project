        "text": "Hey guys. I was recently going through and linking a bunch of stories for someone who just got into reading tabletop stories. One of them, which I had an imgur link saved for, no longer seems to be accessible through imgur. I was wondering of anyone might have a screenshot of it saved somewhere or knows another place to get the story from.\n\nI believe the general summary of the story was some space marines were evacuating a planet or something and one got split off from the group while trying to make it to the last transport off world. He ended up running into some big baddie from the Warhammer universe and ended up killing him with a brick due to insane luck. The story has been posted on r/gametales before as both [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4lc2pi/dark_heresy_quite_the_holy_brick/) and on /r/dndgreentext as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/21j7h5/the_emperors_holy_brick/).\n\nThanks in advance if anyone happens to find or have the story, and I wish happy holidays to all.",

        "text": "###Merry Christmas!\n\n*Firstly, I’m really sorry that it’s taken this long to update. I’ve been spending a lot of time in the entertainment biz and dealing with a lot of life stress recently, so I’ve been procrastinating doing a writeup of the last adventure.*\n\n*If it makes you feel any better, try comparing it to the Bible’s release schedule. God still hasn’t given us part 3 and some guy named Joseph Smith had to start writing fanfiction.*\n\n*But, without any further ado, welcome back to* ***Jesus plays Pathfinder!***\n\n---\n\n#\"You silly king!\"\n\nWhen last we left off, my joke of a character had managed to quote at least a dozen Bible verses, craft a crown of thorns, become a master carpenter, and be named G. Zuss, without anybody getting the joke. The girl that sits next to me, the on-and-off player of the elf wizard Tessa, is in on the whole thing (mostly because I forgot she was part of the group when I told her the story). The friend who invited me, Orcbro, had ascended from player to DM, while the DM had stepped down to playing a weird Frenchman character. Orcbro’s wife was still a druid slyph, and the two murderhobos were still obsessed with doing absolutely everything Jesus would not do. \n\nIn other words, this was gonna be good.\n\nWe all awoke from the recovery rest after the last encounter, a terrifying undead Devourer. This time, G. Zuss awoke with a complete list of crafted magical items that his player had decided upon, with the help of the commenters from the installment: Magnetist’s Gloves (for disarming enemies in the name of peace), a Lion’s Cloak (mostly because they didn’t have a Lamb’s Cloak), Boundary Chalk (for those “get behind me, Satan!” moments), three Stubborn Nails (do I need to explain?), nine Bandages of Rapid Recovery (I’ll bet if you wrap a dead guy in these for three days, he’d come right back to life!), a Shawl of Life-Keeping (Stores HP in the tassel of the fabric. Obscure Bible story for y’all.), and a Metamagic Wand that my heavenly DM had gifted to me a few sessions ago that extends the range of touch spells to 30 ft. \n\nWe were able to continue along the road toward our destination without running into any more giant undead or freak thorns, for we chose the path that our DM had set out for us. Before long, we had arrived in a major hold of this French kingdom--Arlin Dilon welcomed us to his hometown as the players shoved their way past the guards. When we got inside, we realized that everyone had a French accent. \n\nPrezzel tried to order baguettes. \n\nThe first thing that was immediately obvious was that this was a city ravaged by war. Homeless people and refugees lined the streets, and both blood and weapons were everywhere. But the first thing that caught our druid’s attention was the gigantic tree in the courtyard, split down the middle and obviously dying. \n\nYes, the tree was a symbol of the city as a whole, and yes, many Minas Tirith jokes were made. \n\nBut the part that caught my character’s attention was the sick and lame on the streets. Something deep inside him knew that this is where he needed to be. Zuss left the party to find the center of despair and poverty, a warehouse that had been converted into temporary living (and dying) quarters for those who were fleeing this war. \n\nAt first, I merely healed each of them. Then, as they began to ask who I was, I told them. \n\n“I am a servant of Sarenrae, a giver of life and peace. I am going out into all the world to preach the gospel of love and hope.”\n\nOnce I had their attention, it was parable time.\n\n“That tree in the center of your city...it has been broken and destroyed. And you have been broken with it. Earthly symbols of unity wither and fade, but the one thing that does not fade is the spiritual force of light and love. Do not graft yourself to the things of this world, but instead graft yourself to my tree. Become part of my people. Join me, and together, we can change the world for the better.” \n\nAnd with that, I divided all of the gold I had remaining and gave it to the people gaping open-mouthed. And I let the dice do the rest. \n\nAs it turns out, rolling a 2 isn’t a problem when you have circumstance bonuses and a standing +15 to any Diplomacy check.\n\n---\n\n#Take Up Your Cross\n\nThe DM, Orcbro, sighed and said that out of the 13 people actively listening, 11 had just decided to become my followers. \n\nBoth in-game and out of game, the murderhobo players exploded with anger. \n\nI had to rush Zuss and his new disciples to the military headquarters so that the following conversation could still take place in the game world. \n\n“The hell??” said Prezzel, caught somewhere between incredulity and amusement. “You can’t drag civilians into combat.”\n\n“They’re under my protection,” Zuss said. “It’s part of my mission to raise up new followers of my faith.”\n\n“All right, listen up!” Perry stood up and shouted to the ragged crowd of people shuffling awkwardly outside. “You aren’t allowed to join us. What I say goes--and you aren’t.”\n\nA quick versus roll of Leadership determined that was not the case.\n\n“Okay,” Perry said, spinning on the spot, still shouting. “You’re out of the contract. Come on!” He produced the piece of paper that had me signed on as an independent contractor. Zuss shrugged and scrawled an affirming signature. He didn’t have much use for oaths anyway--he preferred to \"let his yes be yes and his no be no.\" Perry snatched the original contract and tore it into tiny pieces, nodding.\n\n“Now get rid of these people, or I’ll do it for you!” \n\n“I cannot. We are part of the same spiritual family now. We travel together.”\n\n“Look,” Prezzel said, still halfway laughing, “Do they have any skills at all?”\n\nI told them that seven of them were fishermen, one was a priest, one was a doctor, one was a treasurer, and one was a tax collector. I decided not to give away their names just yet. \n\nPerry threw up his hands. “They’re cannon fodder! You are leading these people to their deaths! YOU ALL WILL DIE!” he shouted over his shoulder at them. \n\nAnother skill check. Another pass. My people had faith in me. \n\nBy now, Perry’s player and character were both red in the face. “I order you to let your people go! I am your commanding officer!!” \n\nI shrugged and pointed to the contract that he had torn up seconds earlier. “Not anymore.” \n\nHe nearly had an aneurysm. \n\n“I have been giving my healing services on my own terms--for free--anyway. What are you going to do if I continue to journey with you, force me to stop healing people?”\n\n“If it comes down to it,” Perry growled, fingers conjuring a spell. \n\nPrezzel put a hand on Perry’s shoulder. \n\n“Hey man, why don’t we just split off, okay? We go do our mission and let Zuss have his...sidequest thing.”\n\nPerry took a deep breath and nodded. \n\n“Okay. Fine. Let’s go, everyone.”\n\nThe other players looked at each other. There was a silent conversation that I didn’t catch at the time, but someone explained to me after the game. Basically, Khastin wasn’t the martial type and thought that Zuss had the right idea, while Arlin Dilon was sufficiently impressed with Zuss’s refusal to call him a coward (or metagame). Tessa’s player was absent, but she had told me that she wanted to continue following G. Zuss to see what antics he got up to. In other words, Perry would be spinning off from Zuss, not the other way around. \n\nFortunately, at that moment, Arlin Dilon stepped in. \n\n“Zeez conversation eez pointless anyway, mah friends. There eez a clause in ze contract zat says zat zere must be a clerick in ze party at all times!”\n\nWe exchanged glances. Zuss had practically memorized the thing, thanks to a Nat 20 skill check. There was no such clause. \n\nPerry’s player performed every bluff and sense motive check he had available. But whatever ungodly stats Arlin possessed gave him no chance. \n\n“Fine,” Perry sighed. “We keep the cleric. But there’s no way his people travel with us.”\n\nIn the end, we compromised. Since theoretically we were leading them out of vagrancy in order to reclaim a home, the party would travel a day ahead of them to scout and clear the way. Once we found a suitable village, they would settle, rebuild, and form a new community. \n\nMaybe it would be in Utah. \n\n---\n\n#The Path of the Righteous\n\nWe set off early the next day to the town of Bûcheron. The previous “Shield,” or military captain of Magisteaux, had gone missing there some days ago, and our party’s mission was to investigate and report back. \n\nAnd avoid Nazis. Did I mention the Nazis?\n\nWhen dusk fell on the trail, we made camp, making sure to avoid the patches of unnatural thorns that lined the road. Zuss had second watch.\n\nFortunately, he had saved his lantern oil, and his light did not go out before the important stuff happened. \n\nSomething began moving in the bushes deep within the thorns, irregularly stumbling around. Zuss decided that being a pacifist made him ill-equipped to respond to a threat, and woke up Prezzel, our toughest warrior.\n\nSaid the shepherd-man to the mighty warrior: “Do you hear what I hear?”\n\nIt was a child, a child, shivering in the cold. \n\nWe didn’t bring him silver and gold, but we brought him to the firelight. He was covered in innumerable cuts and scratches, as if he had been running headlong through the brambles without any regard for covering himself. His eyes were hollow and blank. \n\nThe rest of the party, awoken by the commotion, crowded around the kid and began drilling him. What happened? Who are you? Why are you out here? Where did you come from? Where are your parents? \n\nThe boy covered his ears and began to rock in place, whimpering about the voices hurting him. Zuss reached his arms out and raised his voice for the first time. \n\n“If you don’t mind, everyone! Peace! I think we just need a moment.”\n\nZuss channeled positive energy, and some of the boy’s cuts began to close. He kneeled in close and in as gentle a voice he could muster, said, “You are safe, my child. My name is Zuss. What is yours?”\n\nThe child muttered something that sounded like Michael. The party began to all speak at once again, but Zuss cut them off with a sharp glance. Suffer the little children to come onto me. Let them speak. \n\n“Daddy tried to get to me, but mommy stopped me. Daddy said he was hungry. He tried to get through the door, but mommy closed the door on him. We all ran to the church. Daddy wasn’t far behind. And he had all of his friends with him. We ran and ran and locked ourselves in. We tried to hide, but Mrs. Duboi’s baby wouldn’t stop crying. So she slammed her baby up against the wall, over and over, and she stopped crying. Then Daddy’s friends started running into the church, and my uncle threw me out the window and told me to run and never stop for anything. And then he started screaming...”\n\nOrcbro had delivered this entire monologue in a monotone whimper, staring into space without a pause for breath. The players gathered around the table were each frozen in absolute horror. \n\nThen the pin dropped, and everyone simultaneously said, “We go. Now.”\n\nThere was no packing up, no putting out the campfire. Arlin didn’t even put his armor on. \n\n“We can’t leave the kid alone in the woods!” Perry said, already on his horse. \n\n“I know,” G. Zuss said from atop his donkey. “If only we had 11 or so followers right now.” \n\nIn the end, we had to leave Khastin’s pet sloth and bear to guard the child, while we set off at a hard gallop down the road. \n\nBûcheron was still about 6 hours away on horseback. We managed to cut that time in half. It was only sheer luck that Zuss had the ability to remove the Fatigued status as part of his Community domain, or else the following scene would have been even more deadly...\n\nFire and corpses. \n\n---\n\n#Hell on Earth\n\nThat was what we saw as we approached the town limits at the small hours of the morning. The church that the boy had described was spattered with blood across its doors and illuminated by the burning buildings adjacent to it. Upon its threshold was a tall man in robes, conducting the chaos like an orchestra. Bodies dragged other bodies into the church. A skeletal Morgh slithered its intestinal tongue around the remaining corpses, bringing them to jittery, quaking life. \n\nThe good news is that for the first time, the party was united under a common ideal: “This is bad.”\nWe decided to put all of our power into a literal spearpoint, and buffed Prezzel and his horse with everything we had. Expeditious Retreat, Bless, Shield Other. \n\nOut of the darkness, a madman with a trident came barreling through the sea of zombies, throwing a handwoven net onto the Morgh. Hopelessly tangled, the Morgh was yanked off of its feet by the still-moving horse, as Prezzel turned around in the saddle and skewered it with his trident. \n\nHe ended up rolling a 45 to hit. Needless to say, he did some damage. \n\nSo when the Morgh shrugged it off and pulled Prezzel off his horse with his own trident, we knew that it was time to enter the fray ourselves. \n\nThe following fight was as bloody as it was chaotic. Perry, our squishy caster, jumped off his horse and activated an Immovable Rod in midair, hanging from above and blasting zombies down below with gouts of flame and Eldritch Blasts. Khastin transformed back into an enormous bear and summoned several smaller elementals to attack the necromancer from all sides. Arlin Dilon vanished almost instantly into the night in a puff of cowardice. And Zuss just galloped around on his donkey, trying to area-heal everyone--and stay alive long enough to keep absorbing half of Prezzel’s damage through the Shield Other spell.\n\nThe last part became only more difficult as Prezz's  duel raged on. The Morgh, thirsty for vengeance against the surprise attack, wrapped its entrails around the trident and ripped it from Prezzel’s grasp. Prezzel found himself fighting off zombies with his bare hands, and Gabby Z felt every bite. \n\nOne particularly spectacular blast from Perry sent skeleton shards flying in every direction. As if blessed by Thor himself, a bone spiraled through the night air and landed smack into Prezzel’s outstretched palm. (It’s my personal opinion that it was a donkey jawbone.) We were back in business. \n\nSuddenly, every corpse within 50 feet suddenly became acutely aware of the presence of a cleric in their midst. \n\nBefore long, Zuss was completely surrounded by zombies. The horde began tearing at his flesh and the flesh of his donkey, almost instantly bringing both down to the negatives. \n\nAs we fell, out of nowhere, Arlin Dilon swooped out of the shadows to catch Zuss and drag him away from the swarm ravenously devouring the donkey. Arlin blew a Hero Action to hit Zuss with a healing wand twice. But within seconds, the hateful zombies tore into Zuss’s flesh again, rendering him unconscious once more. \n\nArlin stood up, seeing that the rest of the party was too far away to lend aid. Restraining every cowardly urge in his body, he flicked a pair of throwing knives into his hands and spread his arms wide. \n\n“HEY YOU!” he shouted at the largest of the undead (in his decidedly un-intimidating French accent). “COME AND GET SOME!” \n\nA lumbering corpse leapt over Zuss’s body and charged Arlin. Arlin squeezed his eyes tight, threw the knives with all of his might, and attempted to dodge out of the way before the beast reached him. When the dust settled, Arlin was standing. The zombie was not. \n\nNeither were the rest of the zombies. The rest of the party looked at Arlin from across the silent field.\n\n“I got one,” he said weakly, before collapsing into a faint. \n\nOnly Zuss could hear what happened next, partially because no one expected him to be conscious. As it turns out, a Shawl of Life-Keeping is a great investment. As Arlin slumped to the ground, feigning weariness, he muttered to himself “I am never doing that again.” Without an accent of any kind. \n\nZuss couldn’t help it. “Thank you for being the Samaritan that stopped to help.”\n\nArlin was shocked. But this was a conversation to wait for later. \n\nKhastin transformed herself into a bird to fly off and inform the followers about the child we had left behind in such a rush. Perhaps they could take care of him while we cleaned up around the church. \n\nG. Zuss was barely able to stand. But that wasn’t about to stop him from performing last rites for the dead. He began with the Necromancer in the center of the carnage. An elderly human in black and grey robes, wearing a pendant of seven stones. Six of those stones were glowing green. \n\nZuss thought for a moment. This was obviously an artifact of great evil. Leaving it here for a bandit to claim would be a grave mistake. Giving it to Perry or Prezzel would be an even bigger one. G. Zuss reached out and yanked the pendant off of the necromancer’s body. \n\nInstantly, a beam of green light shot into the sky and every stone on the pendant lit up. Gabbatha Zuss felt a tremendous force of evil pull on his soul and fill it up. \n\nOrcbro smiled evilly and told me to add Animate Undead and Raise Undead to my spell list. \n\n##To be continued\n\n##[Previous installment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4glsy6/jesus_plays_pathfinder_part_2/)",

        "text": "I really had fun with this because I haven't been able to do much tabletop gaming in my life.\n\nOur group consists of myself, a half orc warlock named Kol'Roc, Status an eleven (drunken) monk, and Geoffrey, a suspicious human who hasn't quite settled on a class.\n\nWe were investigating the disappearance of multiple knights at a nearby shrine when we got jumped and taken to some prison cells. After some pretty funny attempts to escape, which succeeded though not before Status was knocked out. As we searched for our belongings we found a torture chamber, defeated a few more guards and the actual torturer.\n\nOnce we were safe enough to catch our breath we searched the room and discovered a secret door that led to a magically trapped room, which also summoned a pair of skeletons. Thankfully we quickly dispatched them. With both of my friends deep in the newly cleared room, the main entrance to the torture chamber swung open. An ashen faced female guard stood, probably fearful at all the blood and gore filling the room she had come from and the one she was entering.\n\nHaving never truly had the opportunity to avoid the fighting I thought this was a prime opportunity. My character is fairly charismatic, but lacks intelligence or wisdom. He was also a bandit before being hired on for this job, this made me (OOC I mean) think that he wouldn't subtly lie to her, he'd just scare her.\n\nKol'Roc storms up to the guard who is still trying to process what she is seeing. He gestures at his friends, hoping they understood he wanted them to stay out of sight.\n\n\"What are you doing here?! Were you summoned?!\" Kol'Roc bellows.\n\n\"I-it is time for the change of guard. And the dead men made me-\"\n\n\"THEY WERE TRAITORS! ARE YOU WITH THEM?! YOU SEE WHERE THEY ENDED UP!\"\n\n\"No no of course not, but who are you?\"\n\n\"If you don't know then you need not worry. Now go back to your patrol, report nothing odd, and say nothing to anyone of what you've seen.\"\n\nThe guard nods, turns on her heels and walks away. The door slams and the lock rings as it is snapped closed.\n\nMy DM had me roll two or three checks through the whole exchange and while I didn't roll exceptionally, we are low level and I think he was just happy not to have to go through another fight.\n\nWe ended our session there because it had gotten late.\n\nIn retrospect there were done things I could have done that may have helped, like prepping a spell behind my back and showing it to her. My character is an unhappy servant of Azmodeus, though he does like the abilities he provides. This makes everything he uses magically blacker than pitch, and I think that may have helped with the intimidation factor.  It also makes me want to swap a cantrip for Presdegitation (spelling on mobile sucks) because that could have been great for RP as well.\n\nHappy gaming",

        "text": "Alright, so a few months ago I posted a story from the same campaign this takes place in (with a different party, it was a multi-table gig for a while until the commitment became too much for our GM), located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/52b2sc/dd_5e_when_my_dms_tolerance_for_stupidity_and/). \n\nAnywho, that provides most of the background for the characters involved -- in this case, I've switched over to the primary table with the Lizardman Fighter (Chuundar), the Drow Wizard (Illztdaer), and the Human Paladin (Wymer). I play an Elf Rogue named Szollos, and since I've moved in with them I've had to constantly disguise my race since if the Troglodyte discovers I'm an elf he'll try to kill me. Now, as players, Chuundar has assured me that he will deliberately try not to discover that I'm an elf, since neither of us wants him to die horribly. Unfortunately, in our last session, an unintentional loophole in the disguise I've been wearing almost led to such an outcome. The story goes like this:\n\nWe're in the Underdark (typical), searching for Chuundar's father, who seems to be the primary antagonist at the time and is tied into pretty much everyone's backstories. Our current task is to obtain the blessings of the masters of three of the four elemental embassies, which are located around a fairly massive settlement of duergar and svirfneblin, so we can proceed to the next layer (the idea being a session for each embassy). This past session we focused on the Embassy of Air, at which the master had gone insane following an accident that led to the death of his son and an ensuing haunting. After heading in, we had several encounters with ghosts that didn't seem to do anything but stare at us - one was a young boy, and the other a young girl. It came to a point where we were in a room with a glass wall in the middle of it; on the other side was an identical room, and inside it was the ghost girl.\n\nWhile previous encounters with the girl had led to her ignoring us or staring at us and moving through objects, this one had her mimicking our every move. When Wymer asked me if the girl was staring at and mimicking me or him, and I told him she was clearly focused on me, he immediately attacked the glass; surprisingly enough, he rolled a crit and gained a hit point per the abilities of his weapon. Although it didn't break, the glass turned a deep black and revealed the true form of the ghost -- a roiling, gelatinous mass of air and fury that swiftly left. Curious and slightly alarmed, I left the room while the others were distracted and found my way into the other side with Wymer.\n\nNow, my GM didn't intend for things to happen this way, but there's been a unicorn travelling with the party since very early on, and a bearded devil that's been a major plot device for me since I was in the other table's group. When the two of us joined the new group, there was an immediate confrontation where my bearded ally told me that the unicorn was actually a chain devil, and his direct superior. Unfortunately, since Chuundar is a total idiot, he just thought I hated unicorns and didn't see anything weird with the fact that it only talked to him, it loved killing and torturing elves, and it got its jollies off of pain, so I couldn't just go killing the damn thing. On the plus side, because of the nature of the room, while I was on the other side I could see the unicorn's true form.\n\nThat was a lot of background, but here comes the kicker. As soon as I walked into the other room, the GM had Chuundar and I roll Perception and Deception checks, respectively, with Chuundar rolling first. He rolled a 19 with a +2 bonus for a total of 21. Of all the times to roll high, he had to do it on the one time I was in danger of having to fight him off.... Lucky for me, I managed a natural 20. As a result, of course, he saw nothing at all through the mirror and apparently believes my true nature to be pure shadow (it works anyway with my +10 Initiative bonus; they never see me coming).",

        "text": "So, We were playing some Dungeons and Dragons 5e tonight, and my sister wrote up some of the highlights that happened during it and posted it on Facebook. I thought this would be a good place to post it, so here it goes :\n\nTonight on [Our last name] D&amp;D!\nFeaturing:\n-[My sister] as Ame\n-[My little sister] as Salazi\n-[Me] as the Dm*\n-[My dad] as Duck\n-[My mom] as Vermillion\n-[My little brother] as Chi'buster\n------------------------------------------\n-The newbie bard \"Duck\" tries to run off** with a map in hopes it leads to a \"shawm\", an old-fashioned clarinet. [My sister] tr[ies] to search the Internet IRL, spelling it \"shom\", and come up with some medical place. Much laughter ensues.\n-Infighting happens! Vermillion, a mage, tries to mess with Duck. Duck retaliates with Dancing Lights. Salazi tries to break them up. Ame is done with everything.\n-\"Where are my dice?\" / \"They're behind your netbook.\"\n-An exasperated DM: \"Why would you want to climb the walls!?\"\n-Duck climbs on an angel fountain, breaks it, and gets struck by lightning.\n-Vermillion: \"I grab Duck by the scruff of the neck.\" / \"Darn, I was gonna start running!\" / \"I KNOW.\"\n-\"I apologize for letting him go.\"\n-\"You find a bit of gold. It's one piece.\" / \"Hah! Literally a bit***!\"\n-(in utter sarcasm) \"Yes! I rolled a 1!\"\n-DM: \"You see a pigman walking toward you. He has a strange mask and a hook.\" / Salazi: \"Pirate.\" / Ame: \"We are the pyyy-raaaates, who don't do anythiiiiing!\"\n-Duck: \"I turn around and run away, screaming, 'PIGMAN!'\" / DM: \"You don't even get a stealth check. THEY HEAR YOU.\" / \"Well, that's the point-OH, you mean the PIGMEN!\"\n-Salazi: \"I didn't mean it to sound angry.\" / DM: \"Yes, I will be the angry.\"\n-DM: \"You're hitting one of the slashers.\" / Ame: \"The pirates?\" / DM: \"...yes.\"\n-DM: \"His mask actually looks like a gas mask, but you don't know that, since gas masks don't exist here.\"\n-Vermillion: \"I hit him with Fireball.\" / DM: \"Roasted bacon!\"\n-DM (addressing Duck): \"Do you want to take one of the masks?\" / Ame: \"Why?\" / DM: *shrug* \"It looks cool.\"\n-DM: \"...considering the pigmen rolled a 1 on perception.\" / Duck: \"Ooh, that reminds me!\" *goes back and gets a small, crude drum from the previous room*\n-DM: \"Roll for perception to see if there's stew.\"\n-\"Chi'buster's going furniture shopping!\"\n-DM, to himself: \"I thought I was the plot-derailer****.\"\n-Duck: \"I set the table on fire.\"\n-DM: \"You see a pile of dirt.\" / Duck: \"I've learned! I'm not touching it!\" / Vermillion: \"I'm surprised.\"\n-DM: \"You find a pile of bones.\" / Ame: \"I will loot the bones!\" / DM: \"You must have a psychic connection. You're out in the hall.\"\n-Me: \"...(something)-EEK! Stop sneaking up on me!\" / Bunny: *runs away*\n-DM: \"You see more pigmen.\" / Duck: \"I put on the gladatorial mask, pull myself as straight as I can, and stride out saying...\" *proceeds to make ridiculous snorting noises* / DM: \"...you fool them into thinking you are a crazed pigman. They ignore you.\"\n-Chi'buster: *gets a critical from behind* / Dad: *bursts out laughing, points at me* \"Isn't the rogue supposed to hit from behind?\" *****\n-Ame: *rolls dice* \"My roll to hit is 35.\"\n-Chi'buster: \"I'll share half of what I get with Salazi.\" / DM: \"You get one gold piece each.\"\n-Vermillion: \"We can sing! 'I've been working on the rubble, all the live-long day...\"\n-Duck: \"I put on the mask, start beating the drum, and march boldly in, beating the drum and snorting!\"\n-DM: \"[The wretch] actually succeeds at the wisdom check.\" / Dad: \"The WRETCH?\" / DM: \"He got a nineteen.\" / Dad (sounding EXACTLY like Tadashi in BH6): \"Unbelievable.\"\n-Duck: \"Rats.\" / Salazi: \"No, it's a pig.\"\n-DM: \"Duck, your turn. Time to ruin more of my stuff.\"\n-Ame: \"I shoot at the gladiator.\" / DM: / \"Please miss.\" / \"22.\" / \"Roll for damage. Please roll less than a five.\" / \"8.\"\n-------------------------------------------\n*He bases his campaigns off of a game called Darkest Dungeon. Pigmen are not standard fare, especially not with gas masks.\n**He's not like this IRL.\n***A gold piece was sometimes called a bit.\n****When the DM plays as a character, he's a golden retriever of a dark elf bard/sorcerer named Quorian. Honestly, [She doesn't] know how people are scared of him, he's a GOOF who picks up everything he finds interesting and (often) puts it back down. And has an unhealthy obsession with \"Wild Magic Surge\", which has a random effect.\n*****Chi'buster is a DWARVEN CLERIC. He's not usually sneaky. [My sister] play[s] rogues every time [she] play[s] an RPG. [My sister is] a sneaky rogue. Seriously, [Her] stealth is +11.\n\n",

        "text": "A player who (let's be honest, the guy was not the brightest) was playing in our group for a couple of years, and was a generally pretty cool guy. \n\nHis character got involved with some angry Dwarves that were about to go to war due several failed business deals. This was due to the rules of a new treaty in the land they were doing a lot of business now preventing non-natives from doing business. The player got the idea of trying to help them out himself. \n\nPlayer: \"I want to go to the Dwarves and buy all their Ledger.\" \n\nThe group: \"You want all of their Ledgers? You cannot just buy those\"\n\nMe: \"But you would know where they keep them. You got those shadow powers you never use, you could pretty easily sneak and grab it.\"\n\nPlayer: \"Ok, sure. (several daring rolls later)...I take the Ledger and give it to our merchant contacts, and have them sell everything at the best rate possible...these merchants are supposed to be amazing right?\" \n\nMe: \"Yeah, your merchant buds are the ones that get a pass on the tariffs so they make bank.\" \n\n(group stares at him dumb founded, wondering why he would be so actively trying to fuck over the struggling Dwarven clansmen we were trying to help) \n\nMe: \"I describe the Dwarves going crazy.....all the clans panicking about their ledgers being stolen, and the merchants cackling in glee.\"\n\nPlayer: \"The merchants are paying, at a good price, for all the Ledger right?\" \n\nMe: \"Oh, yeah they pay you up front a good amount, and will offer enough cut to make you retire a very wealthy man.\"\n\n(group cannot believe he has done this)\n\nPlayer: \"Ok, now that we have sold all their Ledger for them, I bring the Dwarves the money and the contract for the ongoing sales from the merchants.\"\n\n(group flabbergasted)\n\nMe: \"Ummm, ok. The Dwarves scream and curse at you for about an hour breaking down in tears at your betrayal, then lead you away to a cell.\" \n\nPlayer: \"It was a good price right? (Yes) Alright, they will calm down once they count the coin I gave them.\" \n\nMe: \"The next day the constable lays out the case about you stealing the Ledgers, and that you admitted to it all in front of everyone. You are sentenced to execution. (rough laws here)\"\n\nPlayer: \"What, seriously?  I sold it at a good price, a better one than could, especially when they could not sell it all, we need to just sit down and have a drink of your Ledger and talk through this!\"\n\n(many confused looks)\n\nMe: \"Drink the Ledger? What?\"\n\nPlayer: \"Yeah, I said I set aside some of the Ledger for myself. Let's have a glass and enjoy the profits!\"\n\nMe: (everyone laughing hard) \"What do you think \"Ledger\" is?\" \n\nPlayer: (hesitantly) \"A type of beer\"\n\nMe: \"Wait, wait, everyone wait! (goes to grab a dictionary) Please look up the word Lager....ok, now the word Ledger.\" \n\nPlayer: \"oh!....well, you know what I mean!\"\n\n(as a group, NO WE DON'T)\n\nTL;DR Player got Ledger and Lager confused. Thought he stole the Dwarves beer and sold it for them, when they could not. We all just sat there wondering why he stole all the Dwarven merchants accounting books and sold them to their rivals. ",

        "text": "Part one of Chronicles of Heroes. I recommend reading [prologue](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4zlar5/dungeon_worldchronicles_of_heroes_intro/), as I've made an modest synposis of our setting there. I suggest reading it, but I pasted the most relevant paragraph below:\n\nOur heroes all live in city of Bazaar. The city is home of a heroes guild called, just because we could not find a better name, Shield,  led by paladin named Lotheris (big, black bald guy, without an eyepatch, for now) and it has loads of personnel, most of it PCs. Think Fairy Tail, but with less wizards and more kickass.\n\n&gt; our party for tonight's entertainment: F, the entreprenous Beguiler, Sionnach, brave redheaded druid, Yugo the Eliatrope, and Shaggy, the City Thief\n\n&gt; during previous, less eventful session, we've found and briefly fought two murderous cults in the city. Sionnach knows the leader of one of them, renegade druid Leonardo (hence Al-Druida, those guys are magical terrorist PETA) and F was commisioned by a local crimelord to stop the other (power hungry necromancers).\n\n&gt; Sionnach, along with Yugo and Shaggy is sitting in common room in Shield HQ,  wondering what to do with renegade druid\n\n&gt; F stroms into the room, locks every lock, checks chimney, pulls the curtains down and sighs with slight relief\n\n&gt; \"zombie assasins, we need to get out of town atleast for a day or I am dead\"\n\n&gt; it's decided, we go to check recent sightings of terrorist druids\n\n&gt; we get to a large steadhold, freshly after attack: mercenary guards on high alert (they quickly saw through F's illusions as he attempted to do some disguises), some elven rangers/druids are hanging from nearby gallows, and as Sionnach feels that nearby forest spirits are afraid\n\n&gt; Mercenaries are ready to shank suspicious as hell Beguiler, only Sionnach manages to talk them out of it. They are taken to meet lady of the house, lady Amber.\n\n&gt; in short, druids killed her husband and son, she's preparing to gas the forest and every living thing there, but is willing to send heroes forward to scout for her mercs. One condition: one of us has to magically sign a binding contract not to let Leonardo, their main target, alive.\n\n&gt; F and Sionnach are hesistant, Yugo calmly sings.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile Shaggy infiltrates steadhold's laboratory, like fantasy equivalent of Sam Fisher or Snake, steals recipe for the posionous gas, sabotages production line and runs. Collaterals: 20 men and fire.\n\n&gt; Party meets again in the forest, Sionnach turns into bear (owl?) or something and uses her smell to find a trail.\n\n&gt; after some time they are attacked by a some vile branches, a druid and elven ranger.\n\n&gt; half an hour later Sionnach, Yugo and Shaggy are tied together and led by the druid Vaydark towards Al-Druida encampment. You see, these eco-terrorists have magic at their disposal and are going to summon extremely powerful fire demon to do their bidding (the bidding meaning \"burn the whole damn city down\"). \n\n&gt; Druid is challenged by a sentry near the cave, a heavily armed human warrior. He answers with correct passwords and they both lead their captives into darkness, with warrior leading the way.\n\n&gt; After some time they enter, through a wide corridor, into a large cavern. It's an underground garden. Among the trees, next to a stream, there is a summoning circle on the floor with three distinct spots. Working on it are Leonardo and his two elven compatriots. \n\n&gt; „We've ambushed them in the forest, killed one of them, the girl says she knows you”, says Vaydark.\n\n&gt;  Leonardo welcomes them warmly, says he thinks fondly of Sionnach and well, they will need human sacrifices to boost the ritual. „Would you kindly put them into their places, Vaydark?”\n\n&gt; Ritual is underway, collected power is getting greater with every passing moment. Nearing the peak, Leonardo pulls out a sacrifical dagger and stands behind Sionnach. Two of his fellows are preparing to kill Yugo and Shaggy.\n\n&gt; At this very moment hell breaks loose.\n\n&gt; Captive heroes break their bonds.\n\n&gt; Vaydark jumps at human warrior and changes into very big (seriously, the bears are smaller) wolf\n\n&gt; Pause.\n\n&gt; mission_impossible_theme.mp3\n\n&gt; A good con doesn't just happen.\n\n&gt; It's all about the setup.\n\n&gt; Let's rewind half an hour.\n\n&gt; Party is ambushed by plant-controlling druid Vaydark and his ranger companion on a tree.\n\n&gt; Sionnach and Shaggy took on the druid and after brief struggle (involving throwing daggers and plant bending) subdued him\n\n&gt; F transformed himself into a raven, flew to  ranger, threw him down. Yugo, being Star Mage, briefly amplified the gravity for ranger. Imagine loud thud!\n\n&gt; F interrogated the ranger using his hypnotic command, got every bit of info he could from him, then in flash of yellow light changed is appearance into Vaydark. \n\n&gt; back to the present\n\n&gt; while wolves need no armor, people attacked by them should have some armor at their throats\n\n&gt; Human warrior dies a gory death, other members of Al-Druida fare no better\n\n&gt; Yugo uses his portals to swap one druid with about-to-have-his-throat-sliced Shaggy\n\n&gt; The Thief finishes off teamkiller\n\n&gt; meanwhile Sionnach and Leonardo have intense druid duel, with shapeshifting and counter-shapeshifting mixed with summoning lesser elemental spirits\n\n&gt; Redhead gains upper hand, Leonardo is casted deeper within the cave\n\n&gt; one problem: ritual was still working, even more so because our party were the ones killing and spilling blood\n\n&gt; there is angry fire demon coming this way\n\n&gt; column of fire enters the room\n\n&gt; Sionnach challenges it before F can bind the demon to himself (as he originally planned without party knowledge)\n\n&gt; Our Druid attempts to bind herself with the demon\n\n&gt; this is when time is at crossroads, suffice to say, we've taken the right way\n\n&gt; Sionnach barely (rolls 7) manages to claim the demon, Candelius, as her partner and familiar, changes into fiery angel of inferno\n\n&gt; Leonardo melts\n\n&gt; our four escape the cavern before it collapses on our heads\n\n&gt; evil cult stopped, monetary reward acquired, party stronger by virtue of having demon fire\n\n&gt; what will happen with necromancers cult? where does the left path of time lead? What the hell is F? what other adventures will other heroes of Shield have? Find out in the next episodes of Chronicles of Heroes!",

        "text": "[Previous Entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4tm4dj/dnd_5e_i_wash_your_back_you_wash_mine/)\n\nLana began to explain, in near truths, to Rin what had happened after they parted ways yesterday. After agreeing to wash each other’s backs, Lana left Rin on a promise they’d meet up at the Magic Flute later when she needed to get her things. It so happened that she ran into ‘old friends’ who asked if she’d assist them with a job. The truth was she over heard two men talking about their guild. Needing protection and wanting to accomplish her justice upon Barut, she persuaded the men to her plight.\n\nThere was the one, tall, blonde like her, with sky blue eyes named Sylis and the other with dark hair and with sharp features named Shadar. Sylis was wrapped around Lana’s fingers from the moment he saw her. Shadar took more convincing. In the end, they made an attempt to take Barut, but to no victory. Lana woke on the floor of the Inn, pain aching throughout her body, a weight forming as she realized her mortality and brashness.\n\nIt bothered her so much that the next morning, she left the men without a goodbye to pay her mother’s grave a visit. What had been a peaceful visit quickly turned. Hours had passed and as she left, a gargoyle attacked! And it didn’t stop there. No. It would seem her thirst for blood had unsettled something sinister. The only luck she held onto was Sylis and Shadar happening to be at the graveyard when she was attacked. Two other guild members aided too, Emmerick, a wizard, and Shard, a Warforge.\n\nThey were there to uproot the dark workings that had been reported of late in the cemetery. For Lana, that was news since she had visited her mother’s grave every day for the past two weeks. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nLana ended up tagging along, remembering all who helped were rewarded by the guild. But three hundred gold pieces didn’t seem like much after fighting ghouls, encountering a blood cult, and killing a ghost that took turns possessing the men. It had taken a great toll on all of them, the men having aged, and all with their various cuts and bruises.\n\nAn Elf, Wendelin, the one who had requested their services in the first place, urged them all to return once more to the crypt, sensing something dark still remaining. Lana should have suspected then when she reminded them it was okay to run too if whatever it was that linger was greater than their abilities to handle. But the lure of money sang to her and with Shard and Shadar, Lana returned.\n\nThe pits of the crypt bore forth a demon. It was what the cult was summoning. Lana quickly realized her feeble bit of fire magic held no effect. Swiftly she retreated to the raised well of holy water. She filled an empty vial with the liquid as well as her emptied water skin. Lana rushed back and threw the glass bottle at the demon. It smashed against its monstrous head. The water sizzled as the creature agonized. It then sent a chain at Shard, knocking him out.\n\nShard and Lana can back to the well, Lana pouring out the holy water in the hallway behind them. She then jumped into the pool, part of her wondering if the water would affect her adversely. Her thoughts didn’t linger long as the demon came into sight. It squeezed down the hallway, through the holy water, and rounded the corner to attack Shadar. When he dropped, Lana began to splash the water all over. It was her only defense, her only hope to keep the demon at bay. She then sucked in a deep breath and plunged beneath the surface of the water.\n\nMoments later, a current sudden and strong pulled her from the well and over the crumpled pieces of the structure. The beast had broken the well and screamed in it’s agony as the holy water burned its legs. Lana scrambled to her feet and fled. Wendelin said it was okay to flee. There was no more holy water to use. There was no one else to help fight. She would die if she stayed.\n\nOut of the crypt Lana immediately went into her hysterics. People would come. Someone would help! Her adrenaline was pumping and it was easy to use it to the effect she needed. The first person was a hundred feet from the crypt and Lana began to explain what was happening, looking back once to see if the demon had followed. When she returned her eyes to the person, her mouth fell open and the tears stopped.\n\n**Mother? How?**\n\nWith joy greater than anything she would have expected, she threw her arms around the woman. In that moment there was no demon, no Barut, no nothing that made her afraid. But hands pressed against her shoulders, pushing her back. Lana looked into the eyes of her mother only for them to be filled with anger. “You killed me,” she stated coldly. “You killed me!”\n\nEyes wide as saucers in her confusion, Lana attempted to explain herself. Her mother had been slowly dying since Lana was six years old. Her lungs were deteriorating and the healers couldn’t fix it. Many memories flooded to her mind of her mother sitting in a chair, conserving every breath she could. Before long she was bedridden. When Lana was nearly twelve, her mother one day said absent mindedly, “I wish this all could just end.” So she acted mercifully, knowing how to take away the pain and struggle. She had done the same to other animals on the farm when they were wounded beyond help.\n\nHer father had walked in minutes later to find the pillow forced upon his wife’s face, the limp hands that rested fitfully on the bed, and his daughter unperturbed by her actions. That was what got her sent to the Asylum.\n\nBut there she was, in a graveyard being accused by her mother for murder when all this time she thought she had helped her. Something deep inside broke and for the first time hot tears of remorse poured down her cheeks as she ran.\n\nLana returned her gaze to Rin. She took another sip of the tea he had made her, its calming effects welcomed as her encounter with her mother remained raw. “Indeed, I was asked to help with a job and now I bitterly wish I hadn’t for now I have a demon after me.”\n\nRin kept his muddy brown eyes upon her as he sipped at his tea. She hadn’t told him the exact truth, but it still left her squirming inside as she awaited judgement of whether or not he found the brief story believable.\n\n“Maybe Rin help Lana?” he finally asked. \n\n“If you can, I’ll be sure to return the favor. I’ll wash your back if you wash mine?” Lana replied, trying to throw humor in to mask her sincere gratitude. Rin shook his head.\n\n“Lana need not pay me back. Lana is Rin’s friend.”\n\nLana remained speechless as real emotion replaced the facade that was her wall. Rin somehow saw through her defences. \n\n**There it is again! He sees me!**",

She has a human form and a serpent-humanoid, similar but not equal to the Nagi race. Also the Grippli cleric casts some touch spells at a 10 ft range with his extra long tongue. Remember this.\n\nAfter establishing the freedom of the spirit dancers the party continue on their way to the ruined city. Mercer is in no short supply of entendres and sexual puns here in the jungle and has taken to calling himself \"The Snake Charmer\". When the party encounters a python Mercer takes it upon himself to handle it as \"I have experience in these sorts of things\" and winks at Elien. Trouser snake jokes are made, all the while Elien is whittling down her fangs due to the grinding of her teeth.\n\nThe party finally makes it to the ruined city in one piece, although Elien's mental state is questionable at this point. The innocent Grippli cleric thinks that Mercer and Elien are now a couple and has offered to marry them if they so wish. Elien spends that night away from camp stewing in the wilderness outside the ruins. We regroup in the morning and decide to sneak in past a patrol of monkey-goblinoids.\n\nUnfortunately we missed a trap and most of us wind up inside of a barbed net trap. Mercer is placed in a compromising position with Elien, which he finds hilarious and Elien finds infuriating, as they try to cut themselves free of the trap.\n\nInside a decrepit ziggarut we encounter some nasty enemies that cause some ability damage.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5j7tbm/dd_35e_the_memoirs_of_vincent_vaal_pt_1/",
        "text": "I am currently writing a much longer set of Star Wars (FFG) stories for you all, but after a long silence these should tide you over for a bit.  \n***\nMany, many moons ago, I played a headstrong, heavy-handed asshole by the name of Vincent Vaal. Vincent was a Xeph Soulknife (D&amp;D 3.5e) in his first incarnation, and he reveled in combat. He thoroughly enjoyed using his innate talent to surprise people, and often allowed himself to be captured and bound only to free himself and slaughter anything that moved on his way out. He was a murder-hobo, and he was absolutely fantastic at it.\n\nUntil he died.\n\nThe end of Vincent Vaal was an unpleasant one, as was his life. After a particularly brutal battle against a Big Bad with plans to murder a village and enslave their skeletons for his own purposes, the party was on its last legs as the BBEG monologued how his death would complete the ritual to raise the skeletons of everything in a five-mile radius and bind it to the caster - including the BBEG, obviously.  \n\nEarlier we had learned that the ritual didn’t particularly care who died in the big circle to complete the ritual after it was cast, and we also knew that the last thing to die in the circle after it was cast, but before the duration was up (it was only a couple of rounds) would be treated as the caster. So we had two options: Kill the BBEG before he completed casting it, or kill something else in the circle after killing him, but before the ritual ended.\n\nWe tried the first one, but that failed (by a scant 12 hp, we were told later). The party then began debating who had to die - either a party member, or one of the friendly NPCs that was willing - when it came to Vincent’s turn.\n\n&gt;Me: “So, the only way to avoid fighting a massive skeleton army is to have someone else assume the mantle of the ritual?”  \n&gt;DM: “Yes.”  \n&gt;Me: “And whoever assumes the mantle gets to control said skeleton army?”  \n&gt;DM: “Yes…”  \n&gt;Me: “And I’m guessing that it would force an alignment change to whoever assumes the mantle?”  \n&gt;DM: “Nope.”  \n&gt;Me: “Huh… The mantle doesn’t exert any sort of will of it’s own?”  \n&gt;DM: “Nope. Your talking time is almost up.”  \n&gt;Me: “Sure, sure. Uh… Okay. Vincent walks into the circle and executes a coup de grace.”  \n&gt;DM: “Okay, sure. On which of the three NPCs that are waiting?”  \n&gt;Me: “On himself.”  \n&gt;Party: “What?”  \n\nSee, Vincent was Chaotic Neutral. He firmly believed that people (souls, specifically) should be able to make their own decisions. By raising every skeleton in a five-mile radius - over and above having already killed a bunch of people to make it happen, which goes against that belief - the BBEG wanted to forced those souls to return to power the skeletons, stealing the final rest that the souls went to away from them. Vincent could not abide by that.\n\nHe also could not accept that the town, a major producer (46%) of wheat for the kingdom, could not be worked if the population was dead. So he struck a deal with himself: For a year and a day, the skeletons would work the fields, and then be released. The party was sent with a message to the local Duke: “You have one year to repopulate the town of Amber Waves, or the grain will stop.” The skeletons of animals unfit for labor - birds, frogs, fish, and such - were released from service immediately, and went back to being piles of bones. The rest, along with the population, worked for a year and a day. 24 hours a day for 366 days. \n\nDid that keep the souls from their final rest? Yes. Did that save the kingdom from famine? Yes. Is that what the villagers would have wanted?\n\nVincent thought so.\n\nAfter his service (while I played another, less interesting character) Vincent was called upon by his deity to be reborn as an Elan Kineticist (Psion). His alignment changed to CG, and we learned that DM and I didn’t read the Power Points per Day table properly.\n\nHoo boy, did that ever change the party dynamics.\n***\nPrevious stories:  \n[John Random's Revenge (glossary)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/)  \n[The New Adventures of Jalees Kamal](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bo141/vtmmedthe_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal/)",

        "text": "Game summary 04DEC2016 p.2\nThe wolves told the party about the possible culprit, a hooded figure going only by the name of \"the Mysterious Benefactor.\" Redwood, a Goliath living within Titan's Vale, knew a bit more than the wolves did- he had seen the Benefactor's face, and knew him as a yellow Tiefling. He had also heard the Tiefling's grand plan, to lead the wolves in rebellion against the King so he could take the Magus Staff of Oleander, an item that granted kingship to its holder. Redwood, however, left out that little detail when telling the others about the strange being. RIP in pepperoni. After some debate, Andazar turned over rule back to Brutus- swearing on his honor that if he heard word of the Wolf attempting another revolution, he would return. Andazar warned the beastkin monk that their next battle would end with a claymore in his throat should that happen. Andazar entered the nearby temple to Saren'rae- though it was more of a shrine than anything- and called upon a newly ascended God, Norad, for answers. After exchanging jabs- Andazar and Norad had quite a bit of a past between them, and enough beef to end world hunger. Norad knew little in detail about the yellow Tiefling aside from a very powerful magical presence that had sprung up in Oleander very recently, specifically with great summoning powers and a pact with a deadly fiend. Norad also knew some information on Theran, Andazar's lost son. It turned out the young boy had gotten put in prison for attempting his own theft of the Magus Staff. This information on Andazar's mind, the group turned in for the night, finally preparing to head to Oleander's capital, Centralia. \n\nGame summary 11DEC2016\nThe party awoke the next morning, ready and willing to move on to the city. First, however, they took one last opportunity to speak with the denizens of Titan's Vale. Andazar specifically obtained the favor of a young wolf half-breed named Ahri, who was one of the three breeding females of the pack. She agreed to travel with the party and help cook food, as Ardon the Paladin had a tendency to bless the food he made- which burned Andazar's tongue. Using Ardon's new Find Steed spell, the group mounted up and began moving, but unfortunately they were hindered by the number of people to horses, as they had only three- Ardon's, Arion's, and Redwood the Goliath Druid, who used his druidic powers to become a horse himself. With 3 horses to 8 people, Shigehara and Andazar were forced to walk. Their movement speed hindered them and they were caught in a battle with a rampaging Hill Giant, which nearly took the life of Ahri, in a haunting repeat of Peerah's death that was still fresh in Clarine's mind. Luckily, Ahri was made of stouter stuff, and even managed to get some damage in before she was knocked unconscious- with a brutal stab to the Giant's most sensitive area... Continuing to travel until sundown, the group stopped outside of Paradise for the evening, agreeing to take watches every hour. Before turning in, Andazar took a moment to speak with Starke, learning of her noble heritage, which she had spurned for a life of warfare. The night passed quietly until Redwood's watch, when a robed figure appeared. He attempted to awaken Andazar, but before he could, the figure disappeared. The Tiefling, seemingly enraged at the Goliath's sudden assault to his sleep, handed over his Claymore and warned Redwood that should he do it again, Andazar would not hesitate to make him regret it. Soon Clarine began her shift, after attempting to get Redwood to take it. Andazar, sensing the intense levels of shitbag emanating from the Half-Elf, awoke and reminded Clarine of her duty. A duty that Clarine swiftly fell asleep on. After her hour passed, Redwood, a light sleeping Druid, awoke and decided not to wake the next guard- Ahri- and generously took her shift. However, the robed figure appeared once again, and in a fit of desperation, Redwood used Call Lightning on it. Doing so awoke the entire camp. Andazar became enraged and choked out the poor, bumbling druid, who landed on Clarine and dealt a solid amount of bludgeoning damage. Upon inspecting the robe left behind and recognizing the demonic power emanating from it, Andazar realized that Redwood had been right. Sheepishly he awoke the Goliath, and discovered in a strange turn of events that Redwood was only 16, making this another act of aggression against a baby, not Andazar's first and likely not the last. The group took their final hour of rest and pushed forward into Paradise. They did some business with the locals, procuring another horse and improving their weapons, before moving on to the Capitol Road. Luckily, the well-patrolled and guarded road held little danger, allowing for a rare social moment. Clarine revealed that she was the daughter of the Duke of Canterbalshite, which was then revealed to be bullshit, and she gave in. Her true name was Carnys, and she had been born in Entranzia to an elven father and a Dwarven mother, which lead to her small stature. They continued to speak and then made camp as the day came to a close. They were suddenly approached by a strange cleric named Migo. Put off by his jet black armor and his almost crazed demeanor, the group questioned him. Migo struck out with a Vampiric Touch at Ardon, but failed to hit true. A Rogue appeared from the bushes and made his attack, which was both spotted and avoided. A fighter rushed in, closing the gap, as Migo attempted to make a stand. Calling out a name, Sten, he tried to hold out, but to no avail as he was knocked unconscious by the party. Sten, the rogue cursed Migo's name, and also revealed that he was Migo's brother. Starke attempted to strike at the fighter, but he returned with a strong Riposte and dealt a fair amount of damage. The fighter, who the Rogue referred to as Thok, was quickly taken down by arrows from Shigehara's bow and Carnys' spell, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, as well as several close melee and spell attacks from the rest of the party. Turning their attention to Sten, the rogue attempted to flee, but by the will of the dice his attempts to hide were thwarted. He was brought down by an Alchemist's Fire potion and a swift shot from Starke. The group tried to glean information from Migo after awakening him, but his disrespectful responses lead to a summary execution. Soon Sten was silenced as well, and then Thok fell. However, before the group could revel in their victory, they spotted a fire that had been started by the Alchemist's Fire potion. Oops. And that is where we left off...\n\n(Written by the DM Nick Thorn)",

        "text": "Simply put, the party had just turned level 6, and I had taken Displacement as a 3rd level spell. I chose Face-Changer as a Reserve Feat due to the fact that Charles is now wanted all over the continent. We had also just added a Bard and a Cleric, both very new to the game.\n\nWe are tasked with checking out a town in neutral territory that has been out of contact for weeks. Pretty simple, right? Go in, clear out any baddies, go back and report.\n\nThe party stumbles upon a river. We're traveling through a murky biome, so there are little opportunities to cross. Upon traveling upriver, we find a broken down wagon that looks pretty fresh.\n\nI make an explosion (Fiery Burst) above the water to check for gators. A bush across the water shakes and we hear a slight cursing. I motion my party to hide behind the wagon, as I write the words \"Your money or your life\" on a scroll. I have my badger cast Sepia Snake Sigil on the paper, bring it back to me so I can roll it up, and go across the river via the treeline to deliver it to the bush. About 10 seconds later, we hear more cursing. I cast Message at whatever's cursing inside the bush. \"You cannot put a price on your soul, mortal.\" Upon succeeding my Intimidate check, the party sees a battleaxe flung across the river in defiance and a shadow move deeper into the treeline.\n\nWe cross the river using rope tied to the broken down wagon, and the party goes towards the town. I stop at the bush, there are several items littered on the floor and a man as stiff as a board in the bush itself. I take the time to study his face and derobe him. I slit his throat and throw his body in the river. Upon donning the tattered rags, slinging the rusty shortsword on my side and the much less ragged looking shortbow on my back, I make a shoddy looking mask with a length of rope and a piece of bark and don it on my forehead (so my party can recognize me). I venture back to my party with no incident. We reach the town: An island inside a large mile-wide cove, smoldering from what looked like an invasion. I turn around (as I had taken the lead) and say \"Wait here, I'll be right back,\" throwing the mask down on my face.\n\nI stroll down the bridge, makin' my way downtown, when all of a sudden several arrows land at my feet. I yell \"Oh shit shit shit shit shit, it's ME you assholes!.. Oh yeah\" as my face takes 4 seconds to change, then I take off my mask revealing myself as the dead man in the river. \"Oh, Sven! You're back!\" bellows a large gruff looking man who looks like he's seen some serious combat. \"Come in!\" The portcullis opens, and the captain stops me for a briefing. \"Oh man, so we watched the southern border, you know along the river so we could catch any imperial dogs that might be making their way here. All I remember is seeing some sort of... Badger or something hand me a scroll, reading it, and waking up with my partner gone. I think there might be a rogue necromancer in the area or something, or perhaps a mage working with one of the rival bandit clans.\" The commander assures me, \"Have no fear, Sven, we are the most fearsome bandits in the land, no petty mage is going to stop us.\" We both let out a hearty laugh. Commander gives me a wave and tells me to go eat and rest, as he can hear the rest of my debriefing later. I say \"Ay, where's Town Hall? I need to take a piss\" and someone points me to a decrepit shell of a building. I find some privacy, and reapply my face (it runs out every 3 in-game minutes). I go to the bandit food-pile, find the kegs, and have my weasel cast Prestidigitation on the kegs, to make the beer taste much, much weaker than it actually was. The drinking accelerates.\n\nI go back to the bridge and study the walls, they seem to be pretty easy to scale, even without tools. The way this bridge was constructed also points to a path under the bridge where we could move undetected. As I make my way out the gate, the commander stops me asking me for my briefing. A combination of me being too specific and a pretty average roll got me caught. The commander spoke in hushed tones to the archers (at this point I made my DM aware Charles knew something was up) and then with the flick of his wrist, bandits were shooting at me. I get the first move, throw my weasel out of my sleeve to Ghoul Touch the bandit trying to close the portcullis. Book it outside the gate *just* in time. While the bandits took time to re-situate themselves for a shot at me, I cast Displacement on myself. I get nicked by two arrows, but my escape is not impeded.\n\nI relay to the party what I had just learned, and we get to planning. Suddenly, it dawns on me. We have a Bard. A Bard with Alter Self. A Bard with Alter Self that is not confident in his ability to role play and was getting kind of bored. Charles says to the Bard, \"I know how we can take care of this with the least casualties, but you have to trust me completely.\" After the bard agrees, we rest for 4 hours so I can recharge my spells and we can wait for night. At dusk, I get my party to go under the bridge (with the armored folk at the treeline just in case shit goes awry.) I then alter my face and whisper \"Take your clothes off, to your loincloth, and copy this face. He does as I tell him. \"Now you are going to climb over the wall and yell furiously, pretending to be the commander of these bandits. Trust me, you'll know what to do.\" I cast Message on the Bard and he goes over the wall. I tell him \"Now shout furiously, telling your men to 'bring me the man that stole my armor, warhammer, and my face. He's as good as dead.'\" The Bard repeats this phrase, with much better delivery than the Wizard ever could. He rolled a 26 on his Bluff check. At this point, he has half of the bandits around him in a crowd, \"1,000 gold pieces to the first man that brings me this impostor!\" 28 on his Bluff check. Within two minutes, the commander is being dragged out by his own men, screaming in a bloody rage. I tell the Bard to \"stay cool, and whenever the real commander yells, simply yell louder. Have him gagged.\" The Bard does as told, ordering the bandits to gag their 'fake' leader. The Diplomacy check is a 16, but at this point, the bandits firmly believe our Bard is their leader, and to top it off, they are all much more inebriated than usual due to my earlier Prestidigitation. \"Good, now slit the man's throat.\" The Bard grabs a knife from the nearest bandit and does as he's told. The commander now lies dead at the Bard's feet. The Bard dons the chainmail armor and warhammer, with 50 minutes of his Disguise Self (and my Message) spell left to order the bandit army however he pleases. The session ends on that cliffhanger.\n\nThe PC that was playing Bard came up to me at the end of the session and told me that was the most fun he ever had playing D&amp;D ever, and that Charisma might just be his new favorite stat.\n\nThis, my friends, is the true power of Bards.",

        "text": "This is from an almost two year long ongoing D&amp;D 5e homebrew steampunk campaign. The setting is mostly controlled by technocentrists that won a war against supporters of magic. After decades of uneasy peace, the tech people have started to kill off any supporters and practitioners of magic. Our group is in the crosshairs, and every settlement we go through usually ends up ransacked shortly after we arrive. All this to say that for more than a year of campaigning we have not been in a city that wasn't at least apathetic towards us, if not openly hostile.\n\nMy character: Goulash Axle-Thunder-Lars, a travelling halfling bard that loves learning about savage cultures and playing heavy metal covers of songs. He lives the rock star lifestyle, travelling to seedy bars, singing about the party's adventures, and participating in \"cultural exchange activities\" with groupies he finds. He has left plenty of broken hearts, but still carries a memento of an Orcish lady he ran off on during his travels. \n\nAfter weeks of travel the party arrived at an Orc controlled city not currently involved in the ongoing conflict, with the mission to meet with the Khan to discuss the brewing war. With the group on the run or adventuring most of the time, Goulash hasn't really been his usual self in a long time. So while the rest of the party was doing errands or whatever before seeing the Khan, Goulash took this as a chance to unwind, hit all the bars, get properly soused, extoll the party's previous exploits, and somehow drag himself to the Khan's hold on time to meet the rest of the party. The argument being that this was the best way to properly honor the Orcish culture, of course.\n\nBy the time the party convened in front of the Khan's hold, Goulash had drunkenly brought along dozens of groupies. After convincing them to keep the party outside of the hold (really high persuasion), he stumbled inside with the rest of the party. Goulash wouldn't have noticed (horrible insight rolls), but most of the Orcish elites were sneering at him, pointing, whispering to each other. \n\nWhen the time came for the party to address the Khan, Goulash botched another insight roll and casually approached. The Khan said something along the lines of \"Why should I listen to you?\", and was going down the line asking the other members of the party to convince him that we were honorable people with a righteous cause.  When it was Goulash's turn to talk, he used his significant persuasive powers to speak of honor and righteousness, and about the importance of their cause. Or he tried, because the Khan suddenly got up and screamed \"You?! You dare to speak about honor?!\".\n\nTurns out:  \n* Goulash knocked up the Khan's daughter and left before finding out.  \n* The Khan's daughter, because of Goulash, ran off with her child to a rebellious Orcish tribe that the Khan is currently trying to quell.  \n* Goulash missed every insight roll to even remember any of this, and stumbled into the hold while dragging along a bunch of drunken revelers.\n\nNow the party was surrounded, and the Khan was ready to kill Goulash on the spot, if not everyone in the party by association. So as any good bard with high charisma does, he rolled persuasion. He argued for the Khan to spare the rest of the party, since whatever happened between them didn't concern the rest of the group. Not really an apology, but it was the best he could do considering he just learned about this.\n\nNAT 20. Which, according to the DM after the fact, was pretty much the only way to avoid combat in this situation. Begrudgingly, the Khan dismissed everyone else in the hold and demanded we come to his \"office\". There he gave us a new mission, to rescue his daughter/granddaughter and stop the rival tribe. Then he'll listen to the party and, maybe, spare my life.\n\nAnd that's where we left it for now. In hindsight, I made all the wrong decisions the moment I stepped into the city. But it turned out alright. ",

        "text": "This story came to mind thanks to a certain /u/patches765 whose stories I have been reading.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a Pathfinder game that was rather high powered, amongst a group of friends whom had been playing for a couple of years at this point. Perhaps 7 of us including whoever was running the game at this time. \n\nIn the time we had been playing together in previous campaigns, I tended to make an archer ranger, capable of taking down most things in a couple of rounds, never getting hit, and generally being another pair of eyes and ears for when the rogue fell into the pit trap and needed recovering... \n\nIn any case, this time around, the archer ranger wasn't something I was in the mood to play, and when it was announced that we were going to rolling 3d6+6 for the stats, the character of a mere farmhand propelled to greatness through sheer necessity easily came. Only this time around he would be a wizard/sorcerer, working in a small way to help overthrow the current rulers who for whatever reason he felt were oppressive and unfair to the peasant class (they weren't). \n\nI rolled well. Two stats at the start were over 22, one a 24. With being a human, it allowed one of the stats to be bumped up by 2 points etc etc. That one of the stats was a 9 wasn't important.\n\nMy clumsy (9 dex) but very intelligent wizard (24 int), sent on a scholarship by the temple of Erastil to the local wizarding school was born. \n\nThe initial adventures were fine, fairly standard fare, only really interesting because of the rogue who seemed utterly incapable of disabling any form of trap. \n\nOpen a lock, fine. \n\nJump over the wall, do a backflip onto the guards head and spear him through the eye socket with his own rapier, fine. \n\nDisable a poison dart trap? Better get the ambulance out!. (AKA the cleric)\n\nThe only thing that came of them really was that the rogue was missing a toe, and the Paladin of the party found the stick that had been inserted at birth had been solidly implanted sideways, making him even more of an annoyance than usual. \n\nApparently, even being Chaotic, regardless if Good, Neutral or whatever meant that you needed to be converted, and converted at the point of a sword if needs be. How this Paladin found out my character was Chaotic in Alignment I have no idea, but it was discovered. At that point, initially there were polite discussions about conversion to the light of Torag, Erastil or some other deity who followed the light. Respectful discussions, where theology and the meaning of chaos and law and all that followed was discussed. I thought it had gotten to a point of live and let live, we would have to agree to disagree.\n\nThe paladin didn't see it quite the same way. Eventually when they were out in the middle of nowhere, travelling to some town to deal with a vampire who was getting a little big for his boots, the showdown happened. \n\nThe paladin threatened my wizard that if he did not convert there and then, that in the land beyond the line (beyond the law therefore), he (the Paladin) would see to the sorcerers execution as a threat to the land due to being an agent of chaos. The wizard declined to convert at swordpoint, and the execution was set for the next morning, after the Paladin had completed his prayers. After all, nothing like a little PVP to set your morning right. \n\nThe cage was brought out of the wagon, the wizard placed in it, and the party went to sleep. However, a vital piece of information had been forgotten. The rogue owed the wizard a number of favours, due to excess coinage having found its way to the rogue from the wizard. The rogue let the wizard out. \n\nThe wizard retrieved his equipment, key amongst which was a rod of maximise (lesser). Invoking the power of nature, the wizard created a ball of liquid lightning around his fist, lacing it with his fury at having being threatened so. \n\nHolding the action, the wizard walked over to the Paladin and smiled. The paladin was still in his armour. His full plate, mithril armour. Checking the timepiece, it was a minute or two into the following day. This was important, as it was therefore the morning of the next day. \n\nHe discharged the shocking grasp spell into the sleeping body of the paladin. The GM ruled that this could be counted as a coup de grace action, as there was no chance the Paladin would be able to dodge on account of being asleep. \n\nSuffice to say that there was a flash, sparks exploding over the clearing, and then a very crispy paladin. The paladin took 30 points of lightning to the chest, which was then doubled thanks to critting (coup de grace). 60 points of damage. This in and off itself didn't kill the Paladin, but the fact that we were playing with death by massive damage did as he proceeded to fail the fort save.\n\nTLDR - Paladin did Paladin things to a Wizard. Paladin got an execution, just not the one he wanted.",

        "text": "If any travelers of the starlight Valley are here, lmk. \n\nAnyway, so I'm playing in a homebrew setting as the dwarf bard Baldric Silversson, slated to inherit the family jewelers business but instead ran away with his bagpipes and hand drum to learn about the world (planning to go college of lore). In our second session, our group is exploring an area where an evil black mass erupted from the ground into the sky and turned villagers into zombies of some kind. \n\nSo we find a crack in the mountain that leads to a sharp drop off that then leads to an incredibly old temple of some kind and we fight a monstrous human woman eating a dead goblin. Proceeding onward, we hear what sounds like metal clashing on metal from a room ahead. Cautiously peeking around the corner, we see two goblin children hitting each other with metal poles they'd apparently found laying around. Baldric, being a nice (read as naive) guy, decides he'd try to talk to them. \n\nStriking up a conversation with them, he learns the goblins have a village nearby and they come here secretly to play and get away from their mom, who incidentally says dwarves are all meanie heads and should be killed. Hearing this, I try to get on their good side by telling them about how I'm also a cool rebel who gets away from his parents, telling them how I ran away from home to go on adventures. After I said this, they seemed to warm up to me and we discussed what they had seen in their time in this temple. \n\nJust as the party and I were about to leave however, we noticed a knife fling itself out of the wall and towards us (some sort of invisible temple guardian we haven't managed to ID yet), but the DM rolled a 1 and instead ruled that the knife hit one of the two goblins in the head, killing him instantly. The other goblin freaked and ran down the hall and got cut by another of the temples monstrous inhabitants who was hiding in a room, and was bleeding out on the floor there. \n\nThinking quickly, Baldric runs as fast as he can to the goblin and puts himself in harms way to use his last spell slot and heal the goblin back to stability. After a short fight we have a momentary lull, but the goblin is just crying and seems to be shocked by his brothers death to the point of inactivity. I get a light bulb moment and decide to use one of my bardic inspirations to get him to his senses, and tell him to run back to his village and tell them this temple is not safe. \n\nAfter watching him run away, we continue exploring the temple until the whole mountain starts shaking and crumbling and a mysterious black fluid starts oozing from the cracks. We immediately try to make a run for safety, but realize our initial entry is likely unusable since it was a small crack on top a large drop off. Baldric thinks fast again and rolls to try to follow the goblin child's footsteps in the dust and blood and ooze out of the temple, figuring he'd know the best way out. Nat 20. The party runs and follows in his footsteps, hopefully saved by one goblin child's tracks. \n\nSo in short, #notallgoblins. But nah, more seriously I'm pretty new to D&amp;D and this was a great moment for role playing that showed me that murder isn't always the best solution.",

        "text": "A few months ago, my friends and I realized that, although we loved playing Ark (XBox One), the public servers were a bit chaotic.  We didn't want to have to deal with politics; we just wanted to have fun playing with Dinosaurs, and we realized that we had an extra XBox One.  We could host our OWN server, and have fun on it.  \n\nEventually, we got an idea that we could broadcast our games on Twitch, and start a kind of Reality TV sort of thing.  All four of us would play on separate factions, each with \"locked tames\" as we called them. Only we were allowed to have certain tames and animals; any other tames we saw by other players not on our team would be shot on sight.  We'd recruit players from the audience to come join us on the server.  It would be awesome.  \n\nWe started building up resources and tames (slightly delayed due to the server owner occasionally shutting off the server so his girlfriend could play on it), and developing the story for the RP PvPvE server...\n\nAnd then the server got wiped around November.  \n\nWe went into overdrive, building up supplies and tames again.  We revamped the story: Now there would only be 2 factions, but we'd keep the same basic idea.  \n\n**Dramatis Personae**\n\n*The Aquero Coalition*  \nA scientific team, trying to find out more about The Island and its mysterious technology.  They controlled only the island in the southeast, and had fortified it heavily.  \n\n* Colton, a marine biologist, played by myself.  I claimed almost all of the animals of the ocean.  \n\n* Carter, a helicopter pilot, played by B.  His tames were the dinosaurs of the sky (apart from the birds).\n\n*The Beryl Acropolis*  \nA group of people more focused on controlling territory, and less on tinkering with the huge obelisks.  They controlled huge swaths of territory, sacrificing power in one place for control over territory.\n\n* Markov, a huge russian man with a mysterious past and impeccable aim, played by J.  He was the great bear, with all of the mammals and birds to his name.\n\n* Misled, a bit of a rogue element, played by V, the owner of the server.  Ran the swamps, and had all of the swampy, poisony tames to himself... or herself (he'd been messing with that little implant in his arm).\n\nThe territory distribution looked like a game of Risk, where one player had some fortified territories across all continents, and the other player had thoroughly fortified Australia.\n\nOur story was ready and raring to go, we worked around the clock to get everything ready on the server, the day of the first broadcast, on Sunday Evening. We are set to begin at 6:30.  We got on at 4:30, check in, and then J and B have to leave to do some last-minute stuff before we start.  We agree that before they get back, we'll need to reboot the server, because we had adjusted some of the stats higher for \"set building\" purposes.  We wanted to lower those stats before the server went public, so we could have a even playing field.  Part of the plot was going to be my antics, messing with the towers, and adjusting the server's stats.  \n\n6:30 rolls around, both J and B got delayed, but they had texted me.  Only I was online.  V had disappeared.  \n\n7:00. Everyone's back, except for V. We've informed our friends who were waiting to watch us that we've been delayed.  We start wondering what happened to V.  \n\nEventually, at around 9:30, V got on, and apologized, because he dozed off.  We're all a little upset about this.  Tempers flared, V tried to simultaneously take the blame and shift the blame off of him by saying there was no one around to keep him awake, shouting happened (some of it mine, and I'm not proud of that), and V ends up turning off his game, shutting off the server for the night.\n\nWe let our potential viewers know that we're going to be starting up on Monday the 5th.  We all logged on on Monday night, we're all amicable, and we go on, have a great time.  Fun was had by all.\n\nDuring the week, we played a bit.  We found someone has set up a small building elsewhere on the island, so we knew people are logging on.  The server's starting to pick up, just a bit.\n\nNext Sunday rolls around, and we realize that we should have a bit more conflict in the server for the viewers.  The \"script\" (in a Reality TV kind of way) is that the Aquero Coalition was going to go build a secondary base near the Red Obelisk, while The Beryl Acropolis was going to try to disrupt them in some way, in a \"Stop f-ing with the towers\" kind of way.\n\nSo B and I logged in, I started broadcasting, and we got into character.  \n\n---------------\n\nCarter and Colton start making their way over to a location they had scouted out last week.  They actually get a foundation going, before they realize that they need to get more materials.  So they pack up, hop on their boat, and head back to base in the southeast.  \n\nAs they start to pull in to the natural bay, and sneak the boat around their multiple Megalodons and single Dunkleosteus, Carter and Colton are chatting about what else they're going to need to get, when Colton looks up in the sky, and announces \"Um, I see a parachute above our base...\"\n\nAnd then a few grenades go off above the base.\n\n\"...and explosions.\"\n\nBoth Carter and Colton go in to combat mode, taking out their longneck rifles.  They are far from prepared for combat, and they don't realize until later that Colton had all of the rifle ammunition.  Colton takes a shot with his crossbow (loaded with Tranquilizer Arrows), and misses horribly, then makes a run for the base.  Carter charges around to the west side of the island, where the parachute landed.  \n\nColton hops on their team's Pteranodon, and takes to the sky, trying to get a view on where the attack was coming from, and eventually spots someone on the beach.  He tries to sweep in and pick up the attacker, but misses.  He keeps moving, trying to avoid the explosions of the grenades the attacker is wildly chucking.\n\nMeanwhile, Carter charges down the beach with his pike at the ready.  The person on the beach drops a gas grenade at Carter's feet, and Carter drops, fast asleep.  \n\nColton lands the Pteranodon, and starts running over to where the battle had taken place, and finds two people quietly napping: Carter, and the lady who was referring to him/herself as \"Misled\".  Evidently, they had gotten caught in their own poison gas grenade.  \n\nColton, not knowing what exactly to do, keeps Misled tranquilized (with some arrows), and goes and force-feeds Stimulants to Carter, getting him up.  \n\nCarter and Colton keep Misled unconscious, while they discuss what they're going to do.  It doesn't feel right to just kill Misled, or take some equipment, but at the same time, they attacked first.  \n\nIt's in the middle of this discussion that they realize that Markov must also be on their island, when a bullet connects with Colton's Flak Helmet with a resounding \\*WHANG\\*.\n\nBoth Carter and Colton duck for cover, but not before Colton tells Carter to finish off Misled.  They would revive back at their base, and the two could not deal with them right now, not with Markov firing on them.  \n\nColton got back on the Pteranodon, and took to the sky, trying to find the Russian sniper before he got another shot off.  \n\nHe didn't find Markov, but the Pteranodon took a shot that nearly killed him.  \n\nColton urged the Pteranodon into the base, and let loose a whistle to make his tamed dinosaurs attack any enemy on sight.  Anyone who tried to attack would get two Tyrannosaurus Rexes, several herbivores, a Tapejara, a Quetzalcoatlus, and four Pelagornis coming right for them.  He landed.\n\nThere's a short period of quiet, and Carter and Colton think that Markov must have retreated.  They start to assess the damage, which thankfully wasn't much.  \n\nThen, the tames lift off, and start charging to the west.  The Rexes, Triceratopses, and Parasaurs had quite a bit of trouble getting up the cliff face, but the Quetz, Tapejara, and Pelagornis had no such issue.    \n\nA few blasts from a rifle, lots of squalking and flying around in circles, and a few poison grenades later, one of the Pelagornis is dead, but so is Markov.  \n\nRight as Carter and Colton get up to the top of the island to assess the damage *again*, J hops in our chat and tells us to stop the broadcast.  \n\n---------------\n\nWhat had transpired was that after J and V started their assault, both J and V missed the landing inside the base, and ended up on the cliffside to the west.  V panicked when he saw both of us trying to attack him, and ended up poisoning himself, knocking himself out.  While B and I were discussing what to do, V was screaming at J to come help him and get him up, while J did the tactically sound decision of staying back and seeing what we were doing.  All of the equipment they had brought was disposable.  They were willing to lose it.  \n\nOnce J realized that we were, in his eyes, \"toying with him,\" (the point where we were having moral dilemmas, and trying to figure out what the hell to do) he went loud, and started trying to kill us.  It was sheer luck that the first rifle shot didn't kill Colton, and that the second shot didn't kill the Pteranodon.  \n\nV was enraged that J had just stayed back and didn't try to save him.  He started accusing him and us of planning this humiliation; that we had somehow conspired to make fools of him.\n\nHe rage quit, and went to play Battlefield.  \n\nShortly afterwards, the server went down.  \n\nJ, B, and I were discussing what we were going to do, and we had already come to a conclusion.  We knew what we were going to do, going forward, but how V was going to factor in to it was dependent on what he did.  \n\nV joined our chat, blamed J for, in his eyes, taking advantage of him, announced that he was done, and he had deleted the server.  \n\nSo that was it.  One lost fight, and it was game over.  \n\nIt had been a good run, and a lot of good memories, but the world we had built was gone. \n\nV left our chat, and we enacted what we had said we were going to do.  We unfriended him across various platforms, removed him from our various groups, and announced that we were unable to continue the server story due to a member of our group, and that we had removed him due to his poor sportsmanship and toxicity.  \n\nWe've resolved to get ourselves a dedicated Xbox for us to control, and have the server hosted on that.  Sometime down the road, we'll start streaming on that server, and generally have fun, but for now, it's done.",

        "text": "Everything has its season, and everything dies. Bad games don't tend to have long lifespans, either because of player actions or general lack of interest. In the case of this Case File, it was one character choice that dealt the fatal blow to Adeptus Evangelion.\n\nFor those joining us now, allow me to make a brief recap. In the previous session, one of the only two PCs died in an unexpected firefight. The character, Speedwagon, had basically taken half the game with him upon his death. His player, apparently not understanding how much material the GM had put into Operations Director hands to the exclusion of pilot players, wanted to play a pilot. His new character was a “genki” teenager who had absolutely no memorable character traits beyond “look at how cheerful and/or naive I am.” I can't recall if any of the other players showed their faces this time.\n\nThe death of Speedwagon left my character, Aiden Tanner, as the last character from the start to remain alive. Well, alive in the sense that she had a positive wound total. Aiden was not in a great place in this game; she was an unintentional murderer, she had a house full of incidental NPC pilots that she had to take care of, and her number of positive human relationships had dropped to one. Early in the session, she was even informed that her mother had been reported deceased. Aiden was now and truly Shinji'd. \n\nThe funny thing was, I was having a ball. Aiden was now in the unique position of being the “adult” of Speedwagon's little “estate.” As stated above, she had to take care of three other pilots. Two of these were player characters who for various reasons had been unable to make it, while the third was the Rei-expy that Speedwagon had “seduced” during a drunken bender. I might have had a little too much fun roleplaying Aiden at this point; I spent the first bit of this session putting the building blocks into place for clearing up the broken glass and replacing the furniture. Then the NERV men came, and said that there was a new mission. Aiden would be briefed when she got to the base. Yay.\n\nThere was a moment before the briefing that I actually remember with fondness. Huey and Aiden have met face to face for the first time since the shooting. Huey had been informed by his caregiver that Aiden had killed someone, and thus was rightfully scared of her. It took Aiden explaining that it had been an accident (she'd just barely come to terms with it herself) for Huey to trust her again, and thankfully Huey DID give her enough time to explain. It was probably the first, last, and only time in this game that anyone actually listened to Aiden. Pity it was immediately squashed by Project JAGUAR.\n\nSo, what IS Project JAGUAR? All we've heard about it was that it had a comic book related to it, and it scared the hell out of NERV. Well, as it turns out Project Jaguar was the GM's take on Jet Alone. For those who haven't seen Evangelion, Jet Alone was basically a remote-controlled alternative to the Evas. It was, effectively, the liberal equivalent to the Evangelion project: a fancy machine that was ethically more sound on paper but didn't address the actual problem. It would, if left unchecked, put everyone in NERV out of a job. For this reason the NERV higher ups had decided that the appropriate thing to do was send in the Evas and wreck Jet Alone, for all the world to see.\n\nIn retrospect, the concept of attacking Project JAGUAR was kinda creepy. We know the plan's mastermind is going to be there with his family, so we're going to bring in our giant mechs to stomp on his balls. Clearly NERV is not on the up-and-up. Clearly. The GM made it clear from the word “go” that the plan for this fight was to not only defeat the Jet Alone, but to do so in such a way that there was no doubt in the Evangelion's superior statistics. Therefore, this fight would be taking collateral damage and publicity into account. Succeed, and we'd cement NERV's position as the UN's only redoubt against the Angels. Fail, and the game would end. Wanting the game to continue, we leapt on this.\n\nAnyhow, five Evangelions are deployed within the military complex that houses Project JAGUAR. Every member of Project JAGUAR was in attendance, celebrating the first prototype of what they assumed would be the new guardians of humanity. The Jet Alone is activated, and proudly proclaimed (in the GM's best Liberty Prime impression) that it will execute its mission to destroy all Evangelions.\n\nShort confession, until a couple of days ago I hadn't watched a single episode of the original Evangelion. In the process of rectifying that, I watched the episode that featured Jet Alone. Without giving too much away, Jet Alone's “threat” in the episode was that it was seemingly malfunctioning and running in a straight line towards a nearby city. Its statblock in the GM's kit is slightly more potent, as it assumes that JA is actually armed and programmed to take its targets, and even then it's assumed that the players would have an easy time taking it down. Heck, the GM's kit flat-out says that the more dangerous aspect of Jet Alone is its nuclear reactor, which will melt down if it is compromised. In retrospect, this makes this incarnation of Jet Alone even more salty.\n\nBecause remember that above threat? In the first turn of combat, Jet Alone rotated its shoulder-mounted positron cannon into firing position and put an energy blast straight between the eyes of an Evangelion. Said blast took the Eva's head clean off of its shoulders.\n\nNaturally, the four remaining Evangelions fell on Jet Alone and tried to kick the shit out of it. It took down two more Evas to my recollection, Speedy's and what I think was an NPC. Only Aiden and Huey were left in the fight near the end, doing their damnedest to stop this Diablo ex machina. Once again, we found out that the GM had upped the armor to deal with the sort of firepower he'd imagined we'd throw at the thing, because scratching Jet Alone was much more difficult than it should have been. The fight (and the crowd) basically belonged to Jet Alone, and in a few turns the remaining Evangelions would run out of power.\n\nIn retrospect, simply running out of power would have been better. See, the Evas did manage to breach the armor of Jet Alone and compromise its reactor. It was kind of inevitable, given that Jet Alone's biggest weakness was its core. That bad news was that this changed our priorities. The Evangelions with their AT Fields still spread would survive the blast  just fine, but everyone within the complex would be incinerated, as would the helpless pilots and our own UN entourage. The fallout would render another state fallow for centuries, if the Angels didn't wipe humanity out first. There was no way to stop this blast, but there was no way Aiden could stand for that. She wouldn't let life be wiped out right in front of her eyes.\n\nWracking my brain, I suddenly realized what I had to do. There was one way to reduce Jet Alone's potential bodycount to one. There was an action I could take that would guarantee the future of the Evangelion project while saving the lives of the people in the complex. And all it required was one goth girl to take the nuclear bullet.\n\nI burned fate, and announced my intentions to die stopping this thing. Now, in all honesty, I was cheesing the GM here. I had no AT abilities that would allow me to actually do this. I didn't even really have a cohesive plan. I was just running on the rules of Dark Heresy's fate point system, rules that allowed you to sacrifice a character in a blaze of glory. It was the only action I could take that encapsulated what Aiden wanted at that moment.\n\nIf I took one lesson away from this nightmare, it was to never cheese the GM. Because while the GM hadn't planned on me doing something like this, the GM very quickly came up with an answer for my sacrifice. Something that ran completely counter to what I was hoping to accomplish.\n\nWith a horrible shriek, Unit-05 began to change. Its armor peeled off like snakeskin, revealing stronger skin underneath. Wings of light began to emit from its back, and its AT Field shot up in power. As this happened, Aiden's own willpower began to drop. Rapidly.\n\nTo my horror, the GM informed me that I'd unleashed the Angel part of my Evangelion.\n\nIn a single move, the Angel disdainfully smashed Jet Alone into scrap metal. Its AT Field continued to expand and its body continued to morph as every human within its radius dissolved into orange mush. All the while Aiden had to test her willpower against the angel, which began to sound like her own mother. It was here the GM revealed his hand. Aiden's mother had died because her soul was in this machine, and Aiden's decision to die gloriously had brought her to the fore. So now as Aiden was desperately trying to reign in the disaster she had created she was being lectured about the way of the world. Mother dearest spoke of how humanity was an evolutionary dead-end, and how Aiden throwing her life away wouldn't prevent them from inevitably going extinct. And mother/mech wasn't having that.\n\nAiden rolled opposed willpower with her mech twice, and tied. Each roll got more difficult, as Aiden's own willpower was dissolved inside what used to be her cockpit. On the outside, the Angel got more godly. Within a couple turns, statistics became meaningless. I was on fire at that moment at the table. I was on my feet, leaning on the table like a drunk and hoping that the next roll would be a crit success. At that moment, literally nothing outside of the game mattered to me.\n\nI wish I could say I succeeded enough times on the dice to maintain control. I didn't.\n\nAiden's willpower dropped to zero, and she became nothing more than a ghost in a machine. Now unfettered, the newborn Angel turned its contempt on humanity. I profusely apologized to the other players and the GM. I never intended for this to happen.\n\nOf course, there was one last saving throw for the GM. As Speedwagon's pilot listened in, NERV base gave Huey the order to “do it.” Again the GM reveals his hand: Huey is this game's Kaworu Nagisa, and the “it” in question is the ability to transform into a degenerating clone of Adam, the progenitor of all Angels.\n\nThe combat is quick and brutal. The Aiden Angel is torn apart by Adam, which eats its core. Adam then degenerates into a brain-dead husk. Both Aiden and Huey are dead.\n\nThis caps the campaign. We discuss continuing it, but the GM can't think of a good way to do so. The Evangelion project just exploded with the force of a world-ending bomb, most of the units have been dismantled and the pilots killed, and everyone in the state of Texas is a blob of goo. NERV is over, and any effective weapon against the Angels is out of commission. The two most compelling characters, Speedwagon and Aiden, are now dead as doornails, and replacing them is going to be an impossible sell. Even if we were to roll up literal expies of Kamina, there was no combat encounter the GM could cook up that could possibly surpass the hype, or perhaps the disappointment, of that final encounter.\n\nThere are worse ways to end a campaign, but not many.",

        "text": "Minor Spoiler Warning for the Pathfinder campaign Serpent's Skull. I think we're late in book 1 or 2, not sure.\n\nLet me begin by saying that Elien, the party druid, does not particularly care for my character. Mercer is a bit of a self-proclaimed ladies man and Elien often tuts her disapproval every time we make it back into a town and Mercer immediately embarks on a bender to pick up women for him and his best mate (the Grippli cleric).\n\nTraversing through the jungle the party finds four women playing innocently in the river we were following. Pretty obvious set-up for a trap. Why not spring it? Mercer walks over and begins chatting up the ladies. Turns out one of them is their matron, though still bitchin' hot, and the other three are Spirit Dancers. They see that we've been to the Spirit Realm and invite us back to their hut to converse on our travels. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWhile at the hut Elric does some subtle magic and discovers that the three young dancers are actually enchanted and are being forced to serve the matron. The matron catches Elric in the act and shows her true colors: she's a Succubus! Combat ensues and immediately things go to hell when Mercer gets charmed and starts to head back to the bedroom with one of the dancers. (Yes, he was actually charmed and didn't willingly abandong the party.)\n\nThrough a series of events very difficult to convey, Mercer gets enchanted again and is attempting to protect the Succubus by attacking his best friend and party-healer, Willup. Elric casts Web and we're all basically stuck in a hut, flailing at each other. Willup breaks free and starts stabbing the Succubus who's been subsequently blinded from Elien. Fearing for her life, the Succubus demands that Mercer kiss her so she can suck out his soul and regain some strength.\n\nElien panics. She can't get to the Succubus due to the Web and Mercer being between them but she can't let Mercer get killed/heal the baddie. So she does what she can: she grabs Mercer's face and plants a big ole wet one on his lips.\n\nMercer snaps out of his trance and decides that this is okay with him and continues the kiss for another round (19 on a bluff check to still act charmed), all the while the other two party members are desperately trying to kill the Succubus. Mercer, still kissing Elien, knocks out one of the enthralled dancers as she tries to tackle Elien to break the kiss. Mercer finally breaks the kiss for air, gives her a wink and says \"We'll continue this later.\" He helps keep enemies at bay while the wizard and the cleric finish off the baddie and we free the dancers from their bonds.\n\nNow we have a druid who is embarassed, pissed, and fuming at the unscathed swashbuckler who is high fiving the other male members of the party that \"I knew she was into me.\" I'll update next week to see if Mercer survives the wrath of Elien.",

This is a continuation of [Shadowrun 4th Edition] This is Who We Are: Part 1, which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5cv9zd/shadowrun_4th_edition_this_is_who_we_are_part_1/. Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment or send me a private message. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThe following tale has no grounding in real life. Any resemblance to people real or fictional is entirely coincidental and hilarious. Please, ABSOLUTELY try running Shadowrun at home.\n\nIt would be difficult to pinpoint, Jana felt, the exact moment that things had gone wrong. Was it the decision to attack a band of roving go-gangers? Allowing Patu to sit in the back with their package? The choice to have all four of them jammed together into a single vehicle, against all common sense? No, she decided as bullets ricocheted off of the asphalt around her. It was probably when they took this job.\n\n72 hours earlier, the fledgling team sat around the bar counter of a sleazy Auckland dive named the Moa Ranch. Each of them was at ease, chatting idly, while the regular patrons gave them a wide berth; it was a well known rule at the Ranch that anyone who felt at home around murderers and thieves was not someone you wanted to offend. Patu went to take a drink before finding out that his glass was lamentably empty. \n\n\"Oi, Mason.\" He called to the bartender, earning an irritated look from the burly ork. \"Another round, mate. Put it on Miss Johnson's tab.\" Mason rolled his eyes but complied, filling another pint with beer. Patu turned back around to his friends with a wide grin. \"Same thing, folks?\" Jana shook her head, putting a hand over her glass. \"Fair enough, gotta keep your head for negotiations. Kahu?\" She nodded in return, glaring at a pack of drunken gangers who were eyeing her off. \n\n\"Beer's good, thanks Mason.\" She called across the bar, shooting the beleaguered man a rare smile. \"Maybe let this one hit the table before you chug it.\" Kahu remarked. Patu mimed someone talking and turned to Burnie. \"How about you, Fat-Man? Having something stronger than water?\" When Burnie shook his head, Patu sighed in faux regret. \"Dark days when the alcoholic won't drink anymore.\" \n\n\"Took me a while to kick the habit and I'm not in a hurry to pick it back up.\" The transporter smiled politely at his team-mate. Patu scoffed, tapping his empty glass against the bar-top.\n\n\"Yeah, you're a real boy-scout.\" He muttered petulantly. Jana and Burnie exchanged amused smiles. Kahu glanced up at the AR overview of the bar, noting the chronometer that blazed in the air. \n\n\"Client's late. Never a good sign.\" The hacker growled under her breath. As if by magic, the door creaked open at her words and a well-dressed elven woman stepped inside. Kahu pulled a face at the timing but spun around with the others. Their client was the standard Megacorp greeter, all pristine hair and coldly polite smiles. She smoothed down the collar of her 3000 nuyen suit and stepped over to them. She was either unaware or uncaring of the looks levelled her way. \n\n\"Good morning everyone. I believe that we should get down to business.\" The runners recognised it as a command rather than a request and responded appropriately. They led her to a private booth, Kahu activating a white noise generator as she sat, before the Johnson spoke again. \"Thank you all for meeting me here. Now, I represent an organisation that requires a task to be completed and your team has been recommended for the task.\" With a quick flick of her wrist, she sent a data file to everyone present.\n\n\"Escort detail? Fuck me, that's dull.\" Patu grumbled before wincing as Jana jabbed an elbow into his ribs. \"But one that we would be more than happy to complete.\" The Johnson grinned, the first real display of emotion since she had entered the bar. \n\n\"Obviously I can't tell you the details unless you accept. I can inform you that your package would be alive and must be unharmed upon arrival, with the destination being in New Zealand.\" Miss Johnson slipped back into business mode, reciting the information as if it was from a script. \"You would also be rewarded with a not insignificant sum: 10000 nuyen each.\" Patu whistled appreciatively.\n\n\"The Wall could use a few upgrades.\" Burnie mused quietly. Kahu chewed on her lip but remained silent. After all, this was Jana's job. \n\n\"That sounds like a large amount of money for a relatively simple job, which makes me think that it's not so simple.\" She smiled brightly, leaning forward with one finger gently tracing the rim of her glass. \"You're a professional and I'm sure that you've been given quite the budget to work with here. So, here's the deal: You'll bump that figure up to 15000 each and pay for our expenses for this trip. In exchange, we'll make sure that you're poppet gets there safe and sound.\" Jana smiled with all of the kindness of a Great White, waiting to sink her teeth into a juicy morsel.\n\n\"Done.\" The answer arrived instantly. The negotiators shook hands, recognising each other as worthwhile conversation. Kahu, Patu and Burnie continued sipping at their drinks with expectant looks on their faces. Jana ignored her colleagues in favour of probing the client for more information.\n\n\"So, who are we protecting?\" She asked. The Johnson answered without hesitation, the smile fixed to her face.\n\n\"Kiah Alison. Female. 16 years of age. Elf.\" Jana laughed gleefully as Burnie winced. \n\n\"A teenager. Excellent. Alright, speed round. Condition on arrival?\" \n\n\"Unharmed in any way, shape or form.\" \n\n\"Where are we transporting her and from where?\"\n\n\"You are to pick her up from Waiorapa Airport in two days and then deliver her to the location marked in the dossier.\" Miss Johnson gestured and each of their commlinks pinged with an acknowledgement.\n\n\"We'll need passes to access the secure zones.\"\n\n\"Done and done.\"\n\n\"Potential threats?\" \n\n\"The area has been plagued with gang activity as of late but nothing you should not be able to handle.\" \n\n\"Who's the job for?\" It went against runner etiquette to ask a Johnson who they represented; tradition held that you could try to find out yourself but Shadowrunners were a deniable asset for a reason. The Johnson moved to answer before smiling politely. \n\n\"Irrelevant.\" Jana smirked smugly before leaning back with her arms folded.\n\n\"Any addendums?\" The Johnson shook her head in a controlled motion. \"Excellent. Alright girls and boys, we're done here.\" Patu blinked in confusion before shaking is head violently.\n\n\"Wait, what? What the fuck just happened?\" The mystic adept questioned with mild concern. Kahu patted him on the shoulder, a wolf's leer on her face.\n\n\"Try not to think too hard on it. There be witchcraft here.\" She wiggled her fingers at him mockingly before standing, arms stretching out. \"Miss Johnson, we'll be in touch.\" Kahu's statement roused the others to action and they rose accordingly. With a shared nod, the group split up and moved away from each other: Burnie left by the front door, Jana by the back, Kahu slipped out the bathroom window and Patu settled down at the bar. It was going to be an interesting week, the mystic adept mused to himself.\n\nIt was a silent drive to the airport as each of the shadow-runners prepared themselves for the task ahead. Burnie piloted the Wall, his customised military Humvee, with surprising grace for such a large vehicle. All of them were dressed in seemingly casual clothing, kevlar fibre woven through their suits. A large duffel bag sat at Patu's feet, the large Maori reclining in the Wall's back seat with a casual ease. Beside the heavy vehicle, a motorcycle roared across the asphalt. Suited in biker leathers and helmet, Kahu acted as out-rider for the team. She arrived at the private terminal first, flashing their AR credentials silently. The guards processed the documentation wordlessly before allowing the gates to open.\n\n\"We're in. If everything goes according to plan, the target's plane should be arriving in five minutes.\" Kahu growled across the comms. \"I'm going stationary for a while, doing Matrix security. Patu, walk the perimeter.\" He obeyed, though reluctantly. Burnie pulled the Wall to a stop and Jana stepped outside. \"By the books, people.\" Kahu snarled before cutting her signal off. True to form, the private jet arrived exactly five minutes later. Moments after touchdown, the boarding ramp deployed and their package appeared.\n\n\"Thank you Captain Reinhardt! Have a good flight home!\" She gushed, her voice high and perky. The elven woman practically skipped down the stairs, waving jauntily behind her. Jana smiled at her as she reached the ground, offering the girl a hand. \n\n\"Kiah, right?\" Jana's voice was professional yet welcoming. \n\n\"That's right! I think we're going to be great friends!\" Kiah gushed, wrapping her arms around the mercenary operative. \"So, what's your name?\" Jana smiled sharply, holding back the urge to slit her target's throat.\n\n\"How about we do introductions on the road?\" Kiah gasped in excitement, clapping her hands together excitedly. Jana gestured for her to head to the Wall, a smile fixed to her face. Kiah all but ran over to the stationary vehicle with an amazed gleam in her eye while her escort activated a sub-vocal microphone with a low sigh. \"Kill me now, we have to spend three hours with this?\" Burnie snorted once before opening the door for Kiah. \n\n\"Well, I think she's lovely.\" Patu breathed in awe, his eyes locked with the giggly teenager. \"Why don't you sit with me, sweetheart?\" He coaxed tenderly and Kiah complied happily, shifting into the centre seat with a wide smile on her face. \"What brings such a pretty lady such as yourself out here?\" Jana flopped heavily into the passenger seat, trying to comprehend what she was hearing. She and Burnie exchanged confused looks for a moment before shrugging. He was a skirt-chaser by nature, so it wasn't unheard of.\n\n\"Clear for departure?\" Kahu asked icily. She received a ping of acknowledgement from Jana and Burnie, impatiently waiting for the final signal. \"Patu, are we good?\" She barked into the communicator, earning a hasty ping in return. \"Good. Let's roll.\" \n\nThe procession left with little fan-fare, Kahu roaring almost a kilometre ahead to scan for threats while the others followed diligently. She radioed in status reports every two minutes like clockwork and the trip was relatively uneventful, other than Patu flirting with their very receptive package.\n\n\"Wow, you're a magician? That's pretty awesome.\" Jana and Burnie struggled to keep a straight face as Kiah gushed over Patu, the bulky Maori puffing up with pride.\n\n\"Technically, I'm a mystic adept. We're much rarer.\" He declared with a smug smirk. Patu flexed his muscles and a bolt of electricity crackled over his skin before dissipating harmlessly. Kiah gasped in excitement, clapping her hands merrily.\n\n\"That's amazing! What else can you do?\" She asked in awe, her eyes wide in delight. \n\n\"Sorry, Miss Alison but we're on the job. Patu has to keep an eye on things astrally for us.\" Jana told their client, a sickly-sweet smile on her face. \"So we're going to have to drag him away from you, okay sweetie?\" Kiah whined in disappointment while Patu glared at Jana over his sun-glasses. \"Otherwise something might happen to you and no-one wants that, do we Patu?\" The rebuke fell upon deaf ears but he paused at the thought of something happening to Kiah. Patu settled into his seat with a huff, crossing his arms. It remained uneventful until halfway through their journey when Kahu reported in with an edge to her tone. \n\n\"Biker gang, coming down the highway. No other traffic in sight. If it's an ambush, this would be the time.\" The group began to respond, even Patu pulling himself away from Kiah's allure. The fleet of motorcycles screamed down the motorway: a dozen go-gangers in total, proudly flying their colours. For a moment, it seemed almost as if an altercation was unavoidable but the swarm continued without slowing. \"Contact?\" Kahu questioned as she circle them once, prepared for a conflict.\n\n\"No contact, all clear. Let's keep going.\" Burnie responded. With nothing else to do, Kahu squealed away from the team and they followed shortly after. Less than a minute later, Kahu reported in again.\n\n\"Contact. One car, pulled over, emergency lights on. Might be a decoy, try to keep the philanthropist from seeing. We can't afford slowing down.\" The Wall trundled along as Kahu continued her observation. \"Small group of gangers moving in on him. Smells like a set-up by someone who knows our target.\" Burnie agreed, slowing down as they arrived to the bend that Kahu had indicated. \n\n\"What's going on?\" Kiah asked in concern, leaning forward in her seat. Kahu closed her eyes and inhaled sharply before turning with a friendly grin.\n\n\"Nothing, sweetheart. One of our friends is just looking out ahead for anything that might be a problem for us.\" She reassured the flighty girl. Burnie accelerated, trying to move past the situation without any problem. \n\n\"Who is that?\" Kiah pointed out the windshield at a figure, standing to the side of the road. The man wore tattered clothing and was waving his hands at them desperately, a deflated tire abandoned on the road behind him. \"He looks like he needs our help!\" She exclaimed, putting a hand on Patu's knee. In the distance, Kahu was returning to the group; a small fleet of bikers hot on her heels.\n\n\"We can't afford to stop, Miss Kiah. I'm sure he'll be fine.\" Burnie tried to appease her but Kiah only grew more frantic. \n\n\"No, we have to stop and help him.\" Kiah ordered, in a way that indicated she was used to getting what she wanted. When Burnie continued driving, she stomped her foot on the floor and shouted. \"We have to help him, right now!\" Kiah turned to Patu with a pleading look, her eyes tearing up already. \"Please, Patu. I couldn't bear it if something happened to him when we could have done something.\" Patu had faced down elite security forces, rampaging earth elementals and black-ops mercenaries without flinching. Kiah looking at him like he was her personal saviour? There was no chance.\n\n\"We're stopping. Pull over, Fat Man.\" The mystic adept ordered. Burnie scoffed quietly, unwavering from his course. Patu frowned and leaned forward, putting a meaty paw on the driver's shoulder. \"Maybe you didn't hear me, friend. Pull over. Now.\" Burnie glanced at his companion in the rear-view mirror , eyes narrowed. \"Right, fuck you then.\" Patu snarled and yanked the hand-brake up. The car slid to a screeching halt just before the waving individual, as Burnie fought to control their turbulent flight. Patu was already out of the car by the time his driver turned with a furious look on his face.\n\n\"Kia ora, mate.\" Patu strode forward, unconcerned by the encroaching fleet of vehicles, and greeted the stranded man. \"What seems to be the trouble?\" He smiled when the man ran to him and grasped him by the shoulders. \n\n\"Oh thank god. Thank you for stopping.\" The man whimpered, relieved. \"I didn't know what I was going to do if no-one pulled over.\" He twitched, jerking to the side, when Kahu pulled up alongside.\n\n\"Patu, what the fuck are you doing?\" She growled at him. \"Get back in the fucking car.\" Patu flipped her off idly, eyes locked on the bikers pulling up behind her. \"For fuck's sake.\" Kahu sighed angrily, hand going to the pistol strapped to her thigh. The biker's scattered around them with a whoop of glee, trying to use their numbers to intimidate. The lead ganger opened his mouth to speak when Kahu shot him in the face. \"Let's wrap this up and move on.\" She ordered. \n\n\"Fucking A.\" Patu exclaimed darkly, pushing the man aside gently. His lightning aura screamed to life as he charged towards them with a length of greenstone in one hand.\n\n\"Goddamn it!\" Jana shrieked, leaping out of the car with her sidearm drawn. The ensuing firefight was brief but bloody; none of the runners taking any significant damage while the biker's corpses lay scattered across the road. \n\n\"Holy shit.\" The stranded man breathed out, surveying the carnage. \n\n\"Yeah, we're pretty awesome.\" Patu chuckled, wiping blood off of his weapon on his most recent victim. Kahu and Jana glared at him, their trigger fingers twitching violently. Whatever colourful byplay was about to occur was interrupted by horrified screaming from the Wall. They turned as one, seeing Alison staring out at them with a hand over her mouth. \"Ah bollocks.\" Patu sighed. \"Listen, sweetheart...\" Kiah refused to let him answer. \n\n\"You murdered those people! How could you?\" Her shrill cries ripped through the air, making everyone wince in pain. \n\n\"They were going to try and kill this fellow here.\" Patu gestured weakly, receiving a vigorous nod of support from the hitch-hiker. \n\n\"You don't know that! They might have been stopping to help.\" The teenager cried out, jabbing an accusatory at Patu. \"Imagine pulling up to help some poor, stranded person and being murdered for your troubles!\" Kahu twitched violently, leather creaking as her gloved hands clenched tightly.\n\n\"Alright, that's unlikely.\" Patu reasoned, cocking his head to the side. \"What if they weren't as nice as you think they were? Maybe they really were trying to kill the poor bastard, you know?\" The Maori wrapped one arm around his grateful friend. \"Would you really want me to let that happen?\" Patu entreated, a grin on his face.\n\n\"Get away from him.\" Kiah screamed, sprinting to their side. She forced the duo away from each other, wrapping a protective arm around the stranded man. \"Come with me, sweetheart. We'll take you wherever you need to go.\" She coaxed him gently, shepherding the bewildered individual back to the Wall. Jana went to object before Kiah silenced her with a glare. \"He's coming with us or I'm staying.\" The girl threatened, a scowl across her face. Jana grit her teeth before smiling.\n\n\"Of course, dear. Why don't you both take a seat?\" She asked them politely. Minutes later, the Wall was trundling along the lonely road. It was a tense atmosphere within the vehicle as Kiah huddled in the back seat with her confused 'friend' smiling awkwardly as she reassured him that nothing would happen to him. Her comfort did little to ease his concern, judging by the look on his face. Patu sat across from them, glaring at their newest acquisition with a jealous fury. Jana and Burnie tried to keep a straight face; it was a valiant effort but the battle was lost before it began. \n\n\"So, what's your name?\" Patu growled, meaty paws clenching his knees. A warning spark of lightning illuminated the mystic adept's dark glasses for a moment.\n\n\"Kevin.\" The man introduced slowly, eyes darting from Patu to Burnie and Jana. \"Thank you again for picking me up. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't.\" Jana went very still, her body tensing momentarily, before she twisted slowly. There was a lazy grin across her face as she addressed the new arrival.\n\n\"That's quite alright, Kevin. Do you mind if I ask where you were headed?\" She questioned casually, propping her chin up in one hand.\n\n\"I was heading into Auckland for a business trip.\" He answered almost immediately. Jana nodded along. Her manicured nails tapped a rhythm against the dashboard, the sharp click-clack unnerving Kevin.\n\n\"So what's the job?\" The man looked at her, startled. \"What do you do, I mean.\" Jana amended. Her smile transformed slowly into a Cheshire Cat grin as she noticed the momentary panic on Kevin's face.\n\n\"Oh! It's not very interesting, I'm an accountant.\" The man shrugged, almost as if he was embarrassed by his own employment. \"Just heading into Auckland to correct a client's mistake.\" He smiled back at the shadowrunner, seemingly unconcerned by her predatory expression.\n\n\"I bet you are. What happened to your spare tire?\" The tone of Jana's questions had changed; the conversation more of an interrogation than anything. Patu shifted in his seat, leaning forward to regard his nemesis with a new clarity. Kevin sat a little straighter, one of his hands slipping into a pocket. \n\n\"What spare tire?\" Kevin deflected quickly, leaning into Kiah. The girl glared warningly at her chaperones but they ignored her.\n\n\"The spare tire that you popped so we would stop and help you.\" Patu rumbled with dark satisfaction, having come to the same conclusion that Jana had. Kevin smiled amicably before twisting suddenly, lunging at Kiah with a syringe. He jabbed the needle towards her slender neck with professional precision and might have succeeded had Patu not seized his wrist with a negligent gesture. \n\n\"Some days, being a runner sucks. You get paid shitty money, you get shot at by every motherfucker under the sun and there's always a target on your ass.\" He dragged Kevin forward until the assassin was recoiling from Patu's breath. \"And then there are days like today.\" Burnie accelerated, the Wall tearing down the highway with reckless abandon. Patu chuckled darkly, hauling Kevin up by his arm with such force that the shoulder popped free. His victim barely had time to scream before the door flung open and he followed shortly after. Kiah screeched in horror, scrabbling forward to try and save him. Patu held her back effortlessly, the tiny teenager barely shifting his considerable bulk with her exertion.\n\n\"Sorry, love. Some people really aren't good for you.\" Patu chirped perkily, closing the door with one hand and closing the door with the other. \"Oi, Fat Man. Did he bounce?\" Burnie glanced at the rear view mirror before shaking his head. \n\n\"Nope. He smeared.\" The driver intoned quietly. Patu laughed mirthfully, the sound rumbling from deep in his belly. It took almost a full ten minutes for his hysterical guffawing to subside, with Kiah growing more and more agitated as he laughed.\n\n\"Fucking excellent! Let's drop the little lady off and go for beers!\" His declaration was met with muted cheering from Burnie and Kahu, the hacker broadcasting her assent through their secure channel. Their client slumped over in her chair, her eyes glazed over from shock, and was silent for the remainder of their journey.\n\nOne hour later, Kiah was slowly exiting the Wall with the assistance of a man dressed in native garb. He and Patu exchanged a respectful nod the head while Jana contacted the Johnson with a pleased smile. There was a digital notification on each of their commlinks and the team rejoiced as their bank accounts swelled with payment. Patu waved Kiah away with a dopey smile, though it waned as she ignored him completely and continued on to the stone pillars jutting up from the landscape. He thumped into the Wall with a dejected sigh, stroking Mjolnir to comfort himself. Jana and Burnie exchanged amused glances before the Wall rumbled to life. They pulled away from the delivery site and Jana patted Patu on the knee with a teasing smile.\n\n\"There, there. Don't worry, we'll find you another impressionable young thing to corrupt later.\" Her tone was tauntingly sweet but Patu seemed ignorant to it, nodding along in acceptance.\n\n\"I know, I know.\" He stared out at the countryside wistfully, watching as lightning flashed across clear skies and the earth shook in warning. Patu felt the air tremble as arcane energies flooded the stone circle behind them. \"It just won't be the same.\"\n",

        "text": "I posted this on /r/dnd, completely unaware of this sub\nThat post is located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5hersc/the_one_time_i_let_someone_try_and_bargain_with/?st=1Z141Z3&amp;sh=2741945f).\nSomeone there linked me to this and I figured if it hit off well there, why not post it here!\n\nSo my group's party was in the middle of combat with 20-some goblins, and as low-level characters, they were essentially outnumbered. \nOur War-forged Berserker was in the middle of a berserker rage, slashing enemies left and right, doing fairly well.\nOur Dwarf Cleric had been missing rolls consistently throughout combat, and was getting extremely exasperated. A goblin had jumped on his back, and started shanking him with its dagger.\nThe Berserker attempted to attack the goblin on the Dwarf's Back with his two-handed sword (bad idea in the first place), but rolled a crit fail on to-hit.\nI asked for the Berserker to roll for damage, and he rolled a 10.\nOur cleric was basically cut clean in half and was killed instantly (the damage was enough to kill him twice over. Once again, these are low level characters).\n\nI expected the cleric to throw a fit, seeing as we just barely had started the campaign a session ago, but he remained calm.\nHe explained to me his devout allegiance to his deity, and all the deeds he had done in favor of his god in the short time he had played, and then asked to simply roll to convince his deity to resurrect him.\nI gave him the d20, and was trying to figure what a good number would be for him to target, when he rolled a Nat 20.\nThe table cheered and I sat for a few moments trying to figure out how you could be critically resurrected.\nEventually I decided on a good choice with our War-forged (a veteran D&amp;D player, I consult him on issues I have no clue how to handle issues alone as the DM).\n\nOur cleric would need to make a Resurrection save. If succeeded he would take a permanent 1d4 hit to constitution, and his body and items would be destroyed in the process. However, he would be resurrected with full health, decked out in natural chitin/bone-like armor, with a mace of similar material. His alignment would be forced from TN to CN, and he would be considered \"bloodthirsty\".\n\nI let our party play for a few turns before I resurrected the Cleric.\nThey had killed all but one of the goblins when it happened.\nThe corpse of the Cleric swelled up and exploded, spattering the room with his remains, and broken pieces of whatever items he had.\nThere stood the cleric, dripping with blood and god-knows-what, wearing nothing but the natural armor, carrying the mace.\nEveryone at the table except the War-forged and I were totally shocked, and the Cleric gained a surprise round on the remaining goblin.\n\nHe attacked the goblin, and once again nat 20'd, much to my surprise.\nThe goblin sailed out the door, hit the wall of the ravine outside, and slid down slowly to the bottom of the ravine.\n\nThe party took a little bit to fully adjust to what just happened.\n\nEveryone was very satisfied with the results of the resurrection in the long run\n\nUpdate from tonight's session: \nThe cleric cut off the head of the goblin king and presented it to the mayor of the town\nNeedless to say, he rolled very well in intimidating the mayor\nOur party got horses and replenished supplies, and are soon to have a plaque on the mayor's wall with the skull and their names\n\nIf anyone is interested with more of this campaign, give me a heads up and I might post more stories :)",

        "title": "Don Quixote's moment of comeuppance [Dark Heresy]",
        "author": "Dakkaface",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5hbibc/don_quixotes_moment_of_comeuppance_dark_heresy/",
        "text": "Well, In my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5fzp0p/don_quixote_the_cheater/), I talked about the misadventures of Don Quixote and I mentioned a moment of comeuppance he got in the finale of a Dark Heresy campaign. This is that story.\n\nIt was long campaign - the game started at 3 players with your standard 400xp characters, and by the end of it, the party had expanded to 6 players and we had hit Ascension ranks for the last few sessions at the end.  The whole thing had progressed for about a year, year and a half. In the very first mission, we're introduced to the macguffin - a crystallized orb formed from killing a hiveworld's population and collecting their souls.  It's a psychically powerful doodad that we have stolen, transported, protected, and eventually, lost.  The campaign's villain, a crazed Inquisitor, had managed to steal it, and we knew only that him having it was **bad news**.\n\nWe get tipped off by an Eldar Farseer that the mad Inquisitor is going to use the ancient Webway portal behind the Golden Throne to pop into the Throne Room and use the psychic macguffin in a device to shut down the Astronomicon and kill the Emperor. This fits with neither our goals nor Eldar plots, so they are going to let us through the webway with a Harlequin guide to help us get there in time like Big Damn Heroes.\n\nWe follow him through the breach, let in by the Farseer, and interrupted the BBEG as he set up his Emperor-slaying device by showing up with OUR Inquisitor and alerting the Custodes. Having seen his chance evaporate, the madman chucks a stasis grenade at the Custodes and decides that if he can't kill the Big E with the macguffin, he'll use it another way, and more or less *eats it* to become a Daemon Prince right on the steps of the Golden Throne– 20 feet of Warp-twisted flesh and unnatural power ready to rend us all limb from limb. The fight begins in earnest.\n\nNow, if you are at all familiar Dark Heresy, instead of critical hits, it has a rule called Righteous Fury - essentially, instead of getting critical hits with a set multiplier, your damage dice explode (roll max damage and you get another die of the same type.). The GM tells us that as we are literally under the eye of the Emperor – Righteous Fury will happen on a 9 or 10 instead of just on 10's.\n\nThis helps a bit during the fight, as the Daemon-Inquisitor now has some ludicrous toughness and daemonic resilience in addition to his armor. Everyone is chipping away at its health and generally triggering extra dice every turn or two. Mr. Quixote is doing pretty well - he's doing the usual of grabbing dice rolls and declaring them successes, or 'forgetting' some modifiers and declaring his failure was actually a success after some 'mental math.' So he's doing consistent damage, but not pushing his luck by cheating on damage rolls.\n\nThe daemon prince eventually gets down to very low health and screams that it will not fail. The Don describes some fancy acrobatics where he stabs the daemon with a knife, climbs up to its shoulders, and shoots it in the head. He starts to launch into what I can only guess was going to be a long winded speech about evil, and justice, and -I don't know what else because the GM stops him and says he can't get that far in one round. His climactic headshot with blessed ammunition will have to wait til next round, as his actions for this round were a knife attack and the Acrobatics check to climb up the daemon's body.\n\nDon is miffed, but unconcerned - as only two characters have blessed weapons, most of what is being done is scratch damage - he can vanquish the Daemon on his next turn.\n\nI am the only other character with a blessed weapon. I'm a taciturn, melee focused Templar Psykana-build Psyker. So my turn rolls around and I use Lightning Attack to strike this monster thrice with a blessed force blade. I have been doing pretty good damage thanks to my blessed blade and a high static damage modifer, but haven't been doing anything amazing, particularly since with only one damage die, I haven't been triggering Righteous Fury the way that Don's bolt pistol or the party's other multi-shot, multiple die weapons have been.\n\nI hit twice, and on one of the two attacks, my one die comes up 9. Roll again for confirmation, got it. Roll again. 10. Again.  9.  Mr. Quixote looks concerned now. Again. 9. Again. 10. The GM, myself and the other players are currently sporting shit-eating grins. Again. 9. Again. 10. Mr. Quixote looks like he's swallowed a lemon. Again. 10, Again. 7. The run finally closes. Final damage count after static mods was in the 90's.The Daemon Prince was vanquished in a flurry of Emperor-granted might that most of the table found an incredible capstone to an epic campaign.  Truly, the Emperor smiled on us that day - though he clearly did so with a wink at the rest of us that the Don did not get. ",

        "text": "Playing as the merchant king of Amalfi. My commercial empire has dominated the western Mediterranean, holding Spain, North Africa, southern Italy, and Jerusalem for a short period. My son is has the genius trait and I notice that the daughter of the Byzantine basileos is also a genius, so I get them betrothed. I've worked hard to keep good relations with the Byzantines, join their holy wars and sending gifts. As things continue, I notice the relations declining. Something is happening, a storm is brewing. One thunderous night, my spymaster bursts into my bed chamber and warns me that they have caught an assassin. His employer? The Basileos. The father of the girl my heir is to marry. This cannot be allowed to continue. Our children shall be wed and their children shall create a just and mighty rule, controlling the union of two worlds with wisdom and wit. I let this one slide, and invite the Basileos over to mend our relationship.\n\nOver the years things continue as normal. I die and my genius son takes over. He has grown into a powerful ruler. Even as a young despot of 16, everyone loves him and his delicious traits. Just two more years until Princess Rodanthe comes of age and we can become wed. We spent years playing together, knowing that we would be able to spend eternity together with our badass traits. We had even spent our education going back and forth between each others' homelands. Little did I know what her wretched snake of a father had planned. He broke the betrothal 3 weeks before she came of age and set her up with some old triple chinned fuckwit vassal who was threatening rebellion. Accepting this fate and needing a shell of a queen to pop out heirs, I married a vassal's widowed lustful sister. A lowborn whore as far as I was concerned. She didn't even have good traits. Rodanthe had grown to become a beautiful woman and when the Basileos croaked, she was next in line and had become the female regnant of the Byzantine empire.\n\nI had lost my taste for life. None of my children inherited my genius trait. My wife would sit around complaining about jewelry. I would just buy her a bird or a horse or whatever to keep her empty mind occupied with triflings. What a vapid woman. I knew where my true love lie. So I took the Seduction focus and went for it. There she was. In the candle-lit halls of the palace. It happened. Our passion for life was reignited. For years we snuck around, simulating what could have been. But things could only be so good for so long. She gave birth to my child. A genius. Her slimy husband, a pathetic excuse for a sperm donor, knew it wasn't his. How could it be? The child was amazing and he was not. My wife began to suspect things, as she finally gained some form of sentience I suppose. Put in a tough spot and needing to keep her position secure, Rodanthe cut things off, but I was not ready to let these hooligans stand in our way.\n\nPerhaps I was too persistent, too aggressive. Perhaps I wanted to do what was best for our bastard, whom we loved more than any of our other children, for he was the symbol of our love. She started to grow weary. Age and struggle brings people down. Our vassals had increased tensions. The Byzantines had long held a single county on Italy, one that I tolerated for centuries. One of my vassals, maybe out of nationalism for his glorious merchant empire, decided enough was enough and went ahead to try and oust the Greeks from Italy. That war came to a stalemate. And then the levy broke. Rodanthe declared war. She went around destroying the trade posts I held on her land. From that point on we were bitter rivals. We violently struck each other on a global scale. The two largest powers in the world going head to head. War after war. Some I won, some she won. We opened a cold war arms race by racing to conquer the newly fractured Georgia. Over the years I became tired. I became old. What had happened to us? We used to be friends. We used to be engaged. We used to be lovers. Now we throw away the lives of men, almost 100k men each by the end, in our petty squabbles, in our cosmic spats. After a struggle with pneumonia, Rodanthe passed away, and the throne fell to our bastard child. I could not legitimize him and so the two empires remained bitter neighbors. Queue \"Hurt\" by Johnny Cash. I actually felt really emotional, so much so that I put the game down for months, and even still I have trouble playing it for more than a few hours a week.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5h61bh/adeptus_evangelion_the_curious_case_file_of_aiden/",
        "text": "Each of these Case Files always begins with a little assumption about gamers writ large. I guess you learn a fair bit about gaming tropes and etiquette during utter sprawl games. So here's another assumption of mine, more aimed at GMs: no matter how much you prepare for your players, there's always one guy who completely throws off your expectations. Irritatingly, that guy in cases like this can totally derail a campaign.\n\nAs a summary for anyone who hasn't read the previous Case Files, this is my best attempt to recount a trainwreck of an Adeptus Evangelion game that I took part in. It was a somewhat sordid affair, with only one other player half the time due to problems with planning and interest. In the previous tales, my character Aiden Tanner entered NERV as an Evangelion pilot and within the span of a few sessions had lost her first battle, developed her first crush, and committed her first unintentional murder. During those write-ups, I referred to the other guy, very obliquely, as Speedwagon. He had another character in the campaign, but honestly I don't think there exists a better pseudonym for the guy at this stage. While I haven't been giving him much attention, Speedwagon wound up contributing a fair bit to the campaign. See, this particular session is pretty much Speedwagon's story.\n\nNow, in between the last session and this one we had a little side session to try out the “Unsung Heroes” portion of Adeptus Evangelion. Put simply, Unsung Heroes is a side project in Adeptus Evangelion used for the purposes of taking a break from animu shenanigans and Angel fights and doing some more down-to-earth action. The GM had set it up so that we would get a taste of how NERV operated when it wasn't sending unstable teenagers out to fight physics-wrecking aliens. The plan was to try and cast some light on PROJECT JAGUAR, the looming problem that NERV didn't fully understand. Naturally, the plan didn't work.\n\nI'm going to skip that session. I can't wring any humor out of that session. It was a session full of petty bickering, poorly-thought-out plans and dumbass macho posturing. It ended with every one of our “unsung heroes” gunned down by each other's hands and the evidence of the entire affair incinerated. It was only by the posturing and guile of Speedwagon that we wound up knowing anything about PROJECT JAGUAR before the hammer came down.\n\nPreamble over, today's session began with Aiden being released from the brig after a day or so. She returned home confused and guilty, unsure as to why exactly she had been effectively slapped on the wrist for full-blown manslaughter. Aiden's presence in this session was muted. I didn't want to be an attention-hog. That being said, Speedwagon more than made up for it. His nature as a party animal and a druggie was turned up in this game, leading to a fair share of shenanigans. The stand-out low moment occurred when Speedwagon came across one of NERV's many bizarre clone pilots at a late hour of the night, and when she began questioning the nature of mankind's existence he promptly offered her a beer and got her drunk in short succession.\n\nSpeedy also got on the good side of R, the NERV agent who cooked the evidence of PROJECT JAGUAR. Honestly I can't remember how this happened, as the only thing I can remember about R that I can remember aside from him being a truly horrific driver is that he was a reserved individual. Somehow, Speedwagon got this guy to spill his guts about what exactly the PROJECT was. More on that later, because honestly the fact that Speedwagon somehow had his hands on classified information was enough to set the events of today's idiot tale in motion.\n\nA talk with R somehow lead with a talk to the Vice-Commander of Alegria base. The GM later told me it was so that the GM could put his daughter under Speedwagon's care. Funny how something so simple can start a shit-storm, isn't it? Of course, Speedwagon being a dolt he immediately blabbed to the Vice-Commander about the classified information that R had just disclosed to him. The Vice naturally wants to know how he's breached NERV security, and naturally Speedy tells the guy all about R. Speedwagon is then shocked when the Vice requests for this man to be brought in and killed. As in, the player himself was taken off-guard by this sudden swerve.\n\nNot wanting to murder a good friend over his own incompetence, Speedwagon's first impulse was to get to R and get his take on the matter. He spent a bit of time tracking down R and told him about the fuck-up. R's slightly pissed at Speedwagon potentially turning him into an “unfortunate accident,” but since he's an intelligence agent he's got a plan in place. See, earlier when Speedy was talking to the Vice the guy made an absolutely charming remark about how “all Asians look the same to him.” R decided he could capitalize that and send in a body double. He tells Speedwagon to bring the double to the Vice and kill him as requested, because the Vice seemed to trust Speedwagon to actually follow orders. Then R will just continue working as normal, because it's not like the Vice'll ever know.\n\nLong story short, Speedwagon returns to the Vice with the double and a loaded pistol. The Vice asks for confirmation that this is indeed the Asian guy he wanted dead, but when Speedwagon gives him token reassurance he takes his word for it. The double's clearly scared out of his mind, but he knows what has to be done. Without missing a beat, the Vice tells Speedwagon to shoot the man and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I have no idea why any of us were surprised that Speedy turned his gun on the Vice and shot him.\n\nThe GM was dumbfounded. The player himself didn't appear to fully understand what he'd just done. Without any warning, a firefight had blossomed in the office of a high-ranking NERV official, and what should have been a decent fix that would have allowed the players to continue on as normal had just transformed into a no-win scenario.\n\nThe firefight in question was brief. Suffice it to say, the Vice didn't survive this little skirmish. Speedwagon also got shot to hell, which was just as well because he had about a minute or so before soldiers burst in the door and turned him into chunky salsa. I can't recall if the double made it out of the room alive, but in the grand scheme of things I don't think it mattered. We ended the session there out of sheer audacity. I think the GM was straight-up dumbfounded, since the next session wound up being another Unsung Heroes story so that he could re-think his plans for the next couple sessions.\n\nThus ended Speedwagon and his string of parties. With him gone, our ability to use the Operations Director's combat tricks had vanished. The player made a new character, a pilot this time, and the GM let us know that when we got back to our pilots, we'd be dealing with PROJECT JAGUAR. That session would be the last session of the campaign, and the most tense session I had ever sat in on. Tune in next time, for the breathtaking finale to this curious Case File.",

Also we're level 5\n\nSo the party of 4 got a deck from some cursed item trader; an interesting character based on some backwards Rick Sanchez or something. I immediately draw a card from the deck and get Flames. Meaning an outsider is out to get me. \"Well great.\" I think.\n\nOur Rogue then draws a card and gets Comet. Fairly useless since the next encounter wasn't soloed. I'll get to that.\n\nAnd finally, our Magus... She drew Donjon, derailing the session. Our Oracle refuses to draw any cards.\n\nAfter a nice long drink, we go on a long back and forth quest around the city to find people that can help find our Magus. ***Eventually*** we have 2 wizards working together to summon a devil that apparently is holding our Magus. The room is only 20'/20' and there's 5 of us, + the portal.\n\nPlanar Binding is cast, we attempt some bartering but eventually we settle on selling two of our souls (mine and the rogue's, when we die) in return for the Magus. This happens, but she (the devil) stays. Apparently the wizard fucked up with the spell, and the devil got loose in the house. She immediately murdered the wizard, also summoning a weird fleshy mass that's apparently a devil too.\n\nSo as a magical boy, I summon shit. Our Magus is back, 2 other party members are helping, a wizard is terrified, and there's two devils. All in this 4x4 square room.\n\nAfter a long tough fight, the magus gets amazing crits and destroys the squishy devil thing. Then the real devil summons 4 bearded devils around the room. Plus the zombie of the wizard. It was a clusterfuck but she was low HP. The magus DOUBLE CRITS with her attack and spellstrike, dealing like 12d6 of damage and destroying her. The devils disappear with her magic, and everyone has their souls back. Well, except the dead wizard.\n\nIt was a very interesting session, and we had lots of fun. The temptation of drawing Sun, Moon, Throne, or Gem still makes us keep the deck. But we've agreed only to draw it each levelup, which might be really soon considering the encounter we went through.",

Feel free to ask me any question.  \nAnywho.\n\nCommander Turo stared at the Bar and Brawl. He could not help but feel a bit guilty of what was about to happen. Parcher, Turo's second in command, was having a word with his buddies somewhere behind the commander. What it was about was hardly of any importance at this point, it was too late to turn back, too late to make amends.  \nHis Bloodbrawlers were restless as they waited for the smoke to fill the old tavern. Likely worried that the hundreds of people holed up inside wouldn't surrender. That they'd come out guns blazing and yelling for a revolution. The way things had been lately in the Metalhold one could hardly blame them. The divide between Commander Turo's Bloodbrawlers and the workforce had become too big, and with a leader like Face riling them up there was only one way this could possibly end. Atleast in Turo's eyes.\n\nWith the commander was Parcher, Gritch and 60 mean savages. Some loyal to Parcher and some to Gritch. Most to him, he hoped. Truth be told he was no longer certain that he still commanded the respect he once did. That and the two lieutenants despised eachother and would never stand on the same side of the battlefield if not for Turo.  \nHoled up inside was Face and his \"Dwellers\". Probably about a hundred of them or so. Considering their shite equipment and next to no fighting experience this would be more of a slaughter than a battle. The only issue was Lucky. The man Turo had appointed sheriff mostly out of fear of the man's abilities. \"Hire him and have those guns at your side\" they said. Turo touched the wound on his jaw from the grenade that same man had delivered him. That grenade had sparked all of this. Of course it was on orders from Face, but Turo had never thought they would actually dare to attack him in his own holding of all places.\n\nHe was pulled out of his thoughts as the doors and windows of the Bar and Brawl was knocked down and the Dwellers came running out like the smoked out rats they were. His gaze raced back and forth trying to spot one of the revolts leaders. It soon landed on the walking tank, wearing his usual welding mask and wielding a grenade launcher.

Weapons at the ready, they found themselves traveling down a path towards a frozen lake, with large protrusions sticking out from either side- Andazar, upon closer inspection, recognized them to be massive bones, and it seemed the party was travelling through a massive rib cage of some fallen beast. They stayed quiet and unseen, but the Wyrmling sensed a change in the area. It cried out in Draconic as the party approached, asking who was there. Ardon attempted to deceive the creature by pretending to be the wyrmling's mother, but it was to no avail. The wyrmling knew full well that his mother was dead. Clarine attempted to coax the wyrmling into visible range by speaking soothingly, and through her speech she got the wyrmling to reveal itself. Andazar approached the wyrmling, and through sheer charisma, he managed to keep the wyrmling calm enough that it did not strike out. Ardon attempted to inquire with the dragon on his mother, the Green Dragon, Trinity's Bane. However, this angered the wyrmling. His mother had recently been slain by humans who had been chasing after Trinity's Bane. As the massive green dragon flew to safety, the wyrmling was forced to watch its mother slain. Pleading with the creature in hopes of securing its aid in finding and silencing Trinity's Bane was met with the Dragon opening combat, determined to slay this child of his mother's killer and any of his allies who entered the Wyrmling's territory. He belched forth his icy breath, engulfing the party in cold energy. Shigehara, Starke, and Arion all took massive damage, and Starke fell limp to the ground because the DM didn't realize until after the fact that he had gotten distracted and damaged her twice. Oops. Nonetheless, the DM didn't realize this until it was too late and did not correct himself, continuing the battle. Andazar was the first to respond to the Dragon, and gave a crushing blow using his Strength in Pain ability. The wyrmling used his bite attack on the Tiefling in response. Clarine, however, had begun to face a separate battle from within. As a child she had heard of Dragons as no more than evil beasts, creatures who would slaughter you within moments if given the chance. She had seen the wyrmling intended to hurt her a her friends, she had seen that it was angry and spiteful... but she couldn't help but see I as a frightened child. Using her Invisibility spell she disappeared and hid in the treeline, unable to watch what was happening. Arion struck twice at the creature that had knocked his student unconscious, but he could not cut through the wyrmling's hide. Ardon called out to the creature, and at the same time administered a healing potion to Starke, bringing her back into the battle. Shigehara went to his ally's side and entered his Stone Stance, cutting at the wyrmling twice with his Katana, and striking a critical blow. Andazar struck again at the wyrmling, dealing a hefty amount of damage with his Claymore. The wyrmling saw an opportunity as Starke was still heavily weakened and attempted to charge her, but was set upon by a number of reactionary blows from the party on the way. As he attempted to sink his teeth into the young soldier, Ardon stopped the attack with his shield. Clarine was still nowhere to be seen. Starke went into a full offensive on the wyrmling with her Longsword, first unleashing two blows upon the creature and then overcoming her usual limits to set loose two more blows, dealing a blow to both of the creature's forelegs, a strike to the face, and a final decapitating blow. As the wyrmling fell dead to the earth, a vision set upon Ardon. A black mist emerged from the forest, but the Dragonborn was the only one who could see it. From the mist, the cruel form of Tiamat appeared. She proclaimed that the Wyrmling had been intended to do much more than it had, and its time had not yet come. She willed Ardon's blade out of his grip, and sent it plunging into the body of the Wyrmling. Upon the blade being removed from the body it was wreathed in an aura of cold, and had changed its shape. Tiamat dubbed the sword \"Duskwing\" after the fallen wyrmling, and placed it at Ardon's feet, and disappeared. Immediately Ardon communed with Bahamut about the sword. Bahamut assured Ardon that the wyrmling's death was necessary. It had been born with a hatred towards human beings, and had it survived, it would have caused immeasurable amounts of damage in Oleander. He urged Ardon to use the blade for the good of the country, and to aid in his quest against Trinity's Bane. Clarine revealed herself to the party, and was ashamed by her cowardice. Initially planning to scold her, Andazar decided to reassure the Half-Elf instead. Shigehara in turn assured Andazar that no one else in the party had seen this moment, and the secret that Andazar was fundamentally a good person was kept secure. The party decided to make their way to Titan's Vale to recuperate, and they were met with a disturbance in town. Andazar engaged the crowd that was there, and discovered that Brutus, the leader of the Wolf Clan, sought to lead his clan against Paradise. Andazar decided to challenge Brutus' leadership (Though he did not realize it at the time) and began to fight him one on one. They clashed for a decent amount of time, Brutus unleashing a hail of blows against the Tiefling. Andazar, however, won the day through his incredible strength, keeping the half-breed pinned down and slamming him repeatedly with his powerful fists. Upon defeating Brutus the Wolf Clan kneeled to him and, much to Andazar's chagrin, asked him for his orders. Some social negotiation followed and after some deception and a bit of interruption from Redwood, a Goliath Druid, Andazar told the Wolf Clan that an army had been amassed in Paradise awaiting their arrival, which lead the wolves to an immediate conclusion: they had been sold out.\n*I did not write this.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5gjteg/ikrpg_how_to_break_a_man_in_two_spells_or_why_im/",
        "text": "One of our characters, named Sillith, is playing a homebrewed Bard class, since Iron Kingdoms lacks options in the support role. An interesting feature of Iron Kingdoms is that everyone has at least two classes, so she was also a Thamarite Advocate, which is basically a mechanik-necromancer. I thought it would be cool to give the Bard class a basically-free spell called \"Avert Attention,\" allowing them to target a number of allies equal to their ARC stat, and draw attention away from them. Inspired by Terry Pratchett, it would simply be impossible for people (who fail a difficult willpower check) to notice affected allies, and if they attempted to do so, they would instead have their attention drawn to the caster. Seems reasonable, right?\n\nYesterday, my party finished a dungeon which included an elder ice dragon boss. The party agreed that a big undead dragon was worth hanging around the dungeon for two days, so Sillith killed some of her current thralls and spent all of her rune points on raising it and getting it out of the dungeon. She even rigged it to help her always be casting Avert Attention.\n\nNow I need to introduce Eadwulf. Eadwulf is a perfect asshole, a flat pirate archetype, an NPC who was introduced to drag up one PC's troubled past, help them through a difficult section, drop exposition and die with no love lost. He drinks a lot, and has a low willpower. He's also a little too ambitious for his own good. Most importantly, just before meeting him, they were given advice from a sort of deity figure: \"follow Eadwulf, but don't let him lead.\"\n\nEadwulf joins the party in boarding a merchant vessel to the next town. Sillith finds great joy in hanging a hammock in her dragon's mouth on the top deck and sleeping there. Sailors continually see her suspended there and find themselves uncomfortably unsure how she's suspended there, and unwilling to look around the hammock to see what it's tied to.\n\nThis is all fun and good, until Eadwulf tries to gain control of the ship pretty much by himself, failing miserably. This pissed off the captain, who decided to keelhaul Eadwulf. The party was keen on following Eadwulf, sure, but weren't interested in following him off the front of a ship, so they needed a plan. Sillith had one.\n\nCut to Eadwulf floating in the air above the bow of the ship, as confused as he's ever been. \"Hey!\" says the captain. \"Get down from there!\" \"How is he flying? I didn't think he could use magic,\" says a crew member. \"Why does it look like part of his body is missing?\" says another. \"Why do we all keep looking at Sillith!?\" shouts one angrily. If you hadn't already guessed, the dragon had Eadwulf in its mouth, and had picked him up off the bow so he couldn't be forced over. Amazingly, literally none of the crew passed their willpower checks, including the captain.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" says Sillith's player. \"It's not like they could see through the dragon. It could just surround Eadwulf, and nobody could find him. Why not just do that?\"\n\nAs I start describing this, a player points out, \"wait, are you averting Eadwulf's attention as well? What's it like for him to be surrounded by the dragon?\"\n\nI facepalm harder than I've ever done in my life. \"Umm. He failed the willpower check if you want.\" One of those all-too-common moments of a player looking like a child on christmas receiving a puppy and a DM looking like he's being told he has a week to live transpired pretty much immediately. \"So this guy's surrounded COMPLETELY by the dragon, right? So ANYWHERE he looks, instead of being able to look there, he can think of nothing but me?\" \"That's correct... he's just kind of panicking repeatedly thinking about nothing but that elven bard he recently met, with no idea why it's happening.\" \n\nSomeone says, \"Well, we're still a few weeks from the city, right? We need to feed him.\" I agree that it shouldn't be too hard for them to find food, and Sillith's player cuts in right away. \"Oh my god. Can I give the food to him so all he's able to think about at all is still me?\" Everyone is too entertained to disagree.\n\nSillith climbs atop the dragon. It unfurls its wings so that just the sun is visible through the gap, and Sillith descends from the light to Eadwulf bearing food. Eadwulf is hours into his torment, and when Sillith finally comes down, he screams, \"why is this happening to me?\" SIllith calmly replies, \"because, Eadwulf, I'm your God. You died, and now if you're very good in this place, and think nothing but pure thoughts of me, I'll resurrect you.\" She gives him his food, and leaves.\n\nNow, Iron Kingdoms has a mechanic where you can spend resources to \"boost\" rolls, adding a die. Sillith boosted the deception roll to convince Eadwulf that she was his God, and as always happens when I'm in these situations, the player rolled absurdly well. Eadwulf's faith was absolute.\n\nThis ritual is repeated every day for about three weeks. Each passing day drove his effective willpower lower, and soon it was impossible for him to pass the spell's check, no matter how lucky he was.\n\nFinally, they landed, and needed to steal the ship. Sillith came to Eadwulf. \"Your time is now,\" she said. \"A dragon will materialize, and you will be with me again in the physical world. You will captain this ship wherever I say, and wherever we go you shall spread my word.\" Obviously this broken, ungroomed mess of a man agreed, and was relieved to see a dragon suddenly appear on the ship.\n\nThose crew still onboard at that moment saw a massive undead dragon appear out of *nowhere*. \"Run!\" the party shouts at them, \"we'll hold it off!\" Everyone but the party leaves the ship, and Eadwulf tells them how to sail it away. They make a clean break, and head for the next town.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" says one of the players right before we decide to end the session. \"We're supposed to follow Eadwulf but not let him lead, right?\" \"Right.\" \"Well, now he's obeying every command of Sillith's. It's impossible for him to lead at this point. The prophecy was fulfilled!\"\n\nSo there you have it. Take an insubordinate annoying NPC and make him totally faithful to you, steal an entire ship with precious cargo, and fulfill a prophecy. Not bad for a base class feature and a cost-1 spell with no upkeep cost.\n\n**TL;DR** I give a necromancer/bard a spell that forces people to notice her instead of her undead. She makes an undead dragon, and covers someone's entire field of view with it. The victim goes insane, comes to believe she's his god, and massively benefits the party.",

He has been researching methods to cope and augment his Dark Gifts to achieve his goals.  Priority number one is learning how to easily and repeatedly cast Disguise Self, which has him focused on becoming a Warlock, to gain access to some eldritch invocations.  Because he's been exposed to the power of Jenny Greenteeth, and because he [retroactively] was interested in Faerie tales as a child (I did have him focus on history and lore, so its not *that* far off), he already has his eyes set upon a his Patron, Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness, and of the Unseelie Court.^^1\n\nAnyway, today he died for the first time in a while.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5g8akt/the_tale_of_gristle/",
        "text": "Time to tell the tale of Gristle.\n\nGristle was the main crime boss in the city of Tachd and had been for the last 300 years despite being a halfling (which lasted one third of that tops) and showed no signs of quitting any time soon (because he was secretly a dwarf). The party initially encountered Gristle because one of the PCs was delivering a letter to him on behalf of the sorta queen of NotEgypt.\n\nGristle surrounded himself with the meanest looking halflings and ogres (a symbiotic relationship in my setting) that any of the party had ever seen. Gristle himself was like a shorter, stockier, Lord Tywin, bearing none of the \"baby fat\" common to Halflings (even the mean ones in his employ). He had a desk made from the head of a Rootwalker locked in its perpetual death scream. He said few words, letting the silence make the PCs uncomfortable and try to awkwardly fill it until they were dismissed. When they were, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nUnfortunately events would bring them into conflict with the scary not Halfling.\n\n\nYou see a couple days later the party's aspiring inquisitor found out through a series of events with the party leader/burglar's help that Gristle possessed a lost tome of knowledge about lost gods (one who is the campaign's main threat). Said tome had been swiped from the aspiring inquisitor's boss (an Inquisitor) and said boss was then illegally imprisoned at Gristle's request. So the party went to confront Gristle.\n\nThe party in this session consisted of:\n\n&gt;Da'at, Nimble Human Acrobat Burglar and pseudo team leader.\n\n&gt;Billy Buttery, Strong Human Acrobat Emissary/Soldier and aspiring Inquisitor.\n\n&gt;Gorbad Gorblade (son of Grimwald Gorblade), Orc Gladiator Soldier and frequent instigator of combat because his player gets bored with anything else.\n\n&gt;Noriko, Nimble Human Shaman Sage with her tiger companion Iko (who is currently a baby because of previous events and thus isn't a factor in this story).\n\nThe party enters Gristle's place, an inn called the Laughing Halfling, and request to see him. The bartender (an ogre) tells them to wait and goes to speak to Gristle in the basement. After a wait they get the ok and go downstairs.\n\n\nThe first room in the basement contains 3 enormous wine barrels at the side of the room, a door to Gristle's room, a door to the storage room (where Billy banged a halfling thief earlier while waiting to see Gristle the first time), and the empty table where the mean halflings were earlier but are now absent. The PCs go through to Gristle's room and see the \"halfling\" (none of the PCs ever figured out he was a dwarf since he was the first dwarf encountered after half a year of regular sessions) sitting at his desk. Behind him hung his tapestry depicting an ogre trying in vain to chew a tough piece of meat. To either side of him stood an ogre equipped with a heavy blade for chopping (armour piercing longsword).\n\nThe PCs talk with Gristle who freely admits to having the tome with plans to sell it for a shitload of dosh. Billy says he wants the tome but doesn't have the 2000 silver Gristle wants for it. However, he can get the cash and would Gristle refrain from selling it if Billy gave him a sack of 300 silver (actually contained 500 but Billy had never counted it) as a down payment. Gristle said sure, if he can get the cash inside of a month. Also, no refunds. With that decided the party begins to file out, Gorbad eyeing the ogres, which was the first clue things were about to go awry.\n\n\nBilly and Da'at were the first out the door, and that's when it happened. Noriko had been feeling bad about not helping Gorbad with a slaver ship earlier and felt she owed him one. So once Billy, Da'at, and Noriko were out the door, Noriko shut the door to Gristle's room and barred Billy and Da'at from interfering. Initiative is rolled for all while Da'at's player sighs and Billy's shakes his head.\n\nGorbad draws his new claymore (he lost his original one in the slaver ship explosion) and begins attacking the ogres. The two ogres are joined by two more ogres from behind the tapestry, all of them drawing their blades. Gristle draws his legendary hammer (not actually magic, just rumoured to be) and yells \"Crush him!\" to the ogres using the Captain class' battle plans ability to give himself and his allies +2 damage with lethal attacks. Gorbad's not worried though, he's got lots of armour and lots of health, so battle is joined.\n\nMeanwhile Da'at and Billy have a short but tense conversation with Noriko explaining that they aren't about to attack Gorbad over this and from the sounds in the other room it's much too late for a peaceful resolution. So Noriko opens the door for them and they join the fray, but Noriko hangs back as she doesn't have enough actions to enter the room. This goes poorly for her as one of the wine barrels swings open to reveal the 4 mean halflings from earlier. All of which unload into Norkio with blunderbusses dealing a huge amount of damage to her. The halflings then switch to longswords and the melee in Gristle's throne room swells to confusion.\n\nSomehow Billy manages to disarm Gristle of his hammer, and so the dwarf backs off as his goons slowly fall one after another. When he realizes the jig is up, he flees through the tapestry while his thugs buy him time. Billy and Da'at race after Gristle through the tapestry revealing a long staircase leading down deep under the city above.\n\n\nJust realized I forgot an important part. Da'at is a budding chemist and as such has armed herself with flashbombs. She used one for the first time in this combat and unfortunately it did not go well. She hit all of the foes, but she also hit Gorbad and because Orcs are light sensitive he took 3d6+20 flash damage while the baddies took 3d6. Gorbad was the only one blinded which allowed the ogres to lay a beating on him. He stayed standing but it was a significant portion of his health.\n\nSo Billy is the first to reach the bottom of the stairs and he sees Gristle standing on a pump cart being worked by two ogres. Gristle flips Billy the bird while holding a shortbow. Two more Ogres bar Billy's way with another 4 on a pump cart headed toward him. As Gristle's cart begins to pull away Billy uses Shank (a knife instakill ability against standard characters) on one of the ogres then begins pursuing Gristle's cart. Da'at is the next down and being the insanely sneaky person she is (all the Ghost feats and stupid high Sneak skill) she simply runs past the ogres them never even seeing her as she chases after Billy, Gristle, and the pump cart.\n\nNext down the stairs is Noriko the least combat capable of the group, and she's alone with 6 ogre mercenaries. She manages to kill two with her halberd before being knocked out and begins bleeding out. Luckily Gorbad comes down the stairs and between his claymore, and full Cleave chain he manages to kill all the ogres in one round. However he must now decide to either pursue Gristle or try to save his bleeding comrade despite lacking any medical skills, and Noriko is at -8. Gorbad is her only hope. Noriko also fails her stabilization roll and drops to -9. So he waits for his next turn and then begins his untrained medical check and fails his first one. Luckily Noriko makes her stabilization roll and doesn't bleed out. Seeing that Noriko is ok Gorbad decides to catch up with the others, and looks to the abandoned pump cart...\n\n\nMeanwhile Billy and Da'at are in hot pursuit of Gristle and his pump cart. Seeing this Gristle begins plinking arrows into Billy, whittling away his health. Billy passes his Acrobatics check and manages to leap onto the moving pump cart, then uses his Shove trick to push one of the ogres 5ft back and off the cart. Da'at runs past the ogre who is groggily getting to his feet. The cart continues speeding along as Gristle grabs a pick axe on the cart and crits, burying it in Billy's chest. However his next attack is a nat 1 and so Billy's rib cage disarms Gristle of the pick axe. In response Billy Bull Rushes Gristle shoving him off the rolling cart. The ogre on the cart yells \"BOSS!\" and slams on the brakes. Gristle grabs a 2x4 and begins attacking Billy with it getting help from his Ogre pal. Billy takes a beating but shoves Gristle away so he can kill the Ogre.\n\nDa'at sees this and takes her chance to use her signature weapon on the lone Gristle.\n\nYou see Da'at has a semi-deserved reputation for being a pyro. In an early session she burnt down a nomadic tribe (women and children included) as part of a plan agreed upon by the entire party. They then pinned all the blame for this war crime on Da'at, leading to some PTSD on her part. Later during a desperate battle against a shadow beast, the mage that summoned it, an insane noble, and 3 samurai Da'at once again used fire because blades were having little effect on the Shadow Beast. This lead to Billy's father figure (and the player's first character) dying, which Billy uses to emotionally abuse Da'at. This was going to be another notch in her long sordid history with fire.\n\n\nDa'at threw her fire bomb at the sprawled Gristle and managed to set him ablaze. This only enraged the previously undamaged crime boss. He Frenzies and knocks Billy out on the pump cart with his now flaming pillar of wood. He then moves in to fight Da'at. Which is when the second pump cart slams into him.\n\nFor the last couple rounds Gorbad had been continuously making Athletics checks to build speed on his pump cart. His intention was to joust Gristle using his claymore, however the speeds he reached were far beyond the safety tolerances of the cart, and he ignored the screeching wheels and wild wobbling. He shot past the ogre who had been knocked off earlier and was now jogging towards the entrance and away from the fire in this tunnel under the city. As Gorbad prepared to joust, the pump cart flew off the rails and slammed into Gristle for a fair bit of damage. Gorbad took some himself from the tumble which wouldn't normally be a big deal but he was already in rough shape.\n\nGristle still on fire rose to his feet, shouting in rage and began clubbing Gorbad with his burning plank. A mighty fight ensues as Gristle continues to burn, eventually losing 2 thirds of his health to being on fire. However Gorbad is also taking a beating since he's taking subdual damage from the club, fire damage from the fire on the club, and also the occasional fire damage from being too close to Gristle. Meanwhile fire is spreading through the tunnel, smoke filling its ceiling. Da'at is backstabbing Gristle with her fan blade whenever she gets the chance helping to whittle down the immensely tough dwarven warlord.\n\nAt last there's a break in the fight when Gorbad catches fire, fails his Will save, and begins rolling on the ground to put out the flame. This leaves him sprawled and Gristle bashes him on the head, knocking him out.\n\n\nIt was all up to Da'at at this point. She engaged with Gristle taking nibbles from his dwindling vitality. However the problem with Da'at is that with her extremely high Defense almost any time she is hit it's a critical hit. Gristle gets lucky. He crits Da'at smacking her hard with the his burning club. Luckily for her he finally fails his Will save for being on fire (taking about 18 points of fire damage every round at this point) and stops, drops, and rolls. It takes Gristle 3 rounds to put the fire out (which has now spread to the tunnel's support beams) allowing Da'at to get some stabs into him, eliminating the last of his vitality.\n\nAt this point both of them are exhausted, having a couple levels of fatigue, zero vitality, and some wound damage each. The burning support beam overhead creaks warningly but the two who can hear it are focused only on each other. Desperately clutching his club Gristle yells at Da'at that if she just leaves she can gather her people and she'll never see him again. She takes another stab at him, as at this point it's too late for peace.\n\nThe burning support beam snaps like a twig and falls on Gorbad (unconscious from subdual damage, but with little vitality left) dealing damage. Unfortunately for our orc friend this is the end as he unconsciously burns to death pinned under a support beam.\n\nGristle seeing that peace won't work and with only 2 wounds left stands over Billy's unconscious form and raises his club. \"Stay back, or I'll smash his skull in!\" he shouts at Da'at. She responds by trying to end him. Her luck is nowhere to be found at this time and she rolls a 1. I as GM have no more action dice to activate the error, so Gristle activates it by following through with his threat. He brings his club down on Billy's skull with a coup de grace killing him instantly.\n\n\nHaving seen a childhood friend's skull smashed in by a horse, Da'at knows Billy is dead. So she stabs Gristle ending his life and the fight. She leaves Billy's smashed body, Gorbad's burning body pinned under the support beam, and runs back for the entrance before the entire tunnel collapses. At the stairs she finds the lone remaining ogre standing over Noriko's unconscious form looking unsure of what to do. He sees Da'at and decides that this is pointless. He flees upstairs. Da'at grabs Noriko and slowly carries her upstairs.\n\nShe searches Gristle's desk and finds the tome they were looking for, along with his business ledgers, and a closed letter addressed to \"Sword\" (an unknown figure responsible for the Prince's capture at the start of the campaign). She takes that and Gristle's money box, and goes up to the inn above. The inn is empty and as she comes out she sees that a crowd has gathered to watch the inn which has smoke pouring out of it, but no fire. She grabs the NPC companions left above, and leaves the city.",

        "text": "My name is Isaac Miles. I come from a well off Corellian family, who had fingers in the Empire’s rise. We are a shipbuilding people and the war was dragging on for far too long, and although at the beginning of it our business was booming, because of all the continuous losses, no one could afford to pay for new ships, so we lost customers, we were losing money and the whole shipbuilding business was going downhill. In that situation, any change looks good. And the Empire brought stability. The war ended, separatists were dealt with and suddenly, people needed ships and could afford to pay for them. Commerce resumed and because of our early faith in the new regime, we received our just reward. For a time, anyway.\n\nMy father thought it would be a good idea for me, the youngest of five children, to join the police on Corellia. His reasoning was that with the others becoming lawyers and businessmen, a family member who could help them out in times of trouble would be a sensible idea. I didn’t disagree. \nMy life was good, I had a steady rise through the ranks and made a homicide detective when I was 33, had a great wife, a good life, and a nice supportive family. But then our family friends, the Wayne clan moved against us. They didn’t like our rise to power, they didn’t like the Empire, they preferred the brewing Rebellion, because they supported the Jedi order and as such were forced into the middle class from the near-aristocratic class after the rise of the Emperor. We essentially took their place, but our families grew up together, we thought we could trust them. For fifteen years, we remained close friends, we helped them reclaim some of their status, although not as high as they had before the rise of the empire.\n\nIt happened on the 16th Empire Day. Our family decided to get together to toast to our fortunes, meet up and have a good time. I was running late that night, because of a case I wanted to wrap up so I could focus on new ones the following day.\nI was about two hundred meters from the family mansion in the country side when I heard a barrage of blaster shots. I sprinted to the door, saw a man leaving through one of the windows and I immediately ran to it. I saw a shape in the garden running away quickly. I pulled out my pistol and took a few shots before he disappeared to darkness. I called for backup, but we weren’t able to find him.I tried to pull myself together long enough to find out who carried out the assassination and we found some blood in the garden and a DH-17 blaster next to it. Seems I shot the bastard in his gun carrying arm. The blood identified the murderer as Rollo Tomassi, who had a record as a hitman for one of the Hutt Cartels.\n\nUsing blood tracing technology, able to sniff out any traces of blood, we tracked the assassin down to a mansion owned by the Wayne family. It appeared he left the house afterwards, went to the space port and disappeared without a trace. By that point, I was already boiling with rage. I made sure I used the leverage I had on my partner not to tell anyone, instead saying the assassin went directly to the spaceport, without stopping at the Wayne house.\nAfter their fall following our rise, there was only one son left. The other one committed suicide and the parents died of heart break soon after. Jon did well enough for himself, he was able to afford maintain the manor, a pretty wife and to give the two children he already had before the Empire a good education.\n\nNone of that was going to invoke mercy from me. I stopped in front of the house, it was a late evening and only one light was lit in the house. I knocked on the door, like every polite person should. Jon himself opened the door. I hit him straight in the solar plexus. He doubled over, I kneed him in the teeth, resulting in him landing on the floor dazed and half unconscious. I knew their house, as I was a guest there couple of times, when I thought we were still friends, so I dragged Jon to the kitchen and tied him to a chair. At that point, his wife came into the room.\n“What’s going on here?” she said sleepily.\n“Where are your sons?” I said, pointing my gun at her.\nShe immediately grasped what was going on and started shaking. “They’re both upstairs from university for the Empire Day celebrations.” \n“Thank you” I replied, set my gun to stun, shot her and tied her to another chair.\nAfter that, I went upstairs, stunned both the sons before they even woke up, and tied them up downstairs, next to their parents and waited for Jon to wake up.\n“Why did you do it?” I asked calmly.\n“Do what?” said Jon.\n“Okay, that was your freebie. From now on, when you play stupid or lie, I will hurt your family. So again, why did you do it?”\n“I really have no idea what you’re talking about Isaac!”\nBOOM, roared the heavy blaster pistol in my hand as I shot Jon Jr in the knee. “Try again” I said as the young man cried out in pain through the cloth in his mouth.\n“Okay, okay, you fucking sadist! We did it to get back what is rightfully ours and you helped take away from us.”\n“We?”\n“Yea, we as a fam-“\nBoom! Wyatt, the younger son, suddenly had a hole in his arm. \n“You are way too poor and stupid to do this on your own Jon. Who helped you?”\n“The Rebel Alliance. They wanted someone sympathetic to their cause in a high position instead of you. And because of your friendship, the Empire started to trust us again, we were the natural successors if suddenly the whole Miles clan ceased to exist.”\n“I’m glad you are cooperating so far. One last question. Why the Hutts?”\n“I won’t tell you anything more unless you promise you will let my wife and children live. Do with me as you wish, but let them go.”\n“You have my word. Why the Hutts?”\n“No one else besides the Empire has assassins ready at the drop of a hat at any major planet in the galaxy. With the Rebel senators supporting me financially, I was able to afford their prices. Their assassins carry out their tasks efficiently and usually flawlessly. We didn’t count on you working late on Empire Day.”\n“Very well.” I said and shot both his sons in the chest. They slumped in their seats, eyes wide open, yet lifeless.\n“What the fuck?!” Jon screamed. “You said you’d let them live!”\nBoom! Jayanna, the spouse, had her head thrown back as the blaster bolt impacted, knocking the chair over. Jon was reduced to only quite whimpers now. \n“And you said you were our friend.” I said, before planting three shots in his chest and leaving the house. \n\nThe next day, I handed in my badge. No one knew the Waynes had anything to do with the murder of my family. Two respected families were wiped out in one evening, for all everyone cared they got hit by the same organisation. And no one wondered why I handed in my badge, after all, my whole family died, some time off was obviously needed.\nI spent the next two years trying to get closer to the hitman, but he eluded my grasp. Finally, after a long search I found a gang that was able to resist the Hutts. One that wasn’t in bed with the Rebels. They operated from the planet Hapes and were led by a nameless Trandoshan. I did a small spying job for a rich lady who thought her husband was cheating on her, so I had enough money to buy a ticket and not to dip into my family savings, because they were undoubtedly watched by either the Rebels or the Hutts, neither of which may know what I looked like, but they knew I was trying to hunt them down.\n\nI spent a few days on Hapes initially feeling out where a gang might have its headquarters. Turns out it was in a warehouse on the outskirts of the capital city, with a lot of civilian foot traffic. The only thing that gave it away were the brawny folk with badly hidden guns under their jackets and coats.\nI approached the main entrance and was stopped by a brawny Twi’lek. After a quick chat, during which I told him why I’m there, I got to meet the boss, a Trandoshan with no name, only referred to as “The Trandoshan”.\n“Why are you here? Who are you? You’re not one of the regulars, nor do you work for me”, he said, without the typical Trandoshan elongated S’s.\n“I am here to join your gang, I want to shoot the Hutts.” I replied and proceeded to tell him my story. He was very sympathetic and after a search for my name in Corellian records, confirming that I am indeed a disgraced police force detective wanted for four grisly murders, offered me a job as a muscle on one of his ships, a YT 1300 freighter, called Century Hawk.\n“We lost a Chiss bounty hunter on the ship previously, he underestimated a Rebel general, attacked his ship and was impaled on a lightsabre pike by said general. We’re only lucky the rest of the crew got away. They could use an extra crew member, they’ve got mundane repairs before them for now, but that should give you an opportunity to get to know them and earn their trust.”\n“I’ll take it,” I said and was promptly pointed to the ship in question.\n\nI quickly introduced myself to the crew, a corellian pilot by the name of Klin and a twi’lek medic called Selena. There was also a Togruta with a robotic hand, but he was in coma. Apparently, he goes by the name of Tyloth, but I heard the rest of the crew call him simply “The Receptionist”, though I have no idea why they did that. We seemed to get on well enough, except some racism thrown the Twi’lek’s way by Klin, who seemed to have hard time believing that Twi’leks are good for anything except dancers and slaves.\n\nWe set off through hyperspace towards Nar Shaddaa. Above it, in the orbit was a space station that carried out repairs for The Trandoshan and his gang. Right under the Hutts’ noses, was a space station vital to the gang they were trying to push out in order to expand their sphere of influence. \nThe journey was supposed to take us four days, because our pilot set the course badly. So we set in and Selena showed me the ship. Once we got to the engine room, we found a pistol. No one knew where it came from, it belonged to no one on the ship. A spy maybe? We asked the pilot to lock himself in the cockpit, so no one could get to him. Fortunately, we had time, because of the astrogation mistake, so we didn’t have to split up and allow ourselves to be picked off one by one. \n\nWith about half of the ship searched through, cargo bay was the next area on the list. As soon as we opened the door to it, we heard a strange humming, emanating from one of the boxes they kept as loot. Selena took a few steps forward, but collapsed, out of reach. I called the pilot over and went in myself, collapsing almost instantly after crossing the threshold. Fortunately, Klin was able to pull me out of there and soon after, we were able to retrieve the Twi’lek. \nDeciding there was no way of stopping the humming, after we tried to shoot the box to no avail, we decided to be content with it just being contained to one room, albeit an important one. We set off towards the cockpit, not splitting up due to the strange things happening on the ship. Near the sealed cockpit, I heard rhythmic tapping within the vent system, about six feet behind us. Bringing the others’ attention to this, we decided to raise Selena, the smallest one of us, through the hatch to see what was in there.\n\nAs soon as she stuck her head through there, she saw an alien creature, roughly two thirds the size of a human, with huge claws, teeth and a set of leathery wings. Blaster shots resounded through the vent and the corridor beneath it. The creature was dead. But what was it? Selena was raised all the way to the vents, to examine the creature now lying about 8 feet from her. As soon as she got inside the vents, another one of the creatures ran in from behind her, dragging her around its dead brethren and dragging her towards the cargo bay.\n\nWe immediately pursued the creature through the vents. Although we didn’t get a clear shot, because it was too fast, we heard it move towards the cargo bay. When we got to the vents above the bay, one of them was opened. The humming was audible, but nowhere near as uncomfortable as when we crossed the room threshold earlier. The box it emanated from was right below the hole. Quick look discovered that the creature had Selena on one of the creates, but the angle was too steep to take a shot.\n\nI did the only thing I could think of, I peeked into the room with my legs being held by Klin so I wouldn’t fall in. As soon as I got my head through where the vent grate would be, the humming multiplied manifold, giving me a massive migraine. I however managed to bring myself back from the brink of unconsciousness, took aim and let out a blaster shot, hitting the creature slumped over Selena straight in the head, spraying its brain matter all over the unfortunate Twi’lek.\nSelena was fortunately able to free herself from under the body. Although in the room, she was not paralysed.\n“Selena, we can’t get to you, the humming is way too strong for us to handle, can you get yourself to the door? We’ll unseal it and pull you out.”\n“I’ll try,” she said weakly. \nHowever, because she had the source of the humming, a small box of loot, between her and the doors, she collapsed as soon as she got nearer to it.\nWe weren’t sure what to do, we had no rope to pull her out with, we couldn’t get near her. But then I realised, that the alien creatures not only seemed to be somewhat resistant to the humming, but they didn’t mind going near it, as the cargo bay was their first choice of retreat point, rather than any of the other vacant rooms on the ship. This suggested that they were resistant to it, and often these resistances are stored in the skin of the creatures. I remembered I left a vibro knife in my room, sprinted there and got to work.\n\nSoon after, we dropped the corpse of the creature that died in the vents onto the box. Because I had just finished cutting a box shape in its chest, it fit like a bloody, gory glove right onto the box, and the humming decreased massively. Selena came to, and whilst Klin went into the cockpit to unseal the doors, she helped me push both the dead creatures, including the box, into the airlock. Our reasoning was, that the since it seemed to only cover the room it was in, threshold to threshold, the much smaller room would be more suitable, especially since we had one more airlock on the other side. Also, this would allow us to dump both corpses and the box into space without touching it. \nWe called up the Trandoshan on our intercom and we told him about what happened with the creatures, the humming, and the pistol.\n“Yea, sorry about the corpse leechers, we had a small infestation of them here, seems some got stowed away on your ship. Be careful about them mating, when a male and a female of the species get together, they can produce hundreds of offsprings in a short time.”\n“How do we know the female is pregnant?” we asked.\n“You don’t, you can’t even tell which is male and which is female. The earliest you can tell is when the female explodes into hundreds of smaller corpse leechers that want to murder you.”\n“That’s just great,” I said, “but what about the pistol? Klin tells me it was a modified blaster, similar to what a lot of the rebels use. Any of your soldiers had their guns gone missing?”\n“I can’t help you there, I doubt they’d admit it to me, but I’ll call my two gun techs, they deal with the modified guns, they might know if they modified it and if they did, who was it for.”\nCouple of seconds later, two new voices sounded from the intercom. “Hey, how can we help?”\n“We found a modified blaster, Klin says rebels use it a lot, the chamber is enlarged or something like that, basically it fires more powerful shots. It’s a basic blaster though.”\n“Well, I only deal with high-end blasters, if you’re saying it’s just an ordinary blaster that was modified, I’m afraid I can’t help” said one voice, the older one.\n“I think I remember that particular one… Does it have rebel markings on it?” said the younger voice.\n“Yea, it does, two of them, above the power pack.” Klin said.\n“I modified it for that idiot Tiki, he believed the markings were the thing that made the blast stronger, not my actual work.”\n“Great, can you call Tiki to the comms?”\n“Sure, see you when you guys come back,” said the younger voice and the only thing we could hear for a minute or so was the background noise of a busy gang hideout.\n“Hey guys, the techs told me you wanted to talk to me” said the immediately recognisable voice of the brawny Twi’lek I met just before meeting my current boss.\n“Yes, we did, Tiki, where is your pistol?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Did you lose it?”\n“No!” he said.\n“Then how do you not know where is it?” I said, annoyed.\n“I gave it to my brother, Niki, he said he had some things to take care off and his gun was not good enough, because it didn’t have no markings on it.”\n“Thank you, Tiki, can you put the boss on the phone again?”\n“Sure,” and the comms went quiet for a few seconds.\n“Hey boss, the gun apparently belongs to Tiki, but was taken by Niki. Who the fuck is Niki?”\n“Yea, Klin, remember how I told you and that Chiss guy we had a guy close to the top of the Rebel hierarchy?”\n“Ye?” Klin said.\n“Niki is that guy.”\n“Oh. But what was he doing on our ship?”\n“I have no idea, I didn’t tell him to do that. I’ll have to have a long chat with him. Anything else? I’ve got to get back to business.” \n“Nah boss, thanks, you helped us out a lot,” said Klin and turned off the comms.\n\nAfter a couple of moments, I broke the silence.\n“Didn’t you guys say you had a tangle with the rebels? Where Tyloth got injured and that Chiss guy got impaled?”\n“Yea, we did, so?” said Selena.\n“Well, maybe Niki is playing both sides, maybe he gives information to the Rebels about the Trandoshan’s operations, maybe only the information Trandoshan allows him to know and in return he can spy on the Rebels for the boss and earn trust and higher ranks among the rebels.”\n“That kind of makes sense. But what was he doing on our ship then?” Klin said.\n“Maybe the Rebels wanted to know who’s on the ship that so daringly attacked one of their transports. Maybe he was planting something, but got spooked and left his gun and couldn’t get back for it.”\n“You’re right, we should probably do a full sweep on the ship to find out if Niki hadn’t left anything else behind,” said the pilot.\n\nSo we split up, Klin stayed in the cockpit and did a full sweep of the outside of the ship, whilst Selena and I searched the inside of the ship. After a while, we found nothing, but Klin was more fortunate. There was a beacon right outside our airlock, maybe five feet away from it. We all agreed that we should get rid of it before going to Nar Shaddaa, so we dropped out of hyperspace as soon as we could. \nWe appeared right above Mon Cala, the homeworld of the Mon Calamari and the Quarren. There was a massive imperial presence in the vicinity of the planet.\n“We’ve got to get out of here as soon as we get rid of that beacon,” said Klin, just wording all of our thoughts aloud. “I reckon it’d be easier to remove it on the surface,” he continued and Selena agreed. I didn’t, but since I was outvoted, I conceded.\nWhat followed was a rough landing, so rough one may even call it crash-landing. Fortunately, we hit one of the few uninhabited patches of ground, so our ship did not sink. Only a few minutes after we landed, a Mon Calamarian, with an armed escort, approached our ship.\n“Hello, I am the local customs officer, do you have a permission to land?”\nWe went out to meet him. Klin took charge: “We are sorry sir, we found out we had technical difficulties with the ship, so we had to do an emergency landing in order to fix them. We didn’t have time to get a landing permission, as you can see,” he pointed to the ship, half buried in the ground, “we were going down a mite quickly.” \n“Ah, right, that’s okay, we can give you a day pass, for only 200 credits.”\n“That’s fair enough, as long as we can do some quick repairs,” we agreed. We also agreed that since Klin was the one who crashed, he should pay the fee. He didn’t protest.\n“Pleasure doing business with you, lady and gentlemen, you have one standard galactic day to fix your ship and leave the planet,” the customs officer said and left for a small town not far.\n\nAfter that, we managed to fix the hyperdrive and do all the small necessary repairs that would mean we wouldn’t explode mid-hyperspace. Whilst doing so, we found out the beacon fell off during the atmospheric entry. We did one more full sweep and once we were satisfied with the result, we left the planet. Because of all the imperial ships, we decided against emptying our airlock contents into one of the Mon Calamarian suns, as it might be seen as an act of aggression by the overzealous and overly bored imperial officers. \nSo we plotted our hyperspace course, this time accurately and through an old smugglers’ short cut, that our pilot found on an old map in the cockpit when we were searching for more bugs or beacons.\nWe arrived some time later to Nar Shaddaa, avoiding the planet initially and flying towards the sun. Once close enough, we emptied the airlock and asked Selena to make sure everything flew out. What we didn’t notice until mid-manoeuvre was that the female corpse leecher burst, but not enough air in the airlock caused all the other murdering creatures to suffocate. I guess we were lucky we pushed the corpses in the airlock quickly enough.\n\nWhat surprised us however, was that the box of loot did not fly out, at all, almost as if it was glued to the ground. Fortunately the humming stopped, as Selena confirmed when we sent her in there. In Klin’s words: “Twi’leks are expendable, we can always buy a new one on Nar Shaddaa.” We pushed it back into the cargo bay, and left it there, its soft hum being a little unpleasant, but not painful, like before.\nFinally, we landed on the station in Nar Shaddaa’s meteor belt, successfully avoiding all rocks and Hutt sentries. Once we docked and left our ship, a Rodian by the name of Jeff greeted us.\n“Hello, hello, you must be the crew The Trandoshan sent. You’re late.”\n“Yea, sorry about that, we had corpse leecher and spy trouble. All taken care off though,” Klin said.\n“What do you want me to do with this piece of shit?” Jeff pointed to the Hawk.\n“Repair the engines, including the hyperdrive, and repair the gun turret, it seems the turret was blown off. The door is sealed, but we can’t defend ourselves effectively.”\n“Alright, that’ll cost you though. Well over 1500 credits!”\n“1500?! What for?” Klin said.\n“Turret repair, engine repair, new cannon, armour plating…”\n“We never asked for armour plating!”\n“You’ve got to have armour plating, you guys belong to a gang, who knows, you might get in a space battle soon, you want to survive, right? You don’t want to be cheap and then die, gasping for air, because a shot penetrated your hull and all your air is rushing out.”\n“You’re ripping us off!” Klin said. \n“Okay, okay, how about we make a deal?” I interrupted their argument. “We’ll pay you 300 credits and give you and a box of scrap metal, all good ship metal, just not attached to anything.”\n“How is that a good deal for me?” the Rodian scoffed.\n“You don’t belong to The Trandoshan’s gang, do you?”\n“No, what does that- “\n“So if we tell him that you were very helpful, that you offered us a great deal, that you definitely didn’t rip us off, he might be willing to send more business your way. And for those you can charge as you would normally, but you won’t get that chance, until we can tell the boss just what a great repair shop owner you are.”\n“Hm, okay, but I want three of those boxes. I need metal to make the armour plating from.”\n“Very well, that sounds fair enough, it’s yours, just don’t touch the small box on the side.”\nAnd with that, we returned back to our ship, helping out with the repairs and just waiting for them to be done. Afterwards, we parted our way with Jeff and with our newly rearmed and armoured ship, we set off towards Hapes, this time with no astrogational mistakes.\n\nWhen we arrived at Hapes, I instantly felt uneasy. There was a major commotion, more ships leaving and landing than in the previous month combined. Something was wrong.\nWe landed safely, despite a couple of near misses, and got out of our ship to find the boss waiting.\n“I see your ship’s all repaired. You even got plating on the hull. That couldn’t have been cheap.”\n“Cheaper than you’d think, Jeff gave us a good deal.”\n“I don’t quite believe you, but let’s move on, we’ve got more important things to discuss.” He said, not avoiding the S’s like other Trandoshans trying to blend in.\n“Yea, we saw all the ships, what’s going on?” I said.\n“The Rebel Alliance is coming.”\n“What? We’ve got to get out of here!” I said.\n“They’re here on our invitation, we’re just making sure they don’t see the really bad stuff. What eyes don’t see, doesn’t pain the heart.”\nI took a few breaths to calm down and asked: “Why did you invite them? Any association with them will mean a ruthless hunt and absolute destruction from the empire.”\n“So? We’re criminals, they don’t like us anyway.”\n“Yes, but there’s a difference between not liking that there are rats in your house, but willing to live with it and actively trying to hunt them down and brutally murdering them to make an example to other rats.”\n“We invited them. They need a base of operations somewhere obscure, like Hapes. In exchange, we get a looooot of money from them, so we can finally take on the Hutts. For vacating most of our base here, we’ll still keep a bit just in case, we get a Nebula B Class Escort Frigate. And some more money as well.”\n“But what if they win –“\n“They won’t win, so we might as well get some money from it.”\n“But what if they do. Just theoretically. Then they’ll know all your MOs, and they’ll be able to wipe you out. Whilst now, the Empire may have some general idea, but nothing specific, not how many of your gang is there, what equipment you have, how much money you have.”\n“Too late, we already went into business with them, I am not going to go back on my word! Now you can either accept it, or leave and take on the Hutts yourself.”\n“Fine, but I’ll be working with them under protest and if one of them is hanging out of an airlock, I won’t exactly rush in to help them.”\n“That’s fair enough, I understand that, especially with your history,” The Trandoshan said, “but I need you to get over it. We had some minor unrest about that decision among the population that are sympathetic to the Imperials, so Selena you have to tend to our own wounded, nothing worse than a few scratches, broken bones, and small bleeds. We also need Klin’s help with some of the ships, we’ve got a major operation coming and we need to make sure everything is working well. Isaac, you’re coming with me.”\nWe didn’t protest, and split up. I went with the boss. He led me into a troop transporter, just us and two more soldiers, I recognised them as his trusted lieutenants.\n\nOnce we got moving, he turned to me: “Okay, listen carefully. I couldn’t tell the others, especially with all the other people around. But I asked a few contacts on Corellia and your story holds up. You can be calm about cooperating with the Rebels. Yes, they are using us for a base, and yes, we are getting paid a lot. But I have a special assignment for you. You’re right in saying that they would wipe us out if they could, so that’s why I made arrangements with a Chiss working for the Empire to pass information to them, he was a friend with one of my men. We agreed that he’d arrange for the Empire to turn a blind eye on the outer rim and to our cooperation with the Rebels if we could pass information to them. That’s where you come in. The guy can’t make regular trips far enough out and we can’t get to him securely in the capital. But he may have a few agents about, and since you hate the rebels, I thought you’d be an ideal candidate to give over the information. But don’t tell your crew, they might be Rebel sympathisers. How does that sound to you?”\nExcited by the prospect of doing harm to the Rebels as well as encouraged by the fact I was vastly outgunned and outmuscled in this vehicle, I agreed instantly.\n“Good,” said the boss, “we’re on our way to the first meeting with them now, we’ll find out what’s happening.”\nFor the rest of the trip, nothing but some awkward chit chat with the other two happened.\n\nWhen we arrived there, we were shown into a nicely furnished lobby. The two heavily armed lieutenants were left guarding the transport, I was taken to the lobby and left there, whilst my boss went into the adjacent room to negotiate with the Rebels.\nAn hour or so later, he came out, nodded to me and we went back to our transport.\n“What happened, boss?” I asked, once we all sat down in the vehicle again.\n“We’re going to attack a Hutt mining operation. Once it’s taken, we will seize control of it, keeping all of the profits, but selling metal to the Rebels with a massive discount, not even enough to cover the cost. Not a great deal, but it’ll allow us to get a foothold in Hutt controlled space. And, as a bonus, the rebel spies predict that whilst lightly guarded, the output is enough for it to carry our operations alone, without any of our other activities, even with the discount provided to Rebels. I made sure we’d supply customers on a first come first serve basis.”\n“Sounds good, boss, I’ll tell our crew to get ready for a ground assault.”\n“Yea, do that. Just bear in mind, whilst the mining operation is important, we as a gang are more interested in the ship guarding it. It’s only one capital ship, but it would greatly increase our potential earnings and sphere of influence. Of course the rebels don’t know this, they think the mining operation is our main target. So we will send you, your friends and a sizeable force to seize the mines. If you can’t take them, it’s no great loss, we’ll just bomb it to shit and tell the Rebels some concocted story about that being the last act of the Hutt captain. This is our job, they won’t have any soldiers with us, so they won’t have any way of knowing otherwise.\n\nYour main objective is to make enough noise that you pull enough of the Hutt troops towards you. If you can take the mines, good, if not, just make sure you have enough survivors with you for it to be worth it to extract you under fire, otherwise you’ll be blasted into perdition along with the entire asteroid.”\nNot believing we could fail in taking the mines, because “it’s a small, lightly-guarded operation”, as well as seeing an opportunity to start exacting my revenge on the Hutts, I didn’t think twice: “Understood, boss.”\n\n",

        "text": "Last time I wrote, I made the assertion that every player has at least one trainwreck game. How, when, and why always changes, but at least one game will wind up being the perfect combination of frustrating, depressing, and awesome. Well, as a bit of a corollary to that assertion, I would assert that every player has a moment where one of their characters undergoes a drastic change from what they were originally intended to be. \n\nIn recap, I got one of my friends to run Adeptus Evangelion, and the first session had ended with half the PCs hospitalized and the mission to protect the Norfolk Islands a failure. Only two characters got to go straight home to lick their wounds: Operations Director Speedwagon, and Sixth Child Aiden Tanner. The former had struck out with his superior and had a career on thin ice, and the latter was more preoccupied in contacting her mother than meditating on the countless deaths that she and her team had just failed to prevent. Good start.\n\nFast-forward to the second session, when the rest of the PCs get to arrive in Speedwagon's “apartment” for the first social session. Now, this is part of the reason the game was kind of a trainwreck. Adeptus Evangelion is one of the few RPGs I think I've ever seen that encourages the GM to set aside sessions for purely roleplaying reasons. Depending on the length of the campaign, you could have as many as two of these mech-less sessions between angel scraps. In theory, these sessions would give the pilot characters a chance to unwind, let down the barriers of personality and get to know their fellow men.\n\nExcept it didn't.\n\nI mentioned earlier that there were only three people that made it to each game. The GM, Speedwagon, and myself. There were two other PC pilots, but due to a killer combination of scheduling reasons or lack of interest they were infrequently present and barely engaged. Their PCs were a fighter broad named Sarah and a Manufactured named Sinbastian (insert compulsory “edge” joke here). In social sessions, neither had any reason to engage with Aiden or Speedwagon outside of “oh, I guess my character does this.” It didn't help that neither were played as approachable human beings in the first place.\n\nSpeedwagon was also impossible to talk to, but for different reasons. Reasons relating to the “apartment.” See, we had a three-storey building to ourselves. A three-storey building that Speedwagon used for frequent, raunchy, thankfully off-screen parties. While minors were present. The GM described the floor as being wall-to-wall garbage, discarded pizza boxes and Chinese food and BROKEN GODDAM GLASS. Speedwagon took no initiative in cleaning this up. When pressed, he said that “he'd called in a buddy of his to be a cleaner,” and left it at that. That buddy never materialized. The pilots would apparently subsist on a diet of take-out because the fridge was a biohazard, and a brief sprawl on the couch put an irremovable, unidentifiable stain on Aiden's favorite hoodie.\n\nWell, Aiden couldn't really deal with this house. She couldn't really deal with Speedwagon and his weird, perverse party crap, and she couldn't deal with her distant, uncaring fellow pilots. So she left.\n\nTo make a really long story short, Aiden spent a session walking around Alegria by her lonesome. The most significant things she did in this time period were A) stealing Speedwagon's phone to make a call to her mother, which bore no fruit, and B) make enemies with a NPC I would later learn was the daughter of the vice commander. I tried to play Aiden as a relatively responsible young adult throughout this point, aside from the occasional moments of teenage snottiness that lead to the above two moments.\n\nThe next session was another combat session. An Angel had gotten wise, and was burrowing its way into the Geofront. Ever-prepared, NERV just happened to have two suits of harsh-terrain armour to plonk onto two Evas. Yes, two. Neither of the other players had been able to show up, so Aiden was going to be assisted by an NPC. In this case, an NPC that was being escorted into the base by the base commander, who he addressed as his mother.\n\nEnter Huey, the Manufactured (read: clone) pilot of Unit-00. Huey was, hands down, one of the best things to come out of this game. He was a nervous, naive individual with a head full of trivia, who was mumbling to himself about he mustn't be afraid as the Evas were descending into the caverns underneath NERV base. Aiden took a liking to this character almost instantly, as he was one of the few people she could actually talk to. They bantered a bit during the set-up, with Aiden eventually promising Huey that she had his back. At which point the GM slapped down the map and told us what we were dealing with.\n\nThe new angel, hereafter named Uriel, was a strange spider-like creature that emitted a steady flow of oil across its skin. Because we were under the base, our power came from an experimental N2 reactor that our mechs had to carry in order to move. The Evas umbilicals were something like 50-100m in length, so we couldn't get too far from the reactor. If we ran out of time, it would explode so that the Angel didn't get in. Yes, NERV were still delightful folks.\n\nThe Uriel fight went much more smoothly than the previous one had. Aiden tanked the bulk of the Angel's attacks while Huey did his schtick, and Speedwagon proved himself useful by performing his duties as an Operations Director to give bonuses to the pilots. Aiden ultimately ran out of power again after her umbilical was severed and she was knocked out, but their team effort payed off and Huey managed to take down Uriel. Score one for humanity!\n\nAnd then, like most crappy anime that try to be like Evangelion, a sudden and horrifying shift took place in the very next session.\n\nEven though Aiden technically spent the last bit of the fight in La-La Land, she was thrilled to have finally made a friend. So happy was she that she cheerfully skipped out of the infirmary and down the hall, ready to navigate the confusing mess that was the NERV military complex and head home. Unfortunately, she was helplessly lost. A fortuitous left turn later, and she was walking past a conference hall when she heard Speedwagon arguing with another member of the base staff. She decided to do the worst thing you could possibly do in this scenario: sneak up to the doorway and listen in.\n\nSee, while the Uriel fight had gone exceptionally, the staff of NERV had come across a worrying trend. A string of comics called “JET JAGUAR” had popped up across Alegria, which coincidentally was a UN project centred around making the Evangelion Project obsolete. NERV didn't have info on this, but they were scared shitless at the mere prospect that they could be replaced.\n\nAnd Aiden was just hovering at the door, soaking in all this confidential information.\n\nSpeedwagon's player and I rolled off, my stealth versus his awareness. Three guesses who won. So as the meeting draws to a close, Speedwagon stands up and walks outside, where Aiden is trying to unsuccessfully walk away as if nothing ever happened.\n\nSpeedwagon demands to know what she heard. Aiden denies hearing anything and quickens her pace. Speedwagon calls out for her to stop. Aiden runs. As she runs, Speedwagon calls out for base personnel to stop her. He fails his fellowship role, and the guard who runs out is just confused by the fleeing teenager. He asks what's going on.\n\nAiden's response? “Pull the fire alarm, pull the fire alarm!” And my roll was exceptional.\n\nThe base descends into chaos as the fire alarm goes off. Soldiers are running around, civilians are evacuating, Aiden has turned into a rat in a maze. I was laughing like a hyena out of the game, because holy shit I didn't think that actually would have worked. My humor faded somewhat when I got cornered by a group of marines. During a brief tussle, Aiden managed to steal away one of their guns. Naturally, the minute she has a gun, the marines bark at her to PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON AND GET DOWN ON THE GROUND! Rat, trapped. So a frustrated, tired Aiden heard that order, and threw away that gun as hard as she could. Predictably, a loaded firearm doesn't respond well to be lobbed. It goes off, and the ensuing ricochet puts a bullet into one of the marines' stomachs.\n\nAiden has just accidentally killed someone.\n\nThe session ends with Aiden being bundled into the brig, miserable and horrified at her own actions. She got a brief talk with Speedwagon, and then the GM doled out experience. I felt slightly hollow inside at that point, and to this day I'm still not entirely sure why I did it. In retrospect though, accidental murder would become something of a theme over the remaining sessions.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5fzp0p/don_quixote_the_cheater/",
        "text": "I've written up and posted some of my gaming stories in various places - I guess I'll throw them up here on reddit too. Lets start with a tale I've posted once before in comments on reddit: Don Quixote, the cheater.\n\nI used to game with a guy I like to refer to as Don Quixote. I call him this because he would not play unless his character was a shining white knight Hero - capital intended. This guy was straight out of Cervantes - he read his adventure novels and now he wanted to be in them. He was incapable of playing a character who didn't fulfill the following criteria.\n\n* knows everything.\n* does everything well\n* upstanding white knight characterization\n* always right\n* party leader/face\n* has an NPC waifu to latch onto (this could arise during the course of the game)\n\nNone of this needed to be reflected in his stats or on-paper abilities, but that's how he would play his character regardless. Dumpstat is Charisma/Fellowship? He's still the party face. His waifu is actually an NPC considerably higher leveled and more powerful than us? Doesn't matter, his waifu is in danger, we must rescue her even though we pose zero threat to the dangers she faces. Morally ambiguous power that may turn you evil? He uses it, because he could never be evil.\n\nNow, obviously, short of being given special consideration by the DM to outright make him better than the other players (which he did not get), the only way to accomplish this is to cheat. And cheat outrageously.\n\nWhen I first encountered Don, he was playing an Adept in Dark Heresy - for those not familiar with it, it's a squishy scholar class whose function is to know everything so that they can solve mysteries and point the people with actual facebeating skills in the right direction. And he was upset that his scholar was being *vastly* outdamaged by the extremely min-maxed psyker and the hulking brute of an Arbites. So all of a sudden despite his middling ballistic skill of 30, he never missed a shot.\n\nDice would be rolled, snatched up, and a success declared. If the DM reminded him of penalties, he would suddenly 'remember' a bonus he had forgot to add. This extended into being the party face, despite not being particularly personable, or even wise. This continued throughout that campaign, and while there was a glorious moment of comeuppance at the finale for him, that story isn't about his cheating.\n\nInstead I'm going to talk about the short stint I did in a fantasy campaign beside him. He's now familiar with my usual group, but I had been drifting away due to my work hours, moving in with my fiancee, and the fact that I had moved some distance away from my usual DM's place. One of the players in this new campaign invited me along, since he wasn't sure he could take anymore of Quixote's shenanigans, especially since the sequel campaign to the initial Dark Heresy campaign had finished, and had resulted in Don dooming the entire galaxy due to his actions.\n\nI reluctantly joined, knowing that it'll be a bear for me considering my schedule and now I'm committed to dealing with Mr. Quixote. This is a 3.5 based Iron Kingdoms-esque homebrew with gun technology hovering around 1870, but some medieval kingdoms managing to hang on via magic. I make a pretty interesting druid that I would love to reuse again sometime, because he got his story cut short. Mr. Quixote is playing a Paladin - capital intended.\n\nHis usual shenanigans continue - trying to take over the party, pretending that his motivations are the motivations of the whole party, that hes a shining beacon of moral fiber that can do no wrong. There's an amusing moment where Don absolutely fails in his negotiations with a scholar, not understanding that any attempt to convince the centuries-long pacifist scholar to join the war is going to fail. Then compounding this mistake by telling him that they're going to save all the primitive savages by taking them away and civilizing them, then bringing them back to fight this army... to the pacifist anthropologist there to study their unique culture. That was a realtime 30 minutes wasted as Don could not grasp why this line of argumentation would be wrong.\n\nEventually though, we end up in a fight in the jungle, where an enemy commander is riding on the back of a dragon. Don leaps onto the enemy dragon and does a positively ridiculous amount of damage for the level we were at - I think we were somewhere between L6 and L8 and Don did something like 70~ish damage between the 6 d6's he rolled, his static bonus and his bastard sword. I quietly 'wat' to myself and let the first round slide. It must be some kind of charge attack bonus thing.\n\nRound two happens and he rolls the same dice (because of course he hit) and doesn't roll as well but still gets over 50 damage. Now I ask him.\n\n\"Hey, how are you doing all that damage, Don?\"\n\n\"Oh, combination of Leap Attack and &lt;other feat which escapes my mind at the moment&gt;.\"\n\nNow Don isn't aware, but I have a nice reference document on my phone which lists all the feats in 3.5. I look up both feats. Leap attack doubles your Power Attack bonus, Triples if using a two handed weapon, but only after a making a 10+ foot leap. So there's no way that he could use it in the second round. Feat 2 was +2d6 damage if condition X was met.\n\nRound 3 rolls around and as he rolls his damage dice I ask him when he leapt.\n\n\"What?\" he replies.\n\n\"Where'd you leap to, since you're using that damage boost. Leap Attack requires you to leap. Also, why're you rolling 6d6? &lt;other feat&gt; only gives you 2d6.\"\n\nDon babbled something about having misread it, and the Pathfinder version being different, then rerolled his damage to be a more sedate 20, and was much subdued for the rest of the session.\n\nI wish I could say that we then talked to Don about his cheating, but nothing was said when the session ended, and I'm not sure how it ended up after that, since I wasn't able to make the next few game sessions and dropped out of the campaign entirely - I haven't seen my old DM in a while now, and when I do see him pop online, asking how Don is doing is usually the last thing on my mind.\n ",

        "text": "tl;dr we played through RE5 in one sitting, and ingame time kept pace with real time.\n\nI had just gotten Resident Evil 5 in the bargin bin of my local game store, specifically because it had couch co-op. I invite my friend over for a weekend of fun, enjoying one of our last summers before the glory days of high school end.\n\nThe game starts off simple enough, building the atmosphere with a slow and scary pace. The story starts in the afternoon with frightengly difficult zombies and tight corridors, fighting to keep Competent Elevator Man alive, getting beseiged in that house, fighting off zombie bikers, and as the sun goes down we approach that fuckin' oil factory and blow it up, racing off that fuckin' dock we kept getting stuck on as the sunset sets behind us and we fight annoying prick crocodile man on a moving boat, Eventually there's the humvee and the giant crocodile hulk in the middle of the night, like 3am or so. Then Seargant Elevator Man takes us through that moving boat level where we're ducking under things and shooting gates open, and he says he'll bring the boat around and everyone knows he's destined for certain doom, but then we're in a cave with tiny spiders, that weird two-person flashlight, and the cave opens up into a giant Mayan temple?? So we fight against the laser monsters and the laser puzzles and whoops, we reach the surface and it's bright day for some reason, and we look out the window and holy shit it's like 11AM and it's really bright out.\n\nso then there's uh, more outdoor walking, and the airboat part, where we're steering around the map going to like 4 camps to forge a door key, and there's that one bit where we had to cross under a hut in an enclosed arena full of crocodiles that'd one-shot you... and then once we opened that door there was just generic natives villages, oh and that bit where there's the platform that's moving across a rope floating in crocodile infested waters, with the QTE to not get gobbled the fuck dead.\n\nAfter that's a camp with a snake that bites you, and then secret underground techbase, The Password Is Kill A Giant Spider, then CLONES and more TECHNOLOGY, that one hallway where the lickers just flood out of their cages and chase you down the cramped scary hall, and then there's a DIG SITE for some reason but it's NOT the temple and now the zombies HAVE GUNS and this survival game is now Gears of War, we're fighting across conveyor belts in a crematorium, then we're in a room where there are TWO GATLING GUN ZOMBIES and then we're outside and it's nighttime again, and guess what it's like 9pm.\n\nSomewhere in here is that fight where Keanu Weebs is chasing us WHILE \"the old partner that literally chris cannot go five lines without mentioning\" is also doing matrix flips and shooting us, and the boss fight is running from them until wesker literally gets bored and leaves, and then one of us grabbing the partner and the other beating the everloving shit out of their face until technology breaks.\n\nWe get onto a cargo ship with zombies and crane puzzles and we get split up because switches, and there's the one part where I was stuck in a cage because Evil Crane Zombie and you had to fight off waves of bullshit and shoot a switch to free me after all the action finished, we were stuck there a while, then we get up to the command tower and Giant Tentacle Beast that's also The Hot Villain Chick Who Also Terrorized Us With The Flamethrower Zombie Back In The Base but all mutated because plot, with QUICK TIME EVENTS and ORBITAL SATELLITE CANNON.\n\nNow we're in Arsenal Gear getting shot at by zombies again, and we're doing the timed bit with the giant bulkhead doors and yakkedy saxxing around some tough guys while the whole base explodes, catwalks fall and we keep hitting switches to open doors to more of the Terminator Scyther beasts that you literally have to Dead Space to get 'em to not instakill you. We kill everything, open the final bulkhead, and holy fuck it's two gatling gun guys on top of scaffolding pillars. So it's yakkedy saxxing all the way back through the maze of pipes and catwalks we'd just cleared, running until we'd gotten JUST enough distance that the other could get a clean shot on one. We were stuck here a lot, too.\n\nSo we get up on deck of Arsenal Gear and Wesker Reeves is doing kung fu shit, dodging bullets and we're shooting rockets at him that he catches and we blow up in his face, and one of us manages to pull off a sick 6 stage QTE to punch the glasses right off his fucking face. But then he still gets on his stealth bomber that gets catapulted off the deck, off to go drop the zombie apocalypse on as big of a city as he can, and we're also inside and there's that really annoying quicktime event where we're shooting him as he's jazz-dancing his way up a tumbling plane. We kick him into a fucking volcano but also crash there, and there's the part where you're mashing buttons to fucking punch giant boulders into gravel, and I'm mashing buttons to not fall off a ledge, and we're inches away from the lava below but it doesn't matter because you're punching giant fucking boulders and I'm just too lazy to pull myself up, and then Weebster goes full japanimated with his zombie tentacles, we have to shoot him a lot in the heart or the face or something and that was a good boss fight. \n\nJust as the credits start to roll, the happy music plays, the helicopter starts to cruise away from the volcano, messturd jumps out of the lava, still on fire, and lashes out the kilometer or so at the helicopter. With one last triumphant quicktime smash, we fuckin' put two RPGs into his eye sockets and blast him into inevitable sequel land. The music returns, the helicopter sails off into the sunrise just as our side window bathes the room in sunlight again. And plot twist, the pilot is none other than Sgt. Elevator Destined For Doom himself.\n\nThat was the most surreal gaming experience I've ever had, not only playing that game in one sitting, but the game's time matching our own the whole way through.",

The Elves, Gnomes, Kor, Goliaths and Aarakocra who had fought alongside us were given a hero's welcome. A banquet was thrown in our honor. It was while I was feasting on a succulent peryton wing that a commotion broke out in a nearby hut. Flamer went to investigate, and after a few moments of silence called us over.\nDella was on her knees by the unconscious body of Tiseo, shaking in her armor. She explained that he had demanded that she give him the Forever Stone, which of course she did not have. When she had refused, he had grown desperately angry. Before she could hurriedly excuse herself, a horrific change had come over him. His eyes had combusted into charcoal, his fine golden hair had burned away as flames erupted from every pore. He grew twice his size, and his features contorted until he was unrecognizable. He had screamed in agony, swayed for a moment, then collapsed and reverted to his normal form.\n\nWe took him into custody and Korena questioned him. I swear, she can tell if someone is lying by the very look in their very eyes. What she learned shocked us all to the core.\n\nTiseo had been behind it all. A few years ago, he had discovered a prophecy leading him to believe that Tiamat would enter the world and destroy all of creation except those who helped her the most. He became obsessed with surviving the supposed oncoming apocalypse, even manipulating Della into gathering a team together to retrieve the Forever Stone. He started the dragon cult, steadily growing their numbers in secret until it was the time to strike. He sent us on relevant but unimportant missions to keep us out of the way while he prepared to bring Tiamat into the world. He had planned the demise of every living being except himself.\n\nHe didn't know what had happened to him after he had asked Della for the stone. He said it felt like his body wasn't his own any more, like he was being possessed. Della seemed to think that was likely, and I agreed. A creature so evil, so cold and emotionless, would be a prime target for demonic possession.\n\nOur festivities were dulled by this disturbing revelation. Tiseo was locked away in a dungeon among the ruins of Orthraze, his sightless eyes staring and charred lips cursing at us as we left.\n\nWhat truly troubled us was his utter refusal of Nurvureem's part in his scheme. He had remained adamant that she had been acting of her own accord when she had attacked Orthraze. Of course, he had investigated her motives, but his expeditions into her former throne room only revealed a sign hidden in every shadow around the place.\n\nIt was a sign of an eye. A diamond-shaped, reptilian eye.\n\n* * * \n\nThe peace brought about by the eradication of the dragon cult did not bless Tirkosu for long. Giant walking trees crashed through the jungles, famine plagued the eastern village of Gokapo, and the Goliaths of Tapuk barred all other species from entering the village. We dealt with these issues as best as we could. We had become exceptionally quick to address any situation, as our new flying tower meant that we could traverse the island as speedily as the birds themselves.\n\nOur new acquaintances were readily given the status of Tsethem by the six remaining villages. Up until now, they had been forced to rely upon semi-trained individuals and organizations to protect them from danger. Now they had their own heroes to call Protector.\n\nWith the reveal of Tiseo's true nature, the monastery of Appinamopu was regarded with suspicion and fear. Korena took charge of the lightborn students there, leading them in the rebuilding of Pehkeiai and Paku. Her dedication and honest desire to do right by the people of tirkosu slowly regained the trust of the other villages.\n\nEven though his home was in Paku, Inalak recognized that his innate control over water made him the perfect protector for the merfolk village of Pehkeiai. He aided in the reconstruction of his new domain, his compassion and inner calm bringing peace to the devastated water dwellers.\n\nJaques was given the desert village of Gokapo to protect, but spent most of his down time in Paku with his newly wedded wife, Tikka. She had been named as both Tsethem and chieftess of her village, an honor she was proud to accept. Of all the new additions to our group, they were the ones that enjoyed the floating tower the most. It essentially became their home away from home. Every room had a trinket or personal item of theirs lying around. It added a homely touch to the fantastical experience of living above the clouds.\n\nNaliko, despite being only thirteen years of age, was named protector of Tapuk. I was unsure how she would take this, as she had been all but exiled from the Goliath tribe before she could even walk. Most people would have refused out of anger had they been in her position. But Naliko isn't most people. She explained that her abandonment was a wise move from her parents, and that it made sense to cull the weak of the tribe. Now that she was strong, stronger than the greatest warriors in Tapuk thanks to her experiences, she was happy to be accepted into the fold again. I will never cease to be fascinated by the sight of her small, dark cloaked self standing next to her wolf familiar and giving orders to the tall mountain men who had once branded her as weak.\n\nVindicus... Vindicus simply disappeared. We assumed he was trying to find a new purpose in life. Until Della had given him the Forever Stone, he had most likely assumed he would perish after his vengeance was complete. Now he had years, centuries, millenia to live out. There were rumors that he had been sighted with a group of intoxicated nature worshipers, but they were unconfirmed. He certainly wasn't residing at D'Okai, the Kor village of smoke where he had been hailed as a Tsethem.\n\nThe warforged population had been severely reduced by their spellcaster's betrayal of their own kind. Those that had survived the charge upon the volcano were allowed to return to Karu Sampur in shame, but only because the amount of villagers had dropped to a mere two hundred or so. Flamer determined to find a way to create more of his brethren, even venturing into the ruins of Orthraze to search for blueprints. He asked Lundal for help, but received none; the old rogue was becoming more and more reclusive, still depressed by his encounter with the genie.\n\nIt was a year and six months after our victory against the dragon cult that evil raised its head once more. Flamer was visiting the sick with Naliko in the small settlements around Tapuk. On one such visit they made a shocking discovery: the patient was a dark elf, like the ones that had attacked Orthraze before siding with Imix against Nurvureem. The Goliath woman who owned the small farm explained that he had stumbled into her yurt with a curved dagger in his back. Upon inspecting the blade, Naliko noticed the same symbol of a reptilian eye that had been found in Nurvureem's throne room.\n\nWhen Flamer healed the dark elf enough that he could regain consciousness, he explained in broken elvish that he had come to warn us of an impending attack. He told them that many more of his kind inhabited a city \"down deep\", and that he could show us the way. Naturally, Flamer didn't take him at face value. But upon bringing him to the tower, and getting Korena to question him, we discovered that he was telling the truth.\n\nWhen questioned about his race's part in the fall of Orthraze, he explained that they had been sent to aid the Dark Lady by their god, a being they referred to as the \"Elder Eye\". He communicated via a prophet, similar to how the elemental cultists relayed the wishes of the princes of the apocalypse to their followers. His motives were still uncertain, but it was clear that he detested Tirkosu, and all those who lived on it.\n\nI decided to assemble the team to take down the dark elf army before they could make the first strike. Sadly, my enthusiasm for unity in the face of this new threat was not matched by the whole team. Lundal sullenly refused my pleas for him to accompany us, Naliko was preoccupied by the illness sweeping through Tapuk, Tikka had recently discovered she was pregnant and was rightfully staying away from all battles, and Vindicus was still nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe rest of us followed our informant, who called himself Kiatori, to a crater on the west side of Mt. Tirkosu. The fissure led to a cave system that burrowed deep beneath the ground. And I mean deep. I'm no stranger to the depths of the earth, but the knowledge of all that weight on top of us was positively claustrophobic. We stopped when we were tired, but otherwise had no way of telling the day from night.\n\nAs we journeyed downwards, Kiatori told us about the subterranean world that had been living beneath us well before the First War. Not only dark elves lived in the down deep, but also a shadowy version of each of the main races of Tirkosu. The Orcs were apparently the counterparts of the Goliaths, and the only type of \"dark mirror\" race that wasn't affected by sunlight; that explained why marauding tribes of them kept popping up from apparently nowhere. After we had spent roughly a week struggling through musty caverns filled with giant mushrooms, narrow passages churning with water, and steep descents down jagged crevasses, we set up camp in a small antechamber to a larger cave. I had only slept for a mere twenty minutes before Della shook me awake. She had taken first watch, and had as usual used the time to pray to the Supreme One. Her prayer had apparently been answered, as a shimmering portal now stood in the center of our camp through which we could glimpse a vast ravine layered with small huts. We had reached the city of the dark elves.\n\nWe stepped through. The portal closed behind us. Our estimation about the time of day must have been correct; that, or it was usual for what passed as streets in the city to be empty. Kiatori pointed out the prophet's residence, a fairly large palace-like hut at the bottom of the ravine. We leapt down from our entrance, swinging from the many thick webs that criss-crossed the rift. A few guards spotted us and hurled some spears our way. We ignored them, pushing forwards until we reached the palace.\n\nThe prophet was not at home. In fact, there was a remarkable lack of military might being thrown our way. We breezed through what little soldiers were stationed there, charging into the throne room only to be greeted by a priestess of some sort. She spoke our tongue, and told us we were too late; that already, the Elder Eye's prophet was leading the united army of dark mirror races against the people of our world. She mocked us, telling Kiatori that he was a fool to think they would let him escape to alert us; they had carefully planned their attack to coincide with our journey to their dark realm. Our early arrival was unexpected, but she believed we were nonetheless helpless against the Eye's glorious onslaught.\n\nShe believed wrong.\n\nWhile Flamer melted her from the inside out, Della once more called upon her God to take us back to the surface. We were directly transported back to the temple in Hepthurai. A worried looking Antan informed us that a huge army of the shadow races had risen from the old mine in the center of the island, splitting into five groups and converging on certain villages. Karu Sampur and Gokapu had been hit badly, as had Pehkeiai. Pernep had also been hit, but most of the inhabitants had miraculously managed to escape. Tapuk was the only village that had been able to hold back the invaders, partly due to the frigid conditions and partly due to the villagers' combat-oriented society. How long they could last was uncertain, however, as a new wave of Orcs were said to be planning a second march spearheaded by the prophet himself.\n\nI would have preferred that we all stayed together as a team. There was something wrong about the dark mirrors' tactics. Why would they attack Gokapu, or Pernep for that matter? Both were small villages of little to no significant tactical importance. In the former's case, the army even had to cross a significant patch of desert to get there. And when they took control of the village, they let its former inhabitants flee without giving chase. It made no sense, and until we figured out what they were up to I thought it best if the team didn't split up.\n\nSo, naturally, they decided to split up. Della and Korena headed to the center of Tirkosu to seal off the mine, Flamer flew to Karu Sampur to ensure his people were safe, and Inalak flew the tower to Paku with Jaques to make certain that Tikka hadn't been caught up in the fight. I decided to head to Tapuk to give Naliko some support.\n\nI arrived at the goliath village on the side of Mt. Tirkosu just after the sun had set. The onslaught had started, and Naliko was doing her best to hold the thuggish Orcs at bay. I joined the fray without a word, working with her to take down any enemy who crossed the summit.\n\nAnd there he was; the prophet of the Elder Eye. Tall, powerfully built, covered head to toe in dark violet armor, and wielding a heavy black sword like it was a child's toy. For a moment I though it could be Vindicus beneath the helmet, but I dismissed the idea: The former Grand High Commander was tall, but certainly not this tall.\n\nI charged towards him while raising Revenge in both hands for a killing blow from behind. He knelt in the snow and dropped a crystal on the ground in front of him. As he turned to face me, a beam of light shot from the crystal, streaking out across the island at a tremendous speed. It burned a fiery orange, large enough to see from miles away with the advantage of the mountain's height. It turned sharply when it had nearly reached the opposite end of the island, doing so again four times, in the sky above where I assumed the conquered villages lay.\n\nHe started towards me as the giant star unfolded before me over the island. I had seen these before in one of Lundal's tomes of magic, but never on such a scale. It was a summoning circle, the kind used to bring demons and other foul creatures into the world. Only it was a titanic version, centered directly over the middle of the island.\n\nThe prophet reached me, and our blades clashed. Naliko was swinging away at the Orcs behind us as our blades sparked and flashed in the orange light. We were both evenly matched, my furious slashes against his powerful blows. I am sure he would have bested me, had his fighting style not been eerily familiar. He parried a particularly vicious strike of mine and stepped back, switching his sword to his other hand.\n\nAnd then he let his glove fall to the ground, revealing a mechanical hand beneath the gauntlet. And it all came back; the broad shoulders, the deliberate yet powerful fighting style, even the way he held himself.\n\nClaye, my brother, removed his helmet and let it fall with his glove into the snow. An ebony fury burned in his eyes that matched the color of the sword he carried. He told me that he hated me. That he detested me for surviving the clash between Nurvureem and Imix while our mother had perished in the flames. That the Elder Eye was going to make me pay for my crime of surviving. That he was to be my executioner.\n\nI didn't know what to do. For once, I had no plan of action. I had nothing. Every single member of my family was gone. Yes, in my eyes, Claye was as good as dead. Worse, in fact. And I couldn't do a thing except stare at him uncomprehending.\n\nThen Naliko was flung into the snow beside me, blood running from her lip. She didn't even flinch, rolling back up and returning to the fray. That shook me from my stupor: whatever he was before, whoever he was to me, he was trying to kill my friends. I couldn't allow that.\n\nI roared as we charged each other again. The sound of our blades smashing into each other rang out across the mountain like thunder. We pummeled each other until we were both treading the edge between life and death. He realized that he couldn't beat me, and tried to run by teleporting away. My strength all but gone, I flung Revenge at his retreating back. The blade found a gap in his armor, piercing his neck and knocking him to the ground.\n\nI crawled over to him. His blood stained the surrounding snow crimson. He couldn't move: my final blow had severed his spinal cord. I cradled him in my arms, noticing that his eyes had returned to the brown hue I remembered. He looked at me, and his gaze spoke louder than any words he could have uttered. He was sorry for what he had done. In his last moments, he was silently apologising for having let his emotions drive him.\n\nI looked at Naliko, heroically downing the last of the Orcs, and remembered her ready forgiveness of those who had wronged her. How could I not give the same to my own kin?\n\nClaye Bridgewater died in my arms as, between the tears, I told him he was forgiven over, and over again.\n\n* * *\n\nI believe I must have been concussed for a time. I remember coming to my senses back in Hepthurai, having no idea how I had got there. Naliko had accompanied me there. In fact, all of the Tsethem had finally gathered together with the exception of Lundal and Vindicus.\n\nDella and Korena had returned from the mines bearing news that weighed greatly on our hearts; the giant summoning circle had activated the elemental nodes located beneath the ground, allowing the princes of the apocalypse to emerge. Olhydra, Ogrèmoch, and Yan-C-Bin walked once more upon Tirkosu. Della revealed that while praying to the Supreme One, she received a vision from which she learned that the they intended to reduce the island to an elemental chaos, thereby allowing the Elder Eye to enter our world. There was one problem: all four prime elements were required for the ritual cleansing, and Imix had been destroyed by our hand after the fall of Orthraze.\n\nSo first, they were headed to the Tiamat's temple in the volcano to summon the Queen of dragons to fill the Eternal Flame's place.\n\nThree of the most powerful beings of legend were loose on the world. The island was in panic. The elders were attempting to organize transport away from Tirkosu, hoping to reach new land by boat or airship. Calculations were being made as to how many refugees the floating tower could hold before it collapsed. We had failed our duty as Protectors.\nBut by the Supreme One himself, I wasn't going to give in that easily.\n\nI marshaled the Tsethem, and told them to prepare for a battle to end all battles. Even Tikka agreed to come, as she reasoned there was little sense in protected her unborn child if the princes succeeded. I got Flamer to fly me to Little Orthraze, and confronted Lundal. He was at first reluctant to join us, but I managed to persuade him to at least pilot the tower. We may have fought a little, both verbally and physically. I wasn't sure; all my focus was on the coming fight.\n\nWe commandeered the last remaining airship and headed back to Hepthurai, where we were greeted by the first good news I had heard in a long time. Vindicus was back from wherever he had vanished to, and he had brought some friends: two silver dragonborn who introduced themselves as Kilmorn and Pekeski, a serious young huntress from Pernep named Callie, a smart alek girl from Gokapu called Vanella and her warforged companion Elo, and a pale knight who went by the name of Angelica. Vindicus explained that he had met them defending Pernep against the dark elves, and cited them as the reason so many of the villagers had survived. They had agreed to fight by our side, despite my warning that this was most likely a suicide mission.\n\nWe boarded the airship and headed towards the volcano. Lundal and Inalak flew the tower a short way behind us. They weren't going to enter the fray immediately: I had a plan for them.\n\nOgrèmoch stood between Olhydra and Yan-C-Bin, poised on the threshold of the temple's entrance. Of all the princes, my anger towards him was the most heated. The abomination of elemental earth slowly turned his cruel eyes to look at us as we crashed the airship into the volcano's side and leapt out to engage. He nodded to his brother and sister, who advanced towards us while he turned back to the temple and began lumbering towards its center.\n\nThe first seconds of the melee were fast, exhilarating, and mostly in our favor. Myself and the Tsethem were at the peak of our power: unstoppable forces of nature in our own right. The addition of Vindicus' friends were a huge blessing, as their combat skills were surprisingly advanced. Angelica wielded what appeared to be a sword made of pure light against Olhydra, which dealt substantial damage. Jaques's wristblades scythed through Yan-C-Bin's whirling air currents, the sheer speed of his blows countering the force of the flow. Both of them seemed to be helpless against our onslaught.\n\nThey must have been holding back, thinking they could save their energies for Tiamat's summoning. It was the only explanation for the sharp upswing in their power. They unleashed the full strength of their might against us, raw elemental energy coursing through our bodies as we desperately tried to shield ourselves. Vanella and Kilmorn dropped unconscious. Della was blown backwards, wounded but still with us. Flamer had transformed himself into a giant mechanical creature with a smashing tail and heavy armor, but even he was knocked back into his true form by the shock wave. As I lay there, stunned into inaction, I realized the soul-chilling truth: we couldn't beat them. We weren't going to make it. As Olhydra threw Pekeski and Naliko back in a torrent of water, she turned her evil gaze upon me and I knew that, after all I had been through, my time was up.\n\nThen Lundal smashed into the ground in front of the Crushing Wave, his steam powered exo suit taking the brunt of the damage. Inalak drifted to the ground on his own magic behind him. Lundal emptied the ammunition of his cannon arm into Olhydra, freezing her enough to land a solid blow and push her back into Yan-C-Bin. Even from behind, I could tell he was grinning as he uttered the words \"Sweet dreams, princess\".\n\nAnd the floating tower plummeted directly onto them. Lundal had timed it perfectly. The ground shook as air and water were mashed between tower and volcanic rock. The tower split into three, the debris and rubble obscuring the area. When the dust settled, there was nothing to be seen of either Olhydra or Yan-C-Bin.\n\nI felt a mechanical hand in mine, and turned to see Flamer carrying Della. His whole body was alight in flames, but both of us appeared to be unharmed by them. He made sure my grip was strong and then launched us towards the temple's centre at a breakneck speed. I felt Della closing my wounds with her magic, but kept my eyes fixed dead ahead on Ogrèmoch.\n\nHe was chanting something in what I believe was Primordial. Perhaps the fool thought he could summon Tiamat alone. We alighted not thirty feet from him. I held out a hand, stopping my friends from advancing further. One warning glance was all they needed to understand: this was my fight.\n\nThere, above the thrashing lava in the temple of the dragon queen, earth met earth. Never since the colossals themselves walked upon the lands has Tirkosu even seen such a battle. The raw power of our blows shook the very foundations, bringing beams and slate down upon us. We were evenly matched in skill and purpose: Ogrèmoch, fueled by hate and vanity, and I, Megan Turf Bridgewater, driven by the righteous wrath and the desire to rid the world of this stain upon the purity of earth.\n\nIn that moment, locked in combat with a being so alike, and yet so alien, I felt truly alive.\n\nWhen the rest of the Tsethem caught up to us, Ogrèmoch was gone; vanquished by my own blade and cast down to the volcano's core. The world was safe once more.\n\n* * *\n\nOur work was not yet done. The princes of the apocalypse were no more, yet their master still remained. His influence could and would extend across the island again if left unchecked. Upon closer inspection of the sword Claye had wielded, Lundal learned that it's origins were not of this world, but from a plane of reality which was only spoken of in legends. He also revealed why Claye's skills had apparently improved: the bearer could slow down time around themselves, allowing them to calculate their blows to perfection.\n\nDella was able to create a portal for us using the sword as a conduit. While the rest of the Tsethem and their new allies prepared to head out and rid the villages of the dark mirrorers, I, Lundal, Flamer, and Della stepped through the border between two worlds.\n\nWe were prepared for the fight of our lives. We were challenging a power greater than the princes, greater than even Tiamat herself. We expected a giant reptilian eye to glare down at us from on high. We did not expect a thin, broken being chained to an endless void. His head was devoid of hair, his eyes covered by a thin layer of unhealthy grey skin. And when he spoke, even though his voice was cracked with age, we knew who it was we faced.\n\nTiseo. Tiseo was the Elder Eye.\n\nHe commended us. Told us we had done well, as usual. We asked him how he had escaped Orthraze to get to the void realm. He told us that he hadn't: he was, in fact, still locked away in the ruins, plotting his revenge. And yet, he was also here, the mastermind behind all our sorrows.\n\nHe explained that time in the void was relative, and subject to one's will. He demonstrated by turning back the clock ten hundred years. We watched through the portal as Orthraze built itself back up, spasmed through decades of prosperity and war, then desettled itself until it was nothing but agricultural land. Then tangled wilderness. Then volcanic ooze from the dawn of time.\n\nI told him that nothing was making sense as he flicked the time back to when we had entered the plane. He sighed and started to explain:\n\nIn the beginning, in another life, we had not faced the elemental cults at all. We were simply the ones to retrieve the Forever Stone for Tiseo. The lack of the threat from the cults meant that Tiseo had shown his true nature much earlier, and had been foiled the same as he had in our version of reality. He had been sealed away in the void instead of being imprisoned in Orthraze, as Orthraze itself still stood in that reality. He had discovered how to manipulate the plane's loose rules over time, and had sewed the seeds to start the elemental cults under the guise of the Elder Eye. This created a paradox where Tiseo existed in two seperate places: waiting on Tirkosu for the time to strike with his dragon cult, and trapped as the Eye in the void.\n\nHe went on to tell us that as time was relative in his prison, killing him would undo his interferences with our timeline. Effectively, everything would be reset to the day he first contacted the princes of the apocalypse: which was thousands of years in our past. We had a choice: wipe our existence clean and doom history to repeat itself over and over, or let him live to spread his deceit and hatred across the ages. Either way, he won.\n\nWe were dumbfounded. Every battle fought, every sweat broken, every life lost: all to play right into our enemy's hands. No way to win, every way to lose.\n\nAs we stood there, he began to mock us. His ragged laughter making our hair stand upon end. As if things weren't complicated enough, he told us that this wasn't the first time we had encountered him here: we had been in this position through countless versions of reality, each time deciding to kill him. As he was the center of the paradox, he remembered it all. I asked why the Tiseo back on Tirkosu kept to the same doomed path if he knew how it was going to play out.\n\nThe Elder Eye's mouth formed a soulless smile, and he said that he kept the circle whole because he enjoyed watching us suffer. He enjoyed seeing the town of Rahg Krahv bombed, he reveled in the misery the fall of Orthraze caused, he rejoiced as I and my brother clashed on the peak of Mt. Tirkosu, again and again throughout endless realities.\n\nI broke. I stepped towards the pitiful monster and stabbed it through the heart.\n\nDella cried out and Lundal swore, both of them rushing forwards to stop the Eye from passing and resetting time. I held up a hand and showed them the weapon I had used: the voidblade forged by the Eye and given to Claye. The sword who's properties I now understood.\n\nA killing blow would freeze a being in time. Not just through one instance of time, but through the whole passage: they would become immovable, chained to their existence in the past and future. I realized the Eye must have created it as a safeguard to consolidate his presence in the event that Tiseo deviated from his original path. Now, it was to be his downfall: frozen for all time as his actions were anchored in history like a fossil.\n\nThe empty nothingness slowly fell away as the pathetic being that had once been Tiseo crumbled to dust. Beyond the darkness lay a field of silver grass, on which stood a myriad of ancient archways. Through each portal we could glimpse a plane filled with one of the ten elements of Tirkosu. The heavens opened, quite literally, and an intensely bright light shone down from the rift. A powerful voice told us that we had proven ourselves worthy. Worthy to become the true princesses and princes of the elements.\n\nWe accepted. We knew it would be a great responsibility to become rulers, but if this being thought we were worthy, who were we to refuse? Flamer asked a favor: to say our goodbyes to the people of Tirkosu. He granted our wish, and we returned once more to the volcano's peak. The rest of the Tsethem and Vindicus' allies had not yet set off to take on the dark mirrorers. We told them the Eye was vanquished, sparing them the mind-numbing complications. We also told them that we had to leave.\n\nThey gave us a heartfelt goodbye. Vindicus actually showed a little emotion. Korena cried, as did Tikka. Jaques and Inalak solemnly shook our hands and promised to tell of our legend to all the people of the island. Naliko gave a few casual remarks about how she knew we were keeping something from her, which we in turn casually ignored.\n\nDella turned to Vindicus' allies. She told them that they had fought admirably, and shown bravery beyond expectation; it would be an injustice not to give the title of Tsethem to those who desired it. The dragonborn Kilmorn stepped forward and received her blessing as the new protecter of the air.\n\nFlamer gave the position of fire Tsethem to Elo the warforged, who promised to continue his search for a new source for their people.\n\nLundal quipped if Vanella would like his title, which she agreed to with equal snark.\n\nI rested my hand on Callie's shoulder. Although she was a human hailing from Pernep, I had noted that her bow was of the Dwarven kind. I didn't need to say anything, and neither did she. One nod, and the mantle of earth Tsethem had passed between us.\n\nWe stepped through the portal, each heading to our respective kingdoms; the princesses and princes of the elements.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd that is where our tale ends. It feels like I have tarried far too long in this world between the worlds, even though time has no meaning here. From Berserker, to Adventurer, to Tsethem, to Princess of earth. It has been a long journey. I am not sure what I intend to do with this manuscript. Perhaps I shall drop it back through the portal so the people of Tirkosu can learn the truth. Perhaps I shall bring it with me to the earthen kingdom, to store in a library. If they even have libraries. So much to learn. A whole realm to discover, govern, and protect.\n\nIt would appear that, even though the tale of the Tsethem has ended, my own story is merely beginning.\n",

        "text": "So I was running a fairly average high fantasy campaign and my players decided to do their usual derailment of my planned story. I didn't really mind as it was a fairly impromptu game and I didn't have much planned. I decided to let them have free reign and I would free form it as I want along. So anyway the players went on a bit of a spree of thievery, killing some drunken townsfolk in a tavern brawl and decided to out right murder the mayor's son because he was a bit of an obnoxious twit that abused the peasants and felt up a tavern girl the party spoke to.   \n\nAnyway the next town they get to I had put up some wanted posters. I had decided to have a little fun by giving the players some typical outlaw names. So the party was looking at the bounties for “The Green Hood”, “Dark Fire” and “Lady Heartless”. I described to them the descriptions of the bounties and lists of crimes. Well I sat there smugly waiting for the revelation that never came. It turns out my players decided to turn bounty hunters for the adventure and set off asking around for this trio of villains.   \n\nI decided to play along as they investigated themselves and tracked them back to the last town they had just been to. Still they didn't realize! I sent guards and other bounty hunters after them, but they were convinced that it was all a case of mistaken identity as they had many similarities to the party they were hunting. They persuaded some of the guards of this fact and fought off one group of vigilantes. I was struggling to keep a straight face now as more investigation pointed them in the direct of the location were they had first seen the bounties forcing them to back track again!  \n\n\nMy players were complaining now that this was getting silly! At one point I had to excuse myself from the room  I was laughing so hard as my players moaned at going around in circles. The session ended shortly afterwards as I told them they would have to resume their search next game.    \n\nAfter the game were were hanging out eating pizza when one of my friends suddenly cursed. “I’m The Green Hood aren't I?” in the most mortified voice I have ever heard from him. We all had a good laugh about it and it's now a running joke that every villain in my campaigns is secretly them.  \n\nAnyone else done anything similar?",

        "text": "(Wish I could post this in one shot, but it appears that it's too long for reddit's character limit)\n\n([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5fg90z/dd_5e_epic_tales_from_empai_tirkosu_the_tsethem/))  \n\n* * *\n\n**In Which We Discover The Circle**\n\nThe fall of Orthraze changed the lives of people all over the island, including our own. Although the Grand High Commander had fallen in the assault, the Dark Elves had been purged from the city. Those who did not perish in combat took their own lives before they could be interrogated. Not one survived to answer our questions: Why had Nurvureem attacked? Why did the Elves turn upon her in favor of Imix? Where had they even come from? These questions haunted our thoughts, and their answers remained elusive. \n\nOrthraze was uninhabitable. You didn't need to be attuned to the arcane to see  it. The whole city was shrouded in constant darkness, and there were numerous sightings of ghosts and undead within its walls. The survivors (humans, Dwarves, and Gnomes) had salvaged what they could and prepared to leave for greener pastures. They saw us as their saviours, which in a way, we were. We were objectively the most capable leaders at the time. They named us \"Tsethem\", which is elvish for protector. We each took up the role of shepherd and guided our new flocks to greener pastures. \n\nFlamer had gathered the remaining warforged and traveled to a small volcano island in the northeast. There they had built a village out of the remains of a cargo airship that had crashed into the shore a few years back. They used the steady run of lava as a means of forging metal into tools and machical parts, and started trading with the other villages. The village was name \"Karu Sampur\", which in elvish literally means \"crashed ship\". \n\nLundal decided to lead his Gnome kin to Little Orthraze, a seaside town a couple of miles from the city. He did this partly because it was impossible to make a long journey with all the junk and machinery they had salvaged, and partly because he was lazy. He soon handed the mantle of leadership over to the oldest and wisest member of his tribe. The rest of us followed his example in the following months, as we found we were simply not cut out for the role. We instead acted more as militant guardians, leaving the everyday problems to a mutually elected elder. \n\nNot many humans made it out of the city alive. Those that did journeyed to the eastern part of the island where the land was barren and dry. There had been rumors of rich oil deposits in the Gokapo mesa, and the suddenly poverty-stricken humans wanted to tap into it to regain some of their lost capital. You would think, given their intelligence, that they would have settled in one of Tirkosu's less arid regions, but human greed combined with desperation overrode all logic. The oil turned out to be less than abundant but the discovery of a water source allowed them to survive and settle. \n\nI took charge of the Dwarves, in part because as a society that gravitated towards the underground, I felt we shared a common affinity. My second reason was the death of my mother and brother. I had never been close to Claye, and mom's assumptions about my calling had always infuriated me, but kin is kin. Their deaths, and the knowledge that I could have, should have been protecting them... I just needed a task to focus on. The Dwarves already respected me for my part in the battle of Orthraze, so it did not take long to also gain their trust. We traveled around Mt. Tirkosu to its southern side, and there we started to carve a village out of the rock using the combined forces of their skill and my elemental weapon. I was extremely careful not to push it to its limit, as releasing the shard inside could very well have the same effect as when Flamer broke Tinderstrike. It took a little while, but eventually we had a home to live in once more. We named it \"Sovu Vapohu\", which is Elven for \"safe haven\". I carved a tomb for my mother, and buried her there. There was no such rest for Claye; a horribly maimed hand was the largest piece they could find of him.\n\nDella was the only one out of the four of us who did not take an active role in rehabilitating the former citizens of Orthraze. We didn't blame her: she needed some time to get used to her new state. She spent some time up in Hepthurai with the Aarakocra, learning the art of controlling air from Antan. The wisdom of the bird people helped her find peace with herself. \n\nOur story picks up again about a year after the fall of Orthraze. I was taking care of some Orcs that were threatening to raid Sovu Vapohu. An elf bearing a message from Kuama, elder of Paku, approached me as I was demonstrating the effectiveness of a new blade I had found in an expedition in the ruins. It was a giant red and black meatcleaver, requiring two hands to be held correctly. It had a fondness for separating heads from necks, as the Orc chief was currently discovering. \n\nOnce the war party had retreated in humbled silence, I gave my attention to Kuama's messenger. He told me that he there had been multiple raids upon both the Elven and Mermish villages along the east of the island. The attackers had taken anything of wealth along with a fair few prisoners. They had last been seen heading into the ruins before disappearing completely. I was required to attend a council with the elders of all the villages being held at Little Orthraze. With the Orcish threat behind us for the moment, I bade my farewells and set out for the seaside town. \n\nThe sight of a flying tower is not an easy one to comprehend. Back when we were combating the elemental cults, we stormed one of their strongholds; a large, tiered turret that tapered at the base and was crowned by a ring of fire like the kind used on the airships of old. We had cleared it of cultists and used it to transport their prisoners to their respective homes. We abandoned it when we journeyed underground to battle Vanifer, and had not seen it since. And yet there it was, suspended above Little Orthraze like a bizarre seahorn. \n\nIt had been piloted there by a group of six people who were also present at the council. They told a tale of adventure and daring to rival my own exploits. They had discovered the raiders and ousted them from their camp, discovering that they were part of another cult dedicated to dragons. They had pursued them across the island and into the ruins of Orthraze, facing many perils on the way. A portal hidden within the city had led them to a human village in the south known as Pernep, where they had discovered the tower being used as a lair by a white dragon. The riches and prisoners were still missing, but they had actually managed to take back the tower from the cult's grasp. I was impressed, to say the least. \n\nI had best take time to describe them now, as the following half of the tale is as much theirs as it is mine, Lundal's, Della's, and Flamer's. \n\nJaques Torrem is a young man with spiky hair and a fierce personality. He had lost his parents in the bombing of Rahg Krahv, and his younger sister to a group of water cultists residing in Orthraze. He had been the one to rescue the Grand High Commander, and fight alongside the rebels against the Dark Elves. He is, in a word, intense.\n\nTikka is the granddaughter of Kuama, the Elven chiefiten. She had also been present at the fall of Orthraze, fighting side by side with Jaques. The two seemed to be good friends. She was vivacious, and a little disrespectful of her grandfather. \n\nInalak Onakea is also from the Elven village. He was seeking to pay the dragon cultists back in kind for the attack on his village. His pleasant attitude and mellow view on life made him the easiest of the six to get along with. \n\nNaliko Icestalker is a strange, strange little Goliath girl. From what I could gather, her parents had abandoned her because they thought she was too weak to survive the harsh climate the Goliath tribe lives in. They thought wrong; she survived on the cold slopes of Mt. Tirkosu by joining and eventually taking leadership of a pack of wolves. She wears dark clothing and peers out at people from under her hood, making inappropriate comments at choice moments. She is very strange, but ultimately likeable in a curious manner. \n\nKorena Ionu is a lightborn who hails from Appinamopu Tharth. Although a year older than Della, she idolized her and wished to become a Tsethem herself. She had traveled from the temple with the head priest, a handsome lightborn called Tiseo. He had lead the original strike against the dragon cult raiders, and was acting as the effective head of the council. He had an calm yet focused demeanor that I thought spoke of an inner wisdom.\n\nAnd last, but most certainly not least, is Vindicus. None of us trusted him except Naliko and Della. Korena insisted there was an aura of evil about him. Della agreed, but gave her word that he was trustworthy, implying that she knew something we didn't. We never saw his face during this time; he wore full black plate mail at all times, with an angular helmet that left no feature exposed. On the rare occasion that he spoke, his voice was hoarse and broken. I didn't like him. I didn't trust him. But Della's word is her word, so we tolerated his presence. \n\nTiseo decided to split us into teams to cover more ground. Me and flamer were sent to investigate the portal in the ruins. It took us a while to clear the area of vengeful Dark Elf spirits. He assumed that the dark energy that permeated the city was somehow manifesting itself as shadows of the deceased warriors. I thought that the spirits were simply their souls, trapped in the world because of their evil deeds. We agreed on one thing; they were definitely evil. It took several days to destroy the ones we could find, and we were sure that wasn't all of them. \n\nWe returned just in time for another council session. Lundal seemed troubled, but as usual he kept his feelings hidden when approached. Upon questioning Korena I learned that they had encountered an imprisoned fire genie who had promised Lundal a wish were he to destroy his cage. Lundal wisely refused at the time, no doubt remembering the tales of the treacherous Efreet, but his melancholy indicated that his mind still lingered on what could have been. \n\nGlancing back at my notes so far, I appear to have neglected to mention one of our little group: a relatively unimportant member, but a member nonetheless. I suppose Nora has always been like that. Lundal discovered her when we were traveling through a subterranean lake, a little brown octopus with only seven tentacles. She clung to the bow of our boat as we stealthily paddled our way forward, and Lundal took an immediate liking to her. She followed us about, clinging to his head like a bizarre hat. In time, she became as essential to his attire as the dark goggles he perpetually wore. He named her Nora. It was only during a drunken party in Orthraze that he told us why he had picked that specific name. \n\nDuring his time as a mechanic in the First War, Lundal had courted and won the heart of a young gnome woman. He described her as utter perfection: sweet, funny, intelligent, loyal... He was happier than he'd even been in his life. So when she was killed in an aerial strike, he was more than heartbroken. His spirit was crushed. His work suffered, and he was laid off. He was a broken gnome. \n\nAnd the genie had brought it all back to him. He had been given the opportunity to change the very fabric of reality, to rewrite the tragedy. Of course, he hadn't taken the offer. Lundal is far from stupid, and he knew full when that the genie would not keep his word. But the possibility, the idea that he could see his beloved Nora again ate at him like a worm. \n\nThere was no time to console him, though. It was clear now that we were facing a much larger and more organized threat than we had originally anticipated. Tikka, Jaques, Vindicus and Naliko had encountered multiple groups of well armed cultists, one of which had actually had a real dragon with them. It was a mere youngling, but it still took everything they had to bring it down. Their efforts were rewarded, however, as they learned the location of the cult's leader and base of operations. \n\nThere were two main complications, of course. Firstly, they were situated not four miles from Karu Sampur. Secondly, a large portion of the warforged living there had risen up against Flamer under a new leader. Tiseo was gathering an army from the surrounding villages, but before we could launch an assault on the volcano we had to make sure we wouldn't meet resistance from the warforged on the beach. I was sent to adjudicate where their loyalties lay, along with Della, Flamer and Korena. \n\nA warforged called Veetoo was spearheading the uprising. She wasn't the well-built, compact build that was standard for most of her kind. Instead she was a prototype model that had been developed towards the end of the First War and never approved for mass production. Much sleeker, much more deadly, and without the usual obedience inhibitors of her peers. I could see why the military had been wary of creating more of her. \n\nWe were granted an audience with her, and she explained how things stood: she was on the fence about which side to join, and was contemplating what the outcome of the impending battle would be. She demanded to know details of the strategy the united villages were taking, which we begrudgingly gave. She seemed unimpressed, but told us she would consider it overnight and give us her verdict in the morning.\n\nThe dreams I had that night were... Vivid, to say the least. At most, they were hell upon earth. I would prefer not to revisit such painful memories, as they themselves do not contribute to the tale. Suffice to say that I became aware that Veetoo had planned to betray us, and was at this very moment sending her most magically knowledgeable warforged to aid the cultists in their ultimate goal: the summoning of Tiamat into the world. A titanic dragon with five heads (one for each prime element, and a fifth aligned to shadow), Tiamat is considered by many to be a simple myth. Apparently, Veetoo did not share that belief. \n\nFlamer used some of his magic to transport us back to Little Orthraze before the night was over. We waited impatiently for the rest of the team to return from the various missions they had been assigned to. I remember Korena remarking that she had heard Jaques complain that the missions seemed to be skirting the main issue, instead dealing with smaller and less important side-threats. I shrugged it off. From what I'd seen of Jaques, he seemed to be the impatient type. The Council knew what they were doing.\n\nAt long last we were all together again, and heading the small army that marched on the crater. We knew we'd have trouble with the warforged on the beach, but we were ready for them. We hauled the boats up the shore of Karu Sampur, and began the charge up the volcano. \n\nI cannot describe the sense of sheer pride I felt in seeing us fight together. Lundal had brought a giant exosuit with him and was obliterating cultists with a cannon arm. Della was ploughing through their ranks, wiping the ash and blood from her face. Flamer went hand to hand with Veetoo, downing her in an instant with a fireball. Both of Jaques' wristblades were flying faster than the eye could see. Tikka was right behind him, staving off kobolds with her rapier. Korena and Naliko were working in tandem to take down a young red dragon. Vindicus cleaved through warforged spellcasters like a scythe through grass. Inalak took on a major armored cultist riding a dragon all by himself, keeping him grounded by transforming his mount into a frog. \n\nWe reached the summit with hardly a scratch, which was fortunate because a far greater challenge awaited us. A crude temple of obsidian, volcanic rock and cooled lava had risen from the magma, smoke and fire rising off it like a bonfire. It was occupied by roughly twenty warforged, each one a powerful for on their own. In the center was a whirling vortex through which we surmised Tiamat was supposed to enter. \n\nWe kicked down the door and flattened them. No mercy was requested, and none was given. They were trying to destroy our world, and we were certainly not going to sit idly by. The head cultist was floating above the portal, chanting. Flamer went nova and tussled with him in mid air before letting his charred corpse drop through the portal. We never even learned his name. \n\nWe stood there for a little while, gathering our collective breaths. And then Vindicus removed his helmet. \n\nThe Grand High Commander stood before us, gaunt and grey. He explained to us that he had, in fact, perished in the fall of Orthraze. He had struck a deal with a devil to grant him unlife until he had destroyed every last being responsible for Nurvureem's attack on his city. Now that the head of the dragon cult was no more, he feared that his time among us was at an end. \n\nDella refused to give in. She removed her necklace, on which hung the Forever Stone, and gave it to the man who had given his life and death for his people. He took it with humble thanks, and swore to use his immortality for the greater good. \n\nAs we stepped out into the night, with the lava pouring down the sides of the volcano and a chill wind cooling our adrenaline-filled bodies, we finally understood: the elements were ours to protect. Not just because our villages needed leadership, or because we felt it was our duty. It was our destiny to safeguard our people against the forces of elemental evil. Since the dawn of time, we had been waiting for this moment. We were the Tsethem.\n\nThe Protectors of the world. ",

        "text": "#Tales from Empai Tirkosu: The Tsethem\n\n**Megan \"Turf\" Bridgewater**\n\nI have never been one for history. Most of my life has been focused upon moving forward, upon making a better future. But now, as I prepare to step from this world to the next, as I stand in the nexus of time and space itself, I feel a need to put pen to paper and make this record of our exploits. I am no master of the art of storytelling, but I will attempt to make what is in essence a list of facts an enjoyable read.\n\n* * *\n\n**In Which Legends Are Born**\n\nI suppose it all began with Della Yue. We met outside an outpost off the north coast of the island, where I had been deployed to negotiate with a marauding band of Orcs. And by negotiate I mean beat the bloodlust out of them. That's what I did, back then: I was one of the few Berserker units the military didn't send home after the First War ended. They told me I was the best they had ever seen. I didn't mind staying on. Going back to the city of Orthraze meant having to see my brother, Claye. It wasn't that he was unpleasant, it was that he always seemed to begrudge the fact that I had become the renowned warrior while he was stuck doing paperwork. We didn't dislike each other, but neither did we get along.\n\nShe was a pretty little half elf in a white veil and robe that bore the sign of the Supreme One. She explained that she had come from a temple down in the south called Appinamopu, and that she was putting together an archeological team to retrieve a lost artefact. I offered my services; as one born of a Dao, the prospect of a trip underground was enticing at the least.\n\nI was less than thrilled when I met the rest of our little party. Lundal was an ex-mechanic, a greasy little gnome who constantly wore goggles and too much hair gel, and Flamer was a warforged who had been given time off from the military. I had worked with many of his kind before, but there had been rumors among the infantry about an accident with an airship engine that had left him in a coma for a few weeks. Most of the stories about warforged going rogue are simply anti-machine tripe, but I wasn't too happy gambling my life on a \"most\". Introductions were made, and we set out to retrieve the Forever Stone.\n\nThe long and short of it is: we succeeded. We spent a few hours as gelatinous versions of ourselves, we nearly killed Flamer, and Della decided to sacrifice herself for her team. But we all survived, and we retrieved the Stone from the abandoned Dwarven mine it resided in. We discovered that the Stone extended the lifespan of the bearer to an almost infinite degree. Knowing that many an unworthy would attempt to possess it, we decided that Della should keep it safe, and that its recovery should be a secret. Nonetheless, as the first recorded group to survive the mine, we gain no small amount of fame.\n\nIt was roughly eight months before we met as a team again. Sharing near-death experiences is a sure way to form a bond, and I had met up with one or two at a time when my work allowed it. It was Della again who summoned us together.\n\nShe had discovered that a group of fanatical elemental worshipers had gathered at the centre of the island and were causing chaos on the trade routs. It didn't take too long for us to find their respective headquarters and demolish them. We were growing as a team, our tactics and style becoming smooth as clockwork. We'd sneak in, take out the head of the cult, and watch the acolytes run as their powerful leaders fell before us. Flamer had revealed his control over magic to us by this time, and his flame spells and ability to physically transform himself into mechanical animals were extremely helpful. It would have been even more helpful had they been a creature of the air, but we had to make do with octopi and bears. Della was surprisingly adept at combat, at times even besting myself. Lundal... He stabbed things a lot, and complained about how machines could do everything better.\n\nIt was at this time that the bodies of a human noble from Orthraze and an Aarakocra Monk were found in a cave with the symbol of an eye carved into their foreheads. I had no idea they were connected to our destiny. None of us did. To this day, we still don't know exactly why they were so far from home, or why they had to die. I can only assume they must have stumbled upon knowledge not fit to see the light of day.\n\nWhen the first bomb hit the town of Rahg Krahv, there was no doubt about who the culprits were. Four masked men wearing the symbol of the earthen cult marched into the middle of the square and detonated some kind of elemental explosive. Earthquakes shook every building into dust, destroying homes that had stood for centuries. Steam powered farming equipment was swallowed by cracks and crevasses forming in the ground. Roughly half the town's population were lost in the attack.\n\nWe hit back with everything we had. We decimated their ranks. We slew two of the heads, relinquishing their hold on a couple of weapons that seemed linked to their respective elements. We were desperate: at any moment, another bomb could go off in Orthraze, killing thousands upon thousands. It was when we confronted the third leader that we first encountered the Eye.\nIn one of the many caverns stood a huge obsidian pyramid. The head of the earthen cult, a Medusa, stood atop it, praying to a black marble effigy of a reptilian eye. The snake-haired creep ranted about how the Eye could see all, and about the ultimate doom of the world. We beat him back to the bedrock, doused the fire elemental Flamer accidentally created, and claimed the elemental weapon. It was a warpick forged of silver. By Tiamat, I loved that thing. Handled much better than a sword.\n\nWe found a tomb in an adjoining cave. It was carved from obsidian like the pyramid, and adorned with spider and web decorations. Lundal wanted to play graverobbers. I am eternally thankful that we managed to talk him out of it. Only the Supreme One knows what kind of horrific curse we would have unleashed had we not.\n\nAt long last we found a subterranean lake of lava upon which the final cultist stood: a horrific looking woman who went by the name of Vanifer. She had curved goat horns, jet black skin tinged with crimson, and a tail that looked like it belonged on a dragon. In fact, I can attest with a hundred percent certainty that looked exactly like a dragon tail. Why? Because there was a freaking fire wyrm sitting next to her for comparison.\n\nVanifer taunted us, professing that she was about to summon Imix. This name, along with those of Ogrèmoch, Yan-C-Bin, and Olhydra, should be no stranger to your ears. If they are so, then I admonish you and your kind for letting history slip into the realm of forgetfulness. They are the bane of the elements, the evil that perverts the purity of nature. They are nigh unstoppable; the princes of elemental evil. And Vanifer was about to bring one into our world.\n\nI do not think that we, as a team, have ever fought a more desperate battle and succeeded. The Dragon (who's name we did not learn) scorched us all in his fiery breath. Della and I hacked away at the beast, slowly chipping away at his scaly armor as Lundal tried and failed to slip past. Vanifer was near the end of her incantation. An Orb of magma materialised in the centre of the room, through which we could glimpse a land of pure fire. It seems that, after such a long crusade, we had failed our mission. Failed the people. Failed the world.\nAnd then, with the dull clank of metal upon metal we had grown to love, Flamer transformed himself; not into the customary bear or boar but into a giant, flame-pitted eagle. He spread his ebony wings and flew straight at Vanifer, slamming into her and sending her screeching into the lava lake. With a final thrust of my warpick, I smote the Dragon to the ground. We had claimed victory, and we found its taste delicious.\n\nWe recovered the fire weapon (a dagger which had unsurprisingly survived its little dip in lava) and headed home. We were treated as true heroes, and were presented with a medal of honor that Lundal turned down. He wasn't a big fan of the military, as they basically left him jobless after the first war and forced him to turn to crime.\n\nAnd I have just been informed that \"black market parts dealings\" sounds much better than crime, and that I should use that instead to preserve his image (what image??).\n\n* * *\n\n**In Which Things Take A Turn For The Worse**\n\nRoughly a year passed. Nothing worth going into detail with happened during this time. We helped retrieve some more lost artefacts, found an old wingsuits from an air cultist stash, and had an upsetting encounter with one of Della's fellow clerics, who had gone a little soft in the head. It was a fine evening in autumn when disaster struck.\n\nWe were watching the perfect orange sun sink below the sea from a docking bay as Flamer and Della prepared to embark on an airship that would take them South. The first sign that something was wrong was the wind - it was completely still. Stiller than still, as though the very air itself was trying to suffocate us. Then from behind Mt. Tirkosu rose the biggest dragon I have ever set eyes upon. The few illustrations of her I had studied paid poor homage to her rippling strength, her sheer size, the raw power emanating from her very presence. Nurvureem, the Dark Lady, had risen to put humanity in its place.\n\nI will not lie: there is something exhilarating about jumping off an airship to stab a dragon, then using a wingsuit to safely return to the ship. Maybe the thrills I was experiencing were a partial cause of our downfall: maybe we had become complacent in the year following our encounters with the elemental cult. Whatever the cause, we fell. Figuratively and literally. All I can remember is desperately defending Lundal's broken body before a torrent of shadowy dragon breath hit me like a brick wall, and then... Darkness.\n\nI came to as we were flying towards Hepthurai, the village of Aarakocra in the mountains. The airship was a different model from the one we used to combat Nurvureem. Flamer was piloting the ship, looking more charred than usual. Lundal was still unconscious, and Della was kneeling beside him as she prayed. It took a moment to realize what was wrong with her: her pointy elven ears had disappeared, and she was even shorter than usual. She was also weeping silently. Della, who had always been the moral backbone of the team, was crying. I had never seen her break before, and it scared me more than her physical transformation.\n\nFours days had passed since I died fighting the Dark Lady. Flamer was the only one to survive that fateful battle over Orthraze, and even he had barely managed to escape. Nurvureem had claimed the city and subdued its people. Any resistance from the military was wiped out by the Dragon, aided by a small army of dark skinned elves with white hair that seemed to have sprung out of nowhere. There were rumors that the Grand High Commander had survived, and was already gathering a ragtag group of Elves, Kor, and Goliaths to retake Orthraze. I thought it was a hopeless move; if the empire's best warriors couldn't take down the Nurvureem, then what chance did an untrained rebellion have?\n\nFlamer held up a hand, and asked to finish his story. And by the earth itself, had the following narrative come from anyone else, I would have thought them a lier.\n\nHe had summoned Imix. Desperate, his friends perishing in the chaos of Shadow behind him, he had done the only thing that could have made things worse. He traveled back into the mines, to the lava lake we had fought Vanifer on. He found a manuscript detailing the ritual, and, using the elemental knife dubbed \"Tinderstrike\", opened a portal for Imix to pass through. He had transformed himself into his fire avatar, and was able to pass as one of the Eternal Flame's minions. He praised the abomination he had summoned, then warned him of Nurvureem. He urged the living pillar of fire to destroy this threat before it became aware of his presence in her domain, as a show of his ultimate power. The vain elemental agreed, and set off to establish his new reign of fire.\n\nFlamer managed to get to the now shadow-smothered Orthraze at the same time as Imix. The Dark Lady was not expecting guests. She was not expecting her army of Dark Elves to turn on her and join the elemental's ranks. She fought long and ferociously, the clash between the two titans raging all over the city and destroying the few structures that still stood. The chaos gave Flamer time to sneak into the complex Nurvureem had been using as a base of operations. There he found our broken bodies nailed to the wall like trophies, raw shadow leaking out of our eyes and mouths. He carried us all to the last operational airship, a prototype kept in a hidden bunker. Only Della had the power to raise the deceased completely, so Flamer cast the one resurrection spell he knew that could bring her back to life: Reincarnation. Della had lost her elven heritage, becoming a full human. It could have been a lot worse. She could have ended up as an orc. But it was still a physical and emotional shock.\n\nWe landed at Hepthurai, and were met by an wizened old Aarakocra called Antan who was an instructor in the art of element bending. Everyone was avoiding Flamer. We didn't know wether to be furious with him or thankful. He had brought us back from the dead, but in doing so had unleashed a terror upon the world that dwarfed any threat Nurvureem had posed. Thankfully the Aarakocra seems to have a plan. Antan spoke of an ancient being of great power upon the mountain who would give us a chance against our foe. We traveled to the highest peak of Mt. Tirkosu and stumbled upon a frozen lake, in the middle of which sat an angel. Della awoke her, and she agreed to join our cause. I could not believe the evidence before my eyes. In my past I had given little thought to the concept of religion, assuming my mother's view that it was simply advanced superstition. And yet here was this creature of strength and beauty, confirming that Della's faith was not unfounded.\n\nWord had reached Hepthurai by the time we returned that the Grand High Commander was preparing a strike against the Dark Elves. We traveled to the elven village of Paku, a small cluster of treebound wicker huts located on the wester side of the jungle. Despite the proximity to Orthraze, this was my first visit to it. The villagers were mostly if not all Elven. Even a glimpse was enough to tell that they were a primitive but ingenious people, seamlessly meshing the more modern technology developed by humans with their tribal way of life. The Commander, a well built man with graying hair and a brusque attitude, was more than happy for us to take on Imix while they dealt with his unlikely army. He greeted Flamer like an old friend, a sentiment he only partially returned. Flamer had mentioned to us at one point that the Commander had wanted to terminate him after the accident that had granted him arcane power; warforged were not supposed to possess such abilities. Only the recommendation of Flamer's captain, a woman named Charlotta Veil, had saved him from incineration. Not that dropping him in a fire pit would have done much anyway.\n\nAs our ragtag army clashed against the combined forces of Dark Elves and fire elementals, we snuck behind enemy lines. I'm good at sneaking. Even better than Lundal, and he's spent his life breaking into secure military workshops. We made it to the complex Nurvureem had used as an HQ, hoping Imix would be thinking along the same lines. He was, and he wasn't happy to see us.\nWe struck fast, and we struck hard. Our otherworldly ally tore into the elemental with a righteous ferocity. But although she managed to damage him a fair amount, his raw power overwhelmed her, and she seared into oblivion in a burst of white light. We were facing Imix alone.\n\nPerhaps Flamer had sustained a serious mental injury in his accident all those many months ago. Perhaps he simply hung around with Lundal too much. Whatever the cause, he seems to have a penchant for pulling insane stunts when the going gets rough. We had learned that the weapons we had taken from the cult leaders contained a shard of their respective elemental prince. Flamer, without discussing with us, without thinking it through, snapped Tinderstrike in two. I think he believed it would consume our adversary, or some other such beneficial happening.\nInstead, a warped version of Imix blossomed from the splintered pieces and attacked his original self, destroying him. It then turned upon us.\nI honestly do not know how we survived. We were already scorched from attempting to face the first Imix, and there we were, taking him on all over again. We could have died.\n\nWe should have died.\n\nBut we survived, and we won. Burnt, bruised, and at the end of our tether. Standing in the ruins of our once glorious civilization. Surrounded by charred corpses and a perpetual shadow that had not faded along with Nurvureem. But alive.\n\nAlive and victorious.",

        "text": "Here's a quick story from my last session.  I had planned for this to be a relatively high stakes session, but my players escalated the level of peril they were in to an amazing level both literally and figuratively.  \n\nWe've been running a horror themed game for some time, and after all of the PCs were hit with various forms of indefinite insanity from a particularly brutal dungeon, we decided to roll up a B team of characters to rotate out with the A team whenever someone got messed up badly.  The B team consists of:\n\nXander the Suli Paladin\n\nCharles Human Psion\n\nRizko the Kobold Vigilante\n\nAfter the B team characters are introduced and have a bit of interaction with the A team, everyone feels the ground shake and runs out of the tavern to see somethign large, undead, and angry rising up on the other side of the city.  Our heroes take off running to face it, but quickly realize they need a faster mode of transport since the monster is several miles away.  Xander runs up to the nearest cab, climbs up onto the driver's seat as the other two hop in the back, and realizes he has no idea how to operate this thing.  This is somewhat more modern setting, so all the carriages are pulled by clockwork horses, which of course don't operate in the same manner as actual horses.  None of the PCs have the requisite skills to drive one of these, but that doesn't stop them from trying.  Rizko joins Xander on the driver's seat, grabs the control rod and gestures randomly with it.  The cab takes off straight ahead and Xander grabs the rod back as he realizes Rizko knows nothing about this either.  Inside the carriage, Charles begins to have second thoughts about getting in this cab with these guys he's just met.  \n\nXander and Rizko somehow manage to make the turn ahead as they fight over the control rod, although the horse accelerates to full speed at the same time.  Rizko decides that the shortest route to her goal is a straight line, and casts Fly on the horse.  As the two would-be drivers fight for control of the rod, the cab rises above the buildings, levels off, then pitches straight down.  Panicking and being thrown around in the back of the cab, Charles decides that the odds of the other two pulling the cab out of this dive are not good and decides to take action.  He casts [Planar Travel](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/p/planar-travel) without specifying his intended destination.  It is important at this time to describe how this power actually works.\n&gt; \n&gt; You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the power at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Planar travel transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including manifesting planar travel again).\n&gt; \n&gt; Augment For every two additional power points spent, the number of d% rolled is reduced by 1, to a maximum of -5, when the power places you at your intended destination.\n\nI roll for a random plane.  The cab and its passengers disappear and reappear in the elemental plane of water.  Xander and Rizko make their saves and manage to hold their breath against the sudden wall of water that hits them, but Charles isn't so lucky.  Fortunately he manages to cast Planar Travel again before he gets a lungfull of water and loses consciousness.  This time he declares his destination, right above the giant monster, and spends two extra power points to remove one percentile from the inaccuracy roll.  Behind my screen my eyebrows raise.  \"Are you sure?\"  Foolishly Charles tells me 'yes,' and I roll 4d100 and a random direction to see how far from their intended destination they end up.\n\n**157 miles.  Straight up.**\n\nFor a frame of reference, anything that could even loosely be considered an atmosphere ends about 60 miles up.  \n\nThe cab is still accelerating, now aided by gravity and unhindered by air resistance.\n\nI do some quick math and tell the party they've got about 45 minutes before they hit the atmosphere and burn up on re-entry.\n\nXander and Rizko can hold their breath for about 1.5 and 1 minutes respectively.  Charles is unconscious and on the verge of death.\n\nThere's one slim hope available:  Rizko's portable hole.  Rizko opens the hole, jumps in with Charles, and Xander closes the hole.  Charles is revived and comes up with a plan.  After one minute, Xander opens the hole again.  Charles exits and uses Planar Travel again to send them all to the elemental plane of air.  Still flying along at breakneck speed, Charles manages to mind control an air elemental and commands it to get onboard.  He shifts the cab back to the elemental plane of water, using the water's high resistance to burn off speed now that a steady air supply has been obtained in the form of the air elemental.  The uncontrolled cab runs down a few unsuspecting water elementals in the minute or so it's there.  Finally, Charles burns through 19 power points to return to the material plane with no inaccuracy.  Rizko casts Fly on Xander and jumps out with him and Charles jumps out on the back of the captured air elemental as the cab falls about a hundred feet down onto the head of the monster.\n\nI think the only way things could have escalated more quickly is if they had accidentally crashed through the home of one of the gods on their mad joyride.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5fd4hc/adeptus_evangelion_the_curious_case_file_of_aiden/",
        "text": "I think every gamer has been part of a game that was an utter clusterfuck. They must, if all the reddit and /tg/ forums about problem players and shitty GMs are anything to go by. In the five years I've been playing, I've been in something like three games that fell under the definition of clusterfucks. Ironically, the one I remember most fondly of those three was the one that I unintentionally was both the Alpha and Omega for.\nSee, this was a game that I floated to my friends during a social gathering of some sort. Everyone comes across an unusual RPG that they somehow sell to their friends and wring a few sessions out of, and for me that RPG was Adeptus Evangelion. For reference, Adeptus Evangelion was a mod for Dark Heresy that focused on being the traumatized anime waifus in the giant mechs. Somehow, no doubt attributable to the forever-GM being a huge fan of Evangelion, I managed to pitch this RPG to my friends. \nThe end result? An RPG so dysfunctional that it made the plot of Evangelion look like Harry Potter. Our group had a total of four players and the GM, but out of the ten or so sessions only one was ever attended by everyone. For the most part, the recurring aliases were as follows:\n\nThe GM: The gamerunner and host. He was something of a rules lawyer and min-maxer, and while he put a lot of emphasis on player freedoms most of his prior games wracked up pretty respectable body-counts.\n\nSpeedwagon: The guy who played the Operations Director. Speedwagon was a silly, womanizing, drug-abusing incompetent, played on a really bizarre point between goofy and serious. Speedwagon was tied with Aiden for being the most attention-taking PC, and his player was the only one aside from me to make every session. I can't remember his stats, partially because the stats that mattered were often undercut by the man's own actions.\n\nAnd then there was me. I played Aiden Tanner, pilot of Unit-05 and the one who would eventually become something like a main character for the game. I wanted to try and pare closely to Evangelion's normal “screwed up kid piloting a mech” theme, so I envisioned Aiden as a quiet and unassuming character who had little to no sense of self-preservation. In terms of mechanics, I built Aiden and Unit-05 to be extremely tough. Decent willpower and sync ratio stats on the former, lots of armour on the latter.\n\nOur setting matched our characters perfectly. The GM wanted to run what he imagined an Americanized Evangelion would look like, and as a result the game took place in a post-Impact world where Stephen Colbert (the character, not the actor) had become the president of the United States and the Angels were affiliated (or so it seemed) with a terrorist group. The Nerv base was situated in a corporate town called Alegria (pronouned All-lay-gree-a, I think). It was this weird sort of artificial town settled on the riverbed, equal parts co-opted Mesoamerican architecture and gentrified corporate garbage.\n\nAs you can see, humanity was screwed from the outset.\n\nOur first session began with a brief explanation of the above, followed by the various characters arriving in Alegria by various means. In Aiden's case, being disgorged from her mother's car and watching the only other human being she had any connection with race off into the sunset. No time for drama, though, a state of emergency was being called! Why? A large egg was floating over towards the remnants of Norfolk, Virginia, now rendered into a number of small islands due to rising sea levels. UN forces were already (uselessly) engaging the thing, and they needed support. This would be the first outing, with a total of five Evas being deployed to put an end to this threat. The pilots were prepped for combat while Director Speedwagon was briefed on the scenario. \n\nWell, sorta. In practice, it was more the pilots being shepherded into their Evas with minimal information while Speedwagon hit on the base commander unsuccessfully.\n\nThen, for whatever the reason, one of the Evas just wouldn't start. The NPC pilot inside was losing her shit over the radio, and the technicians weren't having any luck resolving whatever was wrong. We needed to be in our carriers, and we were being delayed. All the while Speedwagon was continuing the hit on the commander, who eventually had him thrown out of the bridge for insubordination. First session, and already we have a rift between the OD and the rest of the bridge. First session, and one of the Evas just doesn't work. We hadn't even reached combat yet, and already the tone of the game had been set in stone.\n\nFinally everything is put in order and the Evas that would actually start are loaded onto carriers and jetted towards their destination. In the time this cost us, the actual Alpha-6 emerged from the egg. In terms of appearance, the creature looked like a giant protozoa with a wide, gaping mouth and entirely too many arms. We placed ourselves on the edge of the battlefield, preparing for our epic confrontation with our first Angel. In doing so, we made our first tactical error.\n\nSee, the DM was very strict about our power supplies. We only had something like fifteen turns to move, assuming we didn't detach from our umbilicals and switch to battery mode (which reduced that to three). Once we ran out, the encounter would be over. Naturally, having been lined up like a bunch of WWI Brits, we spent something like three turns actually getting our asses over to Alpha-6.\n\nSo the Evangelions arrive in a glorious line at the edge of the battlefield, watching huge numbers of tanks and VTOLs ineffectually piddle away their ammunition at this massive armored thing that didn't seem to care much. We were ordered to engage, and by this point Speedwagon had somehow bargained his way back into the command bridge to the collective disdain of the pilots. Aiden apparently lowered the confidence of the table by asking if the VTOLs and tanks were drones, which caused an uncomfortable silence in the bridge as the staff mulled over whether or not they were willing to tell their newest child soldiers about the massive body count being wracked up while they briskly marched towards the giant alien bug. They wound up not saying anything. No, we were saving the trauma for later.\n\nAnyhow, four Evas engaged the Angel. Four attacks were launched. Four attacks did fuck-all. As I would later learn, the DM had underestimated the armour an angel would get in the 2.5 DM's kit, and thus buffed the armour to hell. The end result was that nothing we had could realistically scratch this thing. The DM had also made the Angel's behavior entirely random, and he'd dedicated a massive table to decide what it would do. So he rolled on the table, and Alpha-6 retaliated, choosing the closest target to whale on. This turned out to be Aiden. Thankfully, Eva-05 was just as heavily armored as it looked, so the Angel didn't do too much damage either.\n\nWe spent ten turns sinking attacks into this thing, barely scratching the surface of what I described in my notes as an armored god. The thing's random behavior prevented it from doing too much damage to any of us in particular, but that didn't matter. In a handful of turns, the nuke was gonna be brought in and the Norfolk Islands would be well and truly destroyed.\n\nThis is the point where Aiden had the brilliant idea to crawl into the Angel's mouth.\n\nTurns out, this is what the GM had intended us to do the entire time. He'd planned on us trying to take this thing down from the inside, where it wouldn't have any armor. Another player helped wrench open the thing's jaw, and I spent my last few turns worth of power to force my forty-foot mech into Alpha-6's throat. Unit-05 had its legs virtually bitten off, and the umbilical that fed me power was severed.\n\nHaving no other recourse, I rolled to go berserk. Berserking, for those not in the know, is a way of making an Evangelion go without power. You effectively fall into the Frenzied State from Dark Heresy, attacking the Angel first and anything else for 1d5 rounds until the Eva finally calms down. Aiden was not the right class to fully take advantage of berserking, but she could still do it and it would solve her energy problem. Plus, when you're looking down the esophagus of a giant alien shrimp while it chews on your legs, there's probably no better state of mind to be in. I succeeded my roll, and began to RIP AND TEAR my way around the thing's mouth. Outside, the other three Evas finally run out of power.\n\nThen, because we've run out of time and the UN wants to cut their losses, the nuke drops.\n\nNow, for those who know Evangelion, all Evas and all Angels have something called an AT Field. Without going into series-specific terminology, AT Fields are effectively forcefields that practically no-sell any weapon short of a physics-wrecking energy rifle. In the game, this Field supplemented the armour of the Evas and Angels, and had to be lowered by other fields in order for them to actually be hurt. It's one of the reasons that the governments of the world don't simply try to nuke Angels, because their fields will endure the blast. There are actually mechanics for being hit with a nuke, and if you have an AT Field spread the damage is almost manageable. Anything that doesn't have an AT Field? 50 energy damage. In a system where the highest HP total is likely to be 10.\n\nNorfolk is obliterated. Those who weren't evacuated quickly enough are smashed into their component atoms. Alpha-6 fries, as do the three powerless Evangelions outside of it. Even tucked away inside the Angel's mouth with her field spread, Aiden takes enough damage to cripple her mech. The fight is over, and while Alpha-6's randomly-determined rampage was halted the Evangelion project had suffered its first failure.\n\nThus ends the first session. Speedwagon managed to talk the base commander into not utterly sinking his career (somehow) and left the bridge to head home. Aiden is returned to the shared apartment to finally begin moving in, while the rest of the pilots are shuttled to the hospital to deal with the physical and mental strain. I'm left feeling equal parts excited, disappointed, and hyped for the next session. Little did I know what I was getting in to.",

        "text": "So I did a one off session today with a couple of friends..\n\nOur goal was to guard and take a caravan of supplies to a town by the name of Phandalin. The guy who was paying us was a stocky dwarf who had to leave ahead of time to 'take care of business'. We were suspicious but just went with it.\nThe people in this Tale are: \nCheckavoc, the brother of the person who hired us. The runt of the litter and not very well liked by the rest of his family. He has strange fascinations... Like wanting to set everything on fire.\n\nMithrin, A Drow Ranger who's goal was to remove the social stereotype surrounding him and his people. He believed that people pigeon-hole the Drow race into a negative aspect before seeing who they really are. Also played the Kazoo, as it brought up memories of who he loved.\n\nInil, a high elf wizard. Terrible with people and basically read and prayed the whole time. Had good stats but managed to miss almost every spell...\n\nAnd me, Dain Ironfist, a dwarf who wishes to build a smithy in Phandalin and the strongest and toughest of the lot..\n\nIt started after we introduced ourselves to each other and pulled the caravan to a stop when we found two dead horses 50 feet in front of us... Too make a long story somewhat shorter I basically inched up to the horses with my shield drawn.. Surprise the goblins rolled a Nat 20 on sneak and took us by surprise. \n\nStraight away I took 6 health from an arrow to slightly below the knee... Don't worry I'm still an adventurer. The Drow ranger managed to hit a goblin in a bush with an arrow which disgruntled the little creature. He managed to run 60 feet next turn to escape. Checkavoc through a hand axe and missed, also while attempting to light a bush on fire that two goblins were hiding in. Inil missed frost bolt... Twice. And Mithrin missed a point blank goblin with his long bow. \"Warning shot!\" He shouted at the creature who simply stuck his tongue out at him. I capitalised on this slight distraction by shield bashing the goblin with a 17 on athletics (+5 bringing it in boys!). The goblin quickly recovered and scrambled back to its feet, and was promptly kicked in the face by the ranger. I then pulverised it with my 'sharpened war hammer' (don't ask) with a max damage hit. \n\nThen our Mage, Inil said fuck it and used magic missiles... Which was 3d6 with advantage. The goblin didn't survive. A small goblin cried out in dismay \"No! Not bobby!\" And promptly shanked Checkavoc the dwarf in the back. Checkavoc responded by rolling a Nat 20 and biffing him up with a war hammer. All the while the Drow was playing the kazoo for atmosphere. \n\nWe chose to hide our wagon in some thickets and make chase after the injured goblin. Along the way the GM made Checkavoc roll perception check. He rolled a 1. The floor gave way beneath him... He rolled a Nat 20 on Dex save. We came to the end of a track which opened out to an area with a cave entrance. Walled on both sides by thickets. A river came out of the cave, on one side was a dry path, on the other was us. The Drow rolled an 18 on perception and noticed two goblins in the dense thicket on the other side of the stream. Checkavoc wanted to light them on fire, but instead through another hand axe at them. And missed. Inil responded by accidentally blasting them with Max damage fire. This set the thickets and the hand axe on fire. The goblins were never seen again. Checkavoc wanted to smoke out the cave with the thicket fire, but due to it being magic of origin, it quickly went out. We temporarily discussed burning our rope, which was made out of hemp, to smoke out the cave but chose not to and entered the cave. Except Checkavoc, who stayed behind to gather thickets.\n\nI, Dain, had a run in with some wolves and was rendered unconscious, while Ilin and Mithrin dealt with the wolves, Checkavoc remained outside to pick thickets. Eventually since both the Drow and the Mage both rolled a 2, and a 3 respectively, Checkavoc had to come to stabilise me then went back to picking thickets. But oh no! His thickets caught fire spontaneously while he was gone! Looks like he had to start from scratch. After about an hour of collecting thickets he and the others went further up the cave until they came upon a wooden bridge above them. Can you guess what Checkavoc wanted to do? Set it on fire. Meanwhile I was downstream (remember this cave has a nice 2 feet deep stream running through it) bathing myself. Checkavoc set his bundle of thickets down and prepared to ignite the bridge, but suddenly the hear a rushing water noise. They all roll Dex saves.. And get decent scores. The three adventurers scatter into various crevices to avoid water just as a massive wave comes downstream, but for poor Dain who is currently bathing, he rolled a 2. The wave sweeps him away and deposits him outside the cave minus a health point.\n\nAnd poor Checkavoc! His thickets had been washed away too! ...\n\nAnd the icing on the cake, he became unconscious several minutes later when he encounter trouble climbing a semi steep slope.\n\nThe reason those rabid wolves got to me earlier was because I relied upon a specific person who was busy PICKING THICKETS.",

        "text": "So, this is my first time writing up a story; however, the encounter we had at our gaming session last night was too good to pass up. It had drama, it had finesse, it had Satyrs which... in the course of playing we found out are constantly... ahem... aroused according to popular mythology. So, I will recount the tale to the best of my ability, but I will start with the actors in this little play.\n\n**King Owlbear**: A Monk of the way of the open hand. He is an entertainer by trade, and his Monastic tradition is more akin to a stable of Face Pro Wrestlers. Typically he wears a mask when he is working the crowds, but in a fight he normally goes without.\n\n**Eleanora**: A no nonsense elf Ranger who really does not like King Owlbear and on the surface says she wants to rid the world of evil; however, is actually kind of a klepto and loves money more than anything else.\n\n**Quill**: A soft spoken Dragonborn Fighter who has gone down the path to being a Fighter with a penchant for some spells. His spells are not as effective as him hitting stuff with swords, which he seems to forget constantly.\n\n**Morthos** A lecherous skirt-chasing Tiefling Warlock. Probably one of the deadliest magic users in the party, but because he has to make everything an innuendo and is going after women he loses focus very easily. \n\n**Varicks** A snarky Half-Elf Sorcerer, constantly making jabs at the rest of the party. His spells are about 75% as effective as Morthos'; however, his use of Shatter has constantly gotten the party out of a pinch.\n\n**Nyx** A gnome Rogue, she is a pint-sized powerhouse and terrifying in combat as she laughs at her enemies. She is pretty secretive, but enjoys the heat of battle.\n\n**Teal** Finally, and last but certainly not least, Half-Orc barbarian. A walking cliche of rage and anger but also super nice. She loves taunting and giving Morthos and King Owlbear crap.\n\n\nThis story is actually in the middle of our story. The party was tasked by the herbalist of a nearby city to find the Witch's Bowl. Which is essentially an area where Druids would conduct a yearly ceremony/festival. There was said to be something priceless that the herbalist could use for her own concoctions.\n\nWe made it to the edge of what appeared to be the Witch's Bowl, a small abandoned village in the middle of some creepy woods. King Owlbear, Nyx, and Eleanora were trying to sneak out to the edge to get a better vantage point; however, they were apparently wearing clogs and tripping over everything. King Owlbear decided that he would go out in the middle of town to see if he could find anything living. As he made his way down the path to almost the central area, the other party members were attempting to make a plan that was less foolhardy.\n\nEleanora tried to get back to the group, but managed to run afoul of a raging Centaur who massacred her with his mighty lance. She was not in good shape at the time and was caught alone by the rampaging half-human hybrid. Meanwhile, Owlbear was yelling out to anyone within earshot, \"What ho, is there no one to entertain in this town!?\" Which caused a barrage of five arrows to loose and fly his way, two managed to miss, he caught two, and one finally hit its mark causing a slight wound.\n\nAt the sound of the word \"Ho\" Morthos sprang to action and ran towards the village. Simply to be distracted by a damsel in distress Eleanora, fighting the Centaur. Blasting the Centaur who was between him and her with an eldritch blast. The rest of the party followed suit, with Eleanora getting a good shot in with her bow. In the end the Centaur managed to get a blow that KO'd her and put her into a critical state.\n\nAt this time, King Owlbear got shot with five more arrows, two more going wild, two more caught, and another finding purchase in his torso. He managed to run into the nearest building and take cover, finding it completely empty. The Satyrs that fired at him were closing in, so he managed to take a potion.\n\nBack with the Centaurs, another showed up to the party and was engaged with Teal the Half-Orc who was raging and holding her own while Nyx was taking pot shots with a short bow. Morthos ran to get to Eleanora to stabilize her, but was hit by the Centaur near her with a lance. He screamed, \"F*** you!\" as he used rebuke which incinerated the Centaur. Half the party ran into town to work on the group of Satyrs while Morthos healed Eleanora.\n\nThe Satyrs grouped up near the entrance of the house King Owlbear ducked into. Two entered but couldn't find him in the first room and three stayed out to fight Quill and Varicks. Spells and swords were slung around but the Satyrs proved vicious. Teal and Nyx managed to finish off the last centaur, and saw that Varicks and Quill were engaging the satyrs too far from where they were at currently. So, Teal decided to pick up the gnome and create a gnome fast-ball special that rocketed towards the weakest Satyr. Slashing his throat, the little Gnome executed a perfect backflip off the dead Satyr and kicked another one in the head that was close by. The cheeky Satyr missed her with its attack and she finished it with a quick castration.\n\nIn the house King Owlbear failed at being stealthy in the other room, and because of this decided to run back into the room with the two remaining Satyrs and perform an RKO out of no-where on the closest one, while donkey kicking the other into the far while, and finally punching the one he attempted (but failed) to RKO in the face. They had a bit of a back and forth, but neither side was getting injured too badly until Morthos blasted the Satyr that had been sent to the far wall. King Owlbear fumbled with his short sword and couldn't unsheath it and missed with a punch. The Satyr laughed and then dropped his sword. King Owlbear finished this one off with a sword slash and a couple quick punches to the face.\n\nFinally, the party was victorious and they could move further into the Witch's Bowl. It was a hard fought battle, but entertaining nonetheless. I hope you fine readers enjoy, again this is my first time so I am expecting to be eviscerated soundly for my depiction of events. Cheers!

        "text": "Just finished my Pokemon Sun Nuzlocke Run, which for those of you who don't know is basically Pokemon with Permadeath where you can only catch the first 'Mon you find in an area. \n\nI'm going to tell you a tale from that run now, the tale of Coopler.\n\nMother\n\nFucking\n\nCoopler.\n\n\nCoopler and I began our professional relationship in a knee-high patch of grass residing within the first real city of the game. I waded in only to find this adorable, rainbow colored lump of slime waiting for me. A chirpily excited Alola Grimer. We had a rocky relationship at first, with me mostly focusing my attention on the grassy owl who's name I forgot, but early on I discovered something tremendous about Coopler.\n\nHis typing is fiiiiiiiiiine. In his Alola form, Coopler was Poison/Dark, which is phenomenal in that both types cover eachother's weaknesses leaving his only vulnerability as the uncommon and easily avoidable Ground. Now, not only was Cooper perfectly typed for a challenging run, he was incredibly bulky by nature, leading my team both in hitpoints and noxious odors. For as bulky as he was, Coopler also hit like a god damn truck full of anchors, learning incredibly powerful STAB moves early on.\n\nThroughout my adventure, my team grew and changed, adapting to secure their own safety and coverage, and eventually I found a cool new fire/poison lizard and was forced to bench Coopler for a bit. It honestly felt sort of scummy at that point, but I reasoned with myself that Coopler didn't care, Coopler just wants what's best for the team, Coopler is a greater man than any one of us. It was with that rationale that I trained my Fire Lizard up, trying to evolve him so that one day he could be a fraction of the man Coopler wished him to be. In my haste to recover the poison-colored hole left in both my heart and my team comp, I learned of a terrible truth.\n\nMales of the fire lizard species can't evolve.\n\nI had spent hours of real world time training this shithead with no potential while Coopler was chilling in a storage unit.\n\nGodammit.\n\nI ran back to the center, withdrew Coopler the Motherfucker, and vowed never to bench him again. I used up all of my Rare Candies in order to make up for his lack of experience, and managed to evolve him right then and there to a Muk in a scene so cheesily coincidental that it could have its own episode of the cartoon.\n\nFrom then on, Coopler and I were inseperable, beating down island trials and criminal syndicates like all eleven year olds were born to do, and while I didn't use Coopler as often as I once had, he was always there as the rock of the team, ready to take a hit when need be. With this marvelous color shifting ever-radiant mound of sludge in tow, I set my sights on the final prize;\n\nThe Elite 4.\n\nIn retrospect, I was somewhat under leveled for a Nuzlocke (only 10~15 levels above the enemy), but grinding near the end is a massive chore of sifting through waves and waves of Snowrunts who only doll out a minuscule parcel of experience. I was confident in my team and ready for a challenge, the two worse things you can be in a Nuzlocke Run.\n\nThe First of the four is a snitch, he exclusively uses Fighting Types so I setup my Myne the Pelipper (the run's other surprise MVP) who blasts through his lineup with his unrelenting hurricanes.\n\nThe Second of the four isn't a problem, she uses Rock types and leads with a Relicanth who doesn't hit very hard, so I manage to get my Clefable setup with +6 to both defenses and tore through her entire team in a thunderous vortex of pink fluffiness.\n\nThe Third of the four is slightly more challenging, utilizing Ghost types and their renown trickiness. I manage to clutch victory with some painful yet non-fatal wounds, using Coopler's crunches of doom and resistance to my enemy's every attack to pull it out in the end.\n\nThe Fourth of the Four used Flying types, and, unlike the rest of the group, wasn't a helpful NPC from earlier in the game's storyline. She was just some lady with a golfclub, weird. Her team wore me down a bit, but I managed to wear her down to the point where most of my guys were near max health and she was on her final bird. I, feeling confident in Coopler's famous tankiness, sent him out to finish the job, when she revealed her hidden technique.\n\nYou see, throughout the game you have access to this thing called \"Z\" move, which basically turns one of your Pokemon's moves into an elemental Hyper beam which you can only use once per battle. Up to this point, only a handful of enemies had used their own, and they hadn't been very effective.\n\nUntil now, that is.\n\nThis smug ass lady and her smug ass Toucan go through their absurdly elaborate choreography while I'm crossing my fingers with the force of a thousand fifth graders waiting to see if school had been closed after an inch of snowfall for Coopler to take the hit.\n\nOf course, as any disgruntled school-ridden child will tell you, crossing your fingers only gets you so far.\n\nCoopler's hit points plummeted, the bar racing from green to red as my heart raced from healthy to holy-shit-due-see-a-doctor only for us both to come to a sudden, abrupt stop (I didn't die tho it's just a videogame). And in one fell swoop, that adorable mound of sludge I met twenty minutes into my adventure was gone.\n\nDead from a god damn bird attack.\n\nI swatted that bird down with the fury of a thousand gunk shots and escaped that horrid chamber of suffering cradling the now deceased Coopler's great ball in my arms.\n\nAfter the battle, as I was tending to the rest of my team's wounds, I found myself incredibly tempted to just use a Max Revive and pretend that this never happened. I didn't have to tell anyone, this was a private run, I could tell all of my friends that I beat my Sun Nuzlocke and only suffered a single casualty!\n\nBut that's not what Coopler stood for.\n\nCoopler was better than us all, he lived and died protecting my team, taking the hits that others could not so that they could live to fight another day while he carried their burdens. Coopler may have lived as a Pokemon, but he died as an idea, dammit. The idea that we're better than we think we are, that, no matter how far we fall, we can always pick ourselves up. That the greatest disappointments can lead to the most wonderful successes.\n\nCoopler might be gone, but he'll never truly die.\n\nRest in piece you magnificent, slimy bastard. Rest in piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso lost a Gyarados but he sucked lmao ",

        "title": "A tale of Oblivions emergent behaviour and how modding made it... odd",
        "author": "Wondrous_Fairy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5eptd5/a_tale_of_oblivions_emergent_behaviour_and_how/",
        "text": "I was inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5enpy6/ahh_skyrim_guards/) to make this post. \n\nBack when Oblivion had enough mods to become a thing, I decided to buy it and quickly played through it and enjoyed myself. It was all cool, but there were so many annoyances. So, the next time I played, I discovered the joy of modding. So I went completely overboard, Obscuros Overhal, Eshmes Boutique, Every damn titty mod you could think of and some other mods like say.. summon a kickass flying dragon as your pet/mount.\n\nAnd this far into the story, I wish to thank each and every one of you modders for your awesome creations. I don't care if you made a horse dick mod or if you made a story campaign, each of your contributions are what makes Oblivion an awesome game. The base game compared to your community creation is pathetic. And that's saying something.\n\nNow, with all that said, I started playing and quickly noticed that I had some rather odd things happening every once in a while. I would sometimes enter a city .. and EVERY single guard would hate me as if I'd killed the Emperor. Of course, that entailed a rather strange way for me to conduct my business as I ended up being afraid of cities after a while. Then I of course stumbled upon the mod for the floating castle and installed that. I finished the quest and started decorating it with my spoils of battle. It was awesome, and really I think every game needs a good trophy room where you can place things. However, one evening, after having battled countless Dremora (in actuality: I put the Yakity Sax on repeat and ran through each instance, no really, that's how you frigging farm those stones) I came back to find that the esteemed guard captain was telling ME I wasn't welcome IN MY OWN GODDAMN HOME. I laughed of course, then I killed him and thought that was the end of that.\n\nBut no.. it wasn't, because he was essential. Now, for those of you two people in the world that still haven't played the newer TES games, that means they will come back to life. ANGRY AS FUCK. \n\nSo he did and I realized that was I some pretty deep shit. However, that nifty flying fortress had a perfect prison for the guy, a generator room of sorts underneath the whole thing. So, being the smug prick that I am, I kited him there and \"killed\" him again, then quickly ran out and abused the console command to lock the door with a level 100 lock. I laughed for a while and then went up the stairs and killed the rest of the guards and threw them over the side of the castle. At this point, I'm feeling pretty awesome about myself.\n\nSo, a few days pass in the game while I do other things.. which brings me to my segue into the next weird encounter, which is short but hilarious. You see, I had this beautiful dragon as my mount and I was all too happy to be the bestest and evilest bitch mage in Oblivion. However, I just can't keep my hands in my pockets so I was in Rindir's Staffs in the Imperial City and I just to grab a piece of loot there. Of course, the psychic guards (which I did NOT install a mod to fix.. for some weird reason) caught me and told me I was a bad bad bitch.\n\nI grinned and nuked a lot of them, casually going out of the city in the meantime. Then I get this idea in my head, choose my spell for summon dragon, turn around and do a bit of roleplay as I say \"HAH guards, you'll NEVER catch me!\" and then I pop my summoning spell.\n\nAbove my head in the sky, there's a portal and my trusty mount shows up... and falls to the ground in a heap of dead dragon. I just looked at it in complete disbelief in a moment, until the guards came and killed me. And really, they earned it. I couldn't run away or do anything, I just had to do it for the awesome roleplay. \n\nThen I reloaded to my earlier save about 30 minutes back and tried to figure out why the hell my dragon was *dead* when I summoned it. Then it dawned on me, I had left the poor thing to fend for itself against some animals before when I was running into a city. \n\nI guess he hadn't made it... and of course, the game being ever so faithful to it's scripting, still summoned it's very dead carcass to \"help\" me. Now, I could have just used the resurrect command, but come on, what cooler spell is there than to summon a completely dead dragon?\n\nAnyway, so with all that said, I ventured back to my castle, happy with my new stuff and still chuckling to myself about my \"newfound spell\" to summon a dead dragon. And I get up there and I'm greeted by ... you guessed it.. the goddamn guard captain.\n\nHe of course tells me I can't be there.. and then he immediately attacks me. I almost die because I'm so shocked that he's out that I'm trying to process it while fighting. It's like one of those horror movies when you lock the evil killer in a room and he's RIGHT BEHIND YOU. I eventually succeed in having him get pushed over the wall and falling to his .. well.. something. \n\nThen I get curious and think to myself \"How the hell did he get out of that room? He couldn't possibly have opened the lock could he?\" So I go down there and look at the door. It still says lock 100. So I use the console command unlock it and go inside.\n\nAnd there he is, the guard captain... I must admit I ran like a bitch out of there and re-locked the door after me, because I was genuinely creeped out. And I guess that if I loaded up the old save, he'd still be in there... forever trapped.. while his identical copy down in the lake under my castle... also swims around forever.\n\nSo that's my rather longwinded tale about how modding made an already cool game even cooler. Also, I hate guards. If you have any stories of your own about weird modding behaviour, I would love to hear them!\n\nEdit: Fixed spelling of a word :D",

The group, lacking a spellcaster, welcomed my Ley Line Walker readily enough.  Not knowing how the group would react to the fact that my Walker was also a Blood Mage I decided to not fully explore that aspect of my character.  I did, however, ask everyone out of character if there would be a problem with this.  Everyone SAID they were fine with it.  \n\nAfter a few sessions we ended up battling a group of bandits that had been terrorizing a small town.  The battle was over before my character could contribute anything, but luckily he was left to help watch over the captives while the faster characters raced after an escaping cyborg.  \n\nThe other PC, a soldier, decided it would be a good idea to try and interrogate the survivors to try and find the location of the bandit base.  The poor soldier wasn't having very much luck with it so I decided this would be a good time to not only intimidate the survivors, but to also gather some supplies for later.\n\n\"My character walks over to one of the dead bodies in view of the captives, reaches down and plucks an eye out of the dead body.\"  I roll an intimidate to the sound of my DM saying \"Oh my god!

The hostages started telling us everything we wanted to know, but I wasn't done.\n\n\"After a few seconds of examining the eye I put it into a pocket in my cloak, and lick the blood from my fingers.\"  At this point one of the other PCs started laughing nervously while the others stopped talking to me...\n\nAfter the scene was finished we are all describing getting back into our jeep and getting ready to leave.  With a snicker I say \"My Walker holds out a jar of strawberry jam and asks if anyone wants some while licking some from his fingers.\"\n\nThe entire party broke out in laughter as they realized my slight of hand trick.

        "text": "During a campaign I was DMing, I had an accident of improbable proportions.  My friends were playing as a Paladin (named Juniper), a Conjurer (named Ares), and a Shieldmaster (named Yol-Mak-Nol) respectively, and they were staying in a city when it was attacked by the followers of a mortal who had recently become a fell god.  The cultists were aiming to conquer the city and kill a local prophetess.  The Shieldmaster found and guarded the prophetess at the inn while the Alchemist and Conjurer went off to assist the city guard.  The leaders of the cultist marauders emerged then - they called themselves the Chaos Triad, a proud warrior, a dark mage, and an assassin, all of whom boasted that they would take this city by force easily.  However, this was not the case.  \n\nJuniper and Ares faced off against the Warrior and Mage, the city guards and cultists standing back to watch them work.  Juniper, skilled in some alchemy, had bombs prepared beforehand, which quickly decimated the Mage, while Ares and his conjurations forced the Warrior to stay at a distance.  Finally, the Warrior reaches Ares, ready to strike him down... When Juniper throws a bomb at him.  I first had him roll a Perception check to see if he noticed it, and he rolled a 20, allowing him to easily catch the bomb long before it blew up and allowing him to throw it anywhere he wanted.  I had the NPC roll an Intelligence roll to see where he'd think to throw it... And he rolled a 1.  The Warrior casually lobs the bomb right over his shoulder, laughing at Juniper for her inept powers.  Unfortunately, the Mage didn't see the Warrior throw the bomb and the Warrior forgot his ally was right behind him, and it exploded on top of the Mage, killing him instantly.  The Warrior then realized he was outnumbered and his troops would lose in this scenario (after another Intelligence check of course) and he retreated.  I had him make a check because of the severity of his injuries, and he rolled another 1.  A scouting party eventually found his looted and bled-out corpse in the nearby woods, his soldiers gone.\n\nDuring all this, the Assassin attacked Yol-Mak-Nol in the inn, trying to kill the prophetess.  Unfortunately for him, the Shieldmaster proved far too tanky to deal with, and he was forced to retreat.  The Assassin rolled a 1 for getting away with his injuries, and was found later on in the rafters of the inn, his wrist slit by his own poisoned knife by accident.\n\nThe best part?  I had built two more future session ideas for that campaign arc around the Chaos Triad coming back and escaping, time and time again.  Unfortunately though, that didn't seem to be Fate's design.  Three 1's will do that to your plans.  The lesson learned?  Don't ever count on your NPCs being competent.  Ever. ",

        "text": "Atheln was the moral center of his party. A group of do-gooders that had criss-crossed Faerun putting down monsters, battling the forces of darkness and generally being big damn heroes. Every step of the way Atheln, Paladin of Justice and servant of Tyr had lead from the front. In battle he unflinchingly faced down every threat and shielded his companions from harm. Out of battle he was a quiet but firm talker, as easily discussing battle plans with the fighter as theology with the cleric.\n\nThe groups latest endeavor was to scour a group of cultists from a mountain hide-out and rescue a series of kidnap victims. They had bypassed major sections of the complex en-route to the main chamber and had succeeded in preventing the ascension of the cult leader to a greater demon form. After a long and brutal battle his body lay on the stone floor, broken by blades and scorched by cleansing fire while all around him were strewn the remnants of his evil plots and the corpses of his most powerful acolytes.\n\nIt was a fight worthy of song and story. But it's not what this story is about.\n\nThey bound their wounds and celebrated their great victory then took stock of their situation. Though their leader was gone the cult was far from extinguished. There could be dozens of them left in the areas they had yet to explore. There was also the question of captives. The cult had kidnapped about a dozen residents from local towns and villages and they had yet to find them. \n\nThere was no question of resting therefore, the group would continue.\n\nThey fought on, and down. In the deepest depths of the catacombs they found the captives. They had fueled the dark magic in the chamber above. They had fueled it with their lives. Men, women and children had been tied to a great shard of crystal their legs and arms had been broken so that they could not flee and then knives used to bleed them and feed the crystal's dark hunger. An examination of their wounds showed that some had suffered for days.\n\nAtheln wept openly and unashamedly, spending over an hour in the chamber, cutting each body down and kneeling over them. He said what prayers he could for their peace, beseeching Tyr to take them beneath his protection and shield them in death as Atheln had failed to do in life. He rose and rejoined the rest who had helped him where they could and left him to pray where they could not.\n\nWith renewed determination they scoured the rest of the complex, slaying a few more and driving the rest before them into a final chamber. There, from behind their barricade they met the party with a flurry of spells and bow fire.\n\nThey pulled back to consider how best to dismantle this last pocket of resistance when from within they heard a voice cry out. \"Parley! We wish parley!\"\n\nAtheln, the hardiest and therefore most likely to survive betrayal, stepped forward to respond. \"You wish to surrender?\"\n\nA cautious figure showed himself, a middle-aged man with the tattos of the cult showing over his face and arms. \"Our leader is dead. Our order shattered. If you let us go we swear that we shall trouble this land no longer.\"\n\nAtheln was silent for a long moment before he nodded slowly. \"What you say is true. You shall trouble this land no longer.\"\n\n\"Then... you accept?\"\n\nAtheln's face was stone, \"You wish for mercy?\"\n\nThe man hesitated, pausing before nodding cautiously, \"We do.\" He cast his eyes over the holy symbols that bedecked Atheln's battle garb. \"We cast ourselves upon Tyr's mercy.\"\n\nAtheln paused at the invocation of his patron's name. He seemed thoughtful. He stared at the man and his tattoos and those of the men with him. \"Tell me, when you bled the men and women from the towns. Did they ask for mercy?\"\n\nThe man paled, fear etching his features but hope evidently lived on. \"We were wrong. We know that now! You have shown us the power of good! The power of the Gods of mercy and peace!\"\n\nAtheln's face hardened, his hand went to his sword. \"Tyr is not the God of mercy and peace. He is the God of justice and I have not yet begun to show you his power.\" \n\nThe cultist spokesperson died to Atheln's first charge. In the ensuing melee he killed four more while his party piled in around him and slew the rest. Not a single cultist lived through the day.\n\nEdit: Words are hard.",

        "text": "This is a few month old story from the very first session of a DnD 5e campaign with all level 1 characters. The story is not a recollection of the session but rather a rewriting of all ~4 hours of it, trying to stay as close to the real events as possible while filling in some gaps. I was going for a very particular style with the text, especially in the combat parts which goes turn by turn. I was sort of trying to split the text into scenes with the titles but I'm not sure how well that worked. Overall this more just me flexing my literary muscles a bit since English isn't my first language nor have I ever written a story with it.\n\n# Prologue\nNortheast of the port town of Breakharbour lies a large forest known as the Nattenwald. It has long been a source of lumber and game for the townsfolk, but recently dangerous creatures had been emerging from the forest to prey upon those who wandered too close. Gwnnar Oximeccä, a half-orc barbarian of the Ursathes tribe, was wandering in the area and had heard rumours of these attacks. He thought he may be of help to the townspeople as he was familiar with the minds and spirits of wild animals, having grown up surrounded up them in the wilderness of the Northlands. One late Mitumnal evening, he entered the town to question the people about the attacks. Many assured him that it would be foolhardy to explore the forest at night. Some spoke of a self-proclaimed monster-hunter who was hired to take care of the problem, but he was never seen again. Gwnnar may not be a smartest person around but he was no fool. He would need help with this.\n\nThe following day the lone barbarian came to the town inn, The Phlegm &amp; Spittle, in search of adventurers who would come with him to the forest. He had come to the right place. Judging from the equipment, nearly everyone in the inn was an adventurer of some sort. From descriptions of the attacks he had gathered the day before, it appeared that nearly all creatures had attacked without provocation or indeed actively hunted people and even adventurers beyond the borders of the forest. This kind of behaviour seemed unnatural to Gwnnar. He suspected that magic had something to do with it. Having no magical qualities himself, Gwnnar went directly to the first wizard he could recognise and asked for his name. The elf introduced himself as Naurdir from Caravell in eastern Taerindor. Those words meant nothing to Gwnnar whose small world ended at the foot of The Spine. Naurdir had only recently arrived at Breakharbour and had not yet heard of the attacks. They discussed the events for a while but the elf did not seem particularly interested in a handful of wild animals. However, once Gwnnar explained his suspicions that magic was involved, Naurdir suddenly found the proposition more appealing.\n\nThe two had not been discussing long when two humans approached the table they sat at. They introduced themselves as Niamh and Santos Silverfinger. They too had been thinking of going to the forest but were reluctant to explore such a dangerous area with just the two of them. Niamh was particularly worried that her bow would not be of much use in the dense forest. When they overheard Naurdir and Gwnnar discussing Nattenwald, they simply had to interrupt and express their wishes to join the group. They spent a third of a day drinking and getting acquainted with each other all the while planning the expedition to the forest.\n\nLater that evening as they left the inn they had barely made it out of the door when a dragonborn stopped them. He hastily introduced himself as Fychan the Small and the polished wooden zither on his side told of his bardic talents. He told them that he had been listening to them in the inn during the day. He too had been following the events surrounding Nattenwald was interested in finding out for himself what was going on in the forest. He had seen a number of adventurers leave the town for the forest over the last few months but none had yet returned. It was clear that he would not survive the trip alone and this seemed like the first group that could actually return alive. The dragonborn asked the them if they would let him join their expedition and reassured that he was as skilled with a sword as he was with a flute. Gwnnar was not very convinced that this small lizard in a patchy robe would be of any use to them but rest concurred that having more people would make the journey safer. The group agreed to meet tomorrow morning at first light on the east side of town to set off on their expedition.\n\n# First Light\nThere was a cool autumn breeze in the air as the sun rose above the horizon. A mismatched group of people slowly gather at the edge of the town. It was common sight to the townsfolk. Another group of adventurers going off to wherever. Though Breakharbour has a port, being so close to Anthea (the capital of Anthos), and being on the wrong side of the Spine, trade was sparse. The town's economy relies almost exclusively on adventurers passing through on their travels, selling off any unwanted items for a handful of coins and resupplying. A group of five began to walk in unison heading northeast where tall trees were just barely visible on the horizon.\n\nThey had only walked for a while across the hilly terrain when Santos spotted something on the shore of a stream flowing northwest. As they approached Gwnnar recognised the altar and wicker wolf head as a shrine of Lupaia, the patron spirit of the Lupaian tribe. He remarked that it was Lupaian territory and that there was nothing unusual about the shrine. Looking back Niamh figured that they were about halfway to the forest. After about 14 kilometres the adventurers had reached the edge of the forest of Nattenwald.\n\n# Crimson\nThe tall trees looked almost ominous as it was difficult to see very deep into the dense and dark forest. Against this backdrop their crimson red welcoming party stood out like a sore thumb. A pair of Bloodhawks on the branches of one of trees. They were clearly just waiting for someone pass by as the birds took flight and started to approach the group as soon as they had stopped. Gwnnar was going to mention that Bloodhawks have been known to attack people if agitated but realised that it would have been redundant as everyone had already drawn their weapons.\n\nFychan was quick and precise with his crossbow, managing to kill one of the hawks with a single bolt before it even reached the group. He sang a short but inspiring tune in the traditional throat-singing style of his people to mark the victory. Naurdir threw a handful of fire at the other Bloodhawk only singing it. Irritated, the hawk swoops down screeching to bite him. Seeing his chance, Santos leaped in with great agility to skewer the bird on his shortsword after it has pecked Naurdir. The battle was over almost as fast as it had started. The party remained silent as they entered the shadowy underbrush. It was just another day in the life of an adventurer.\n\n# Rhythm of the Forest\nDaylight faded quickly in the dense forest briefly after entering and the dampness made the air feel noticeable cooler than on the outside. It was not too difficult to move in the underbrush as there was not much ground vegetation on the forest floor. The group saw weeds, ferns, and the occasional fallen tree here and there. After travelling a while they decided to stop for a moment to spread out and look for trails in the area. Perhaps to find a spot of blood or some evidence of the monster hunter or other adventurers who came before them. Santos and Niamh lit up a torch to aid them in the search as their human eyes were not very useful in the dim lighting of the forest. Soon after Gwnnar spotted another shrine of Lupaia at the base a of tree. It looked much older than the one they had seen before and its base had sunk a third of the way into the muddy ground. Examining the woven wicker wolf head it appeared that it was not made from wood from the forest.\n\nWhilst walking around the forest Gwnnar slipped on a rotten log that was unexpectedly loose. It revealed a swarm of bugs underneath. He would have thought nothing of it expect that they did not begin to scatter after their shelter was rudely stolen from them. In fact the bugs were motionless. Suddenly the entire swarm moved forwards in unison and then stopped. He found this behaviour curious and continued to follow this rhythmic movement of the bugs for a while but soon lost interest.\n\n# Goo\nGwnnar started to hear buzzing that quickly grew louder. He was frantically looking around and soon spotted a red glow amongst the tree trunks. He hollerred for the rest of the group as five large beetles came into view. The bulbous red-glowing underbelly of the beetles was immediately recognisable. The forest became more and more of a puzzle to Gwnnar. Giant Fire Beetles are nocturnal yet it was nearly midday. Even though the canopy above was thick and there wasn't much sunlight, animals are keenly aware of the time of day even with fairly few external cues.\n\nThe group came in running to Gwnnar just as he burst the first beetle with his battleaxe. Goo splashed everywhere and continued to glow a constant dim red colour even outside the beetle's pouch. Naurdir relying on his tried-and-true strategy threw a bolt of fire towards one of the beetles, missing it. Santos decided to put some distance between himself and the group of Fire Beetles, swiftly climbed up a tree and with incredible accuracy shot an arrow right through the head of a beetle.\n\nThe beetles were now all over the group. Niamh was too slow with her bow and fruitlessly swung a shortsword around attempting to hit the beetle that bit her. Two Fire Beetles ganged up on Gwnnar. He let out a loud roar partially out of surprise as the surprisingly strong pincers of a Fire Beetle latched onto his ankle and arm. He swung at the one of them but the strong carapace deflected his axe. Naurdir, who had backed up a bit to avoid any more scratches, firebolted one of the beetles. It let out high-pitched squeal but continued to fight. Santos, who was still up on a tree branch, noticed Niamh's valiant effort with a sword and helped her by pinning the beetle on the ground with an arrow, killing it.\n\nWhile the battle raged on elsewhere Fychan noticed that it had gotten oddly quiet. He had been looking for anything of note along with everyone else but had yet to find anything more interesting than a funny looking mushroom. The forest was indeed dense but if you stood still for a moment and really concentrated, you could just about hear the others walking about and talking. Looking around he could no longer see the torches of either of the humans or hear the others. He began jogging back to where he thought they started the search from. Some moments later a low rumbling roar penetrated the relative silence of the forest and Fychan went into full sprint.\n\nBack at the scene of the battle everything from the trees to the people were covered in glowing red goo. In the midst of it all nobody noticed a wailing sound that was quickly approaching them. Having gathered herself, with a steady hand Niamh ran her sword right through the head of a beetle, managing to kill it without bursting the ooze pouch. There was a brief respite in the battle as the source of the wailing sound emerged from amongst the trees. With a wild look on his face a small green dragonborn bard sprinted towards a Fire Beetle screaming like a Banshee holding a longsword above his head with both hands. In great big arc he swung it at the final beetle burying the sword deep in the muddy ground beside it with a solid thunk. Fychan let out a string of vivid expletives in draconic as Gwnnar neatly cleaved the last beetle in half right in front of his face, covering Fychan in goo.\n\nNattenwald was quiet again after the battle as everyone cleaned off Fire Beetle muck from their equipment and bodies. Santos descended down from the tree squeaky clean with a smirk on his face. Fychan not liking the look on his face, flung some goo on him as well. Gwnnar figured that the glands that excrete the goo might be worth something back in town and proceeded to extract two intact ones from one of the corpses. Fychan and Santos followed suit.\n\n# A Stone Among the Trees\nThe group continued to travel deeper into the forest in a northeasterly direction when they came across a cocoon hanging on a branch high up in the trees. Judging the shape of the cocoon Niamh mentioned that it was probably a boar of some kind. Out of curiosity or perhaps to investigate it further Naurdir used his magic to disturb the cocoon to detach it from the branch making it fall down and burst open. The immediate foul smell of rotting flesh was followed by hundreds of tiny spiders flowing out of the cocoon crawling in unison towards southeast. Nobody was keen to investigate a rotting corpse so the group continued on.\n\nA bit past midday they felt a short tremor in the ground. It lasted for a few seconds and was far stronger than just a falling tree. It hardly made any sound. The group stopped for a moment to discuss the event when Naurdir spotted a large standing stone in the distance. They sent Niamh to investigate it closer as she was skilled in moving quietly in a forest. It wouldn't be wise to brashly move in in case something large was walking around.\n\nNiamh quietly sneaked towards the large stone and soon came to a clearing. Even before she reached the clearing she began to feel slight vibrations in the air. In fact as she started to think about it, she had felt similar vibrations the entire time she had been in the forest but they had been barely noticeable, easily dismissed as a trick of the mind. But here the vibrations were definitely real. The standing stone Naurdir saw was a part of a larger structure of five standing stones in a circular formation. They were massive. Nearly ten times her height and at least twice the width of her with arms wide open. On the opposite side of the clearing two of the stones had a third stone slab on top forming an archway. Inspecting the stones closer she noticed that although their form was fairly natural, their surface was covered in intricate carvings. Shallow grooves forming swirls and circles. Curiously the grooves seemed to have a reddish oil-like substance in them that was still wet.\n\nIn the centre of the circle was a tree far larger than anything else in the forest. It looked nothing like the other trees with its thick twisting roots partially above ground and thick branches reaching out, covering nearly the entire clearing. She could not see the top through the canopy and what little light got through the holes in it. At the base of this massive tree a deer had been killed and staked to the trunk. Its chest had been torn and splayed open with its intestines all over the ground in front of it. She decided it would best to return back to the group and maybe investigate the area again with more people. The clearing seemed safe enough, she had not seen or heard a single animal and certainly nothing that would cause tremors, but the vibrations were making her feel uneasy.\n\nThe others had been nervously observing Niamh creep up on the standing stone, weapons out and ready to rush in at the slightest hint of trouble. They relaxed a little when they saw her casually walking back through the forest. She explained to the them what she had seen at the clearing. Gwnnar was certain it was something of the magical sort. Probably druids. His tribe had had a druid or two over the years and they had always painted swirls and other strange lines on everything, he commented.\n\n# Acid\nNiamh was reluctant to go back but the rest unanimously agreed that the clearing should be investigated further. Although Niamh assured them that there were no creatures ahead they decided to approach the circle carefully. Gwnnar found the notion silly. If something or someone was at the clearing they would have certainly seen and heard such a large group of people nearby in the quiet forest. What was the point of creeping about when there were battles to be had. But he and Niamh humoured the rest of the group and slowly walked a little bit behind them.\n\nWithout warning the ground begins to rumble and in front of them a circular patch of ground sank before bursting open with surprising force flinging dirt, stones, and branches everywhere. A large brown insect leapt out of the ground along with the dirt landing on top of Santos. With remarkable speed Niamh nocked and shot an arrow as if by reflex while Naurdir simultaneously threw a fistful of fire at it both just barely missing the creature. The Ankheg looked like something between an ant and a spider. Its prominent elongated abdomen was covered in shiny carapace plates ending in nasty looking deep red spikes. Its back was covered with a wide flat shell that was pointy on the edges and the six striped brown furry legs were much like those of a spider, except for the thick black hook-like claw on the end of them. Its head had long antennae and three sets of pincers, two of which were significantly smaller obviously dedicated to simply eating. However the third set of pincers were easily longer than a mans arm, sparsely serrated and looked about as sharp as any blade. This thing had sabres for mandibles.\n\nThe two pitch black eyes were fixed on Santos as it clutched him with its sabre-like mandibles. He had no time to react having been knocked down by the creature landing on him. The Ankheg lift him up to the air and sprayed acid on him from its mouth. The mandibles were crushing his chest and he feared if it squeezed any harder he would be cut cleanly in half. Blood was rushing in his ears and his consciousness faded as he was unable to breathe. Gwnnar pulled a javelin from his back and hurled it at the Ankheg, burying it deep into its abdomen. The creature did not even react to it. Fychan yells something incomprehensible at the Ankheg. Naurdir, noticing Santos' unconscious body flopping in the insect's jaws, calls upon his healing magics to revive him. Santos, who still barely able to breathe, quietly squirmed and whacked at the joint of one of the mandibles with his shortsword but only managed to get half way through. Niamh fired another arrow at it but if a thick javelin sticking out of its abdomen did not make the creature recoil, an arrow by comparison might as well have been a pine needle.\n\nNaurdir attempted to coax the Ankheg to drop Santos by throwing a firebolt at its face, at the risk of hitting him, but he missed again. The Ankheg began to scurry between the trees tossing Santos around breaking a number of his ribs and spraying acid on the tree trunks, miraculously missing Santos. Gwnnar tried to throw another javelin at it but missed the moving target by a large margin. Fychan, however, had been ready and waiting for an opening when he finally got it. A single slash of his longsword was all it took to cut off one the Ankheg's slender legs as it ran by him. He began chanting a song of battle to inspire the group. The Ankheg was momentarily distracted by the loss of one its legs and perhaps by the strange sounds Fychan was making which gave Santos just enough time to shove his sword up the creature's neck and into its head. The Ankheg immediately released him, began convulsing, and spraying acid uncontrollably before falling on the ground, forcing Santos' sword completely through its head.\n\nWhile Naurdir was treating Santos' wounds, Fychan pointed out that the insect's carapace might be worth a few gold pieces back in town. Gwnnar eyed up the corpse, grabbed a small handaxe from his belt, skillfully extracted a sizeable thick piece of the creature's shell, and passed it to him. Gwnnar had little use for coins. He was perfectly happy with his old but trusty equipment and lived off the land unlike his fellow adventurers. He left to search for his javelin that had missed. Fychan was already cleaning his sword when he suddenly stopped and stared at the corpse laying on the ground with squinted eyes. Suddenly he grabbed his longsword with both hands, brought it up high, and swung it down at the Ankheg's neck, decapitating it. Niamh enquired as to what might he be doing. He said that he simply wanted a trophy from the battle pointing at the impressive pincers on it. It would surely look intimidating on a wall somewhere. Gwnnar returned to Fychan attaching the Ankheg's head to his backpack and carefully cleaning its blade-like pincers when he chortled loudly and commented whether squashing an insect had finally awakened a yearning for battle in the bard.\n\n# Vibrations in the Weave\nSantos was getting back on his feet when Naurdir warned him to take it slow. He did what the could to stop any bleeding and close any external wounds he could find but he was no healer. Santos would be not be fighting condition for day or two if not longer. Gwnnar asked if they were still going to try to sneak to the standing stones while smirking.\n\nThey had barely moved from the Ankheg's corpse that was slowly being corroded by its own acid towards the stones when Naurdir exclaimed that it was a ritual site. He could feel the magic flowing from it as they approached the site. Niamh was hesitant to come closer than the edge of the clearing. Naurdir continued to explain how he had felt a strong source of magic in the forest the moment they had entered but was unsure about the feeling, as things tended to be with magic. Certain forests were inherently magical and including magical creatures in the mix, it could have been anything. But now he was certain. He described how he could feel strong vibrations from the standing stone as he lay his hand on its surface. Gwnnar was poking at the stone saying it was being perfectly still. The stones were sending vibrations through the magical weave Naurdir corrected himself commenting on Gwnnar's complete lack of magical ability.\n\nNaurdir was fascinated by the standing stones. The vibrations were not as continuous as he had felt earlier in the forest. There was a certain rhythm to them. A pulse. It's strength was nearly unbearable right next to the surface of stone. A cold dark red liquid slowly began to flow over the hand he held to the stone. Curiously it seemed to follow the pattern of the grooves underneath his hand even flowing upwards at times. He withdrew his hand and cleaned the substance off. It was most likely blood judging by the colour. The pattern he had smeared off the surface was already slowly repairing itself.\n\nThe rest walked towards the central tree. Fychan and Santos decided to avoid the rotting deer corpse and the repulsive smell surrounding it and instead investigated the pool of water at the base of the tree. From further away it looked like a round dark hole in the ground but at its edge the reflection of the canopy and bits of bright blue sky above were visible the surface of the eerily still water. The thick serpentine roots of the massive tree reached into the pool but quickly disappeared from view in the murky water. Santos cupped his hands together and scooped up a little water. It had a slight red tinge to it and was quite muddy as he had expected but it was otherwise rather unremarkable.\n\nNow closer to the tree even Gwnnar began to physically feel the vibrations in the air. They were making him most uncomfortable and giving him a headache on top of it. Seemingly unbothered by the smell of decaying flesh, he was drawn to the animal staked to the tree. He had never seen anything like it. At first glance it looked like a stag of some sort but it also had the horns of a ram in addition to its antlers. It also had long fangs protruding from its mouth, something usually seen in carnivores. Its chest was torn open and the body cavity of the creature was empty. Its intestines were strewn all over the ground in front of it. Apart from that the creature appeared unharmed. Gwnnar did not know why this animal had been killed but he though it was a tremendous waste. His tribe had valued the life of all nature's creatures greatly. No life was ended without purpose and every little bit of a creature was used. Before his eyes lay an insult towards nature itself. He began to pull out the metal stakes that were run through the stag's legs into the tree.\n\nNaurdir was sitting on a log, engrossed in writing notes into a little book when the vibrations suddenly stopped. The forest was now perfectly silent both in the physical and the magical realm. He nearly jumped up and impetuously asked what had happened. He looked towards the centre of the circle and saw Gwnnar holding four stakes and the stag's corpse laying on the ground. Naurdir let out a frustrated sigh. He walked towards one of the stones and wiped off some of the blood to confirm his theory. He stared intensely at the smudged area for a while and nodded slightly when the blood stayed still. He continued to write a few more lines into his book when Gwnnar came to him and proclaimed that his headache had stopped with a smile on his face. Naurdir glared at him. He told the rest that of the group that he was leaving as there was nothing interesting in there any more. The rest agreed. Santos said that he did not find a deer corpse that interesting in the first place.\n\n# Epilogue\nA light rain began to fall as a group of five adventurers were walking through the forest of Nattenwald. The cheerful tone they were chatting in contrasted slightly with their battle worn look. Their equipment were stained with all kinds of fluids, some of the stains were even glowing slightly, and of them was carrying pieces of some creature they must have slain. The forest was slowly coming back to life. Some early birds were already back chirping their songs. A giant centipede as thick as a man raced past the group from behind and with reflexes honed over years of battle they had their weapons ready in the blink of an eye, but the insect far more interested in finding something a little smaller to eat and ignored these strange two-footed creatures. The adventurers relaxed a little when they came to the edge of the forest where two Bloodhawk corpses lay on the ground. They continued onwards to the southeast where the rooftops of Breakharbour were a golden yellow colour in the evening sun.",

Our orders were to stay there, but our leader Seifer decides to push the offensive and orders us to follow.

        "text": "       **Spoiler Alert: Contains minor spoilers for Lost Mines of Phandelver**\n\n   I've been running the Lost Mines of Phandelver for 5E with six players, and half the group decided to to go kill some orcs for money. The other players wanted their characters to stay back in town to do stuff like crafting, so I had them them play out some Orc NPCs. (They seemed to enjoy it btw; I recommend throwing in this type of thing if you get the opportunity.) One of them played the head Orc, another played the second in command, and the last guy voiced the big fearsome ogre.\n\n   First, they send the dwarven cleric to the front of the cave mouth, and he asks the lone sentry: \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?!\"  The sentry is confused and yells back into the cave that a short hairy man is asking about beef. The Orc players are in another room deciding how to role play, and they shout back: \"We don't have any spare beef! Tell him to go away!\" \n\n   The dwarf goes back to the treeline, and the \"human\" warlock comes sauntering up next. \"Yo, I hear you guys have some free beef,\" he says. At this point, the orc chieftain and his second come out of the cave to see what's going on. The chieftain takes issue with being pestered for free food, and decides to exercise his blood lust by slicing a nice gash into the warlock's leg. \"Bob\" the warlock starts to protest, but then the hulking, lumbering ogre emerges from the cave. It speaks with a voice like the yellow guy from Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared,and he says: \"No, no, boss. Yous gots to boil 'em up, and THEN slice 'em. I'll get 'im over the fire, jus' a minute.\"\n \n  The ogre grabs Bob in a bear hug, and I ask Bob's player if he wants to resist the grapple. He says \"nah, I'm gonna see how this plays out.\"  Meanwhile, our elven druid, Thia, hits the orc chieftain with a bow shot from the treeline. Outraged, he charges towards the treeline and commands the orcs inside the cave to follow him. Ryuko the dwarf takes what time he has to summon his spiritual weapon, while Thia turns into a bear. It's initiative! \n\n  Meanwhile inside the cave, the ogre carries Bob towards the fire. Bob uses his telepathy and a bit of charm to instill grief, guilt, and empathy into the Ogre. The ogre says \"Wha' is this feeling? Feels like... guilt.\" He proceeds to bash his head against the wall, putting another round between Bob and assured death. \n  Outside the cave, the PCs are having a rough start. The orc chieftain gets a good hit on Ryuko while his second keeps the spiritual weapon at bay, and the fearsome guiding bolt misses its target by a mile. The bear can't land any good attacks, and five more orcs arrive at the end of the round.\n\n  Meanwhile, the ogre has regained its composure and become rather irritated with Bob. It puts him by the fire and pins him down with a large boulder. Then it says \"you seem like you need a good smashing! Lemme go get my smashing stick.\" The ogre goes off to get said stick, and Bob's death is kept away for a little while longer. \n  Back at the treeline, the battle fiercely continues. Some orcs are circling the chieftain to protect him, while others are staving off the bear. Ryudo hits one with guiding bolt, and it explodes in a brilliant flash of radiance. He sends his spirit weapon through the defensive gap, and the orc chieftain howls in pain, throwing a projectile of his own in retaliation. The bear manages to make some thin-sliced orc jerky in the meantime.\n\n  The ogre finds his big stick, but on his way back is met with an unexpected figure: his mother! \"Mum? I thought you were dead?!\" His mother explains that she came back from the dead because she's disappointed at the ogre's choice to eat humans, and ogre, enraged that his mother is interfering with his lifestyle choices, begins beating her to death. (Perhaps for the second time.)\n  At this point, the battle outside wraps up. One orc is torn into bites sized pieces by the the big fearsome bear, and the chieftain is incinerated in a brilliant flash of radiant energy after his second dove in front of the spirit weapon. The three or four remaining orcs, after realizing that the leadership is dead, turn back the cave and hear the wild, frenzied screaming of the ogre. They promptly book it out of there. \n     \n  After beating to death the illusory incarnation of his mother, the ogre returns to his boulder  and campfire setup to find that Bob has magically disguised himself as an orc. He says (in common) \"Oh, thank goodness you're here! That pesky human got out and put me under here! I think he ran off towards the treeline!\" *points to where the other PCs are* The ogre starts pounding his chest in anger and runs full speed towards the trees while crying out maniacally. One of the other players laughs and says \"You forgot to ask him to free you.\" Bob's player says he didn't forget.\n  Thia has just turned back into an elf when she and Ryuko see the massive ogre barreling towards them. Desperately, they hit it with everything they have. Spiritual weapon, arrows, a flaming sphere, and two guiding bolts. Just as the ogre prepares to squash the already injured elven druid, he falls to the ground under the weight of his injuries. As the cracks in his skin begin to glow with radiance, he looks to the sky one final time. \n\n     \"But mum,\" he says. \"I'm still 'ungry.\"\n      \n     ",

        "text": "(x-posted from r/WoW)\n\nI’m new to reddit, but this story is old. It is my best WoW story I have after 12 off-and-on years of playing. \n\nI want to take you back to The Burning Crusade era. It was mid-late xpac and Black Temple was out. If you didn’t play then it may be difficult to understand the gear disparities that would develop between your more casual players and the hardcore – there was only so much you could do on your own or in small groups. In its most extreme circumstances it could create a circumstance such as this one.\n\nThis is the story of the Warsong Gulch Raid Boss.\n\nIt was Warsong Gluch bonus weekend, and myself and my random server compatriots (Shadow Council for life) started the rituals of buffing and so forth. A dwarf Paladin named Dyno (or something close) volunteered to be the flag carrier and it was agreed. The gates raised and we flew out to claim victory!\n\nIn keeping with the expansions catchphrase, we were not prepared.\n\nOn the opposing side was a number of members of our server’s then biggest and most successful raid guild, Black Omen. They had come to push our shit in, and like the reverse enema of your darkest nightmares, they began to do exactly that. They crashed into our tidy line of mounted adventures and immediately reaped a dark harvest.\n\nExcept for Dyno, he kept on going. \n\nAll 9 of us rezzed at the spirit healer wondering what the damnable hell just happened when we saw the inevitable warning that the Horde had captured out flag. We rushed back but we didn’t see them coming out. We searched around and then found the enemy flag carrier…on our roof. With two Belf Paladin healer, just standing there. \n\nThe enemy flag carrier was a Tauren warrior, armored in the Joel Schumacher-esque goth dayglow nightmare gear that made TBC’s art direction so god awful yet delineated a clear owner of Black Temple raid gear. He was prot, with shield in hand. We noble Alliance warriors charged, heedless of the danger.\n\nMeanwhile, Dyno had actually managed to grab the Horde flag. Mind you he is by himself and as we watch the entirety of the remainder of the Horde team is trying to lock him down. Whatever they are doing is terrible because he managed to evade capture and start hoofing it around the map like he has the key to the Ark of the Covenant and the Nazis were after him. \n\nWith the rest of the team, I charge in to the enemy FC. I was playing my Arms Warrior, and I rolled in giving my best ARCHANITE REAPER HOOOOO impression and laid down my big crit shot. I saw the number appear the FC’s head.\n\n“8” it said. In big bold yellow! EIGHT MOTHERFUCKER ARE YOU NOT PROUD.\n\nQuickly we find out best efforts fruitless against this bull-man titan of plate. What little damage we do, one of the Belfs heals. We try and attack one of the healers and the other one heals him. Meanwhile The Tauren starts shield slamming us into other decades. I watched as the figure of death we started calling ‘the raid boss’ one shot a mage by spell reflecting his own fireball. Like he was a goddamn ant. \n\nAll this time Dyno just keeps trucking. After one ignoble death I get to witness this True American (Azerothian?) Hero in action. He is trundling around the house near the Alliance Graveyard while the opposing team is clearly split up trying to find him. A troll hunter is nearby but has his back turned. Dyno promptly stuns him and runs in an opposite direction. The stun rolls off and the hunter franticly looks around, none the wiser to where his stumpy prey has fled to.\n\nWe regroup to assault the Raid Boss again and realize we need strategy. We break out all the utility tools. We assign people to fears, sheep’s, and stuns, while banking  that our only hope is to get our rogues behind the Raid Boss to avoid his shield block from preventing all the damage. I like to imagine we assembled on the roof again, this time with a grim determination and purpose that only being consistently humiliated can bring.\n\nWe launched into action. Healers sheeped! Get that succubus charming next. Who is on the next CC effect? We started calling out the Raid Boss’s health percentage like we were a progression raid about to get a world first. Sour plan started to work. HIS HEALTH STARTED TO DROP! The Healers were stunned and getting interrupted! We could do this! A warlock was our MVP, laying down a fear just before the healers could bubble and we finally got The Raid Boss into Execute range. I have never pressed a button with more relish in my life. \n\nThe Tauren’s hit the turf, and we recapped the flag…and that’s when we noticed Dyno making a beeline for the tunnel with the entire Horde team having finally figured him out and closing in behind. Our moment of destiny was upon us.\n\nWith a unity of purpose, we launched back into the tunnel just as they reached Dyno at the tunnel entrance. He was immediately cleansed and healed as he hit the sprint power up and he went for the flag room. I followed and saw the most terrible of revelations…the Raid Boss was back and we was closing back in on the flag. I needed to stop him.\n\nI charged and MORTAL STRIKE…for…27. But hey, the charge stun bought Dyno the time he needed and THE HORDE FLAG WAS CAPTURED. We broke into jubilant celebration, mostly in the graveyard, because remember the enemy team was all raid geared and destroyed us. \n\nWe ended up losing 3-1 after that, but it didn’t matter. We had slayed the Warsong Gulch Raid Boss, capped the flag, and restored our honor.  I could play this game for another 12 years and I doubt that experience will ever be topped. \n",

        "text": "Today, I played in the most enjoyable session of D&amp;D I have ever played, and it had very little to do with me.\n\nIf you've read any of my past stories, you might notice that I tend to purposefully come up with terrible plans and see how they work out. Often, and to the credit of the groups I play with, it works out in our favor. Whether it's blowing up a white dragon in a single round, catfishing an ogre, or getting silver phalluses painted all over Baldur's gate, I tend to keep the game interesting. However, it seems that newer players have yet to learn that they should take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nFor the purposes of this story, I will refer to the ranger in our party as Steven and the sorcerer as Brody.\n\nWe were playing an Adventurer's League game (basically official games organized by WotC), and Steven and Brady were two young teenagers who regularly come in with their parents. Due to some table switching, we all played together for the first time. After promising a giantess that Steven would seduce her tribe's chieftain so that she could be with her husband, we headed to Waterdeep to shop our little hearts out.\n\nWhile we were petering around an item shop, Steven asked about an Oathbow, and the shopkeep told us that they have one, but it's 30,000 gold, well beyond what we could afford at sixth level. Steven, being a teenager, went full Eeyore as he saw the object of his desire slipping away, so I jokingly told him he could always just steal it.\n\nI could see the idea taking hold as excitement spread across his face.\n\nAt that very moment, I said two things. To Steven, I said, \"Keep in mind there are going to be a ton of security countermeasures in a shop that sells magical items,\" and to the DM I said, \"I quickly exit the shop and head to a pub at least a block away.\" Several party members followed me.\n\nSteven and Brody, however, decided to rob the magic shop. Their plan was fool-proof: they would use magic to force the shopkeep to attack a customer, then they would loot the place after the guards take him away. Obviously, this is airtight, but what if the shop had magical countermeasures? Well, clearly Brody should cast the spell from the crowded Waterdhavian street. Duh.\n\nBrody stepped out into the street and, for no apparent reason, decided to start nonchalantly peeing on the walls of a building across the busy street. Apparently, that's how he wanted to blend in? He then cast his spell, which the shopkeep saved against, and everything went to shit.\n\nThe shopkeep, realizing he was being attacked, shouted, \"Help! Someone is casting spells at me!\" Naturally, the bystanders, and town guards, on the street looked at the man who had been making wild hand motions and chanting incantations while he peed on a wall. The guards moved forward to make their arrest, and the two would-be thieves entered initiative.\n\nSteven went first, and he immediately turned on his friend and tried to restrain Brody so that he wouldn't get in trouble. Classic older brother move. Of course, he failed. Badly. After he failed, he just looked at the crowd like a gerbil at a cat farm and bolted down an alley.\n\nBrody, realizing everything was fucked, cast Rope Trick triggering a Wild Surge that poisoned Steven. Brody's plan was to be safely tucked away in a pocket dimension at the top of a magically suspended rope while the guards stumbled around in confusion. Of course, he had to decide how high to make the portal, and he decided it should be well out of reach of the guards, so about 170 feet up. If you're wondering, his climb speed is 15 feet per turn.\n\nSo the guards reached the bottom of the rope and saw him dangling helplessly a few feet above their heads. They simply shrugged and plugged him with crossbow bolts.\n\nAt this point, he started to see flaws in his plan. The rest of the table, having given up on the possibility of continuing the plot, was dying of hysterical laughter as this operatic drama unfolded in front of us.\n\nNot to be outdone, Steve ran down an alley in a blind panic, completely convinced that the guards were going to catch him next. Naturally, in order to avoid being caught for plotting to commit a crime, Steven once again attempted a serious crime and ordered his panther to break down the nearest door so he could hide inside. This genius plan to commit a Breaking and Entering while hiding from the authorities was hampered when he rolled a 1 on his check. But not so fast! He had a point of inspiration granting him a single reroll... and it's a 2. He simply terrified the occupants by flinging a clumsy apex predator at their door.\n\nBy now, both Steven and Brody were blaming me.\n\nAt this point, the DM asked the rest of us if we were in any way involving ourselves in this beautiful fiasco, and the only one of us who did not opt to remain perfectly clear of this was the mother of these two young men, who took the opportunity to throw rocks at town guards to distract them from Brody. Clearly, planning skills are a familial trait.\n\nAt this point, the mother of this pair said, \"Don't you dare run away like he did,\" to which the intrepid Brody replied, \"I cast Gaseous Form and float away.\n\nThe DM asked for an acrobatics check to keep hold of the rope, which Brody failed. He plummeted a full fifteen feet and knocked himself unconscious, ending the session as his mother faced down seven guards in his ungrateful name.\n\nIt was beautiful.\n",

        "text": "An older man sits at his desk, papers strewn about. A young woman comes up behind him, and rubs his shoulders some. “Come join us, we’re having a party.” The man sighs, “I can’t, I’m still writing the play.” “The one with the dragons and that ridiculous villain?” “Yes, that one. I’m in love with the ending, but for some reason I can’t sit down and write the dialogue by myself.” “Well,” she leans forward, “the four of us are just waiting for you to come out and hang out. We’re playing your characters, let’s help you with the dialogue.” He throws his hands up, “all right, what’s the worst that could happen. Lead on, Jill.” Jill leads the playwright to the other room, where three more people are talking and drinking. “Look who’s come out to play! Let’s all listen up, all right?” The man straightens up some papers he’s holding, and reads off them. “Well, I’ll start from here. They got to this small city on the way to New Aurora, it was called\n\n“Leraghan. A one-horse town adapted to house a hundred horsemen. Stuck between mountains to the north and the forest to the south, Leraghan was originally no more than an inn along the Young Road, a vital trade road between the kingdoms on the West and East of the Whitebase Mountains. Now that they’ve all been united under the Egalitarian Republic, which is a bit of a misnomer since I haven't seen no eagles, it’s the best defended little town in the world, and got more military presence than Solstice in Illustria.” Sillith smiled at her cleverness, and looked expectantly at her compatriots. “You guys are listening, right?”\n\nGeldin turned his head back, “I was, lass. Good t’ know wha’ yer gettin’ inta, even if i’s jes’ total safety. Means I don’ haffta worry. I liked yer story. Only, I never been t’Illustria, so I din’t get yer joke.”\n\nSillith frowned. “Me neither.” Noting her duty as a self-proclaimed bard, Sillith considered asking if they were there yet, but before she could, they were.\n\n***\n\n“Now, we’re a couple days away from New Aurora still, but we do have the supplies to make it there comfortably, so we don’t have to stop. I don’t know about any of you, but I could use a drink at the tavern here, and I suggest we stay for a few hours.” Ulfbert looked to the others.\n\n“I need to buy some things for my, uh, fluffy pets,” said Sillith, eyeing the villagers walking nearby.\n\n“I think that settles it,” said Furrio. “If Sillith needs something, and Ulfbert has suggested that we stay, then we’ll stay.”\n\n“If everyone’s agreed, then, let’s do it,” agreed Ulfbert.\n\n“Thank you, that is what I said”\n\n“Well, I was agreeing with you.”\n\n“Right, your loyalty is appreciated.”\n\nUlfbert smile wryly. “Loyalty, eh? You figure you’re running things, then?”\n\n“Naturally. I’m the strongest, the smartest, and as far as I can tell I’m the most invested with saving the world with this prophecy, too, so I think that makes me the leader.”\n\n“Now why’d we have to have a leader?”\n\n“Well I suppose it doesn’t matter, but it could come up at some point, if we need to make a decision.”\n\n“What exactly do you think ‘we’ is? ‘Fore a few weeks ago, Geldin was just going to leave, is he beholden to your royal decree? What’s tying any of us to you?”\n\n“Well, the prophecy, obviously. I don’t think Geldin’s part of the prophecy, he seems more like your follower, so he’s not part of decision-making, and should just listen to you.”\n\n“Now that’s hardly fair,” said Ulfbert.\n\n“Nah, I think ‘e’s right,” said Geldin. “I’m followin’ you, but I dunno ‘bout th’ others.”\n\n“Alright, Sillith, who are you following?” Ulfbert looked at where Sillith was, but she was gone. “Er, Ara’k-azur?” The orc was explaining something to a blind old woman. “Oh no, we’d better sort this out.” When Ulfbert turned back to Furrio, he too was gone, questioning some guard. Geldin shrugged at Ulfbert, and the two approached Ara’k-azur.\n\n“No, see, I can see that you’re blind now, what I was wondering is if I could get a new eye somewhere, since I’m half-blind.”\n\n“Yee-as,” croaked the old woman, “men of you-er sort er haff blin’, yee-as. Butchou see tha’, sa you-er na less blin’ than I.” She grinned and pointed to her blank eye as she said this last word.\n\n“Yes, see, well, no, I don’t understand. I can only see out of one eye.”\n\n“Theh skiesh er chanchin’, d’you see tha’?”\n\nAra’k-azur looked up. “No, looks pretty — oh! Oh, that cloud is moving, yes.”\n\nShe laughed. “Na, chile, theh stairs! Theh stairs den’ spee-ak lih’ thay use-ta. Ther spinnen, an if I c’n see ‘t’all, ther spinnen rounchou, chile. You-er nee-er theh cenn’r, yee-as.”\n\nThe orc looked to Ulfbert. “I don’t really understand most of these words.”\n\n“You wheel, you wheel,” she continued. “Heed my fort-yoon wehl, we won’ survife lohn wit’ theh stairs spinnen like thee-er.” She looked satisfied, and her expression changed. “That’s ten gold for a fortune, love.”\n\nUlfbert and Ara’k-azur exchanged confused glances. Not knowing what else to do, Ara’k-azur handed ten gold pieces to the old woman, who gave a “Rhea bless,” and waddled off.\n\nFurrio rejoined the others. “There’s a mechanik in town, back at the military district. We can check for an eye for-” he stopped himself. “People can make mechanikal eyes here, right?”\n\n“Right,” said Ulfbert, “I don’t know how it works, but- what do you mean here? I thought you were from Munida, the technology’s no different anywhere else on the continent.”\n\n“Yes, well, maybe I should’ve traveled more growing up. You should go get that drink you wanted, I’ll take Ara’k-azur to get a new eye.”\n\nUlfbert looked as if he was about to say something, and then shrugged. He turned to Geldin. “Want to find a smith’s shop? I could work on our weapons a bit while we wait for those idiots.” The dwarf nodded.\n\n***\n\nSillith approached a stall selling surplus military gear, sizing up bits and pieces to see if they could be repurposed for her abominations. She overheard a middle-aged human in dark robes with a horrid cracking voice arguing with the merchant one stall over. “No, I- I understand she’s not th- the god of this l-land, but I need, I, we’re doing a, uh, we need Enn’s power, you see, her, her sigil is, it’s very, I need that specif, uh, specifically.”\n\n“Sorry, sir, you can ask all you want, I just don’t have a Sigil of Enn. Neutrality to Enn and Loh is very important to the Republic politically, a-”\n\n“No! I, I, I won't be edu, uh, ranted at, by, uh, a shop, uh, person about deities and, the gods, and, no! I am very uh, knowledgeable, about these things! You have nothing, nothing to, uh, to tell me! Yes! No! Not a thing!”\n\nThe man stormed off, but didn’t get far before Sillith intercepted him. “You’re looking for a symbol of Enn?”\n\n“Yes! Yes, I would greatly, uh, we need it very, yes, very much for, our purposes, which are very, well, I, uh, shan’t just be, uh, who are you?”\n\n“That’s not important, but I have a friend who could likely make you one. What do you need it for?”\n\n“Well, uh, I, we, my friend, he’s a- well he’s not, yes, a paladin, you see, and we need, uh, Enn has lawful, uh power, you see, and the Paladin was, er they are lawful, too, and Haen doesn’t, well, He’s not, we need Enn’s power for this rite, er, rites of, umm, I shouldn’t really, sorry, who are you again?”\n\n“I’m an adventurer.”\n\n“Oh! Adventurers! We need those! Well, uh, some, we need, yeah, you’re not a, uh, latent magic-user by chance?”\n\n“Yes, I am.”\n\n“Oh joy! And, uh, do you happen to know if your power is, uh, mundane?”\n\n“It’s not, but I think I have a friend who has latent mundane powers. In fact I probably have two, but don’t ask the bigger one about it.”\n\n“You must take me to them! Oh, fan- just fantast- just great!”\n\n***\n\n“You’re not with the EVA, are you?”\n\nAra’k-azur and Furrio exchanged glances. “The what?”\n\n“The Egalitarian Volunteer Army, and if you don’t know, then you’re not. So why are you bothering me?”\n\n“Well,” Furrio continued, “you’re Daisy, right?”\n\n“Yep,” replied the dwarf.\n\n“So you’re the best mechanik in town, I hear.”\n\n“I am the mechanik in town, that’s correct.”\n\n\"Why doesn't our dwarf talk like that?\" whispered Furrio to Ara'k-azur, then said to Daisy, “well, I had a sword I wanted you to look at.”\n\nAra’k-azur threw an odd glance at Furrio, who took his sword out and laid it on the counter. It had a beautiful blade, curved like a xiphos and sharp on both sides, and not very long. The hilt had a large purple gem at the pommel, which glowed faintly whenever someone held it.\n\n“Enn grace me, where did you find *this*?”\n\n“Uh, it was in a curio shop in Munida.”\n\n“Well, where did the storekeeper say it came from?”\n\n“He didn’t.”\n\n“This gem looks like it comes from Mahgken. It has latent magical properties within it, which is incredible, you see, because arcane forces are nothing more than the minds of particularly spirited individuals, so to have it present without intention is just crazy! I didn’t think these things were real! Wow!”\n\n“Yes, it’s a very cool sword,” agreed Furrio. “Now, could I attach some mechanika to it?”\n\nDaisy blinked. “Oh. Uh, I don’t know. It looks like the energy is concentrated down the blade, probably through a thin chamber of aether in the middle of the hilt, but I can’t be sure without breaking it, and I could never put it back together. No idea how it works, really, so I couldn’t tell you. I bet you could find out more if you went to New Aurora. Did you need anything else?”\n\n“Yes,” said Ara’k-azur, “I need a mechanikal eye. More than he needed you to look at that rock.”\n\n“Ah, perfect! It’s really quite fortunate, we recently had a couple higher-ups blinded, so I had these made up, but they died in the field, so I can sell one to you at a discount! Isn’t that good news?” The dwarf placed a box of various mechanikal parts on the desk in front of her, a couple of odd-looking brass spheres being at the top. The spheres had a circle of coloured glass that looked like an iris, transparent in the very center (our contemporary readers would recognize a camera lens), and were clearly the eyes the mechanik spoke of.\n\nFurrio leaned in to whisper in Ara’k-azur’s ear. “Watch this. Be ready to grab one of those and run.”\n\n“What’s that?” asked Daisy, suspiciously.\n\n“This.” In an odd display of dexterity for a man so large, covered in heavy ornate power armour, Furrio put his arms out and shaked his hands in a manner which is unnamed in Kephrea, but we might be willing to refer to as “jazz hands.” Daisy appeared to be so taken aback by this that she started laughing, lightly at first, but then totally uncontrollably, falling off her stool onto the ground in an irresistible fit of hysterics. Ara’k-azur saw his chance, and grabbed one of the eyes. Before the mechanik could get ahold of herself, they bolted.\n\n***\n\nThe large thieves almost ran right into Sillith and her new friend. Before she could get a word in, Furrio and Ara’k-azur hurriedly ushered them into the nearest (the town’s only) tavern.\n\nSillith introduced her compatriots to the stranger, and realized she didn’t know the man’s name.\n\n“Muh-my name’s Carl. I, uh, h-hear one of you is a muh, muh, mundanist?”\n\nFurrio replied right away, “If you want to talk about that, we’re going to need drinks.” \n\nAfter some arguing, Carl agreed to buy a round of ale, and asked who the mundanist was.\n\n“That is I,” said Ara’k-azur.\n\n“N-now, this may seem, ah, strange, b-but, have you ever, ah, fought a, uh, ah, a mons, uh, monster, a-and then you, ah sort of, of, found you could, ah, well, you suddenly, well, did what the, uh, the monster, uh could d-do, like, uh, not m-magically, b-but, ah-”\n\n“Yes. That power has been passed down to me from my father, Aka’d-azur Shamanbrood, and it was passed to him by his father before him, and so it has been in my tribe for all of memory. Our love for the beings of the Keph has kept us in tune with them to such depth that we have always been able to work the same forces that guide them.”\n\nCarl stared slack-jawed for a moment. “I- th-th-th-this is incre-e-e, uh oh my, wow, yes! That’s- a whole tribe of- yes! Wow! Okay, uh, so, uh, h-have you h-heard of, uh, this, uh, the, uh, the b-blight?” Ara’k-azur simply stared. “R-right, o-of c-course, haha, yes, uh, of course. Well, there is this being, the *charm wyrm* , that has the power to weaken the blight wyrm and other forces of the blight, and, well, we, uh, we know where it is, and, uh, we, we need your, uh, h-help. It, uh, won’t come out to, uh help, so we were hoping to, s-steal, its power.” Carl paused, and caught his breath. This was the most composed he’d been so far. “Have you heard of the Netzer brothers?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“A paladin and arcanist, they’re trav-v, uh, trav, going around and building this, uh, army to, uh, well, kill the, uh, blight wyrm. They, uh, my friend is, uh he’s this p-p-paladin, and, uh, he’s uh, uh, h-helping the, uh brothers, and, well we, we, are tasked w-with getting the, uh charm wyrm’s h-help, or, uh, as close as we, uh, can.” Some heavy footsteps were heard from upstairs.\n\nSillith perked up. “A paladin!? Here?”\n\n“Uh, yeah, he sh-should be down any, uh minute. Anyway, Ar-r, uh, Arrr, uh,”\n\n“Ara’k-azur.”\n\n“Yes. Do you w-want to h-help us?”\n\n“I don’t know, funny man. I have a mission of my own right now. A group of arcanists killed my best friend, Two-fa-”\n\n“We’re in,” said Furrio. “You may not believe it, but we are the subjects of a prophecy, and I will not accept that my comrade’s gift is a coincidence. We were meant to destroy the blight wyrm, and I’ll see to it that we do.” The heavy footsteps were now descending the staircase behind them.\n\n“Wait one moment, mighty-hammer,” said Ara’k-azur. “We still need to learn more about the prophecy in New Aurora, or did you forget? What makes you so sure it’s about this blight wyrm?”\n\n“We will go to New Aurora to confirm,” said Furrio, “but that is hardly necessary. I can feel this in my heart.”\n\nSillith jumped out her chair and pointed at the impressive figure standing at the base of the stairs. He was clad in golden armour, and had a somewhat gaunt mustachioed face and wild hair. Most of the tavern’s patrons were looking, though many had seen him the day before. He smiled handsomely at Carl, and walked towards the group, totally unphased by the party’s reaction (Furrio was also standing awestruck by his presence, his hands placed emphatically on his helmeted head). “Are you going to introduce me to our friends, Carl?”\n\nCarl smiled broadly. “Sir Rephael, Paladin Defender, meet Arakidur, the shaman, mundanist, and eminent appropriator!”\n\nRephael’s smile broadened to the size of Carl’s, and he stuck his hand out for Ara’k-azur to shake. “Please, for a friend as dear as I know you will become, just Rene is fine.”\n\n“And you can call me Ara’k-azur, for that is my name.”\n\nSillith shrieked like, well, like a young elven bard meeting a legendary hero. “You’re Rene the Renegade, Expert Gambler, Superb Rider, Exquisite Prowler, Graceful Cleaver, Legit Paladin! Furrio, this is the guy that prophecy was about!”\n\nRene looked at Sillith with confusion on his face, and Furrio said, “wow, what a strange occurrence. There’s no mirror here, yet according to you, I’m looking at myself.” He turned to Sillith. “Seeing a hero like him is a real treat, but the prophecy is about us, Sillith.”\n\nShe rolled her eyes. “Let’s let the scholars of New Aurora decide that. For now, Rene, it’s such an honour to meet you. You have to tell me about fighting Tyranny!”\n\nRene’s smile weakened. “Perhaps someday soon. After all, we’ll have a lot of time when we’re travelling together. You are with Ara’k-azur, aren’t you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But you’re headed to New Aurora? That’s a bit inconvenient, as we’re headed to Haensland from here, right Carl?”\n\n“Th-that’s right, Sir,” said Carl. “I th-think that’s, uh, best.”\n\nRene said, “Well, we’ll take a couple of weeks in Haensland, won’t we Carl?” Carl nodded. “So, why don’t you three meet us there when you finish up in New Aurora, and then we can travel together to find the Charm Worm.”^1\n\n“Sounds like a plan, man, but we’re actually five, if that jives,” said Furrio.\n\nRene chuckled, “that works for us I’m sure.”\n\nSillith started fidgeting. “I’d love to stay and talk to you more, Mr. Renegade, but I really have to use the washroom.” Sillith bolted for the restroom, and Rene left the tavern with Carl. Ara’k-azur and Furrio argued for a couple minutes about the prophecy, until Furrio interrupted to ask, “wait a minute — have you seen Fox?”\n\n***\n\nUlfbert and Geldin stepped into the tavern, to see Ara’k-azur slumped over the bar, surrounded by empty glasses. “For Haen’s sake,” Ulfbert said, “it’s scarcely past midday. And where are the others?”\n\n“I don’ know,” said Geldin. “Ye migh’ ‘swell give ‘im ‘is axe back if ‘e’s awake.”\n\nUlfbert prodded Ara’k-azur, and he sat upright. “I’m not drunks,” he slurred.\n\n“Great. I’ve finished making a halberd, so now I can fight properly, and here’s your improved axe. Where are the others?”\n\n“Carl bought these for me,” said the Orc, pointing to the empty glasses. “He’s the man.”\n\n“Right. Fantastic.” Ulfbert turned to Geldin. “I think this means no more splitting up in towns.”\n\n“‘Less ye get lucky in New Au’ra,” said Geldin, “maybe th’ prophecy won’ be ‘bout them, an’ we can leave ‘em behin'.”\n\nUlfbert smiled. “We can only hope. Let’s find the others and get there as soon as possible to find out.”\n\nSillith came from their right, surprising them. She was wearing a broad smile. “Are we following the paladin?” she asked.\n\n“Paladin?” asked Ulfbert. “Do you know about this?” he asked Ara’k-azur. \n\n“Non’t noooo... yeah! Renega’! He went to haaaayn...” Ara’k-azur fell off his stool.\n\nBy the time he was helped up, Furrio rejoined them. “Fox was hiding in the lavatory. Anyone know why?” But nobody admitted that they did. He simply shrugged. “Well, so long as Ara’k-azur can walk, I guess we’re off to New Aurora.”\n\n***\n\nA rather thin orc wearing circular wired spectacles, fairly nice clothing, and a long grey ponytail looked up at them. “And who exactly is asking?” he said.\n\n“We’re adventurers. We’ve uncovered an ancient Auroran prophecy, and we wanted to talk to someone here about it,” replied Ulfbert.\n\n“I see,” said the Orc. “Well, I suppose you’ll want to talk to Ouzlak, he’s the local expert on Auroran history. Normally that would make him the busiest man on this campus, but with times being what they are, he might be the only wizard around who’s not too busy to see you. The astrology department-”\n\n“That’s great,” said Furrio, “I guess history’s day is in the past, eh?” He had his helmet off, and was waggling thick Ogrun eyebrows at the orc. Somehow this made the orc chuckle. “Where can we find him?”\n\n***\n\nA nice oaken door with a golden plate reading “Arnold Ouz’lak”^2 opened in front of the adventurers. “Good luck Winslow, this is very promising indeed,” spoke an orcish voice, and a scrawny middle-aged man clutching a few scrolls graciously stepped backwards into the hallway, smiling. He saw the adventurers, nodded, and headed in the other direction.\n\nThe adventurers walked into “Arnold’s” office. Unlike the first orc, and another they’d passed on their way here, here was an orc wearing his hair long and straight, and even sporting facial marks similar (though less artistically pleasing) to Ara’k-azur’s. He looked surprised at the presence of the adventurers, and then smiled. “Explorers!” he said. “And a genuine Ork^3 among you as well! Please, have a seat. I am the eminent Ouz’lack, Wizard of the Archaic tradition.”\n\n“I am Ara’k-azur Shamanbrood, Shaman of the... Shamanbrood tradition.”\n\n“Fascinating. I’d love to talk at length with you about your heritage sometime. Are you around, say, three weeks from yesterday.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh. Then what is it that you want?”\n\n“We were hoping you could help us with an old prophecy, assuming you haven’t forgotten its details over the last millennium,” laughed Furrio.\n\nOuz’lack chuckled politely. “From where is this prophecy?”\n\n“It’s ancient Auroran, we found it in some ruins Southwest of here. We already have it translated, but we were hoping for help with the finer points.”\n\n“Oh, I see. Well, I’m a bit busy for that sort of thing, you should take it up with Winslow Friedrich, a human wizard candidate of mine. He’s very bright, but not doing anything important right now. You just missed him heading to the library.”\n\n“Then we’d better book it there,” said Furrio, and left the room. The others thanked Ouz’lack for his time politely and then followed him.\n\n***\n\nWinslow had a number of books in front of him. He had just opened one when Furrio approached him and asked, “we heard there was a bookworm we should talk to named Winslow. Have you seen a dragon made of pages nearby?”\n\n“Huh?” asked Winslow.\n\n“Bookworm? Book wyrm? Like a dragon? Keep up, kid.”\n\nWinslow looked at the young ogrun face in front of him. He was about to make a point about age, but it was twisted in such a silly expression he had to just laugh and shrug. “Alright, I guess that’s me. What do you need?”\n\n“We found this Auroran prophecy in some ruins. We managed to translate it, but we don’t know what order the fragments should be in. Could you help us?”\n\n“Sure,” said Winslow. They gave him Geldin’s images, and attached translations. “I can tell from the composition of the tablets in these sketches which things would be where on a wall, so that should help.” He explained that the bit where Ta’k-ros introduces himself is the first, followed by the ‘great evil’ driving them from their homes. “That’s Tyranny,” Winslow said. “You can tell by the wording and the story. There are rumours he was killed by some adventurers in Hurm, though.” Winslow continued that the introduction of the four happens right after that, and it ends with the evil not being reborn twice. “The ‘spirit’ might be Fara, the huntress. That’s just a guess though. The Aurorans worshiped Keph principally, and he’s not known to communicate with shamans like that. As for the other four pieces, I can’t tell you anything about their order. Sorry.”\n\n“I had another question,” said Furrio. “Does this gem look like anything to you?” He showed Winslow the crystal in his sword.\n\n“Hmm, I’m no great wizard, but there’s latent magic in this crystal, isn’t there?”\n\n“Yes.\"\n\n“This actually looks like it might be related to my work. Have you heard of the Avians?”\n\nFurrio looked shocked, but the others were just confused. “Tell us.”\n\n“Well, legend has it that back in the first millennium, there was this whole other race of people on Keph, who had feathers and talons, and other birdlike features. They were incredibly intelligent, and had started developing a sort of super-weapon to destroy the monsters of Mahgken. However, they made some other advancement, and gained the ability to use magical crystals to lift whole city-sized chunks of the keph into the air. So, they abandoned this weapon, and just up and left the ground to live in the skies on cities totally safe from monsters. Now, most people don’t believe it, but I’ve uncovered some ancient texts that detail some specific sites where this was supposed to have happened! If people were to investigate these sites, and there were actually city-sized craters with no evidence of other causes, it could lend credence to this previously far-fetched story.”\n\n“Well,” said Ara’k-azur, “we’re adventurers. We do stuff like checking out ancient ruins all the time.”\n\n“Hey, yeah! I’ve been trying to lobby for a scrying, but that’s just too much money and effort these days for theoretical history. Maybe I can get funding for a small expedition, though! We can send another scholar with you, one whose work isn’t as important, and you could visit these sites! I doubt you’d get very much though, on the order of 2000 gold.”\n\n“Interesting,” said Ara’k-azur, with his purse of 150 gold. “It wouldn’t help that they were developing a super-weapon?”\n\n“It might!” said Winslow. “I’ll give this a go. It should only take about two weeks for me to get a proposal together and hear back, will you be around?”\n\n“No. Can you maybe send word to us in Haensland?”\n\n“I’ll try.”\n\nAt this point Sillith rejoined them. She looked very disappointed. “I just went off to research our friend Rene, and look what I found...” Sillith had found an archived letter which claimed that one Sir Rephael had fallen from the order of Paladins, when defending the University of Opulia from a demonic demigod. He supposedly saw his old love Esmeralda and his beloved mount both die, and lost faith in Haen at that moment. Attempting to sacrifice himself, he successfully got the demon demigod under control, but he survived.\n\nUlfbert turned to Winslow. “Would you know anything about more recent events like that?”\n\n“Not really, I don’t pay attention to anything that happened before the year 2400. Did you know there’s like a pseudo-undead plague going around? Crazy! No, for anything after around 2900 you’d want the Bardic Department.”\n\nSillith’s eyes couldn’t be covered by the largest coin on Kephrea they were so wide. “The what.”\n\n***\n\nThey heard the Bardic Department before they saw it. It was an absolute cacophony, a blend of instruments and voices with no shared rhythm or theme. When they opened the doors to the great hall in which the bards were performing, it only became worse. Dozens of people (mostly humans with some orcs) were lined up playing instruments or singing, with no conductor to be seen. After a moment, a very wide orc, the second they’d seen here without a ponytail (including all the others in the ‘orchestra’, and some encountered in the streets outside the school), noticed them, and shouted above the din, “come! Join our Ode to Chaos!” Sillith dropped everything but her harmonica, and joined in for a good eight minutes, at which point the noise fortunately ended. All the other bards went on their way with purpose, but the orc who called Sillith up stayed behind.\n\n“Greetings, friends! My name is Fantasius Gregorius, the renowned bardic wizard. For what reason have you come here, clearly seeking my counsel in particular?”\n\n“I bet he was born ‘Greg,’” whispered Furrio to Ulfbert.\n\n“We’re looking for information on a number of topics,” said Sillith, “but also I was wondering if there are any openings because oh my god all of this is amazing.”\n\n“You’re a little young to be joining our ranks,” said Gregorius, “but I’d be happy to regale you on a number of topics, for a number of topics happens to be my area of expertise.” He was doing something which he seemed to think was what rolling Rs was, although the linguistic basis for this habit is unknown.\n\nThey questioned him on the Paladins, and he spoke at length on the origin of the modern paladins, as well as the original four. They questioned him on Rene specifically, and he offered to give them the entire story of Carl’s Saviours in verse, but they declined. He admitted that he had heard of Rene’s falling, and wished to tell it all as a tragedy, but everyone but Sillith asked him to move on. They asked him about the Blight Wyrm and Charm Wyrm, and he told them all about how they were two of the early great monsters from the Time Before, who avoided being banished to the Dungeon Realm when the Time of Folk began, since they were rather smaller than some of the other monsters. “In those days being smaller than mountain Durvruhl marked you as small fry, so enemies of Blight needn’t take heart,” he said. \n\nThey asked him about the university, and he smiled. “We owe our recent success to Kathros. That man was a bit of a creep before, kept to himself, but with the Egalitarian government offering funds to research a solution to the Blight, he’s really risen to the occasion. Done some amazing work. Really, with the cuts that have been happening at other institutions, and despite my incredible work, I owe this department’s continued existence to him. If you’re interested in the blight, it might be worthwhile trying to talk to him. Word to the wise, though, he, uh, prefers humans.”\n\nAra’k-azur nodded his understanding. “Can you tell us about the Avians?”\n\n“Well, I mainly deal in *fact*,” said Gregorius. “The avians are no more real than, say, the fifth Paladin.”\n\n“There’s a fifth Paladin?”\n\n“No. It’s another myth. Not even the good kind which is corroborated in other stories or historical documents, the made-up kind.”\n\n“Tell us anyway, maybe it is real.”\n\n“Look, the story just says that there was a fifth Paladin adventuring with Tyranny, Freedom, Slaughter, and ‘Paladin’. People noticed that the gods of the Eastern pantheon, Haen, Neth, Sei, and Enn, create a sort of cross pattern. Haen and Neth are opposites, as are Sei and Enn. Well, Paladin embodies aspects of Haen and Enn, Freedom Haen and Sei, Tyranny Neth and Enn, and Slaughter Neth and Sei. So, somebody thought, ‘maybe a fifth one was in the middle, totally neutral.’ This one is called Nature. Supposedly she was a great mediator, and only comes out in times of great imbalance. However, there have been many times of great imbalance and she’s never been spotted outside of one made-up story, so she’s made up. Just like the avians.”\n\nWith all their questions answered, the party went down to meet Kathros. Or rather, the human in the party did.\n\n***\n\nUlfbert returned from downstairs. “Well that guy is unpleasant.”\n\n“Did ye’ learn anythin’,” asked Geldin.\n\n“Yeah, they’re planning to cast a spell that will destroy everything blighted at once. Something looked funny to me, so I stole the plans.” He took a large scroll out from under his armour. Everyone got excited at this, worrying that they’d get caught. Nobody seemed concerned that plans which might help end the very problem they were trying to solve had just been misplaced.\n\nSillith looked the plans over. “It’s a *huge* spell. It’s going to need dozens of devoted spellcasters working for hours to cast. They don’t know what kind of energy they’re going for, but once they have that this is pretty much ready to go.”\n\n“That’s the thing,” said Ulfbert. “They seemed like they had no idea what could injure Blight. They had a couple charm whelps chained up down there, but no idea what to do with them. It seemed like this plan was created by one amazing research team, and a totally different one was working on the last bit. If they do decide they know what kind of energy to use, I’m worried they’d be wrong and kill us all.”\n\nSillith tried to assure him that that wasn’t possible, but Ulfbert didn’t budge. “These plans are too dangerous. We’re taking them with us.”\n\nAnd take them they did, through the perilous mountain path straight to Haensland.\n\n***\n\n^1 The different spellings Worm/Wyrm are intentional. It reflects an important difference in pronunciation among different speakers in the original language of the setting, which in turn reflect slightly different etymologies. Essentially, people who say “wyrm” are thinking of a proper dragon, but speakers who use “worm” understand the Charm and Blight Worms to be something totally different. At this point it’s unclear who’s right; accounts of the Charm Worm/Wyrm conflict, and nobody claims to have seen the Blight Worm/Wyrm and lived.\n\n^2 I could write a short book on the orcs of New Aurora, but here it suffices to say that there would be a noticeable pronunciation difference from “Ouzlack” and “Ouz’lack.” Most contemporary orcs with the name would say “Ouzlack”; the wizard probably does differently because of his interest in history and his orcish heritage.\n\n^3 Similar to footnote 2, this pronunciation/spelling is archaic, and its subtext of situating Ara'k-azur as something from the old world was lost on the party.",

        "text": "Our completely competent cast of adventurers\n\nGrit - Half-Orc Cad Fighter\n\nSpack - Human Rogue/Sorcerer \n\nGodrick - Human Slayer\n\nStu - Dwarven Paladin\n\nPhaeros - Inquisitor \n\nWhat a night of adventuring in the Emerald Spire it was. Once again, these completely capable and super cool adventurers journeyed into the depths of the dungeon to the third level. There, Grit managed to bluff his way through two guards who were standing watch over the territory of the Splinter group of thieves. Managing to make them believe him and his friend Godrick were here looking for work on behalf of the Splinters leader, they gained access. Then the two guards met mysterious and sudden deaths. as if someone cleaved them in half. Very odd.\n\nThen the group went through three rooms all filled with thieves. And through all three rooms, Grit managed to bluff his way through, claiming that he lost his way looking for the leader of the guild, who had a job for him. Finally getting the right directions, the party made their way to the chapel of Norgorber, to find the leader of the thieves, Tarrin, leading a small prayer to two other thieves. \n\nOnce again, somehow, Grit managed to bluff his way into making her think that he and his friend Stu were there for a job, while the rest of the party hid outside. After agreeing to some terms, taking out a powerful mage on the sixth floor for later, Grit and Stu realized they never hid those bodies from the first gate. They realized they could not play the long game and charged at the thieves. After getting in some good hits, the leader Tarrin flipped over to the altar and hit a switch. This switch activated an alarm throughout the whole floor. \n\nWho puts a bloody alarm in a chapel?\n\nWe all realized this meant that every thief we managed to bluff would be coming at us. About a dozen or more thieves were coming to kill our level 3 characters. Fun stuff.\n\nGrit and Stu managed to take out Tarrin early after she failed an acrobatic check and fell onto a sword and a warhammer. This didn't help too much for the ten guards trying to get inside. So Spack, dear old, clumsy Spack races outside the doors and tries to use a scroll of fireball on the grouped enemies outside. So of course he fails the check and the scroll fizzles. But, then it starts to tick. This alarms Spack for good reason. The Dm tells his player to roll a d100 every one of his turns. This time he gets a 97 and the scroll continues to tick.\n\nSkipping over a few turns (where Grit poked a mans eyes, where Godrick was stuck posing for three turns, Phaeros shot a lot of people and Stu stuffed a man with his mace), Spack managed to get hit by almost every single enemy outside. Luckily, one rolled a nat one and found himself holding the ticking scroll instead of Spack. Spack then dazed the foe holding the scroll and tried to run away. But a snake bit him and he was knocked out, just inside the chapel, with most of the men outside the doors. Grit ran for Spack and threw him over a pew to keep him safe. For the last few turns, Spack hasn't rolled under a 50 for his d100 rolls. Next turn, Grit uses his action to shut the double doors of the chapel. And on Spacks move, he rolls a 49. \n\nA muffled boom was heard from outside the shut doors and nothing else but some liquid dripping from walls. \n\nSomehow, all of Spacks many, many mistakes have turned out incredibly well for everyone. And we survived that fight somehow, and I'm not sure how truthful the DM was on some of those enemy attack rolls, but I thank him anyway.  ",

        "text": " Hello again! Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment or send me a private message. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThe following tale has no grounding in real life. Any resemblance to people real or fictional is entirely coincidental and hilarious. Please, ABSOLUTELY try running Shadowrun at home.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, a year was not that long a time. Even for something as comparatively short as a human life, a year was often considered a brief period of your existence. For New Zealand, 2071 had been a rough year. A terrorist organisation had besieged the country with a series of devastating attacks: almost two hundred people killed when they detonated an entire trainful of people and even more were slain when a rabid earth elemental was summoned in the heart of Auckland. Worst of all, Ohakuri Dam had been sabotaged and the resulting deluge wiped several small towns off of the map. The group responsible for these atrocities? Earth First, a magically awakened eco-terrorist organisation hellbent on preventing the exploitation of Mother Earth. A six month man-hunt had gone on for the four agents responsible, yet nothing had come of it. Stricter laws had been enforced by A.L.E and Good Samaritan policies had been enacted, making it illegal to not try and prevent a crime in progress. \n\nFor our protagonists, a year was everything. Their lives had changed so drastically, so suddenly, that it had been almost impossible to adapt. Yet adapt they had, with the only other choices open to them being imprisonment or insanity. There had been varying degrees of acceptance to their new situation but they had made the best out of a bad deal. With new skills and a new profession beneath their belts, our designated heroes were prepared to embrace the worst that New Zealand's underworld could offer them. Then tragedy struck and they elected to part ways for their mutual safety. So it was that each of them was alone in the world, with nothing to rely on but their wits. Suffice to say, it was a rough start for all involved. With the passage of time came experience and with experience came employment. For some jobs though, you need a team you can trust. And when there's no-one that you trust, you might find yourself in the company of old friends. \n\n\"So...how is everyone?\" It was a loaded question and everyone knew it. The floor thrummed with vibrations, sound-proofing no match for the party below. This particular nightclub was a well known meeting place for those who frequented the shadows in Auckland and the assembled team had taken advantage of it with gusto. A small round table sat between them, with couches surrounding it on all sides and an empty steel tray resting on top. The speaker found himself the centre of attention, though it was a far-sight better than silence in his opinion. \"Fuck me, how paranoid are you people? Come on people, we were locked in a hole together.\" Hautangi Jackson had always been big yet, against all reason, he had grown bigger since their days in the barn. His muscular frame was completely covered with tattoos, swirling serpents inter-spaced with tribal patterns. The colossal Maori was sipping from his third beer of the evening, an impressive feat given that they had only been here for ten minutes.\n\n\"How about we don't bring that up? Ever. You never know who could be listening.\" Nellie Smytheson sneered at him, her sharp features pinched into a frown of distaste. She cut Hautangi off before he could speak again. \"And how about we introduce ourselves, people who have clearly never met before?\" The bruiser rolled his eyes at her paranoia but acquiesced, settling his large bulk comfortably into the sofa. \n\n\"Fuck's sake. The name's Patu, on account of this.\" He held up the greenstone club, a crackle of electricity bursting to life within the crystal. The group stared blankly at him and he sighed. \"You uncultured bastards, it's a traditional Maori weapon. You call a greenstone patu a 'mere'. It's a bloody weapon focus, alright?\" Patu seemed genuinely irritated at their lack of neo-lithic weapon knowledge. \"I hit things really hard, sometimes with lightning.\" The disgruntled mystic-adept finished his beer in a single gulp, slamming the metal stein onto the table hard enough to shake it.\n\n\"Charming. You can call me Jana. Social infiltrator, pharmaceutical expert and demolitions specialist.\" There were sounds of alarm from around Nellie as the group moved as far away as possible from her. \"Oh don't be stupid. Like I would carry any explosive material on me. What am I, the Unibomber?\" It was like falling into old habits, the snarky comments putting everyone at ease. The event planner sipped from an fluorescent pink drink, her eyes flicking between her acquaintances. Of the entire group, Jana was the most out of place. A thousand dollar cocktail dress hung from her full form in a way that should have made her vulnerable. Instead, the attractive human seemed to wear it almost as armour. \n\n\"Guess I'm next.\" Leilani almost growled as she leaned forward, a nearly untouched bottle of beer in one hand. The veterinarian had an almost animalistic posture, as if she was ready to hunt at any given moment. \"Call me Kahu. Team doctor, sharp-shooter, hacker.\" Lean muscle flexed beneath her leather jacket and her gaze made even the much larger Patu sit up straighter. \"Anyone else notice that the Fat Man hasn't said anything?\" The man in question smiled and gestured to himself.\n\n\"Not so fat anymore. Took your advice and slimmed down a little. Kicked the booze, hit the gym.\" That was an understatement; gone was the rotund Poindexter they had known a year ago. Before them was a well-built man neatly pressed in a blue button up shirt and pants. \"I go by Burnie now. I have the skill to support almost any role but my main-stay is with vehicles. Take them apart, make them better, drive them like no-one else in the world.\" He tipped an imaginary hat with a polite smile before sipping from the glass of water. \"Got a little bit of ware' in me now as well. Helps pay the bills.\" There was a slight chuckle from Patu but that was it. Silence reigned for a moment longer before the door began to open. Instincts and training kicked in; Weapons drawn and pointed within seconds. An aura of scintillating energy roared into life around Patu while Kahu and Jana drew small firearms. Burnie remained at ease, glass held lightly in one hand.\n\n\"Oh...uh. Excuse me. Someone ordered another round of beers?\" The waitress had a practised nonchalance about her but Jana detected the faintest hint of panic in her tone. Weapons disappeared just as quickly as they had been drawn, vanishing into jackets and up sleeves. Through it all, Burnie sipped at his glass of water and smiled. The waitress left her precious, foamy cargo on the tabletop and departed as fast as was socially acceptable. The door clicked shut behind her and business resumed as usual. Patu chugged down another beer before laughing. \n\n\"Still slow, Fat Man. Don't tell me you've gone soft.\" Kahu looked at him questioningly and rolled his eyes. \"All of us pulled a knife or a gun or a great big fucking slab of rock. All of us except for him. Seems like someone's gotten a little rusty.\" Patu mocked before continuing to drink.\n\n\"Seems to me like you're still an idiot.\" Jana snapped. Patu cocked his head, grip tightening slightly on his weapon. \"Take another look.\" Patu grudgingly did so. \"He's perfectly still. No micro-spasms, no minute movements. He hasn't even jiggled his foot since we got here.\" Jana smirked as Burnie raised his glass to her. \"Looks like our Fat Man picked up some impressive reflex enhancing ware. He identified the threat and decided on the outcome before we saw the door open.\" The demolitions expert leaned forward with a sultry smile. \"Mind sharing your source for that lovely bit of enhancement?\" Burnie mimed sealing his lips and tossing away the key with a grin.\n\n\"Sorry, Jana. Some secrets really do need to stay secret.\" Burnie said. Jana pouted and flicked droplets of liquid at the transporter. \n\n\"See if I help you again, Fat-Man.\" They shared a chuckle before Kahu cut through it with a growl. \n\n\"Enough. We're here, let's get down to business.\" She glared at Patu and made a stabbing gesture at the large Maori. \"You brought us back together. Get talking.\" Any humour in the situation died away at that. Everyone sat a little straighter, drinks discarded. Patu cleared his throat and nodded. \n\n\"Fair enough. About a week back, I took on a job for a Johnson. Typical smash and grab, good pay for fuck-all work. The Johnson said he'd let me handle the recruitment process and that we'd split the money however many ways.\" Patu inhaled sharply before blowing it out in an explosive sigh. \"So I decided to handle it solo.\" The group reacted much as he had expected: Jana laughed scornfully, Burnie shook his head and Kahu scoffed in disgust. \"Yeah, not my brightest hour. I fucked the job and now the Johnson wants me to pay him back. Problem is, I don't have a quarter of a million nuyen lying around.\" Burnie whistled at the sum and Jana hummed in agreement. Patu powered through, his argument ready. \"I did a little digging and I found out that Mister Johnson is actually Mister Sen, a wannabe fixer with more money than sense.\" He smirked and emptied his beer in one deep gulp. \"I also know that someone's willing to pay 20,000 nuyen to have Mister Sen stop his operations permanently.\"\n\n\"So you kill the guy out to get you and get paid for it. Smart.\" Kahu growled. It was hard to determine if she seemed more irate or impressed. Patu gave a mock bow, very pleased with himself. \"That's the job then? We help you kill your bad boss, get our cut and then walk away again?\" The sniper asked coolly. \n\n\"That's the long and short of it. I figure that no-one's adverse to making a little dough or getting their hands dirty.\" There were murmurs of assent from around the table. The mystic adept grinned. \"Besides, it's nice seeing you idiots again.\" Jana shook her head vehemently while Kahu scoffed.\n\n\"No. No it isn't.\" Patu looked hurt for a moment before bursting into laughter, unable to pretend anymore. \n\n\"Well, you're not wrong. So, you lot in?\" He asked, throwing his long legs up on the table. Kahu pushed his boots out of her face with a snarl while Jana and Burnie traded probing glances. Silence reigned as the trio spoke to each other without words, using small gestures and facial expressions to communicate. Patu watched on bewildered, drinking heavily at the strange sight. It was Kahu, in the end, who spoke up first.\n\n\"I'm in. Don't make me regret it.\" They all heard the threat in her voice, subtly hidden beneath layers of aggravation and loathing. \n\n\"Why not? Things have been kind of boring as of late.\" Burnie laughed to himself. \"It'll be good to get the band back together.\" The driver admitted, shooting his aggrieved fellows a wide grin. Jana sighed, like a mother watching her children do something stupid. \n\n\"Someone's going to have to stop you bloody idiots from fucking everything up and I never say no to nuyen.\" She simpered into her drink. \n\n\"Yeah, we know. I think we've all seen the videos...\" Patu guffawed until a thick layer of phosphorescent pink liquid covered him. \"Oi, what the fuck?\" He demanded of the now drink-less Jana. She reclined in her seat like a queen on her throne and smiled.\n\n\"I suppose that means we're partners again? Wonderful.\" She clapped her hands demurely before looking at Patu expectantly. \"So, what are we working with here?\" Patu slapped his hands together gleefully and sent each of them a dossier. The Maori mystic leaned forward with an eager smile, dark eyes glinting with murderous joy. \n\nThree days later, the estate of Mister Sen was in full lock-down. There were roto-drones patrolling the grounds and expert security agents at every conceivable junction while a very well-trained Spyder maintained Matrix safety. There was absolutely no chance of anyone being able to infiltrate the hill-side manor, especially not some two-nuyen runner with no team and delusions of grandeur. Such was Mister Sen's thinking as he sat behind three layers of bullet-proof glass, staring out at his vast property. Patu's former employer sipped away at a martini before gently teasing the olive out of his glass with a small pick. Sen smiled at the casual luxury of his life and wondered when Felicia Ornstein would be arriving in his penthouse for her thorough \"debriefing\". The famous sim-sense star was one of his many admirers and had come to show her appreciation for his work in person. Indeed, there was absolutely no way that his life could improve at this point. He reclined with a smirk and then he was consumed in a fiery explosion that tore through his room like wet tissue paper. \n\nFifteen minutes before Mister Sen's unfortunate detonation, a limousine was trundling up to the front gate of the manor. A pair of heavily armed mercenaries aimed their weaponry at the vehicle while another approached the driver's window. The ork raised his gloved hand to knock on the glass when it started rolling down. A chauffeur regarded him with utmost professionalism from beneath his navy cap. \n\n\"Ms Felicia Ornstein and accompaniment to see one Master Harold Sen.\" The lean human's voice held the lively tone of a blue-collar worker not yet disillusioned with their position. \n\n\"Sorry sir, this is a restricted area. We're going to have to ask you to leave.\" The burly security ork stated firmly. Mister Sen's uninvited guest levelled the guard an unimpressed glance from beneath his hat before sighing. He turned over one shoulder and spoke with a disgusting amount of subservience.\n\n\"I apologise, Ms Ornstein. It appears that Mister Sen is unavailable at the moment. Perhaps we can try again later?\" There was a distressed whine from the back of the limousine before the driver's eyes widened. \"Ms Ornstein, I must insist that you not leave the vehicle!\" There was genuine panic in his voice but it was ignored as Felicia stepped demurely out of the vehicle. One of the security agents was gay and his heart still skipped a beat. Before them was one of the most gorgeous women that had ever graced planet Earth with her presence. Her figure was full and soft yet hard with just enough muscle to accentuate her curvaceous form; absolutely none of it was hidden beneath the almost sheer slip of a dress that she wore. The goddess pouted once and traced a finger down the guard's tunic.\n\n\"Are you sure that I can't see Mister Sen? I'm a real big fan of his and I hear that he likes my work just as much.\" Her voice almost dripped with a seductive quality, somehow remaining plaintive despite the tangible sex appeal. One of the freelancers did a double-take, bringing up an AR display.\n\n\"Holy shit. Felicia Ornstein? As in THE Felicia Ornstein, the lead actress in 'One Thousand Knives in Bangkok' and 'Shadows over London'?\" He asked in awe. Felicia giggled and blew him an appreciative kiss. \n\n\"That's the one. I see you're familiar with my material. Though I have to ask...how familiar?\" She purred at the hapless guard. Even beneath the full-body armour, his blush was obvious. His commander shot him a disgusted look and the simsense aficionado scoffed at him.\n\n\"Oh like you've never seen them! They were some of the most popular simsense flicks of 2071.\" The guard spouted proudly, his chest puffing up when Felicia winked appreciatively at him. \"You really think the boss is going to want us to turn away Felicia fuckin' Ornstein?\" He demanded incredulously. The agent shook his head before bringing one hand to his ear. \"Screw it, I'm not denying Sen this chance. He can live for all of us!\" There was a faint crackle of static as the frequency encryption fulfilled it's intended function and he started to speak. \"Mister Sen, this is Matthers. I'm down at the front gate and there's someone here that you really need to meet.\" There was a pause before he nodded eagerly. \"I know we're on high alert, boss, but just hear me out here. It's Felicia Ornstein.\" His smile widened in glee as he listened. \"Yes sir, I've identified her personally. She says that she's a big fan of your work and that she's here to speak with you personally.\" The seconds ticked away as he waited for a response. \n\nOne came as the gates opened slowly, servo-motors drawing the metal monstrosities aside. Matthers saluted adoringly at the simsense star, his knees almost buckling when she took a bow in thanks. She straightened, then straightened her dress as an after-thought, and slipped inside her vehicle. She watched from behind tinted glass as they passed the guard station and scoffed.\n\n\"That was absolutely pathetic. What kind of mercenaries open the gate because you flash them a little tit?\" Patu smirked from behind his dark sunglasses, dressed up as a burly bodyguard. \n\n\"Hey, I'm not complaining. I got to see the view from behind. Very nice.\" He drawled, eyes passing up and down 'Felicia' lecherously. She sneered at him, crossing her arms beneath her bountiful assets. \n\n\"Keep your eyes on the prize, scumbag. We don't need you fucking up like those losers.\" Jana spat at the mystic adept before activating a micro-transceiver. \"Overwatch, what's our position?\" The response was immediate. \n\n\"All sectors clear. Waiting on your green-light for matrix combat.\" Kahu paused. \"He's right, you know. Very nice.\" Jana rolled her eyes good-naturedly before leaning back to rap on the driver's partition. \n\n\"How about you, Burnie? Want to cop an eyeful?\" She jabbed at the pilot. He glanced at her in the rear view mirror before focusing on the winding gravel path before them. \n\n\"Maybe later, thanks. Everyone set to go?\" The playful attitude vanished completely and the bantering misfits were replaced with cold-blooded shadowrunners. Jana began to dab champagne across her cleavage and neck, making the skin glisten alluringly. Patu fixed his tailored suit once again, feeling the reassuring weight of many components hidden throughout the coat. Almost a kilometre away, atop a grassy knoll, Kahu watched through her rifle scope and smirked. \n\n\"Cutting radio contact. Good luck.\" Three short bursts of static acknowledged her statement before their signals vanished completely. The veterinarian watched on impassively, shifting every now and then under the bracing wind. \"Fuck it's cold.\" She growled to herself. \n\n\"Whoopsie daisy! Might have had a liiiiiitle too much to drink.\" Felicia slurred as she clung to her hulking bodyguard. Her diligent driver followed behind with her handbag and a long-suffering expression on his face. He was met with sympathy from the many guards through the manor, though most of them were drawn to the spectacle before them. Felicia laughed uproariously and fixed her dress once more, teasing the watching agents. \"Do any of you fine boys and girls know the way to the rest room? Don't want to meet Mister Sen with a full bladder, I hear that bouncing makes it worse.\" She tittered at the innuendo as one of them pointed her in the right direction. Her attendant steered her in the right direction while the uniformed chauffeur approached a mercenary. \n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but might you have somewhere secure for me to deposit Miss Ornstein's personal belongings? She gets ever-so angry when her things are lost.\" He held the purse up as he spoke. The guard chuckled and slapped him on the back in an overly-friendly way.\n\n\"Sounds about right for these debutantes. I'll take you to the security hub, you can wait there for her if you like.\" He radioed the Spyder that he would have company, ignoring the whine of protest. \"You must have some pretty crazy stories, eh pal?\" He cajoled, elbowing the driver as they ascended a stairwell. Burnie gave a small smile in response. \n\n\"You have no idea.\" On the other side of the building, Patu had changed into a loose uniform for Sen's maintenance company. He was amazed that they hadn't even received a pat-down but Jana was a damn good actress, among other things. His suit was neatly folded up and the mystic adept swore that he would come back for the tailored outfit if he had to kill every guard in the manor. He and Jana moved quickly now, using the blueprints that Kahu had dredged up to locate the basement entrance. They slipped past the single guard posted to this sector with ease, Patu proving surprisingly quiet for someone so large. They were most of the way down before encountering their first problem: A pair of maintenance workers dressed exactly like Patu. \n\n\"Hey guys. I didn't know anyone else was meant to be...\" The female ork trailed off, her eyes fixed on the scantily clad Jana. Her coworker fared little better, hypnotised by the stunning woman. \"Aren't you Felicia Ornstein? What the hell are you doing down here?\" Those were dangerous thoughts for the worker to have but Jana knew a way to deal with that. She stumbled into the ork, who caught her reflexively, and leaned in close.\n\n\"My hero.\" Jana growled, nipping at the stout woman's ear. Her target's eyes widened and then flickered shut in ecstasy. \n\n\"Be gentle with me.\" The ork murmured before seizing up as a massive electrical current surged through her body. Jana dropped her unconscious form with a cruel smirk, stroking the hair from her face. Patu moved quickly, pummelling the other worker senseless before he could react. They dragged the insensate labourers somewhere secure before nodding at each other and heading to work. \n\n\"Nothing wrong with a little girl-on-girl action.\" Patu mused as he ripped away some of the basement wall, his massive muscles flexing angrily. Jana smacked him across the head before mounting his shoulders in a single move.\n\n\"Shut up and start handing me what I need.\" She commanded from her perch above, ignoring the smirk she felt between her thighs. Patu obeyed silently for once and began passing up the necessary components for several shaped charges; his specifically modified suit allowing them to smuggle the explosives in without a problem. \"Hope Burnie's handled the Spyder. Really don't want to kill any of these mooks if we can help it.\" Jana muttered under her breath in between wiring the igniter. Two floors above her, the Spyder gurgled and gasped in Burnie's hands. The lithe elf tried to struggle free but his attacker remained determined. Finally, the Matrix Security Agent succumbed to the blissful embrace of unconsciousness. Burnie dropped him beside a motionless guard with a dull thud, straightening up his tie in the process, before plugging a small dongle into the elaborate surveilance set-up in front of him. He triggered a single burst of static from his comm-link before slipping out of the security room. \n\n\"Finally.\" Kahu smirked to herself as her body went limp and her Virtual Reality augmented mind sped through Cyber-Space. She erased security records, deactivated back-up drones and triggered an all-points alarm at the south side of the manor. It was lucky that Kahu had been monitoring the Spyder when Burnie attacked or his silent call for help might have been noticed. She waited until the manor was almost empty, with a few scant guards remaining in the foyer, before broadcasting three sharp clicks to her team. She edited our her presence from the node before returning to her body, eyes snapping open to a clear view of her fellows exiting the mansion and driving away without interruption. \"Alright, Patu. Here's a little bit of pay-back for you.\" The recording equipment in her contact lenses whirled to life moments before the top floor of Mister Sen's estate erupted into a fireball almost ten metres tall. Kahu recorded the event stoically before moving towards the rendezvous point.\n\nThe next day, the misfits found themselves gathered in the same booth as before. Patu gladly distributed payment among them before raising a beer in toast.\n\n\"To Ghost! Thanks for teaching us how to be the nastiest motherfuckers around.\" The group chuckled in agreement, taking a drink for their dearly departed mentor. \"Well, ladies and germs, it's been fun.\" The tattooed Maori stood slowly before Jana raised a hand. \"Yes, Felicia?\" He quipped at her, exchanging a high-five with Kahu of all people. \n\n\"Very funny.\" Jana snarked. \"Actually, I was going to suggest that this become a permanent arrangement. We work well together and a year alone has made it clear that we can't trust anyone but each other.\" There were startled looks passed around at her words. \"Oh, don't give me that. I know I'm not the only one who has a hard time buddying up with strangers.\" She sat straighter now, her eyes flicking between them. \"We went through hell together. That counts for something. I don't trust any of you as far as I can throw you but I trust you enough to watch my back.\" Patu rolled his eyes with a snort at the back-handed compliment. \"So, how about it? Partners?\" Jana suggested to the assembled runners.\n\n\"Partners works for me.\" Burnie uttered quietly, winking at Jana. She grinned tightly back. Patu groaned in mock-disgust, dropping his immense frame back into the leather seat.\n\n\"You're not going start hugging each other, are you? Unless there's going to be nudity involved, in which case I'm joining in.\" The awakened runner accepted the knee-kick from Jana with an impudent smirk. \"Sure, sounds fun. I'm in.\" \n\n\"Guess that makes us a team.\" Kahu barked at her colleagues. The sniper knocked back her drink in one gulp before slamming the glass on the table. \"Bunch of murderers, thieves and assholes.\" She snarled without any real malice. The others raised their drinks as if she had toasted and Kahu laughed. \"This is who we are.\" \n\ntl;dr Wannabe runners spend a year apart, come back as bad-asses for a one time job. They destroy a secure mansion with a simsense starlet, plastic explosives and the tender application of blunt force trauma. At the end of it all, they decide to stay as a team. New Zealand is in for an interesting year.\n",
