        "text": "More for intermediate or higher learners.\n\n1. Watch anime episode straight through, subtitles completely blacked out (so no english or japanese subs, pure listening and watching). Following the story and just enjoying it without any straining.\n2. After finishing the ep, rewatch with the English subs uncovered and transcribe (type what I hear) in a wordpad file the Japanese for **any sentences I didn't catch the first watch** \\-- as long as I'm confident about the vocab and grammar being used (or if I am really curious about one unknown word and know everything else in the sentence, then I can look it up and make a note of its reading in my transcript).\n3. Read through the sentence list aloud to further reinforce them.\n\nNow I know many learners believe using any English at all is horrible and won't help you progress at all and if you ever use subs they should be the Japanese ones -- which I have indeed used many times, BUT. I feel like that could be incorrect in this case. It seems like using an English translation (which I know is often not exact, &amp; more rarely, not even close) as a \"hint\" to help you produce the Japanese you weren't able to 聞き取る the first time, actually trains skills that simply looking at the Japanese subs to give you the answer, wouldn't train. Like reproducing pre-existing grammar and vocabulary knowledge and putting it together to match what the characters are saying. The added effort required to figure it out (including repeated listens) could do more to help solidify one's リスニング力 than just referencing the J-subs right away.\n\nHere's an example, and feel free to skip all of this or only read a few sentences. I watched the second episode of こみっくがーるず for this activity (a recent moe girl anime, don't shoot!). Out of maybe 350 lines of text, the ones I didn't catch at first (but ended up knowing the vocabulary and grammar for upon the 2nd watch) were the following 28. Parts that I  still couldn't understand what they were saying in Japanese, I skipped transcribing completely (I counted 9 such instances, so less than 0.3%. Not bad!):\n\n1. お宝の山です！\n2. しかも目立つポッポ付き？！\n3. 感激です！！\n4. 目的地に行く前にもう一つ寄り道するからね。\n5. うわ、ここ！ここ女子高生しか入れないんじゃああああん？！\n6. あーー。画材屋、早くいきたいけどなー。\n7. いつも夢中になっちゃって、気が付くとフラフラでしょう？先に何かお腹に入れておかないと。\n8. クレープだけでメニューの数がこんなに？!\n9. 私のも一口食べる？\n10. 翼さんのキラキラした顔初めて見ました！\n11. カッコいいけど、使いにくそうだね。\n12. 羽ペン似合いすぎ！！＊＊＊（７：０４）\n13. 便利だからいくつあってもいいわよねー！\n14. お小遣いぎりぎりまで使っちゃった！\n15. マスキングテープは諦めようかなー\n16. この前原稿手伝ってもらったから。\n17. 結局夜通し（よどおし）話しちゃいましたねー\n18. 今朝、インクぶちまけたやつ。\n19. 学校中には漫画書いてるの秘密なんですか？\n20. だって、内容が内容だしね。バレルと大変でしょう。\n21. というわけで、今からタメ語で、ね？：）\n22. 本名名乗るの久々！！\n23. 私は見る派（は）で！\n24. でもさ、これどこまで食べていいかなって思うじゃん！食べ放題！\n25. それは私が普通の女子高生の世界に足を踏み入れるの、怖がってばかりいたからだと思います。\n26. すみません。一瞬でも同類のように思ってしまって…\n27. 楽しそうでちょっと焼けちゃう。\n28. 具体的な話が色々聞けちゃって！\n\nIt's possible that some fraction of these I would've been able to catch without using the english subs the second time, simply from repeating the audio with no hints. But it seems as though not being used to hearing certain words or phrases used in speech, or used to the way the characters say certain things, may have made it more difficult, which imo isn't necessarily beneficial for learning. I think having the English there for the second round made that connection of \"ohhh, so THAT'S what they were saying?\" happen a lot faster than it would've otherwise. But without simply giving me the answer like looking at the J-subs would, so I still had to use my ear. This is just my theorizing! What do you guys think of this kind of method for upgrading rough spots in ones listening?",

What's slightly less well-known is that each of these 12 is also associated with a time of day, a compass direction, and a month:\n\n&gt;子\tfirst sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Rat, 11pm-1am, north, November)\n\n&gt;丑\tsecond sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Ox, 1am-3am, north-northeast, December)\n\n&gt;寅\tthird sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Tiger, 3am-5am, east-northeast, January)\n\n&gt;卯\tfourth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Hare, 5am-7am, east, February)\n\n&gt;辰\tfifth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Dragon, 7am-9am, east-southeast, March)\n\n&gt;巳\tsixth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Serpent, 9am-11am, south-southeast, April)\n\n&gt;午\tseventh sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Horse, 11am-1pm, south, May)\n\n&gt;未\teighth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Ram, 1pm-3pm, south-southwest, June)\n\n&gt;申\tninth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Monkey, 3pm-5pm, west-southwest, July)\n\n&gt;酉\ttenth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Bird, 5pm-7pm, west, August)\n\n&gt;戌\televenth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Dog, 7pm-9pm, west-northwest, September)\n\n&gt;亥\ttwelfth sign of the Chinese zodiac (The Boar, 9pm-11pm, north-northwest, October)\n\nSome of these kanji are relatively obscure, but some are extremely common even in contexts unrelated to the zodiac itself. For example, 午 should be immediately recognizable to any first-year Japanese student as meaning \"noon\", as in 午前, 午後, 正午, etc. The reason for this is immediately obvious if you notice that the sign of the Horse is associated with 11am-1pm, which is basically noon.\n\nBut, the others are less obvious...the sign of the Ram, for example, is used in time-related words as well, but I have no idea why it specifically is used in 未だ or 未来 or any of the other familiar 未 words that typically are related to something occurring before something else. The Monkey is used in 申す, but why? The kanji for the Bird (酉) is strikingly similar to the kanji for west (西), and the Bird is associated with the west, so it seems like there's a connection there, but what exactly is it?\n\nI can probably find answers to these specific questions myself, but what I'd really like is an overview of all of the signs and how they came to be used as they are in non-zodiac contexts. Some might just have been randomly assigned from the time when Chinese characters first started to be used, but I expect there's an interesting story behind most of them. Google has given me plenty of information on the Chinese zodiac itself, but I can't find anything relating the kanji to their modern Japanese usage. It's esoteric, I admit, but this is the sort of thing that helps me to understand and retain vocab better in both English and Japanese, so I'd really like to understand it better.",

I saw a video that was teaching all the hiragana, and she accidentally wrote \"ri\" in katakana instead of hiragana (I think she's japanese, so idk why she would make this mistake; maybe it's like how some native speakers of english mispell things, but I know that's a bad comparison), then I found a kids song called,\"どんぐりころころ\", but some videos spelled it,\"どんぐリころころ\". I found a screenshot of the japanese version of paper mario, and a character says,\"あリがとう\" instead of,\"ありがとう\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also found a video that was for teaching hiragana to kids had a characters name that was mostly written in hiragana spell the \"ri\" in her name as リ, but I get that that could just be a stylistic choice since it's a name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo is this an aesthetic thing, or does it change the emotion in how something's said or something? (I don't mean writing irl by the way, I mean like how things will be written in different ways in fiction to convey things. I'm talking like I'm thinking everyone's gonna not know what I mean, but I'm weird and overly clearify things I'm saying all the time, I don't know why, plus it's almost 4 AM and I can't think or type really good right now.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a stupid question lol",

A Japanese/English exchange between /r/newsokur and /r/LearnJapanese is being held now will run all weekend long.\n \nThis is for people who: \n \n• Want to practice Japanese but don’t have a good place to do it \n\n• Can barely speak Japanese but don’t care and want to challenge themselves \n\n• Those who already are pretty good at the language but just want to chat \n\n• Used to be good at Japanese but have been feeling like their abilities have fallen off recently\n\n• People who want to ask questions to Japanese people about their language or culture \n\n• Simply want to engage in an international exchange with native Japanese speakers.\n\nTo anyone who wants to use Japanese, please join!\n \nThink of /r/Newsokur as if Japan had a subreddit. The front page is any kind of post of any subject. Sometimes they want to use English but don’t have a good enough opportunity. Same thing for the users here. So, we’re doing this co-op to facilitate a mutually beneficial outcome.\n \nWith that, we have following two threads:\n \n• /r/LearnJapanese \"English only thread\" (This thread) Everyone makes conversation in English about whatever they want. Hobbies, daily life, questions about grammar, whatever you want can be talked about. Try to keep in mind the English level of who you’re talking to, and don’t use a high amount of slang \n \n• /r/newsokur \"Japanese only thread\" ([Located here](https://www.reddit.com/r/newsokur/comments/9hnj6w/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%A7%E4%BC%9A%E8%A9%B1%E3%81%97%E3%82%88%E3%81%86_language_exchange_with_rlearnjapanese/)) This will be the thread for us, a place to go practice Japanese. Same as above, they will be trying to use friendly Japanese with us, and will be waiting there for us to speak about whatever we want to speak about. Take this opportunity to ask Japanese people all the questions you’ve been wanting to ask.\n \nWe organized this event so that we can learn vocabulary and grammar from each other through simple everyday conversation. The main point is just setting up two threads, and past that there will be no guidelines for required conversation content at all!\n \nIt’ll be a lot of fun, and practice is one of the best ways to get better, so get out there and use some Japanese!\n \nThe threads will be up and stickied all weekend, so please keep checking in on them.\n \n\n",

Before and after classes the kids will often run up to me at my desk and start playing with my hair or asking me random stuff.\n\nLately they've been talking about the same stuff so I decided to put that time to better use and bring a light novel I'm reading, with my unknown words highlighted in them. Today a group of 6th grade girls came up and wanted to hang out so I showed them some recent highlights from the book I was reading and asked 「これ何て意味ですか？」 \n\nWith interest and enthusiasm, they described every word I didn't know to me! And their explanations were good, simple Japanese explanations that stuck in my head. There were 2 out of about 12 words they didn't know at all, and 6 that they had to think about/ask eachother about. That made me feel really good about my reading level lol, at least I can say I know about as much as a 6th grader.\n\nIf any of you happen to be ALTs or work with Japanese children, try bringing things to ask your kids about! It can be a fun way to build bonds *and* further your study goals!",

We could use people of really any skill level, either for content translation, data sorting or to help program certain features.\n\nCurrently considering distribution based on contribution to the project. \n\nAbout the Project:\n\nIn a nutshell, this project parses Japanese text and creates hover over and on-click events for both vocab and grammar.  Each word/grammar piece is linked to a card in your vocab and grammar decks.  If a card is due to be reviewed it shows up blue and you can click on it to do the review while reading the sentence.  \n\nThe goal is to expand my deck for sample sentences and continue development to be able to find level appropriate sentences, including audio, content to shift the focus from flipping single word cards to reading in context language while being able to review vocab and grammar based on SRS.\n\nI currently have a deck of 20,000 words each with native audio, images, sample sentences, ranked by three different frequency of use systems, tagged for chapters of major learning books, etc.  \n\nUsing subs2srs I've created over 100,000 sample sentences with native audio (average quality is pretty low though, have ideas on how to improve it.)\n\nHigh quality grammar deck with sample sentences.\n\nMost of the sentence parser add-on is complete, still working through some grammar patterns to be able to detect.  \n\nLogging a lot of hours on this and hired someone to do some of the more difficult programming, could really use some help.  I know that if we pool our time resources we can develop very high quality content to apply to a very useful add-on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

If not, is there some sort of website storing official Japanese subs sources in txt files as scripts or something like that? Lastly, is there something like that for Japanese tv shows / drama / anime / movies in which I can find official (Japanese) scripts for them?\n\n Thanks for reading all of this, if you have any sort of information / tip you’d like to share with me, I’d be glad to read it (literally anything could help me).  \n \n\nThanks again &amp; have a nice day!",

I'm not super beginner level (I know how to count money, tell the time, ask where something is, etc...) but it's mostly \"recipe\" stuff suited for generic street conversation.\n\nEven if it doesn't work out I'll continue to learn it anyways like I've been, so it would be helpful to know where I can find some of this stuff.

And although some meanings will be easy to guess from context, many won't. Most won't. I might be able to guess 20%, but the next time I see the word the chances I'll recall it are even lower...\n\nI assume it'd take at least 6 times of seeing a word I can accurately guess, in various contexts and with furigana at least 2\\~3 of those times, before it \"sticks\". And as you get higher level, the chances of an unknown word appearing that frequently at the right spaced interval are so incredibly low.\n\nHow are you guys consistently learning new vocabulary? Do you look up frequently? About how frequently? After you've read a certain amount do you go back and look up words you've marked? Then after that never look at it again?\n\nI'd really like to know you all's process.\n\nEDIT: i should've been more clear. I already do read. I just SRS the words I come across while reading that I don't know. I asked because I'm not aware of a way to consistently learn multiple words a day and have them stick, without doing \\*something\\* with those words after encountering them.",

I recently wanted to pick up writing, and looking around, RTK seems to be a pretty nice resource to learn writing, although a lot of people don't seem to like it because it doesn't actually teach kanji. His promise of \"demystifying\" kanji isn't all too useful to me: I'm an American Born Chinese, and I know a decent amount of vocab so I'm pretty used to kanji. I'm not sure if the goals of RTK are very useful to be except, of course, being able to write. \n\nMy question is: Is RTK still the way to go to systematically learn to write all the characters given all that? Are there any other resources that lean more towards pure rote memorization? That seems to be what I excel at.\n\nThanks a bunch!",

It looks pretty fun!\n\nEDIT: I'm currently working on a (very) rough translation.

It's pretty rough but I think I got the gist. All corrections appreciated.\n\nEDIT3: part two\n\nr/learnjapanese is a subreddit for students of the Japanese language. It's used for various questions on topics like ways to remember everyday kanji and grammar. But, that sub doesn't have many occasions to actually use Japanese and recently, there have been subs like \"今日の昼食は何にしました？\"  where fellow students were using Japanese. Seems like even they don't have any occasions to speak Japanese! Even in r/newsokur we hear things like \"I want to use English because I have a hard time using reddit\"\n\n- r/learnJapanese English only thread\nEveryone can exchange greetings and chat about interrests and ask any questions they like.\n\n-r/newsokur Japanese only thread\nStudents of Japanese will comment in Japanese. And people will respond using the apropriate level of Japanese. (Standard, middle school equivalent kanji usage should be fine. Best to avoid difficult internet slang)\n\nRules about conversation topics will not apply but ONLY in these language exchange threads! (I hope I read this part right :S)\n\nThe r/learnJapanese mods are interrested and want to try out this experiment. \n",

Something I could pop on my phone easily to revise during my flight, whether it's an offline app or document or whatever. I already have duolingo and other stuff but it's all very general. Thanks!",
