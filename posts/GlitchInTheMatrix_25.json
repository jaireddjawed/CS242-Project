A few years ago for a period of a few months I would be driving along in my car and I would sense that this one guy would be coming up in the next car. The car would be too far away for me to see who would be in it, and it was always a different car, but sure enough if I sensed him he would be in the car, I don't know this guy, he had Long hair and glasses and he would always wave. I thought maybe he had me confused with someone else until one day he drove by and I was in a different car and he still waved. So was he some weirdo who waves at every car? But even if he did, why would I sense him coming before I could see him? It happened maybe a handful of times then never again",

        "text": "I figured I'd share one of my other stories since my girlfriend has been nagging me to get answers from reddit.\n\nSo, this story happened back in high school, when my girlfriend and I first started dating. We had the same woodworking class and we had loved to try to make the better project and it was always a competition. So we always ended up being the risky pair in the class. One night, my parents let her sleep over and it was the day before the class. And I had a dream where I was using the band saw and it snagged on my jacket and cut my arm open. The next morning, I woke up and told her and she told me that she had a dream that she cut her hand open with a chisel. We head to school and put it off as just a weird coincidence. We get into woodworking and I immediately realize that the next part of my project requires me to use the band saw and hers requires her to use a bench chisel (she was way ahead of me). So we looked at each other and slowly crept towards our tasks. There were two people ahead of me in the line to use our only band saw and she was scouting the room for the sharpest bench chisel in the shop. We both got closer to using our objects when we heard a girl shriek. She had been using that sharp bench chisel and had sliced right into he flesh between her thumb and her index finger. Then, only seconds later, the guy in front of me shrieked as well. As he looked to find the source of the first scream, his sleeve had gotten caught in the blade and pulled his forearm into it. Panicking, I switched of the machine and pulled him away from it. My girlfriend and I had looked at each other from across the room as if we had superpowers. It may not be a perfect glitch but it's still freaky. ",

We all put our backpacks in a pile near the door, and when the bell rang, we all would pick up our backpacks and head for the front of the school where our parents would pick us up. It was a huge thing. Hundreds of students would be sitting out there, cars would be lined up across the block, and there would be at least 5 or 6 teachers directing everything.\n\nSo one day after music class, the bell rings and we all start picking up our backpacks like usual. We walk through the hallway and I head outside. I'm the only one out there, apart from one girl. No teachers, no cars, nothing. The girl eventually gets picked up and I'm out there for a short while by myself. Eventually my mom pulls up in the van. I step into the car. She asks where everyone is and I say I don't know. We leave without a thought.\n\nTo this day, I can't explain it. The dashboard on my mom's van showed the correct time so I wasn't early. I didn't skip an event of some sort because no teacher got onto me the next day (they kept very strict accountability of us). That day, nobody else in my school except for one person waited out front that day. They all decided to go somewhere else.",

I was in elementary school. Probably around 3rd grade. I was playing tag with a group of other kids. Suddenly, everything was going in slow motion. My running was like one of those dreams where you're trying to run but you just aren't moving fast at all. Everyone else was going in slow motion too. \n\nThe only thing i can think to explain it is that it was windy at the same time that it occurred. So maybe it was the wind. But at the time it seemed to be a separate effect from the wind so I've always wondered about it. \n\nI remember I tried asking one of the other kids about it, and I think he listened and maybe agreed but I didn't feel he actually understood or experienced it. That part of the memory has faded quite a bit though. \n\nAnyway, that's the weirdest thing I've experienced afaik. ",

When we got there, we could see the shape of a black dog stuck in the gate that lead to the rooms upstairs. Now, this gate was metal, and the bars couldn’t have been more than an inch wide from each other. This gate rattled as the dog struggled to get through, and then it slipped past it. The black dog ran up the stairs and to the right- and we could see that it was the size of a wolf. Then it ran up another set of stairs out of sight. The next morning we decided to explore up the other set of stairs and it lead to the roof of the building. There was a dog bowl and some food. What I can’t understand to this day is how the dog got through the gate. My little hand barely made it through.

There was nothing in the air there, and we're in an open field hitting at a driving range, so I have no clue how it even hit something or IF it even hit something. I doubt it hit something because 1. the ball was in the middle of the air not near anything, and 2. it couldn't have hit a ball because I was at the side of the driving range in an area where no one could've possibly shot a ball besides me.

        "text": "This post is about the Netflix show, 'The OA'. Spoilers lie ahead so beware if you haven't finished the show. I figure it's basically impossible to discuss the show without revealing aspects of the show. Still, I'm more interested in discussion the themes of this show more than the specific details.  \n\nWith that out of the way..... I just finished watching the show and I couldn't stop thinking of this sub. I thought of all the amazing stories I've read on here of people experiencing their own death but then glitching into an alternate reality / parallel dimension where they did not die (perhaps because it is the path of least resistance). I've been fascinated with quantum suicide ever since I learned about it from this sub. So many of the stories on this sub were so powerful to me and really stuck with me and I always thought these topics would be incredible topics to create shows or movies around. I think 'The OA' does some really interesting things around the idea of quantum suicide, although it is dancing around many other themes as well and I guess in the end we still are pretty unsure exactly what is going on.   \n\nAnyway, I'm just curious if you have seen the show and what this subs thoughts are about how it plays with the concepts of quantum suicide and how it may have connected to your ideas about the matrix as a whole. If you have experienced a NDE, do you relate to the experiences in the show at all?",

As we approached where our team met, we walked into a group having a similar conversation about waking up and going through most of the day thinking it was Thursday.\n\nSeveral other people on the team, from grades 9-12 mentioned this as well at various points and a few other strange things happen - someone showed up late, for instance, because they had a doctors appointment that was supposed to be Thursday. We even had a discussion at the end of the day in the locker room about how eerie it was - like something from a sci-fi movie. We tried to remember what had happened the day before but were only coming up with two days worth of memories - Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThis was not a day during a short week, no snowdays, no changes in extracurricular schedules or class schedules etc. We (at least the girls on the team) were all top students and ruled out those kind of basic reasons for why we would have all had that experience. Me and a nerdy friend even discussed the Star Trek episode Cause and Effect because that's what it reminded us of.\n\nWe never really talked about it again and I've never experienced anything like it since.",

So I looked around and when I got back to the place I started looking at there was an army soldier figurine about 3 inches tall standing there upright. Right in front of the the army generals tombstone. Then a few days later me and my brother were walking around in the first few feet of we're our backyard turned to woods when we found a little metal box like the size of a ring box. Again being curios children we ran over and picked it up proud of our find. We took it out of the woods and into the sun to examine it when it started to open. Freaked out we dropped and watched it. It opened like a ring box. And on the inside there was a ring. We're you would find a diamond sticking up was a little eye I'm not sure if it was real or not but it was pretty small. That was enough for one day so me and my brother ran out. The next day me and my brother were wondering about it and went back to were it was that we dropped it and it was gone we looked around for a solid 20 minutes but to no avail.\n\nBefore posting this I asked my brother about because I know younger children memory's arnt always real but my brother described the exact same thing I did so I know it had to of been \"real\"",

I couldnt remember exactly when, but i vividly remembered him telling me that a man had called him about the truck and he had to call him back. It must have been a dream.\n\nWhen he picked me up at 1pm the first thing i asked was whether or not he had called the guy back about his truck? \n\nHe looked at me confused. I told him he had told me about the call. \n\nConfused he checks his phone log and sure enough theres a missed call at 8am from a number we didnt recognize, he didnt remember his phone ringing, said he didnt receive a call all day but sure enough the call is logged.\n\nHe calls the number back and its a man who wants to come buy his truck tomorrow.\n\nThe weird thing is that i hadnt spoken to him since 5am. Even if he had remembered getting a call, it was missed and they never spoke, and since it was at 8am there was no way i would have known.\n\nSpooky",

        "text": "Okay so I'm going to go ahead and number them and explain them as best as possible. \n\n1. I was around 4 years old during this first occurrence. One of my first real memories I can recall... I was in my home staring at myself standing by my father, I was peering from the top of a doorway thinking to myself, \"This is her, this..is..me.\" Almost instantaneously after that my vision fixes to me standing by my father. I look up at him and then to the wall. I continue my life from here...\n\n2. Wishing people would get in car accidents who have hurt me, they get into accidents the same night. \nThis happened to two of my exes, one who cheated on me while I was living with him. The night he broke up with me and dropped me off at my mother's home, I wished he'd get in a car accident. He rolled (3 times) his soft-top convertible into a ditch and should have died. He survived. \nThe other is my son's biological father who took me out to a park at 1 AM, displayed violent behavior, I had to hide until he left and gave up looking for me. I came home crying and a dirty mess, I wished the same on him... I get a call a few hours later and a car spun out in front of his truck, hitting him head on. He survived, was just very bruised.. \n\n3. Dream I had when I was in middle school that a kid in my class broke his arm that night before I went to bed. (this was in the early 2000's so no cell phone/social media to influence my mind. also I did not know him personally) I go to school the next morning asking where he was since he wasn't in Home Room starting at 8:00AM. A few kids told me he had broken his arm the night before, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to sound crazy. \n\nIf I can remember any more I'll edit this post. These occurrences honestly scare the hell out of me. Maybe it's crazy coincidences BUT this is all to real to feel like anything else. \n\nAlso the car accidents DID happen. Ex1 had a busted scull and showed me pictures of the damage after we were back on speaking terms. \nEx2 saw me the day after he got out of the hospital. \n\n",

        "text": "This is honesty such a strange thing. It gives me such an uneasy feeling. So, if anyone has any reasonable explanations I'm open to them. \n\n\nI've always been very close to my grandparents. They live right next door and as a kid I'd go over there nearly every day. As I think every grandma does, mine had an abundance of photo albums that we'd look through every now and again and discuss the family. Through these discussions, I learned things. My Grandpa is an only child and his mother only had two brothers. His father and uncles all passed long before I was born and his mother also passed shortly after. As far as I knew (and had been told) he was the last of his family. So, you can imagine my surprise when one day a cousin of his showed up. \n\n\nI was only about 9 at the time and I'm 17 now, just to give reference for the future time frame. I was chillin' at their house when a woman showed up. She was maybe 10 years older than my grandfather, if that. She was dressed like how I'd imagine a Bristish nanny would dress, honestly, lol. Dark blue bucket hat, thick glasses, bright red pea-coat, black skirt. Kind of irrelevant but I'm just saying I remember this *really* clearly.\n\n\nI remember she came right into the house and sat next to my grandpa. They didn't address each other like distant relatives or like they hadn't seen each other in a while; they jumped right into talking and banter. I asked my grandma who it was and she said it was my grandpa's cousin. (He also confirmed this). Even at that time I was confused because by everything I'd ever heard he had no living relatives. (And now that I think of it this woman was in none of the photo albums.) I'm about 90% sure her name was Joanne or something like that, something with a J. She honestly didn't pay much mind to me and we didn't even talk more than a greeting. \n\n\nFor some reason (and I know how this is gonna sound) I felt like I shouldn't be there. Maybe it was just because I was shy and wanted to give them privacy, but I remember feeling like I just wasn't supposed to be there. So, I left, and I never really paid much mind to it. I didn't mention it to my parents at the time because it didn't seem important. I was confused but assumed I missed something and besides, they had a lot of old friends. \n\n\nBut the more time passes the stranger it seems. She was never mentioned before that day or ever since. She has never came up in any family stories, the family tree project I did in school, in photo albums, nothing. I recently mentioned \"grandpa's cousin\" and everyone looked at me like I had grown a second head right in front of them. I even described her and said both grandparents called her a cousin but it didn't register to anybody. \n\n\nI'm positive I didn't dream this or get mixed up. I distinctly remember her and being perplexed by this random cousin. So what the hell?\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm fairly new here so I apologize if this story doesn't quite fit the glitch category.  I can move it if you think that's best. Anyway my story is about a weird intuition my mom had about me. I might go into needless details here but that's just how I am.\n\nMy parents live in the rural north west and I lived with them in my early twenties. I was probably around 19 or 20 when this happened, so mid 2000s. It was mid winter, lots of snow at my parents log house, and as usual I slept in so when I woke up I was home alone. My dad was out, brother at work, I knew my mom had gone into town (15 miles away) to grocery shop. I needed to build up the fire in the woodstove but saw there wasn't any wood next to it. In my pajamas and barefeet I went outside onto the porch to grab wood from the stack a few feet from the door. Our labs were inside and I didn't want them to go outside just to bark at snow falling off trees so I shut the door behind me. I got the wood and tried to go inside but realized that the door had been locked all along. \nWe don't have any close neighbours and we were far from town so we never locked the doors, but having been from a large city before our country life my mom was still in the habit of locking the doors before bed but she always unlocks them in the morning to let cats/dogs in/out. The locks are the kind that when locked, they can still be opened from the inside. So I didn't notice they were locked when exiting the house. I panicked at this point because it was cold, maybe 10°F , and I had thin pajama pants, a t shirt, and no shoes. Stupid, I know but I had spent my entire life in an area that never got cold so it wasn't habit yet to \"gear up\"  before walking out the door. The dogs in the house were jumping up on the door wanting out. Since the handles are levers I tried to get one of the dogs to jump on the door and hopefully use the weight of her paws to pull the handle down. No such luck. \n\nI saw my dad's work boots at the end of the porch and slipped them on for some protection and hobbled around the house to every door and window hoping for a way in. There is a daylight basement and wrap around porch so a total of 4 doors to try and 7 windows to check if anyone left cracked open (nope). I knew there was a spare key but my mom tends to move things and forget to tell people so all the spare key hiding areas were coming up empty. I was on the verge of tears at this point thinking of hypothermia and losing my toes so I walked back to the front door and huddled to wait. I had been outside for maybe 20 minutes at this point and remembered my dads beat up recreational truck was parked nearby. I knew he would have left the keys in the vehicle and figured I could warm up in there until someone came home although it was old and I didnt know if the heater even worked. I was making my way to the truck when I heard a car turning up on the road and make its way down our driveway and then I saw my mom turn the corner and pull up. I told her what had happened and she got this weird look on her face and explained to me that she was heading \"up the hill\" to get home when she felt this sudden gut feeling that I was in trouble and needed her, so she booked it home, snowy road be damned (my mom is a slow snow driver so this was a big deal), thus saving all my fingers and toes from turning black and falling off. \nHave any of you felt this kind of intuition? Haven't had anything like that happen since.",

I was laying in bed, trying to get to sleep early since I was to wake up, go to work, and then make a 3 hour drive to see a friend. As I was laying in bed I was over come with this horrible feeling, almost like a panic attack. I just had this feeling that something was wrong but I just didn't know what. I had never experienced something like this, I was so on edge that there was something wrong but, but for the life of me, could not figure out what is was. After a few hours I was finally able to calm myself down enough to fall asleep.\n\nThe next morning and go to work, I come home and quickly gather my things and making sure I was prepared for my trip. Everything seemed in place. I had packed everything on my list and knew I was good to go. I get on the road and completely forget about the night before (thanks to wonders of audiobooks and a stressful day at work).\n\nAbout 1 hour into my drive I come to a very busy high way where I have been before and I know it is pretty much a shit-show during rush hour. I know that merging onto this highway is quite a pain and it is normal to sit and wait. Finally, I am at the head of the line waiting for my turn when the lady behind me did not see that I had yet to go and rear-ended me. I know, this is a pretty common occurrence, a very mild car accident, and nothing to worry about but for me, this was the first accident I have been in since I started driving 6 years ago. \n\nWe pull over do the normal insurance exchange and finally drive off. I end up having to pull over because my bumper was flopping around and definitely needed to secure it before I continued my trip. Once I pulled over into the nearest shopping center, and all the adrenaline had gone from my system, I had the \"ah-ha!\" moment. I felt an instant relief and KNEW this why I had the panic attack before.\n\nIt was like I knew something was going to happen. Although, in the grand scheme of things, it was a mild accident and pretty insignificant at that but just extremely weird circumstances surrounding it.",

For every December, we have a weekend where we have a lock-in starting at 8pm and ending at 7am. I brought my phone, my DS, a white-elephant gift, and some chargers for my phone and DS. I have a 2DS, so this means it won't fold. I bought a $20 case for it (can hold 3 games not in the DS) and is cloth with a zipper to hold the DS. I have 7 games, so I can have 4 with me at all times. Whenever I have a game cartridge not in my DS or the DS case, I ALWAYS make sure it is safely placed inside the original game cartridge case (what you buy it in). So I brought Pokemon Omega Ruby, SSMB4, Animal Crossing:New Leaf, and Pokemon Moon in the DS itself. I made sure my other 3 games were in their corresponding cartridge cases, double checked what I was taking, and made sure I took nothing else so it could not be stolen. This means I checked twice to make sure I would take no extra games. But here is the glitch.\nWhen i first opened my DS case I pulled out my 2DS but I then noticed something else. I pulled it out, and it was my Pokemon Y game cartridge, which had been in its game case for at least 3 months. \nWhat the heck?\nI had been hanging out with 3 other scouts with their 2DS' and 3DS' with them, and they all witnessed the glitch also. I asked if they had lost their Pokemon Y game cartridges, but the ones who had the game all had theirs in their DS cartridge holder cases. Simon (I traded some Pokemon with him afterwards) told me to see if it was my game. I inserted it into the cartridge slot, opened the save file, and guess what? It was at my previously saved point. I still have no idea how this happened.\n\n\ntl;dr, I found a DS game in my case which should have been at home in the same spot for 3 months.\n\n\n\n\nNinja edit: We have the lock-ins on the most available time during late November and early December, I meant that it was November last weekend.",

When I looked at my call history, it said I had called Sam about five times in the middle of the night. I had also called our other friend who we'll call Dave, that call said it lasted a few minutes. I had absolutely no memory of any of this, and to top it off I had gone to bed extremely mad at both Sam and Dave (for stupid teenager reasons). I started freaking out that I did something in my sleep because I was mad at them (I had a history of sleep talking and walking but never something like this) so I texted Dave asking if we had talked the night before. He said no. Later that day I asked Sam and he also denied calling me or having missed calls from me. I was convinced there was a glitch or I was insane. Turns out, Dave's boyfriend who was also Sam's roommate got locked out, came to my room, and used my phone to call his roommate and boyfriend. When they realized I didn't remember it they decided to pretend it didn't happen to freak me out. \n\nTl;dr I thought there was a glitch in the matrix but it turns out my friends are just major assholes. Still doesn't explain why I have no memory of any of it...but that's a different issue. ",

        "text": "I was five years old and it was the first day of K-5 at this public school close to my home. It was the first day of school, and the two teachers looking over the class were new to their jobs, so we all ran outside to play since they wanted to get comfortable with the students. \n\nI remember leaving the group of students playing together, and climbing up this large \"jungle gym\". Shortly after, the teachers started to round up the kids to go back inside, so I jumped down and followed them into the classroom. Everything was alright, we started a lesson, then we were dismissed. I went back home, took a bath, ate dinner, and went to bed.\n\nI dreamed about climbing the jungle gym again, but this time a few of my friends had followed. I was hanging upside down when the teachers began calling the students, but this time I lost my grip on the bars and fell to the ground. I closed my eyes and felt nothing, assuming at the time that it was a bad dream and that I needed to wake up. I tried waking myself up, but when I opened my eyes, my elbow was beside my face. I'd fallen and broken my left arm in four places: two places on my wrist, two places on my elbow. I spent a week in ICU because the fall nearly caused my elbow to sever the main artery.\n\nI vividly remember telling my teachers that \"they needed to wake me up\", but they'd all ignored me. After a week in ICU, I had recovered enough to go back to school after hours to get private lessons until I got my cast off. The day I got back, she began the lesson I remembered being taught previously, before I went back home and fell asleep. I told her she had already taught this to me, and she insisted that she hadn't. Ignoring my attempts to explain, she continued the lesson, and life went on.\n\nI'm about to be 18 now, and whenever I think about it, I begin having severe existential crises. I tell myself that my brain had sent me into a dream-like state where the day continued because of the stress being put on my body during the initial impact. For some reason, I have trouble believing this to be the case, even though I'm typically a very logical person. I question this reality a lot, and I still feel like I'm asleep, just waiting to wake up. I don't know how I feel about it in either case.\n\nEdit: Spacing. Thank you /u/Agret",

Well, I was already depressed, just not as badly as I am now. I read on here something about being immortal by jumping universes every time you die, so you dont actually die, just in the universe that you were already in. I think that might have happened to me. If i'm dead, I know when and how it happened. Like I said earlier, I've been depressed, I know this is gonna just make me sound like some 12 year old edgelord, but I started cutting. It wasn't my first time, I did it when I was younger, but stopped for a long time because of how stupid it was. I made one smallish cut on my arm, and then I made another one, except this one was bigger and deeper. I bled for a long time, and it was really painful. But after it stopped bleeding, I just didn't feel anytning, no pain, no sadness. I dont feel sad, just empty. I don't really know how to explain it very accurately. I just feel like I had killed myself that night, and now I'm dead but I just don't have proof of that. The people reading this, you guys, could all just be a figment of my imagination, I could just be some dead girl lying in a casket right now, hallucinating everything.

        "text": "I'm sure many people have had a Deja Vu experience. I have been having these experiences since I can remember, which would be about the age of 5. I am now 17. I feel like my dreams and reality are somehow connected but other than my experiences I have no proof. One dream for instance was a dream in which I was in my private school, I was looking around the class, then outside to see a girl swinging, and then my teacher called my name \"Brandon!\" and the teacher repeated herself until I woke up to my mother calling my name at my house in sync with the dream until I opened my eyes. This doesn't seem too weird until the same day everything happens, and I know it is happening and recall the dream and I count everything, the looking around, the girl on the swing and then the teacher called my name.\n I was 6 when this event occurred. \n\nAnother time, (can't remember the age except I was around 11-14 yrs old) I was sitting on my bunk bed at around 11PM, reading something on my laptop. I was tired, but I continued to scour the internet until I looked at my wall, and I swear to you, I just blinked once, but as soon as my eyelids opened from the blink, it was daytime, and at first I thought the lights turned on but I looked outside my window and saw the sun shining and heard the birds chirping and even my father making something in the kitchen but also I was in the same position as when I blinked, my earphones were still in my ears, my laptop was sleeping but was still in the same position and I wasn't leaning on anything and was sitting with crossed legs. \n\nLastly, (I've had more but I'm going to keep the stories to a minimum of three each post.) these Deja Vu experiences have become stranger as I have grown up, the main difference is as soon as the experience begins I know it's happening because of some kind of trigger flashback like when my mom says a word and I know I am \"seeing again\" and I try to remember what happens next or change it. Here is a true example (You'll have to take my word for it): \n*Sitting in kitchen\n*Dad says something to mother (TRIGGER)\n*Now know that Deja Vu is occurring\n*Sees more things happen exactly as they did in the dream\n*Think to myself that now someone is going to come through the hallway to the right\n*Nothing happens\n*Realize that my thoughts also transfer from the dream\n*In the dream I remember thinking of the dream\n*And in \"reality\" thinking of the dream, and how the me in the dream thought of me thinking of the dream.\n*Then it stops, and as if someone has programmed me to stop overthinking it, I continue whatever task I was doing before the TRIGGER, for example, eating cereal. lol, now that is some Rick and Morty, Back to the Future, Matrix, Inception ridiculousness and I almost couldn't actually explain it.\n\nThis has happened at least 4 times in my life, but all around the age of 14-17. It's like I attempt to change my vision but in doing \nso, I am fulfilling my vision in the first place and I know that I am doing that but also DON'T know that I am doing it. Like I am omnipresent but also of average sentience. I know it is EXTREMELY weird but it almost doesn't phase me in the least. I can predict the future until the \"reality\" me realizes that I am realizing and then it all goes down some infinite shit hole.\n\nI don't know what this is, but I am not scared just completely mind-boggled.\n\n",

My cat was standing like a human being on the steps that led down into our sunken living room. What was so strange about the living room drapes were drawn and there was nothing for her to look at.  Her body was facing forward and her head was an angle facing my direction.  I just froze and waited for her to come down onto all four feet, but she didn't.  After about half a minute, I walk down and across the living room over to her and stepped up on the step she was on,  there was nothing like a window or anything to keep her interest.  In fact, she didn't move or look at me.  When about a minute had passed she slowly turned her head and looked at me with a blank expression, and turned her head back the was, toward the entryway.  After about another 45 seconds or so, she got on all fours and acted normal.  Since then I have seen the Amazing Standing Cat video on Youtube, but that cat was looking at birds out a window.  She was rock solid and didn't even sway.  I left and went shopping, I had told no one.  When I got back my daughter was scared because she had heard footsteps in the entryway and thought it was me.  The footsteps she heard had hard soles, she was confused because I always wear tennis shoes.  What was my cat looking at?  How long had she been standing like an before I saw her?  That was only time in 16 years she ever did it.  Has anyone else had something like that happen to them? Paranormal or Glitch?",

Struck up a conversation with the guy waiting next to me, just about ordinary things, what we did for work, when we moved to the area, etc. \n\nWe got on the train together. Eventually he asked me for my number so we could get a drink that night. He took out his phone and handed it to me so I could put my number in, and he then called me so I would have his number too. We parted ways. I didn't hear from him that night, but I shrugged it off. The next day I decided to text him. My text bounced back with a message that the number was a landline and couldn't accept text messages. Huh? But I'd watched him call me from his cell phone. Puzzled, I decided to try calling. It didn't ring. Just flipped me to an automated message from Verizon. \n\nLater that same day, after having brunch with some friends, I noticed that I had a missed call. It was from him. No message. I tried texting again and got the same text back that it was a landline. \n\nI was never able to reach him and he never contacted me again, nor have I seen him waiting for the train, even though he told me he lived in the area.",

        "text": "Just over 9 years ago, I began going to my second high school. It was quite some distance from home, so my mum drove me there, making sure to drive the exact route I'd need to take to get to the nearest bus stop. I distinctly remember the road the school was on, was wooded and made a gradual left turn, and when we reached the school, it was on the left. So I knew I had to turn right to get to the bus stop.\n\nThe day ends, and I make my way out of the school, turning right out of the gates. Except the road is different now. It turns the right way, but there's an incline and a bridge over a motorway. The road also ends in a T junction, and there's only the nearby airport in front of me. Things only get more confusing when I turn around and walk the other way, only to find it's the same road from that morning. It was like the school switched to the other side of the road.\n\nI ended up missing my bus and walking home. I couldn't explain it to my mother as anything other than 'I got lost'.",

        "text": "When I was younger, my life wasn't great. I got bullied a lot in school, and my dad was an abusive cunt.  I recently recalled a faint memory, of a date carved in the side of my bookshelf. I don't have that bookshelf anymore. I want to say the date was 1/21/06 but I'm not sure.\n\nI remember once I carved my name into a wooden dresser when I was four or five, and I got in huge trouble for it. Why would I do it again? What the hell happened that day, to make me want to carve a date into the bookshelf?\n\nI kept a paper journal from when I was eight until I was eighteen. I'm twenty one now. I found the journal, going through it thoroughly to try and find any dates around that time that seemed important. I couldn't find any, in fact the years of 2005-2008 were very scarce in entries.\n\nI remember I used to fantasize about time travel a lot back then, about going back in time and changing the past, with the intention of creating a better future. I can't remember anything, but my young self seemed to think that day was more important than any other, to carve into that bookshelf, with no context. \n\nI can sort of remember, when carving it, that I knew I would forget what happened that day, but I thought remembering the date was important. I wonder why I chose not to write more there, or why I didn't journal it. I wish, for the life of me, I could remember what it was. \n\nI almost feel like a conscious effort has been made to keep me from finding that information. My father abandoned the bookshelf when we moved like six years ago. My journal seems to be missng some pages.\n\nIt's just so out of character for me, and I know tht I'm the one who carved it. I'm sure it's just a series of coincidences, but it just feels so odd.",
