It is a really neat watch but I noticed something strange and I am trying to decide if I need to return it.   \n\n\nThe bezel on the watch seems a little loose? I am not quite sure how to describe it. Loose might be an overexaggeration. It does not rattle around or anything like that; however, if I push down on it or push it from side to side, it does have a little give to it and it moves probably about 1mm or less. I am not rotating the bezel, just pushing it laterally (towards or away from the crown) or vertically (down towards the case-back). It does return to it's original position and almost feels like it is floating and supported by a spring or something.  \n\n\nI would rather not return it as I have been waiting a long time for this; however, this was a big purchase for me and I want to make sure everything is working properly!  \n\n\nIf you own a Marathon GSAR, is this something you have noticed? Am I making a big deal out of nothing?",

I started my watch journey early last year after studying a few of my friends who had dive watches.\n\n**Act 1 - Virginity**\n\nAfter hitting some key milestones last year like securing my first full-time gig and getting some much needed promotions I started with my Oris Divers 65 in 40mm. It had all the bells and whistles that a first time watch buyer would want. With my 7 inch wrist, it had a 48mm lug to lug, unique case design, domed sapphire crystal and a beautiful gilt tinted hour and seconds hands that reminded me so much of the black bay 58 and at the time, since I couldn't afford $5,600 AUD and wouldn't ever dream of spending that money anyway, I stuck with the Oris and is a brand that I fall more and more in love with everyday. But, yep, I popped my cherry and got into the watch world.\n\n**Act 2**\n\nHowever, I soon realised I need a beater or at least something more durable to go diving with. Whilst the Oris 65 has 100m water resistance, it was my first watch and honestly didn't feel like i could go take on the world with it. The bronze bezel also became another reason why I didn't want to over patina the watch as well.\n\nHence, I binged more Teddy Baldasarre (who deserves more respect I think) and landed on a Seiko SPB143. It's a 40mm watch but wears so much more smaller than the Oris (and heavier). This watch has actually been the watch I've worn the most. It's gone diving with me off the coast of North Vietnam and survived a lot of sewage water whilst kayaking.\n\n**Finale**\n\nI got the call a few weeks ago for the BB58 and at last, I've attained my grail watch and for the next few years, it certainly will be the only luxury I'll be purchasing.\n\nIt combines the versatility and wearability of the Seiko SPB143 into a far more lighter and compact case design with the gilt markings of the Oris and improved dial finishing.

I really like the way it looks, but saw that it's quartz. I was wondering if there's a similar watch to this but maybe mechanical. I was thinking of getting an SSC813 Panda Seitona or Ghost Alpinist (can't seem to find any available), but this caught my eye. Any suggestions are appreciated (along this watch or even like the Panda Seitona). Thanks!",
