Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.\n\nSome questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.\n\nHere are the ground rules:\n\n* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.\n* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.\n* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.\n* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.\n* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.\n* Academic secondary sources are preferred. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).\n* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678294859.0},{"title":"Ancient Romans collected incredibly expensive tables made from African citrus wood \u2014 a craze called, \"mensarum insania.\" Cicero paid a million sestertii for one, \u2014 enough to purchase a huge estate.

'communicated' their expression as such?","author":"Geert_Kompjee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11q4zxz\/gbessi_a_mendeman_who_acted_like_a_woman_told_the\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\n(I previously posted my question on AskAnthropology, there someone suggested I try it here as well.)\n\nThis is quite a specific question, so I start with some context. I have done historical research on the impact of the local context (Mende agency, missionary presence, British colonial administration) on the fieldwork of the Dutch social anthropologist Sjoerd Hofstra among the Sierra Leonean Mende (1934-1936). Hofstra\u2019s archive contains fieldnotes on his encounters with Gbessi, a \u2018Mende-man who acted like a woman\u2019, and the dream which, according to Gbessi\u2019, led him to his distinctive gender expression.\n\nGbessi travelled around Sierra Leone\u2019s Southern Province (British Protectorate) as a masked Bundu-dancer of the Sandei-\u2018secret-society\u2019, the female equivalent of the Poro-society. He had \u2018quite the voice of a woman\u2019, \u2018walked slowly and hesitantly like a woman\u2019, \u2018\\[made\\] on the whole the same movements and gestes\u2019 (gestures), and did work normally done by women, such as assisting in childbirth. Gbessi\u2019s mother had been the leader of a local Sandei-lodge. When Gbessi\u2019s mother died, she appeared to him in a dream, in which she told him where to find charms which would make him a gifted Bundu-dancer. Under the surface of a river he encountered non-ancestral spirits (*ngafei*), who indeed provided him with a charm. Yet, the spirits demanded that he would live the rest of his life as a woman, as men were not allowed to dance for the Sandei-society. After three days Gbessi found himself in his own house again.\n\nIn his fieldnotes, Hofstra writes that Gbessi already \u2018acted like a woman\u2019 before he ever dreamt of his mother, the charm and the non-ancestral spirits, suggesting that Gbessi sought to \u2018explain\u2019 a non-normative gender expression with the dream. It is unknown to me if Gbessi only told this story to Hofstra, as a European visitor with money and connections. However, Hofstra\u2019s Mende guides\/interlocutors Thomas Conteh and Samuel believed the story, and mentioned that they knew of more people like Gbessi: \u2018who are between men and women.\u2019 They also seemed somewhat afraid of Gbessi.\n\n**Question:** Is there more historical information on the way people like Gbessi (perhaps third gender?), related their gender expression to dreams (or \u2018explained\u2019 it in this way)? Perhaps in a broader West-African context? Was it necessary for them to communicate 'the cause' of their gender expression in a culturally meaningful way (dream with powerful spirits) in order to find acceptance in their society?\n\nPS: The background story of these encounters is quite interesting as well, as Gbessi was imprisoned by the Dodo-*ndomahei* (\u2018Paramount Chief\u2019) at the time. Some bathing Mende-women had supposedly seen Gbessi looking at them, against custom for a man. Hofstra, Conteh and Samuel questioned this narrative of the ndomahei, accused him of 'money-hunting'. Hofstra wondered if British sexual norms played a role here as well, as the mission increasingly made inroads into the Sierra Leonean Protectorate in the 1920s-1930s. Conteh and Samuel stated that the Dodo-women actually liked Gbessi. As they thought Gbessi's treatment and fine against \u2018native rules and feelings\u2019 they decided to free Gbessi and help him escape without paying his fine. Later, Gbessi told Hofstra that he had had a second dream, now with both the spirits and the Dutchman in it.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678699581.0},{"title":"In November of 1940, Soviet Officials and Axis Officials met each other to discuss the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the Axis Powers, what was the context of these talks?","author":"FromLuxorToEphesus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11qi1oa\/in_november_of_1940_soviet_officials_and_axis\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678733592.0},{"title":"Did the Romans have digestion problems after eating laying on their side?","author":"momentsofillusions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11qh8kd\/did_the_romans_have_digestion_problems_after\/","text":"It may be a silly question, but I thought about how nobles or wealthy people in Ancient Rome would eat dinner laying on their side.

However...\n\nfor one, wasn't Mussolini a former socialist, and, based on some of his rhetoric and policies, didn't he and the Italian Fascists, as leaders of Italy beginning in the 1920s, \\*actually implement and put in place\\* a lot of \\*very-restrictive\\* regulations on 'how to manage and run the economy', esp. on capitalists and corporate elites themselves (though, perhaps, not necessarily ridding them of \\*all\\* their wealth and\/or power\\*?  Also... I remember coming upon an article claiming that, among other things, at least one major historian likened old-school fascism of that time to, \"right-wing socialism\", funny enough.  Not to mention that, despite some \"lefties\" in countries like the US likening, say, corporate lobbies being \"too close\" to various politicians in our democracies as \"fascist\", the actual 'corporatism' Mussolini described was a much-more harmonious and controlled arrangement, per industry or 'societal grouping', formally managed by the gov't, in the end?  Not exactly 'the same' as \"private lobbyists for Citibank trying their damndest to bribe or 'buy' politicians with heavy campaign donations or doing their damndest to 'get more subsidies' while operating largely on their own nonetheless.\" And, finally, even in his Fascist days, I recall, if memory serves, Mussolini and his ilk, during their takeover of Italy, \"calling out\", to some degree, the \"greediest\" and\/or \"most-powerful\" of the private capitalists enabled by previous capitalist practice and 'lax' economic policy?\n\nAs concerns Nazi Germany, in spite of them, perhaps, in the early days of their 1930s campaigns for office- esp. legislative office- being something of an \"intentional sham\" to \"win support\" for a \\*secret, very-odious agenda\\*, didn't the Nazis also take control of much of the Germany economy, compared to the 'more liberal' Weimar Republic?  Or, at least, were, if nothing else, heavily-interventionist within said economy?  I also recall hearing about a 'leftist' German economist who left Germany when things got too risky, who published a book called \"The Vampire State.\"  Supposedly he analyzed 'Nazi control' of the German economy \\*and\\*, to some degree, \"received complaints\" from even big-businessmen within Germany that, \"The Nazis are choking us\", so to speak?  This would seem to be, to some degree, to be \"a tad contrary\" to the idea that capitalists, in the early days, 'supported fascism to shore-up their own corporate power'?\n\nThen again, it's also true, if memory serves, that the modern term \"privatization\" \\*actually came from German practices\\* of that like, I believe?  Furthermore, insofar as they \"abandoned\" whatever \"socialist promises\" they 'made to the people' in the early years of their runs for power, did the bulk of Nazis (National Socialists) really \"have almost no intentions or ideals of doing anything remotely-close to socialism, let alone an expanded welfare state\", or is it simply the case that, thanks to high-level leaders like Hitler and \\*their\\* racialist-genocidal agendas, the party was 'steered in the wrong direction', so to speak, in a big way?  W\/ those who were \"socialist or center-left\" being \"undermined\" in a lot of ways?\n\nAnd... to what extent did 'the capitalist class' \"actually fund and\/or support\", in a MAJOR WAY, the early Nazis and Italian Fascists??  \\*Is\\* there hard evidence that early Nazi originators like Hitler \"got the bulk of support and\/or funding\" \\*from\\* the capitalist class, or was more of their funding from semi-wealthy and\/or middle-class folks who were, to some degree, more \"ultraconservative\" in values outside of purely-economic concerns?  Maybe this seems a bit \"naive\", but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the notion that, \"Most of Hitler's and\/or Mussolini's early supporters who helped them get into power in a big way were actual corporate execs and high-level managers worth a lot of money\"?  Is it more of a \\*combination\\* of wealthy support, to some degree, with 'ultraconservative' semi-wealthy and middle-class folks \\*also\\* supporting them, which helped them get to power?  Were most capitalists really as \"diehard traditionalist\" and\/or reactionary, in those days, in both nations, as the implication would seem, or were they, in fact, only a tiny minority of actual supporters (the most-reactionary and\/or traditionalist among said capitalists, that is)?\n\nOverall, what was \"the essence\" of fascism, economically?  Can we say, with confidence, that it was simply, \"capitalism in decay\", per se, or is it a bit more complex?  Were policies of Italian Fascism and Nazi Germany simply \"so chaotic\", in terms of constantly changing, that there was a 'broad mix' of increased laxity \\*and\\* increased intervention, throughout various parts of said economies?  Did the capitalist class of both societies 'support' both parties simply to \"shore up\" their power, at large, or did only a fraction of each nation's capitalist support them (the most reactionary and authoritarian)?  If it's the latter, why are such \"rumors\" of \"mass capitalist support\" for fascism still spread so much (esp. within socialist and leftist circles online)?  And, finally... why would capitalists who weren't 'otherwise-very-reactionary' support such a \\*radical shift\\* in government and politics \\*as fascism\\*, just to \"shore up capitalism\" when... in countries like the US, for example, well into the 1800s and early 1900s, \"corporatist\" governments throughout the country were PERFECTLY WILLING AND ABLE to \"help the capitalists keep 'unfettered' capitalism intact\" for a long while (until 30s with Wagner Act)?  Why would Germany and\/or Italy, in those days, feel like they \"need\" fascism, per se, to \"take down\" the communists, unions and the like?  Was the 'threat of full-scale revolution' really so much bigger in those days?  Wouldn't a heavily anti-union, anti-worker \"laissez-faire-esque\" Germany and\/or Italy, politics-wise have \"done the job\" just fine, in terms of repressing worker and anti-corporate revolt?\n\nWas fascism, economically, simply a \"managed capitalism\" that various corporate leaders (and small businessmen, to some extent) in both nations felt was \"necessary for a while\" to \"keep threats at bay\" to their economic power (let alone capitalism as a whole), which they were willing to \"put up with a lot\" so long as workers got few-to-zero rights and such?  But... come to think of it, I recently came across info suggesting that, in fact, to some degree, in at least \\*some\\* German workplaces, there \\*was\\*, if nothing else, enterprise unions which may have \"campaigned fairly hard\" on \\*behalf of\\* workers in certain industries? ...which might seem to 'run contrary' to the notion that those corporate leaders \"accepted fascist control to put up with an interventionist arrangement to keep anti-corporate power and rebellion under control\"?\n\nFurthermore... why did a group of, at best, mostly \\*middle-class or upper-middle-class ultraconservatives\\* form and start the Nazi Party and Fascist Italy, if it was a \"last-ditch effort to shore-up economic power and capitalism\" from the 'corporate ruling class', for a highly-reactionary anticommunist agenda?  If \\*the capitalists themselves\\* truly were, for the most part, \"fascists at heart purely for economic motivations\", why didn't \\*they\\*, themselves, campaign heavily to \"undermine elections in favor of corporate power\", in \"standard elections\" (similar to corporate control in US, Canadian and similar \"bourgeois\" democratic processes of the modern era)?  Could they not have \"formed their own 'populist' party or 2\" in favor of such stuff, esp. with heavy funding of their own? Or maybe, at least, 'lobby hard' the executive and\/or legislative branches of Italy and Germany pre-fascism? rather than rely on some 'random newcomer' like Hitler\n\nMy apologies for the length of this post.

Or how Southern attitudes to enslavement changed from 1776 to 1861? I got interested in the subject a few weeks ago, and, honestly, was expecting to see members of the Confederacy government predominately view themselves as a *continuation* of the Founding. Yet, looking at the primary sources, many of the leading Confederates seem to openly *mock* and\/or *attack* much of the Declaration of Independence or Constitution. (Particularly the notion that \"all are created equal\")\n\nI'm sure many people here are familar with the \"Cornerstone Speech\" by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens in terms of the Lost Cause and the mythology that the Confederacy wasn't fighting over slavery.  It's been extensively quoted in terms of this paragraph:\n\n> Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. \n\nYet I haven't seen many comments on the *rest of the speech*... which also makes a significant amount of claims \u2014 in a \"history of ideas\" way \u2014 that I haven't seen mentioned or analyzed by essentially any political scientists, historians, or commentators, but are in my mind very interesting in terms of current politics and debates surrounding the Founding.\n\nWhile it's often assumed that the Confederates saw themselves as successors to the American Revolution, it appears to me - and I might be wrong here - that many of them *openly* contested both the Declaration of Independence and parts of the Constitution and\/or saw their ideals in *contradiction* to it as well.\n\nFor example, the *New York Times* reports Stephens [stating:](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1861\/03\/25\/archives\/the-starvation-humbug-again.html)\n\n> In the fourth place, and this is the principal and most important point of all -- we have settled, and, I trust, settled forever, the great question which was the prime cause of our separation from the United States -- I mean the question of African Slavery. -- ***The old Constitution set out with a wrong idea on this subject; it was based upon an erroneous principle; it was founded upon the idea that African Slavery is wrong, and it looked forward to the ultimate extinction of that institution. But time has proved the error, and we have corrected it in the new Constitution.*** We have based ours upon principle of the inequality of races, and the principle is spreading -- it is becoming appreciated and better understood; ***and though there are many, even in the South, who are still in the shell upon this subject, yet the day is not far distant when it will be generally understood and appreciated -- not only in the South, but everywhere else. The world is rapidly progressing in its views on this subject, and in a very few years we may witness great changes in respect to this institution.***\n\nSimilarly, in [the Cornerstone Speech](https:\/\/sourcebooks.fordham.edu\/mod\/1861stephens.asp) he states:\n\n> The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions\u2014African slavery as it exists among us\u2014the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the \"rock upon which the old Union would split.\" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.\n\n> ***The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error.*** It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it\u2014when the \"storm came and the wind blew, it fell.\"\n\n> Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. ***This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago.*** Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man.... I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man. The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, ***I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.***\n\nIt's interesting that Stephens is saying here that the \"errors of the past [Founding] generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago [1841]\". Implying that even many Southerners were aware of the contradictions of continued enslavement at the time of the Founding - and that white Southern attitudes towards slavery apparently transformed from a \"necessary evil\" in 1789 to a positive good by the time of 1861. Notably, even Jefferson, who would seemingly be one of the Founders that would be quotable by the Confederate government, is seemingly seen by Stephens as more of an *enemy* than friend. Other leading quotes from officials in the Confederate administration make similar negative quotes on the Founding - including even a half-hearted wish that they remained in the British Empire - describing the \"old Constitution\" and the \"Declaration\" as \"the Founders mistakes\" and \"rejection of the natural order\". Many even mock figures such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, *et al.*.\n\nThis definitely wasn't what I was expecting going into the primary literature.\n\nIs there any good resources on:\n\n* Did Southern attitudes on race and slavery evolve between 1776 and 1861?\n* Did the Confederates view the American Founders and documents positively?  Many seem to criticize the original Founding, and particularly figures such as Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and, strangely enough, Thomas Jefferson. \n\nIs Stephens being hyperbolic here? Or was the \"prevailing view\" at the Founding truly that:\n\n> that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away.","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1678557123.0},{"title":"Sources about the partition of India often use passive language such as \"chaos\" and \"population transfer\" to describe the mass migration and death that occured.

In Rome, a highly educated Greek tutor and a common laborer could both be slaves, but it seems that each slave would be worth something different. Slaves could earn, buy, or be granted their own freedom, but it's not clear to me how this worked. If a slave is property, then property can't \"buy\" itself, right? Would it require the owner's permission? Could a slave effectively be more wealthy than a free citizen? Did slaves have any rights, or perhaps certain \"strata\" of slaves?\n\nThis isn't something that you see in popular depictions of slavery in the American South, which of course due to recency bias is what many of us think of when we think of slavery.\n\nMore importantly, what's the functional distinction between a slave, versus an indentured servant, versus other types of workers who were bound in contracts or to the land in such a way that they would have no real freedom to leave?

But I know that in real-life one of Brazil's biggest historical disadvantages has been the fact that the Cerrado (the Brazilian tropical savanna biome) has been largely useless for large-scale agriculture up to the 1960s.\n\nThere was both a socio-economic lack and a technological lack that, when solved, allowed the Cerrado to become the breadbasket of Brazil that it is today.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n>Until the mid-1960s, **agricultural activities in the Cerrado were very limited, since natural cerrado soils are not fertile enough for crop production**, directed mainly at the extensive production of beef cattle for subsistence of the local market. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to Bras\u00edlia has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region: From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental subsidy programs were launched to promote agriculture, with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region.As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.  \n**The Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, Embrapa, discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year.** The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equaling around five tons of lime per hectare. **This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area.** Researchers also developed tropical varieties of soybeans, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main soyabeans exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.  \nToday the Cerrado region provides more than 70% of the beef cattle production in the country, being also a major production center of grains, mainly soya, beans, maize, and rice.\\[33\\] Large extensions of the Cerrado are also used for the production of cellulose pulp for the paper industry, with the cultivation of several species of eucalyptus and pines, but as a secondary activity. Coffee produced in the Cerrado is now a major export.\n\nThis all was made possible by the gradual transfer of technology from advanced countries such as the US and Europe to the Global South in the 1950s onwards, iirc.\n\nNow, I don't think the development of tropical varieties of temperate crops such as soybeans could happen before genetic manipulation becomes a thing, and it does right from the 1960s onwards. But what about industrial methods to lower the acidity of the soils with lime and phosporus? What about large-scale, mechanized, industrial agriculture? I'm sure those technologies did exist in the Global North before they reached the South. What I don't know is how long did more developed countries have them.\n\nSo, think of a world where, everything else being equal, Brazil is an advanced country like the US and Europe and, thus, had access to such technologies as early as they had. How much earlier can the Cerrado be transformed into the valuable and productive agricultural land it is today?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678489164.0},{"title":"why was the British Navy capable of traversing the Atlantic Ocean while the Japanese Navy filled to do the same across the pacific?","author":"gomi-panda","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11o3194\/why_was_the_british_navy_capable_of_traversing\/","text":"I don't know much about the oceans to be able to compare the two.

Thanks for the links to answers, btw, they were very interesting. \n\nThe answers, though, got me thinking. One of the answers referenced how WW1 was the first time where a war between (mostly) European powers had resulted in large scale fighting outside Europe. Of course there were conflicts outside Europe in the 7 years war and Napoleonic wars, but these were not anywhere near the scale of fighting in Europe. \n\nI do not doubt that the scale of fighting outside Europe in WW1 was immense, but I was wondering how important was it? For example, what impact did the fighting in colonial Africa have on the outcome of the war? Was there ever any chance of those conflicts being decisive in the War? What was the reason for the colonial powers to feel they needed to conduct large scale campaigns away from Europe? It\u2019s an area of the War I think is often overlooked. I certainly know next to nothing about it. Being schooled in the UK, we learn a lot about WW1, but almost exclusively that focuses on the Western Front, with maybe a brief mention of Gallipoli, Lawrence of Arabia, and perhaps a small mention of the Russian Revolution. \n\n(I also want to quickly say, I don\u2019t know if this is a historically accurate view, but in my mind the naval conflicts in the Atlantic, such as the u-boat campaigns, while not actually taking place in Europe, were extensions of the European conflict.

We know that the Myceaneans spoke an Indo-European language and wrote in Linear B, while the Minoans (probably) didn't speak an Indo-European language.\n\nIn the proto-indo-european language, they had words specifically about quasi-Steppe culture of animal husbandry, honey, honeybees, and the like. They were also (allegedly) incredibly patriarchal, without words for women (instead, they were simply wives, which I assume, meant that women were some sort of class of property). The rationale that makes sense to me is that the language grew out of the goods, services, objects, and actions relevant to the community that spoke the language.\n\nI also learned about linguistic 'laws' - i.e. Grimm's Laws - and the movement of sounds and inflections over time. I also remember reading recently that we've catalogued hundreds of thousands of Ancient Greek names (not, I assume, from the Bronze Age) over time.\n\n**So here's my hypothesis**.\n\nThe Minoan language (and its greater family) was probably spoken around the Mediterranean, to some extent, for quite some time at the same time the indo-europeans were spreading out around the area as well. I assume that, because trade was so integral to the Mediterranean world, and there was a heavy economic incentive to speak the same language in order to trade, there were significant pressures to conform to some sort of Minoan-Mediterranean language prior to the introduction of Indo-European. By looking at the ways in which words were pronounced, shifted while in contact with other geographic areas (like, say, if a name went from CH-AOS to K-AOS, perhaps it could mean that the language neighbor emphasized the \"k\" sound over the \"ch\" sound, as an example). Furthermore, maybe we have other historical examples of what happens to language, words, and pronunciation when a language family that includes significant inflection usage (Indo-European) interacts with a language with an (alleged) Verb+Subject+Object structure (Minoan).\n\nFurthermore, when the Mycenaeans encountered the Minoan civilization, they had to, by necessity, borrow a lot of words from the Minoan vocabulary to make sense of these new words and concepts that they had never encountered before - kings (wanax), boats, ships, wine, olives, etc. So what would come to American English as \"Ohio\" was originally the \"Ohi-yo.\" We know the place names kept their non-Greek names. So why couldn't other words for ships, olives, frescos, and the like transfer? Plus, since the Minoans appear to be significantly less patriarchal, perhaps a lot of the female-related words  came directly from the Minoan?\n\nSo couldn't we log all known instances (and any known pronunciations) across the Mediterranean in some sort of computer system, code it for time and geographic area, test the pronunciation changes with our known linguistic laws, note the changes, and then, by a kind of reverse-engineering, come up with a semblance of a **Minoan language**?\n\nSorry if this was a bit daft or long-winded.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678404447.0},{"title":"Are there any historical inaccuracies in the Quran?","author":"PhysicalArmadillo375","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ncvth\/are_there_any_historical_inaccuracies_in_the_quran\/","text":"While historical inaccuracies in the bible have been well documented, are there any notable historical inaccuracies in the Quran?","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1678417694.0},{"title":"When did Americans become generally aware of kangaroos?","author":"BInYourBonnet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11mw1re\/when_did_americans_become_generally_aware_of\/","text":"I'm researching a popular anti-abortion pamphlet written in Boston in 1865\/66 called \"Why Not?

The question was triggered by coming across a quote on this sub attributed to Muscogee leader Speckled Snake in the context of the debate on Indian Removal in 1829 (only partial reproduction): \n\n>\"Brothers! I have listened to a great many talks from our great father. But they always begin and ended in this- \"Get a little further, you are too near me.\" Brothers! Our great father says that \"where we are now, our white brothers have always claimed the land.\" He speaks with a straight tongue, and cannot lie. But when he first came over the wide waters, while he was yet small, and stood before the great chief at the council on Yamacraw Bluff, he said \"Give me a little land, which you can spare, and I shall pay you for it.\" Brothers! When our great father made us a talk, on a former occasion, and said, \"Get a little further, go beyond the Oconee, the Ocmulgee; there is a pleasant country,\" he also said \"It shall be yours forever.\"\n\nThe terminology here (assuming the quote represents an actual reproduction) seems based on notions of kinship and seems to suggest that the Muscogee understood the Americans to belong to a shared community of common descent, but at the same time I am very much aware this speech was made with a particular rhetorical intent by a leader of a group which had been in contact with the American government and military for decades by that point. Nonetheless, it made me wonder how Native American communities conceived of Americans as a community with a particular political organisation. Given the massive differences in scale in terms of population and resources by the 19th century between the United States as a state versus even the largest Native communities, it seems hard to imagine that such communities would see the former as simply an extremely large kinship network. \n\nThis is not even considering the large variety of social and political traditions between groups sharing little but the label 'Native' assigned to them by white settlers, which must have led to drastically different conceptions of social and political structures.

We do distinguish between the Roman Regnum, the Roman Republic, the \"Roman Empire\", and then Byzantium. \n\nThe \"Germany\" of today could be said to have only existed in 1991 with reunification, or maybe it changed under Nazi Germany, or the Weimar Republic... etc. But modern Germany came about in 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty, and before that it was a German Confederation that sat beside Prussia. \n\nEngland became a republic in 1649 before reformed back into it's kingdom in 1660, but we don't regard England as ceasing to exist for that period. We DO seem to distinguish between England and what could be considered an English hegemony in the form of Great Britain, and then the United Kingdom. \n\nSo you can see the clear distinctions... sort of.

I take most issue with this perception because China itself was conquered by the Mongols but somehow the Yuan dynasty is considered a part of the cycle. \n\nSo here's my issues:\n\n* It's clearly not based on type of government or how long a particular government rules.\n* It's clearly not based on a particular geography as the center of regional power seems to constantly shift, wax, and wane.\n* There does seem to come a point where identities change, though.

In the article, an archeologist mentioned that inside the city walls were the important buildings like temples, but nearly all the people actually lived outside the walls. I thought that explained how so many huge cities like Babylon have such a small area enclosed by their walls. I also always assumed that large cities must of had miles of farms and pastures to support their populations since, according to Google, even with modern farming techniques you need about 5 acres of land to support one person. So a city like Hattusa with 30,000 people must of had at least a couple hundred square miles of land dedicated to agriculture, and they still would have had to import a lot. And that's to say nothing of Babylon's 100,000+ population. But if that's true, I don't really understand how the walls functioned if most people, and presumably most of their possessions, were not only outside the walls, but not even within visual distance of them. Unless the walls were just to protect the priests, aristocracy, etc.  \n\n\nDid most people live outside the city walls, with at least some people up to several miles outside the city walls (making it impossible to outrun any attacking chariots, etc.), or am I missing something about how these cities kept themselves fed?\n\nIn case of attack, did everyone at least try to hole up behind the walls while their homes outside were ransacked (which seems to defeat the point of having walls), or were the the people in the suburbs left to their own devices?","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678238407.0},{"title":"What are the standard sources for the sequence of inventions on each continent, pre-contact?","author":"Burbly2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11lga9e\/what_are_the_standard_sources_for_the_sequence_of\/","text":"A recent [blog post by Noah Smith](https:\/\/noahpinion.substack.com\/p\/interview-kevin-kelly-editor-author) had the following intriguing claim:\n\n> in pre-history, when there was scarce communication between the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, we had a N=5 case.
