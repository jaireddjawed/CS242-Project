        "text": "Hello! I don't really know if my question belongs here but I'll give it a try..\n\nFor the past few years I have been extremely obsessed with the way I look.\n I went from the girl that couldn't care less about her appearance to the girl that will cake her face with makeup every morning and look at her reflection every hour.\n\nFor some reasons, and I know that will sound weird, but I also have no real idea of what I look like. Sometimes I feel nice and confident and sometimes I feel like crying out of frustration.\n\nMy mood of the day really depends of the way I look and it's draining me..\n\nThis'll sound silly but sometimes I feel so frustrated and stressed about the way I look that I scratch myself really hard. This bad habit unfortunately left me with scars on my hands.\n\nNobody has never judged my appearance, I even get compliments from my friends,so I have no idea where this came from. Deep inside of me I know that I am not as ugly as I think I am and I know that appearance doesn't matter as  much as I think it does but it's stronger than me, I just cannot stop obssesing over it and it's really tiring.\n\n\nHow can i overcome this? What should I do?\n\nThank you for reading\n\n (I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes; English is not my first language)",

I felt hurt and frustrated, and the temptation to argue and fight back was overwhelming. But I knew that wasn't the answer.\n\nSo I made a difficult decision to let go and forgive, both myself and the other person. It wasn't easy, but I realized that I couldn't keep bleeding every day and trying to change things outside of my control. I took a deep breath and reminded myself of my own worth.\n\nI learned to accept that we're all imperfect and that sometimes things just don't work out as we want them to. But through acceptance, sympathy, and realization, I found a sense of peace. I stopped trying so hard and just let things be.\n\nAnd then something miraculous happened - everything started to fall into place. It's as if the energies in the universe aligned, and good things started to come my way. I realized that being a good human with good intentions can go a long way, and that sometimes, just letting go and trusting the universe can lead to wonderful things. You just gotta be a good human with pure intentions and should be willing to go beyond your normal thinking patterns and do beyond things.\n\n(I tried my best to write as effective as possible, if you read all of it, i appreciate it so much, thankyou.

Solid job in a great city after 7 years of mediocre jobs despite going to a \"good\" college, gf for 5 years who has been through a lot of positive changes (2 upward job changes and moving out of my parents' place finally), and my family is actually pretty chill considering I am a first gen Indian-American and have let me have freedom more than most of my other friends with conservative Indian parents.\n\nSometimes I just feel that mentally my approach is all wrong. I always feel inferior to people and I have so many embarassing things in my past that I can't let go of that I feel define me. I feel like I have never been myself. I always feel like I have to try twice as hard to get half as far socially. People sometimes notice this and say be myself, but when I don't try hard people ask me if I'm okay. Everyone seems so much more likeable and fun, and no matter where I go everyone kinda talks to me like I'm too naive. People have always said I'm \"too good\" and \"so well intentioned\" and have a \"heart of gold\". Including my own parents, and they say it like it's negative. I hate it so much. And most of these people have gotten wayyyy ahead of me. It feels like not only am I socially stunted, but it's the reason that I haven't gotten as far in life.\n\nHow do I be more nefarious? How can people take me more seriously? It's like I feel that if I tried to be assertive people are just gonna double down and say \"being assertive is not for someone like you\". Last time someone said this to me I got so angry and just wanted to punch them in the face till they couldn't breathe. A person who is no longer my friend anymore told me once \"bro you're like a golden retriever, so pure and so easily manipulated I can probably convince you that the sky is green\". This kid constantly called me \"whipped\", \"a loser\", and \"cuck\", and almost sent him a death threat because I had no idea how else to react. Like in situations like this, how do you stand up for yourself without violence and not look defensive?\n\nI still think about that and every single negative thing that people have said about me, to the point where I remember specific dates that it happened. How do I develop confidence if I've never had it before? I don't know what the feeling of confidence even is, and I want to just be normal. I feel like it's so hard to change things knowing that everyone else is so much better off socially than me, and that I just had to be born stupid. What are some truths of life that I missed out on that are holding me back, or do I have to admit that it's another issue like a learning disability?",

I somehow think this persona will take over and I wont get the serious side of me back. I also feel carefree people are not serious people, they don't treat the world seriously etc. This is my own bias I know because I know some very successful and intelligent people who are still carefree in social environments.

These are software programs that are built to hold all of your knowledge,experience,and thoughts. \n\nI have been using one since going back to college for a double associates in a tech field.  And let me tell you.  It changes the way you think. \n\n1.) Helps you create connections to other pieces of information.  \n\n2.) Helps you learn how to properly learn something\n\n3.) Makes you think in big picture instead of cramming through chapters\n\n4.) Infinitely scaleable.  You can use them to hold everything from notes. Exams, journal entries, projects, etc.\n\n5.) Helps you learn a primitive language.  The two that I've used have used a HTML Markdown backend to make sure that the pages are small data wise. \n\n\nI would suggest that everyone read either Digital Zettlekasten or How to take smart notes to familiarize yourself with the process of how you would use these types of programs.  Then either use Obsidian MD or Notion as your software. (These are the two that I've used. I'm sure there are others). \n\nAs an added bonus you can visually see what you know rather than not knowing what you fo know (which means you know nothing)",

I know how bad it is for me, but with no prospects, friends, love life, nothing I'm good at, nothing I enjoy, e.t.c., it all feels so bleak and hopeless.

And how you can deal with it.\n\n0) Be brave, courageous, the lion's silence is more scary than it's roar.\n \n1) Stop Caring about them. Let them think whatever they want to. Don't try to influence their thinking. \n\n2) Be yourself and be righteous at all times.. let the bandwagon go away.\n\n3) Be capable of surviving alone. Remember, you come alone and go alone. You are not here to please everyone. \n\n4) Read Books, for entertainment and growth. It's a healthy addition. One chapter a day. \n\n5) Keep a journal or diary. Practice articulating your thoughts together, and write only what's true and for what it is , not based on overstatement or assumptions. This will help you process your emotions. Then you will write positive affirmations. \nYou will accept yourself, no matter how you're and what you have done. It's you. You love yourself, say I love you to yourself. You are nobody else but you. \n\n6) The world is a murky place. Save yourself. Nobody knows what's hiding and deceptive? Do you ? Be vigilant and sober. Do what's need to be done, do what you should do and don't do what you shouldn't. This is how you will have control over your life.\n\n7) When you think  people laugh at you , whispering, looking at you , discussion is about you... think yourself as a formidable force instead of a weakling. You are valuable. Have a smile ,  a confident demeanor radiates energy. It's okay to be stupid , look stupid at times but never to be giving up. If you don't face your fears you'd never learn. \n\n8) Research and increase your practical knowledge.\nIt would help you in situations. Ready wit is always reliable. \n\n9) Excercises like running is easiest. Specifically, run without listening music and you'd be feeling free, gasping fresh air , strong, healthier. If you're lazy enough to do complex ones !!\n\n10) Detox yourself. Build yourself.. come let's shed your weakness and change yourself in positive way. There's zero place for negativity.",

When you are with friends, you are not really focused on meeting new people, you're just talking with the same old one and you might miss opportunities to meet someone new.\n\nWhen i went out recently to a bar, i approached this girl and we had great conversations because she was alone. Another example is when i was standing alone, 1 girl approached me and we talked etc. I met 5+ people because i was there by myself just vibing. Now if i went with a friend im highly sure none of that would have happened because i would be glued to the friend, talking to them in our own click, and not venturing out. When you are with friends you're not easy to approach.  I would have talked to this other girl but she was with her friends and i dont like randomly jumping in, plus she was enjoying herself with friends which is great for her.\n\nWhen you are standing or sitting alone, you are way more open to things around you. People see you alone and notice it and can easily connect. You also might do things vastly different like going to a new area, sitting somewhere different, and so on.

The idea of dieting and giving up my dopamine filled junk seems too boring. I think I would hate my life if I ate clean. But if I'm eating a clean diet the idea of eating junk food all day makes me nauseous. I can't even imagine going back to junk food because it makes me depressed and I have things I want to achieve. \n\n\nThis isn't even a food issue. When I'm falling into a funk I can't picture myself changing because I feel like I would hate myself. But when I'm doing things that make me happy without immediate gratification like improving myself I couldn't imagine giving that up to do nothing. Don't get me wrong, I'm much better now managing my pendulum making sure I don't swing too hard one way or another. Is there anyone that feels this way or even knows what I'm talking about?",

I'm just looking for thoughts and maybe some anecdotal advice on how you or others deal with something like this.   \n\n\nI (19M) was broken up with about two weeks ago, and we were together for about a year. We were both the same age and it was long distance for the last half of the relationship (going to first year of university and all).   \n\n\nOnce we were separated by distance, it got a lot more difficult. She knows I was struggling with some mental health, but not to the full extent. It wasn't until we were long distance for a while that I started to kind of have these breakdowns where I'd just shut her out, not really communicate, we'd call and I'd just not talk or give yes or no answers. This is bad, and I knew it was bad. And I'd profusely apologize after I came to my senses. Sometimes, it was just that I was stressed and I didn't know how to communicate with that. I thought it was stupid and it was something I had to deal with all on my own. Sometimes I'd just have dark intrusive thoughts and battles with mental health, and I didn't know how to handle them. I never wanted to hurt her, that was never my intention at all. I was struggling with my own issues, and I didn't want to push them onto her, but I didn't know how to communicate with this, so I just didn't communicate at all which is even worse.   \n\n\nEventually, she had enough. And I told her that I wasn't good for her, that she needed to decide if she still wanted to be with me. She said that she wanted the relationship to end, so it did. I didn't want this, but I knew that it was the best decision for her and for me. I wasn't going to change unless I forced myself to change.   \n\n\nBut I know that everything I did to her was the reason why it ended; I caused her so much pain and hurt even though I loved her more than anything. I'd thought we'd be together forever, and now suddenly, that dream is gone.  I'm still struggling to not miss her and to come to terms that I'm never going to be with her again. But mostly, I think I need to be able to forgive myself so I can continue to become a better person instead of using this breakup as a crutch to not do anything.   \n\n\nI know I need to be able to forgive myself, but I don't know how to get over everything I've done.   \n\n\nI hope that I'm not breaking the rules with a breakup post, but the main point of this post is for me to learn how I can forgive myself, so I can continue to work on self-improvement.",

        "text": "Whether it's about friendships or relationships, why it's the case that most of the people would just normally like to see them casually &amp; don't value one's dedication or genuineness much? You would get too much worried for others, be there when they need help or are down, but they wouldn't even notice if you're in trouble. And, someday you would hear that you're not their bf/gf that you need to share or ask too much. You would know that most of the time you were just a burden for them &amp; they were just calling u when they need someone to time pass with.\n\nSo, should one just become indifferent &amp; minimise their interactions so much that these things don't happen? Because even if you know that all the times, you were just being what you are &amp; have always valued your connections, still some people won't care. \nJust being casual, not caring much, not giving a shit, not being too much idealistic.... if that's how it is, then my personality needs a serious overhaul.",

        "text": "What the title says.\nAs a child I was spoiled and now it is affecting me:\n\n-I have problems with social anxiety and socialising in general. \n\n-I can't remember the last time I risked being rejected (personal relationships, work stuff etc...)\n\n-I always need someone to tell me what to do or what to decide, sometimes even what to think.\n\n-I never initiate anything, but always wait for others to initiate things. Also recently I  realized that I when meeting new people, I always wait for them to talk to me, which causes them to think that I don't like them. I also never do anything or go out anywhere alone. \n\n-From 2016 to 2018(22 to 25 yrs old) I used to live with my brother, at the beginning he used to cook and do household stuff and I would wait for him to tell me what to do around the house. I only learned to cook after he moved out, I can also clean and tidy up myself now but I'm still learning this stuff.\n\n-Also I have trouble doing things when they get difficult, I would just give up instead.\n\n-if things went wrong, my first instinct is to blame others around me.\n\nHow would I go about fixing these issues? Would therapy help or would I be wasting the therapists time if I went to them because of these issues? I am currently trying to find a therapist but the nearest appointment is in 6 months.",

I am a software engineer by  profession and I like doing what I do. Its not a task for me like some  of my other colleagues, so if I sit for a tutorial or make a project, I  will love doing it.\n\nIts just that I  love other distractions too. I have a 10-7 job on weekdays and apart  from that job I want to study/ make projects for levelling up my skills.\n\nI  have a course that I am supposed to be doing, I also have a set of  topics that I need to study (probably daily one by one) in order to  prepare for my job interview. But most of the time I end up playing  Valorant or surfing instagram or wasting my time somewhere else. I also  have a girlfriend and I  need to make some time to talk to her too.  Right now, its like we talk every half hour or maybe not once for hours  but then multiple times in one hour, etc. I think this also distracts me  from studying as sometimes I am solving a question and she might  message at that very time only.\n\nTo  track my progress, I have made a excel wherein I put the questions that  I solved along with the date in green color and for days that I didn't  study, I put black rows. This has helped me get better than what I was  doing previously, but it is still not enough.\n\nSo,  how should I manage all these things? Talk to my gf, play game maybe  (not daily ofc) and study two different things regularly (project for  levelling up and study for job interview (daily))? How to manage my time  properly and not waste it?",

        "text": "\nIt feels like every single morning I wake up, I'd be flooded with haunting thoughts and suicidal ideation. My heart would race, my palms would get sweaty and I would freeze up and unable to do things. It has been a serious problem I'm facing everyday. \n\nI talked to my therapist about it. She gave me some practical ways of dealing with it. \n\nEvery time I think of something bleak and depressing, I would say to myself, my thoughts are not me. I think them. I experience them. But they are NOT me. \n\nI distance myself from my thoughts. I envision myself looking at a version of myself with those feelings and step away and just observing. Not avoiding it. Just not entertaining it. My therapist has taught me this technique and I must say, it works. \n\nAvoiding or trying not to think about it is not the goal here. The goal here is to not be consumed by our thoughts and emotions. Think of it as a child throwing a tantrum and the best thing for you to do is to not entertain it and be calm. Remaining neutral with our thoughts and emotions. There are only comfortable and uncomfortable emotions. They're not good or bad. \n\nIt is something I have to constantly remind myself of everyday. \n\nYour LIFE isn't you.

        "text": "2 years ago, I was at the worst state of my life.\n\nI did absolutely nothing but play video games, I spent all the time I had everyday numbing my brain and avoiding life.\n\nIt's all my fault, I was put in a difficult situation, Alone in CORONAVIRUS lOCKDOWN.\n\nI was weak, afraid and insecure.\n\nI decided to take a fresh start, I went from masturbating everyday and not taking care of my self to become an absolute Speciman in just  2 years.\n\nHow did I do that?\n\nFirst, I repented for my sins, I know a good amount of you don't particulary believe in God, But I do and it helped me forgive myself for all the henious things I did.\n\nYou see every time you did a bad act, even if you avoid thinking about it, it remains in your conscious and the more bad acts you do, the worse it gets.\n\nThere are 2 types of people: People who have an ego centered conscious and people who have a central conscious.\n\npeople who have an ego centered conscious would never admit their mistakes, because for them life revolves purely around them and only around them.\n\nIf they were to hurt a person, their conscious wouldn't make them feel bad, but instead it will help them justify their act, and that my friends is a dangerous thing, and it's why some people never ever repent for their mistakes, and they would do absolutely anything to get what they want at any cost\n\nCentral conscious people are the opposite, if they do an act to harm someone, their conscious will always remind them of it, and what does that do to them?\n\nThey are constantly haunted by it, and I am that type, all the bad things I did from self-harm and not taking care of my self, and other shit from the past came to haunt me as I sat alone in my room locked because everyone was stuck at home.\n\nI couldn't face my conscious at that point, So I decided to numb it with mindless activities like video games, tv shows , anything that wouldn't make me think about my depressing reality, that also meant that I didn't care for myself at all, I remember going about 30-40 days without showering, it was absolutely horrible and to say the least traumatic.\n\nBut, when you repent for the wrong you did, things take a different turn, you are only able to forgive yourself once you admit the mistake you did, and some people do it with self-conversation but the best way to do it, is with god, I repented and I accepted my failure and decided to move forward and not let my past-self haunt me.\n\nPain is the only way to grow as a human, like the saying goes what doesn't kill me. makes me stronger.\n\nThis is especially the case for men, but for women too.\n\nThis world needs strong individuals, the moment you become an adult, the weight on your shoulders increases, and that's why teens begin their adult years with rebellious acts, because they can't handle the weight laid on their shoulders and they aren't used to pain.\n\nThere is a moment in every man's life when he finally understands that he is not a kid anymore, and that he has responsibilities that he should meet.\n\nThe gym is the perfect exercise for this, because when you go the gym you deal with weights, you lift those weights and you feel the pain, and the first time you go there, you feel demotivated feeling that it is impossible for you to become like the fellow gym members who have built a strong routine of their lives around the gym, you think it's not fair, but once you tackle that and force yourself to be patient and endure the first hard weeks, you start to enjoy going to the gym, and slowly the weight that was once on your shoulders becomes easier to meet, you learn self-discipline when you tackle the hardest weights.\n\nEndurance is built when you embrace pain, and push through it and that is a very powerful trait.\n\nPeople go the gym to build muscle or improve their physique, I go to the gym to beat myself up.\n\nI go to the gym to feel the pain and endure it because in that way nothing can phase me.\n\nBack to the 2 types of consciousness, remember the Ego-centered conscious it is built, you aren't born with it,certain situations in life build it.\n\nIf you had hard parents growing up, you will have the ego-centered conscious because it is the only way you manage to survive, if you had loving parents growing up you have the central conscious because you observe the love you were given and can't be selfish.\n\nWhen you endure Pain, Your central consciousness bends it can't haunt you anymore because it sees you struggling to survive with all that pain and gives you power.\n\nWhen you do the right things in life, your self-love automatically increases and the main problem with people dealing with depression is they don't know where to start, their central-consciousness has numbed them like it numbed me.\n\nI fought my central consciousness with hardwork and pain, I wake up every morning and instantly no matter how I am feeling , I sit in a ice cold bath for 5 minutes that kills the consciousness, because the consciousness is the voice inside your head, and the voice is telling me get out, and I say no, It's that easy, you become fearless, your anxiety goes away, and you become ready for war.\n\nYou are no longer worried about anything, and from there you do only what you want to do.\n\nThe voices inside you can be silenced and the key is pain.\n\nThe human population has become too comfortable and that is the main reason why all the mental illnesses are going through the roof these days, 100 years ago our life could only be lived by royalty, the one difference between the royalty and us, is the royalty knew who they are and had to run the country.\n\nThese days, most people are born with a royal-life, but no royal duties, and it leaves them stuck in a situation where they don't know what to do.\n\nThose who suffer from the mental-illnesses are the most special individuals out there, but their problem is the lack of discomfort, the lack of pain.\n\nIf they seek a pain, they will embrace their true potential, they mute the inner bitch inside of themselves that stops them from seeking their maximum potency and then and only then they embrace their true potential.\n\nThis world is a jungle, and the only thing that differentiates a Lion from an Elephant is the mindset, The lion has no Inner bitch, when the lion sees his prey he acts, he doesn't think.\n\nwhile the Elephant is big as he is sees a rat and he starts running because of his inner bitch.\n\nStay Strong, Embrace the pain we were born to face and you will be invincible",

Life is okay, but I am constantly realizing just how useless I am now that I am finally truly out in my own. \n\nI lived abroad for 10 years after graduating from college, never really needing to worry about home maintenance, car payments, basically anything required to be a functioning adult in the real world.\n\nCame back to the states, lived with my folks for a further five years while I restarted my career and couldn't move out during the pandemic. I don't really have much to complain about, but still, I can crush myself like nobody's business because of how I feel like I let people walk over me. Family, wife, job, kids, anyone I'm buying stuff from. \n\nThese things just pile up, like\n\nAfter buying my first house, I was essentially banished while my folks and wife flipped it because of how little I know about actual housework. I went over to prove them wrong, only to fail miserably at putting a simple IKEA shelf together. Depressed me for two days and was told maybe I should just watch the kids instead.\n\nAnother recent event, I bought my first car, determined to not pay any extra, left with a $5000 extended warranty I didn't want because I just couldn't say no to the guy and couldn't do math in my heart invert pressure. (I'm going to try to be firm on the phone to cancel that because I'm still in the 60 day window but I have doubts on my ability to do that) \n\nI have a nice job, but my senior management all bailed, and the dopes they were replaced with are useless. People have turned to me for help, but I slowly feel like I've been letting them down. They say I'm good at solving troubleshooting and solving problems, but I've seen what other coworkers are capable of and it makes me feel like they should be in charge. \n\nI know these are small things but with the speed life has suddenly taken off more over the last few months (job, house, car) , and I feel totally insecure about the whole affair, like I'm constantly being taken advantage of left and right like I have no idea what I'm doing. \n\nI feel like I missed out on so many things I should have learned while I was off living elsewhere without a care in the world (aside from my mental collapse at 26). I feel like I leaned on my parents way too much to get me through life and can't do anything on my own, and now I have my wife to make big decisions I lack the confidence to make.\n\nI've brought this up, and I'm always told I can support my family and be patient with my kids, and I should just accept that I suck at other things.

        "text": "If you take the time to read this, just know I really appreciate you. I‚Äôm a 24M who is just trying to improve his life regarding my questionable intelligence \n\nTo give you some context of the current situation I‚Äôm in, both my parents are unemployed and I currently support them. I have a job that pays me enough to do so I‚Äôm blessed for that opportunity. However, I have hit my first major bump. \n\nWith this new job I have in tech, I just lack critical thinking or just feel like my brain is slow and just feel like I have a very low IQ. I graduated top of my class at a flagship university but this does not define me well if you keep reading the rest of this thread. \n\n I had to take a certification exam and I failed twice and now it raises some suspicion towards management about my intelligence at a company that I‚Äôve worked for for 5 years.\n\nOn top of the slow thinking, I feel like I can‚Äôt think straight if that makes sense. It takes longer for me to get easy things and I tend to navigate around and freak out and blank out. \n\nBecause of this I found myself cheating a lot in college, and I hated myself for it. I would put so much effort into studying like legit days on end and I would still blank out and forget everything. However, when Covid rolled around and everything went online, I found it easy to depend on others to help me cheat or with homework that I felt my anxiety go away and always felt ‚Äúsecure‚Äù that I had at least someone else to depend on. \n\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just a college thing however, but it‚Äôs been an issue I‚Äôve had my whole life. I‚Äôve always had a lot of anxiety growing up especially around testing and standardized testing scoring fairly low on them. \n\nGrowing and even now, I‚Äôm obese, so I‚Äôm thinking that might have contributed to my anxiety, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure\n\nAnyway to get back on track, I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything by myself especially getting work done that I‚Äôm confident in or not checking in with someone else. Essentially I‚Äôve become completely dependent on others because I can‚Äôt trust myself.\n\nEspecially during calls with my a manger or coworkers I need constant reassurance and I hate that about myself because it makes me look incompetent, but I feel that I have constant brain fog. \n\nI know this will get worse in the future, so please help me get on track to be able to be confident in doing things myself and getting the results I need. Also if anyone has similar experiences or know what this condition is called please let me know because I feel like everything is starting to catch up to me, and I‚Äôm not ready. I can‚Äôt lose my job or live life like this.",

        "text": "Hello, everyone. I‚Äôm writing this for some guidance. Or advice, or whatever really.\n\nThe past year has been one of the most toxic for me. I‚Äôve been selfish, careless and I have made horrible decisions.\n\nStraight up, I cheated on my girlfriend by sexting one girl and entertaining inappropriate convos with another woman at work. Looking back at it, I feel like I was careless and selfish because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting the love and effort in my relationship that I was putting in and when I tried to communicate with her, she seemed to not want to work on herself for us. Seemed like a ‚Äútake me as I am‚Äù behavior and instead of ending the relationship there, I stayed in it and ended up sexting this other girl because it felt like our relationship had become a free-for-all. I carelessly job hopped because I felt that my efforts in the beginning were not being recognized at work. Family back home were going through tough times and one of my parents became very ill. nothing seemed to ever work out for me, so I submitted to my ‚Äòdark‚Äô side. (Kind of cringe but don‚Äôt know what else to call it) and just decided to do whatever the hell I felt like at the moment.\n\nAfter my breakup I had a rebound hookup with an old coworker of mine and a previous flame. That was very dramatic and not helpful at all. I traveled back home and continued to drink and smoke and hit people up left and right for sex. She said she felt like I used her for sex after I admitted I couldn‚Äôt commit to something more, even though I made it very clear from the beginning.\n\nI met up with an old high school friend, we were boys, best friends, he had his girl and his family and things were alright I guess. We got together and drank one night and reminisced on old times and then I got to talking about women I thought were attractive that I felt like hooking up with. As far as I know he‚Äôs always been super faithful to his woman, but apparently he‚Äôs cheated on her, i can‚Äôt help but feel like I encouraged that behavior indirectly. He hasn‚Äôt answered my phone calls or texts and I really feel like he‚Äôs trying to distance himself from me. Which I understand.\n\nI have another close friend of mine who‚Äôs been there for me through these rough times but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve been a negative influence on him as well. I honestly feel like telling all of these people to leave me alone so I can just pick up the pieces on my own. I don‚Äôt want to ruin anyone else‚Äôs life.\n\nI ruined a beautiful relationship and multiple friendships with my carelessness and immaturity.\n\nI recently stopped drinking and smoking and am working on changing other unhealthy habits of mine. I was going to therapy but had to stop when i moved back home. Im trying to go back now that college starts during the summer.\n\nI would love to just move away far and just focus on the person I would like to become and let these people be, but money is an issue and I am unemployed. I really feel like I have ruined my life and those of everyone else around me.\n\nI‚Äôve always tried to do right by people and when I felt it was getting me nowhere I started being a selfish prick. Im wondering if that‚Äôs who I am deep down and I am afraid of the answer.\n\nHas anyone ever been in a situation like this? How did you climb out of this self dug hole? How can I forgive myself without forgetting? How can I achieve and become a good person without letting my past hold me back? I have so many questions.\n\nI left a voicemail telling my friend that I understand if he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me and that I apologize for any influence I may of had on him. I was going to call and apologize to the coworker I had a rebound with and tell her I think it would be better if we never spoke again instead of pretending to be what we were before hooking up.\n\nI honestly just feel disgusted with myself",

        "text": "I'm 22 and I feel like I'm heading down a spiral. I know I \"have my whole life ahead of me\" and everything but I just don't know if that life is gonna turn out okay. I still live with my parents and I just don't want to disappoint them. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life, for a career. I spent the entirety of high school pretty much having fun and not caring about the future. Don't get me wrong, I got excellent grades, I loved my teachers and loved learning all kinds of subjects but I never really chose my \"niche.\" I decided to take a gap year to figure it out but I ended up not doing anything meaningful during that time. I decided to go to community college and ended up getting accepted to my dream college that I didn't even bother applying to in high school because I didn't think I'd get in. \n\nOne quarter in and I pretty much took a currently permanent hiatus. I didn't officially drop out, and I can always come back as readmission is easy for students that already go there. But, I don't like my major. I didn't want to keep on doing it because I wasn't as passionate as I feel you need to be in that field and I'm already in a lot of student debt with no clear indication of where my future is headed. If the whole Biden debt relief thing doesn't come through, I'm not sure if I even want to head back. I've been on this \"hiatus\" for almost two years now (pretty much since the pandemic started) and I feel so stagnated.\n\nThere's so many things that I could see myself doing, but I am overwhelmed with potential choices and paths and whether or not it's something that I truly have a passion for, rather than a fleeting interest (like my major). A part of me feels like everything will come together once I can just find out what I want to do so I can make a roadmap and accomplish my goals one at a time, but the first step is so damn hard.  I've lost count of how many self-help articles and videos I've consumed, how many times I've convinced myself that tommorow will be the day that change starts, and at the end my motivation quickly fades and everything I've \"learned\" goes in one ear, out the other. I have good friends, good family, and a good support group, and I feel like I'm entitled for having so much trouble despite being in a better starting spot than a lot of people who have went on to do greater things without whining about it. I just don't know how to start.",

I‚Äôm so tired of being stupid though. I barely know vocabulary because i never read, i don‚Äôt know anything about politics or the world. Theories and philosophy. I‚Äôve always wanted to be super smart but i‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm useless. Completely dumb and beyond unlikeable. I don‚Äôt even talk to the people i used to play dumb for, we have grown apart since after highschool (i‚Äôm british so highschool was at 16). But it annoys me so much that i am just not smart or actually a worthy person. \n\nHow can i be more smart? I don‚Äôt know what to do. what books to read. i know nothing. i don‚Äôt even go to college. i dropped out because of my mental health last year and just never went back because everything got worse and i was just afraid. I am beyond stupid. I tried to read frankenstein and had absolutely no idea what was being said. I‚Äôm so thick it is unreal. I feel like i manifested becoming actually fucking stupid when i would play as a dumb funny friend. \nI have no motivation.

He left about a month ago and it was hard to say goodbye and even he was crying. He has been texting me less which I know is normal since we‚Äôre not in each others day to day lives anymore. I‚Äôm just an anxiously attached individual so I‚Äôm trying to not worry about it. Thing is I really miss him. I‚Äôm honestly really sad because I think if he asked I would move to him in a heartbeat, I can see myself marrying him in the future and out of all the relationships I‚Äôve ever had I never felt like this. It‚Äôs not exactly a situation where I can just confess my feelings because we both have a lot of past traumas and baggage that we have to work through before being ready for a relationship and I also have to finish my education. I know that there‚Äôs a possibility of us in the future and I‚Äôm going to visit him in a few months but I know I have to move on. I go to the gym 6 days a week, I work and have tons of friends, I‚Äôm in school and I enjoy my current courses, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him most of the day. I just want to be completely independent and happy as a single woman in her twenties, I see so many of my friends have the best time going partying every weekend but I‚Äôm far grown out of the party phase and I eat a great diet due to the gym so that stuff is definitely just not for me. I just don‚Äôt know what else I can do to help myself move on, I‚Äôm not interested in dating apps or hookups and I‚Äôm not trying to distract myself with a new guy. I genuinely just want to be content on my own, I‚Äôm a believer that you have to love yourself before somebody else and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever given myself the proper self love nor do I know how.
