        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5r9fxh/cleopatra_1963_movie_review_part_1_skipping/",
        "text": "Today I am going to finally make a badhistory review I have been wanting to make since a little while ago but I did not get around to it for various reasons and it is of my favourite screen adaptation of Cleopatra (which, come to think of it, is not saying much, I hate bad history in general and most Cleopatra adaptations have more than this). Hopefully this will mildly amuse some of you (if it does I might expand to do a series on the many faces of Cleopatra-bad-history from Shakespeare to HBO or one on old movies like Spartacus or the Ten Commandments) but this is not counting the fact that I have 9 courses that are open right now and a bunch of side projects that I have to complete which is just mad, so my free time is harder to come by.\n\nSeeing as the extended cut of this movie is 4 and a half hours long I am only doing the first half so as to better contain the badness and get really pedantic and in-depth with this. This is also my first /r/badhistory post so bear with my rookie behaviour :-p\n\n14:27 The costumes in this film are far from accurate in several areas. For one thing take a look at [Ptolemy XIII's outfit and headgear](http://imgur.com/fJ4aQHT), it looks like stylized, oddball versions of New Kingdom regalia that a group of children designed for their school play. Nothing at all of the linen robes and diadems/linen headbands that were worn by members of the Ptolemaic Dynasty ( [see an example here of Ptolemy II and his sister wife Arsinoe II on tetradrachm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus#/media/File:Oktadrachmon_Ptolemaios_II_Arsinoe_II.jpg), [Ptolemy V on the tetradrachm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes#/media/File:Tetradrachme_Ptol%C3%A9m%C3%A9e_V.jpg), and finally on [Ptolemy VI on the tetradrachm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_VI_Philometor#/media/File:Ptolemy_VI_Philometor_ring.jpg) ). Now it is true that they are sometimes depicted as wearing traditional Pharaonic regalia (see [Ptolemy I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter#/media/File:British_Museum_Egypt_031.jpg), and [Ptolemy XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XII_Auletes#/media/File:PtolSmash_212.jpg) and [Cleopatra VII and Caesarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion#/media/File:Denderah3_Cleopatra_Cesarion.jpg)) but these are generally speaking stylized representations meant to convey the impression of Pharaonic power with all that entailed, with the primary exception being religious occasions and Cleopatra VII in particular as she identified with Egyptian goddess Isis and wore her crown and sheath dress. In addition to that, the (presumably) Nubian guards behind Ptolemy are out of place, seeing as how the Ptolemies personal guard consisted of *Macedonians*, and the amount of social rungs between Macedonians, Greeks, foreign mercenaries, Egyptians and Nubians makes it seem exceedingly unlikely that Ptolemy XIII would have found himself with an entirely Nubian guard. And then I want to point out how [ridiculous their outfits are](http://m.imgur.com/v3gDEz9), the Ptolemaic army was outfitted in the traditional Macedonian style so all of the soldiers from Egypt should look like hoplites not ancient Egypt cosplayers. \n\nAlso, why was Egyptian beer easier to drink in the Hellenistic period than the Dynastic? Because in the Hellenistic they started producing hop-*lites*. [*rimshot*]\n\n0:22:00 Agrippa is way too old in this movie, he looks almost as old as Caesar but was actually around the same age as his grand-nephew Octavian.\n\n0:31:00-0:32:30 How nice of Rufio and the rest of Caesar's lieutenants to have compiled a video-game style character info sheet about Cleopatra for him, except that it is [*gasp*] badhistory, *shocking* I know. First of all he gives Cleopatra and her family some context by pointing that they are in fact of Macedonian origin, even though an educated and political man like Caesar (who was an Alexander the Great fanboy) should definitely know this already. There is more that is wrong with this Caesarpedia entry, because Rufio says that she has been \"*known to employ torture poison and even her own sexual talents which are said to be considerable. I am told her lovers are listed more easily by number than by name. It is said that she chooses, in the manner of a man, rather than wait to be chosen in the womanly fashion.*\" But there are no sources mentioning any affairs outside of Caesar or (after this scene is set) Marc Antony, with the exception of the inherent implication whenever Caesarion's paternity is questioned. So excepting negative evidence (the absence of proof that this is *not* true) I can find nothing to substantiate this comment which implies a fairly well-known and, if Rufio is to be believed, long track record that contemporary sources unanimously fail to mention.\n\n0:33:20 Although it has long been speculated that Julius Caesar suffered some affliction and many extant sources state that he suffered from epilepsy this is often doubted by scholars. Is it possible? Yes, but not probable.\n\n0:35:45 Hmm, I hate to be that one redditor in every thread, but why is Lotus the handmaiden East-Asian? Do not get me wrong there was definitely *some* contact between the Far East and the Mediterranean but no substantial slave trade, and hell, they could have made her Indian and that would have made perfect sense because Egypt was the *primary* point for Indian trade in the Mediterranean (Berenike, Philoteras, Leukos Lymen and Myos Hormos being the primary Red Sea ports and IIRC Greek and Roman navigators mastered the monsoon season for India bound voyages around this time.)\n\nAt this point I want to talk a little while about the set and prop design for this movie. At 0:34:00 and 0:51:25 We see realistic, wax/papier-mâché fashion mannequins of the type that were not used until the late 19th century and have no place in Cleopatra's make-up room. And I am being generous because these mannequin heads are obviously made of either plastic or fiberglass which is *really* bad historical accuracy. Not to mention that a surprising amount of the interior and furniture of Cleopatra's living spaces (namely the palace and barge sets) looked old, too old, like literal Old Kingdom old. And as it turns out I was right, in the film's trivia it mentions that much of the furniture and statues are copies of relics the tomb's of Hetepheres and Tutankhamun, what it does not mention is that countless others mime the same styles/materials. Now the Ptolemaic dynasty and Cleopatra VII in particular might have leaned towards the antiquarian (namely New Kingdom influenced) when it came to Egyptian art and architecture in certain contexts (like temple complexes and monuments) but the vast preponderance of Cleopatra's place should be decked out with modern Hellenistic style in the interior.\n\n0:44:30 Oh no, Sosigenes (a Hellenic astronomer living before Christianity) did not just mention the \"the Testament of the Hebrew God\" which is presumably the Septuagint and then reverently call it the \"Book of Books\". In the First Century BC Greek scholars were *not* fawning over Jewish history and/or religious and spiritual texts and there are countless other literary works this guy should be concerned about or consider the jewel of the Library besides the testament of the god that is not his.\n\n0:43:55 - 0:47:00 God help me, Cleopatra was not even *in* Alexandria when the Great Library and parts of the Harbour area caught fire and this whole chain of events is happening entirely out of sequence, and contrary to popular belief the Library was not completely destroyed although it did apparently sustain a decent amount of damage and was renovated along with much of Alexandria but no one talks about the \"The Destruction of Alexandria\" because that too would be an exaggeration. So this *entire* scene is an inaccuracy. I also want to point out that it is *super* anachronistic when she makes the comment to Caesar \"-tear pyramids to the ground-\" because as reddit is so fond of saying she was born closer to Apollo 11 than the creation of the pyramids. I mean, she could just be being slightly more melodramatic than usual, and arguably saying that Romans would probably have no qualms about destroying them does not necessarily mean that they were built in her time but it sort of implies it the way it is said.\n\n0:56:30 In this film Pothinus is executed because he is implicated in Lotus' attempt to poison Cleopatra, but in actuality there is no reason to suspect that this was why he was executed. In *Di Bello Alexandrini* it is said that\n&gt;Whilst the enemy was thus employed, Pothinus, tutor to the young king, and regent of the kingdom, who was in Caesar's part of the town, sent messengers to Achillas, and encouraged him not to desist from his enterprise, nor to despair of success; but his messengers being discovered and apprehended, he was put to death by Caesar. \n\nMeanwhile in Plutarch's account it says\n&gt; A festival was kept to celebrate this reconciliation, where Caesar's barber, a busy, listening fellow, whose excessive timidity made him inquisitive into everything, discovered that there was a plot carrying on against Caesar by Achillas, general of the king's forces, and Pothinus, the eunuch. Caesar, upon the first intelligence of it, set a guard upon the hall where the feast was kept, and killed Pothinus. Achillas escaped to the army, and raised a troublesome and embarrassing war against Caesar-\n\nSo in neither of these places do we have any mention of an attempt to kill Cleopatra (although I have no doubt he probably did want her dead on account of that whole civil war business) but in both cases some deceit and a plot with Achillas against Caesar who promptly has him killed as well as Pothinus having a track record of disrespecting him like that time he gave Caesar's men mouldy grain. So we can assume that he died because he stepped on Caesar's toes a time too many and yes, there is always the possibility that Cleopatra might have also wanted Caesar to kill him but that is only a possible reason among many when we have several other documented reasons to choose from.\n\n0:57:15 So, the Alexandrinian wars are over? No Ptolemy getting captured then telling everyone that Caesar and his sister/wife were getting it on, no [Arsinoe IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_IV_of_Egypt)? That...is just unacceptable, really. Not to mention this gives the impression that this unfolded rather quickly while the conflict actually dragged on for months and was full of intrigues.\n\n1:00:00 Now by this point in the movie I can say that [Ptolemy XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIV_of_Egypt) does not appear since Cleopatra says that he has made her \"*sole ruler of Egypt.*\" And for whomever does not know Ptolemy XIV was the younger brother of Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII who I have been referring to as simply Ptolemy. After her restoration to power she married Ptolemy XIV to cement her claim to the throne and maintain the tradition of brother/sister marriage and co-regency (although given his age of around 12 and her continued uh, affiliation with Caesar it is considered unlikely to have been consummated) this made her not only successor to her father but legally married to the only other heir apparent. He also died a few months after [Caesar was assassinated](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/uncyclopedia/images/1/12/Stab.gif/revision/latest?cb=20081129222821) (Oh, spoiler alert. Also Vader is Luke's dad) from either illness or Cleopatra poisoning him so Caesarion could have the title of co-regent, which makes his absence a rather significant omission. Does it really matter to the general plot of the film and would it have added bloat to an already overstuffed film? Yeah, but is this /r/badscreenwriting?\n\n1:01:00 This scene is heavily implied to be the first time that Caesar and Cleopatra have sex but this takes place *after* the close of the Alexandrinian wars and the problem is Plutarch heavily implies that they became lovers the same evening that they met and although Plutarch is known to embellish from time to time in his \"*Lives*\" series, it is usually agreed that this would have to have occurred within a rather short time period and in any case the scandal of their affair was an issue *during* the Alexandrian conflict as well as afterwards and you do not usually get the scandal *before* the affair now do you? And if we accept the birth date of Caesarion as late June 47 BCE as some scholars do, his conception can be tentatively placed around November of 48 and given that none of the many extant Roman sources which express doubt as to his paternity mention dating discrepancies it would have to have been believed that Caesar and Cleopatra were already having an affair around that time. This clashes with the film's chronology since Caesar landed in Egypt around mid-September, the Siege of Alexandria did not even end until January of 47, and the Battle of the Nile was not fought until February. And all of the surviving secondary sources imply that they were having an affair right before or around the time he took her cause and draw a causative link between the two things, so we pretty much have no reason *not* to believe that was the case. That said, as I have already pointed out the Alexandrian conflict itself is not happening in correct sequence including Cleopatra's arrival in Alexandria and Caesar's final departure from Egypt and the conflict's duration is greatly diminished, so if we adjust for this it *does* make a lot more sense to this movie's timeline but that does not excuse it for being way off the mark historically, it just makes it part of a larger web of inaccuracy.\n\nRoughly 1:02:00 [What is even happening with this coronation?](http://m.imgur.com/4gnqhSk) I think that is a giant bird statue and I have no idea why this is happening in front of a mob of peasants and Roman troops, why Julius Caesar is involved in this, where this is happening, the anachronistic clothes/props, or even where *I* am right not because this movie is slowly destroying neurons in my brain. \n\n1:05:00 This scene here is a gold mine of pedantic corrections, as I pretty much expected, once again expositional dialogue will reveal *more* badhistory. You see when Cleopatra asks Caesar \"*Calpurnia is your...third wife is it?*\" she is right but then he goes on to correct her by saying \"*Fourth.*\" which is of course wrong as he was married to Cornelia, Pompeiia and Calpurnia which is 3, so how did this mistake even happen? They had the *right* answer. \nFunnily enough, Cleopatra asks Caesar about the relative loyalty of one of his lieutenants as she has never heard of him. This side chatter between them is fine if pointless with the exception of the fact that she should *probably* remember this one's name since she actually met Marc Antony when he came as part of a Roman military intervention to restore her (rather ineffective) father to the throne which is not really something a person just forgets in the space of a few years. And further, he says \"*If anyone in the world, I trust Antony*\" which I somehow doubt given that Antony just screwed up the situation in Italy during his governorship for pretty much no other reason besides not wanting to pass an law offering debt forgiveness in the wake of the war (that would have helped out Caesar) and that he believed (true or not) that Dolabella, who wanted to force the law into effect had slept with his soon-to-be-ex-wife Antonia Hybrida. That guy in addition to having a bad reputation, zero decision making skills and an alcohol problem has just plunged Italy into anarchy *while* the civil war was still very much in effect throughout the provinces which is why he actually fell out of favour with Caesar around this time. \n\nAnd oh great, we have some dialogue which heavily implies that if Julius Caesar had a son with Cleopatra it would provide him with a legitimate heir but no that is not true at all. At all. See, even if Caesarion were *not* illegitimate (his parents *were* married at the time, just not to each other :-|) he would still have been born to a foreign mother which makes him not a Roman citizen by birth and pretty much means that he would not be getting much support for any claims he might make on paternity which is in itself assuming that Caesar had ant intentions to recognize Caesarion or make him his heir since there is little reason to believe that was in any way the case. This whole conversation seems to have been the writers thoroughly abusing their creative license at our expense.\n\nAt 1:12:32 there is some dialogue which heavily implies that Cleopatra has designs for world domination and she even says \"One world, one nation one people\" and implies that Alexandria ought to be its capital as Alexander would have wanted. Historically, there is no reason to suspect that this was the case with Cleopatra. In actuality it is likely that she wanted to recreate the Ptolemaic Empire at its height and also welcomed additions from what had been the Seleucid Empire, ambitions which became apparent at the Donations of Antioch and the [Donations of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donations_of_Alexandria) respectively, as she laid hands on the titles to Cyrene, Cyprus, Syria, Cilicia, Libya, Phoenicia, Media, Armenia and Parthia granted to her and her children but this is a far cry from world domination giving that it looked something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donations_of_Alexandria#/media/File:Donations_of_Alexandria_34BC.gif) and keep in mind that Media and Parthia were not yet conquered and the lightest sections were *not* \"donated\" and that these territories were all possessions of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties in the past which is relevant only in showing that these ambitions do not come from nowhere.\n\nWhat we are then left with is imagining the intentions of Cleopatra in order to ascertain whether or not she actually *wanted* world domination but could not manage it, and frankly without any real reason to think that was the case more than there is for any other ambitious Hellenistic monarch I do not see the purpose of such a hypothetical exercise. In fact, Cleopatra's most pretentious epithets such as \"Queen of Kings\" with \"King of Kings\" having been used by the Arsacid and Achaemenid Persian dynasties, and titles like \"dominion from Ethiopia to India\", living divinity, \"mother of Ra/mother of Horus\", \"incarnation of (insert-deity-here)\", were used by Lagide  rulers before her and without any reason to think otherwise we have to assume they held the same symbolic value as they did for everyone else and that the powerful propaganda and symbolic concept of limitless rule, universal harmony and world empire did not suddenly become more sinister or realistic in this one instance. What I am basically trying to convey is that Cleopatra is no more similar to Darth Sidious than Ptolemy II or Ptolemy III, and Antiochus III or Antiochus IV and that this scene is overly dramatic and not based in reality.\n\n1:13:25 Is-is [Marc Antony seriously casually driving a *chariot* down the street](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1963_Cleopatra_trailer_screenshot_2.jpg)? Chariots were never used in Rome as a regular method of transportation, I know the writers just thought it would look cool but it makes absolutely no sense and for my sanity I will assume this to be some drunken antic instead of terribly clichéd bad history. Wait, why is Antony even here sympathising with her, how well did he even know Calupurnia that this would be appropriate or reasonable, not to mention he has his own problems to deal with while he waits for Caesar to get home as I have already pointed out, so it was not Caesar's reputation or marriage he was concerned with, his career very nearly died at this time even ignoring his divorce from Antonia and marriage to Fulvia. \n\nBut this is all without addressing the most egregious mistake of all, and that is that Caesar and Cleopatra =/= married. It seems unlikely that the two would do something so scandalous without any clear benefit, and there is a decisive lack of evidence that the two were wed. Not to mention that it really does not make any sense given that she quickly entered into a nominal marriage with Ptolemy XIV, so you know, she was *already married* and although men in Egypt might marry multiple wives, having it the other way around was not practiced. And the consensus among historians has been fairly consistently and unanimously that Cleopatra and Julius Caesar never married so I am confident to say that this is a stupid plot point in the film and a stupid theory when it enters academia. Although, I am glad that film acknowledges that this would not have been recognised under Roman law, that saves a lot of headache.\n\n\n1:17:58 Liz Taylor is the only actor in this movie who alternates between pronouncing it \"Isis\", \"I-sees\", \"Iss-uss\" and \"Iss-ees\" throughout this movie which is not too historically accurate I would imagine given how important Isis was to Cleopatra and her whole living divinity claim. In fact, the variations on the name Isis are more properly Iset, Aset etc but in any case pronouncing it would not have been some trying task for anyone living in Egypt.\n\n1:17:25 [*sigh*] Caesar was not in Egypt when Caesarion was born, Cleopatra was still pregnant when he left to finish tying up the loose ends of the Civil War (you know, the game-changing war that divided the Republic and is the catalyst for most of this film &gt;.&lt;) if we assume that Caesarion was born in June 47 BCE, (the stela supposedly listing his birth date may not mean what some scholars suggest and it is indeed possible that it does not even belong to the reign of Cleopatra and Caesarion) like Wikipedia apparently does. Plutarch is somewhat vague and possibly contradictory when describing Caesarion as in his \"*Life of Caesar*\" he states\n&gt;Upon this, he left Cleopatra queen of Egypt, who soon after had a son by him, whom the Alexandrians called Caesarion, and then departed for Syria.\n\nBut in \"Life of Marc Antony\" he simply says:\n&gt;Caesarion was believed to be a son of **the former Caesar, by whom Cleopatra was left pregnant**.\n\nWhich some scholars have suggested implies that Caesarion was born *after* Caesar's assassination but I do not quite buy this. Suetonius kind of reinforces that he was born before she visited Rome when he says\n&gt;He afterwards invited her to Rome, whence he sent her back loaded with honours and presents, and gave her permission to call by his name a son,\n\nThe salient point is he was *definitely* not born before Caesar left Egypt and *probably* born before she went to Rome with it being *possible* that he was born sometime after she returned to Egypt. \n\n1:18:30 Yeah, no the Romans did not have any laws that meant that if a free Roman man picked up an infant they became his legitimate citizen child, Rufio keeps running his mouth but seems to know nothing about the laws or customs of his homeland or really anything for that matter. *That* is actually the most ridiculous thing in this movie. Caesar never had a Lion King moment with Caesarion and in all likelihood never acknowledged him.\nIt is actually really strange that something so inaccurate would be a recurring plot point but it is for a more recent and inaccurate example of this and also a Lion King moment, see HBO's *Rome*. Between that and the idiotic baby-citizen law this whole scene is an inaccuracy.\n\n1:23:00 This film implies that Caesar gave Ptolemy XV the nickname \"little Caesar\" but it was in fact the Alexandrian people who decided to name after a surprisingly terrible American pizza chain and dubbed him \"Caesarion\".\n\nAt 1:24:25 exactly, some idiot tells Caesar to hurry because \"-the tides will soon be against you.\" But the Mediterranean sea has relatively low tides, what Julius Caesar did complain about and apparently cited as a reason for his dalliance in Egypt was that the *winds* would be against him and make sailing difficult but firstly this was as an excuse to stay *longer* and secondly winds =/= tides so that is just bad sailing. If the tide is against you the sea itself is pulling you back and tides are pretty much punctual and consistent in their coming and by this period in history had already been connected to the lunar cycle but the winds make *sailing* specifically difficult and are more fickle than the tides usually are. Obviously.\n\n1:30:00 Cleopatra, given that she was a foreigner and specifically a foreign *ruler*, never entered the Roman Forum and she would not have been allowed to cross the Pomerium which is why she did not enter the proper municipality of Rome but what you might call the greater urban area. Neither did she stay at the official residence of Caesar as it was the Domus Publica and yeah, that also would certainly not have been allowed, so this whole scene and the sequence it belongs in is an inaccuracy. Both her, Caesarion and Ptolemy XIV actually stayed at Julius Caesar\"s villa outside of the city.\n\n1:32:00-1:34:00 Wow, this scene really drives home how underrated the expeditions Cleopatra underwent to get these [dancers from West Africa](http://m.imgur.com/6hiunRs) are when considering trade between North and Sub-Saharan Africa. Come to think of it she deserves more credit for dragging a [sphinx all the way to Rome just for this extravagant and insane parade](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1963_Cleopatra_trailer_screenshot_(52)). Or, I suppose it is always possible that the filmmakers did not distinguish between North-Eastern and West African culture when casting and designing costumes/props as well as embellishing scenes like this for the purpose of impressing the audience with a grand display. And I mean, Africa is Africa amirite?\n\n1:35:00 In this scene [Cleopatra crosses under the Arch of Constantine](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1963_Cleopatra_trailer_screenshot_(3)) that will not be erected for 3 centuries, proving that *Time* itself as well as the Sahara is no match for her personality. Also in every shot of Rome we see ourselves surrounded by marble when in fact it was by this time dominated by brick with marble mostly adorning the houses of the wealthy but not even the temples or public buildings yet. Augustus would be seriously offended. \n\n1:36:00-1:37:00 Dammit, the magical aging lead in the water has affected Caesarion because he has grown to age 6 in just a few months! Unless, of course he is like the magically growing kid from Twilight but since I did not see anyone that looked like a shirtless heroin addict around Cleopatra so far he probably is not half-vampire  meaning this movie's timeline is once again screwed. (disclaimer: I did not see Twilight but I do know that there was a poorly rendered CG child in one)\n\n1:39:49 This whole scene of Caesar spending father/son time with a Caesarion that looks at least 7 even though the Ides of March happened when he was just a baby. Also the child actor playing Caesarion has such a thick Italian/Portuguese? accent in this scene and just reminded me that like in all vintage films about ancient Rome, the Romans have British accents which is not technically badhistory since they can not really have a film in Classical Latin, Koine or Attic Greek but it accidentally makes this scene hilarious when their accents clash.\n\n1:51:08 Caesar never declared himself to be a god, he claimed descent from Aeneas the legendary Trojan demi-god and son of Venus and he associated himself with Venus on coinage and by dedicating a temple to Venus Genitrix but he never declared *himself* to be a god. \n\nAlso, yes he had the title of Imperator but this did not have the same meaning as Emperor, and he never actually declared himself King of Rome or of the Roman Empire although he did hold many of the political and religious powers that the kings of Rome held and he intended to conquer Parthia which was prophesied to be a task that could only be accomplished by a king. Then we have that little episode where Marc Antony kept offering him a crown during Lupercalia *but* he refused it and whether or not the event was staged it did demonstrate his unwillingness to assume kingship.\n\n1:58:00 - 2:00:35 Oh. *my*. *GOD*. I was wrong when I said that the cult of Isis was not like something out of *Game of Thrones* because Cleopatra's ability to see prophetic images in the fire puts Melisandre to *shame*, I mean the assassination of Caesar is in such high definition and we even get sound!\n\nSeriously though, (disclaimer) there is no evidence that the goddess Isis actually did work magic in Antiquity or that sooth-saying, prophecies or visions were real and even if they were I have never heard that Cleopatra supposedly had one about the Ides of March. IIRC Calpurnia did, but not Cleopatra so in any case this is bad legend and bad history. Also, ominous priestess is ominous, I love how dramatic and corny she gets (not really).\n\n2:04:00 Low hanging fruit, I know, but statues in ancient Rome were not usually left unpainted.\n\n2:06:11 Marc Antony asks \"*If Caesar had been made king, do you believe he would still have named Octavian (his heir)?*\" And uh, yes.\n\n2:07:00 *Whoa*, this movie needs to slow *down*. First of all, I have said it before, no way did Caesarion have any legitimate claims over Octavian and secondly, why would Marc Antony, who had a stake in Caesar's inheritance and wanted it for himself instead of Octavian want to support Caesarion's at this early point? At this time he was trying to hold onto as much of Caesar's inheritance as he could and did not start actively supporting Caesarion's claims for another 8 or so years.\n\n\n\n*And* this is where I am leaving off, because it is actually an intermission in the film. To recap, Caesar is dead, Cleopatra has returned to Egypt and I am tired. Hopefully I will find to time to finish part 2 soon but no promises.\n\n**Sources of fuel for my tirade:**\n\n* [Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Egypt_in_the_Age_of_Cleopatra.html?id=a5U-8b-fVNgC&amp;redir_esc=y) and [Cleopatra: Beyond the Myth](https://www.amazon.com/Cleopatra-Beyond-Myth-Michel-Chauveau/dp/0801489539) by Michel Chauveau.

        "text": "[Bad Boston Tea Party/American Revolution History](https://www.facebook.com/GianniScalise1/posts/10207030168066683).\n\nI must say before I begin, I'm better versed in the military history of the American Revolution, so forgive me if I make a terrible mistake on a bad history subreddit, or if I leave an important piece out, but this meme is bad history, so here we go!\n\nI start with the first sentence, \"look at these crybaby losers\", well if you know anything about a monarchy, you will know that these people, led by the famous Sons of Liberty did not technically lose in this situation, because simply their King was a King, not an elected official. Even the governor of Massachusetts was appointed by the British, or more specifically by King George III. Of course, the monarchy had been the government of Britain and other important 18th century countries such as France and Spain. Which means a challenge (like a Revolution)  to the type of government that has been in place for centuries is quite significant, and even supports the OP's claim in the meme. \n\nHowever, bad history often comes with leaving out important details! In order to give these details, here are a [list of grievances!](http://patriotsline.com/how-well-do-you-actually-know-the-declaration-of-independence/the-declaration-of-independence-the-grievances/) These certain grievances are from a future president and prove that the colonies were not only frustrated over \"taxation without representation\", but 26 other issues as well. \n\nPerhaps I haven't done a great job explaining why this meme is bad history just yet though. The innocent people with the \"private property\" is in fact the property of the East India Tea Company, which according to Brittanica, was a company formed by a royal charter, which delved into British imperialism in India, and British politics, so no, this is a bit more powerful of a company than your 21st century Starbucks. Essentially they had a monopoly of tea throughout the British rule, and this tea was tied into the British government, meaning, a raid on their tea in the Boston Harbor is a powerful political statement, and is a destruction of British government property, as well as East India Tea Company's property.\n\nThe jobs comment struck me as well, OP is obviously trying to get a 21st century spin on the Boston Tea Party, but let's analyze the three main organizers of the Boston Tea Party. The first is Paul Revere, not necessarily a man without a job, Revere was one of the most well regarded silversmiths or goldsmiths in the colonies at the time. The next organizer is Sam Adams, perhaps known to OP as a modern day beer maker, but instead, he was a successful New England political leader, or rabble rouser, depending on how you view him. William Molineax is a bit lesser known, but was a successful merchant, so again, not really truthful. \n\nI must mention before I finish, that yes, I know I left out the Tea Act, the Townsend Acts, and other Acts by the British, but I think President Jefferson gave us a decent amount of information as to why the colonials were pretty upset over British rule, even if his grievances were announced three years later.",

This earns the movie the ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm).\n\n28.48: It is a little-known fact that the Romans refused to remove their armour and wore it all the time.\n\n29.00 In the time of Caesar the standard Roman tool for measuring distances was a crossbow bolt attached to a rope. \n\n29.35: The Roman Scutum was also the primary means of moving heavy blocks of stone.\n\n30.06: I should probably be drunk right now but I don't know enough about Roman engineering to identify all the errors.\n\n33.20: The Romans are practicing to the pace of drums whilst engaging in synchronized HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING. According to Vegetius, Roman training consisted of marching and sparring against pells with wooden swords and wicker shields that were twice the weight of regular Roman equipment. DRINK!\n\n33.52: I could die of alcohol poisoning just by list all the individual mistakes here:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/eMeMS\n\nLet's see, the shields are covered with so much metal they would weigh too much to be used in battle, and the Romans are carrying spears were spears were only used by auxilliaries by this date, not legionnaires. Also, the blades of the spears *are as long as gladius themselves*, which would make them too slow and forward-heavy to be a viable weapon. DRINK!\n\n34.24: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n35.16: HOLLYWOOD COMBAT SPIN! DRINK!\n\n37.57: And by working together, the city is complete. I guess friendship is magic after all.\n\n38.27: It was a tradition in the ancient world that, upon a construction project being finished, everbody would divide into two large groups and then run towards one another, cheering and hugging. In slow motion.\n\n43.03: John Cusak served under Consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives. This is obviously meant to represent Marcus Crassus, and in the movie he formed an alliance with the Parthian queen. There are several problems with this. First, Crassus tried to conquer Parthia, not make a treaty with them. Second, Parthia was not ruled by a queen, but an emperor. DRINK!\n\n43.11: The Parthian queen is also the sister of the wife of Crassus, despite their not being any records of marriage between the Parthian ruling family and Roman patrician families. DRINK!\n\n43.15: Crassus also has an elder son, Tiberius Crassus (Adrien Brody), whilst the historical Crassus had two sons, Publius and Marcus. DRINK!\n\n43.48: The movie states that the consulship was an inherited position, and that one of the sons of Crassus would have suceeded him. The consuls (of which there were two) were actually elected by an assembly. The consuls also had to be at least 43 years old and held other positions in the Roman government. DRINK!\n\n43.40: It turns out Tiberius Crassus killed his father. Marcus was killed by the Parthians, not his brother. Also, the Romans placed *a lot* of importance on blood relationships, which was reflected in the Twelve Tables:\n\nhttp://www.constitution.org/sps/sps01_1.htm\n\nOne law states:\n\n\"Anyone who kills an ascendant, shall have his head wrapped in a cloth, and after having been sewed up in a sack, shall be thrown into the water\"\n\nSince the ascendant would be defined as a father or grandfather, Tiberius would have been sentenced to death for murdering his father, the Pater Familias. DRINK!\n\n44.07: The Parthian version of the treaty looks like it was written in Arabic:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/v1upT\n\nCan anyone confirm it so I can take a drink?\n\n45.56: FANTASY ROMAN SWORD!

        "text": "So I made the mistake of wandering into /r/KotakuInAction and came across this thread, where apparently the fight for ethics in video game journalism has been going on for over a century. But the strangest thing throughout the thread (apart from the opposition to women voting) was the recurring belief that women somehow wanted and gained from WW1.\n\n&gt; [\"And one of the first things they voted for was a war in which only men and teenage boys fought.\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5nj51p/on_10th_march_1914_first_wave_feminist_and/dcbyxa5/)\n\nThis is complete nonsense. Full suffrage didn't come until **after** the war, it was very limited before the war, not nearly enough to sway the whole country. There's also the obvious fact that all the politicians, leaders and people in a position of power were male, so it's unclear how women could have forced them to go to war. (Someone does point out that the only congresswoman voted against the war). Literally every decision maker was male, so it was men who decided to go to war. The same is true for the rest of Europe, where women couldn't vote and men decided to go to war.\n\nBut there's more:\n\n&gt; [Men actually aren't guaranteed the right to vote, at least in the U.S. Women have the right to vote and can exercise it at 18 with no strings attached. But men only gain the ability to vote in return for signing up for the draft.\nIn other words, men have privileges----But women have rights.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5nj51p/on_10th_march_1914_first_wave_feminist_and/dccpe1v/)\n\nThis is completely untrue. The right to vote is protected and it is unrelated to the draft. White male suffrage dates back to the 1830s, but the draft wasn't introduced until the Civil War, 30 years later. There was no permanent draft, instead new laws would be introduced whenever there was a major war. If the draft gave someone the right to vote, then why (until the 1970s) was the minimum voting age 21 but the minimum draft age 18? A seriously complaint during Vietnam was that the soldiers were too young to vote and decide about the war (but old enough to die for it).\n\nThen there's the misconception that the only war to contribute to the country is by fighting for it. Paying taxes arguably supports the country as much as signing up to be drafted for a war that may never occur. There's also the point that the draft has been abolished yet voting rights remain. Most countries in the world give women the right to vote despite not having a draft.\n\n&gt; [Women already had the right to vote, under lighter conditions than men did. If a woman owned property, she could vote. A man had to both own property and agree to selective service.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5nj51p/on_10th_march_1914_first_wave_feminist_and/dcc8489/)\n\nNope, just wrong\n\n&gt; [the suffragettes motive for the white feather campaign was to make young men die.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5nj51p/on_10th_march_1914_first_wave_feminist_and/dcc8w0t/)\n\nThis ignores the point that men were just as supportive of the war and as likely to shame non-enlisted men. It also assumes that all women are feminists and all white feather-ites were suffragettes (and vice versa). Basically the idea that men only fought in WW1 was because feminists shamed them is pure bad history.\n\nOk so this post has gone on for longer than the fight against feminism, but let me finish with one comment that is a grand slam of bad history, politics, philosphy, civics, ethics and just about everything else. It's just plain bad.\n\n&gt; [Men being expendable is part and parcel of feminism at it's core. They felt that men weren't sacrificing enough for women, and tried to shame them into going off to war to die. A lot of them just wanted to make life for lower-class men more unpleasant, hence the overlap with the temperance movement. Then later when you get gender studies departments being set up at universities there's calls for the percentage of men to be reduced by 90%, likely through extermination. There's always been this current in feminism that's just about nigh-genocidal hatred of men.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5nj51p/on_10th_march_1914_first_wave_feminist_and/dccsuuw/)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5q9z26/revisiting_česlovas_gedgaudas_and_searching_for/",
        "text": "Last year, [about three months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/594c14/%C4%8Deslovas_gedgaudas_a_baltic_state_has_existed_for/), I rambled a bit about Česlovas Gedgaudas and how his book is the best thing since sliced kibinas. However, I fear that many of you got the wrong idea on just how *funny* this book is.\n\nThis is because I didn't post a single excerpt from that book. A mistake that I am here to fix. This is actually one of my favorite chapters, because it doesn't deal with ear linguistics, relithuanization or Aryan religion bullshit. It's called \"The Darkest Hour of the Crown of the Two Seas\" (I swear, it's not as long in Lithuanian), and it deals which what exactly happened during the so-called \"beginning of Lithuanian history according to Polish historians\".\n\nGedgaudas really hates Poles. Especially Henryk Łowmiański. Whenever he mentions that name, he has to say something bad about his work.\n\nAnyway:\n\n&gt;The Empire, oblivious to all that was happening outside it's borders, was drowning in a sea of fratricidal blood. Why the Great Crown separated into the Rasan southern, Slavicized and Christianized part, and the Aryan religion following northern one, we can only explain using geophysics.\n\nAryan religion = the ancient Baltic pagan faith. I'll explain why he calls it like that later.\n\n&gt;See, those two halves differ heavily in their nature and climate: in the south - steppe, in the north - impenetrable forests, and for thousands of years only the unity of the Amber Road united them. The natural border between these two worlds went more or less in a Lublin, Chernigov, Kursk and Voronezh line and on this border, set by nature itself, the bloodiest battle boiled from the 10th century.\n\n[Here is that line for unknowledged Westerners.](http://i.imgur.com/ZYWfmqB.png)\n\nThe question that arises is this - weren't there Christian regions north of that line as well? Wasn't Saint Vladimir, the guy which we will soon learn about, from north of that line, too? This whole \"south is steppe and Christian, north is forest and Aryan\" doesn't really make sense to me.\n\n&gt;When in the year 998 Vladimir persuaded the Great Crown of Kiev to Christianity, he got the title of Saint, even though he was a fratricidal maniac, a bastard, and a despicable rapist who had over 900 concubines.\n\n...\n\nYeah, uh, [citation needed]. Lots. Or at least any reason for overplaying it.\n\nAlso, got the date wrong (988, not 998), and he didn't \"persuade\" Kiev to become Christian, he converted and converted his people because he was their Prince.\n\nHowever, this easily shows the biggest \"quality\" of Gedgaudas's work - he is a neo-pagan. He believed that ancient Lithuanian paganism was the right religion - the religion of the ancestors, and Christianity was evil, despicable, the Pope murderous, and everyone who converted to it were either evil or stupid.\n\nAnd he made up a bunch of shit on what he believed ancient Baltic rituals to be, there's a whole section of the book about it.\n\n10/10 so far.\n\n&gt;Incredibly angry, the noble North decided to stop listening to him completely, and the furious Vladimir tried to force it to kneel via war. When the Nemunas basin, as we saw, managed to stop the Slavicized Rasan waves, covering the shores of the river with their bones, the Dauguva basin developed in a much sadder fashion. The crusader Vladimir defeated the Latvian armies, led by Vareika, and, after capturing Riga, slaughtered the entire old Baltic dynasty of the Rikvaldai family, though first raping the princess Rikneda in front of her parents' eyes. This was a grudge move: the princess, pushing back the matchmakers he sent, proudly stated: \"I will never wear a slave's boots\" (a hint about Vladimir's mother, Šventasaulavis's servant - Meilužė). This episode was extensively written about in the Primary Chronicle.\n\nIndeed, the story about Rogneda is in the Primary Chronicle. Her being Latvian and residing in Riga is something that was pulled from his ass, however. Especially since neither \"Riga\" nor \"Latvians\" existed at the time. The Primary Chronicle tells her to be from Polotsk, after all.\n\nAlso, about Malusha, Vladimir's mother. There is a lot of debate among historians over who she was. Was she of Norse origin or a local? Gedgaudas solved the mystery by saying that Malusha is just the word for \"lover\" in Lithuanian. 10/10.\n\n&gt;It was even worse in the south. The powerful nation of Jotvingiai (formerly referred to as Gepids), for centuries having ruled the whole central part of the Empire, holding the ancient path of the Amber Road (Vistula - Bug - Dnieper), were being pushed north by the Czech-Polish Slavs of Malopolska. At the times of Boleslaw and Kazimierz, the Jotvingiai resistance was finally broken; they lost most of their people and almost half of their southern lands, as well as the control of the Bug-Vistula path; Lietuvos Brasta (Brest) became only a Lithuanian location name, and the Amber Road was forced to move through the Nemunas.\n\nI have no idea why Gedgaudas thinks the Amber Road was still relevant in the 10th century despite being an ancient history thing for the most part, but ok. He overwanks the size of the Jotvingiai, basically saying that they held most of modern day Poland and Ukraine, but ok. Let's move on.\n\n&gt;That was not all. In the year 1168, the Danish king Voldemaras, having gathered 300 000 pirates with promises of divine bounty, attacked the biggest Aryan shrine in Arkona, in Rugija island, the capital of our Krivių Krivaitis, and burned it down after a year of siege. This was the greatest blow to not only Lithuania, but also to the leftover Aryan faith followers in many places in Europe. We cannot overestimate it's importance... Having lost their trust in their fallen Dievas, the Defender of the Flags of Victory, the Aryans begame an easy prey for Christianizers, even though the capital of the Krivių Krivaitis for some time still remained in Romuva, later in Vilnius.\n\nKrivių Krivaitis (Kriwe of Kriwes) was only mentioned once by Simon Grunau, in the 16th century, as a pagan Pope. It was a propaganda tool meant to make the Christians believe that the Baltic pagans are an organized and dangerous faith rather than a bunch of nature worshippers. Gedgaudas, obviously, was not aware of that. Not that he wanted to be aware of that.\n\nNow, about the looting of Arkona. Doesn't matter that the time of siege was actually just four weeks and that you couldn't find 300k pirates in the Baltic at any point in time. What strikes me is the inconsistency.\n\nLater on in the book, a few sections later, Gedgaudas talks about the Vikings, and that there is no way that the Vikings could have been Scandinavians (they were, of course, Lithuanians). According to him, Scandinavia could at best hold about 600 000 people during the Viking Era, far from enough to do any sort of meaningful conquest. Now, I know that 1168 is a few centuries after the end of the Vikings, but still, **where did the 300 000 soldiers appear from, then?** \n\nAnd they're all pirates, raiders. What, was every man in Denmark at the time a pirate or raider of some sort and then got enlisted into the raid on a small island? It's fucked up, man.\n\n&gt;Assessing the fact of the Volyn peace in 1219 (A: talked about in the chapter before this one.), we thus have to keep the very unfavorable situation for Lithuania in mind, one that forced the remnants of the Federation to forget their inner friction and unite, stepping over even the religious precipice between the North and the South. Those were the news of the darkest clouds, ones which would shock even the most selfish feudalist. Here's a bundle of them, far from a comprehensive one:\n\nThe 1219 peace is known in Lithuania as the first historical mention of Mindaugas, the first and only king of Lithuania, as well as proof of Lithuanian statehood (as a confederation of dukes) at the time. Outside of that, it really has nothing too interesting going for it.\n\nThere was a list of events here, but I skip it, because Gedgaudas gives a summary and also because they are all more or less accurate to history, albeit turned up to eleven and bashing Christians for being evil and plotting.\n\n&gt;In summary, the cross of the Papacy, the sword of the Western emperor and the coin of the Hansa made a worldwide plot for a united, destructive blow to Northern Lithuania. The first soldiers of this gigantic coalition, Danish pirates, attacked the coast of the Baltic with their powerful navy in the year 1219.\n\nI don't know why they're called \"pirates\", though. They were led by Valdemar II, who was the King of Denmark. No pirates mentioned there. But at least there was indeed a big Danish attack that year - big enough that it created both Tallinn and the Danish flag. But hey, if we get to call Estonia \"Northern Lithuania\", I'm all for it.\n\nAlso, I don't know about you, but being the target of a **worldwide** coalition makes me feel pretty good.\n\n&gt;But the most horrifying news came from the south: for the last few years, The Great Crown has been watching the campaigns of Genghis Khan with worry.\n\nActually, it was the east. /r/baddirections is that way.\n\n&gt;He, after uniting the entire continent of North Asia, gains the title of Great Khan in the year 1206 and doesn't even hide his ambition to conquer Europe, too.\n\nI didn't know North Asia is considered to be a continent. \n\nAlso, is it just me or is the order of events sort of mixed up here? Didn't Genghis become Khan first and only then start conquering Asia? Or is it just me?\n\n&gt;In the year 1218, he destroys the last source of opposition in Mongolia, the Qara-Khitai, and tears down the Khwarezm Empire in 1219, the last obstable between Asia and the Great Crown.\n\nFunny that he doesn't even mention China. And actually, Khwarezm was conquered a bit later, in [1219-1221](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquest_of_Khwarezmia). Also, I don't know about \"last obstacle\".\n\n[Here is Khwarezmia.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Khwarezmian_Empire_1190_-_1220_%28AD%29.PNG/300px-Khwarezmian_Empire_1190_-_1220_%28AD%29.PNG)\n\n[And here is the Great Crown, sometimes called the Empire of the Amber Road, or the Gardarikė Empire, or just Lithuania. Also the Empire of Varumonių Rikis.](http://www.sarmatas.lt/wp-content/uploads/zmlpstr.jpg)\n\nThere was still Volga Bulgaria to deal with, and the Caucasus. If you're writing what should've happened, at least make it logical, man.\n\n&gt;The scouts in the Ukrainian steppes already tell of the arriving front units of the Mongol army; it is said that the power of the Horde exceeds all that the world has ever seen: even Attila's 100 000 Huns or the 300 000 Danish bandits in Arkona are nothing compared to Genghis Khan's 1 000 000 men wave of wild barbarians.\n\nOne million.\n\nOne. Fucking. Million. Mongols. Invading. Wanked. Lithuania.\n\nI think I don't even need to explain.\n\nOne million. \n\nOne million.\n\n&gt;This is the catastrophic point in time which the Polish historians \"accidentally\" picked to try to prove our \"origin\".\n\nOh, right, Gedgaudas also bashes on Poles. Apparently they are trying to steal our history and prove that we are farmers from marshes who never accomplished anything expept being Poland.\n\nMmkay. One million.\n\n&gt;So, taking the horrible situation into account, the meaning of the peace with Volyn comes to light: - Brothers and cousins, in the face of danger of a final collapse, remember the covenant of our thousand-year old Federation, put small quarrels aside and create a Holy Peace. Thus, the dukes divided the fronts among themselves: Kievan Rasa mobilized against Genghis Khan, having a save rear, while the Baltic north gathered to push back the Teutonic, Danish and Polish invaders.\n\nSounds good. It's sad that it's not really true, though, because the Volyn peace only cared about the Crusader threat. Nobody really knew that Genghis Khan and his one FUCKING million Mongols are coming.\n\n&gt;This agreement has to be seen as the turning point of our history. From that point onward, the position of the North got better and better, especially when Mindaugas, temporarily elected as the main military leader, will use this opportunity to unite the fractured \"lands\", and after the fall of the Great Crown of Kiev, will take over that title as well, of which he was one of the claimants.\n\nFunny that he doesn't mention Mindaugas's convertion to Christianity and his subsequent coronation in the Catholic rite. Because no, we have to keep Mindaugas cool, right?\n\n&gt;Later the victories in Dorpat and Saule stop the Teutons for a longer period,\n\nExcept that both of those battles were won by Mindaugas's *enemies*, the Samogitians...\n\n&gt;and in the year 1262, right before Mindaugas's assassination, his armies, supporting a revolt in Prussia, flood the lands with three columns of men and reach as far as Frankfurt at Oder, which they capture.\n\nBullshit.\n\nYou made this up, don't lie. Mindaugas [did not participate in the Great Prussian Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_uprisings#The_Great_Prussian_Uprising_.281260.E2.80.931274.29), don't lie. They didn't raid as far as Oder, don't lie.\n\n&gt;Other units, led by his brother Tautvila\n\nNope. [Nephew.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautvilas)\n\n&gt;crush the Brothers of the Sword in Dorpat, and other forces at the same time beat the armies of the Order on the mouths of Daugava.\n\nDid he just... erase Alexander Nevsky's son from history and replace the historical raid on Dorpat that he led with a Lithuanian attack?..\n\nHell, where even is Nevsky, anyway? You could have relithuanized his name and made him a Lithuanian hero right about now. I'm disappointed, Mr. Gedgaudas.\n\n&gt;Earlier attempts by the Golden Horde to acquire tribute from Lithuania - as they saw Lithuania to be a part of the Great Crown that they conquered - were declined by Rimgaudas with contempt, returning Batu's ambassadors with chopped off ears, which obviously made the Horde furious and send a punishment expedition to Lithuania. The leader Skirmantas, meeting the Mongols at Kedainiuva (Kaidanovo), gave them such a hard blow that the Horde moved out of the conquered lands of Kiev and back to the Volga basin, where the many centuries long oppression of the Muscovite Russians began.\n\nWell, I can't find any information on who Skirmantas was and why is he there during the rule of Mindaugas and what was Kaidanovo, so I'll leave it here.\n\n&gt;*In the light of the fact that Lithuania survived and held against the organized attack of two continents, we are forced to accept and agree, that against those massive powers it managed to put up an equal or maybe even a somewhat greater strength.* Looking at this sensibly, the tale of a tiny country of two marshy counties and the appearance of Lithuania \"from nowhere\" vanishes.\n\n...\n\n[this is me right now](http://i.imgur.com/FdYoKPT.jpg)\n\n&gt;The Lithuania of Mindaugas and Vytautas, suddenly jumping into history out of nowhere, like Pilypas from hemp (A: Lithuanian saying), powerful and well armed from the start, magically pushing back armies of millions of professional murderers (which the Tatars were famous at), conquering a territory of 1 million sq. km. with 25 million inhabitants like nothing *is absolutely never explained in our history textbooks.*\n\nActually, no. You should read a history textbook sometimes. It was explained in the history books of your time as well. I've read a history textbook from the year 1926, shit's right there. Maybe not as much as today, because most of the things that we know hadn't been discovered yet (even the fact of Mindaugas's coronation was only revealed in the 1990s), but it's more than enough.\n\nWe don't need to make shit up for that. Like you just made up the 25 million number.\n\nAlso, the Mongol million is back. Woohoo.\n\n&gt;This \"oversight\" of theirs we'll fill up with usury in the fourth section of the book, \"Uncensored Past\".\n\nFuck no.\n\nI'm done here.\n\n---\n\n**SOURCES:**\n\nČeslovas Gedgaudas, \"Mūsų praeities beieškant\", published by Aušra, 1994 - pages 36-39.\n\n**The only source you ever need in life.**",

And rightfully so, according to M.A. Khan, a former Muslim who left the religion after realizing that it is based on forced conversion, imperialism, and slavery: the primary demands of Jihad, commanded by the Islamic God Allah.\n\n\"I should post this in /r/badhistory,\" he thought, and delved into the book.\n\n---\n\nEver curious about why Indonesia and Malaysia are majority Muslim?

Most of the bad history doesn't even have to do with making Islam look bad, it's just a series of basic errors that could have been corrected with a 10-second search on Wikipedia.\n\n\n[Map of Southeast Asia for reference.](http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/southeastasia/southeastasia-geography-map.jpg)\n\n&gt; During the thirteenth to fifteenth century, prior to the spread of Islam in Southeast Asia, there were\nthree powerful kingdoms in the region: Srivijaya (Malaysia), Majapahit (Indonesian archipelago) and Siam\n(Thailand).\n\nThere were many more than just three kingdoms in Southeast Asia at the time. In the Mainland (Indochina) alone there were some 23 independent kingdoms in the 14th century.^1 Perhaps Khan means that only these three qualified as \"powerful\" kingdoms? Even then this is incorrect. Srivijaya, Majapahit, and Thailand *were* powerful. But so was Vietnam, which was [arguably one of the world's first gunpowder empires](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ovkne/in_the_game_europa_universalis_iv_southeast_asia/dcmi647/).^2 It's impossible to argue that the two major kingdoms in Myanmar at the time, [Ava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ava) and [Pegu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanthawaddy_Kingdom), weren't powerful either.^3 I can't fathom any criteria for powerful-ness that would include just these three and exclude all others. \n\n[Srivijaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srivijaya) was not particularly \"powerful\" between the 13th and 15th centuries. It had been in slow decline arguably since 1025. By the 13th century it was commercially superseded by Java and under constant attack from Thailand to the north and Java to the south. Srivijaya was gone by the late 14th century.

But [Mr. Khan seems to have not consulted a simple map of Indonesia when writing this.](https://www-tc.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/indonesia605/images/indonesia_map_detail_lrg.jpg)\n\n&gt; After embracing Islam in 1410, Parameswara transformed the Hindu kingdom of Srivijaya into the Muslim Sultanate of Malacca.\n\nSrivijaya was gone in 1410. King [Parameswara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameswara_(king\\)) ruled the [kingdom of Melaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate)/Malacca, not Srivijaya.\n\n&gt;  Parameswara, now Sultan Iskandar Shah\n\n[Iskandar Syah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megat_Iskandar_Shah_of_Malacca) isn't the Muslim name of Parameswara, he's the *son* of Parameswara. No, Parameswara/Iskandar was not his own father. They were, in fact, two different people.\n\n&gt; The Sultanate expanded; at its height, it\nencompassed [...] Borneo. Later on, Borneo seceded from Malacca to become an independent Sultanate. \n\nMr. Khan appears to be confused about the fact that [Borneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo) is an *island.* An island cannot turn into a sultanate. The name of the sultanate is [Brunei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei).\n\nSecond, Brunei was never part of the sultanate of Melaka. It was its own independent country that frequently sent tribute missions to China, receiving lavish gifts and recognition from the Chinese emperor in return.^5 [Melaka's sphere of influence did not extend beyond Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Malacca_Sultanate_en.svg)\n\n&gt; In the course of the fifteenth century, the Sultanate of Malacca waged Jihad against neighboring states and destroyed the powerful Majapahit Kingdom and also weakened Siam [...]  The Sultanate continued its rivalry with the surviving Thai Kingdom, capturing territory from the south. In the course of late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, Muslim invaders were poised to storm into the Thai capital of Ayuthaya. For some time, it seemed that the Muslim holy warriors would overrun Siam. \n\nMajapahit was brought down by Muslims, yes. These Muslims were *not* from Melaka. They were based in the north coast of Java, the island where Majapahit was located. These coastal Muslims had close connections to Majapahit and Javanese culture, For example, consider [Demak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demak_Sultanate), the Muslim kingdom that finally destroyed Majapahit. Far from being a kingdom of fanatical savages, Demak was founded by a regional governor of Majapahit who had married a Majapahit princess and was himself possibly a member of the royal dynasty. The fall of Majapahit was more of a civil war than an invasion by foreign jihadists.^6\n\nWhile Melaka had initially accepted Thai overlordship, Thai kings feared that those Malays were becoming too uppity and *launched a major attack* on Melaka in 1455-1456. War resumed around 1490 when the sultan of Melaka attacked a Thai vassal. Clearly an example of Muslim aggression? Well, the area attacked was inhabited by Malay Muslims who were being economically exploited by Thailand. In 1497 a Buddhist vassal of Thailand was attacked, but then Thailand retaliated by invading the Malay Peninsula in the first decade of the 16th century.^7\n\nWhat I see here is an on-and-off war fought in largely Malay and Muslim territory, not a jihad that is about to destroy Thailand. I can't help but assume that if Thailand had been Muslim, Mr. Khan would have chosen Thai aggression toward Melaka as a prime example of fanatic Islamic holy war.\n\n&gt;  In the eighteenth century, Siam counterattacked in order to recover the lost territory. It overran and annexed the declining Muslim Sultanate of Pattani. \n\nMuslims attack a Thai vassal. Mr Khan: Islam is a horrifying death cult trying to destroy helpless little Thailand.\n\nThailand conquers a Muslim sultanate. Mr. Khan: See, conquest is justified because the Thai are \"recovering\" their \"lost territory.\" Never mind that [Patani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattani_Kingdom) had never before been directly controlled by Thailand...\n\n&gt;  Furthermore, the Islamic sanction that Muslim men can have up to four wives, engage in temporary marriages and keep unlimited concubines (sex-slaves) might have helped the Muslim population grow faster.\n\nMr. Khan seems unaware that men in Vietnam could also keep as many wives \"as many as their revenues will maintain,\" while polygamy was the norm among the Javanese elite both before and after Islam. In Javanese [*kakawin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakawin) poetry, the more wives a hero has, the greater he is. I mean, having four wives is practically monogamous compared to one Javanese hero who supposedly had a harem of 16,000 women. \n\nMost people were monogamous, sure, but most people were monogamous before Islam and after Islam. Anyways, most people were monogamous throughout the Islamic world, including in the Middle East (Islamic law makes polygamy very expensive and simple logic makes it unlikely that polygamy would be ever practiced by a large segment of the male population).^8\n\n&gt; Just four years after Parameswara's conversion to Islam, Ma Huan—the Chinese Muslim Dragoman—found him a \"very strict believer in the faith\". It means that he was strictly applying the Shafi’i laws in his Sultanate.\n\nNo, it doesn't mean that. All it means that a Chinese observer thought the sultan was a good Muslim. An Arab merchant arrived in the same city of Melaka 30 years later and said:\n\n&gt; &gt; What people. They have no culture at all. The infidel marries Muslim women while the Muslim takes pagans to wife. You do not know whether they are Muslim or not... The Muslim eats dogs for meat for there are no food laws. They drink wine in the markets and do not treat divorce as a religious act.^9\n\nMr. Khan is cherry-picking primary sources.\n\n&gt; [Khan's evidence that Islam was spread with violence] it could have...  was most likely... in all likelihood...\n\nThese, ladies and gentlemen, are what are called weasel words.\n\n&gt; The conversion of the otherwise resistant Southeast Asian infidels to Islam was much more complete than those of India within a much shorter time. [...] This suggests that a greater coercion was most likely applied in the conversion of the Hindu-Buddhist-Animist infidels of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines to Islam.\n\nNo, what it suggests is that popular religion wasn't dominated by Buddhism or the caste system like India or Myanmar was. [See my post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5o8avu/how_did_indonesia_and_malaysia_become/dchhhnq/) Persecution often makes people less willing to follow orthodox Islam (e.g. [the Meo of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meo_(ethnic_group\\))).\n\n&gt; It has been noted already that the ruthlessness that Islamic holy warriors exhibited in their campaigns\noften terrified the infidels into submission and acceptance of Islam. The Jihad incursions by Muslim rulers in\nSoutheast Asia were no less brutal and terrifying. Prof. Anthony Reid, who thinks that 'Islam was more\negalitarian' in Southeast Asia, notes: 'Malaya lost much of its population as a result of the campaigns (by\nMuslim ruler) of Aceh in the period of 1618–24.'\n\nThe Acehnese invasion of the Malay Peninsula in the 1620s were indeed terrifying. But the Acehnese were attacking places and peoples that *were already Muslim.* Mr. Khan seems to believe that Acehnese campaigns against other sultanates were \"brutal and terrifying Jihad incursions\" simply because the sultan of Aceh was Muslim and Islam was used to legitimize Aceh's campaigns. Let's see where this logic brings us:\n\nWW1 began when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. The Austrian emperor was a Catholic and said, [\"I trust in the Almighty to give the victory to my arms.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_my_peoples) Therefore WW1 was a brutal and terrifying Crusade incursion. Good to know. \n\n&gt;  Similarly, when Sultan Agung of Mataram, hailed as a\ngreat Muslim monarch of Southeast Asia, besieged Surabaya and its nearby towns with 80,000 troops for five\nyears (1620–25), his troops devastated all the rice crops and even poisoned water and stopped its flow to the\ncity by damming up the river. Consequent to these campaigns, all but 500 of the 50,000–60,000 inhabitants\nremained there; the rest had died or left the city from the resulting misery and famine.\n\n[Sultan Agung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Agung_of_Mataram) was hailed as a \"great Muslim monarch\" after his death. M. C. Ricklefs notes that \"the contemporary evidence for Sultan Agung's Islamic piety is thin.\"^10 More damningly, Surabaya was a significantly more devoutly Muslim place than Sultan Agung's court.\n\nAccording to Mr. Khan, one Muslim ruler destroying a more devout Muslim ruler's capital should be called a \"Jihad incursion.\"\n\n&gt; Enslavement became most extensive in the region after the Muslim capture of power. [...] In pre-Islamic Southeast Asia, slaves were probably owned by the rulers and high officials, not by common merchants.\n\nFrom a Spanish chronicler describing Philippine animists:\n\n&gt; &gt; These slaves constitute the main capital and wealth of the natives of these islands, since they are both very useful and necessary for the working of their farms. \n\nFrom a 14th-century Chinese traveler who visited Cambodia:\n\n&gt; &gt; Family slaves are all savages purchased to work as servants. Most families have a hundred or more; a few have ten or twenty; only the very poorest have none at all.\n\nMr. Khan's claims are simply false. If anything, Islam was sometimes used against the institution of slavery because Islamic law forbids Muslims from enslaving Muslims.^11\n\n&gt; Animist hill peoples completely disappeared as a result of their incorporation, through enslavement, into the Muslim populace of Malaya, Sumatra and Borneo.\n\nThe existence of [150,000 hill people in Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli) as well as [8 million hill people in Sumatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batak) and [6 million hill people of Borneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayak_people), all of whom were animist in 1800 and many of whom are animist today, must have been fabricated by the secret Muslim conspiracy. \n\n&gt; sufferance of horrible social degradation accorded to infidel subjects by Muslim rulers as per Islamic laws and the burden of onerous discriminatory taxes [...] imparted a coercive compulsion upon them to convert to Islam. \n\nSee [this post for Islamic law in Southeast Asia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5o8avu/how_did_indonesia_and_malaysia_become/dchhdeq/) I personally know of no evidence for discriminatory taxation in Early Modern Islamic Southeast Asia. \n\nThere's a people called the highland Makassars in the Indonesian peninsula of South Sulawesi who were majority non-Muslim until the 1900s. Not only were the highland Makassars not compelled to convert to Islam until the late 1800s, they played an important role in the functioning of Muslim kingdoms - in the late 1700s, one king's legitimacy was challenged by a pretender who argued that the king was illegitimate since highland Makassar leaders hadn't showed up during the coronation. So I'm quite dubious about \"imparted a coercive compulsion upon\" people to convert to Islam. \n\n&gt;  there are far too many modern Muslim historians and their fellow travelers of non-Muslim variety—particularly of the leftist-Marxist leaning—who think that investigating history is not about enumerating and unearthing facts, but about hiding them while writing sophistry.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CexwJ4C.png\n\n---\n\n^1 Lieberman, *Strange Parallels* volume I, ch. 1\n\n^2 For sources, see linked /r/AskHistorians post\n\n^3 For Ava and Pegu, see *History of Myanmar since Ancient Times* by Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin, ch. 5\n\n^4 Hall, *A History of Early Southeast Asia*, p. 236-238; Andaya and Andaya, *A History of Malaysia*, p. 27-31\n\n^5 Andaya, *HM*, p. 57-58; Ooi Keat Gin, \"Borneo in the early modern period,\" p. 90-92\n\n^6 Hall, *HESEA*, p. 280-286\n\n^7 Andaya, *HM*, p. 62-68\n\n^8 Andaya, *The Flaming Womb*, p. 189-196; Creese, *Women of the Kakawin World*, p.229-230; Reid, *Age of Commerce*, vol I, p. 151-158\n\n^9 Lieberman, *SP* vol II, p. 814\n\n^10 M.

Skin care company would pay him so much money, he can drown the Romans in an ocean of cash. \n\n&gt;1:15:34 Fearing the Romans would destroy the city itself, the Carthaginian council is on the brink of surrendering to Scipio.\n\nAgain, much like Hannibal couldn’t understand the Roman concept of war in which the binary outcome is either victory or defeat, the Carthaginian council probably did not understand that either. Were they concern about their city destroyed and their land salted? Probably no. \n\nIn any case, after Scipio defeated the Carthaginians’ last forces in Africa at the Great Plains, the Senate recalled Mago and Hannibal. At the same time, they did what any Hellenistic thinking nation would do, sue for peace. \nScipio’s terms were as following: Carthage would surrender all prisoners and deserters and refugees and evacuate from Italy, and Gaul, and all islands between Italy and Africa. Carthage would surrender Spain, and all of its navy except for 20 ships. Pay an indemnity of 5,000 talents of silver.\nThey accepted. Then Scipio sent a team to Rome to ask the Senate to accept these as well. \n\n&gt;1:15:49 But with the return of Hannibal, they changed their minds.\n\nDuring the time when the Romans decide on the peace term, two transport sail to Africa to resupply the Roman army. They crash-landed on the Island of Aegimurus. \nCarthage was suffering from food shortages, so they sent ships out to collect the supplies. \nIn the mean time, word has returned from the envoys that Rome has agreed to Scipio’s terms. Scipio agreed to let the envoys to go to Carthage but warn that seizing the cargos would violate the truce. \n\nScipio essentially told them, return the cargos, and we will have peace. The senate decline to answer, and someone ambushes the envoy from Scipio. The truce was violated. War resumed. \n\n&gt;1:17:02 Hannibal would fight the Romans on the plain of Zama. He will have a fresh supply of battle elephants. But this time he will face a new kind of Roman army, led by Scipio.\n\nSome additional context is needed to appreciate why BOTH Hannibal and Scipio decide to fight on Zama. We have seen Hannibal only fight battles he chose in Italy, and refuse battle when he does not want to fight. We saw Scipio do that as well. If they both decide to fight here, then there must be a reason why. \n\nFirst Scipio was sacking towns after towns for Carthaginian’s dishonorable actions. Scipio’s military was well trained, veterans from the Spanish theater that this video forgot to address, but for sake of simplicity, these were some of the best fighting forces Rome had. He had receive commitment from Massinissa, a Numidian lord allied to Rome. Massinissa is coming to join him. At the same time, Hannibal was aware of this, and he moves to intercept the Numidian rebels from linking up with Scipio at the same time waiting for his own Numidian, Prince Vermina. Massinissa came with 4,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry, whereas Vermina came with a much larger army, as we know Vermina lost 15,000 men and 1,200 were captured in battle a few days after Zama. \nHannibal is trying to link up with his ally before Scipio, and prevent Scipio from linking up with Massinissa, while Scipio is trying the same thing. If Hannibal does not move, then Vermina would be facing against Scipio and Massinissa alone, and that is true for both Scipio and Hannibal.\n\nAs fate would have it, Vermina was late for a few days. \n\n&gt;1:17:48 He cannot resist the opportunity to meet Scipio who is both his nemesis and in a sense his pupil.\n\nHannibal was well aware of Scipio having achieved asymmetry against his own army. Scipio has outnumbered him in cavalry, as well as having better-trained army. Hannibal probably DID NOT want to fight this, but at this point, in an open plain, it wasn’t like he can just turn around and let the cavalry cut his forces to pieces. \nHannibal fought Zama not because he cannot wait, but rather at that point, he cannot refuse. Scipio had about 30,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry. Hannibal had 40,000 infantry, and perhaps 3,000 cavalry. \n\n&gt;1:28:24 Looks as if Scipio is playing Hannibal, Scipio is playing for time. While they were talking, reinforcement arrived at his camp. The idea of Scipio tricked Hannibal of all the people, tricking the trickster, that’s quite remarkable.\n\nHannibal was probably quite aware of reinforcement. They have camped 5 miles apart. You cannot miss 10,000 men and 5,000 horses on an open plain. \n\n&gt;1:19:08 He even rendered Hannibal’s battle elephants obsolete. When the elephants charged he order his man to split into lanes so they thundered harmlessly by.\n\nFirst I will talk about Scipio’s genius. The Roman military doctrine states that the principes were stationed around 75 meters behind the hastati, thus you can have a clear line of rotation and troops and swap during combat. But Polybius said that these were placed further behind. While the video showed a somewhat proper Roman formation of the checkered board, it was clear that Scipio DID NOT do that.  He arranged the three lines so maniples were placed behind each other, rather than staggered. So it wasn’t like someone blow a whistle, and a new maneuver appeared. That’s how he staged his lines. He didn’t stage them this way in order to dodge the elephants. He staged them in order to maneuver. In that checkered board, it is very hard to have tactical flexibility, where as in columns, thus not in phalanx, you will have flexibility. Thus the first line of Scipio would be hastati boxes with the space between the hestati covered by light skirmishers. \nThen on Hannibal’s elephants. These are fresh animals, though we don’t see any Howdah mentioned in the text. They were also placed in the center rather than the traditional flanks with cavalry. They were used as shock troops, whereas war elephants often carried javelinist and slingers and archers. We can make some educated guess about these elephants, as training them takes around 20 or so years, that these are probably not fully trained. \n\n\nThis video did a horrible job on Zama, but in the interest of media review, I don’t want to discuss something, not in the video, but I do want to point out that Zama was a very, very, very close fight, even if we disregard that Vermina was late. \n\n&gt;1:20:14 Scipio is the only man to ever defeat Hannibal.\n\nGaius Claudius Nero defeated Hannibal near Grumentum and with that, separated the Braca brothers and isolated Hasdrubal. Had Hannibal won that fight, he would have received news from Hasdrubal of his arrival, and they would have linked up, and the war may end differently. \nThere are a few minor fights that probably could have to change the war if Hannibal won. For example, capturing Naples. \n\n&gt;1:20:28 Zama is the beginning of the end for Carthage. \n\nMany considered Carthage’s inability to keep their gains the beginning of the end. They were unable to hold on to Sicily, to Spain, to Sardinia, to Southern Italy. But this expression itself was silly. Carthage could have survived. It wasn’t ‘fated.’ \n\n*MY GOD, DO I have to continue to review this junk?*\n\n&gt;1:21:20 Without an army, Carthage’s only hope is to accept Scipio’s peace term and live to fight another day.\n\nOK, let’s just say for a moment, that you lost everything. Then you need to adapt to survive. Rather than ‘live to fight another day.’ Because you are just going to get everyone killed. Otherwise, why not just go all out? \n\nIn any case, Scipio’s terms were especially generous to consider the war’s length, manpower cost in Italy, and Carthage’s truce breaking habits. Now that Zama was settled, this is something they should have been grateful of. \n\n&gt;1:21:38 Hannibal comes face to face with the politicians who made his war against Rome so difficult, now they want to reject Scipio’s terms.\n\nOh, they readily accepted it. \n\n&gt;1:26:36 Roman Imperialism. \n\nLOL. \n\nOK, this is the end of the review.

        "text": "So I recently stumbled across [this post](http://www.politicalforum.com/political-opinions-beliefs/469842-society-order.html) that could really be posted in any number of /r/badinsertsubjecthere subreddits, but I think the history is the worst part of it so I'm posting it here. (As a side note, this is my first submission to /r/badhistory and I'm not a trained historian, so if I messed something up please feel free to correct me)\n\nThere's so much wrong that I'm going to have to break this down part by part.\n\n&gt; Former Presidnt of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel once said, “Just as the constant increase of entropy is the basic law of the universe, so it is the basic law of life to be ever more highly structured and to struggle against entropy.” Entropy is the propensity of energy to flow from a place of high concentration to where there is less.\n\nSo this isn't bad *history*, but I feel it warrants a mention. From what I understand that isn't a particularly good definition of entropy, but I'm even less of a scientist than I am a historian so I'll refrain from trying to provide a better one and miserably failing.\n\n&gt; This principle can be applied to civilizations as well.\n\nFucking lol\n\n&gt; Consider ancient Rome, the epicenter of culture and safety.\n\n[mfw China apparently sank into the Ocean](http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/images/mlw_0001_0004_0_img0207.jpg)\n\nFor real though, there were plenty of civilizaions that provided \"culture and safety\" to their citizens in the same time period as Rome including, but not limited to: China, Egypt, Greece, the various tribes in Europe, and the civilizations of Mesoamerica.\n\n&gt;At the beginning of its existence its people worked very hard to maintain the civilization they had built, the energy used to establish order came from within. But this arrangement could not stand; human nature led the people of Rome to seek an easier method to maintain their order. They found it in invasion. By taking the “energy” needed to hold civilization together from an outside source they no longer had to provide it.\n\nI literally have no idea what this is supposed to mean. I guess the author is arguing that it was easier for Rome to invade other nations than it was for them to... not invade other nations? I honestly don't understand this at all.\n\n&gt; But according to thermodynamics the total value of entropy, and thus chaos, always increases.\n\nWow, something that's actually right! I'm sure this scientific fact won't be applied to a field totally unrelated to thermodynamics! *sobs*\n\n&gt;  So while order was maintained in Rome, the chaos generated in the lands that were invaded well outweighed it. For instance, in a single invasion the Roman Legion could completely and utterly ruin the lives of 20000 people in the land subject to invasion, leaving them in abject poverty with no law or organization; while the resources and products, or “energy”, that were taken from those lands could only support Roman civilization for 10000 people.\n\n[citation needed]\n\nSeriously, if those numbers weren't pulled straight from the author's ass I'll eat a shoe. Also, I object to the idea that the people conquered by Rome were left \"in abject poverty with no law or organization.\" This is patently false: the territories conquered by Rome were not a lawless wasteland, as evidenced by the fact that many of them were governed by Romans and the recipients of Roman public works projects (such as roads and aqueducts).\n\n&gt; So, all told, the “entropy” of the Earth had a net increase, and always does. Eventually that increase in chaos will always catch up to the order, so no order can last forever, in this case the Roman Empire collapsed under its own size. The transportation of the spoils from victory was not efficient enough to get “energy” from the frontier back to the capitol. That is the fundamental problem, no system is perfect. Because entropy must always increase, efficiency cannot be perfect; and as an empire grows it is always nearing the point at which its own efficiency of maintaining order is not great enough to sustain itself. \n\nWell, I don't think anyone has ever posited entropy as being the fall of the Roman Empire, so I'll give the author that. Aside from that, I don't even know where to begin. I don't know how you can inefficiently move the spoils of war from the frontier to the capital (short of sending them through a very indirect route, which to my knowledge the Romans didn't). It honestly makes it sound like the Romans ate too much food or something, but that might just be me trying to make sense out of something devoid of it.\n\n&gt; This realization begs the question: what is today’s Rome; where is the “energy” flowing to, and from where? This question is simple enough to answer: the West; Europe and the US have been building on the backs of workers and resources found in Asia, Africa, and South America for centuries. During the age of exploration an economic system was established that sought to focus all wealth into the hands of Europeans. Rather than throwing off this system during the revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the residual chaos of the regime changes simply reinforced it. But now it seems the tributary states are wishing for freedom yet again.\n\nI'm not going to comment on this because I'm not super knowledgable about what he's saying and also it's getting late and there's more egregious stuff left that I need to get to.\n\n&gt; China has emerged as a superpower, facing off against established leaders like Russia and the US on a regular basis.\n\nSo apparently China does exist, it just appeared from thin air as a full-fledged superpower sometime in the past couple decades.\n\n&gt; The Middle East has begun to capitalize on its own disorder by turning the anarchy to profit, oil prices rise when war comes to the area.\n\nThis isn't strictly related to bad history, but I'm just imagining ISIS going on a Jihad for higher oil prices.\n\n&gt;  Latin and South America are invading the US through mass migration, much as refugees from the wars in the Middle East flood into Europe.\n\nThis might come into conflict with Rule 2, but the way this is phrased is disingenuous to say the least. It makes it seem like there is a Latin American conspiracy to invade the US through migration, which to my knowledge is not the case. \n\n&gt; The Visigoths didn’t attack Rome while the armies were well fed and well supplied, they attacked after decades of infighting had eroded the ability and will power of the legions and they hit as hard as they could because they knew that they wouldn’t be getting a second chance.\n\nTIL that the Visigoths conquered Rome in one fell swoop, and that there weren't decades of border conflicts that preceded multiple wars between the Visigoths and Romans.\n\n&gt; The “pax romana”, or Roman peace, lasted only two hundred years; the current order has been in place for over three hundred already, how much longer can we really expect to last?\n\nSo within the past 300 years we've seen: the rise and fall of the British Empire, the rise of USA as a global superpower, the rise of Germany (twice!) as a threat to the stability of Europe, the rise and fall of the USSR, and, by the author's own admission, the rise of China as a power on the world stage (and that's just off the top of my head). Nope, no changes to the world order there.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, mostly\n\nMy own knowledge",

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SreYZHAUmlw\n\n\nThe claim is that an ancient papyrus was discovered, which mentions Jesus' wife. This text comes from the same time the cannonincal gospels were written. Cenk goes on to mention the fact the gospel writers didn't actually know Jesus in person (a fact which is granted by many scholars, as far as I know, though some argue against it). He goes on to say the earliest gospel (I presume he means Mark, although he doesn't mention it by name) was written 80 years after Jesus died, the other gospels were written several hundred years after Jesus' death. Many of these texts were rejected by the 'Council of Nicea' and the others were chosen, and these texts are now in the Bible. The text which mentions Jesus' wife was rejected, thus the reason why it doesn't appear in the modern-day NT.\n\nThe claim that the Gospel of Jesus' wife can be dated close to the other gospels (even the gospel of  Thomas or the gospel of Philip) has been proven false. According to a blog by Bart Ehrman, there is no doubt that the gospel of Jesus' wife is a modern day forgery, dating to 1997. [See here for more info](https://ehrmanblog.org/back-to-the-forgery-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/).\n\nThe gospel of Mark was written around 66-70 (Perkins, 1998,The Synoptic Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles: Telling the Christian Story\"). That's about 35-40 years, not 80 (dating the crucifixion to around 30-33). And the gospel of John, generally considered to be the last written, is dated to around 90-110, which is still short of one hundred years - and funny enough, is at latest 80 years after Jesus died - when, according to Cenk, the first gospel was written. \n\nBart Ehrman also has noted that the notion that the Bible was decided at the Council of Nincea is one of the most 'widespread misconceptions'  concerning Early Christian history. (https://ehrmanblog.org/widespread-misconceptions-council-nicea-members/). We are sure of this because we have many of the council's issues and decisions, and this is not reported there. It mostly comes from the DaVinci code.\n\n\nCenk urges people to study biblical history...I am inclined to think he ought to take his own advice ;) \n\n\n",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! I am finding that the number of documentaries I am interested in is starting to decline (mainly because my primary passion is either ancient or eastern wafare), so I am doing something different. I am going to review a movie. This film is called Dragon Blade, and stars Jackie Chan, John Cusack and Adrien Brody:\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3672840/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\n\nThe movie is about a Roman legion that teams up with a Chinese garrison to thwart the efforts of a Roman Consul to control the Silk Road. Yes, it is as bad as it sounds. As with my previous efforts, I shall take a drink of imaginary alcohol when an error appears, but due to the sheer amount of inaccuracy I shall not be addressing every mistake. My faithful bottle of mead is with me, so let us begin.\n\n1.03: Oh Gods, the musical score includes a synthesizer.\n\n1.21: The film is set in 50 BC, and it begins by saying that a Roman legion vanished whilst fighting the Parthians. First of all, the correct term is \"annihilated\", second, it was about eight legions, third, that occured in 53 BC. There were lots of Roman prisoners taken, but these were employed by the Parthians as builders. DRINK!\n\n1.28: The film next states traces of this legion was found along the Silk road in China. The film must be referring to the idea that Romans settled in Liqian, but this theory has been descredited as the residents show no genetic ancestory to Italy. DRINK!\n\n1.48: \"This story is inspired by true events\". BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *inhale* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\n2.27: So we have two cavalry armies ready to fight one another. Apparently no one used missile weapons on the Silk Road because they are standing 50ft away from each other. The weapons and armour look completely ahistorical, but I am not going to drink as I do not know which cultures they are meant to represent.\n\n2.51: A champion from one army races towards the enemy force. In response, one of the opposing riders sends out his falcon to attack the horse of the champion, throwing him to the ground. I think I accidentally purchased one of the Pokemon movies.\n\n3.20: HOMOEROTIC WRESTLING SCENE!\n\n3.27: Jackie Chan and his elite Kung-Fu buddies ride between the two sides.\n\n3.31: So Jackie Chan leads the \"Silk Road Protection Squad\". I am assuming here that Jackie Chan serves the Han Empire. The Han Empire never used a single squad to garrison an area, no matter how many magical martial-arts powers they had. The Han used a mix of standing and conscripted troops (convicts were often sent to the western frontier), and deployed their soldiers in mass formation. There would be at least several companies responding to this skirmish, and it would have been a a composite force of infantry, crossbowmen and cavalrymen. DRINK!\n\n3.36: I have no idea what the hell kind of outfit Jackie Chan has on. This is what he looks like:\n\nhttp://cdn1-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/dragon-blade/db3.jpg\n\nI cannot tell wear the armour starts and the Final Fantasy costume begins. This is what Han cavlary would have appeared as:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/dd/84/79/dd847945e074306e39a84195fc4113fb.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n3.42: Jackie Chan politely asks everyone to stop fighting. This plan is sure to suceed.\n\n4.00: So the army with the falcons are meant to be the Huns. I will accept this as they are basically meant to be the Xiongnu and so the name will be more familiar to Western audiences.\n\n4.11: The mission of the Silk Road Protection Squad is to \"Turn foes into Friends\". Whilst this was often a policy towards the nomadic tribes, there was also the Han mission of \"Turn foes into mountains of bodies if they oppose our conquest\". The Han Empire was very militaristic, and the the film white-washes this in favour of showing the Chinese trying to achieve a state where all peoples live in harmony. ANACHRONISTIC PROPAGANDA DRINK!\n\n5.07: MISOGYNISTIC COMEDY BOOB GRAB!\n\n5.23: The female Xiongnu fighter, Cold Moon, looks like she got lost and wandered off the Lord of the Rings set:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d5/4d/e1/d54de1aa131d1c048a0dbb5e07370540.jpg\n\nAlthough this image depicts Sarmatians in the 1st century BC, it is a good indication of what  equipment was used on the steppes:\n\nhttp://www.horsenomads.info/images/pictures/full/Sarmatians-3.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n5.40: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n5.49: In a martial-arts movie this counts as foreplay.\n\n7.26: Okay, I guess it was foreplay.\n\n7.58: Now we have a massive city in a desolate region with no agriculture or visible sources of water. DRINK!\n\n8.02: Okay, I have to give the film props for showing a Bactrian camel.\n\n8.05: And now we have a public school were children of all races learn together in Glorious Communist Chinese Harmony. ANACHRONISTIC PROPAGANDA DRINK!\n\n9.03: Jackie Chan belives in the equality of all races. Do you hear that, Uighers? STOP TRYING TO SECEDE!\n\n9.31: Those swords are in no way historically accurate. They look more like modern dao, whilst the Han at this time used swords which looked like this:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4f/78/9c/4f789cee13131def9863c682d0fcf5a6.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n9.58: The Chinese infantry wear what is essentially fantasy armour:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/X4uFo\n\nChinese infantry would have looked like this:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e4/86/62/e48662f8d6d21e6973a0b79f2af650e4.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n10.15: More Chinese fantasy swords:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ffgAC\n\n DRINK!\n\n11.36: Another massive city in a desolate region with no agriculture or visible sources of water. DRINK!\n\n13.33: Jackie Chan shouts \"Stop fighting!\" whilst randomly beating people up.\n\n13.57: Man, all these different cultures are so fracticious. It is a good thing the Chinese are there to keep order......wait\n\n14.53: And now the Romans appear. The time means this will not bode well.\n\n15.02: JOHN CUSAK!\n\n15.20: The equipment of the Romans can hurt you just by looking at it:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Ah7Q7\n\nThis is what they would have looked like:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/39/4b/b6/394bb63933de481ea2a94f5ff0a1e76c.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n15.31: The Roman legion includes crossbowmen, a weapon they did not use until about 300 years later. DRINK!\n\n17.21: The standard Roman method of besieging a city is to ride towards  it on horses. Also, FANTASY GLADIUS! DRINK!\n\n18.21: The Legion is called the Black Eagle Core instead of being numbered. DRINK!\n\n18.37: CHINESE FANTASY SWORD! DRINK!\n\n18.43: John Cusak decides the best way to fight is without a shield, whilst using a weapon intended specifically to be employed alongside one. DRINK!\n\n19.16: Roman infantry are just using a spear when their standard panoply would have been javelins, sword and shield. DRINK!\n\n19.31: I will say that the fight scenes are awesome.\n\n19.41: The acting is so bad it is deadlier than the weapons.\n\nAnd that is it for now. The movie is around over 2 hours so each review will be 20 minutes long.\n\n\n\nSources\n\nThe Complete Roman Army, by Adrian Goldsworthy\n\nThe Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han, by Mark Edward Lewis\n\nThe History of the Roman World, by H Scullard\n\nImperial Chinese Armies : 200 BC-589 AD, by CJ Peers \n\nThe Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire, by Lawrence Keppie\n\nThe Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China 221 B.C. to AD 1757, by Thomas Barfield\n\nRome and the Sword: How Warriors and Weapons Shaped Roman History, by Simon James",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5p49g3/revolutions_in_russia_china_and_cuba_were_all/",
        "text": "So  the offending context post [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/5p102z/new_left_faction_that_threatens_to_white_ant_the/dcnrlna/).\n\nI've posted the link as context, simply to follow the conversation more easily. A user named Revoran kicks off the conversation by claiming that basically a revolution generally succeeds when a military or police force decides to either get involved actively, or at the very least sit back and let things happen. This is **not** the badhistory.\n\nFrom there, a user named fetalbarthes decides that the common people, untrained, ill-equipped and in the face of the army, successfully achieved revolution through force of arms by beating the army in Russia, China and Cuba....\n\n**-Recordscratching.mp3-**\n\nWait wut?\n\nLet's assume a couple of things here...\n\n1) By Russian Revolution, we're talking about the October Revolution.\n\n2) By Chinese Revolution, given that fetalbathes is referring to the eventual victor of the Chinese Civil War, we're going to have to extrapolate this (and indeed this extrapolation plays out as he digs himself deeper) to mean not the Revolution of 1911, but the eventual civil war victory and declaration of the PRC in 1949.\n\n3) Cuba doesn't come into it, because it doesn't have to for the Badhistory to occur.\n\n**Exhibit A** courtesy of fetalbarthes\n&gt; Except the times where they fought against them and lost, such as in Russia, China, Cuba, etc...\n\nLet's look at this on a country by country basis...\n\nRussia - The revolution *is basically started* by Russian sailors, marines and the Petrograd garrison. What vocation or social class these men came from before they became part of their nation's military is irrelevant. In the context of the revolution at that time, far from being a civilian uprising against the military, it's the military doing the heavy lifting!\n\nChina - Far from being some victorious force against the state as it stands, the CCP/CPC actually starts as part of the GMD in 1921 (EDIT: Thanks to u/gaiusmariusj - this date is incorrect, better dates would be 1922 or 1923). Given that the revolution to overthrow the Qing came to a successful conclusion in 1912, this reinforces Assumption 2 above. Mr fetalbarthes' argument now rests on the notion that the PLA just rose up as an civilian body and started fighting the GMD's army.\n\nThe problem with this is that there's twenty years of history in the middle, during which the CPC and the PLA end up gaining a ton of paramilitary and military experience fighting against local warlords, GMD forces and the Imperial Japanese Army. More on this later, but this doesn't immediately seem to fit the profile of a bunch of civilians who just decide to take on a standing national military and win.\n\nCuba - All that needs to occur with Cuba for this statement to be refuted is that the situation in Cuba has to be different from that in Russia (Army starting it), to China (Standing Army vs Standing Army). Now I'm no expert on the Cuban Revolution, but it does on surface appear to be more in the nature of an assymetric insurgency - problem is it also appears very different from Russia and China... so that's that generalised statement debunked.\n\nNow, in trying to demonstrate how the different cases were not just different, I make a pretty contentious statement - I claim that the two ideologies favoured by both Russia and China were somewhat incompatible. This might seem a bow drawn too far, but it has a kernel of truth - Russia was based on a Marxist revolution where Industrialisation was seen as an enabler with the proletariat owning that means of production. Mao actually saw Industrialisation in that western context as a means of exploitation, something that would weaken the revolution - as such the Russians saw their power as coming from the urban proles, the Chinese from the Agrarian Peasantry. These two attitudes do not necessarily mix and I pointed out that not only were the Chinese disinterested in the Russian view, they were fiercely independent of any kind of Russian influence... I cited the tensions of the 50s and 1969 border clashes as an example.\n\nBy now we've diverged from the original point, but the sins continue as there's a blind attempt to negate the explanation as to why this whole notion is a bad one...\n\n**Exhibit B**\n&gt; Sorry kid, the majority of the fighters in the case of all 3 of these revolutions were common people with minimal training.\n\n&gt; LOL the pla was literally a peasant army, it was tiny during WW2\nfucken' idiot (sic)\n\nSo the focus now turns to China, because our friend here has no doubt looked on Wikipedia long enough to realise he's out of luck with Russia. Unfortunately, he doesn't realise, a) that defeats the purpose of his argument and b) there are pages on Wikipedia regarding the PLA's involvement in WW2 that he could've looked at as a precursor to moving onto other sources if he was interested in the subject matter. Because if he had looked, he'd have seen that when the PLA was, by mutual agreement, folded into the GMD's NRA as the New Fourth Army and the 8th Route Army. While the former was small, the latter was not - unless we can use a similar metric and conclude that the number of men pulled from Dunkirk was tiny - it was a formation numerbing in six figures! And given the latter basically became the PLA after the war's end, to claim that the PLA was tiny, or inexperienced, or untrained by the end of 1945? Was the PLA just as much so between 1945 and 1949? \n\nNow this is not to say that huge numbers of peasants weren't employed by the PLA from 1946 onwards. But it's ranks were just as full of trained citizen-soldiers from regional cities, GMD deserters and veterans from both sides in the war against Japan. Claiming that the whole Army was basically just a bunch of rambling peasants with no training or experience? Nopenopenope. I've waited for the conversation to die so that he could follow up on a contradictory statement that he later made about receiving training whilst as part of any army or as a result of cadre passing on combat knowledge and experience not counting by deleting the ill thought out assertion that started prompted the Badhistory in the first place.\n\nAs for, again, Russia - I think it's been sufficiently debunked that not everyone in the Russian Army was a bumpkin twat with a pitchfork. Certainly the quality of that army was not great, especially compared to the armies it was fighting during the First World War. But John Erickson's work on the Red Army that I've glanced at doesn't indicate that the Red Army that formed from the Imperial Army was a civilian organisation in any way, let alone one that was untrained, unequipped or otherwise not military capable to greater or lesser extents. And again, these guys started, and were necessary to, the revolution... far from being an organisation that fought the revolutionaries.\n\nThe rest of the post context is mainly just a pissing contest where I suggest he's indulging in Badhistory (and given that he's basically cherrypicked one or two ideologically convenient facts and ran with it, I maintain it's a fair charge), he dares me to make a post, suggests I'll die of shame as a result, and then baits me later while I'm doing other stuff as to why I haven't posted yet.\n\nSo here it is. I call Badhistory. Dying of shame I ain't.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nJohn Erickson , The Soviet High Command: a Military-political History, 1918-1941 (2001)\n\nRonald Suny, The Soviet Experiment (2011)\n\n\"Chen Duxiu\", Encyclopedia Britannica 2009\n\nMichael Lynch, The Chinese Civil War 1945-49 (2010) - this source is pretty broad, so if there's some criticism in this space, I'm happy to wear it.",

I'm not going to argue the US (don't forget the UK!) was doing good in the overthrow of Mossadegh, or even that it blew up in our faces. But there are loads of cringeworthy comments that the US is \"directly\" responsible for the Iranian Revolution and (sometimes even at the same time) arguing that people were so free under the Shah.\n\nTo point one: yes, the US was involved in the coup in 1953, and backed the Shah's regime, which was rather repressive. But to say we directly created the conditions in 1953 for a revolution in the late 1970s ignores 25 years of Iranian agency in their own history. Additionally, while it was eventually won by the Ayatollah and friends, the revolution itself was remarkably broad-based, with secular liberal and socialist groups and people across the society supporting it. It wasn't until after the revolution itself that the Islamists gained the upper hand.\n\nLeading to point 2: while women and many professionals and secular people had _some_ more freedoms under the Shah, politically it was incredibly repressive. The Islamic Republic isn't (and especially wasn't) a democratic utopia, but the nature of the revolution caused there to be a lot more of the trappings of democracy than we might expect given news coverage of Iran since the revolution. Life is messy.\n\nThis is to pointedly ignore all the islamophobia throughout the comments.\n\nBut really what gets me most annoyed is that no one has commented that the woman on the right is dressed like Luigi.",

        "text": "Now let me ask you, or tell you people literally:\n\nWhen it comes to rockin' such pedantry, few are better than me.\n\nOk, playtime's over. Now I'm going to start pointing out some historical issues contained in the song [\"You Must Learn,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYF1xRgqdOM) from Boogie Down Productions' (hereafter BDP) *Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip-Hop* (1989). The purpose—a lofty and necessary one—of the song is essentially to point out the contributions that black individuals have made to various fields of knowledge that get glossed over in the history books. This sort of bias in historical narratives would have been even more pronounced in the late 1980s, but nevertheless remain in today's education. Hence, you still see narratives in primary/secondary education that teach something like \n\n&gt;Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves \n\nas opposed to the more nuanced \n\n&gt;Lincoln, responding to various pressures like the abolitionist lobby (incl. F. Douglass) and the growing question initially imposed on him by slaves fleeing to Union-controlled territories early in the war, gradually adopted increasingly anti-slavery policies that by the end of the war culminated in slavery's abolition via constitutional amendment.\n\nObviously the second one is a far better (yet skeletal) narrative, as it incorporates the contributions made by a far greater number of people—black and white, slave or free—in the realization of radical social change. KRS is arguing for something like the latter, using examples. \n\n---\n\nHowever, the Knowledge presented in this song doesn't exactly Reign Supreme Over Nearly Everyone, because KRS takes considerable liberties with some of them. I'm going to go directly to the problem verses:\n\n&gt;Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor\n\n&gt;No one told you about Benjamin Banneker\n\n&gt;A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac\n\n&gt;Can't you see where KRS is coming at?\n\nYes, I can see where he's coming at, but he is certainly wrong about Banneker's contribution. Banneker, a free black person, surely was influential in early American…*almanaquery?* But, his were published over a period spanning from 1792-1797. To refute the claim that Banneker 'invented' the almanac, I need look no further than what is probably the most famous almanac in American history, Benjamin Franklin's *Poor Richard's Almanack*, published between 1733-1758. Franklin's, of course, wasn't the first even in the British North American colonies—Nathaniel Ames published his almanacs in Massachusetts over a span of about fifty years starting around 1726, and Benjamin 'B-Frankz' Franklin's brother James began publishing his Rhode-Island Almanack two years after Ames', in 1728. None of these, furthermore, was even close to the first noteworthy almanacs in British North America. That title belongs to William Pierce, whose *Almanac for New England for the year 1639* was published at Harvard in…well, 1639. Further still, there are numerous other early-modern English almanacs, which only borrowed on a late medieval tradition of English and German almanacs, several of which predating the Gutenberg press. Even further still, almanaquery in the modern sense can be traced back to Islamic-world scholars in al-Anadlus, with other publications generally considered to be almanacs extend well into antiquity.\n\n&gt;With Eli Whitney, Haile Selassie\n\n&gt;Granville Woods made the walkie-talkie\n\nFirst, I don't know why Whitney is mentioned, as he was a white man whose cotton gin is widely believed to be—while contrary to Whitney's intentions—a crucial factor in the extended viability of slavery into the nineteenth century and the rise of King Cotton.\n\nGranville Woods did not invent the walkie-talkie, that was a WWII-era innovation attributed to Donald Hings. Woods is responsible for a good number of innovations, the most relevant being telegraphony, a system which enabled the transmission of both telegraph and voice signals over a single wire.\n\n&gt;Let me continue with Theodosius\n\n&gt;A Greek ruler not known to most of us\n\nOk, since I began this, I've had company over and have thus dispatched a good amount of port and brandy, so I'll keep this one simple and conclude. My only issue here is with calling Theodosius a 'Greek' ruler, given that he was the last of the *Roman* emperors to oversee both the eastern and western sections of the Empire. Whether raised in the eastern part of the Empire, or reigning over it first, I'd be wary to call him a 'Greek ruler'.\n\nAnd that about does it. May I conclude by saying: *Bo bo bo, clack clack clack clack clack—get your hist'ry knowledge at \\/r/badhist'ry, know that.* Now all I wanna do is listen to some BDP…maybe teach some birds to be a cat. Just ask yourself: [*why is that?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDOJj6LkrY)",

        "text": "https://youtu.be/T3jmhzO8YZE?t=3533\n\n\n&gt;59:00 *Hannibal takes off freshly made bronze rings. *\n\n\nIf these are ancient families, which many of them were, then these rings would probably be a bit more green as these bronze rings stayed in the same family from the early periods of Rome. \n\n\n&gt;59:50 Hannibal’s army has killed 50,000 Romans.\n\n\nHannibal fought 4 Roman consular legions and 4 allied legions. Which means half of these guys are Italians. Varro also saved 10,000 men as the consuls set them aside to guard the baggage train. So there weren’t 50,000 Romans to be killed. \n\n\n&gt;1:00:10 Expert: After Cannae, the Romans can imagine their city been destroyed, defeated and Republic ending.\n\n\nI don’t know what the Romans were imagining, but they certainly didn’t think their city was going to be destroyed, they are probably focusing on the issues at hand, which is raising armies, and defending the home city.\n\n\n&gt;1.00.26 But Hannibal’s army is relatively small design for a quick victory on the battlefield, not for long sieges. \n\n\nHannibal took his armies to multiple sieges, in Spain, in Gaul, in Italy. He has both won and lost sieges. As for his army is relatively small, he had more than enough to put Rome to a siege, as Rome had no more than 17,000 men on hand. \n\n\n &gt;1.00.40 Expert: The problem is manpower. You cannot beige a city unless you outnumber them significantly, usually 3 to 1, that’s the rule of thumb. Hannibal needs more man. \n\n\nHannibal had 3 to 1. A lot of Gauls and Italians (rather limited number of southern Italians) and Greeks were rather interested in joining this Phoenician prince who seems like pure magic. Hannibal’s army between Cannae and 211 was probably between 60,000 and 70,000. Hannibal’s issue wasn’t one of manpower shortage, he had a logistic issue and a very very serious one at that. \n\n&gt;1.01.48 Expert: if they make peace with the Carthaginian their entire confederacy falls apart. That has to be what they thought was at stake.\n\n\nWhere did they find this guy? \nRomans didn’t make peace for 2 simple reasons. They weren’t losing the war that badly, and they had more armies and more manpower. They still have relatively free reign over the northern Latin allies, who didn’t think of abandoning the home city. And the second reason is Rome view war as an ultimate struggle, a fight to the death. There were only two outcomes in the Roman mind, victory, and defeat. The Hellenistic thinking of winning a battle and sue for settlements will be the downfall of Hannibal and the Carthaginians. All Alexander’s fault. \n\n\n&gt;1.05.54 The Republic derived its power and military might from its allied city states.\n\n\nWhat? Rome did not derive anything from anyone other than the back of legionaries and the sword of the legionaries. The allied are allied because they were beaten. Not because Roman power rested on them. \n\n\n&gt;1.02.03 After Cannae, many of these allies in the south defected to Hannibal. If Rome shows any weakness now, more would abandon the republic. \n\n\nContrary to popular belief, Roman arrogance sends many of their Greek and Italian allies to Hannibal. But the Latin confederacy is where the real power lies. \nAnd let’s face it, in realpolitik, you ‘showing’ resolve don’t mean shit. I can show all the resolve I want if I lose a battle of that magnitude, those who will abandon you WILL NOT think twice just because you showed more resolve. Those who stick with you probably will thank you for choosing wisely, then because you are Rome stick with you after the Phoenicians leave. \n\n\n&gt;1.03.42 But the council is afraid of what would happen to Carthage if Hannibal loses. Expert: We almost get a sense of see a see no evil hear no evil government. They are willing to give Hannibal enough rope to go out and fight Rome but they seem to want to have plausible deniability.  ‘Gosh, we don’t know anything about this war.’ That’s this crazy renegade general doing that, what do we have to do with that.\n\nJesus Christ. \n\nOK, let’s go over the expert first. The video and this expert seem to forget at the early video, where they discussed the Roman envoy to Carthage demanding Carthage to surrender this renegade general, the city elders refused. That’s how the war started. If Carthage was willing to go to war for Hannibal, I think this ‘plausible deniability’ ship sailed a long time ago. And they are acting like Hannibal is the ONLY ONE campaigning on Carthage’s behalf. That just baffles me. Is this a single person campaign? \n\nCarthaginians weren’t just chilling on the side and waiting in boredom as they wait for the next dispatch from the great Hannibal. Carthage actually has an overarching plan. Like any nation that isn’t nuts who is going to war. No sane man go to war without wanting something, whether it is land, power, prestige, or wealth, there is an end game. \n\nCarthage has an end game as well, and Hannibal is just part of that plan. \nAs for the council’s actual refusal, Livy said the following. \n\n**After Mago’s request for reinforcement, Hanno asked Mago, ‘First in spite of the fact that Roman power was utterly destroyed at Cannae, has any single member of the Latin confederacy come over to us? Secondly, has any men belonging to the five and thirty tribes of Rome deserted Hannibal?’ Mago replied no to both. Hanno then asked, ‘Have the Romans sent Hannibal any envoys to treat for peace? Indeed, so far as your information goes, has the word ‘peace’ ever been breathed in Rome at all?’ Mago again replied no to both. **\n\n\n**“Very well, then. In the conduct of the war, we have not advanced one inch: the situation is precisely the same as when Hannibal first crossed into Italy.” **\nThat is why the council refused. Because Hannibal’s strategy of bring battles to the Romans and forcing them to submit HAS FAILED. \n\n\n&gt;1.04.07 And by the same token their attitude towards Hannibal was that if you can do it on cheap that’s fine but we got other fish to fry. It’s your baby and your problem.\n\nWell, the elders were correct. This wasn’t a personal war. This is the real business. Carthage’s goal was to take back the Sardinia and Corsica, the Sicily, and the lost trade routes that were surrendered to Rome after the First Punic War. Carthage wasn’t going to hold land in Italy. Carthage doesn’t even hold real land in many of their own territories. \n\nAt the same time, Carthage did try to send reinforcements to Hannibal. In 215 he received a reinforcement. In 205, a reinforcement to Hannibal was blown off course and was intercept by the Romans. In 203 he received another.\nOne issue was that Carthage simply shifted her strategy. Carthage had no land ambition on Italy, thus her effort was regaining her territory, and Hannibal wasn’t doing that. \n\n\n&gt;1.04.36 Hannibal will continue the war against Rome alone.\n\n\nActually, let’s just go over Carthage’s reinforcements during the war.\nIn 215, 12,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, 20 elephants, and 20 talents of silver was sent to Spain. In the same year, 22,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry were sent to Sardinia.\nIn 213, 25,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and 12 elephants to Sicily. \nIn 212, 130 warships and more than 700 transports were sent again to Sicily. The Same year, another force of 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry was sent to Sicily.\nIn 207, 10,000 troops to Spain.\nIn 205, 12,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, and 30 ships to Liguria. \nIn 204, 6,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 8 elephants. And a butt load of cash. Mago raised an army of 10,0000 Ligurian with that cash.\n\n\nWhile we all enjoyed the idea that this is a grudge match between the Barca and the Scipiones, Rome and Carthage was doing the kind of things US &amp; USSR was doing, they were playing chess in the world, and Hannibal was merely a piece. \n\n&gt;1.04.42 His army rampages through roman towns and villages to provoke Rome to war. Hannibal wants to goad them into another battle. But victory against the republic is far from certain.\n\n\nMost ancient civilizations conduct wars through a series supply camps, and a defined zone of control. A series of supply lines connecting the supply camps and the army and the army protect its zone of control so the supply line cannot be intercepted. Most people don’t go deep in enemy territory simply because it cost a lot to feed an army. Rome was roaming in its’ own territories, so resupplying is really easy. Or at least relatively easy. \n\nHannibal on the other hand, is deep in enemy territory, with no real way of reinforcing himself until he was able to gather some allies in the south, so he is rampaging through towns and villages, but he was just feeding his army. \n\n\nYou need around 2 lbs of grains and rations per day per person. You need additional fodders for your baggage animals. More for horses. Hannibal’s Gallic allies kept cattle’s for cheese and meat. So you need more grazing land. 10,000 animals required about 247 acres of land PER DAY. \nSo sure Hannibal was rampaging, but that was because he has to, because to feed 60,000 men he needed 120,000 lb of grains EVERY SINGLE DAY. \n\n&gt;1.05.41 Expert: This kind of bloody-minded stoic refusal to admit defeat, the Romans simply don’t accept they were beaten. \n\nYes…. Because they weren’t. \nAnd I just realize Adrian Goldsworthy is someone that I need to source. LOL. \n\n&gt;1.06.37 Now Scipio still in his 20s is given the command. \n\nBecause no one else wanted the job. \n\n&gt;1.06.56 *Roman troops slashes and hacks. *\n\nNo, the Romans drill in how they fight, block and stab. Block and stab.\n\n&gt;1.07.17 *Roman troops practice hitting each other’s weapon*\n\n In true Hollywood fashion, they aim for weapons, rather than going for the kill.\n\n&gt;1.08.27 Expert: Hannibal, however, wasn’t even offering that tangible. He has come to set people free, to what? Well, he might hesitate. Tyranny, Roman tyranny, they defeated my father, they want to crush Carthage. Frankly, I am not sure where Carthage is, can I just get on with my life, please.\n\n\nThis is garbage. The Latin confederacy was deep in the Roman camps. Indeed, Hannibal’s failure to obstruct Roman control of this territory will bring his end, but Roman tyranny is real. They JUST talked about how some went over to Hannibal. So guess what, whatever Hannibal was offering, they took it. \n\n&gt;1.09.53 First Scipio will destroy Hannibal’s power base in Spain, then he will invade Carthage itself. Hannibal will be forced to return to Africa.\n\nWell at this point, I don’t know if the Romans even thought about ‘invading’ Africa. I mean, Scipio went to Spain because the Romans had a theater over there. After his father and uncle were defeated and killed, the Roman theater collapsed. That’s why no one wanted the job. That’s how the young Scipio got the job. \n\n&gt;1.10.56 *Soldier wore a helmet.\n\nThat looks like a late Roman helmet to me. Like, 400 years later. \n\n&gt;1.12.01 Hannibal is at the gates of Rome. Rome is the epicenter of Hannibal’s loathing, the heart of the republic that threatens to destroy Carthage. The roman reaction to Hannibal finally marching to their city is not what the expect. This time they were ready. Even if Hannibal could take Rome he can’t keep it. Now Hannibal learns fresh legion is marching to meet him. He would have to retreat from the city the roman system is too strong.\n\n\nI think this is about 211, but without a context of ANY KIND.\nIn 212, Rome has sieged the Carthage’s key ally, Capua, Hannibal tried multiple times to relieve it, but he was beaten back. He also had serious supply issues as more 7 legions were operating in that area and he had to think of something else. That something else is to march on Rome. \nIn any case, Hannibal probably went through Samnium per Lucius Coelius Antipater, then turn west above Rome so he approached Rome from the north and undetected. \n\n\nThe Romans were actually surprised. They didn’t expect people to show up north. Especially not on Pandas. And here is Hannibal again, surprising the Romans. \n\n\nHowever, the consuls just enrolled two new legions to complete their army with the urbanae. So bad luck also followed Hannibal. In any case, the Romans weren’t preparing for Hannibal, they were prepared to send legions to the south to contain Hannibal, and Hannibal just happens to run in both the 2 urbanae and the 2 reinforcement. Had he waited a little bit longer, there may only be 2 legions in the city, but alas, Capua couldn’t really wait any longer. \n---------\n** Also. I just remembered now. Hannibal lost 1 eye before Trasimene. This man has 2 eyes. I just noticed this now. **\n\n&gt;1.13.48. In summary, Hannibal was kicking dust in his camp while he was notified he is been recalled. \n\nOK I want to sleep, so Hannibal at this point has pretty much ran out of room to maneuver. In the corner of Italy. Logistic and eventual manpower shortage in his final year in Italy reduce him to kicking dust in his camp, so this wasn’t too incorrect. But did they really not tell him his brothers were dead? Tsk. Tsk.

Though this is a good song, the story line is inaccurate. It says he was \"stolen from Africa\", which implies that he was a victim of the slave trade. The problem is that the slave trade ended officially in 1807, so he would be at least 59 when the regiment was founded and would be past recruitment age. Even If he somehow joined and fought with the regiment, the line \"a dreadlocked Rasta\" contradicts this. Rastafarianism was founded in 1930 at the crowning of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, doing some simple math you will see that he would be more than 123 years old. Even if this man miraculously lived that long, he would be around 78 years past recruitment age of that time. In conclusion this is a good song based off an actual regiment and their struggles as Africans but is historically inaccurate in many ways.

        "text": "[wew lad](http://i.imgur.com/nKfz8xS.png)\n\n&gt;The real Irish were black, Ireland is also known as hibernia which means land of the hebrews\n\n\"Hibernia\" is a Latin rendering of the Greek \"Iouernía\" which derives from the Proto-Celtic \"Iweriu\" which as far as we know means \"fat/abundant land\". \"Land of the Hebrews\" would be something like \"Hebracia\", I think.  Even if Hibernia meant land of the Hebrews, I don't know how that makes the \"real Irish\" black people, seeing as the Hebrews weren't black.\n\n&gt;Black people ruled Europe from 193AD up until the 1600s before slavery in America\n\nWhy 193AD? Presumably referring to the acension of Septimius Severus?\n\nIf black people ruled Europe, and \"black people\" are some sort of monolithic political entity, then why would they send their subjects to Africa to buy slaves?\n\nThere was European slavery in the Americas before the 1600s, as early as 1502, and native forms of slavery long before that.\n\n&gt;Septimius Serverus was one of the first black roman emperors\n\nHis mother was a Roman and his father was of Berber origin, I don't think that makes him black. He was born in Africa, sure, but that doesn't make someone black. \n\nI wonder if 2000 years from now people will have internet arguments about whether or not F. W. de Klerk was black.\n\n&gt;The original kings and queens of europe were black\n\nYou'd think the writers and artists of Europe would've noticed this at some stage.\n\n&gt;The moors conquered spain from other blacks in spain during the 7 century and invented the spanish language\n\nYou don't \"invent\" languages! Well, most of the time. And if the Moors \"invented\" the Spanish language then why does it have more in common with Latin than it does with, say, Tamazight? If you go to Morocco today you'll see people who look pretty similar to the Spanish, so I don't think the Moors were black.\n\n&gt;Anglo saxon means angelic sons of isaac\n\noy\n\n&gt;even schwartzenegger name means black black\n\nIf Delbert Gratz is to be trusted, \"Schwarzenegger\" means \"person from Schwarzenegg\", which can refer to two villages in Switzerland and Austria. \"Schwarzenegg\" means \"black ridge\", maybe referring to the soil.\n\n&gt;Why do you think so many black people have Irish names?\n\nPresumably because of Irish people involved in the slave trade? Also, if the \"real Irish\" were black then why do more white people have Irish names than black people?\n\n&gt;Europe was named after a african queen from crete named europa\n\nEuropa wasn't even real! EDIT: Her father was Phoenician, and neither Crete or Phoenicia are in Africa.\n\n&gt;Iberian is the same word as barbarian\n\n???\n\n&gt;that word mean Hebrew\n\n\"Hebraios\" means Hebrew. \"Barbaros\" means barbarian. Those are different words, and aren't related, and neither has anything to do with \"Iberian\".\n\n&gt;Scotland is also known as Hebrides which means new hebrew land\n\nNobody knows was Hebrides means. It refers to a group of Scottish islands, not Scotland itself. And I'd be willing to bet my entire collection of Scottish antique coins that it doesn't mean \"Hebrew land\". \n\n&gt;KENNETH THE (NIGER) RULED SCOTLAND DURING THE MIDDLE AGES\n\nThey link to Dub mac Maíl Coluim, whose name was Dub, not Kenneth. Cináed mac Duib, (Kenneth, son of Dubh), was nicknamed \"An Donn\", which can mean \"the brown\" (which given that he was a Gael would probably refer to the color of his hair), but more likely means \"the powerful\".\n\n&gt;Brit is a Hebrew word which means covenant\n\nThe modern Hebrew word for covenant is transliterated \"Vrt\", which does sound a little like Brit! Or, alternatively, I've got this crazy theory that Brit is short for British.\n\n&gt;England means angel\n\nIt means \"Land of Angles\". Who wrote this, Pope Gregory I? \n\n&gt;Iber, eber, ebro, ebo, igbo, ibo, barber, etc is the same word which means (hebrew)\n\n\"Iber/Ebro\" is the river after which Iberia was named, nobody knows what it means, Ebo/Igbo/Ibo might mean \"the people\" but certainly doesn't mean Hebrew, a barber is someone who cuts hair and while some barbers might be Hebrews, not all Hebrews are barbers.\n\nThere's a bit more to the comment than what I screencapped but it gets outright genocidal so I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.\n",

        "text": "Hello fellow Volcano Worshipers! Nothing brings in the new year like a moderator update post. In fact, ancient, long-dead civilizations like the Italians based their yearly calendars on posts created by internet forum moderators! In this post we wish to provide a glimpse into the Badhistory Moderator Decision Making Process (BMDMP for short) for dealing with *questionable* posts. Questionable being defined as \"A badhistory post that may be badhistory/wrong, but still follows all the Badhistory Rules\". This has been a small point of contention that flares up around once a month, so I wouldn't mind making things a bit more clear for the future. \n \n#####In short, this post should help clear up the uncommon comment:\n \n&gt; Why the hell is this post on badhistory? This IS badhistory!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nIts relatively simple really!\n\n1. Badhistory Moderators are **NOT** experts in **every** field. While some of us have specific areas of expertise, we as a collective do not cover all the bases. This is a stark difference to Askhistorians, which I am sure has much more manpower, and a completely different subreddit objective. So when you see a post that is, well, Bad-Badhistory, we moderators may not know!\n\n2. Building off this, us moderators are not the arbiters of truth, especially with controversial topics.  We tend to shy away from removing posts because X number of comments are calling it Bad-Badhistory. It is that kind of removal-happy, narrative selecting, attitude that breeds badhistory in the first place! \n \n3. Badhistory Mods look at **both** the post and the comments when evaluating a post for removal. When a post is certainly bad, but has a great rebuttal in the comments, we are inclined to leave it up (And tag it with 'Valued Comment'). Think of it as a naturally grown, organic, badhistory post, that you can eat right in the comments! Now for this to be effective, it requires our readers to be critical and check the comments and flairs of posts. We don't think this is too much to ask for, especially since our subreddit is quality over quantity as of late.\n \n4. Our community is very good at moderating with down/up votes. We believe its our duty as moderators to make sure posts meets our rules, we then let our community decide if this is something they like or not. Overall I have been impressed with the community's ability to set its own standards. \n\n4. This doesn't mean we won't remove a Bad-Badhistory post. It just depends! If you want, report it so we get notified sooner!\n \n##TL;DR:\n \nBadhistory Moderators are slow to remove posts that are 'Bad'-Badhistory because moderators don't know everything, moderators like fostering discussion, and usually there is a good rebuttal, we will continue to flair questionable posts with Valuable Comment.\n \n\n#Extra Stuff\n \n- Badhistory Moderators will continue to remove posts advocating neonazi/alt-right/Vegetable-eating^^^^This ^^^^^One ^^^^^^^is ^^^^^^^^a ^^^^^^^^bad-joke /race-supremacy Positions. We believe all valuable discussion regarding the usefulness of fascism ended May 8th, 1945.\n \n- We are kinda tired of the comment \"Why is this post on the front page of badhistory??? Its garbage! This place stinks now\" on Bad-Badhistory posts. Mainly because 9/10 the post is heavily down-voted, or there is a fantastic rebuttal. Also a downvoted post stays on our front page longer than most because we do not get that much new content. \n \n- We can request you to post sources for your post or comments. Usually we would only do this if there's controversy around your statements. Failure to do so could lead to the post or comment's removal.\n \n- We will most likely remove any questions or discussion based posts. Sometimes we leave some up (if its been a slow week), but the majority of the time they are shot down. Want to make sure your question is answered/seen? Message the moderators first! Or use a Monday/Friday Thread.\n \nWant to discuss? Fire away in the comments! I will probably save this to the wiki for easy linkage in the future.\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5o4sbb/killing_two_racist_memes_with_one_post/",
        "text": "[Racist meme #1](https://poseidonawoke.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/crt6yibwwaedrkz.jpg)\n\nTranscript: Images, mainly of ancient Greco-Roman art with a heavy representation of [Fayum mummy portraits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_mummy_portraits), asserting that \"Romans weren't white\".\n\nR5: This image is fractally wrong, so I'll have to unpack each of the issues at once.\n\n1) Racial classifications have changed over time. [Egyptians, for instance, saw themselves as \"racially\" different from both Syrians and Nubians/Sudanese](http://www.touregypt.net/images/touregypt/race1.jpg). Identifying Romans as \"white\" or \"non-white\" is presentism: questionable history at best. [This PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-12.htm) does a good job of dissecting how racial classifications evolved in the US. With that caveat set aside, let's assume that we're using modern Anglo-American racial classifications here.\n\n2) Rome was not a homogeneous empire. Remember how I mentioned the Egyptians in R5 part 1)? These are Fayum mummy portraits, from Egypt. Even assuming that all the mummies were those of Roman citizens ([not guaranteed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_citizenship#Cives_Romani)), Rome naturalized citizens from various parts of their empire. These therefore might be better proxies for the appearance of Egyptians than for that of Romans as a whole; naturalized Roman citizens from Gaul or Hispania might well look visibly different than naturalized Roman citizens from Fayum.\n\n3) Classifying people into races based on portraits is always tricky, especially considering that humans don't neatly obey racial classifications; [Scandinavians interbred with Khazars](http://tracingthetribe.blogspot.com/2006/10/jewish-vikings-dna-mystery.html), [and there's evidence of medieval Siberian and Arabian intermarriage with the Danes](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/dna-shows-genetic-diversity-find-refutes-scandinavian-racial-purity-myth-a-559284.html). Even setting aside artistic conventions, there are many \"white\" people who fit in among those Fayum mummies with the right hairstyle and costume:\n\n[Ethnic Swede](http://www.movieactors.com/photos-stars/warner-oland-paris14.jpg)\n\n[Ethnic English and Welsh](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/460709099382910976/7E1QZrkT.jpeg)\n\n[Ethnic English with distant Italian and Ethnic Danish](http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Star-Wars-Rogue-One-Jyn-Galen-Erso.jpg)\n\n[Ethnic Swiss from Aargau](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Doris_Leuthard_2011.jpg)\n\n[Ethnic Frisian](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5MjU2NTQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAzODU1Mg@@._V1_UY317_CR12,0,214,317_AL_.jpg)\n\nTL;DR: Having a bit of a tan, curly hair, and/or \"ethnic\" features don't make you nonwhite, and even then making blanket statements about the race of Romans based on portraits from Egypt is pretty crap history.\n\n[Racist meme #2](http://i.imgur.com/bypMvlA.jpg)\n\nTranscript: Population of selected countries by racial classification as well as images of their \"achievements\" to show how outnumbered whites are. \n\nR5: Again, fractal wrongness. I'll focus mainly on things that are relevant for /r/badhistory, but this really is /r/badeverything.\n\n1) The racial classifications don't make sense. \"Mongolian\" (meaning people with East Asian features) is not a valid racial classification, and the vast majority of Indians, Pakistanis, and Iranians do not have \"Mongolian\" facial features (although there are some ethnic groups, often descended from immigrants or living near the borders of those countries, who do in India and Pakistan - [see the Balti Tibetans of Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_people) and the [Tripuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripuri_people) of the Indo-Burmese border).\n\n2) Turks. Are. Not. Arabs. They are Turks, and they speak a Turkic language unrelated to Arabic. [Any good historical outline of Turkey - even that from Wikipedia - will mention the Turks' predominantly non-Arab roots, which include various rounds of Turkic invaders as well as classical Greco-Romans, Thracians, Armenians, and Kurds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Turkey). \n\n3) Compare the list of \"white countries\" with the images of white achievers above them. Leonardo da Vinci is from Italy - Italy is not enumerated on the list. Newton was from the UK - the UK is not enumerated on the list. Microsoft as well as NASA originate in the US - not on the list. The Rubik's Cube was invented by a Hungarian - I don't see any Hungary there. Most of the largest countries where self-identified whites are in the majority - the US, UK, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, Italy - aren't on that list, which only seems to include Nordic countries as well as Canada and Australia. If you're going to define white people as only Nordic, more power to you, but don't you dare go appropriating Leonardo and Newton!\n\nTL;DR: You can't define white people as only Nordic and Anglosphere social democracies when you want to keep their population down compared to the \"Negroid, Arab, and Mongolian hordes\" while then claiming the achievements of historical figures who didn't live in Nordic and Anglosphere social democracies. Rubik, Newton, Gates, and Leonardo are not Schrödinger's whites.",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! Today I am reviewing Ancient Warriors, Episode Eight: The Jannisaries:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjzIDTiruxc&amp;index=8&amp;list=PL6oforB7ir5KG2v6703gKUkAtp6UBRsAz\n\nAs the Jannisaries were employed by the barbaric and evil Ottoman Empire (1453, Never Forget!), I have an imaginary bottle of Raki. So let us begin!\n\n0.43: The narrator states that Constantinople was known as Istanbul for 500 years. Besides the fact that it shall always be Constantinople in my heart, it was always known by a variety of names during the Ottoman period. These included Kostantiniyee in addition to Istanbul. The usage of the Turkish name did not really become widespread until the rule of Secular Freedom-Fighter Ataturk. DRINK!\n\n1.05: The narrator states that Mehmed II besieged Constantinople in 1453 with a 'new army'. There was nothing new about it as it retained the structure and weapons Mehmed II inherited. This included Timar  land-holding cavalry from the provinces, the standing central regiments which included the Jannisaries and were called the Kapu Kulu, irregular Akinci cavalry as well as artillery and naval troops. If the narrator is speaking in terms of technology, swords, spears, axes, crossbows and bows were the most common weapons (as they were throughout Europe). Gunpowder weapons, whilst present, would not start to achieve parity and then dominance until the 16th century. DRINK!\n\n1.12: The narrator describes the Ottoman army as an army of slaves. Slaves were a small proportion of the 15th century Ottoman army and were present only in the central regiments. The rest of the army were paid professionals, troops holding land in return for service or volunteers for specific campaigns. DRINK!\n\n1.42: The narrator says Christian Europe stared into the face of unholy terror in the 15th century. This reeks of portraying the Ottomans as this faceless horde of merciless and irrational conquerers, which is dangerously close to propoganda produced by various Europeans from the time period itself. The Ottomans were perfectly willing to enter into treaties, alliances and trade agreements with European powers. Early Ottoman history also saw the Turks act as suzerains rather than bloodthirsty maniacs, accepting Christian states as vassals who had self-government and supplied troops for Ottoman campaigns. I am certainly not going to go into the other direction and argue that the Ottoman Empire was a progressive utopia of equality, harmony and Marxist hope and dreams (Christians were second-class citizens in legal and ideological terms, after all), but the behaviour of the Ottoman Empire was no different from any other Christian power in the period. Plus the Christians were unleashing unholy terror against Muslim states as well. The Spanish were happily descending on Granada, Muscovy was laying the foundations for the future conquest of Islamic Kazan and Astrakhan and the Knights of Rhodes were imitating sea ghazis quite effectively. In the 15th century everybody played by the same set of rules, so to speak. DRINK!\n\n1.42: Also, the narrator says this whilst a knight using 13th century equipment is depicted in the background. DRINK!\n\n2.08: The narrator called the Ottomans heretics of Islam. As a recall, heretics were those who practiced a divergent interpretation *within* a religion, like the ungodly Protestants. The Ottomans were very orthodox in Islamic terms, so they would be heathens. DRINK!\n\n2.39: Oh boy, here comes the “Jannisaries were unsurpassed warriors” rhetoric. When did this become Deadliest Warrior? Soldiers were a product of their tactical, material and strategic environment. There was no “best warrior of all time”. Except for the Persian Immortals. DRINK!\n\n3.04: The narrator states an Ottoman Sultan spared the lives of Christian prisoners of war, and makes it sound as though they would be slaughtered otherwise. Prisoners of the Ottomans could expect a variety of fates. They could be made galley or household slaves or ransomed back, for example. Apparently 25% of all prisoners became the property of the Sultan in this period, and this counters the view of “Hassan Chop!” that the documentary seems to convey. DRINK!\n\n3.07: “Legend has it that a holy man dubbed them “Yeni Ceri” - The New Troop – destined to spread terror wherever they went”. Once again, Terror the chihuahua is used in warfare.\n\n3.58: The narrator states the Devsirime system began in 1438, but Halil Inalcik states records show it was already in operation in the 14th century. DRINK!\n\n6.14: HOMOEROTIC FIGHTING SCENE!\n\n6.29: The producer of this episode is devoting *way* too much time to this particular scene.\n\n7.14: Documentary uses images of Islamic artwork to depict European crusaders. DRINK!\n\n7.48: And now we have a reference to Count Dracula, who was never named that. His actual name was Vlad, and he was a prince, not a count. And the only time he sparkled was when he was covered in the blood of his impious Ottoman opponents. Dracul was the family name, which was derived from the Latin word for dragon. DRINK!\n\n8.32: “On their left the Turks counter-attacked just as hard”. Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n8.35: What appears to be a 12th century European soldier with a long kite-shield and a conical nasal helm is used to depict fighting in the 15th century. DRINK!\n\n9.16: The crusaders disobeyed the 18th rule of warfare: Never chase after a retreating army of steppe ancestry.\n\n9.42: The narrator says no two Jannisaries carried the same weapon, besides the bow. Meanwhile, here is an image of Jannisaries from the 16th century with the same weapons:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f1/39/3d/f1393df2f57543a0dea33991d79a5430.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n9.50: “From far off his arrows rained down on the crusaders”. Yes, but did they blot out the sun?\n\n10.27: REAPPEARANCE OF 13th CENTURY KNIGHT! DRINK!\n\n13.24: Another reference to the Jannisaries being unstoppable. They could be stopped quite often. John Hunyadi defeated Mehmed II at the Siege of Belgrade in 1456. The Ottomans were also defeated at Vaslui in 1475 and Valea Alba in 1476. All these saw the Jannisaries involved. DRINK!\n\n14.27: The narrator calls Constantinople the last bastion of Christianity in the east. How east are we talking here? Is he forgetting the Georgians and Armenians? DRINK!\n\n15.36: The narrator says the Byzantines placed there trust in a double wall during the illegal conquest of 1453. Constantinople had three walls, although I believe the first wall was very low and so not garrisoned. Still, there were three. DRINK!\n\n16.57: OTTOMAN CANNONS COULD NOT DESTROY ROMAN WALLS! 5/29 WAS AN INSIDE JOB!\n\n22.30: The narrator states the Sultan needed more troops than the Devsirime could supply. Not at all. Timar cavalry formed the bulk of their forces, and there were plenty of volunteers to supply irregular soldiers. DRINK!\n\n23.34: If the Jannisaries were slaughtered in the early 19th century, they could hardly have held dominion for 300 years, since they only really became unruly from the 17th century onwards. So a figure of 200 years is more accurate.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5nphcf/history_hannibal_versus_rome_full_documentary_or/",
        "text": "https://youtu.be/T3jmhzO8YZE?t=2697\n\n\n&gt;45:11 The Carthaginians knows how to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee. The Romans only know how to punch, and they keep on punching over and over again. Thinking somehow they are going to strike a knockout blow, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, they just keep on doing the wrong thing.\n\nActually, had the Gods given some patience to the Romans at Ager Falernus, Hannibal might not get out. But they instead must learn it the hard way.\n\n\n&gt;45:35 His battle elephants are dying, and they were hardly used.\n\nIn Trebia, Hannibal used the elephants as the anchor to his infantry, placing 2 elephant groups at each end of his line. That line stretched 1.5 miles. When the infantry line met, Hannibal's elephant group charged into their opposing infantry position at the end of the line, and his skirmishers peppered them and the Romans fled. \nAfter the battle, the weather killed much of Hannibal’s animals, as he lost almost all his elephants, many of his horses and mules. \nSo they were used in Italy, and many times in Spain and Gaul.\n\n&gt;47:04 despite repeated defeats the Romans pretend to not feel the pain Hannibal inflicts. instead, the senate decides to call up Rome’s largest army in history to put an end to Hannibal once and for all.\n\nWhen Fabius’ term as dictator ended, he turns the military command to Marcus Atilius Regulus and Gneaus Servilius Geminus. The Senate raised a new army for the new consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro. So it wasn’t like Rome suddenly raised 85,000 men, but probably raised 40,000 men with allies and joined the previous army.\n\n&gt;47:35 tens of thousands of roman soldiers had fought Hannibal since he crosses the Alps and no one has come close to beating him.\n\nAger Falernus\n\n&gt;48:35 Hannibal seized a vital roman supply depot at Cannae and block the grain field form the south. Goaded and threatened by hunger the Romans march out to crush him.\n\nWe probably will never know exactly why Hannibal went for Cannae, but Livy did say Hannibal had perhaps 10 days of supplies left, and his Spanish troops were ready to desert him. Atilius Regulus and Servilius Geminus were following Hannibal following the Fabian strategy of shadowing the Carthaginian army, and Paullus and Varro were chasing after Regulus &amp; Geminus. \nCannae was important to Hannibal because he needed the food but it wasn’t exactly vital to the Romans, and Rome wasn’t close to starving without the South. This was the plan from the beginning, at least shadowing Hannibal was the plan. So they weren’t goaded by hunger or taunts, but it was the overall Roman strategy.\n\n&gt;49:22 / Romans marched in 3 men columns and horses rode with them that appears to be miles long. They don’t seem to have any backpack or any supply animals. \n\nSo Romans marched with cavalry as advance scouts followed by the light infantries and skirmishers. Then you probably have the commanding officers and standard bearers and various supply animals pulling artillery pieces. Then you got the legionary marching at 6 men abreast. Followed by the supply train. \nRoman army of 8 legions would require 1600 smiths and craftsman to maintain its equipment. Oxen and mules were required to pull wagons with equipment to repair weapons and armors. This army would require more than 120,000 pounds of grains and rations PER DAY. The mules would require somewhere around 60,000 pounds of fodder per day, and the horses 30,000 pounds. They would need more than 100,000 gallons of water per day. \nBut nope, this video clearly does not think it is necessary to keep food and water on hand. \n\n&gt;50:33 Hannibal is counting on the Romans to make a simple frontal attack. To go ahead without thinking about the danger of exposing their flanks. the Romans rely on the brute force of their legions, legions that are virtually unstoppable once on the move. \n\nWell, we wouldn’t know what Hannibal was thinking about what Varro was thinking. But we know very well Varro was thinking because how he chose to fight this battle. \nWhen Varro arrived, he was camped on the east bank of Aufidius River. Paullus sent some detachment across the Aufidius to establish another fortified camp on the east bank, where the terrain rose steadily from the sea and ridge on the river bank. On the day of July 30th, Varro ordered his forces to cross the river and link up on the east side of the river, denying Hannibal’s plans if he wished to fight in open terrain on the west bank. So here sits Varro, on both his side protected by the river and hills, he can almost forget about flanking cavalry. So no, they weren’t doing it without thinking, they thought it through and pick the thing that is the best for Roman military.\n\n&gt;51:57 Romans march across ridges and into open plains in what appears to be or sq formation with cavalry in the front. You can also see infantry forgetting their various gears on the Carthaginian sides.\n\nAs stated earlier, Varro picked a pretty decent spot, open enough for infantry, but not that open for cavalry. The frontage was probably around a mile. I didn’t exactly count the Roman formations, but that looked a lot more than 1 miles. \nRoman cavalry was at the sides, where Varro commanded the allied cavalry on the left and Paullus commanded Roman cavalry on the right. Skirmishers are the only ones in the front screening the mile long troops.\nThe Libyans usually carried spear and shield and wear linen armor, they captured enough Roman equipment’s after Trasimene that we should probably see far better equipment than this lot. \n\n&gt;53:23 Elite African mercenaries are held in reserve. Hannibal put himself on the front line with his Spaniards and Gauls.  \n\nThese aren’t mercenaries, these were Carthaginians. Did they forget Carthage is in North Africa? As stated in Part I of this series, Hannibal swapped out a decent chunk of his Spanish troops with the African troops just before the war. And these were the guys in the phalanx. \n\n&gt;54:24 Facing full force of Rome’s greatest army Hannibal lead his men forward to meet them.\n\nWell, traditional battles, in which this is one, began with skirmishers do their thing first. No one is leading anyone to get hit by stones and lead balls. \n\n&gt;54:39 He advances his center with his infantry to provoke the Romans to make sure they come in where he wants it. /in the meantime, Carthaginian army looks like a bunch of peasants wearing cloth no helmets and uses spears some of them uses tiny swords, others use like a kopis type weapon. Romans and Carthaginians fought in confused melee like the battle of bastards.\n\nVarro didn’t need any baiting. His intention from the very beginning was to STRIKE IN THE CENTER with his troops. In any case, it was said that when the Roman line advanced, Hannibal unleashed his cavalries as well.\nHasdrubal commanded the Spanish and Gallic cavalry, numbered more than 6000, facing the Roman right of Roman cavalry of 2400, Maharbal commanded the Numidian numbered between 3-4000 facing the Roman left of allied cavalry of more than 3,000. \nVarro’s idea is since they occupied the far most place horses can travel (further more you hit river or hills) so while the Romans were outnumbered, they forced Carthaginian horses to charge through them, rather than out flank them. And since the Romans were so much stronger, all they need to do is survived the cavalry attack, and the infantry will determine the outcome. As for why can’t the Carthaginians divert some resources to attack infantry, I will explain at the end. \n\n&gt;55:47 so they pushed on, but in doing so they lost what little order they had.\n\nThe Romans didn't lose order as they push into Hannibal's lines, they lost order when Hasdrubal wheeled in.\n\n&gt;56:21 his cavalry route the roman horseman and chase them from the field. \n\nThis is the master of understatements. \nThe cavalry engagements were fierce, and Varro overestimated his horses. In a close hand to hand, the Spanish and the Gallic broke through and destroyed the Roman cavalry. On the other hand, Numidians weren’t exactly ‘charging,’ and more of a wheel around and take a few shots. The allied cavalry didn’t budge, as they only need to hold their position. Varro at least held his position quite firm until the Spanish joined. \nAfter defeating the Roman cavalry, Hasdrubal rode pass the Roman infantry that is now engaging the Carthaginian lines and wheeled into the allied troops from the left. Varro was unable to prevent the horses from fleeing the field. Thus Hasdrubal now can reform, and prepare to complete perhaps the greatest artwork in military history.\n\n&gt;57:29 lots of empty spaces with lots of people swinging their arm Hollywood style. Roman soldiers chopping motions.\n\nYou can't say Romans were in a pack formation and were getting slaughtered, and then show us with lots of swinging and chopping. In fact, while the Gauls and Spanish light infantry attack in loose formation, Gauls do charge in shield formations. \nAt the same time, Romans were fighting even after all hope were in rather organize fashions. So while the maniples were broken when Hasdrubal struck, the Romans put up enough resistance that Hannibal’s own army suffered more than 11% losses. \n\n&gt;58:00 Hannibal killed someone with a straight edge sword.\n\nWe will never know what exactly Hannibal used, but it is very likely to use the falcate, or some variety of it with a major focus on chopping. \n\nSo one reason why cavalry doesn’t usually engage in infantry battle unless it’s  flanking motion is because of after Alexander’s death, and during the Successor, Hellenistic armies use good quality phalanx that cavalry would find it impossible to penetrate, thus most armies of that era that are influenced by Hellenistic warfare including Rome and Carthage would use cavalry in the minor role to drive off opponent cavalry and then take advantage of the asymmetry now they enjoy. However, before driving off opponent’s cavalry, one cannot charge the infantry and survive, thus most battles become 2 separate theater between cavalry and infantry. Most cavalry of the days won’t be able to go into infantry because of their choice of weapon. I talked a little about the Spanish jinetes in Part I, so I will talk a little about the Gallic and Numidian. \n\nThe nobilities formed the Gallic cavalry, so they are heavily armored, wearing chainmail and helmets, they use thrusting spears and swords. They fight in the traditional cavalry manners, so unlike the Spanish, they can’t exactly go into infantry in formation. They rarely fight against heavily armored opponents, as their preferred tactics are usually raiding, hit and runs, and they usually perform reconnaissance. Hannibal would sometimes use them to hit the enemy center to make maneuvering rooms for others, but that would often come in heavy causality. \nThe Numidians wore no armors, use no weapons other than javelins, and do not use bit and bridle. Their protection is a small hide shield, and their speed. They are often unable to break off enemy cavalry on their own, much less infantry. \n\n\n\n\nSources:\nPolybius, The Histories\nShean, Hannibal's Mules\nLivy, War with Hannibal\nLazenby, Hannibal's War\nLancel, Carthage\nGabriel, Hannibal, the Military Biography of Rome's Greatest Enemy\nLinton, Hannibal Barca The Greatest General, the meteoric rise, defeat, and destruction of Rome's fiercest rival.",

The Soviet Union made great strides in making homelessness basically nonexistent. This included the widespread and efficient construction of housing facilities and the renovation of facilities that were abandoned decades earlier. As a result, there were very few, if any, homeless.**\n\n&gt;**The only time homeless were sentenced to the camps is if they were intentionally making themselves homeless due to anti-social tendencies. The myth about all homeless being shuttled into labor camps is a piece of Capitalist propaganda.**\n\nLet's go through these claims one by one.\n\n&gt;in the Soviet Union, homelessness was sometimes punishable through 2 years of labor, but it was rare that this would be the first resort.\n\nHe got the 2 years of hard labor part right, but the practice of rounding up the homeless to labor camps was a very common, especially after World War II. The USSR did not make much effort to hide this fact and it is very well documented. Not to mention, even when their 2 year sentence is over, they were pretty much put back on the street since the reason why they were homeless had not changed. As a result, the homeless would often back and forth between homelessness and hard labor. Loads of them turned to illegal methods of evading this by becoming criminals.\n\n&gt;The Soviet Union made great strides in making homelessness basically nonexistent. \n\nHomelessness, while official government statistics often downplayed the actual numbers for the sake of saving face, was a constant problem in the USSR. Especially in the years before and after World War II due to the Stalin era's focus on industrial concerns as opposed to housing concerns as well as destruction during the war destroying countless people's homes. Substance abuse, family situations, and the death of parents also contributed to this issue, but we'll get to that later.\n\n&gt;This included the widespread and efficient construction of housing facilities and the renovation of facilities that were abandoned decades earlier.\n\nThis is actually half true, during the Khrushchev era a solution to housing problems was to build rebar-concrete structures. However, I wouldn't call it really that widespread, maybe efficient. You have to remember the Soviet Union was very vast and varied geographically and economically, some areas were neglected.\n\nFurthermore, the structures were far from perfect, they were known to be cramped to live in. This problem was worsened by the number of people that ended up living inside them. These same structures also had issues with maintenance and numerous fell into disrepair. \n\n&gt;The only time homeless were sentenced to the camps is if they were intentionally making themselves homeless due to anti-social tendencies.\n\nAgain, this is half true, but it's far from the whole truth. A lot of the homeless Soviets were teenagers who were orphans, runaways, or delinquents. The majority of them were victims of their circumstances at home. Many of these orphans lost a father in World War II, but even more lost one or both parents due to Stalin's purges. Orphanages and group homes were notoriously underfunded and were insufficient to handling these problems. \n\nA good portion of homeless people were also alcoholics. Alcoholism was a big problem in the USSR that was not handled well, to say the least. Often times they were alienated by their communities along with their workplaces, which led them to become vagrants. Alcoholism also contributed to runaways since parents who drink heavily tend to abuse and/or neglect their children. \n\nSo, while these people could technically be considered anti-social, they weren't really just loners who didn't want to participate in society. \n\n&gt;The myth about all homeless being shuttled into labor camps is a piece of Capitalist propaganda.\n\nAs I mentioned before, this is not a fringe theory created by rabid McCarthyist rabble rousers. There has been much research into the topic of poverty and social problems within the Soviet Union, it is well documented and it was a fairly well known issue while it was happening. \n\n#Sources\n\n&gt;Helsinki Watch (Organization : U.S.), Robert Kushen, Herman Schwartz, and Abner J.

You don't have to come from Bumfuck nowhere like Stalin did to have your revolution be considered a ~~Marxist~~ **socialist** revolution. You just have to institute actual ~~Marxist~~ **socialist** reforms, which is exactly what happened in France. And the Revolution from the very beginning was run by commoners, not the \"upper crust.\" Have you ever heard of the storming of the Bastille? The womens' march on Versailles? The reign of terror?\n\n&gt;The inability to afford food by the peasantry, and regressive tax laws that heavily taxed the peasants and middle class but gave breaks to the clergy and nobility were both major causes of the French Revolution. After the Revolution, socialist laws like limits on the price of bread, dechristianization of society, universal male suffrage and the abolishment of Feudalism were passed, and then this totally unknown artillery officer from Corsica took control. Maybe you've heard of him.\n\nThe French revolution was an interesting case, as the historiography of the revolution has undergone a number of shifts and challenges. The classic interpretation, also known as the Marxist interpretation is espoused by many scholars, but was most succinctly summed up by Albert Soboul who declared the French Revolution to be the \"classic model of a bourgeois revolution.\" What does this mean? \n\nIn traditional Marxist theory history is driven by conflicts between classes, the major classes being the propertied classes and the working classes. The theory is a mostly economic theory, detailing who owned the means of production and how they controlled them. For Marx (in the Communist Manifesto), feudal society \"industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds.\" However, with the discovery of the Americas, this no longer sufficed for for \"the growing wants of new markets\" and for the newly established \"world market.\" Marx discussed how the \"the bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.\" Basically, for Marx the bourgeois emerged as a class from changes to society that Feudalism could not cope with, and set about a series of revolutions that advanced their political interests and changed the means of production.\n\nFor Soboul, the French revolution was driven by two classes; the bourgeois and the sans-coulettes. George E Rude built on this, seeing the revolution as both a popular movement, motivated by poor harvests and a crisis in the textile industry, merging with a bourgeois movement motivated by the economic privileges, and the over-representation in the States-general of the nobles. Both of these interpretations, therefore, acknowledge that the revolution was a popular movement, however, the movement merged with the interests of the bourgeoisie, Rude even went so far as to claim that the French Revolution shows that popular movements require the support of the bourgeoisie to be effective.\n\nAlfred Cobban took up the task of challenging the classical interpretation in his book *The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution*, which, he claimed, would have \"been written to no purpose, if it [did] not suggest that the repetition of such meaningless clichés is no substitute for historical research.\" Cobban saw the definitions of class used in the traditional interpretation as, at best, poorly-defined “broad generalisations.” He also found the discussions of social movement to be lacking, being too focused on entire classes “rising.” 5 As such, he asked four questions about the revolution;\n\n&gt;“What are the facts of the so-called bourgeois revolution, and in particular who were the bourgeois? What was the feudalism which they were supposed to have overthrown? How was the bourgeois revolution related to the revolt of the peasantry? This raises the problem of town and country. Again, what part was played in the revolutionary situation by the lower social elements? This broadly raises the question of rich and poor.”\n\nCobban first attempts to answer the second question, what is feudalism? He amounts the attack on feudalism to an attack on seigniorial rights, however, the seigniorial rights which existed at the time of the French revolution, and which the revolutionaries expressed distaste for, were not actually feudal in Cobban’s account. Instead they are a significantly commercialized institution which the urban bourgeois, as landowners, profited from as much, as the nobles. For Cobban the attack on seigniorial rights actually came from the peasants and was an attack on capitalism, rather than feudalism.\n\nAnother historian who challenged the classic interpretation was François Furet. For Furet it was the land rents, not seigniorial rights, which motivated the popular revolution. Soboul characterised these land rights as feudal, but Furet shows them to be actually capitalist. If these ‘last remnants of feudalism’ were actually capitalist, then how can the revolution be viewed as a bourgeois revolution against feudalism? Furet perceives this problem as arising from the view of the revolution as a break between old and new, with the old being defined as ‘feudal,’ regardless of the actual economic or political nature of the old. In fact, for Furet, the peasant revolution was a revolution against the bourgeois, not the nobles and any dissatisfaction with the aristocracy stemming from political not economic causes.\n\nFuret what motivated the revolution amongst the middle classes was a lack of social mobility, however, this was not something which just the bourgeois took issue with, instead it was “an amalgamated elite” of nobles as well as bourgeois; a class of people who had grown in both numbers and prosperity, without seeing a matching “widening of social channels.”\n\nCobban also perceived the revolutionary bourgeois differently to the traditionalists. Instead of being the propertied classes it was the proprietors of venal offices, whose fortunes had been declining in the eighteenth century, who comprised the revolutionary bourgeois. \n\nEven more traditional, Marxist historians of the French revolution criticised the view that it lead to the creation of a bourgeois, capitalist state. De Tocqueville, for instance, despite holding a broadly Marxist interpretation of the revolution, saw the revolution as a growth of state power over all classes, as opposed to a growth of bourgeois power over the state. This is part of the shift caused by the new interpretations of the French revolution in which the revolution is not to be seen as the result of social conflict, but rather as the result of political conflict. That is to say, it is not an event where one demographic, or social class, gained power over another, rather, it represented the creation of a new political climate. This new institution of political culture came to be seen as the growth of a new elite, the mixture of nobles and bourgeois which Furet saw as driving the revolution, whose identity was based on land ownership.\n\nFor Cobban the consequences of the revolution was not the establishment of Capitalism, in fact, quite the opposite. The revolution retarded the growth of capitalism. Cobban notes that it was not until 1825 that the French economy reached the level it had been in 1788, due in part to the revolutionary wars. Moreover, the there was a decline in several French industries, leading Cobban to see the revolution as “a step backwards” from capitalism. It was not the men of business who profited, but the venal office holders, lawyers, doctors and other members of the liberal professions who gained the most from the revolution.\n\nSo, what does this have to do with the original post? Well, it should be clear, that even under significant historical revision, not a single historian has seen the French revolution as a socialist revolution. A socialist revolution is, by definition, a revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeois. Even those who saw the revolution as one which slowed capitalism's growth, do not believe that this meant that it was a socialist revolution. Rather, they think that it shows that the French revolution under close examination is indicative of the failures of Marxist historical analysis. This is clearest in Furet, who called his work on the revolution the “catechism of the French revolution” and referred to followers of the classic interpretation as “disciples.”\n\nThe original post does actually almost approach an interesting point about the historiography of the French Revolution:\n\n&gt;you don't have to come from Bumfuck nowhere like Stalin did to have your revolution be considered a ~~Marxist~~ **socialist** revolution. You just have to institute actual ~~Marxist~~ **socialist** reforms, which is exactly what happened in France.\n\nFirst of all, socialist reforms did not occur in France after the Revolution. The means of production remained in the hands of the bourgeoisie, and were not transferred to the proletarian classes. However, Cobban was adamant in arguing that calling the French Revolution a bourgeois revolution required regarding the “the contemporary social vocabulary at face value” which he called mere “narrative” history, and what he sought was “analytic history, which subjects [the contemporary social vocabulary] to critical treatment.” In other words, if we are to examine the large scale social change then we must examine what changes actually occurred, not merely what changes are thought to have occurred. Unfortunately for OP, however, the changes which actually occurred were not socialist in nature. \n\nSources: \n\nCobban, Alfred *The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution.*\n\nCobban, Alfred “A Reply to the Orthodox Critique” in *The Social Origins of the French Revolution: The Debate on the Role of the Middle Classes* ed.

        "text": "In another thread, /u/mictlantecuhtli linked [this article](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27111) by Jared Diamond. It got my blood boiling so I decided to make another thread about it. \n\nI can't decide if this article is better material for /r/badhistory or /r/iamverysmart. He opens by pedantically explaining that complex scientific theories and mathematical proofs, when based on illogical assumptions, can appear legitimate. Before pursuing a line of investigation, we should ask whether the theory we're using matches common sense, and if it doesn't we can reject it out of hand. \n\n&gt;You’re much more likely to hear “common sense” invoked as a concept at a cocktail party than at a scientific discussion. In fact, common sense should be invoked more often in scientific discussions, where it is sometimes deficient and scorned. Scientists may string out a detailed argument that reaches an implausible conclusion contradicting common sense. But many other scientists nevertheless accept the implausible conclusion, because they get caught up in the details of the argument.\n\nYeah, you know, except for all of those scientific theories which *do* violate \"common sense\" but are nevertheless true (or at least useful in explaining phenomena). I understand his point, but science doesn't rest on \"common sense,\" it rests on evidence collected through observation and experimentation. \n\nWhere's he going with this? Well, about halfway through the article he tells us.\n\n&gt;The first well-attested settlement of the Americas south of the Canada/U.S. border occurred around 13,000 years ago as the ice sheets were melting. \n\nOh no. Oh please no. Just don't.\n\n&gt;That settlement is attested by the sudden appearance of stone tools of the radiocarbon-dated Clovis culture, named after the town of Clovis, New Mexico, where the tools and their significance were first recognized. Clovis tools have now been found over all of the lower 48 U.S. states, south into Mexico. That sudden appearance of a culture abundantly filling up the entire landscape is what one expects and observes whenever humans first colonize fertile empty lands.\n\nOh for fucks sake.\n\nFor those of you not \"in the know\" on Clovis and the controversy surrounding it, lets review Paleoindian Archaeology 101. \n\nThe current academic consensus, based on both genetic and archaeological evidence, is that the ancestors of American Indians entered the Americas by way of Beringia (a land mass located where the Bering Strait is today) prior to the end of the last Ice Age. There are a few other proposed origins for migrations, but they are mostly discredited. There were a minimum of three migration events as evidenced by DNA (Schurr 2004). The latter two migrations which took place just prior to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum were largely ancestral to the native peoples of Canada, Greenland, and Alaska, while the first migration peopled the entire hemisphere. \n\nThe dating of the first migration is the source of controversy. In the early 20th century, archaeologists uncovered evidence of a material culture (that is, a set of tools and artifacts of a similar style) widespread across North America dating to the very end of the ice age. The culture appears to have made a substantial portion of their living hunting big game, including mammoth. The culture was named after the site where it was first identified, Clovis, NM.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, archaeologists operated under the assumption that Clovis represented the original migration of peoples to the Americas. It was the oldest known culture and many of its features were exactly what you would expect of the first peopling of the Americas. An elaborate model was constructed around this where people crossed the glaciers between Beringia and the rest of North America via an ice-free corridor that opened between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets during a brief inter-glacial period.\n\nContinuing from Diamond:\n\n&gt;But any claim by an archaeologist to have discovered “the first X” is taken as a challenge by other archaeologists to discover an earlier X. In this case, archaeologists feel challenged to discover pre-Clovis sites, i.e. sites with different stone tools and dating to before 13,000 years ago.\n\nIndeed, from the outset many archaeologists were skeptical of the Clovis First hypothesis. The widespread distribution of Clovis tools across North America seems to show a massive explosion of population, and many questioned whether or not there were already people living in these areas that simply adopted Clovis technology. Yet whenever archaeologists found supposedly pre-Clovis sites, the academic consensus centered around Clovis First would do anything they could to discredit or dismiss the evidence.\n\n&gt;Every year nowadays, new claims of pre-Clovis sites in the U.S. and South America are advanced, and subjected to detailed scrutiny. Eventually, it turns out that most of those claims are invalidated ... the radiocarbon sample was contaminated with older carbon, or the radiocarbon-dated material really wasn’t associated with the stone tools.\n\nIt's not so much that these sites are invalidated. It's just that the standard of proof for pre-Clovis occupation is much higher than other occupations because of its significance. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Archaeologists (rightly) placed these sites under a higher degree of scrutiny because accepting them meant overturning a well-established paradigm. The majority of the supposedly pre-Clovis sites proposed in the mid to late 20th century did not pass this scrutiny. While the evidence presented may not have been controversial in another time period, to definitively prove pre-Clovis occupation of the Americas the evidence needed to be rock solid. \n\n&gt;But, even after complicated analyses and objections and rebuttals, a few pre-Clovis claims have not yet been invalidated. At present, the most widely discussed such claims are for Chile’s Monte Verde site, Pennsylvania’s Meadowcroft site, and one site each in Texas and in Oregon. As a result, the majority of American archaeologists currently believes in the validity of pre-Clovis settlement.\n\nIndeed, towards the end of the 20th century, a few sites did begin to pass scrutiny. The most famous of these, which really dealt the deathblow to the Clovis First hypothesis was Monte Verde, Chile (Dillehay and Ocampo 2015). In time, others began to pass muster as well such as the Buttermilk Creek site in Texas (Pringle 2011).\n\nThe Monte Verde site is significant for three reasons. First, it is located in South America far away from the origin of migration in modern-day Alaska. Second, it has *exceptionally* good preservation (it is located in a peat bog, so actual organic artifacts preserve that can be dated directly). Third, it predates Clovis by a minimum of 2,000 years, and recent radiocarbon dates push the date back to 18,500 years before present, 5,000 or so years before Clovis (Dillehay and Ocampo 2015). \n\nWhen Dillehay began working at Monte Verde and first determined the age of the site as pre-Clovis, the archaeological community immediately challenged the results. In response, Dillehay had a collection of his academic critics flown from the United States to Chile to investigate the site themselves. They did so, and concluded that the site was genuine and predated the Clovis culture. This was in the late 1970s, and by the 1990s as more pre-Clovis sites began to emerge with good evidence the academic wind was shifting towards a rejection of the Clovis first hypothesis.\n\nThis was further reinforced in the 1990s with the discovery that the migration route proposed by the Clovis First hypothesis was not actually available. Advocates of the Clovis First hypothesis had proposed people crossed into the modern-day united states via an ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Turns out, that ice free corridor may never have existed in the first place (Burns 1996, but this is still debated, see Schurr 2004).\n\nThe collapse of the Clovis First hypothesis called into question other theories that were based on it. For example, the Overkill hypothesis for the extinction of megafauna had proposed that it was the introduction of humans to North America which resulted in the extinction of most large mammals. Yet if Clovis First was wrong, then humans had been living in the Americas for thousands of years *before* the megafauna went extinct. This doesn't rule out the possibility that humans contributed to it, but their entrance into the continent cannot be an explanation.\n\nAnd this is where Diamond has a bone to pick. See, Diamond wrote Guns, Germs, and Steel in 1997. At this time, the debate over Clovis First vs. pre-Clovis was still raging. Most academics were beginning to come around towards the pre-Clovis model but there were still diehards that were clinging to the old theory. A huge chunk of Diamond's argument in GGS is predicated on the Overkill hypothesis, and thus by transitive property the Clovis first model. In his book, he argues that the pre-Clovis sites aren't reliable and that even if some of them are true, humans did not exist in substantial numbers in the Americas prior to Clovis. At the time (1997), that was a very controversial statement, but not outside the realm of academic discourse. But 20 years later (2017) it most certainly is. At this point evidence of pre-Clovis settlement in the Americas is no longer controversial, and you would be hard pressed to find any archaeologist still clinging to the Clovis First model.\n\nTo this, Diamond says:\n\n&gt;To me, it seems instead that pre-Clovis believers have fallen into the archaeological equivalent of Mr. Bridgess’s fallacy. It’s absurd to suppose that the first human settlers south of the Canada/U.S. border could have been airlifted by non-stop flights to Chile, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Texas, leaving no unequivocal signs of their presence at intermediate sites. \n\nWho said anything about airlifts? The distribution of pre-Clovis sites along coastlines is actually very consistent with a coastal migration route. Small shore-hugging boats could have allowed a rapid migration of both North and South America along the coast lines, with more gradual settlement moving inland towards the interior.\n\n&gt;If there really had been pre-Clovis settlement, we would already know it and would no longer be arguing about it. \n\nWe do already know about it. And we're no longer arguing about it. You're the only one still arguing here.\n\n&gt;That’s because there would now be hundreds of undisputed pre-Clovis sites distributed everywhere from the Canada/U.S. border south to Chile.\n\nNo, not necessarily. If the earliest settlers had followed a coastal migration route, then most of the evidence of their passage would have been flooded when sea levels rose following the end of the Ice Age. Furthermore, even if this isn't the case archaeological sites tend to not preserve over very long stretches of time. Clovis is really visible because of the large projectile points they used for hunting which tend to preserve really well. If earlier cultures had relied more on fishing or hunting of small game then the archaeological evidence of their activities would be much more scarce. \n\nSo yeah. Sorry Jared. \"Common sense\" may be something we should be reminded of, but it doesn't trump actual empirical evidence. Your argument is basically that your \"common sense\" trumps decades of research, mountains of hard evidence, and a prevailing consensus among experts in the field. Your \"common sense\" is wrong.\n\nSources:\n\n* Burns, James A. \"Vertibrate Paleontology and  the alleged ice-free corridor: The meat of the matter.\" *Quarternary International* 32. pp. 107-112.\n\n* Dillehay, Tom D., and Carlos Ocampo. 2015. \"New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile\". *PLOS ONE.* 10\n\n* Pringle, Heather. 2011.

I recommend watching some of the early ones as they are pretty interesting, but (imo) while the production quality has increased, the quality of the content has decreased and most videos are now pretty touristy and shallow.\n\nAnyway, in the video on El Salvador, at 5:40, Barby (the host) starts talking about the Nawat (which he calls Pipil), and describes them as such:\n\n&gt; Let me tell you something about the Pipil. When the Mayans and the Tlaxcalans in Mexico and Guatemala thought the Spaniards were gods, the Pipil were like \"nope!\" and kicked the Spaniards out of their then-called nation of Cuzcatlan *twice*.\n\n\nSo part by part. First of all, the Mayans and Tlaxcalans, as I imagine you are very well aware, did not believe that the Spaniards were gods. The Nahuatl speaking Aztecs and Tlaxcalans used the term Teotl to refer to the Spaniards, this term is assumed to mean \"god\", or \"gods\", but historians now believe that this may have been a more nebulous term, meaning something closer to \"demons\", or \"mysterious\". Mesoamerican people were open to the idea that the Spaniards might not be made of the same stuff as they, but they certainly don't seem to have thought of them as gods.\n\n\nThis bit of information is highlighted by showing an image of mesoamerican people giving offerings to a conquistador, so as to perpetuate the myth that they didn't put up a fight. This is also very misleading, as we have lots of evidence that mesoamerican peoples distrusted and fought the Spaniards. For example, the Tlaxcalans fought the Spaniards several times, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo himself wrote about it, commenting that despite attempts by their native allies to make them sound as immortal demons, the Tlaxcalans knew that they were \"men of bone and flesh, [that] ate chickens and dogs and bread and fruit\".\n\nThe way that he mentions the Nawat chasing the Spaniards out of Cuzcatlan suggests that they were the only ones to do that, but the Americas are full of states that chased out the Spaniards, a major example being the Aztec Empire itself, which killed most of the conquistadors staying in the city during La Noche Triste.\n\n----------------\n\nAs an aside, he then goes on to say:\n\n&gt; Seriously, they stole the guns from the Spaniards.\n\nThis is not something impressive, taking your enemies' weapons is a pretty basic tactic in warfare, and indigenous peoples the world over did it.\n\n--------------------\n\n**Sources:**\n\nHistoria verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España by Bernal Diaz\n\n\n------------------------\n\nEDIT: Forgot to put link to vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t5uzY77zwA",

        "text": "https://youtu.be/T3jmhzO8YZE?t=992\n\nI think I will split the segments, not in the minutes distributed by the video, but actual phases of the war. This is the planning &amp; the crossing stage. \n\n&gt;16:43 In Rome, Scipio and the senate grow increasing alarm by a report of army been mustered in Spain by Hannibal. They decide to demonstrate the power of Rome by forming an alliance with a Spanish city in Hannibal’s territory. The city of Seguntum…Rome has provoked the wrong man, at the wrong time. Hannibal ordered his army to surround Seguntum. Stun by Hannibal’s nerve, Rome send an envoy to Spain giving him a last chance to back down. \n\nWe know that as early as 225, when Hasdrubal was still alive, Seguntum already establishes a relationship with Rome. They were the reason, along with Masallia, led to Rome treat with Hasdrubal to determine Ebro as the boundary, though it is odd for the Romans to acknowledge both Ebro as a boundary and Seguntum as their protectorate. So we can conclude that it was between the time where the agreement was struck, and before the envoy demanded Hannibal to kindly butt off. \n\nAs mentioned in the last post, it was not the action of Rome that led to Hannibal’s reprisal on Seguntum, though some of the actions of Rome seem to have steeled Hannibal’s belief that Rome is acting in bad faith. It was Seguntum’s squabble with the Edetani that led to Hannibal’s eventual attack. \n\nAnd the envoy was not sent after Hannibal’s siege, but before, probably in 220, the same year as they executed important members of the pro-Carthaginian factions. \n\n&gt;18:40 Unlike his father, he has the advantage of been ready this time. He’s got an army, he’s got a very powerful base in Spain, and this time he feels able to stand up to the Romans. If there were ever a time for the rematch, the time is now. \n\nWhen Hannibal started the war, he surely knows the status of his army, and probably know quite well the status of Carthaginian’s military. He knew he had completely forgone the naval part of his army, and he probably knows very well that the Carthaginian navy was thoroughly understaffed. \n\nHere is what he knew he has before the war. Of the 200 elephants Hannibal claims to have, only 58 was available. 21 of which was assigned to his brother, Hasdrubal who will take command of the Spanish province when Hannibal set out. During this period, Hannibal had sent close to 16,000 men to Carthage and received 15,000 men from Carthage. These will be the core of Hannibal’s deadly army. Hasdrubal also commanded 32 quinqueremes and 5 triemes. Carthage has 55 quinqueremes in service.\n\nIn comparison, Rome has 220 quinqueremes controlling their now vast water empire. The water route is simply out of question. What then left behind is a land route, while the march in Spain would be somewhat easy, the rest of the way are fortified towns of allies and outposts of Rome. \nHannibal isn’t an idiot. \n\n&gt;18:57 Hannibal attacked the Spanish city of Seguntum. *lots of street fighting.*\n\nSeguntum was put under siege. I am sure there are some fighting, but mostly it was starved into submission. In fact, after 8 months without words that Rome will support them, the people were driven to terrible ends, as many began to eat corpses from starvation. In the end, those that survived set the town aflame, and throw their families and themselves on it. \n\nIn the scene, no much fire is seen.\n\n&gt;22:26 But Hannibal is out of their control. Carthage had created, without meaning to, this huge power in Spain, led by Hannibal who they didn’t really know, who had a mission in life that they don’t really understand, but this army was not in their payroll, they were not on the book. Should we make peace with Rome, can we make peace with Rome? No.\n\nAs stated before, Hannibal had swapped 16000 troops with Carthage. Pretty sure the Elders were aware of this. Also, Hannibal had requested from Carthage what to do about Seguntum. They said, do what you think is best. \n\n&gt;29:40 But Hannibal is determined to surprise the Romans and he won’t wait until spring. \n\nSo this is an interesting question, we shouldn’t ask why didn’t he wait, but rather why did it take so long. \nGabriel points out something very interesting. He said that Hannibal already knew the war was declared in April latest. And he has already recalled his entire army in late Spring, so they are geared, and ready. The supplies would be gathered and the supply train would be ready, especially for someone undertaking such project as crossing the fucking Alps. So why did Hannibal set out in June? He HAS TO KNOW by then, he probably will be crossing in the winter. If he left in April, then he probably doesn’t have to cross in winter. So why did he do it? \nLet’s look at the distance he covered, as that may provide us with some helpful hints. Hannibal covered about 290 miles between New Carthage and the Ebros in 38 days, arriving on July 15. But he took 43 days between Ebros and the Pyrenees, 180 miles apart. \n\nHannibal has to know the most difficult part of his journey is NOT in the Pyrenees, it is in the deadly winter mountains, and yet he took his time. Why?  Was it because he couldn’t cover the Pyrenees faster? Or was he waiting for something else? \n\nCarthaginian navy attacked the coast of Sicily and the Italian mainland. Sempronius, the commander of the African theater, panicked and ordered his navy to conduct anti-raiding stances (:p) and essentially halted the preparation to invade Africa, the homeland. \n\nThe Boii also began a revolt in late Spring, where they manage to ambush Manlius Vulso’s legions and trapped one in Tannetum, in the Po River. Thus, Publius Scipio’s army that was meant to sail to Massilia was recalled to relieve that legion. The key is it was only his army that went, so Scipio had to raise more troops, and train them. \nUltimately it came down to Hannibal need several things to happen before he is willing to commit on this dangerous route of no return. He NEED TO KNOW that Africa will not be invaded as he commits his troops to Italy, otherwise, he needs to be ready to go defend Carthage. He also needs to know that when he enter Gaul there won’t be an army that is prepared to face him.  He has been dragging his foot because he was waiting for words of these changes. He wasn’t taking on the frozen winter for immortality’s sake, but rather, he was waiting for the most opportune time. \n\nAnd this stupid video did not do the cool parts. Like crossing the Rhone. \n\n&gt;30:41 No one has ever attempted to take an army with elephants across the Alps. \n\nYah, because no one near that place has elephants. It’s like saying, no one has ever taken an army with pandas across the Alps.\n\n&gt;33:09 En route to Spain,  Scipio has learned Hannibal’s army has passed the other way, heading east towards Italy. Desperate for the glory of been the first to fight the Carthaginian, Scipio ignores the senate’s order and races home. If Hannibal makes it into Italy, Scipio will be waiting.\n\nOK so when Hannibal was crossing the Rhone river, he was like 5 days march from Scipio. In fact, during his crossing as he battled the local Gauls, he receives words that Scipio has arrived at Massilia, and his Numidian cavalry has fought a Roman advance scout team. So neither of them were unaware of the other in close vicinity. And the funny thing is, his 500 Numidian got beat by 300 Roman cavalries. Hannibal marched upstream and camped at Island, where he was supplied with cold-weather gears and food. \n\nScipio raced towards Hannibal’s camp but missed it by three days. Knowing now where Hannibal is going, Scipio sends his army TOWARDS SPAIN through the sea, landing in Emporion, whereas Scipio return to Italy and assumed command of the Po Valley. \n\nSo no, Scipio wasn’t chasing for glory, he, in fact, did send his troops to Spain, and raced home to protect Italy like a good consul. \n\n&gt;40:38 Hannibal is finally in Italy, and eager to fight his first Romans. He doesn't have to wait long.\nJust weeks after arriving in Northern Italy, Hannibal stumbled across a contingent of Roman cavalry near the river Ticnius. \n\nHannibal arrived in Northern Italy in November, in the land of the Taurini, modern day Turin, where he rested and sent man out to gather support from local tribes. He actually did not want to fight anyone. His army badly needed the rest and supplies the local can provide, provided that they were given enough reasons. Hannibal's war strategy really depended on how many people he can convince to join him in his war. At this point, we can reason that Hannibal has abandoned the idea of receiving troops from Spain, as his brother commanded what is left of his army south of the Ebros and made no real attempt to try to stop the Romans from going through the Pyrenees. He also has no real way of communicating in real time with Carthage to receive supplies, though he will receive some. Ultimately, if Hannibal is going to win, he has to convince the local that sticking with Hannibal is better than sticking with Rome, and that will take time for the Gauls to join this Phoenician no one really heard of. \n\nIn any case, when the Taurini rejected Hannibal's offer of friendship he attacked them and capture it in a siege. He impressed the local tribes that were quarreling with the Taurini by massacring the inhabitants, who joined him in streams. \n\nThe Romans didn't stumble into anything. They heard the fall of the Taurini and was able to locate Hannibal. The Senate recalled Sempronius and ordered him to help Scipio. Sempronius moved towards Ariminum, on the Adriatic Sea side of Italy, south of the Po Valley. \n\nSo Rome already know where Hannibal was, he just captured the Taurini's stronghold. Hannibal found out where the Romans were when tribes that promised him support fail to show up. He knew the gig is up, and he moves towards Placentia where he will meet with Scipio.\n\n&gt;41:05 *The Roman cavalry is seen riding pretty hard, some of them forget their helmet at homes. No one carried shields or lances. Scipio is wearing the right kind of cuirass but the rest of the dudes are wearing what appears to be chainmail? \n\nSo Roman cavalry at this point in history often fights like mounted infantry. They would often ride into the battlefield, dismount, and fight with the infantry. Which make them pretty useless. \n\nAt the same time, Romans wore Greek cavalry cuirass, so it has large openings at the shoulder to allow better movements. They would carry a straight sword and a 6 ft long lance that looks like a xyston. They carry Greek shields and uses Attic helmet. \n\n&gt;41:11 Scipio can meet and beat Hannibal now, he is going to get the glory for it. He wants a quick victory, and he is not afraid of the Carthaginian. Hannibal is also not afraid of the Romans. He knows and trusts his army he has been fighting for a long time.\n\nWe don't know exactly how either commander felt before the battle, but we know they were giving rousing speeches, according to Livy, to boost the morale of their man. \n\nFor one, Publius KNEW how inexperienced his man was. They were ambushed by the Gauls and retreated into a fortress until recently. They weren't veterans by any means, and they were left in the Po Valley as Rome conducts operation elsewhere because Roman commanders thought of them as, well, unimportant. So he gathered them and told them that they will face half dead troops facing hunger and cold, and 'all their strength has been crushed and beaten out of them by the Alpine crags.' \n\nHannibal, on the other hand, knew that his army was practically crushed and beaten by hunger and cold. They had a few days of R&amp;R, but he was concern enough that he offered Carthaginian citizenship to his troops if they fight well. Which in itself is a rare thing. \n\n&gt;41:33 *Lots of foot soldiers running.\n\nThe Battle of Ticinus was a cavalry battle. Scipio was looking for Hannibal, and Hannibal was looking for Scipio. Scipio knew the general direction of Hannibal, and Hannibal knew Scipio is around. So according to Livy, once they saw the dust from each other's column, they prepare for battle. \n\nScipio had about 15,000 men with him, which means he has about 600 Roman cavalries, and 600 allied cavalry. He would probably have Gallic mercenary horseman, totaled to 2,000 cavalries. \nHannibal, on the other hand, had at least 6,000 horses with him, mostly Spanish and Numidian. \n\nI want to talk a little about the Spanish heavy cavalry, a very special favorite of mine, and unfortunately, not many people talk about them. \n\nThe jinetes are the fearsome riders from Spain, their mounts are Spanish breeds that were excellent in mountainous terrains, and they would often carry infantryman into battle behind them. So these mounts are powerful enough to carry another man to the battle, and then charge and fight.\n\nThe Hannibal Spanish jinetes are also quite unique. They appear to copy from Philip II's model. Maybe Hamilcar had trained them, maybe Hasdrubal, but either way, when Hannibal took them to battle, he had these ferocious Spanish warriors on powerful mounts fighting like Greek companions. \n\nThey are armed with 9 ft xyston-like lances, with a small shield. They usually wear scale cuirass or chainmail, and they wield the falcata for close combat. These riders, unlike the Numidians or the Italians, will charge into infantry formations and break them with their lances, and then start chopping up whoever is right next to them. This was proven quite useful even against phalanx, so when Hannibal took them against the Roman in their less packed formation, it was super effective. \nBack to topic.\n\nSo Hannibal probably had an overwhelming numeric advantage to the Roman cavalry, and neither commander took their infantry to battle. Scipio did take javelineers or skirmishers with him. But Hannibal's Spanish jinetes charge so fast they broke before they were able to attack. As the Carthaginian forces pressed against Roman cavalry, they become mixed up with the fleeing javelineers which took away Roman horses' maneuverability. The Roman cavalry was able to escape but took some losses. Unlike what is shown in the video.\n\nScipio was able to return to his camp, and Hannibal withdraw to his own forces, as he does not have infantry to support an assault. Scipio withdraws further the following night, and crossed the Ticinus and reached Placentia under a day. \n\n\nSo the stage has been set, and Hannibal is now on the stage performing magic that will dazzle. To be continued. \n\n\nSources: \n\nPolybius, The Histories\n\nShean, Hannibal's Mules\n\nLivy, War with hannibal\n\nLazenby, Hannibal's War\n\nLancel, Carthage\n\nGabriel, Hannibal, the Military Biography of Rome's Greatest Enemy\n\nLinton, Hannibal Barca The Greatest General, the meteoric rise, defeat, and destruction of Rome's fiercest rival.\n\n",

Each winner will get a month of Reddit Gold, courtesy of the Reddit admins. We start with the \"keep the bot happy so it doesn't take over the sub\" category.\n\n#Best Snapshillbot Comment\n\n&gt; \"Africa didn't have civilization until the enlightened Western Powers graciously shared their gifts of industry with the primitive people of Africa.\"\n\nIn response to a post by a white supremacist website that made a whole bunch of false claims about Ethiopians and various Sub Saharan Africans. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5dbbae/white_supremacist_website_falsely_conflates/da36eo5/\n\nIt was a close vote, which is not surprising when you see the runner up:\n\n&gt; \"Actually, it's about robot state's bots' rights.\"\n\nIn response to a post on women rights through the ages.\n\n# Most Pedantic\n\n**/u/tiako won this one** pretty convincingly for [Was Spanish the first European language spoken in the US? Fact checking Politifact](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5bo5zw/was_spanish_the_first_european_language_spoken_in/). The post turns pedantry into an artform and inspired the commenters to turn it up to eleven.\n\n# Best Flair\n\nThis was a closely contested category with only a few votes between the top three. The winner is **\"The Noldor did nothing Wrong\" by /u/krdaito**, ~~but the nominator didn't say who it belonged to, so /u/Turambar9199 can you please ping me with the username of the person who used it so I can give them their prize?~~ [edit] Found them after a bit of searching.\n\nThe runner up here was /u/titusbluth with **\"Sputnik was launched by Asiatic hordes\"**.\n\n# Funniest Comment\n\nA clear winner here: **/u/tobbinator** for this comment: **\"Sources?\"** for a post debunking the claim that [\"No one has died in history\".](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vfo0r/no_one_has_died_in_history_thus_saith_my_very/)\n\nThe runner up here funnily enough was /u/tom_the_tanker 's reply to that request, which was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death. Touche.\n\n# Worst History\n\nThere were some really good nominations in this category, but in the end it was **/u/rmiller90** who won for debunking: ['The colonists didn't act like these protesters in North Carolina!'](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/545dbi/the_colonists_didnt_act_like_these_protesters_in/), showing that the colonists were quite possibly worse than the protestors, and had no problems with arson, rioting, intimidation, and some good old fashioned violence.\n\nThe runner up was a post by /u/B_Rat calling out Neil deGrasse Tyson making his monthly bad history statement when he claimed that [the roundness of earth was loss in the dark ages](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/44rs9z/neil_degrasse_tyson_or_how_to_fight_the_flatearth/). Oh Neil, will you ever shut up about history?\n\n# Most Unusual\n\nThis was a new category introduced for bad history that surprised you in any way. Maybe it was a topic we'd never covered before, something you didn't know, or even something that you didn't know was bad history. \n\n**The winner here is /u/tom_the_tanker** for the very same post that got us the funniest comment: [\"No one has died in history\". Thus saith my very drunk girlfriend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4vfo0r/no_one_has_died_in_history_thus_saith_my_very/). Certainly a topic I never expected to see here. Well done, and I hope your girlfriend didn't find out you used her drunken statements here. \n\n# Best Series\n\nCould there be any doubt that this would be **/u/ByzantineBasileus?** With a dedication bordering on the suicidal, he wrote a staggering amount of post on the [Deadliest Warrior](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5fwkf0/bad_celtopersian_military_history_part_two_or_how/), endangering his sanity every step of the way. Not satisfied with that (seriously man, think of the children!) he happily covered the worst of the Discovery Channel's history documentaries as well while slowly, but surely drinking his way through the world's alcohol supplies. DRINK!  \n\n# Most Informative Rebuttal\n\nThere was only one vote difference between number one and two, so we have two winners in this category (there wasn't a nomination for best media, so I have an extra creddit left to hand out).\n\n**The winner was /u/Style_History** with their post debunking that [\"Religion is the main cause of war and the root of most suffering in the world\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ec4jy/religion_is_the_main_cause_of_war_and_the_root_of/). The post is extensive, well sourced, and an excellent rebuttal on the claim made. One to save whenever you're faced with the type of person making these claims. \n\n**The runner up, who will also get a month of reddit gold, is /u/ucumu** for this post: [You probably didn't find a Lost Maya City - The post in which Ucumu destroys a 15 year old kid's hopes and dreams.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4iib55/you_probably_didnt_find_a_lost_maya_city_the_post/). Cruelty to children pays off is the lesson you're supposed to take away from this. Seriously though the post was an excellent review of what it means for so-called lost cities to be found, and why this \"discovery\" might not be one. And it gives a lot of detail on how archeology in the regions works. \n\n# Excellent Contributor Awards \n\nThese two awards go to people we (the mods) think have consistently contributed great content, but weren't yet nominated in any of the categories. Consider it a thank you for making the sub great award (and please keep posting). We nominated people for this award and added up the votes given to them. I then checked to see if they have actually contributed good content in 2016 to make sure we're not working with false memories. Enough chitchat, the awards go to:\n\n**/u/mictlantecuhtli** for their posts around Middle American cultures and regular debunking of some of the crazy transatlantic connections made by pseudo-historians. And often diving into the comments to patiently add detailed information to posts on these subjects. As an example I give you: [Pre-Columbian Murals and Norse Sagas Suggest zero contact between the Viking and Aztec, but Clyde Winters would have you think otherwise](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5f8sv0/precolumbian_murals_and_norse_sagas_suggest_zero/). \n\n**/u/chocolatepot** for her posts on clothing throughout history. Always well researched, written, and sourced, it's been a pleasure to get an insight into this, often overlooked, part of history. We found out that Jane Austen travelled through time to pose for a painting, wet-chemise contests in Regency times (I might not remember that one correctly), corsets that allow people to breathe, Mediaeval POC not understanding clothing, etc. If you ever find King Edward's Time Machine, this is the woman to contact to make sure you don't stand out like a sore thumb.\n\n\n# The End\n\nCongrats to all the winners, and thanks to everyone who nominated posts and voted. And of course a thank you to our nominees who didn't win \n\nAnd I'd like to give a general thank you to everyone who posted and commented in BadHistory throughout the year and make this sub great. Love you all. Even the Belgians.\n  ",

        "text": "Given the recent (R2) which led to (R2) and (R2), we've seen a lot of (R2) and people pontificating on the *real* reason the electoral college was created. Like the cause of the fall of Rome, any given person's answer usually tells us more about them than it does history - a history based Rorsarch test. Some popular reasons accounts for the creation of the unique American system are: \n\n-----\n# The Founders were afraid of democracy\n__\n\nThe reason I personally see most cited is that \"They were afraid of democracy\". Here is a represented sample of the [genre](http://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/12/21/electoral-college-created-last-chance/95655730/).\n\n&gt; Why did the Founding Fathers add this extra layer in the Constitution? They were afraid for our democracy.\n\nThe reasoning here is from an Alexander Hamilton quote in the [Federalist Paper #68](https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-68):\n\n&gt;“The Constitution is designed to ensure that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\" \n\nHere, another blogger agrees that \"A nationwide popular vote is not consistent with Hamilton's reasons [for the E.C.](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/12/ny_times_scrap_the_electoral_college_because_of_slavery.html)\" since Hamilton rapped:\n\n&gt;It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. …\n\nThis blogger then goes on to talk about how the E.C. protects small states even though that has nothing to do with Hamilton's quote or the thesis of his essay. \n\nWe'll get to whether or not the founders were afraid of what the demos would do, it is worth point out here that just quoting A-HAM by himself is bad historying. Just because Hamilton argued the merits of the electoral college in this manner, it does not follow that the Constitutional Convention created the Electoral College for this reason. The Federalist Papers were a politically motivated document writing by a politically motivated actor. Hamilton's main goal wasn't necessarily to write a historical treatise documenting why the founders designed the constitution, but to convince people to accept the new constitution. Thus, while the F-Papers can sometimes (often?) be used as evidence of intention, they need to be treated with a skeptical eye. \n\n___\n#To prevent a tyrant\n_____\n\nA similar, but slightly different line of reasoning for why the founders used the electoral college is [found here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-anthony-cooper/the-electoral-college-was_b_12897066.html):\n\n&gt;it was designed to prevent . . .  the rise of an unqualified demagogue\n\nThe author backs up his assertion by name dropping everyone's favorite bullet sponge, Alexander Hamilton. He doesn't even quote Hamilton, just name drops him. It’s kinda embarrassing really.\n\n___\n#To protect small states\n__\n\nAnother popular reason given for creation of the EC is that\n\n&gt; \"The reality is that the creation of the electoral vote system was to protect states with smaller populations from domination by states with [larger populations](http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/24884-n-y-times-repeats-falsehood-that-electoral-college-created-to-protect-slavery)\"\n\n\n&gt;The proposal was, in fact, called the “Virginia Plan.” It would have created a two-house legislative branch, with both houses chosen according to a state’s population. At the time, Virginia was by far the most populous state, with 747,610 persons counted in the first federal census of 1790. Even if the slave population had been subtracted from this count, Virginia still had 454,983 persons, far greater than Massachusetts, the next most heavily populated state with 378,787.\n\n&gt;Yet, the Times falsely asserts that “a direct popular vote would have disadvantaged the Southern states.” But the two largest states, Virginia, which had almost 300,000 slaves, and Massachusetts, which had none, both favored the Virginia Plan in the early days of the convention. Clearly, slavery had little to do with the Great Compromise, which created one house (the House of Representatives) wherein a state's number of representatives would be determined by population.\n\t\nI have no clue why the author is talking about the Virginia plan, since it had nothing to do with the creation of the electoral college. Rather, the Virginia plan was proposal for a bicameral legislature presented by James Madison. The legislature is, in fact, not the executive. Honestly, I'm not sure if the author is being stupid or disingenuous.  \n_________\n#To put the united in United States\n________\n\t\n[Letter to the editor](http://www.bradenton.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article122215934.html#storylink=cpy)\n\t\n&gt; The Electoral College was created to bind our states together. Without that, there would be no reason for a state to remain in the union.\n\nHonestly, this one is too dumb to bother with. Instead, I'll use this space as reminder to always use definitive statements with great care, like I just did.\n\n___\n#Definitely nothing to do with slavery. No way!!!! I will eat my hat if it is connected to slavery!\n__________\n\nFrom an above link:\n\n&gt;The New York Times endorsed the election of presidents by popular vote in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia.  The &gt;Times resorts to playing the race card by arguing that the original reason for the Electoral College was to favor the Southern slave states:\n\nDifferent above link:\n\n&gt;And it had *nothing* to do with slavery.\n\n[And](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/checks-and-balances/) :\n\n&gt;&gt;[R2] further allege that the Electoral College’s undemocratic setup betrays the institution’s origins in the political needs of slave states: states’ power in the college is based on their total number of representatives and senators, and the Three-Fifths Compromise originally gave Southern states extra representatives in proportion to their (non-voting) slave populations . . . \n\n&gt;&gt;But if you actually read the Founding Fathers, you see they are constantly trying to balance and reconcile two competing forces, namely the people’s role as the basis of government and the need to restrain and channel the shifting passions of that same people.\n \n\n___\n#The health benefits of hat eating.\n__\n\t\nBut if you actually, actually read the founding fathers, you see that along with constantly trying to balance those two forces, they also wanted to create a system that was acceptable to all 13 states. The electoral compromise was just one of the many compromises hammered out at the constitutional convention:\n\nHere is Yale constitutional law professor [Akhil Reed Amar](http://time.com/4558510/electoral-college-history-slavery/):\n\n\n\t&gt; the Philadelphia convention, the visionary Pennsylvanian James Wilson proposed direct national election of the president. But the savvy Virginian James Madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the South: “The right of suffrage was much more diffusive [i.e., extensive] in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes.” In other words, in a direct election system, the North would outnumber the South, whose many slaves (more than half a million in all) of course could not vote. But the Electoral College—a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech—instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count.\n\t\n\t\nNoted legal historian Paul Finkelman agrees with the assessment, writing this whole paper on it [PDF WARNING](http://people.uncw.edu/lowery/pls101/wilson_chapter_outlines/The%20Proslavery%20Origins%20of%20the%20Electoral%20College.pdf).\n\nHe also dismantles the other competing claims. For example, \"fear of the people\" probably wasn't the case since (1) everyone there was elected by the people (2)  Eldridge Gerry of Massachusettes, the most active opponent of the popular vote, was in the distinct minority on the subject. \n\nRather most thought like Governeur Morris of New York, who:\n\n&gt; began  the  debate  by  opposing  election  by  the  legislature, arguing for election by the people: He   ought   to   be   elected   by the   people   at   large,   by   the freeholders  of  the  Country.    That difficulties  attend  this  mode, he  admits.    But  they  have  been  found  superable  in  N[ew] Y[ork]  &amp;  in  Con[necticu]t  and  would  he  believed  be  found  so, in  the  case  of  an  Executive  for  the  U[nited]  States.    \n\t\nAlso, according to Finkleman: \n&gt;The  most  influential  delegate,  Madison  argued  that  “the  people  at  large”  were  “the  fittest”  to  choose  the  president. But  “one  difficulty  .  .  .  of  a  serious  nature”  made  election  by  the  people impossible.  Madison noted that the “right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the  latter  could  have  no  influence  in  the  election  on  the  score  of  \nthe Negroes.”\n\nFinkleman also attacks the small state theory:\n\n&gt;However, in all the debates over the executive at the Constitutional Convention, this issue never came up. Indeed, the opposite argument received more attention. At one point the \nConvention considered allowing the state governors to choose the president but backed away from this in part because it would allow the small states to chose one of their own. \n\nThe electoral college was one of the many, many compromises used to create the US constitution and was born from the necessity to give slave states enough power to have an effect on the election of the executive. It was not meant to protect small states by giving them a disproportionately high say in the election, nor were the founders particularly afraid of what the people might do in this situation. \n\nFrom Finkleman's article, the founders main intention was to keep the election of the president out of the legislature, thereby freeing the President from relying too heavily on congress. The electoral college was merely the way to keep everyone, including the slave states, on board.\n\nAll of the above bad historians, are taking true things about the founders - they didn't want uncut democracy, they feared tyrants, they protected small states - and applying it to this situation, even though the evidence suggest other things were on the founders' mind.\n\n\nEdited: added PDF",

        "text": "I rely on wikipedia a lot, but I've been noticing that it's historical articles tend to be very susceptible to pop history, and, in a lot of cases, it latches on obsessively to minutae, maybe I should call this the \"katana\" phenomenon or something.  But a very clear example of this is the bizarre cult that seems to have formed around the STG-44 and the AK-47.\n\nLet's take a look at the wikipedia [\"Assault Rifle\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle) page.\n\nFirst:\n\n\nWhat could be wrong about that?  This seems to be roughly where the rabbit hole starts.  It's the hitler fetish, and, to a lesser extent, the nazi/german fetish.\n\nThe fetishistic obsession with hitler in pop history, the idea of hitler's wunderwaffen.\n\nIt seems to boil down to the simple idea that germany developed this 20th century modern warfare before everyone else, and had these futuristic weapons.\n\nHow the germans developed the MP-43, but the Wehrmacht suppressed it, until hitler reached down and brought it back to life and anointed it the \"sturmgewehr\", the \"assault rifle\".  And that's how the assault rifle was born.\n\nAnd that's what the wikipedia article says.\n\n&gt;&gt;The term assault rifle is generally attributed to Adolf Hitler, who for propaganda purposes used the German word \"Sturmgewehr\" (which translates to \"storm rifle\" or \"assault rifle\"), as the new name for the MP43, subsequently known as the Sturmgewehr 44 or StG 44.\n\n&gt;The Germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept, during World War II...  They would soon develop a select-fire intermediate powered rifle combining the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle.  The result was the Sturmgewehr 44, which the Germans produced in large numbers; approximately half a million were made.\n\nWhat the article doesn't say, is that [the term \"assault rifle\" also has roots as early as 1916 in Britain in the form of the Lewis \"Assault Phase Rifle\".](http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2192)  (Part of the further apocryphal idea that ww1 was trench warfare and assault/blitzkreig tactics wouldn't be developed until decades later)  And of course that there were numerous intermediate round select fire rifles made before the STG-44 in germany, and before that, in other countries.  The best examples are probably the [Winchester 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Model_1907) and the [Winchester 1917](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a21631/forgotten-weapons-americas-first-assault-rifle/)\n\nNot to mention the stg-44's own german (and russian, but I'll touch on that later) heritage, in the MP-43/44, and the Wehrmacht Machine Carbine 1942 competition (where the \"first assault rifle\" competed with the walther MKb 42)  and the even earlier [vollmer machine carbine 35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vollmer_M35) \n\nAnother dirty little secret, which I mentioned earlier, are the origins of the STG-44 design.\n\nThe Russian origins of the STG-44 design.\n\nHere's the general design of the gas system of the russian SVT-40 (also the svt-38?) that, obviously, the germans would have many examples of to study\n\nhttp://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a50/NickStan/SVTG43-02_zps6ee92b04.jpg\n\nAt the left where there is the bit that goes over the barrel is presumably the gas port, a hole in the barrel where gas escapes to push the piston, supplying the power for the selfloading action.  You also see the piston itself.\n\nHere it is on the STG-44\n\nhttp://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/pics/stg44-sturmgewehr.jpg\n\nMuch the same.\n\nIn contrast, for instance, the american M1 garand has the gas tube below the barrel.\n\nBut, this brings us to another surprise, and another contradiction of the narrative where hitler's wunderwaffen, the STG-44 spawns the AK-47.\n\nThe STG-44 and the AK-47 are almost entirely different in every way.\n\nThe STG-44 has a \"tilting bolt\".  Like the SVT-40.  The AK-47, on the other hand, has something completely different.  A rotating bolt.\n\nAmmunition wise, the STG-44 got it's 7.92 kurz from a swiss designed intermediate cartridge, and the AK-47 got it's from the soviet RPD, a pioneering light machine gun whose design started in 1943.\n\nThe STG-44 and AK-47 do both have curved \"banana\" magazines, but the AK-47s is actually more primitive than that of the STG-44, the AK-47 magazine's lack of the \"waffle\" of the STG-44s (think the jerry can), meant that, though presumably easier to manufacture, the steel on the AK-47 magazine had to be one millimeter thick.\n\nBeyond the material differences there's another important point.\n\nDoctrinaly, the STG-44 was used as a semi-automatic weapon.  Like the semi-automatic american M1 garand contemporary.  The German manual stipulated that automatic fire was only to be used in emergencies.\n\nSo to top that all off, the STG-44 was used as a semi-automatic weapon, little different from the other semi-automatic weapons of the war.  It wasn't used significantly as a high power submachine gun.\n\nHitler's AK-47 was closer to the SVT-38/40 or the M1 than it was to the AK-47.\n\nJust about everything about the myth of the STG-44 as told in this wikipedia article is wrong.\n\nAnd at the tail end of the STG-44 myth, we approach the myth of the AK-47.\n\nThe myth that the AK-47 with it's rotating bolt was derived from the tilting bolt STG-44.\n\nThe AK-47 itself seems to be shrouded in the stunningly successful propaganda of stalin and his government.\n\nMyth would have you believe that the AK-47 is the child of a farmer cum soldier who was wounded in battle.  That this wounded soldier said, \"why must the russian soldier share rifles with other soldiers when the germans each have their own rifle\", and, in the creation of the AK-47, he was able to transform the soviet army overnight with his miracle gun.\n\nIn fact, almost none of this is true.\n\nThe first gun he designed was an ill fated submachine gun, mostly forgotten by history.  This gun, though got him a position as a weapons designer, where his early AK-47 design lost to the SKS, which filled the role stalin claims was filled by the AK-47.  A major contribution to the legendary reliability of this AK-47 was made by Aleksandr Zaitsev, accepted reluctantly by kalashnikof.\n\n\nKalashnikov, along with Alexandr Zaitsev and Vladimir Deikin developed the AK-47, which itself wallowed in relative obscurity.\n\nThe promise of the AK-47, and what this Stalin propoganda seems to trumpet, is that kalashnikov created a cheap stamped rifle.\n\nIn fact, there was a milled version of the AK-47 which worked, and the stamped version, which was a failure.\n\nThe AK-47 did not live up to it's promise of creating a cheap rifle such that every russian soldier could carry one.  The failure of the AK-47 was the success of the SKS.\n\nIt would not be until the successful stamped AKM that the promise of the cheap assault rifle for russia would come to pass, developed in 1949, with magazines similar to those of the waffled STG-44, 25% lighter than that of the AK-47s.",

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3jmhzO8YZE *added sources*\nSo I blame /u/ByzantineBasileus for not finishing up the deadliest warrior bits and... \nAnyways. First time doing this so please be kind. \n\nWhat I transcribed will be in the regular letter, and the description of the video will be in *italics*. \n\n&gt;0:32\nDriven by honor and glory, obsessed by a sense of duty to his homeland and to his father, Hannibal’s deeply personal struggle will transform the western world.\n\nThis seems like the central thesis of this video, or at least the foundation of why Hannibal. I just want to point this out, and return to it in the end to refute this. \n\n&gt;1:41\nNo one has seen, or will ever see again such a huge army. \n\nThis is probably about Cannae. Romans brought 8 Romans legions and 8 allies legions to face Hannibal. During the last period in the Civil War, Marc Anthony and Augustus each brought roughly 35 legions or almost 200,000 men. During the Jewish Rebellion, more than 70,000 legionaries besieged the city of Jerusalem. Trajan’s campaign against Parthia consists of 10 or more legions. So the Romans were always capable of raising such numbers and some. But what is interesting was by 218BC, there are 325,000 male citizens in Rome, 240k were available for military service, and this is the key reason Rome didn’t give up. Polybius said that in 225BC, Rome could raise 250,000 infantry and 23,000 cavalries.\n\n&gt;2:24\n*In Carthaginians went to meet the Romans, though seemingly forgot to wear any useful armor like helmets. They carry to battle with them spears and various other forms of polearms.*\n\nHannibal placed the Gauls and the Spanish light infantry with him in the center. \n\nAccording to Gabriel \nThe Spanish infantry wore white tunic gathered at the waist by a leather belt, much like the Greeks. They wore helmets with neck and cheek guards. They fight using a light round shield made of leather, wicker, or wood. They are armed with javelins and falcate. It is essentially sword-and-buckler combat. \nThe Gallic infantry was heavy infantry. Visibly not present in the video. They enter battle with helmets, large shield, and long swords. While some would wear the best chainmail, as the best were produced by the Gauls, other would enter the battle naked to the waist. They are larger than Mediterranean, with long hair, fair skin, and their crazy war cries, it often brings terror to their opponents. \n\n&gt;3:05\nAgainst any normal foes, total victory would soon be his, Rome would fall…but the Romans are different, this war is far from over, it will become a fight to the death.\n\nIn a sense, they are correct, Romans are different from the classical Hellenic thinking people. They see war as a relentless struggle, that must end in either total victory, or total defeat. On the other hand, the war was far from over because Rome simply had plenty of armies left. Two legions urbanae was raised at the beginning of the year and Marcellus had 1500 men at Ostia, a legion of marines in Teanum Sidicinum. That’s 17,000 men already under arms. Varro assembled 10,000 survivors of Cannae and entered Rome. Rome would eventually purchase 8,000 slaves and released 6,000 prisoners. In short, Rome would have 41,000 men ready to fight. \n\n&gt;6:13 Hamilcar watched thousands died, but never lost a battle, for over a decade he kept the Romans at bay, then the merchants of Carthage surrendered. Hamilcar was astounded. /Expert/ As far as he was concerned, the government of Carthage gave in before he lost the war so he was bitter because he was betrayed at home.\n\nHamilcar was sent to command Carthaginian forces on Sicily in 247BC. He commanded 20k while Himilco commanded 10k at Lilybaeum, Carthage’s naval base of operations. Carthage at this point have 2 strongholds, Lilybaeum and Drepanum, Rome controlled everything else. They essentially rotated 2 consular armies (so 4 legions and 4 allies) every year to deal with Carthage. So, while Hamilcar was able to win some battles, these are tactical events and did not change the strategic events one single bit. In the overall theater, Rome lost 550 ships and more than 200k men between 255 and 249 BC, this is quite considerable when the entire population was estimated at 3million for Italy. A census was done in 247 show Roman military age population decreased by 50,000. That is 17% of the previous census. So while Hannibal wasn’t exactly winning decisive battles, Carthage wasn’t the only one bleeding uncontrollably. Then cruel fate played a trick on Hamilcar. Hanno, the naval commander who was supposed to relieve Hamilcar, was caught by the Romans. His fleet, encumbered by supplies, was destroyed; 70 ships were captured and 50 were sunk. More than 10,000 prisoners were taken. With the fleet destroyed, and without supplies, Carthage was unable to conduct further operations. Carthage sued for peace and the First Punic War was over. \nCarthage wasn’t surrendering because they didn’t want to fight, but rather unable to supply Hamilcar. Hamilcar may wish to fight further, but he is clearly unable to fight without supplies and man from the home territory. \n\n&gt;9:39 Here, Hamilcar builds the city of New Carthage, and forges a new empire. \n\nHasdrubal founds the city of New Carthage in 227. Hamilcar was killed in battle in 228.\n\n\n&gt;10:16 In Rome, agents reported the growing strength of Barca family in Spain, something must be done soon to rein in their activities. \n\nActually, in 231, Rome sent an embassy to Hamilcar, where Hamilcar insisted to the Romans that he only wishes to pay the Roman indemnity. Romans were satisfied by that answer.\nIn 225, the Romans and Hasdrubal came to an agreement where they divide their influences between the Ebro River. \nSo no, Romans were pretty much OK with the Barca until much later. \n\n&gt;11:29 Carthage’s most powerful and exotic weapon, the battle elephants. Ship from central Africa and India, they were part of Carthaginians warfare for centuries. Train to thunder through enemy lines they terrified enemy cavalry. \n\nCarthaginians encountered elephants in 310 BC, against Agathocles of Syracuse. Carthage first used elephants at the Battle of Akragas, 262 BC. First Punic War began at 264, and Second Punic War began at 218. Less than 100 years after Carthaginians encountered elephants and not even 10 years since they first use elephants in battle. \nThe elephants from India are largely unavailable to the Greeks and Phoenicians. They use the North African Forest Elephants, native to Morocco, Algeria, and are now extinct. They are seven to eight feet tall at the shoulder, so much smaller than central African bush elephants, at 13 ft, or the Indian ones, at 10 ft. \n\n&gt;14:47 When he comes of age, he takes over the Barca war machine, with the determination of one day leading it to Rome.\n\nHannibal was born in 247. He took over in 221 when he was 26. Hasdrubal the Fair succeeded, or rather, was voted in as leader. \n\n&gt;15:33 Hannibal has an army of 46,000 mercenaries ready to take on Rome. \n\nHasdrubal had 50,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 200 elephants in 225 BC. These were not mercenaries. These were some Carthaginians and Spanish levy. On the other hand, Hannibal was transferring troops from New Carthage to Carthage and swapping his inferior Spanish troops for African infantries in similar quantity. So Hannibal was not leading a mercenary army when he left for Rome. Though he eventually acquires a large part of mercenary forces. \n\n&gt;15:43 It’s all very well fighting against the Spanish tribes… Rome is the great rival and Hannibal is going to strike at the heart of the Republic and its power. This means in the first place he is determined to fight the war in Italy. When the roman loses the battle it won’t occur on the coast of silica it will occur at their doorstep.\n\nThis is base purely on Roman’s paranoia. This all started with the city of Seguntum. \n\nIn 220BC, civil strife broke out in Seguntum where the pro-Roman and pro-Carthaginian fought openly. They asked for Rome as arbiter, and the Romans promptly settled the issue by executing prominent members of the Carthaginian factions. And then the Roman emissary (probably the same as those who deliver the sentence) waited for Hannibal in his capital, as he returns from his victory over some tribes. \n\nHannibal was consolidating his power, he just crushed the Carpetani and Olcade revolt, but on his return, the Roman emissary warning him about Seguntum. The Seguntines and Masallians were fearful of Hannibal’s expansion and were concerned about their safety. The issue for both city states is that the Romans agreed with Hasdrubal on the Ebro as border of the two empire, and Seguntum is south of the Ebro, and Masalia’s trading posts were also south of the Ebro. While Masalia was a Roman ally, and Seguntum placed themselves under Roman protection, that particular agreement led Hannibal believed that he obviously had impunity to do what he pleased south of the agreed upon border, but he was willing to at least listen. \n\nHowever, as the Roman emissary asked to kindly butt off, he rejected. It was, of course, unacceptable to Hannibal. He pointed to them that obviously, the agreement was for the Ebro as the boundary and that the Romans has acted unjustly in executing members of the Carthaginian factions, and also Seguntum’s land grab on Edetani, an ally of Carthage, whose territory Seguntum is located on. He told them that, in their actions, the Seguntines must now await the Carthage’s decision. As he waits for the reply from the motherland, he must have pondered what to do next. \n\nThere was obvious mistrust between the two empires, Rome had reneged on their promise to Carthage thrice now, counting their action south of the Ebros as the third. If Hannibal had allowed the Seguntum to escape unpunished, there is nothing stopping Rome from establishing more protectorate south of the Ebros. This would be unacceptable not only to Hannibal son of Hamilcar, but also Carthage, and Hannibal the man. Seguntum is one mile off the coast, and as Roman controlled the sea lanes for now, if he accepts Seguntum is a Roman sphere of influence, then he opens his territory to Roman meddling, whereas Carthage would have no real way of interfering with Roman politics. \n\nSo when words from Senate came back with the instructions, according to Appian, to do what he thought was necessary, he promptly put Seguntum under siege. Knowing Roman was involved in Illyria and their resources are committed, he set the stage for the Second Punic War. \nWhen Roman embassy asked the Carthage to turn over Hannibal, thus applying noxial liability and allow Carthage to escape any responsibility for Hannibal’s action, or acknowledge that they were, in fact, liable. Carthage at this point refused. They probably believed the Romans are only offering this as an excuse to say that Carthage wants war, thus there will be war, knowing full well it would be politically impossible to surrender Hannibal to Rome; thus the words of their senator -reflecting that view, said in immortal words ‘let your minds at least be delivered of the plan that you have been so long in gestating. ‘ \nOr as Livy wrote, ‘we bring you here peace or war, choose which you please.’ And when the Carthaginian asked that the Romans to chose instead, Fabius declared, ‘it would be war.’ \n\nHoly crap. 1820 words and we are just 15 min in? Can I show my source after I did the whole thing? And can I chop this to parts? This thing is 1.5 hr long. \n\n\nSources:\nPolybius, The Histories\n\nShean, Hannibal's Mules\n\nLivy, War with hannibal\n\nLazenby, Hannibal's War\n\nLancel, Carthage\n\nNofi, Roman Mobilization during the Second Punic War\n\nGabriel, Hannibal, the Military Biography of Rome's Greatest Enemy\n\nLinton, Hannibal Barca The Greatest General, the meteoric rise, defeat, and destruction of Rome's fiercest rival.",

I AM SIMPLY DISPUTING THE SUGGESTION THAT THE TSAT WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL, WHICH IS A THEME I NOTICED IN THE COMMENTS AND IN THE OP'S POST HISTORY.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nHere are just a few of the comments that led me to make this post:\n\n&gt; [+611] I am uncertain if anything you say is right or wrong. But it sounds like it's trying hard to deflect away from islamic slave ownership and pin it all back on christian slave ownership through apologetics like \"slavery in islam is actually privileged!\" Reeks of the same arguments for U.S slavery.\n\n&gt; [+40] Shhh. You ruin the narrative.\n\n&gt; [+128] but people feel uncomfortable talking about it because it doesn't fit their narrative about how only white people have ever committed atrocities. And that's already ignoring the fact that most African slaves were sold by their fellow Africans and that only a tiny minority was directly captured by slave traders.\n\n&gt; [+25] Sounds like those Arabs have some reparations to take care of.\n\n&gt; [+30] But nobody wants to hear that because white people are the devil, right?\n\n---------------------------------\n\nIt's a common point to make: \"*every group* has been enslaved/mistreated at some point, so why don't black Americans just *get over it*?\" That idea misses key differences between previous forms of slavery and the North American chattel slavery that these posters are attempting to brush off that make New World Slavery a distinct horror. \n \n- New World Slavery was an intrinsically race-based system, founded on the idea that black people were an inferior species designed for work.^[1](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40h2rr/was_owning_slaves_in_the_us_limited_solely_to/cyuasd4/) Because of this system of black=slave/white=free, it was *necessarily* permanent and inherited. In Arab slavery, on the other hand, there were cases where social mobility was possible, slaves had certain rights, manumission was religiously encouraged, and enslavement was part of the process of cultural assimilation/religious conversion of new groups rather than pure subjugation of one group for profit.^[2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml) ^[3](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3a9ea5/how_brutal_was_the_arab_slave_trade_in_comparison/csazzlz/)\n- In Arab trade slaves had a variety of roles^[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1zfgai/arab_slavery_was_worse_than_european_slavery_by/) but were primarily soldiers^[5](http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html), while in the Americas they were almost entirely owned for the purpose of industrial agriculture, which in Africa was the exception rather than the rule.^[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3sfu7q/why_is_their_a_relatively_small_african_diaspora/cwx3xys/) I don't know how worthwhile it is to compare pain but I know you can't get much worse than the conditions in the West Indie sugarcare plantations where slaves lived in horrific conditions for incredibly short lifespans.\n- While Arab slave trade did in fact \"last much longer\", I'm not how how that makes it \"worse\". Part of why the TAST was so devastating was how quickly it took place. The numbers for both trades are disputed but it looks like they are estimated at around 10-20 million. Obviously that is a very different pace of trade, and the TSAT sent trade into overdrive with devastating consequences for Africa.^[6](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/the_long_term_effects.pdf)\n- Finally, there is an implication that the problems of African-Americans today stem directly from the \"brutality\" of slavery, ignoring the myriad of sources... but that might be an /r/badpolitics post.\n\nNone of this is to dispute the idea that previous forms of slavery didn't have their own savagery, just to point out that you'd be hard-pressed to find \"worse\" forms of slavery than the TAST and that attempting to minimize American slavery through posts like these is a shitty thing to do.\n\nIf anyone has any other criticisms, sources, or corrections I'd love to hear them. The source for my information is *The African-American Odyssey* by Darlene and William Hine.\n\n\n^(*edited heavily with updates, citations and corrections because I wrote this too quickly)\n\n^(**stop downvoting people who disagree with the points I made, especially /u/silverroyce. the two trades are very different from one another and difficult to compare, so different interpretations are welcome.)",

        "text": "I was (again) arguing against some Holocaust deniers, who prefer the term \"revisionists.\" I pointed out that 99.9% of historians hold to the fact that the Holocaust happened. The response \"Holocaust denial is illegal in some countries.\" \n\nEven if that's true, which it is, that has no bearing on whether or not the Holocaust happened. How do deniers explain that historians in countries without these laws (e.g. the United States) still hold to the historical fact of the Holocaust? \n",
