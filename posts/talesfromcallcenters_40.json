(increasing the wait time of everyone else waiting to speak to an agent) \n\nThen when you explain to them that received an email with their tracking information you get something along the lines of \"Well how was I supposed to know to read it.\" So then you track the order for them and when you give them the information they don't believe you. \n\nYou explain to them that they can verify this information themselves by clicking the link that she was sent by email. \n\nStarts yelling and saying she wants a refund immediately. \n\nAdvise her that her order has shipped and cannot be cancelled at this time, however if she would like to return the item we would be happy to refund her minus shipping fees. \n\nAccuses me of lying about her order being shipped. \n\nRemind her once again that she can verify the tracking information by  clicking the link in the email that she received. \n\nContinues yelling and claims she does not believe it's a real tracking number. \n\nAdvise her that if she likes she can call Canada Post and speak to one of their agents, who will verify that it is indeed a valid tracking number. \n\nDemand to speak with my supervisor. \n\nAdvise her I am the supervisor. \n\nAsks to speak with my boss. \n\nAdvise her she cannot speak with my boss as she does not take calls or speak French. \n\nAsks to speak to the CEO (the fucking sense of entitlement)\n\nAdvise her that she will never be allowed to speak with our CEO as he does not take calls in any capacity from our customers. \n\nAsks who she can call to file a complaint. \n\nAdvise her that if she has a complaint against one of our agents she can file the complaint with me. \n\nContinues to yell and swear. \n\nRemind her that all of our calls are recorded and that if she continues to be abusive I will drop the call. \n\nSays she is calling her credit card company and contesting the purchase. \n\nI ask if she would like to be sent a copy of the recorded call to send to her credit card company. \n\nHangs up. \n",

Sometimes it can be weeks before the customer gets the call for the survey.  For the first several months I worked here I got glowing reviews and perfect scores.  I even got an award for how great my scores were.  There is also a bonus attached to those scores.  \n\n\nIn the last few months though, I've noticed a trend that is starting to make me very angry.  A customer will call in, I will do everything in my power to help, treat them respectfully, answer their questions, etc.  In the end though I cannot resolve their issue for whatever reason.  Usually bank policy.  Invariably I get the lowest possible score on that survey.  The rest of the surveys will still be very good/perfect.  But my overall score in that category is FAR below where it should be so I lose out on $150 bonus. \n\n\nFirst, I'm angry that the surveyed shitheel marks ME down for something they're mad at the bank for and second I'm angry that one score screws over my entire month from that perspective.  I was even told several times by a supervisor that I did nothing wrong and that he couldn't suggest anything else to do to make my score better.  Yet I still get saddled with the shit score.

One of the more annoying calls we get is from spouses or parents who do all the banking online but aren't the owner of the accounts. \n\nHad this woman today: \n\n**First call**\n\nWife: Hi, My husband called to tell me he received a call from the bank today asking to call back and i just want to know whats going on. \n\nMe: I see, well i can certainly look into that, i'll just need to identify him. Is he with you now?\n\nWife: No, he's underground, but i do all the banking, we have joint accounts so i am authorised to speak on his behalf.\n\nMe: Yeah i can see you have joint accounts here, i have checked your joint accounts and there is definitely nothing wrong with them, but to look into the reason for the previous phone call i would have to go through your husbands profile. We are open 24/7 so he can call us whenever he is available.\n\nWife: I have already told you he is underground, he cannot call. Why can't you give me the information instead. He doesn't do any of the banking.\n\nMe: For security purposes we ha\n\nWife interupts: I know all about your security procedures, don't lecture me on them, i know why you can't give me the reason for the call but you're not listening to me. (she starts yelling) HE IS UNDERGROUND, HE IS WORKING FOR A MONTH AND CAN'T GET RECEPTION. YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME WHAT I NEED. \n\nMe: If he has no reception how does he know he had a call..and how did he call you to tell you about it?\n\nWife: are you calling me a liar? \n\nMe: No, not at all, i was just thinking that if he received the call their may be some times when he has reception and as we are open 24/7 he'll have no problem getting through.\n\nAt this point she started ranting and raving. When this happens my strategy is to just go quite until they exhaust themselves, every now and then they say \"Are you there\" and i'll say, \"yes im still here.\" and then repeat my short answer \"you'll have to get him to give us a call when he is able\".\n\nEventually she says \"Well i will be calling my husband and telling him that we will be leaving the bank\" to which i replied\n\n\"well you'll have to make sure he has reception to call him, and if he does, tell him to give us a call and we can certainly look into his accounts for him\"\n\nAs she was hanging up the phone i could hear her yell out \"WHAT A FUCKWIT\".\n\n**Second Call**\n\nAnother call today i couldn't identify a customer and advised him to attend a branch. He was very cross and said \"But i have a million dollars with your bank\". \n\nI said \"well surely you understand the need for our security procedures. We must make sure that we are keeping your details safe so you don't lose anything\" \n\nHe is leaving the bank and going elsewhere. I love this threat. I don't give 2 shits that you are threatening to leave. It just means that i will never have to deal with you again. \n\nWhy do customers know the rules but think they are above them?",

But so many of them thought that just because they saw a payment on their online statement they weren't sure of, it was an online banking issue. One such call was from an 18yr old lad who had seen a debit card payment for about £10 on his statement to allpay.net and because he didn't recognise it, he was going to yell at me, the online banking advisor.\n\nThe call began with him explaining the payment in question before asking \"who the fuck do you think you are, taking my money you theiving twat?\"\n\nI explained I could only help him use the website but if he wanted to dispute a debit card payment I would gladly call our debit card services team and find out more. But instead of accepting my help he threw a bit more abuse at me then said \"I'm gonna pass you on to my dad you robbing bastard, see how tough you think you are when my dad is dealing with you.\"\n\nHis dad gets on the phone and I instantly see where his son gets it from as it's the same abuse in a deeper voice. But eventually he allows me to call debit card services to query this £10 payment to allpay.net. I call them, they explain, and I had the joy of giving the father the following information.\n\n\"Hi sir and thanks for holding. I've spoken with our debit card services and they explained that allpay.net is a common term used by pornography sites so their actual name doesn't appear on the statement. So that payment your son made was for online pornography. It's typically for very specific or fetish pornography as that would cause the most embarrassment if it appeared on a statement, and the more normal online pornography is usually free. So would you like me to explain to your son that his payment was for online pornography or do you want to just pass this information on?\"\n\nHe just said \"ok, we'll deal with it thank you. No need to investigate that any further thank you\" and hung up.",

Turn it back on, I didn't want it cancelled.\n\n$Larry: oh, well I can turn it back on, one moment.\n\nAt this point since it was cancelled it requires a credit check to resume it, runs credit check and now has an $800 deposit due to resume service.\n\n$Larry: since you want to resume a cancelled line I'll have to take a payment of $800 for the deposit\n\n$Customer: THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT, WHY DID YOU CANCEL MY ACCOUNT!?\n\n$larry: you asked me to, I asked if you were sure and you said yes. Anything else I can help you with",

However, from time to time a non-related call will weasel it's way into my queue and I get to deal with it. Today's horror story is brought to you by the billing department....... All identifying factors of this story have been changed in order to maintain company and customer privacy.\n\nWe shall lovingly refer to the customer as Mr. Dingbat. \n\n*Ring**Ring**\n\nMe- \"Hello! Thank you for calling Credits-R-US. How may I assist you today?\" \n\nMr. Dingbat - \"Yes, I am calling to get the credits I was promised for the last year of horrible service I have been receiving. I was promised by the last agent that I deserved a jumbo credit. (Yes, he actually said 'jumbo) I have been working out in the middle of the ocean for the past 4 months and my wife has been suffering with the issues with our service.\" \n\nMe- \"I would be happy to assist you today with your billing concerns. Give me a few moments to review your account and I will be back momentarily.\" \n\n- Insert lousy fuzzy Jazz Music -\n\nMe- Researching notes...... Sees that he call 8 months ago with an issue. Truck was rolled..... Customer never showed up, never called to reschedule.....  More searching..... Sees he called in again in 2 months ago.... Rolled Truck. Issue resolved........ No other contact made to complain of service issues. \n\n-Returns to Mr. Dingbat-\n\nMe- \"Thank you for your patience while I reviewed your account. I see that we attempted to send a truck out in April but we missed you. I also see where we rolled a truck out a couple months ago and resolved the issues. Unfortunately I am unable to credit the account for months of issues that we were never contacted for. I would be happy to apply a $40 credit to your account for the three days of issues you suffered while you had to wait from the time you called (two months ago) til the tech was able to fix the issue.\" \n\nMr. Dingbat- \" That's fucked up! I deserve far more than that! I called multiple times over the past three months about this issue!\"\n\n-Yeah, No he didn't..... You'll notice above that he's already stated he has been off the radar for the past four months -  \n\nMe- \"I apologize for the frustration you experienced with your service two months ago. I understand that service issues can be very aggravating and inconvenient. Unfortunately, after running your situation by my supervisor, we both came to the conclusion that due to the fact we only received two calls concerning your service issues that more than a $40 credit just wasn't warranted.\" \n\nMr. Dingbat- \"WHY WONT YOUR FUCKING CREDIT MY ACCOUNT????\" \n\nMe- \"I am able to credit your account in the amount of $40. Unfortunately, as I stated earlier because you never reported additional issues as they occurred, thus giving us the opportunity to fix the issues, we just cant find a reason to credit the account further.\"\n\nMr. Dingbat- \"Whatever, how much to just cancel my entire fuckin' account?\"\n\nMe- \"Cancelling your account is free, however, you are still under contract with us and will be charged $75 to opt out of your contract.\" \n\nMr. Dingbat- \"That's frucking (Yes, he said 'frucking') bullshit! I want to talk to your supervisor.\" \n\nMe- \"I completely understand. Please wait a few moments while I track him down.\" \n\n-Insert more horrible fuzzy jazz music-\n\nCall drops......\n\nMe speaking to my supervisor - \"So..... I guess he doesn't want a credit after-all?\" \n\n-THE END-",

We also offered to unlock phones after 6 months on contract, but that was handled by a different department, we only forwarded requests. Turn around time was about 1 week.\n\n\n&gt; $ME = Me\n\n\n&gt; $RM = Rude Man\n\n\n&gt; $RMW = Rude Man's Wife\n\n\n*DREADED PHONE RING*\n\n\n$ME = \"Hi! Thank you for calling (COMPANY)! *Reads boring script* How can I help you?\"\n\n\n$RM = \"I need to get an unlock code for my phone. I'm travelling abroad.\"\n\n\n$ME = \"Absolutely, let me just check on something real quick here.\"\n\n\nI verify that he's within contract range to unlock his phone (he is, yay), but he has 2 lines, so of course I need to verify which phone he needs unlocked.\n\n\n$ME = \"Very well sir, you meet our phone unlock policy to a T. Would be needing your phone unlocked for (Line 01) or (LINE 02)?\"\n\n\n$RG = (suddenly, inexplicably, very irate) \"NO YOU F*CKER! I NEED MY DAMN PHONE UNLOCKED NOW! GIMME THE CODE TO DO IT!\"\n\n\n$ME = (surprised, since our exchange had been pleasant so far) \"...uh, Sir, all I need to know is which line you need unlocked so I can forward the information to our unlock team. I'm sorry if I offended you (no idea how though).\"\n\n\n$RG = (frustrated sigh) \"Look, I'm going away to Europe for six months and I need the unlock code for (LINE X). I got a ton of things to do before I leave tomorrow so just gimme the code already.\"\n\n\nI facemonitor at this point. It is CLEARLY written in plain english that phone unlocks take no less than 5 business days to process, not that any human ever bothers reading terms and conditions. Here is a man who is leaving in less than 24 hours and decides to give an innocent phone slave hell over his idiocy.\n\n\n$ME = \"I understand sir, but I must advise you that once I submit your request it will take about 5 business days before the code is emailed to you.\"\n\n\n$RG = (near screaming) \"I DON'T HAVE EMAIL! JUST GIMME THE F*CKING CODE NOW! I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS SH*T!\"\n\n\n$ME = (starting to lose my calm, but breathes in mentally) \"Sir, I'll ask you politely to please lower your tone and moderate your language.

I cringe for the future fellow unlucky enough to tend to this couple.*\n\n\n$ME = \"Ma'am, as I was telling your husband, I don't handle the codes directly. I forward your information to the unlock department and within 5 business days they will email the code to you. I'd love to give them to you, but I simply don't have them.\"\n\n\n$RMW = \"JUST GIVE US THE CODE ALREADY! I KNOW YOU'RE HIDING THEM! YOU DON'T WANT MY HUSBAND TO GO TO EUROPE, IS THAT IT?!\"\n\n\n*I couldn't care less where your douche of a husband goes.*\n\n\n$ME = \"Ma'am, this is the option I have available for you. Unfortunately it's out of my department to be able to assist you in the way you need.\"\n\n\n*Some more scuffling sounds*\n\n\n$RM = \"I need to speak to your supervisor, AND I'LL BE TELLING HIM HOW MUCH OF A SH*T AGENT YOU ARE AND YOU'LL GET FIRED!\"\n\n\n*Breathes a sigh of relief since my supervisor had just sat down and ready to take escallations*\n\n\n$ME = \"I'd be happy to transfer you to my supervisor, but I must advise that you'll most likely get the same information from him, as our departments are quite separate. One moment please.\"\n\n\nI fill in my supervisor and transfer the call. I laugh as he face vaults from the decibal levels of $RM screams over phone, even audible in the busy floor.\n\n\nTook a break right after and silently apologized to our poor European brothers who would soon be defiled by an entitled idiot.\n\n\nI'm sorry T_T.",

I can understand for a but at a certain point I'm just done with the whiney bullshit from grown ass adults. \n\nBackstory:  \n\nThis ladies receiver wouldn't turn on, she's old so I'm talking with her cousin. They're upset because they have a black screen with no signal. Turns out the receiver won't power on. Went through the steps and ended up ordering a replacement for her. I could've been that guy that ordered a power cable and saved the claim, honestly I should have but I was trying to avoid a call back. Honestly I should've rolled a tech but with how things are they want us on script 100% so here we are. Shipping is 2-5 days (usually 3) and this is where the convo gets fun. \n\nOL:  \"This is unacceptable, I need this tomorrow, I need my tv.\"\n\nMe:  \"I understand the frustration and the inconvenience, however I cannot change the shipping time frames. Mrs. Old Lady I wouldn't get too hung up on the possibility of 5 day shipping it's usually about 3 days but with the holiday there is that possibility.\"\n\nOL:  \"I don't care, I'm a senior citizen and I am disabled (she said this like that changes things) and this is an emergency, I need this right now.\"\n\nMe:  \"Again I apologize and I wish I had a different response for you, however the answer will be the same regardless of what you say.\"\n\nThis went on repeat for 10 minutes until I decided to push her buttons enough to get her to escalate or hang up. \n\nMe:  \"Mrs. Old Lady, I get that you are unhappy but I've already explained this process numerous times, my responses will not change if you keep asking the same questions. Your tv being out is not what most people would consider an emergency situation. As I've stated you have a secondary receiver active on your account so you are technically not without service.\"\n\nOL:  \"Stop saying that I have a second tv, I know what I have but I don't watch that tv. I need one of those guys that drive by to stop by for 5 minutes.  I also feel like I should get a credit. \"\n\nMe:  \"I'm sorry but that's not how it works, you get a credit when you are completely without service, which you are not. You get a tech to visit your home when the situation requires one, this does not require one. They have other jobs to do.\"\n\nOL: \"Dogs?\"\n\nMe: \"JOBS.\"\n\nOL: \"Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.\"\n\nMe: \".... I wasn't.

She picked up, and she sounded like she might have a cold, or was sick - it sounded like her nose was really stuffed up, and I'm fairly sure I heard her blow her nose once or twice. We went about the survey as usual, and then at one point I asked her if she had a cold. She told me \"No, I've been crying.\" My heart sunk for her. \"Aw, I'm sorry to hear that! Well, maybe we can talk about that a little bit afterwards.\" We continued through the interview, and then we made it to the demographics questions. There I found out her name was Julia, and she was about my age, maybe a year older or younger. As we finished the survey, I went off script a little bit.\n\n\"That's all the questions I have for you today, thank you so much! It was a pleasure talking to you, but if I can take a minute to talk about it, I don't know what you were upset about earlier, but everything's going to be alright. You're strong enough to get past this and get through this, and everything's going to be alright in the end.\"\n\nShe paused for moment, then said \"Thank you so much. I really needed that.\" At one point either before or after that, she joked about giving me her phone number, and although it was clear she was joking, and it would've been unprofessional to accept it, and she lived across the country, I seriously almost considered it for a second.\n\nAfter talking for about a minute, I said goodbye, and that I hoped she'd feel better. Her response just before I hung up was \"Goodnight, handsome.\" I blushed a little bit, I thought that was just the sweetest thing. That definitely made my night.

Saying that the system wouldn't take his information.  So he proceeds to tell me how to fix this problem...\n\nDumb Customer: \"First thing you need to do is delete all my information out of your computer there and I'll give it to you again so we can make sure its right.\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, when you called in you verbally verified the same information our system asks for, everything is correct.\"\n\nDC: \"Now that ain't so, and you know it.  If it was I wouldn't have this problem.  Just follow along and I'll tell you how to fix it.\"\n\nEventually I talked him into letting me do a 3-way call to our IVR so I could listen to him navigate the system.  When the system asked for his social security number he entered in 5 digits.  Then stopped.  Then when the system prompted him to do it again... same thing, only 5 digits.   So I drop the line and go back to just he and I and explain that he needs to enter the entire thing.  He sighs and begins to talk in that condescending voice that means you are a complete moron.\n\nDC: \"I entered the whole thing in, your system just wouldn't take it.  You need to delete my information and put it in again.\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, a ssn is 9 digits, you only pressed 5.  That's not a system issue.\"\n\nDC: \"Son, don't get an attitude with me, I know what I'm doing I've been banking with you for 25 years(look and account has only been open for 9).  I think I know how to navigate your phones.  Just delete me and re-enter the information.  The little girl at the branch put it in wrong and you need to fix it.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, all of our employees are at least 18, so we don't employ little girls.  And besides, I can't just delete your information and re-enter it.  That is completely impossible to do without removing your entire profile and the accounts associated with it.  I suggest you enter in your entire ssn next time.  There's nothing we can do to fix the problem of you not entering in all 9 digits.  That's user error sir, not our phone system.\"\n\nNo matter what I said, or he tried, he insisted I had no idea what I was talking about and he'd been banking here since before I was born(I'm only 11 years younger than this guy), and that he would go to the branch and have the \"little lady\" fix it.

It's actually an older story but I read another that just reminded me of it and thought you'd like this. :D\n\nA few years ago, I was about 8 months into the job and I was actually interviewing for a different position in the company. I had to go to one of our other locations and rather than spend the time off the phones I just got to grab an empty desk at the other location and get to work after the interview with only one of the outbound supervisors a few rows over for help.\n\nA few calls in I got one where the first thing I heard was our hold music. I knew it was ours but the customer didn't acknowledge it so I just assumed there was a wire crossed somewhere and went through with it like usual.\n\nI don't remember the exact issue that the customer had but it came down to it being a browser issue. The problem happened on firefox for them, but worked on chrome. It worked on both firefox and chrome for me which I explained. Suggested the usual stuff (clear cache and cookies, update browser, disable plugins, etc). But the guy would just not accept it and demanded to speak to a supervisor.\n\nAround that point, the hold music stops and I hear someone else come on the line. \n\n\"I'm sorry for the wait, my supervisor is busy right now but they'll be able to speak to you shortly.\"\n\n\n...what?\n\nI checked the account and realized only about 10-15 minutes before calling me, the guy had called in and gotten someone else. That someone else was still active in the account. \n\nThis guy had called in and gotten one person, refused to accept their answer and requested a supervisor. Then three-wayed our support again and was once again asking for a supervisor while waiting for a supervisor on the other line.\n\nSupervisor-ception?\n\nI went to the other supervisor and explained what was going on and they just started laughing.\n\nSadly the guy hung up on both of us before either supervisor was able to help him. \n\nI'm still pretty sure all he had to do was clear his cache and cookies.",

        "text": "I was going to share this on Monday, but I needed a couple of days to simmer down. Never do I get angry at customers. When they're mad, it usually rolls right off my back and doesn't bother me. But this woman? It was like Satan decided today was the today to bug me. \n\n\n\nI'm not too far from getting off for the day. I'm super happy and just pleased because I have someone who is side-by-siding with me to learn from me. I like her, she's nice. We're having a grand old time when I get a call. It's 6:35 EST, which means we're going to have an influx of, \"I need to pay my bill, it's due today!\" \n\n\n\nThis woman was one such person. But oh no, God had other plans to test my patience and resolve. \"I need you to do the math with me over my account, it is due in 25 minutes, and I need to know why I only owe 48.00, it should be more!\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright, m'am, let's take a look.\"\n\n\nI take a look into her account, she's had nearly 500.00 worth of credits on her account. I explain the situation. \n\n\n\n\"I don't believe you, how many credits are there? I've had nothing but trouble with you people. With Amex it was easy!\"\n\n\n\nI go over everything with her, FOUR times. \n\n\n\"No one at MasterCard knows how to do math. You're an idiot! Get to the point, this bill is due in 10 minutes!\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course, m'am, I can go over it again.\"\n\n\n\n\"You keep saying of course, and then start talking about my previous bill! Get me a manager!\"\n\n\n\nI silently thanked the gods that she asked for a manager. I immediately put her on hold, and got onto the manager line. I explained the situation to the manager, and sent the woman on her way. \n\n\n\nI had to take about five minutes to myself after that call. I've been insulted before, but when it comes to math, I get pissy because I'm actually pretty decent at math. My side by side said I did really well at keeping my cool, but all I wanted to do was scream at this woman, call her all the names in the book and then some because I was just no. No. \n\n\n\nNot even an hour before, I was going over how much I bonused this last month. Walking home with an extra 400.00 in my pocket tomorrow, and I'm debating on whether I should blow it on video games from the stress of this woman. I'm finally calm down from it, took a couple of days, but goddamn. I didn't realize how fucking awful humans could be. I've had some bad calls, but this took the fucking cake. ",

        "text": "So this is something that happened to me many years ago when I worked as a debt collector.  If you've never worked in collections... don't.  Its easily the most soul sucking job I've ever done.  \n\nAnyway, at this job we worked in-house accounts from 4-6 months overdue in an attempt to keep them from charging off to a collection agency. At this point we were desperate to show that we could improve our roll off percentage so management allowed us to clear out any accounts that were mostly late fees if we could trace back to the original purchase and said purchase was less than $20.  \n\nIn this case, I had traced the account back to the purchase of a pair of socks costing $5.  The account was now at over $300 with all the fees and interest.  So I called the customer to give him the amazing news that we would clear out his entire $300 debt with a payment of $5 and he wouldn't charge off in 5 days.  I'll call him Red.\n\nMe: \"Hello Red, this is SirGuido calling from Collections. I've got some great news for you today sir.  My management is allowing me to waive all the fees and interest on your account if you will just make a $5 payment today to cover the original purchase on your account.\"\n\nRed: \"I din't buy nuffin.  I dont owe you a nickel!\"\n\nConversation happens where we determined that his ex-wife made the purchase.  Now, Red is the ONLY one on the account so he is the only one held responsible for this debt.\n\nM: \"Oh ok I see, well unfortunately since you are the only one listed on this card she cannot be held financially responsible.  You will be though, this will affect your credit but for $5 I can clear it entirely.\"\n\nR: \"Hell no!  I'm done payin that womans bills!  Somebody gotta teach her a lessun!\"\n\nM: \"Sir, I need to remind you again, this will in no way affect her at all.  No one will ever call her to pay this, this will never show up on her credit report, nothing.  She will never even know this took place unless you tell her.  On the other hand if you ignore this, you will have a $300 charge off on your credit.\"\n\nR: \"I don' care! That woman has bled me dry for tha las' time!\"\n\nMore back and forth discussion.\n\nM: \"Ok sir, I am going to say this as someone who wants to help you, not as someone who wants money from you.  Your payment is $5, that is not going to help me in the end as far as my bonus is concerned.  So I'm taking this time, because I don't want to see you take this hit because you have a false view of how this is going to work.  *calm, quiet, slow voice* Your ex-wife.  Will in no way. Be affected.  By this account.  The only \"lesson\" you'll be teaching her, is that you like hurting yourself financially.  By not paying this you are hurting yourself far worse than anything you could hope to be doing to her.  Please just pay the $5.\"\n\nR: \"Buddy, you will unnerstand when you get married, women will take take take until you got no more to take.  You gotsta stand up fer yerself and say enough is enough.  I've had enough, and I'm done talkin.\" *click*\n\nHe never did pay and it charged off.\n\nTL;DR: A not smart man refuses to pay $5 because, despite being told repeatedly otherwise, he thinks he is teaching his ex-wife a lesson.",

It was a genuine complaint, upheld that we  failed to make transfer to another account, manager listened to previous call, was told transfer had gone through but did not.  \n\nThis payment was to a relative who was in bit of a sticky situation unable to pay a fine.  She told him money was paid, but called back 4 days later saying where is it, so that is why she called in.\n\nShe now said there is no point making this payment as there was a daily late payment and other fees involved, so now total payment required was about £400. \n\nAparently the father of this \"child\", so called child turns out to be about 30 years old  does not get on well with our Entitled Princess and will beat the crap out of his if he finds out he has been borrowing money to pay for this.\n\nI offered her £150 for everything as resolution of case, she says NO, then rants on that I do not understand the situation, I said I do and sympathise, first its not her bill, secondly this \"kid\" is old enough to earn money to pay his own bills, thirdly why has this been left to go on so long allowing such a large amount to be run up.\n\nI went through to comlplaints manager who said ok we will pay this extra is she can provide a receipt for this, needs to go into branch or post it to us. \n\nWent back and put this to our princess.   She then ranted then cried saying this was no good, I asked why not, she then started going on that I did not pay attention to her and I did not listen to anything she said.  Sure, but  I took tons of notes dumb moo.\n\nShe then started going on how people would kick the door down and beat her up because they think she lied to them about the payment, further she said she could not ask for a reciept because that is something black people do not do, and how dare I suggest such a thing, if I was black I would understand black culture and would not even say this, so it was clear I was an ignorant white man. \n\nI asked what was so difficult for the \"kid\" to give her the bill and she can then take it to the bank for a refund.  Again she just ranted how that was not done and if father found out he would kill her as well, this kid would not like her asking for personal financial documents, she was just helping out it was not even her problem.\n\nShe then just went on saying if I understood black culture then I would just pay her the money, SURE.  The bank was uncaring and did not care, I told her again we did care, admitted liability and said as a gesture we would pay her the outstanding fees if she provided evidence and the bill.\n\nThis then went around and around for 20 minutes, during which the complaints manager had got fed up being kept on hold and hung up.  \n\nI told her what had happened. She still said she was not happy with outcome.  Called through to another complaints manager.  Came back and told her it would be a long wait, she said she had not time to wait anymore and can we now go back to the original settlement, I said no as it is not something to negotiate, went back to other line she then hung up.&gt;\n\nChecked the following day, she had called back straight away gave her sob story and said how evil I was and how I did not care about her, can she have the original amount, that was agreed to by complaints manager, obviously from banks Point of View we would rather give £150 away instead of £400.\n \nSo yes another unbelievably long complaint from an entitled princess who actually played the race card to try and get money immediately.   \n\nI need to calm down just typing this, that is how much this call wound me up!\n\n",

        "text": "Sorry, this ended up being way longer than I anticipated! \n\nSo, I work for a rather large bank in the credit card department. I got hired on back in Nov. My mother-in-law is a personal trainer and one of her client's is the Operations Manager at this site. He put in a good word for me and go me the initial interview because I have somewhat limited work experience and then I was a stay-at-home-mom for 5 years so my resume is less than ideal. All of that to say, things have been going pretty well. My team manager actually liked me so much that he said I should go for a promotion that opened up about a month ago. I went ahead and applied, and I got the promotion. But it's definitely not a \"better\" position, I just get $1/hr more and take a wider variety of calls.\n\n\nBut, ultimately, I hate this job. Even the good days are bad. The calls are back-to-back, all day every day. Averaging between 100-120 calls a day. The keep making the metrics harder to meet. There was recently a pretty serious threat made to the building (you may have seen the post) that the bank really didn't take very seriously.\n\n\nWhen I originally applied and interviewed for this job, I interviewed with another company as well. They didn't offer me that job, but the hiring manager contacted me a little while after to offer me a different position. I turned it down because I had already started at the bank. I reached out to her recently, and there are a few different positions she thinks I would be suited for, and I have an interview there on Wed morning. It's for an insurance company, working in the internal processing. No phones! Pay is about the same.\n\n\nMy husband accidentally mentioned this to his mom (I didn't really want it getting back to Operations Manager until I knew what I was going to do) and she said that I should stay at the bank because \"A lot of higher ups know my name\" and she thinks that I'll be able to promote up to a Team Leader position sometime soon.\n\nThey promoted me in less than 6 months to the other team, but I don't think it's likely that I'll be a TM without putting in another AT LEAST 6 months on the team I'm on, if not a year. And I really, really don't know if I'll survive. Plus, I really don't know if I want to be a TM anyway. And I found out that the Operations Manager is probably going to be moving/leaving the bank, so that connection won't be there any more shortly.\n\n\nUltimately, I just feel bad leaving the company after only working there for 8 months and after being in the promoted role for only a month. I feel like it looks bad on my resume, as well. But the hours suck (10:30-7), and the new job's hours would be 8:30-5, with an hour long lunch and no weekends.\n\n\nAny advice?? I'm really conflicted.",

I am now taking about 5-10 times the calls everyone else is, all day. It is constant. I didn't realize that I would the ONLY one taking these calls and they would be overflow calls from all of our centers...things that don't even apply to my original job description. The room will be silent, (small dept) and no one else will be on the phone, and i will have 5 people holding ONLY FOR ME for minutes, until I finish a call. I am stressed, angry, and overwhelmed with the amount of phone work I'm doing compared to everyone else and being paid the same amount. I realize I agreed to \"help\" but this seems to be my new priority and I hate it. I emailed my manager explaining how I feel, and asked if it would be inconvenient to go back to my original skill set, because I feel overwhelmed and stressed from the amount of calls. (I'll be out of the office for a couple days) She hasn't answered yet. I've worked in call centers for 2 years and this isn't something I've ever dealt with before. Is it unreasonable for me to ask to not do this anymore? Or would you deal with it? I didn't realize the change would be permanent.\n\nTL;DR Agreed to help with undirected calls, now am taking 5x as many calls as everyone else. Other people enjoy emails and other fun work while I take a call every thirty seconds for 8 hours for things that often don't apply to me or my dept. Would you expect someone to suck it up or be released from this task?\n\nEdit: just to clarify, our department doesn't usually have back to back calls. A call will typically come in every 5 minutes or so, and we do off phone work as well. So the back to back thing is not typical.",

Even if they can take a message or something, it can't possibly make you look good.

A lot of the accounts have anywhere from 2 to 5 different nurses covering different cities and some will be hospice or home care.\n\nSo anyways, most of these companies apparently suck at giving people the right paperwork or making it clear to them what they should be asking for.\nI sort of understand when family and private caregivers call, because for all they know its just some nurse from the company coming to their house.\nBut even nurses from the facilities that some patients live at don't know what to ask for and they sound all smug about it idk it just pisses me off. I work third shift so I dont like having to wake the wrong nurse let alone call three or four different people to try to clear one call while I have others to take.\nMy typical call goes something like this (NF for Nursing Facility staff)\n\nMe: \"Such and Such company, are you calling for homecare, hospice, or medical equipment?\"\n\n\nNF: \"I'm calling from a nursing home.\" (Well that eliminates home care I guess)\n\"Blah blah...(spews patient name and such)\n\n\nMe(assuming theyre calling for hospice): \"and is the patient with Hospice of Green Hills, Moonstruck Valley Hospice, or Too Lazy For Another Made Up Name Hospice?\"\n\n\nNF: \"no idea. (sounding all rude and shit) Theyre in City A.\" \n\n\nMe:\"All of those are in the same city but I'll go ahead and wake up three different nurses at 4am and have the correct one call you back so they can see about bring you diapers or hear about that report that you found a tiny, barely noticeable bruise the size of half a penny on the patient. (All calls have to be called out for our companies if the caller insists on the message being taken)\n\nThats just one example but there is one where we answer for two hospice offices from the same company and theyre in I guess twin cities across a river from each other. The company told us when they first signed up that people shouldnt be the least bit confused as to which office they are with because the cities are so distinctly different and on opposite sides of the river. Still, every damn call I get, people act offended that I ask and get mad at me because they don't know what city they're in?\n\n\nThis can't be normal.\nI have a lot of other gripes too but this crap irks me like no other.\n",

A woman called in, asking about insurance for her husband. Apparently, husband had been declined for some medical conditions with other companies. My coworker informs her that with their policy, he can't be declined (yay!).\n\nThe client keeps dicking around and giving excuses, and my coworker is losing her patience a little bit.

        "text": "Hello! My name is *Cannot Disclose Information Due To NDA Agreement* and I work for *Cannot Disclose Information Due To NDA Agreement* which is an inbound call center working with consumer electronics. I have been here for around 2 years and I feel like I could make some people's lives a lot easier with my tips.\n\nFirst off, my job is not bad, I am a Senior Advisor that works with very popular consumer electronics. I get paid 16.50/H. For every 80 hours I work, I receive 6 hours of paid time off. I get dental and vision insurance through my company(Medical is an option, just too expensive), I work a minimum of 40 hours a week, and I get as much overtime as I want with time and a half. Also, my company ONLY promotes within. We do not, ever, take a new hire and put them in a position hire than Tier 1.\n\nNow for some tips;\n\n* Do not work for an outbound call center. This cuts your stress and your chance of getting screamed at, cussed out, and called every name in the book, tremendously. \n\n* Be reliable. Show up early and don't call off unless it's ABSOLUTELY necessary. Like, is it going to cut out that much of your free time to leave 10 minutes earlier than you already do? Probably not. \n\n* Don't break any of the rules, seriously. Follow the dress code to a T, even if part of it is not enforced. Like, we aren't allowed to wear shorts here, but everyone does. I choose not to break that rule and have never worn shorts.\n\n* Maintain good hygiene. Seriously. The last thing going to make your job better is everyone thinking you stink. \n\n* Get 8 hours of sleep. Being tired and being wide awake and ready to go is a world of a difference.\n\n* Pack your lunch. This has saved me not only money, but TIME. We only get a 30 minute lunch and 2, 15 minute paid breaks so if you leave to go get food, bring it back, and eat it...by the time you're done eating, you'll have 3 minutes to clock back in...no time for a breather. \n\n* Use your 15 minute breaks to do laps around the building. Getting fat is a serious problem in the call center environment and the last thing you want to do is leave the job weighing 75 pounds more than you do now...it happens a lot.\n\n* Going off that fat comment, bring healthy lunches, limit your snacks to 1 per day, and drink water. Not only will you lose a bit of weight just doing that, you'll FEEL much better about yourself and have more energy.\n\n* Don't stop improving your skills. I, for example, have multiple technical certifications and I am almost finished with a BA in Computer Science. Keep learning and expanding your knowledge, otherwise you'll end up like those guys who have been working here for 8 years. It's not a pretty sight.\n\n* Show that you have leadership skills! Do not be shy, do not be scared to speak confidently in front of a group of people, and do not be scared to answer questions. Seriously, this is the thing that make or breaks you in promotions. If you want to get out of answering phones and move up to management, this is what you HAVE to do, no exceptions.\n\n* Go above and beyond on every single call. No matter how small and insignificant. Don't get jaded and become a mono-tone robot.\n\n* Take all the overtime you can get, and kill it in over time too. Not only are you doing great in your 40 hours, but that extra 10-20 hours a week, you're also doing just as good, if not better. That shows the managers you're not only in it for the money(Which you might be and that's okay!) \n\nThat's it. Literally. Follow those steps to a T, and you'll be getting promoted QUICK. This is my 4th promotion(Tier 1, Tier 2 mobile support, Desktop Support, and now Senior Advisor) and I've only been working here for 2 years(Some people I trained with are just now moving to Tier 2).\n\nI did it by following those exact steps. I was the 1%, when everyone else was sick of their job and did the bare minimum to not get fired; I was busting my ass. I might have hated it just as much as them, but I hated it SO MUCH, that I actually tried my hardest to get out of that position.\n\nNow I am on track to becoming a Team Manager which becomes a salaried position with a salary of 50K(With overtime, I made about 45K a year, last year, after taxes). Will I take it? I don't know. I'm on route to graduate next June with a Bachelors in Computer Science and I think I might want to move away from the company. \n\nI never slacked off, I never broke any rules, I always tried my hardest on every call, and I showed great leadership skills. Now, I also stayed healthy, but they won't ever tell you to your face that you aren't becoming a team manager because you're too fat, but that's totally it.\n\nGood luck out there, and I gotta get to work! \n",

        "text": "I used to work in a British call centre for a large online clothing retailer. One normal day, an American man (let's call him *AM*) calls to discuss payment of his order going to the United States. The conversation went something like this:  \n  \n&gt;Me: Welcome to [company name], my name is ____, can I take your name please?  \n&gt;AM: Yes, my name is Steven Banks  \n&gt; Me: Thanks, and how can I help, Mr Banks?  \n&gt; AM: I placed an order with you guys a few days ago and wondered if I could change the payment method.  \n&gt; Me: Of course, as long as the order hasn't been dispatched then that shouldn't be a problem. Do you have your order number to hand.  \n&gt; AM: Yes, it's xxxxxxxx.\n&gt;Me: Excellent, thanks very much.  \n  \nI bring his order up on my computer and at this point we have to ask the customer to confirm some of their personal details for security purposes (standard procedure). The order number the customer gives me brings up an order under the name Jill Banks.  \n  \n&gt;Me: Did you place this order yourself, Mr Banks?  \n&gt;AM: Yes, why?  \n&gt; Me: It's just that the order appears to have been made under a different name. Could it have been made by a family member?  \n&gt;AM: No, it was definitely me. But sometimes I call myself Jill, so maybe it's that.  \n&gt;Me: Yes, that is the name that the order is under, but because you've told me that your name is Steven I'm unable to speak with you about the payment details of the order, only the person who actually placed it.  \n&gt;AM: But I placed the order! My name is Jill!  \n&gt; Me: Sorry, but you told me just a minute ago that your name was Steven.  \n&gt;AM: Jill is my nickname!  \n&gt;Me: I'm sorry Mr Banks, but I would be breaking the law by discussing payment details with you as the order isn't in your name.  \n\nThe conversation goes on in this vein for at least five minutes, before AM finally gets the message and hangs up. I wrap up the order on my computer and write a short note, and then make myself available for another call. Within five seconds one comes through.\n\n&gt; Me: Welcome to [company name], my name is ____, can I take your name please?  \n&gt; Customer: Hello, my name is Miss Jill Banks!  \n\nHowever, \"Jill\" has a comically high-pitched voice, as if a man is impersonating a woman.  \n  \n&gt; Me: Am I speaking with Mr Banks?  \n&gt; Customer: No, I'm not married!  \n&gt; Me: Mr Banks, we've already been through this, I can't divulge financial information with anyone except the ordering customer.  \n&gt; Customer: I have no idea what you're talking about. Can I speak with your manager please?!  \n  \nThis is a relief, because when a customer asks to speak to a manager then 90% of the time a manager will take the call and my work here is done. I put the customer on hold and explain to my manager that \"Jill\" is probably not who she says she is. I then transfer \"Jill\" to my manager. A few hours later I catch up with my manager who tells me that he had to endure Jill for another 20 minutes before he/she gave up.\n\n",

(Or other similar letters)\nSo of course you go \"is that last letter 'M' as in Mary or 'N' as in nancy?\" (Or mike and november or whatever else you use. Point is its not rhat complicated)\nAnd the person just gets angry and repeats the spelling of the name without enunciating the trouble letter any differently and without even acknowledging your offered alphabet alternatives. I regularly have people do this to me and they'll repeat it several times while not offering me any \"T as in Tango\"s or anhthing similar. I eventually give up and decide I don't care about that particular call. If they're that idiotic and end up having issues because they didn't clarify the spelling of their name, that's their fault because I tried my best.\nI hate these people. Please don't be one of these people.",

        "text": "So, our overall crappy products take about an hour or six to update with us. If someone opens an account, we're looking at a good 2-6 hour wait time before we can see the account in Customer Service. \n\nSO, we constantly get the call. . .\n\n\"Hey, can you help me with X?\"\n\"I'm afraid your profile has not updated with us. It may be best to call back tomorrow if your account is new. If it can't wait, you can try back periodically.\"\n\"Ok, bye!\" \n\n\n90% This how it goes. The remainder of the 10% are baffled by the fact that the gosh darn technology isn't magic. Maybe my company is cheap. Yes, it is definitely cheap. \n\n\nAnywho, I had a good 30 minute phone call with miss crazy today. Maybe you know the one. She is in her mid 40s and starts kicking and screaming (quite literally) whenever she can't get her way.  \n\n\nSo, let me begin. . .\n\n\"Thanks for calling derp, my name is guy who works weekends, can I have your first and last name please?\"\n\n\"OH LORD, I CAN SPEAK TO A PERSON. OH THANK THE GODS. I WAS SO WORRIED WHEN I COULDN'T VERIFY MY ACCOUNT.\" \n\n\"Ok, we will look into verifying your information. Can I please have your first and last name so I can open the profile?\"\n\n\"YES, YES YOU CAN. Can you repeat your name again so I can write it down?\" \n\n\". . . [name]\"\n\n\"And your employee ID?\"\n\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't have anything I can give out in regards to that.\" \n\nAnyway, she started telling me about how some company she once did business with had her information and sold it, so she didn't trust me enough to tell me her name. Eventually, I guess some time after realizing that she had already put the information in the system, she decided to give me her name and email address so I could find her in our system. During this time, she was explaining how she had sent a payment to someone using our systems, and it had taken a month and still hasn't processed. The money was never returned to her account. This just isn't possible. We have different processing times, and even if the recipient doesn't claim the funds, we return them. She is stating that her money was stolen by the company. This was already getting bad and I was already fed up with her lying to me. I wasn't locating her profile anywhere. \n\n\"How long have you had the profile, miss crazy?\"\n\n\n\"Over a month you idiot. Did you not hear me?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately we do not have any records of this account. Is it in another person's name?\"\n\n\"No. What are you trying to say?\"\n\n\n\"We do not have a profile matching the records that you've given me.\"\n\n\"I'm going to repeat myself. What are you trying to say.\"\n\n\". . . I'm trying to say that we do not have a profile here in your name. If you have an alternate email address, I can try it.\" \n\n\"Are you saying you can't help me?\"\n\n\"Not unless I can get a profile matching your records. Do you have anything else I can try?\"\n\n\"I'M GOING TO REPEAT MYSELF ONE MORE TIME, ARE YOU *ING SAYING YOU CAN'T HELP ME OR NOT?\"\n\n\"Not with the information you've given me.\"\n\n\"So your *ing services are so *tty that you don't even know where my money is? What am I going to do? Why are you doing this to me? [she literally starts screaming and bawling hysterically at this point]\n\nLet's recap, I don't have a profile up for her. I am pretty much convinced she is nuts. I try to get her to shut up so I can at least try another email. This was a failed attempt. After 10 minutes of her cussing me out and telling me she is calling the FBI, she, quite by accident, admits that she was lying and that she just created the profile today. \n\n\"Well, we do have a wait time between when a profile was created and when it will show up in our systems here in derp services. That would explain why I can't see the profile. If you want to try again in a few hours, we are open 24 hours a day.\"\n\n\"Are you saying you can't help me?\"\n\n\"Not unless your profile is older than a few hours. I have tried everything I can and can't locate any payments or any profiles with your name attached to them.\"\n\n\"God *it, I asked you a simple *ing question, can you help me or not?\n\n\"\"Not unless your profile is older than a few hours. I have tried everything I can and can't locate any payments or any profiles with your name attached to them.\"\n\n\"That's not what I asked you!\"\n\n\"What did you ask me then?\"\n\n\"If you can help me or not.\"\n\n\"Not unless your profile is older than a few hours. I have tried everything I can and can't locate any payments or any profiles with your name attached to them.\"\n\n\nShe started crying again, claiming that I was being abusive and that I'm just like her ex-husband. \n\nAnyway, she hung up. I feel horrible for whoever has to talk to her later about how some guy sexually harassed her and tried to steal her credit card number. I have never spoken with anyone more condescending than this witch in my entire life. ",

        "text": "I have stalked this sub for a while and have enjoyed everyone's stories. I have commented a few time but really wanted to share this. I have worked for a US telecom for about 10 years. I took call pretty much the entire time. \n\nI didn't know what options were available aside from a supervisor (which I didn't want to do unless I had too), until about 3 years ago. I had an amazing sup who showed me the awesome opportunities in operations and the world of reporting. I soaked it up and learned everything I could. I found my brain works through logic processes really well and that I Excel(led) at it... (Sorry dad joke :). \n\nThe only drawback was as I was shadowing and being mentored by one of the most gifted reporting minds I have ever come across, I found the opportunities in ops were few and far between. At the time there were about 20 position in our center if about 1000 and they only came up every year or two and the competition is fierce. \n\nI have always been very introverted and didn't interview well. Last year a few different opportunities arose and I applied for them. One was a marketing analyst position that was managing a new employee engagement site that was being developed. I got past the assessment which was a challenge and got through the interview but did not land it. The feedback I got (always ask for it as it will help you grow professionally leaps and bounds)  was that I needed to elaborate more and really focus in on the question being asked and find what they were looking for. I was bummed to say the least but I was proud of how far I'd gotten. It did not deter me from my goal.\n\nSince I didn't know when anything else would pop up I decided I would do as much as I could to develop myself and show that I am serious about my career. I applied for our Peer Facilitator (PF) Program and got in. Unfortunately there was not a new hire class at the time to facilitate but I did get some training and experience coaching. I was feeling really good about the progress I was making. \n\nShortly after I was talking to my mentor (amazing reporting guru from before) and he told me I should start making more connections in ops as there may be \"movement\" soon. I did not hesitate and began reaching out to the two reporting analysts that worked with him and the senior manager of operations so they knew my fave and what I could do. \n\nSure enough within a couple weeks both of the reporting analyst positions had been posted for us. I felt really good about my abilities and the networking I had done, but was nervous about the interview. This was a much bigger step up than the PF spot. I was sweating bullets. I made it through the assessment and got my first interview. The supervisor I would be working under and the HR rep were both very pleased with my responses. It went well. I was ecstatic. I did not know how things would proceed and a few days later I got an invite for a second interview with the Senior Manager. I thought to myself that this was a very good thing but I was still nervous. \n\nI had brought my resume and made sure it was emaculate. The first thing she asked me was what I had to present... I was floored. This was not starting as I wanted. I did not know that was expected. I even asked around and everyone said I was good with just my resume and A game. She let me know that you should always be prepared for these things and I looked her in the eyes and said I totally understand and apologized. And then the interview began. I felt good about my responses. Was more thorough and detailed and thought carefully about the questions being asked and made sure I gave them what they were looking for. Afterwards I thanked the Manager and HR rep and left. I sent them both an email thanking them for their time when I got back to my desk. \n\nA few days goes by and I am getting worried. They had said they only wanted to take a day or two because they wanted these filled fast. I waited patiently though and about a week later the supervisor from the first interview cake over to my sup desk as I was on break. I was hopeful and then she told me I had gotten it. I was over the moon. After 9 years of phone calls I was finally off. I started the next week and my world changed. In my first staff meeting my new Senior Manger (the same that interviewed me) told our team that she was beyond impressed with how I took feedback in the interview. She likes to test people and she said I passed with flying colors. I couldn't believe it. I was humbled by her words and thanked her. Things went well for the first month...\n\nAfter about 5 weeks we had a we case from our executives and they announced a major restructuring which was going to consolidate our 5 areas to a single national structure. I thought this was a good move and it seemed cuts would be made at the area level and maybe move some to the centers for more support. I was sadly mistaken. The following day my director (one of the most intimidating men I know, not because he's over the top but because his mind is a machine and knows numbers better than most) asked me of I had a minute. I wish that I hadn't had one and could have hidden. He told me that my position was being cut. I was in shock. After 9 years and making it out I was losing my job. \n\nFortunately because my position was rotational I was only being sent back to the phones and not unemployed. I was beyond grateful for that but I was also heartbroken, angry, confused. \n\nI didn't let it show at work though. I had to make sure I was still being viewed in a positive light. After that week I buckled down and decided I was jot going to let this get the best of me. I decided to go back to school (thank you tuition assistance) and am now working towards my degree in software development and database administration. I was also going to go down the leadership path as about 60% of the ops jobs had been cut and I did not foresee that as an option for a long while. \n\nI was mistaken. Within 2 months there was a consultant role (step above analyst) opened up. They realized that they needed more people and you couldn't do 20 peoples work with 8. Granted it wasn't our centers decision to cut but executives.\n\nI was very excited. I prepared and met with my new mentor from the previous role (sorry forgot to mention that one of the analysts got the reporting Consultant Role my original mentor had when he got a promotion to an area position). I felt really good going into the interview and I had answered the questions better than I had the first time... \n\nSo wrong. I bombed it. The feedback I got was that I referred to notes way to often and was not detailed or thorough enough. They told me I knocked my analyst interview out of the park. I was just me and had a conversation with them. That hit me hard. I was not expecting that. I had gotten a little overconfident and over prepared.\n\nI didn't let this bring me down though. Something else would come along and I decided I would keep plugging away. \n\nWe had a job fair downstairs in our center and I went by the ops booth and my former Senior manager advised me to reach out to my mentor. She was applying for another position. She didn't want it out though until she had heard about which was supposed to be within the week. \n\nWell 2 weeks go by and nothing. Another blow but I was used to it and just kept my focus. I ran into her in the parking lot and she told me to dust off my resume. She had gotten. I was really happy for her. This is what she wanted. (I work mornings so it took me a minute) I then was really excited for myself too because I had another shot. \n\nI took all the feedback I had gotten (literally 12 interview in that last year. I didn't post about all of them for relevance and times sake) and made sure my examples were dynamic so I didn't need so many. I didn't know when an interview would come up or if I would get one given my last performance. I come into work on a Monday and there is an Outlook invite for... 10am that morning. I was baffled and just couldn't understand why they would have sent the invite in such short notice. Fortunately I got to work at 5 am on that shift and had time to go home and change. I get back to work and spend my lunch reviewing my examples but not \"over preparing\". \n\nThe interview comes and I am nervous as hell. I feel like the questions are lining up perfectly with my examples. I'm starting to relax a little. I feel good. The interview ends and things seemed pretty good. \n\nThey said they wanted someone to start the following week as this was a backfill and needed to be filled ASAP. Friday comes and I am thinking they are going to do a second round of interviews like the previous one with our director. No invites or emails. I am nervous again. \n\nI had home for the weekend and didn't know the outcome. I was a little bummed. My wife says we should get pizza that night as a treat. Kind of a \"sorry about your luck\"  consolation prize. I don't let it get me down but I am a lite bummed. \n\nAs I am heading home with our delicious all meat pizza... My phone rings... It's the senior manager from ops... She tells me she is sorry but \"you did not get the job\"... There is silence... Im thinking \"why would you call me off hours and tell me this\"...\" just kidding\" she says. I am torn between \"Not cool\" and \"OMG... Such excitement\". I got the position as a consultant for operations and I started that Monday. I was beyond excited and couldn't believe it. It is my dream job. \n\nSome specs on the job. It is a little bit of project management, reporting and analysis and leadership consulting. And pretty much anything else the center needs. I have learned a lot in the 2 months since being hired and enjoy going to work everyday. \n\nI just wanted to share my experience with you guys and what I learned. \n\n-never give up\n-network, network, network\n-take feedback anytime it is offered\n-ask around about opportunities that are available of you don't know. Don't wait 7 years like me. \n-I'm sure there are more. I'll add them later. Lol\n\nI know that was long winded. This is also from my phone so I will edit out typos and grammar later from my computer. ",

It means I'm getting a thick skin!\"*\n\nMy boyfriend looked at me, incredulously, and said that wanting to punch someone wasn't any better than wanting to cry. \"*I don't know where you're getting the idea that dissolving into anger is any healthier than crying. That's not developing a thick skin. That's just stuffing your emotions. At least if you were to cry, you'd be RELEASING some of that pent up aggression.\"*\n\nThat comment made me stop and think. I've somehow gotten to the point where I genuinely believe that being angry somehow makes me a better person. A person more suited to the job.\n\nThis is not healthy.\n\nI really thought I was going to be the person who avoided all the traps of working in a call center.  I was going to be helpful, friendly, connect with at least most of my callers, and have a plan to climb the ladder to a better position. I was going to come home beaming about how awesome my metrics were.\n\nInstead, I find myself have tiny anxiety attacks every day when I walk up the stairs to work. I keep telling myself the racing heart and shortness of breath is just a result of being a two pack a day smoker, but I don't think it's so much that. I come home, my head absolutely ringing with the voices of over 80 strangers having talked into my ear. (80 calls a day is a SLOW day). It leaves me to feel like my boyfriend even asking how my day was is just too much interaction to deal with.\n\nAnd I love the guy. It's upsetting to me that I'm finding his want to connect to me aggravating and overwhelming.\n\nI'm experiencing SERIOUS physical side effects of stress, one of them being that I have lost half my hair. Like, literally. Finding headbands and the right hair styles to cover the bald spots has become a full time job of its own. \n\nThe sane answer to all of this is to quit my job. I can't. I'm completely unskilled, no degrees, no special computer or manual skills. I spent the last 10 years as a housekeeper. Cleaning toilets doesn't exactly look great on a resume.\n\nFor unskilled applicants, this is also literally the best job in town. I make almost 13 dollars an hour. I don't live *comfortably*, (rent is sky high) but at least with this job I'm not begging everyone around me for money to buy a damn gallon of milk. \n\nThe manual labor jobs in town don't pay that much, either, and my body isn't up for hard labor anymore.\n\nSchool is out of the question, too, as mistakes in the past wound up eating all of my Pell and free-school government money.\n\nSo I've essentially worked myself into a corner. A bald, brain-dead, pick-fights-with-the-boyfriend-over-stupid-shit, corner. This job is the first one where I've EVER made enough money to cover most of my bills, has health insurance (NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE), which since my hair is falling out, I need.\n\nI've got a doctor's appointment in a couple of weeks to see what the hell is going on. But I have a feeling the answer is going to be \"*You are under stress. Do something about it.*\"\n\nI've started working out five days a week, cut back on almost all sugar, and am doing daily meditations to help with stress. I got my PS3 fixed so I can zone out to that. But...and this is the first time I think I've been able to admit it....\n\nNone of that is helping. It's not helping and I feel overwhelmed and nervous about everything these days.\n\nThanks for listening. I just can't admit this to anyone in my personal life yet. I'm so glad I can admit it to you guys.",

        "text": "Hi, everyone! It's been a while. Today I come with a funny encounter with a financial service company who tried to intimidate a customer service agent, me, over a table.\n\n\nSo basically, I get a call from one of the associates of this financial service company trying to dispute a report from one of our repair techs. Basically, these guys bought a dining room table that they use for their office meetings. It's a big, expensive table, from one of our higher end vendors. He's claiming that clear coat is coming off by itself. I look at the report and it seems the tech is claiming these lines on the table are caused by gold markers. Mr. Associate says it's non sense and they don't use gold ink pen or marker.\n\nI looked over the pictures and the markings do seem a bit odd. I decide to give the guy the benefit of the doubt and send a second opinion...\n\n&gt;Me: Okay sir, so I'll be happy to send a second opinion out to your home. If they advise differently we can assist but if they advise the same this case will be closed.\n\n&gt;Customer: I appreciate that. I want it also noted that the cause of the issue is these cork matts we use to cover the table. Every time we lift it it up it leaves those marks. That shouldnt happen to such an expensive table.\n\n&gt;Me: I understand.\n\n&gt;Customer: Now, I just want to let you know that we have a lot of clientele, high value clientele, that see this table and it's hard to recommend to them where we got it in the current condition it's in. So if you guys take care of it, we'll be happy to recommend you and say you guys are the best. But if you refuse to help us and claim that we have gold pen we will post this all over our company's Facebook wall and Twitter account and tell everybody to never go to your stores. Don't take that as a threat. We would just like the opportunity help spread your company's name in a positive light.\n\n&gt;Me: ...\n\n&gt;Me: Well sir in light of this new information you've provided if the cork matts are doing this to the furniture then we definitely cannot cover it. \n\n&gt;Customer: No?\n\n&gt;Me: No, sir, I apologize. We only cover warranty defects not outside damage.\n\n&gt;Customer: I'm going to let everybody know how horribly I'm being treated as a customer.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry for the frustration. If you feel you have to do that that's your prerogative. Now did you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Dumbass?\n\n&gt;Customer: No, and it's pronounced \"doom-ahss\" and I would appreciate being called by my proper name.\n\n&gt;Me: My apologies Mr. Doom-ahss. Have a great day and thank you for shopping with us!\n\n*Click*\n\nSad really. I was going to send out the service anyway because I figured I'd give the benefit of the doubt and just pretend I didnt hear that part about the matts. Now it's marked on a recorded line and noted on his account forever. Maybe that'll teach him to keep his mouth shut.",

This one is from December or January.\n\nA TV star of A reality show calls in because of a $200 international usage charge on her bill. This particular charge can be cut down to about $120 had she had a package for this specific usage.\n\nSo, she talks to first agent who informs her of what he can bring it down to and she is not happy and wants to speak with a supervisor, queue me.\n\nMe: hello ma'am, I am more than willing to assist you and help you reduce that charge but we are unable to remove that charge since there was usage. Since this was on a cruise ship the rates are higher as these are the rates agreed upon between (company) and (cruise line).\n\nTV: I am from (show name) and if you are unwilling to do this I post in Twitter, Facebook and call the local TV station and let them know (company name) is the worst\n\nNow I didn't believe her at first until I looked up her name after the call and yup, real TV star and the bitch of a character she plays is no act, maybe a first in reality TV.\n\nHad to call over to our PR Dept so they could get a jump on it, sadly my name nor the company showed up on Twitter, thought I would be famous for a moment.\n\nBut seriously lady, you work on TV, you have more money than I ever will, pay your damn bill.",

        "text": "I've been working in a call center for 9 1/2 years as technical support for an ISP. I've liked my job for the most part, and I've had quite a few roles over the years. TSR, Mentor, Lead TSR, Outbound Survey, and Sub-Supervisor. I've treated each call like a puzzle, working to solve each issue, and look to the next one. Lately, the puzzles have become stagnant, and repetitive. \n\nOne of the roles I wanted to get into was NOC, so when I left our Lead Line and went back to the floor, I went back to school. I majored in IT, Network Administration and Design specifically. I learned everything I could to prepare myself for a NOC position and beyond. Finally, a few months ago, I interviewed for NOC. Wasn't the first time I put in for it but it was the first time I got an interview. Waited a few weeks, followed up with the NOC Supervisor, and one morning I got a message from him to come over because he wanted to talk to me. I was excited and went over with a smile. It didn't last. I was rejected for another candidate. So I asked what I should focus on so I might have a better chance next time. The answer: \"We want to promote primarily from the Lead Line.\"\n\nI was pissed. I was on the Lead Line for almost 3 years before going back to the floor and starting school. It was a slap in the face. \n\nSo with the help of a friend, I polished up the old resume, and started applying to jobs around the area.\n\nLast week, I interviewed for a Field Service IT Specialist position for a security monitoring company, and was offered the job today. I'll be driving a van, be the contact person for whenever the Field Service Technicians have issues with firewalls, switches, and pretty much anything network related. In the down time, I'll be servicing and troubleshooting security systems. It'll be about 75% IT and 25% field service. It also starts at over $2 more an hour than what I make right now. I start on July 11th. I can't wait.\n\nEven better, the security company is owned by the same parent company that owns my current employer. So my 9 1/2 years of tenure keeps going with this company and all of my vacation time will be the same each year instead of starting with just 2 weeks.\n\nBonus:\nToday a woman told me that she hoped that something happened to me and that my wife wouldn't be able to use the phone to call for help. She also told me that I need to come down there so that her brother who is a \"black belt\" could kick my ass because I couldn't fix her phone. It was already being worked on.",

        "text": "There are a few calls I dread, especially when I deal with the elderly. Anything relating to money that they are owed is the time when I cringe and prepare to be yelled at. \n\nThis is probably my favorite call ever and it started with me being so on edge. This guy was calling because he had enrolled in a medicare advantage plan in January and neglected to cancel out of his medicare supplement plan. I HATE these calls! The main reason they piss me off so much is we have to cancel it to the current month and then inform the member they need to send us proof of when the advantage plan went into effect.\n\nAll this boils down to that means they have to wait on a refund to be issued and since our refunds take up to 30 days to process, it makes it even less desirable to tell someone.\n\nSo I braced myself, and hit him with the news. The guy laughed and said that's fine as long as he can get it so he go hit up the casinos. I stopped being tensed and began small talk about casinos, telling the caller how much I loved black jack. he said he prefers roulette. I said I have no idea how to play that so he began trying to teach me over the phone.\n\nI get to the end of the call. I ask if there's anything else and he asked me for lottery numbers. I get asked that a lot as a joke and I told him the same thing I always tell someone when they ask that... I'll give them random numbers, but if they win, I want a cut. The caller laughed and then said he'd give me 10% and buy me a new car.\n\nHe then asked me if I was single. I told him for me it's complicated because the person I'm infatuated with lives in a different country. He then asked me if I ever watched the Big Bang Theory because he was referencing a relationship on the show with one character living in India, and another in California. I asked if that's what he was getting at and he says \"yeah, when she's in India screwing other guys and he's at home yanking his pud.\"\n\nAt this point I knew this guy was amazing and was crying from laughing so hard and then he decided to do real talk and offered me some advice. He said \"listen when you find a woman you need to make sure they have a good heart and a good brain because EVERY woman has a twat!\"\n\nIt was at this point that I was getting a headache from laughing that I bid him farewell and realized this was a story I would definitely have to tell again.",

I spend the last 90 minutes of my shift on floor support, helping some of the people who have been here for years. \n\n\n\nOn Sunday, I get pulled for it all day. I'm okay with this, especially because the new hires are doe-eyed and looking confused as to what the hell they're doing. I walked in a bit early, went up to my manager to ask him what the plan was for me today, and he says, \"Well, actually, we need you for floor support.\" Okay. \n\n\n\nLiterally hands were up every five seconds from the newbies on the floor. \"How do I waive this fee?\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you waive this interest?\" Lol no, I'm not waiving 90.00 in interest, when it's perfectly valid. \"I thought we were supposed to wave down managers to waive it.\"\n\n\n\"Well, on a slow day, sure. Tomorrow though? Better send that PID to a manager to have them take a look.\" Mondays are always back to back, after all. \n\n\n\nIt was kind of nice being off the phones for an entire day.
