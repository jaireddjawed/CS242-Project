Eventually I work it out but it’s very hard for me to focus and keep the numbers in my head to solve a problem. Is this something that can be helped with practice or will I just have to work around this? (I have ADHD and take meds for it but it doesn’t seem to help this particular issue.)",

Here is the formula:\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlr8a7pb3ska1.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ecec915cdca61cc67551d0b53f5dd1528dc13aaf\n\nFor Hpmax, and HP I'm just using 20. \n\nFor the 'rate' I'm using 45 (the lower the rate the harder it is to catch, with a max of 255). \n\nFor bonusball I'm using 1x (this is if you use a regular pokéball)\n\nand then the bonusstatus is also since there is no status for the enemy pokemon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow when I calculate this I get 6000.  \nThen I calculate 'b';\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxvnfmzz3ska1.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=55f04d4859ff637d450ab877f4f299c5dc921b48\n\nI round to number to an integer, and I get 149794.  \nNow I have to pick a random number between 0 and 65536 (inclusive) and compare it to 'b'.\n\nif b is greater or equal to the random number, the pokemon is not caught.  \n\n\nThe problem I have here is that the random number can never be greater than 'a' (149794 in this case),  \nthus I will always catch the pokemon.  \n\n\nHere is what I have in C# \n\n  \n\n\n[The first 3 lines is where I do the math](https://preview.redd.it/yunre0595ska1.png?width=923&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cc1b18a883da145e9fc7841333543edc2e4e4cb5)\n\nIf anyone can tell me if I did something wrong? Maybe I'm missing something or perhaps there is a rule I don't know of.

I want to study complex analysis and any other field related to the Riemann Hypothesis. But I don't think I have the mental framework to rigorously study math.\n\nHowever, I am a very good rule follower. I'm very strict with myself, so I figured that as long as I have a strong foundation with which to study math, then I'll be able to succeed here as long as I follow whatever principles those are. So what might these principles be? What should my mind be thinking whenever I sit down with whatever complex analysis book I choose? What habits should I develop? Should I solve every exercise in the book? For each exercise, should I write out each step on how to solve it by hand? Should I memorize any theorems? \n\nI'll admit that my end goal is pretty ill defined - I want to try to tackle the Riemann Hypothesis. In the end I expect to simply \"know a lot about it and be able to answer a lot of questions about it\". Maybe even be able to do PhD level work on the topic. But again, that's very vague. I'm aware, and I'll deal with making that more precise as I go along. But for now, I just want someone to teach me *how to study math well*.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI recently became aware that the number of sequences of 1’s and 2’s that sum to n is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Since it’s easy to see that the answers for n=1 and n=2 are 1 and 2, understanding this fact comes down to understanding why the answers for successive n’s obey the Fibonacci recurrence relation.\n\nFor someone who does math every day, it’s not hard to see that the answer is the sum, as k ranges from 0 to floor(n/2), of n-k choose k. After that, the fact that these sums obey the FRR can be proven using the Pascalian recurrence relation that the binomial coefficients obey. This is the harder part because there’s some fine details to take care of: as far as I can tell, you’d have to use proof by cases to show that #(n) = #(n-1) + #(n-2) depending whether n is odd or even. Not necessarily what you’d call a “pretty” proof.\n\nBut does there exist a proof of this fact that could be understood by someone of any background, which doesn’t utilize binomial coefficients? I ask because I want to grow my repertoire of non-obvious math results that can be explained in ways that are both satisfying and highly non-technical.\n\nThanks!",

But when I think more deeply, 9, 5, +, =, and 14 are all just symbols really. And we have to give them meaning, through axioms and defintions. But I'm struggling to think about what sorts of axioms or defintions that could be formulated so that we get all the nice properties of the set of symbols we call the natural numbers.\n\nThis seems even harder to think about when you move beyond the naturals, to the rational, irrationals, and real numbers.\n\nAny insight or resources into this question would be appreciated.

        "text": "What is an accurate mental model for the behavior of a reflective brownian motion near a reflective boundary?\n\n\nFrom what I understood so far, if we, at a point P, start a reflective brownian motion process in 2D near a reflective half-space boundary, the expected value will be equivalent to the situation in which the reflective boundary is replaced by another identical BM started at the reflection of P in the boundary. This makes intuitive sense until a second reflective boundary is added.\n\n\nIn the analogy above, what would happen if we start a reflective brownian motion near a reflective right angle corner? Would this be equivalent in expected value to replacing the corner boundary with two other brownian motion processes, each reflected in one side of the corner? This doesn't seem right since if we enlarge the corner angle, when it's close to pi we would have the boundary replaced by two epsilon-close brownian motion processes, a clear contradiction to the above. I'm tempted to think that in this case we would have to pick one side of the corner or the other since that's what a random walk would do, but could not fully finalize the thought on how it would work. For example, how do you bias the picking if you are not at an equal distance to the two sides of the corner?\n\n\nOn a related topic, in the research literature of sampling RBMs using walk on spheres, the recommended approach once a reflective boundary is passed and the process is outside the domain, is to project back to the boundary and continue the process from there. Why is this preferred? Does projection not introduce a bias versus continuing the walk from a reflection inside the domain?",

        "text": "2D vectors and complex numbers seem like two systems for representing a pair of numbers with some meaning (I'm simplifying a bit, but maybe it's okay?).\n\nSo, is there a reason we choose not to define multiplication of vectors (at least in 2D) the same way we define multiplication for complex numbers?\n\nNow, I understand that we have inner products and cross-products for vector fields. But, in 2D, at the very least, vector multiplication could have been defined in the same way as complex number multiplication, where we multiply every component with every other component rather than pair corresponding components as we do in an inner product.\n\nMy guess at the answer is that representing things \"like complex numbers\" in higher dimensions like quaternions, octonions, and sedenions start to break down in terms of what properties they allow (commutativity, associativity, etc.). The geometric interpretation of a plane transform by z that we use when considering complex multiplication like *z\\*(a + ib)* might only be helpful in 2D? So, to avoid that problem, we don't define that kind of multiplication on vectors. Instead, we use inner products that retain their properties for an arbitrary number of dimensions.\n\nFeel free to give rigorous answers/papers which are better than my hand-wavy explanations. Thank you :)\n\nFYI: I work a good bit with vector spaces but not as much with complex spaces, so my understanding of quaternions, octonions, and sedenions isn't robust and could be wrong.",

        "text": "Inspired by the theorems that every natural number is the sums of at most 3 triangles as well as 4 squares, I came up with some problems I found interesting myself, and maybe some of you too.\n\nLet S be a subset of whole numbers so that the difference between two is unique. Can we construct S in a way so that every natural number is the difference of two elements in S? . The following set satisfies the condition for n&lt;14.\nS* ={0,1,3,7,12,20,30,....}\nCan we construct S so that every natural number is the sum of at most 3 elements (not distinct necessarily)?  29 can't be written as the sum of 3 elements in S* for example\n\n\nDoes there exist a subset L of the whole numbers so that every natural number is the unique sum OR difference of two elements. The following set would satisfy this  for n&lt;22. L = {0,1,4,10, 17,29,...}\n\nDoes there exist a subset P of the integers so that every integer can be uniquely written as the sum of two elements. P = {0,2,3,-4,-10,11...} would satisfy this for 4&lt;n&lt;8, but that's the best I came up with. This one seems unlikely to exist  and I guess quite easy  to prove why not.\n\nWould be interested in your thoughts on this!",
