        "text": "When I learned hell doesn’t exist, I gradually became an agnostic atheist. I learned a ton surrounding these words and now use this when a Christian tries to tell me hell or eternal punishment exists. \n\n&gt; shĕ’owl, Geenna/gehenna, Hadēs, Tartaroō, “furnace of fire,” “lake of fire,” “eternal,” “judgment.”\n\nThis is taken from my response to someone earlier, but I thought it interesting to share/discuss:\n\nYou should start with those words, look at each passage that uses these words, and then study the references behind these words/passages. \n\nFor example:\n\nMatt. 5:21-22, specifically, “But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of **hell fire**.”\n\nFollowing later, Matt. 5:29 - “And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and *not that thy whole body should be cast into **hell**.*”\n\nThe original word “hell” in these two passages replaces “gehenna,” which is a transliteration of “ge-Hinnom,” or, fully, “valley of Hinnom”: https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/Dictionary/viewTopic.cfm?topic=IT0003718\n\nThe valley of Hinnom was a place in Jerusalem where dead bodies and trash were thrown or children sacrificed by fire: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna\n\nThis is used figuratively.\n\nThat whole passage’s meaning is a depiction of destroying the *carnal works of the flesh* in this time, not in a literal “hell.” \n\n***\n\nEcclesiastes 9:5 — “For the living know that they shall die: but **the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward**; for the memory of them is forgotten.”\n\n**“neither have they any more a reward”**\n\nThis passage is telling you that it is a *reward* to be dead. Why?\n\nEcclesiastes 9:5-6 — “for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.”\n\nWhen people die it is good because they don’t suffer any more. God doesn’t change this even after Jesus walks and is sacrificed.\n\n** Malachi 3:6 — “For I am the Lord, I change not;” **\n\nDoes it make sense that God would say it is a reward to be dead, then all of a sudden bad people suffer “eternal punishment” after death? How is that a reward? How is this possible if not only God does not change, but his Word explicitly says that to be dead is a reward since they no longer deal with what humans go through while alive?\n\nCan you explain that?\n\n***\n\nWhat do y’all think? Anyone here who was basically only a Christian because they were scared of hell?",

        "text": "Over the last few months I've been having an ongoing discussion with Young-Earth Creationist I know with the goal of changing his mind on evolution and the age of the earth, and if not accomplishing that, at least helping him get to a point where he understands what evolution and natural selection are and could at minimum be informed. At the outset he said that he does value believing true things and that he was interested in having this discussion, though at the end, maybe by my fault, it didn't seem that way.\n\nAlbum [here](https://imgur.com/a/TJWhYHE).\n\nThis is the final discussion period.\n\nWe began with evaluating his arguments for a young earth and intelligent design, but he very quickly became angry when he couldn't provide *any* evidence besides that he couldn't think of any other possibility. I then agreed to be put on the spot and present the evidence for evolution. I answered his questions one-by-one as best as I could, even learning new things in the process, and gave him a package of explanations and evidence for him to look through, this is the package I mention.\n\nI think I did mostly okay, but not great, especially at the end I got frustrated and started to get sloppy. It seems that for most of the conversation he'd make a point, I'd argue against it, he'd ignore me and make another point, I'd argue against it again, he'd ignore me again and make another point, on and on until \"I just don't have the time to look into it.\"\n\nMy own reflection is that next time I need to make sure that both I and my conversation partner really value believing true things, that if evolution were true they would want it proven to them, and continue from there as two people wanting to figure things out, thinking, and being honest and open. Otherwise it's all just a waste of energy.\n\nI'm looking for tips for the next time, or if even having these discussions are pointless, I'm open to hearing that too. I've tried Street Epistemology before but stopped following it rigidly because I felt it was too soft.",

I said that what is this \"souls\" he is talking about and how does he know it exist, he just said that it exist and that it is not false to claim souls exist just because you can't observe or measure them.\n\nHe uses the \"soul\" as a basis that he knows me personally despite rarely meeting me in person and that he prays for me everyday and \"interact to my soul\" through it.\n\nPersonally, what would be your take in this argument?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/8m80en/there_can_be_no_forgiveness_without_cost/",
        "text": "This seems to be the predominant thinking among those apologists who find no fault with there having been required a sacrifice, in Christianity's case being Jesus Christ's death, in order for our sins to be forgiven. \n\nThat raises a few more questions than it answers, if it in fact answers any at all. But what I mainly want to know is why there has to be a cost for forgiveness. If God were omniscient, would he not know when we had the psychological state of true regret? And why does there have to cost involved at all for someone as infinite as God is supposed to be? \n\nAs far as I can tell, the only hypothetical scenario in which this made sense is if you had to *prove* your contrition and regret to the person you did wrong by offering them something that you could have used for yourself instead, and thereby being deprived of that offering, or of the time you had to take out in order to obtain whatever it was you were sacrificing, wherever applicable. It rests on the argument that most people who did not actually care about forgiveness simply wouldn't commit to the effort it required to be forgiven; giving up time and resources. \n\nOnce again, an omniscient god would know whether they were sincere about it, and if they were, the sacrifice would become pointless.\n\nPeople of archaic times made a lot of offerings to their gods, and forgiveness was one of the things they wanted in return. I could be wrong but it seems like this was where the idea of a costly forgiveness comes in because both were about the remission of sins. Is this not one of the reasons Jesus is referred to as 'the lamb'?\n\nI honestly don't see any other reason for there having had to be a sacrifice. By any modern standards, a good father today can forgive his child for a mistake if the child really appeared to be sorry. It's a form of emotional conversation. There is empathy in it. Look up 'reciprocity fallacy' for more information on that. It is ancient thinking and quite telling of how the people around the middle-east thought about moral philosophy two millennia ago, though.\n\nI would love to have my view expanded on this because I feel like I could completely miss something here.\n\n^this is also my first post here hi there :)^",

Like most of you, I see lack of a satisfactory argument as the reason for my atheism. Now why those arguments are not good enough? Because, we would say their premises are not necessarily true. But, when I think or study about philosophy, I notice that we can say, more or less, the same thing for about any type of arguments in the philosophical domain. Even, one can choose to be super-skeptic and deny all arguments for existence of reality and even doubt the scientific findings. \n\nWhat do you guys think about this? Am I too obsessed with skepticism? I'm sometimes afraid that one can be still quite rational and believe in a God at the same time, then some negative thoughts bother me as why I have left theism because of claiming it to be irrational, while it used to give me some comfort and spiritual peace! :(\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your warm comments and useful insights.

        "text": "For background, I'm 20F who grew up in a religious household. I never realized how sheltered my ideas about religion were until I moved away for university. On the outside, I appear to engage in a clusterfuck of contradicting behaviors, but I don't mean to be hypocritical. I'm starting to think it may be a reflection of the internal conflict I feel regarding my beliefs. \n\nYesterday a friend asked me if I believe in a god. I answered with something along the lines of 'i think its plausible but haven't had the time to look into it'. My friend said that I could figure it out if I just spent 30 mins a day looking into it for a few months. Since then my thoughts have been spiraling. Is it really that simple? I'm not a writer by any means but there were just too many thoughts running through my head so I decided to write it out in an essay to recollect them all: \n\nFor now, I’ve decided that I need to take as long as I must before I can conclude on the origin of life. The question of the existence of a god, has been the center of human thought and philosophy since prehistoric times. Deities and divinities can be dated back to upper paleolithic times. It seems presumptuous to believe that I can easily sift through the ideas of peoples that have been circling for almost 1/6th of the time since modern humans evolved. How is it possible for me to answer this question in just a few short months? An answer that may guide the rest of my being and influence the choices I make as long as I continue to live. Until I am satisfied with the knowledge I have on the topic, I will continue to live in a gray, agnostic area, making decisions on the basis of my own discretion and morality which are nonetheless, the result of socialization and ultimately influenced by the religions that surround me. It is a loop that can’t be untied; I will never be truly autonomous in my thoughts and the day of satisfaction may never come. Is that so bad? I feel somewhat content with the way I am living my life within the barricades of how our society functions and I am not in pain knowing that religion, whether or not it is true, and science both contribute to shaping who I am as a person. \n\nWhen I refer to “knowledge” on the subject, I mean with respect to the scientific theories that attempt explain an origin of the earth, the philosophy of religion, and the classic religious ideologies. This seems like a hefty task to perform but I cannot see myself becoming actualized without at least attempting to go through this. It is also possible that my lack of research thus far, has led me to be illusioned into thinking that there is more information out there than there truly is. The definite answer to the question of a higher power is in my opinion, beyond the scope of our current resources and evidence. That’s not to say that we will never know but in my lifetime I doubt that any advances made will significantly carry us forward past philosophical debates. \n\nAnother complexity that has plagued my thoughts is my lack of desire to uncover the truth. A desire that seems to be human nature shared amongst the vast majority of my species. I have come to terms with this lack by rationalizing it through the way our society currently operates. The modern human has an expected contribution to society and the pathway for the average person in most developed and developing countries is predictable. Children go to school and then college where they decide to specialize in a field, and upon entering the workforce they will apply the skills they have learned to continue fostering the productivity of humans on earth. In my own life, I have chosen to pursue a career in medicine. This is the path that I have paved for myself. I take it upon myself to passionately apply myself in this field to make the greatest advancements that will benefit our society. It is what I have resolved to be my duty in the world. Similarly, scholars and scientists who have decided to pursue knowledge on the origin of the world have taken it upon themselves to make advances in this field. Our modern society is based on a foundation that entrusts humans to be competent in their field (I realize this is not always the reality). We trust physicians to perform the most technical surgeries and engineers to build stable bridges, placing our lives in their hands. And when they fail to be diligent, we trust our lawyers and judges to restore justice and order. In the same way people that have not gone through the rigorous medical training cannot be expected to contribute to the advancement of medicine, I do not take it upon myself to worry about what I can do to advance our understanding of the existence of god. That is why I often feel unbothered by not knowing the answer. By choosing to pursue a degree in medicine and not religious studies, I have made no promises to society that I will perform the duty of a scholar. That is a promise made by the scholar and as an untrained member of society with regards to religion, all I can do is trust in their competence to provide the evidence that I can analyze and come to my own conclusion. I do not have the qualifications and means, nor do I have the drive to make my own discoveries. If my desire to uncover the truth was as strong as most people purport theirs to be, I would have chosen to study religion, but the truth is that it is not. That is both the beauty and menace in the modern concept of job specialization.\n\nIn my opinion, atheists who have not examined the evidence and religious people who follow blindly lie in the same category of the masses. On the outside they may appear to be on opposite ends of the spectrum, but I believe they share many underlying characteristics and insecurities. They both have made ill-informed decisions on the origin of life. They both are too arrogant to acknowledge the efforts of scholars and scientists who have dedicated their lives to deciphering records, timelines, accounts, books, languages etc. They both are wasteful of the available resources that are within their reach. They both are too rigid to accept that, in the case of the blind follower – the ideology they have conformed to their entire life may be untrue. And in the case of the uninformed atheist – that there may exist an alternate explanation to life that surpasses their logic and reasoning. Finally, they both are ignorant of the superior role that religion – whether fact or fiction – plays in our society. I think many of them view religion as a true or false, that must be the only way of life for everyone or must be completely eradicated. In reality, it is much more abstract than that. Religion is a social construct, regardless of the extent of its elements of truth, that has significant impacts on the evolution of society.\n\nI find it difficult to fathom how one can be certain of their stance on the origin of life when there are so many factors to consider. I am impressed by people who have done a thorough, exhaustive and in-depth search to find answers and are content with the answer they have chosen. These people are the ones who I think are truly at peace with themselves in their life. They are admirable, and I aspire to be this way. Yet still nothing is absolute. There is too much uncertainty in the universe and gaps in our knowledge. My end goal for this lifetime is to come to a conclusion that is tangible enough to free me of the pestering question that runs through my head every so often about the meaning of life. I believe concluding on such a profound concept will take many years of personal dedication and an openness to ideas presented by specialists and other informed individuals. \n\nIf you took the time to read all of that, thank you I appreciate it, I know I'm not the best at being concise haha. I guess I'm posting this here for multiple reasons: \n\n1. Sharing my ideas and some validation that what I'm saying is not completely incoherent haha \n\n2. Starting a discussion and identifying holes and inconsistencies in my argument for this approach\n\n3. Advice from people feel self-actualized (how did you get there, why do you have your beliefs etc.) \n\n4. Hearing from people who have similar or entirely different views\n\ntl;dr - my views on religion are conflicted and I feel as though I can't be justified in whatever belief I have if it is not accompanied with a copious extent of knowledge on the subject. Therefore, since I have really limited knowledge right now, I don't have an answer for what my 'beliefs' are. How did you approach becoming self-actualized? and does it seem reasonable to require this of myself before committing to a belief? \n",

        "text": "This whole thing is so illogical and it's really been bugging me lately. I often hear religious people say things like \"accepting Christ is not the only way to be saved, one can also be granted access to heaven simply by being a good person.\" Well, I have two major problems with this. First off, doesn't this completely contradict what Christianity is all about? Once the Apple was eaten and humans knew about \"good and evil\", everyone who has ever existed became inherently flawed because we all have this ability to sin. So in a sense, we all have the same evil and compacity to do evil acts within us. \n\nI think when the bible says that \"everyone is created equal\", it's basically saying that everyone is equally fucked up. Therefore, no one can be a better person than someone else. We are all in the same sinking ship together. Gandhi is no better a person than Adolf Hitler, because they are both humans and thus both have the same ability to commit evil acts. Arguing otherwise would suggest that Adolf and Gandhi were not created equal, which goes against what is said in the bible and also makes Christianity unjust and unfair. From my understanding, whether a person becomes a cold blooded murderer or a \"good person\" is determined by their upbringing, the sum of the all experiences they've had, and their genetic makeup. If the circumstances were reversed, Gandhi would've been the mass murderer and Hitler would've been a holy man. Everyone has the same compacity to commit evil, so how could anyone be allowed into heaven without the mercy of God?\n\nMy second problem is how on earth would you decide whether a person has demonstrated enough good deeds to get into heaven? Is there a mystical scale that God uses, where if one person's good deeds outweigh their evil ones then they get to go to heaven? Where exactly would you draw the line? As I stated before, most of the factors involved in determining whether a person will be \"good\" or \"evil\" are put of the person's control (upbringing, genetics etc.). So therefore this judgement process would be completely unfair. The only logical way a person could get into the kingdom of God according to Christianity is through mercy. The whole \"good deeds\" thing becomes increasingly nonsensical the more you think about it. What are your thoughts on this? I'm very open to constructive criticism.",

I thought it would be restful or peaceful, like sleep or going under general anesthesia. A person once expressed to me \"What comes after death is the same as what comes before birth.\" Death seemed inevitable and certain, so why fear it?\n\nRecently though, I got married and started a family. Now I am terrified that, when I die, there will be this \"nothing\" and I will not be with the people I love anymore.\n\nMy view relates to the realisation of death, not the actual death, if that makes sense. I am not scared of physically dying; I am scared sitting here today that one day I will die, and the people I love so much, the family I always dreamt of and finally have, will be gone. I won't see them again, I won't have them to talk to, I won't be able to hug them or kiss them. \n\nIt would be one thing if death was only promised as a peaceful fate when we were all 100 and ready to go, but the reality that life can instantly end for any of us with all of us behind, that doesn't help the fear.\n\nIt probably comes from never having had so much love in my life before. To me, I don't know how people who have always had love and happiness aren't just absolutely petrified of the thought of an existence or \"nothingness\" where one may never be with those that they love ever again.\n\nI have tried delving into religion and spirituality, not so much because I want to believe, but because I want to have some comfort. I've experienced episodes of anxiety when I was a kid and this isn't that irrational type of gripping paralysis. This is just a realisation and a profound unease about the thought that in the \"after-non-life\", I won't have this love or joy. I just wish there was some type of heaven or peaceful place beyond where I could have them with me, instead of just an endless sleep.\n\nHow do you deal with this realisation and accompanying fear?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of the incredibly thoughtful and thought provoking responses that everyone has shared. I have read all of the posts and am writing back replies with as much consideration",

        "text": "Here is my conundrum...\n\nChristians assert that their god is: Perfect, consistent, never changing, non deceptive, error free, not culpable, timeless, always present and all knowing. \n\nHowever to resolve many of the inconsistencies in the bible Christians are willing to accept that any or all of those traits can be fit within a spectrum of lesser to greater degrees of those traits. \n\nSo. If omniscience means that this god is all knowing and timeless(which I assume means that it also knows all the spin speeds of every atom in the universe) then every thought, every action, every prayer, every hope, dream, wish and desire, are already known by this god and free will doesn't exist. \n\nSo how could free will exist if every choice you make, including all your future choices, has been already \"seen\" or \"experienced\" by this god? \n\nHere's some of that inconsistency compensating stuff. According to C.S. Lewis; (paraphrased)\"God is timeless and sees (or experiences) reality in a state of always Now.\" But if this were true then this suggests that this god has no free will either, since it can't change the future, and because it exists, locked in a static state of time that has always existed as is. \n\nLogical leap: Thus if this god gave us free will then this god isn't all knowing. Or if this god, is all knowing, and there is some lesser degree of being stuck in time, then we don't have free will. \n\nYour thoughts....",

        "text": "Leaving my faith, like many people, was an overall shitty experience that I wouldn't wish on anybody.  \n\nBefore I explain, I understand many people here have bad experiences incomparable in magnitude to mine. I'm thankful that mine was a smoother experience, and do feel for those who were hurt (or even disowned) as a result.  \n  \n\nI was relieved to find my fully orthodox Catholic father to maintain his love for me as I left the faith. My mother is not fully invested in Catholicism (thankfully) and understood my reasons for leaving.  \n\nI still enjoy talking to my father about the Catholic faith, Church history, traditions, icons, other religions, etc. It was also to my surprise that we can still discuss our differences and have a (mostly) unheated discussion of our different views.  \n\nHowever, I cannot get over the dogmatism of his views. I have no real problem with his beliefs and opinions. My problem is that those are not beliefs and opinions, but the undeniable truth with nothing under a hundred percent certainty. As a result, it's me getting the CDs and readings to listen to. Maybe if I just listen to *one more* talk on the problem of subjective morality, Darwinism being the \"wrong type\" of evolution due to the lack of intelligent design, I'll finally find what the devil is disallowing me to see.  \n\nIt hurts. I don't try to deconvert him. I mean hell, he wants to help everybody he sees on the street. He's saved so many old little Catholic ladies from buying a new laptop when they get a virus on their computer. He lends his power tools to his neighbor that blunts the shit out of them. When I come home, he's excited to see me and set me up with any food or supplies I need before I head back to my campus. He has his moments with his hard head and defensiveness, but I love my dad.  \n\nThat being said, I'm happy to listen to his audio CDs. I try to break them down and explain to him why I don't see it in the same way. I defend my reasons for leaving and keep it at that. But it seems like it just does not matter. (Many) Christians generally believe that the evidence for their faith surrounds us, and that we can either deny the truth or accept it. There's no \"disagree\" option. If there is, the person obviously hasn't seen x, or doesn't understand y.  \n\nI wish he wasn't led to believe this bullshit, but dogmatism can't leave room for any doubt. I wish he did not worry about my \"state of grace\", whether or not I can enter heaven. If there's one thing I can say I \"hate\" about religion, it's dogmatism. I believe it's the one thing that harms *everybody*, the religious and non-religious. Why should anybody have to suffer the mental torture of seeing their child in intense agony with no relief for eternity, despite the fact that they were honest with themselves and couldn't accept what they were taught? Why should anybody have to suffer that needless brainwashing?  \n\nI understand there are several harms religion has caused us and to minorities since the beginning of history. It harms the ones subscribed to it, too.  \nSorry for the long rant. I have no real conclusion or solution to this, likely because I don't see the obvious proof of every religion's obvious proof. Thanks for reading.  \n\n**EDIT:** Thank you guys a ton for the comments. I've read each and I really appreciate it. I just had to vent somewhere and I feel better about the whole situation. I do appreciate my open dialogue with my dad, but it still does hurt when he worries about the \"state of my soul\". I realize it's something I cannot change him, and his worry shouldn't be at the forefront of my head.",

The conversations go well, but I am in general frustrated by what I feel is condescension. They talk a big game, but it never goes anywhere and it frustrates me. No one sits down and bothers to define what they are talking about. The mainline Christians keep affirming they don’t believe in “that kind of god” whenever I ask for clarifications. For Reform Jews, I usually get “the god of my fathers” like that is supposed to answer anything. All of them seem to think I am not disbelieving in their god the right way, but they can go on for pages and pages of IMs and not actually explain how believing in a god works. They refer to me as a Christian-atheist for some reason. More than anything I am frustrated by this reply. I go through all this trouble to leave a religion, and people still dismiss my concerns as “Christian” and label me “Christian.” \n\nHow am I supposed to respond to this, particularly getting dismissed as a “Christian-atheist”.",

        "text": "As William L. Rowe lays out:\n\n+There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.\n\n+An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.\n\n+(Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.\n\n\nHere,the theist has probably two options:\n\n\n1) He will try to explain every instance of evil by showing how it actually serves a greater good. However this is not easy at all. Rowe gives two examples here,one case is that a fawn is burning in a forest fire,after hours of intense suffering she dies. Another case is an actual event in which a little girl named Sue is killed after being raped by her mother's boyfriend. So here,it is very challenging for the theist to convince us that God has very good reasons to permit these horrible things. Hence,some theists adopt a diffirent approach:\n\n2) Sceptical theism,it basicly claims that we,as humans,have limited capacity so cannot expect to understand and comprehend the unlimited mind and wisdom of an allmighty God. His knowledge is infinite and we cannot understand His reasons with our limited brains. There are greater good in evil things but we cant see them,just as an ameuter chess player cannot understand why Kasparov makes a particular move in the game.\n\n\n\nHere,Rowe objects,that if God wants us to believe in Him,he should at least give us reasons as to why he permits these.Because we dont see any and that makes us doubt his very existence. He behaves \"as if he doesnt exist\". Rowe gives example of parents-child. When a child gets vaccinated,he feels pain but his parents tell him why this happens,how it is for his health etc. so they give reasons for this appearently bad act. God should do so,Rowe implies.\n\n\nAnother objection comes from Graham Oppy,he says that if there are greater good in every instance of evil,then that casts doubt on our understanding of moral responsibilities. If there is a greater good in an evil act we witness,then we should not prevent it from happening because that means we prevent a greater good which only God knows. So then we should not interfere with evil. We should not prevent the gunman from murdering the woman even if we have the chance,which does not make any sense. \n\n\n\nSo,what do you think? \nAtheists,do you think the problem of evil is a powerful weapon against theism? Theists,how do you respond to Rowe's argument? \n\n\nI just very beriefly summarized what I remember about the argument.\nSorry for my poor english and possible misinformation or mispresentation of anything about the arguments.

It’s just so far fetched. \n\nBut the creation of the universe, however it was, seems illogical as well, right? This whole everything coming from nothing. If I were to tell you I had a machine that created a universe you’d surely doubt me. \n\nI think I’m just desperately searching for those answers that no one has. The unsettling feeling that when I die I’ll just be forever lost in the void of nothingness, is constantly in the back of my mind. That feeling you get on a Sunday afternoon, knowing you have 5 days of work coming up but times 1000. \n\nI guess I’m just asking you all if you’ve ever wondered to yourself that because the illogical creation of universe happened, then maybe there’s an illogical afterlife too.

        "text": "So, the Tower of Babel story in [Genesis 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11&amp;version=NIV) is about how mankind all decided to work together to \"build a tower to the heavens\" in order to show how powerful they were. So God, being an all-knowing all-powerful god, decided to confuse everyone so nobody could understand each other and therefore the project failed. And this is supposed to explain why we have so many languages on Earth.\n\nFirst, they were building that tower out of clay bricks. Bricks aren't very strong as a building material, and as such, there's a hard limit on how tall a brick building can be. (The Chrysler Building, if I'm not mistaken, is the tallest one in the world and although it's made of bricks, the scaffolding and machines used to build it were not.) \n\nBut more importantly, *the heavens are way further than a thousand feet up in the air*. If God is all-knowing, he should have known that there was no possible way humans could build a tower \"to the heavens\". If God wanted to stifle human teamwork (which is a terrible idea BTW- he essentially single-handedly caused all of mankind to want to kill each other for the rest of eternity) then what better way than to let them build that tower, and when they spend centuries building and countless lives have been lost in the process and they're only a thousand feet up and the heavens are still just as far away as when they started, they'd probably start fighting amongst themselves and the project would crumble on its own. God didn't have to get involved at all. Physics and human nature would have done all the work for him.\n\nInstead, God comes off as a petty individual who doesn't even understand how his own creation works. Rather than deal with the problem like an intelligent being, he acted like a little child knocking over toys so nobody else can play with them. And people worship this guy.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/8e4gmt/was_paul_the_apostle_a_con_man/",
        "text": "I have always been fascinated by the rift between Paul the Apostle (whose writings and influence created the majority of canonical Christianity) and James the brother of Jesus (whose influence is not nearly as meaningful in canonical Christianity). Paul was a Roman who never met Jesus, and whose job was to persecute early Christians, prior to his supposed conversion while traveling on the road to Damascus (he was on this trip to arrest some early Christians). James was a biological or lawful relative of Jesus (possibly his actual brother) and actually knew the man and his teachings prior to his death. One of these two men would seem to be a much more authentic and accurate source of what Jesus truly said and intended: James. However early Christianity was formed by Paul’s version of the story. Paul’s version of the story also relied much more on the importance of *faith* than the importance of good works. Even today, James is basically ignored and Paul is venerated as one of the greatest saints. \n\nIn other words, a total outsider (and former enemy) of Christians came in and hijacked the entire enterprise. One must wonder, was Paul—a Roman who profited from persecuting Christians prior to his supposed conversion—simply a con man? Isn’t it likely that this total outsider realized he could exploit the group he was tasked with persecuting, knowing he could have more influence this way? Wouldn’t it make sense for this man (whose works included arresting Christians) to change rules so that works mattered less than *belief*?\n\nFurthermore, why do you think James’s side of the story has been all but ignored in Christianity?",

        "text": "This is the first post I submit to this sub and to Reddit, so I hope I'm doing this right.\n\nI've been noticing this pattern for years now. Whenever I see any discussion happening between an atheist and a religious, it always boils down to the word religious people probably hate most when discussing with atheists: \"Evidence\". One side seeks for evidence while the other side can't provide any. I'll give a very, **very** simple example of this happening with a chat between a Christian and an atheist. For purposes of making both easier to identify, the Christian will be a woman and the atheist will be a man. \n\nLet's say there was a natural disaster somewhere, and a week after the incident, there were official reports about how a lot of people managed to escape it with no harm. A Christian, somewhere, gets note of this and starts talking about how prayers are effective and how they're a way of God displaying his presence and eternal love. She speaks in a way as if the amount of prayers had a direct influence on how many people were saved from the disaster. An atheist passes by and asks the Christian what evidence does she have to support the claim that prayers are indeed effective. The Christian, somewhat shocked that someone is doubting something that to her eyes is so *obvious*, doesn't explicitly say she has none, but instead, goes on a talk/ramble about how the atheist needs to accept God's love into his life and Jesus as his saviour. Somewhere in the middle of the preach reply, she says he cannot prove that prayers are not effective. The atheist then explains that he never *claimed* prayers were not effective, but is simply skeptic of the claim of how prayers *are* effective. He then proceeds to say that since she's the one holding onto that claim, she cannot swap the burden of proof to make the opposing side disprove anything, as it falls under the Christian alone to provide the necessary evidence to support the prayer effectiveness claim.\n\nThe conversation then goes on, but we already have all the pieces on the board settled about the topic this thread is about. Evidence versus Not Evidence. On one side we have someone asking for evidence, and at the other side we have someone who doesn't care for not having it. The atheist is asking for something the Christian can never provide, and the Christian is giving an explanation that the atheist can never accept.\n\nThe conversation cannot find a starting position because both of them are talking about different things. It's like two people talking in two completely different languages trying to find a common ground that they can both agree on so the talk can proceed. It just doesn't happen, which is why in conversations like these, the topic doesn't lift off. Both sides point out the reasoning errors of the opposite side, based on their own point of view, and the conversation ultimately leads to nowhere. That's how I see it as an atheist myelf. Please give me your thoughts.",

        "text": "I'm an ex-Muslim, and I've never been religious, but I became a full fledged atheist by the time I was 14. I grew up in Bangladesh. I never had a problem with my friends knowing that I was atheist. Nobody ever wanted to kill me (things are a lot different now). Most people would find it interesting that I was an atheist, and would argue religion with me. My classmates would argue with me constantly about different religious things, and they all thought I was going to hell. But they're still some of my best friends to this day. (Today I think the situation is different, because some teenager goes on facebook and declares to the world that he's an atheist. And some crazy nut, from some other town, who doesn't know this atheist personally, and has no relationship with this person, decides to get angry, and decides to avenge his god. Being an atheist was a lot safer when I was growing up in the late 80s.).\n\nWhen I came to the US, and my American friends first found out that I was an atheist, their arguments with me were of a different nature to what I'd been used to. They'd say \"How can you be so arrogant, as to think that you could be in the Universe without a God?\" or \"Don't you want to go to heaven?\" \n\nSome well meaning Christian friends would see an opportunity and start telling me about how Jesus died on the cross for me. But nobody ever rejected my friendship over atheism. So as an atheist, I’ve always been comfortable in my skin. My father was happy that I turned into an atheist. My mother stopped engaging me, because she thought that every conversation with me on the subject would end up with me saying something blasphemous, something so bad, that she’d rather I say nothing at all on the subject.\n\nSo personally, atheism has never really been a social problem for me. But every time I watch The Atheist Experience, I’m shocked at how many people call in about their problems with their families rejecting them. It’s heartbreaking. And it’s something that I almost can’t imagine. \nSo I thought of writing something for Atheists that were having problems with their families, something they could just hand to their family members to read, that would explain how atheists think. If they could understand how many of us think, maybe they’d appreciate the non-belief. \nFor instance, I think it’s more arrogant to think that the creator of the Universe thinks about me, than to think that there’s no creator of the Universe. \nI think it’s an unconscionable idea to think for one second that I could enjoy myself in heaven, knowing that there are people languishing in hell.\nI think the idea of heaven in Abrahamic faiths is extremely ill-defined. If you ask three questions about what the hell goes on in heaven on a day to day basis, every Christian or Muslim I’ve ever met is dumbfounded. They have no idea what goes on in heaven. There’s no detail.\nAlso, if there really is a God, the idea that this being is interested in me and my thoughts and my hopes and dreams, when he has the whole universe, and possibly other universes to think about, is preposterous.\n\nSo I put these ideas in a short play, about an Atheist who dies and discovers that there is an afterlife. He is given the choice to go to heaven. But he starts asking questions about what goes on in heaven. He asks about hell, and after some deliberation decides to go to hell instead. He can’t live with the idea of enjoying himself, when he doesn’t know if he’ll ever be joined there by his son and wife. The idea of being in heaven, while they might end up in hell is too much for him and he chooses to go to hell.\nNow of course, as we all know, there is no afterlife. So he experiences this dialog in his head, as he is dying. The White Light effect.\nSo I wrote this play specifically for Atheists having difficulty explaining their thought processes and dispositions to their family members. If these friends and family members read it, I think they’d understand Atheists better.\nWhile I did get the permission from the moderators to post my link to my play (It’s FREE), I have a feeling that some of you might find it to be spam. So if anybody is interested in it, please message me and I’ll send you a download link. And if anybody wants me to post the link on this discussion, I’d be more than happy to do so.\nThanks so much for reading.\nAveek\n\nEdit (Download Link): https://www.pdf-archive.com/2018/04/18/interchange-station-pdf-free/\n",

After watching a video that a friend of mine sent me of Lee Strobel, he argued that DNA is evidence of god because it encodes so much information about an organism. We can look at DNA and tell whether or not a person has blue eyes, for example, without even looking at him, so it really does seem like an \"information system.\" He also said that something like a message with information from space would certainly lead us to believe in an intelligence that sent the information, and DNA is essentially information. So, I'm a bit troubled because I'm not quite sure why DNA is not evidence of god. Furthermore, it is often said it biology textbooks that DNA is \"read\" then \"copied,\" as if it is an instruction manual. Like, how else would something like that be able to have arisen naturally? Even though there are FAR too many reasons why I don't believe in god, this one argument is giving me a bit of trouble.\n\nP.S.

        "text": "Hello! In /r/DebateAChristian during a discussion with a Christian regarding the below passage, I stumbled upon an interesting and fairly solid (in my opinion) logical argument I would like to share. For context I would like to relate the following passage from the Old Testament:\n\n&gt;\"If any man takes a wife and goes in to her and then hates her and accuses her of misconduct and brings a bad name upon her, saying, ‘I took this woman, and when I came near her, I did not find in her evidence of virginity,’ then the father of the young woman and her mother shall take and bring out the evidence of her virginity to the elders of the city in the gate. [...] But if the thing is true, that evidence of virginity was not found in the young woman, then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones\" - Deuteronomy 22:13-21\n\nThe main takeaway from this passage, in my opinion, is that in it the Bible explains that beating a human to death with stones is an acceptable punishment for premarital sex. With this in mind, we can construct a three-part logical argument using this and other edicts of the Christian faith:\n\n1. God is omniscient, and an omniscient being cannot know something to be good when it is actually evil, or know something to be true that is actually false.\n\n2. The Bible is the perfect word of God as written.\n\n3. Therefore the Bible must be both \"true and good\" as written. Otherwise, either God is wrong, he is lying, or he is evil. The former is impossible from 1. and both the latter options mean he is malevolent and not worthy of our respect or devotion.\n\nFrom this argument we can only draw four logical conclusions:\n\n1. God is not omniscient,\n\n2. God is malevolent, \n\n3. Stoning women for having premarital sex is good, or \n\n4. The Bible is not the perfect word of God.\n\nIf 1, there is no way to claim God's morality is the unambiguous truth of human nature. In this case, God is no more the ultimate arbiter of human morality as Aristotle or any other mortal philosopher was or is. If 2, God is a deceiver and a false idol who should not be followed. 3 is obviously false and if anybody claims otherwise they are a fairly objectively evil person. If 4, all of Christianity may be thrown into doubt as we have no way of knowing what parts of the Bible are the perfect word of God and which are just the interjections of human moralists.\n\nI don't think there are any other conclusions that can be logically drawn from the 3 postulates, which themselves are, in my opinion, well-established fundamental Christian beliefs. Obviously the correct conclusion is 4 as we all know the Bible is not the work of a supernatural deity but of human religious leaders, but that throws all of Christianity to the wind logically speaking since if the Bible is not perfect there really isn't a way to differentiate what is God-breathed and what is human intervention. So 1, 2, and 4 would all be *huge* flaws in the Christian worldview, which leaves the devout Christian only option 3, which is clearly evil and something that would immediately alienate the whole world against Christianity if implemented.\n\nIf there's any flaw in my logic or anything anybody would like to add, I'd love to hear it!",

        "text": "The context of my subject:\n\nThere is a history that is not told in public school. From the 4th to the 16th century governments and religious christian institutions were intertwined and each used as a tool of the other to control a generally ignorant population and gain wealth and power.  By  the 7th century this was true of Islamic countries as well. \n\nThe American separation of church and state was recognition of the problem of mixing religion and politics but it did not stop them from using religion to help subdue the indians in the American west.  See: The Gods of Indian Country by Jennifer Graber.  More and more it is used today by political organizations inside America to gain power and wealth and by outside governments trying to divide her and gain power and wealth.\n\nIt is possible for religion and atheism to live side by side in peace but probably only if neither side actively tries to convert the other.  I know this because my wife is very religious (she doesn't call it that) and I have been an atheist my entire adult life (I'll be 70 this year)\n\nSo, I would never suggest trying to convert those who have relied on religion and for whom it plays a major role in who they are. If it could be done (doubtful) it would destroy them.\n\nI think though that the world would be a better place with more ethical atheists and less religion.   There are far too many forces with vested interests using religion to gain wealth and power for that to occur naturally (just as it was used in the middle ages).\n\nI see the FFRF as an important organization trying to hold the line to at least not make things worse.\n\nBeyond that, and considering the above how can conversions to atheism be accelerated? \n\n",

For example, when we talk about thunder. Thunder in Islam, according to a saying by Muhammad, occurs when an angel whips the clouds with his stick. My mother thinks also that gravity is some kind of devil play, a devil pulls the things downwards -_- I try to explain this with science, and I try hard :/ but she just can't get it and say: How come you be so sure that there are no angels that whip the clouds and consequently thunder happens or devils that pull stuff down -_-\n\nSo here comes my question: Her reactions and arguments really piss me off but I don't show it.

        "text": "Ok guys. So if you have seen my past posts I came out as a heretic to my family and have been dealing with the shitstorm ever since.  While I haven't suffered abuse like some of you unfortunately may have,  I have been subjected to forced church attendance, various religious rants AKA forced sermons, and massive guilt tripping since I was a premature baby and thus was a miracle (my mother lost several babies before). But never mind the hundreds of thousands of stillborn babies, starving children in Africa, child brides in the Middle East and so on. I'm just that special. \n\n\nMy mother also said God would make me see that I need him, and this honestly believe it or not scared me a bit. And when I was watching Lefend Of Korra (An anime fantasy series by Nick heavily influenced by Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies and part of what sparked my interest in such) awhile ago, she said that's what made me be Buddhist (which is true to an extent, but of course more guilt tripping).\n\n\nBefore I mentioned our great aunt preaching to us. OH. MY. GOD it was horrible.  I shit you not she was on my sister for at least 1 1/2 and 2 hours and accused her of being disrespectful for not wanting to sit there and listen to this bullshit(very old fashioned)\n\n\nHonestly,  what makes this hard for me is I haven't had very many friends throughout my life. Imhave Asperger's and have thus been socially awkward, done some things I regret and have felt empty just feeling life pass me by. Also I'm atill struggling a bit regarding thoughts of death (not suicidal) and whether there is an afterlife. \n\n\nBut ever since I have been getting more into things like Buddhism and philosophy and science,  I feel a bit better as I have something else I can follow spiritually but is more grounded in reality. And after ditching the homophobia of Christianity (never hated gays, but disapproved of it when I was a believer) I can even enjoy my favorite animes and shows since alot of the popular ships are LGBT. I want to meet other fanboys nerds, and so alot of my future closeset friends, coworkers, etc will likely be LGBT which is fine by me.\n\n\nThe problem though is if my own parents(see my past posts)  are so homophobic I can't see myself having much of a connection with them. My parents say things about gays that if they were talking about any other group the bigotry becomes evident.  Here's a sample, though imagine black instead of gay:\n\n\n\"I have gay friends, (insert prejudiced comment)\"\n\n\n\"A gay man won't get much of a conversation from me. They also shouldn't have kids so they won't be exposed to that lifestyle\"\n\n\n\n\"If my grandkids are gay that would be a burden and disappointment on my heart\"\n\n\n\"I would be heartbroken if my kids were gay\"\n\n\n\"Gays having sex is like humans sleeping with animals\"\n\n\n\n\"At least my kids aren't \"confused\" like so and so.\"\n\n\nI think you get the idea. Plus when I confessed my apostasy the first thing they asked after was if I was gay (I'm straight) as if that was the next worst thing. Also my intended major is biology,  and so I really am getting more into science. But with religious family, Genesis takes presidence over evolution. And since I would be studying biology evolution is the basis of that and thus why I am strongly opposed to creationism and overall stifling of scientific progress.  My family and I are basically on opposite sides of this.\n\n\nBottom line, I'm someone who supports equality for all and is openminded but thinks critically.  I want to get involved in activism for LGBT rights, secular student stuff, and of course Buddhism and science advocacy.  And this is where having a relationship with my folks doesn't seem tangible.  We couldn't have a conversation of any true substance, asking advice on things like loss and hard times is also out since they would invoke the \"It's part of God's plan\" shit. And the fact that they would be disappointed by gay grandkids is a real head shaker. And as far as dating goes, I would date a girl who is bisexual as long as she met my critieria for a girlfriend, [but oh boy they would not approve if I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/7ycpy3/my_sister_has_a_bisexual_boyfriend_and_my/)\n\n\nI've applied to take out a loan for college.  Though I still need a money security deposit from my mother for dorms. I'm trying to keep this on the down low. Hopefully I can pull off, but if anyone else pulled the plug on their parents for similar reasons, your advice and experience is appreciated.\n\n",

        "text": "I used to accept this viewpoint hook, line and sinker but I am hating the idea of it more and more lately, and I am increasingly more hostile to this idea that sounds good on the surface but falls apart the more you examine it. I used to think like this and thought the new age god was better than the Christian due to the lack of new age belief in an eternal hell.\n\nHowever, I now think that the new age god has similar problems to the Christian one, and cannot really be that loving either. Evolution on its face is evil (yep I dare to use that term here) and I am having a hard time believing that any kind of good gods or spiritual forces would have created such a thing. \n\nAlso, bad people on earth often get away with evil unpunished, so is the great lesson to be learned on earth is that evil works and justice doesn’t matter?! How does painful and horrific childhood cancer benefit any child spiritually? Concerning reincarnation we remember nothing, so how are these so called lessons actually making us grow spiritually when we cannot access them in this life?\n\nI am thinking if the new age god exists, it too is evil and a liar just like the Christian one and unworthy of being listened to let alone obeyed in order to incarnate on earth. So you need to eat poop to appreciate a rose garden? What crap! I found a user on a skeptical forum who gave an annoying new age user a great refutation of the “we must suffer on earth to grow spiritually” teaching:\n\nMara:\n\n“‘Need’ for what? \n\nIf you worked in the jobs I have (child protection, domestic and family violence, elder abuse, homelessness, severe disability, poverty etc.) The vail of illusion that there is any learning in difficulty would very quickly drop. TRUST ME. \n\nThe only people who propagate your understanding are those who spend their entire lives hiding from the actual reality, which is most of the people in developed nations btw. Do you think this kid was in need of learning a ‘valuable lesson’ ?\n\nhttp://100photos.time.com/photos/kevin-carter-starving-child-vulture \n\nLife is fundamentally sh*te, some get lucky to not notice it, and then we die. The end. Leave the lucky kids to be lucky, the issue is not in their abundance of luck but the fact that others don’t get to enjoy as much luck.\n\nThat’s why science and rational thinking is SO IMPORTANT to protect the most vulnerable from those who are conveniently full of grandeur delusions and ignorance of own privileges. \n\nWhen you support victims of trauma the first step is to acknowledge their sense of injustice and unfairness, otherwise you cause further harm, further disossiations. \n\nYou let them express the anger and the disappointment with the world, with the existence, with their family who brought them to this world without having much to offer, with the systems that failed them in delivering to what they supose to, THEN when they are ready, you start to help them to move on by closing one chapter and opening another - that is providing they are still alive and cognitively able. \n\nAt no point you try to brainwash them that what happened to them needed to happen or was beneficial in any way. People are nowhere near to that stupid, it’s 2018 not 15th century. \n\nHuman beings (and animals for that matter) learn through observation and experience. In order to have healthier and ‘better’ people they need to be first given a healthy and positive experience - there is no other way. \n\nI will leave you with this (in the context of your beliefs replace religion with ‘spirituality’)\n\n“Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. \n\nReligion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d'honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realisation of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.\n\nReligious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\n\nThe abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.”\n\nMara’s posts are wonderful and would be worthy of reddit gold if she were a reddit user and I the money to give her. I think the whole 6 pages are worth reading if anyone has the time. She hit upon some of the things I have been feeling lately.\n\nhttp://www.skepticforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=22352&amp;sid=3a7b054d3fdad527235d8f0d826e5e25\n\nI need to get these thoughts off my chest. Part of me wants to dump all ideas of the new age and embrace atheism full stop due in part to the thoughts I gave above. Does anyone else have more philosophical ideas against the new age rather than just the lack of evidence and it’s overall fraudulent nature? Thank you!\n\n",
