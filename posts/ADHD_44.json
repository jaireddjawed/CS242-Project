I‚Äôve been majorly depressed the past 1.5-2 years and chalked up hours and hours of un productivity and laziness up to that‚Ä¶.but now that things are looking up I just can‚Äôt come to any other conclusion other than this. Hours upon hours spent in the library either snoozing away, on my phone, or just staring into space. Just came out of a 6 hour study session of doing jack shit. I couldn‚Äôt tell you where the time goes. Angry passive aggressive comments from friends and family about how I‚Äôm late to literally everything no matter how hard I try. I couldn‚Äôt tell you where the time goes. Weeks of ghosting people, weeks of not seeing people to ‚Äúget work done‚Äù and in the end I can‚Äôt bring myself to relax, or to do work. Just nothingness. Spending 30 minutes just to get up and brush my teeth while everyone else spends 10 or less. Spending hours and hours on an assignment, or studying in general, or chores, for everyone else to do it in half the time. Not showering for days, not because I‚Äôm lazy (well, the depression is PART of it) but because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time.‚Äù Dressing like a skin because I don‚Äôt have time to look presentable or to get a new style. And I‚Äôm still exhausted. All of this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I chalked up to a lack of discipline. I just need to try harder, spend more time ‚Äústudying,‚Äù you just take longer than other people it‚Äôs okay just work with it. Why don‚Äôt you join clubs they say. Work out? Go party? I don‚Äôt have time! I‚Äôm just different from everyone else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nWell honestly I‚Äôm tired of it. Tired of being mediocre at everything‚Ä¶.at putting in thrice the effort but seeing half the results compared to others. I hate to chalk it up to adhd because I feel like everyone else says they have it and it‚Äôs quite annoying‚Ä¶but what other explanation is there??? I can‚Äôt keep doing this man. How will I make space for other things in my life if every waking second is spent in vain??? Why can everyone else do things I can‚Äôt???\n\nIn conclusion: I‚Äôve scheduled an evaluation in 2 days :). Any tips, suggestions, etc on time management would be immensely helpful. And yes, I‚Äôve tried planners, time blocking, etc. Everything. The one thing that seems to work is staying away from my phone and getting in the habit of moving around but still.",

I have struggled with my mental health my whole life but the last 8 months have been an all time low. Over the last 8 months I have experienced a lot of anxiety, anxiety attacks, suicidal thoughts, depression, meltdowns, inability to sleep, not feeling like my self, and just feeling like my life/problems are bigger than mine. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, and anxiety. \n\nMuch of this has to do with my job. Most of my life I have been very type A, gunner, and have accomplished most things I have wanted. I got my first corporate accounting job and in the first six months I excelled. Then our company went through a ton of changes in July of 2022 and it resulted in me having a large workload (at one point I was trying to do like 4 people's jobs) without a ton of experience. \n\nIn the recent months my job has started to become better with more people being hired. I have also made steps to help my mental health (mainly getting a great therapist that I have been going to consistently for one year.) I have tried medication 3 times and have seen some benefit but have struggled to take it consistently. With all of these improvements I still struggle with stress, feeling like my problems are bigger than me, not feeling like myself, anxiety attacks, nightmares, and anxiety related to my job. My job is still demanding (I can't remember the last time I worked 40 hours)\n\nI have been able to be open with my boss with my struggles and he has been very supportive. **I am thinking though about quitting my job and looking for something that is less stressful/demanding even though it will pay less. I worry though that I am the problem that I will go to another job and continue to struggle.** I also struggle to know what to do I am kind of burnt out from accounting and want to do something else. The main thing I am wanting from a job is low stress, good work life balance, and good boss/team\n\nAny advice? (also feel free to give any other advice that has helped yall with your mental health)\n\nThanks for giving me a place to talk :)",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nIt's been really difficult for me to memorize the piano pieces. I remember when I was a kid, I prepared for some piano performance examinations(also some competitions) every summer, and I could learn 3 pieces in 1 month but I needed to spend more than 3 months memorizing them. For most other kids, it may take them 2 months to study and then another 2 months to perfect and memorize the pieces. Other than those complete piano pieces (usually classical ones), during the exams, the candidates have to play 1-2 piano scales based on the name of the scales( E major, d minor, for example). For me, it was almost impossible to know which scale should I play, because I had no idea what A/B/C meant and no idea when I should play a sharp/flat note; it was just not possible for me to learn the rules and the theoretical part of classical music. \n\nI stopped playing the piano after passing the highest level for amateurs (around 11) and then started to practice and take lessons again in college. I tried to learn music theory and memorize the pieces I'd been practicing for months, but I wasn't successful. Currently, I'm still waiting for my diagnosis (my doctor needs some time, but I did terribly in the CPT test and she basically said it's very likely, even though not 100%, for me to get that ADHD diagnosis), but I don't know if not being able to memorize piano pieces/music theory are signs of ADHD?\n\n I also listen to classical music a lot, and I'm always shocked by the fact that many people (a whole bunch of concert pianists and piano performance students--I mean those concert pianists may be geniuses who are extremely good at memorizing, but what about those conservatory students around the world? over 100K memory geniuses every year?) are able to memorize those piano concertos, sonatas, fugues, etudes, etc.. many elite pianists can perform 3-4 long pieces in a 2-hr concerto; I only know one elite pianist (Pogorelich) who regularly uses his music notes during recitals, but he was able to perform a dozen different pieces (from Scarlatti to Scriabin to Liszt) without the notes in one recital for 2 hours when he was young. Many conductors also do not use the notes when they are performing--symphony performances usually last for over an hour.\n\nIt would literally take me 3 months to memorize a 3-min etude.\n\nDo you think my inability to memorize the pieces is ADHD-related? Can things be better if I'm on meds?",

Since then I have listened to many audio-books. But reading physical/digital books started to become a struggle for me sometime around 2009. I was 38 and had trouble reading a Dan Brown novel, which, if you've ever read them, are \"quick reads.\" I didn't know at the time that I was dealing with ADHD. After some searching through my library, I think the last physical book I read was Dust by Hugh Howey. I'm so glad we have audio-books and would likely be listening to more, but I don't commute anymore since COVID, so I find myself not reading/listening to anything now.\n\nSo, now that I have a name for the thing that was keeping me from reading, I'd like to dip my toes back into the water.\n\nMy first book will be Voltaire's Candide. It's short, about 100 pages, I read it back in maybe 1990. I really liked it and want to read more books like it.\n\nSo, does anyone have any suggestions for stimulating books for someone who hasn't picked up a book in 10 years? I'd like to start small, with novellas, short stories, etc, but any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "Ok so this is something I've noticed works super well for me and I figured I'd share to see if it can help anyone else!\n\nSo I'm a college student and around finals time last semester, I was really struggling to keep track of all of my assignments and make sure I got everything done. So I created a sticky note wall! Here's how it works!\n\n**1. Figure out your tasks and a time frame to do them in.**\nI find that this tends to work best for weekly to do lists so I can choose x amount of tasks per day, but if you have a lot to do in one day you could try to do x per hour instead.\n\n**2. Sort your tasks into categories.**\nMy current categories are academic tasks, chores, and other, but you can have as many or as few categories as you want. I do recommend having at least two though so you can differentiate between which tasks will require mental energy and which will require physical energy.\n\n**3. Write all of your tasks on sticky notes.**\nIf you can, try to color code them. Each category gets a different color sticky note. If you only have one color of sticky note, try writing the different categories in different colored pens. Just try to make the categories visibly distinguishable.\n\n**4. Stick them all on a wall somewhere!**\nMake sure it's somewhere you look at often. Mine is on the wall above my computer. I also recommend arranging them kinda randomly, scattering the categories within one another and not trying to make them very nice and neat (if you can handle that. I know that bothers some people). The wilder it looks, the more it draws your attention and the more often you'll remember to look at it.\n\n**5. Divide your number of tasks by the time period you need to achieve them in.**\nThis is how many you will need to do per day (or hour or whatever else you are using). For example, if you have 12 tasks to complete in 6 days, you would need to do 2 tasks a day. If you have 15 tasks to complete in 5 hours, you would need to do 3 tasks per hour. If you can do more, great! But you don't have to! Make sure you understand your bare minimum.\n\nI also think a good thing to note here is to round up not down. For example. I want to complete my 18 tasks in 5 days. So I'm rounding up to 4 per day instead of down to 3 per day because then I'd have a whole extra day of tasks to do at the end.\n\nAnd finally...\n\n**6. Start doing tasks!**\nThis organizational method not only helps you to better visualize your tasks and manage your time, but it's also super mega ADHD friendly! Why you may ask? Many reasons, but not the least of which is that as you complete tasks *you get to pull the sticky notes off the wall and throw them away.* This is an immediate dopamine hit and I personally find it to be more satisfying and motivating than crossing things off a list.\n\nI'll post a link to a photo of my wall in the comments (imgur is taking forever to load and I wanna post this before I forget).\n\nNot sure this will work for everyone, but it works really well for me so I wanted to share so that hopefully someone who it will help will stumble across this post. If you end up trying it, I'd love to hear what you think!",

To back up my suspicions, all of my school reports say the same from Kindergarten to Year 12: \n\n‚ÄúHorny4Houli has bad behaviour issues.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIs lazy and inattentive, would rather entertain other students.‚Äù\n‚ÄúEither fully applies himself to a project and creates great work or doesn‚Äôt care at all.‚Äù\n‚ÄúStares out of the window, daydreaming.‚Äù\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt focus. Behind in his studies.‚Äù\n‚ÄúClass clown.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHe is smart with a lot of potential, but ‚Äòchooses‚Äô to distract himself and others and doesn‚Äôt apply himself.‚Äù\n\nEtc etc‚Ä¶\n\nI have had like 15-20 jobs in my life, I get lots of warnings about my tardiness and struggle to cope with the multi-tasking &amp; external stimuli at work without getting overly angry and snapping. Have felt like an alien forever. Problem child is how I‚Äôve felt and labelled since day one. Video games and playing guitar can eat all my time away, it‚Äôs extremely hard for me to remove myself from those two things (as well as my phone 8 hours a day) even though a lot of important, pressing admin tasks in my life are left neglected. It feels so safe and relieving to dive into those things for hours at a time until I fall asleep. And I‚Äôm bloody damn good at the things I apply my focus/interest on too, really good at them. When people are talking to me, I sometimes have to use every ounce of mind strength to focus and hear everything people are saying without being distracted or hearing nothing at all. When a few hours of conversation has passed, I‚Äôm tired and need time to recharge somehow.\n\nThe list goes on‚Ä¶ So why do I feel like I‚Äôm a fraud? An imposter? That I actually just have anxiety and depression issues? I swear I‚Äôve been doing all the mental-health work that I‚Äôve needed to for well over a decade, and it‚Äôs nothing but a Band-Aid. All the symptoms come back again like clockwork and I have to start the work and mental effort again. It‚Äôs overwhelmingly a feeling of wanting to achieve SO MUCH but being trapped in a cage and I can‚Äôt move. Feeling like everyone hates me and talks about me behind my back. Highly sensitive, highly empathetic. It‚Äôs exhausting. \n\nWould love some words of encouragement, for someone who is undiagnosed and waiting to be assessed in a few months. What did you do to maintain hope and not convince yourself it‚Äôs all in your head? \n\nSincerely,\nMe.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- Friends and family deterring me from thinking I have ADHD. I have had obvious symptoms since I was old enough to speak, but feel like I‚Äôm an imposter even though I feel like there‚Äôs been a war going on inside my head and body every day since I was little. Spent my whole life ‚Äòkeeping up‚Äô and always behind in life. Would love some words of encouragement because I feel like I can‚Äôt keep up and I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôve finally found the answer to all of my problems.",

And I suffer from GAD. After a couple of years of bedside nursing, I realized it's not for me. Too much social interaction, responsibility and stress. Nursing is great job- it's just not for me.  I also looked into different outpatient jobs and just realized that I don't want to really work with patient's anymore. But the only other nursing jobs i see are desk jobs and a lotttttt of reading (like health records and stuff). I actually want to leave the field.\n\n TBH guys- I went into nursing because of pressure from those around me. I do a good job at my job (although it kills me mentally and physically lol), but I feel like this is the first time in my life that I'm finally asking myself of what *I* like and what *I* want to do. It feels liberating but also scary because I like/dislike so many things. \n\nI've been thinking about going back to school. I like music, animals and food! But I don't really know what to make of those things. I would like a stable, safe job but I know that I can't have it all. Dream jobs are hard to come by.\n\nI like fast paced environment, but not chaotic. I like to be autonomous when I know what I'm doing. Tasks are super cool, just not all at once. I like the feeling of being productive! And I like to learn new things that interest me...cause if it's not I zoning out.\n\nOriginally this was gonna be a \"any suggestions?\" post which I'm still open to, but I guess I just needed to get it off my chest as well.\n\nThanks for reading.

        "text": "So I was doing some research on how neurotypical people think because I found myself asking friends and family similar questions. Such as, ‚ÄúHow do you guys not get burnt out?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do you wake up in the morning?‚Äù They seem like pretty basic questions but ofc from my standpoint and theirs, our ways of thinking are different. They would respond with how difficult it is for them but they just ‚Äúdo it‚Äù cause they have to. Then of course the occasional relatable joking around where they say they want to quit or whatever. For me though, I understand that we have to do things because we have to- but the mental pressure is so much draining because of the ADHD that I would require hospitalization. Being so self-aware hurts my mental health so badly to the point that it affects my physical well-being. \n\nSo, I decided to do some extra research on neurotypical behaviors in order to see if I can improve my own mentality. The main idea that I took away was that neurotypical individuals are able to do their tasks every day because they can focus on the end goal. And the chemicals in their brains are balanced enough. However, because of the chemical imbalance in individuals with ADHD, the ‚Äúend goal‚Äù is not enough because we need instant gratification. Therefore this leads to extra pressure and anxiety problems. \n\nI am aware of this so I try to change my thinking patterns but am struggling. \n\nFor example, I will work on a class where I‚Äôm behind on with notes and assignments. The assignments are more important and must be done first. I can simply look at the slides to review the notes I missed and then work on turning in the assignments first. But, my brain wants to do things ‚Äúin order‚Äù and I make it harder on myself. I want to work on writing down ALL the notes I missed first before working on the assignments because it just feels right. But when I do that, I burn myself out and end up getting less important work done and falling more behind. I know what I should be prioritizing but it hurts my head to change how I think. \n\nOr, when I‚Äôm copying down notes, I prefer to type them all out instead of easily copying and pasting them. I know it‚Äôs easier to do that but for me- in order to ‚Äúfocus‚Äù I need to do it my own way. I hate that I do this to myself. \n\nDo you guys have tips on how to change your mindset?",

I‚Äôve been trying to make new friends as I‚Äôve been very depressed and having a ton of anxiety I find that talking is my cope. I try my very hardest to make friends and bond with people so I try to talk. Some people find it very annoying they cover it up with ‚Äú0oh you have a nice personality but your hearing you talk give me a tumor‚Äù I obviously take this as a joke as it is a joke. But I want to better my self and try to not talk as much. I‚Äôm very hyper active with my ADHD. I‚Äôve been on several medicines my entire life, some even make me calm down and not talk as much but I feel like that‚Äôs not me and people start to say ‚Äúoh you‚Äôve been quite‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how to cope with this, as I feel like I wanna be my self. I like being my self but people obviously don‚Äôt like being around me only a select few of my irl friends have wanted to hear what I have to say about my day or even about my school. I‚Äôm currently in college im going for a bio degree but I feel like some people just don‚Äôt like me and I want to see how other people cope with this and if others with adhd experience this aswell. ( sorry for the bad grammar) I just want to talk to people that are actually wanting to talk but it‚Äôs super hard to fit in. \n\nMy first solution imo is getting a therapist but that‚Äôs currently the only solution.\n(Sorry if it‚Äôs all over the place)",

        "text": "Hello, im an AFAB, agender person with ADHD. And i've been struggling with my periods honestly for generations now, and i honestly just want them to stop. \n\n\nEvery month for about a week (maybe two) period has been ruining my life.  I become very depressed and all i can do is just lay in bed and cry. It also makes my ADHD symptoms worse! And i can't do anything about it! I hate the pain, i hate the mood swings i hate that it affects me in any way at all. I want it to stop.\n\n\nIm genually considering getting surgery to remove my uterus  and ovaries and then talking estrogen. But i am afraid that it won't solve my problem and will just leave my body with irreversable damage and that i might regret it later.\n\nAlso i definetly don't wanna go on testosterone cause i love how my body looks and i definitely don't want it to change.\n\n\nIm also considering going on the birth control cause that stops periods as well and i can go off it any time. But im unsure what the side effects would be or if it would even help. Im kinda afraid that it might affect my adhd for the worse.\n\n\nIm also currently not on any ADHD medication, but i am considering it. If that's relevant.\n\n\n\nHonestly, to cut it short, here are my questions:\n\n1. Does getting a hysterectomy and going on hormones solve the moodswings problem? \n\n2. How did estrogen affect you after the hysterectomy? Does it make your body more feminine? Do the mood swings continue? How does it affect your ADHD?\n\n3. Do birth control help (with moodswings and getting rid of your period) ?\n\n4. Does birth control affect your ADHD ? What about medication?\n\n5. Are there any other option i have that idk about?\n\n6. Are there other subreddits that would be better to ask this on?",

I‚Äôm a current junior and am hoping to graduate within the next two years. \n\nThere have been many ups and downs with my learning career while having ADHD, but one thing that sticks out to me is doing my homework. I struggle with turning in assignments on time, spending enough time on them, and generally just doing them. I found that one thing that helps is doing homework with other people. Even if it‚Äôs in complete silence - just sitting with someone makes such a huge difference for me and I don‚Äôt know why. \n\nI was wondering if there was some sort of online group that does homework together, like maybe a Discord where people call and just sit together doing homework or studying? Or if anyone else here with ADHD struggles to do homework alone, we could start a group to work on stuff together. I‚Äôd love to know if there‚Äôs a pre-existing support group where you can call other people and work on stuff with them.\n\nThank you guys so much in advance!",

I have a bad habit of over-explaining my thoughts or feelings on things and when I do that they either just flat out ignore me or they give a one word reply and move on to a different topic. My advice or insights on things are often ignored in favor of someone else's. They don't put any effort in trying to understand me when I have a hard time trying to word something. I'm always the butt of the jokes, etc etc.\n\nThe one that bothers me the most is how they treat my emotions. Emotional dysregulation is something I struggle with a *lot*, and I completely understand that it wouldn't be easy to deal with someone like that, but it's like they intentionally twist my words to make it sound like I have bad intentions when I get upset/emotional over something.\n\nOne example that I still think about a lot is when I was crying and having a mental breakdown over something while they were making jokes about it. They were upset about it too and using humor to cope, so I don't fault them for that, but when I tried to ask if they wouldn't joke at the moment because it was making me feel worse they blew up on me and said they shouldn't have to walk eggshells around me and acted like me asking that was an overreaction and telling them what they're allowed to say or do. It's like they just completely disregarded how I felt because I didn't have the same emotional reaction they did and they didn't want to accomodate for that.\n\nAll of it just makes me so conflicted because despite how bad that all sounds they're still good friends most of the time and I love doing things with them but I think they just... Don't like me when I show the negative parts of adhd. It's like a constant back and forth of loving them and their friendship and then feeling absolutely terrible about myself around them. I'm not even sure how I would go about bringing it up with them because they probably think that just because they deal with mental health issues that there's no way they could discriminate against someone else who does, and I'm also just scared that they would get mad at me again for overreacting.\n\nI'm just tired of feeling stupid all the time I guess :( I hate that having adhd makes me come off as childish to others and even my own friends don't take me seriously and joke about me like I'm a child",
