Went with the blue Ray II and couldn't be happier. There were other pre owned options within budget but the look of this thing brand new out of the box is stunning and for the price (given my budget), I think it was a no-brainer. Love the lume on it too really functional. Definitely caught the bug. Now it's just a scenic uphill climb towards an unatainable Lange. Let me dream.",

I wanna stay on a 38mm watch so that it will fit now and also later in his life. \n\nI will show him all the watches I will select and I will make him choose from the list the one that he likes the most. What watches do you suggest? Hamilton khaki would be the most obvious choice but maybe you will come up with something different.",

        "text": "It's Wednesday and we're swamped with new releases. This is the longest edition to date, so please stick with me.\n\nWhat's new\n\n**Citizen Introduces New Eco-Drive 365 With An Entirely New Movement**\n\n/ Citizen is not really know for their vintage re-issues and have for years delegated retro watches to another brand they own - Bulova. But they’re slowly coming around, seeing the truckloads of money other brands are raking in banking on their heritage.\n\nThis could be the reason why the new Citizen Eco-Drive 365 is based off of one of its earliest quartz models, a 1973 Citizen Quartz E.F.A. (Extra Fine Adjustment). The vintage model was a futuristic look forward at the supremacy of the quartz era. Today quartz watches are mostly reserved for non-enthusiasts, but Citizen’s new movement might be interesting enough for watch nerds as well, by sticking it’s most advanced movement to date into a very sexy vintage case.\n\nThe new movement is called the E365. Yeah, you guessed it - the 365 stands for one year. The Citizen Eco-Drive 365 can run on one full year on a single charge. It’s accurate to -/+15 seconds per month and a full charge takes about 11 hours in direct sunlight and 40 hours on a cloudy day.\n\nThat’s all fine and good. But where the new collection shines is it’s vintage inspired design. The case is lugless and measures 42.5mm in diamter and is 11.1mm thick, while the crown is recessed. Two of the models are offered in full steel cases with matching bracelets and foldover clasps, one of which features black ion-plating throughout, and the other of which features just a black IP bezel. Both of those models feature radial brushing on the bezel and sunburst brushing on the case, with brushed bracelet links. The third model is a near copy of the original 1973, with a fully polished case and a brown leather strap. This will also be a limited edition of 1200 pieces. Water resistance is reported at 100m.\n\nThe dials are very interesting - they have a glittery black finish. Citizen says it reminds them of a moonless night sky. And you know what? It actually does. The limited edition Seiko’s dial features lab-grown rubies cap the markers at 12-3-6-9. Interestingly, none of the three models feature lume. The price is $480 for the steel model (BN1014-55E), $530 for the black model (BN1015-52E), and $875 for the limited edition (BN1010-05E).\n\n**We’re Not Done With New Seiko Models, There’s a New Limited Edition Seiko 5**\n\n/ It was just last week that Seiko introduced a number of new models, including a new Customized model range based on user feedback. Now they’re introducing a new limited edition that’s not half bad. I mean, can it be bad if it’s based on a cult 70s Japanese TV show?\n\nThe newly released Seiko 5 SRPJ91 Masked Rider Limited Edition model SRPJ91 is based on the 5126-9080 from 1968, a watch featured in the Japanese TV show Kamen Rider, which was also known as The Masked Rider. The original became quite desirable among collectors and is now relatively difficult to find and aren’t that cheap.\n\nThe new watch is visually similar to the original, but it obviously uses the modern 42mm Seiko 5 Sports case. It takes inspiration from the original, but does not copy the colors directly. The dial is a greenish color with some texturing, while the vintage-looking black leather strap has red backing. Seiko went all out with the link to the Masked Rider on the caseback, which has smoky glass display back with the “Tachibana Racing” logo that was used in the show.\n\nThere will be 4,000 individually numbered pieces of the Seiko 5 Masked Rider Limited Edition with availability starting in April. Seiko did not communicate a price, but several websites say it’s £380.\n\n**The Angelus x Massena LAB Chronographe Médical Might Just Be The Watch Revival Of The Year**\n\n/ Angelus is introducing a new collection named La Fabrique and they have teamed up with design studio Massena LAB to create a re-edition of a stunning vintage doctor’s watch, which is now powered by an internally-produced movement.\n\nAngelus has a rich and impressive history. However, in recent years, it’s almost like the brand is was trying to purposefully move away from it. With the Angelus x Massena LAB Chronographe Médical they’re taking a sharp turn back towards their heritage. This is a watch modelled after a 1960s doctor’s watch, with a singular purpose - to help doctors read vital signs of their patients so it includes a pulsometer to measure the pulse and an asthmometer to measure the respiratory rate.\n\nThe case is compact at 39mm, 9.22mm in thickness, with slim bezels that really blow out the dial. And the dial is one of the two very special things about this watch. Slightly domed and silvered opaline with a warm off-white feel, the dial features the same dual-scale layout as the original model, with a pulsometer scale on the periphery, and covering the first quarter of the dial, as well as an asthmometer scale that is located inside the seconds scale, with a 5-breath base. The pulsometer even has a specific colour code – green, black, or red – corresponding to the severity of the reading obtained during the examination. Both have a very large font to make them more legible.\n\nInside the watch is an impressive movement. It’s not a modification of an off the shelf Sellita. It’s the Angelus Calibre A5000, made in-house within the facilities of La Joux-Perret (sister company of Angelus), which is the modern evolution of a movement once done by THA and Journe, only drastically reworked and upgraded.\n\nThis is a limited edition of 99 pieces and is priced at $19,900, excluding taxes.\n\n**Unimatic Releases The Modello Quattro U4S-T-HS, Their First GMT Modello Quatro**\n\n/ I have been saying it all year and I’ll say it again - 2023 will be the year of the GMT. Brands with fantastic GMT watches will come out with more GMT variants. Brands without them will introduce their first GMT models. Take, for instance, Unimatic. They have teamed up with Canadian outdoor brand Henry Singer to create what? Their first GMT Modello Quattro.\n\nYou can hate on Unimatic for using cheap movements and selling them at a markup, but there’s no denying that Unimatic has a lock down on military style watches that can have at a relatively affordable price. There’s hardly a model on their roster that you can look at and honestly say - I would never own this.\n\nOf course, this is not their first GMT, as they have created some great ones in their other model lines. But it is the first in the Modello Quattro, the military-style watch based on the Modello Uno with a 40mm case but fixed bezel instead of a rotating dive bezel. This new Modello Quattro is not just the first GMT version, it’s also the first with a titanium case. As such, it is lightweight and easy to wear while still keeping that utilitarian appearance. The watch is very minimal, so it has a gray dial and a silver 24-hour GMT scale on its periphery. The instantly recognizable hour markers and phantom ladder hands are filled with Super-LumiNova in a light “old radium” tone.\n\nThe automatic ETA 2893-2 is a caller GMT movement which allows you to independently set the GMT hand in one-hour increments. It also features a date function, which Unimatic has integrated into the dial at 6 o’clock.\n\nUnfortunately, the watch is limited to 100 pieces and costs $1,995.\n\n**Ressence Introduces a Fantastic Sage Green Color to Their Type 8**\n\n/ I’m not going to lie, Ressence is in my top 5 watchmakers of all time. Since the day they launched their first oil-filled watch, I was mesmerized. A Ressence is on my bucket list and I will spread the gospel of Ressence wherever I can. So I’ll cut it short and just say: look at this color. It’s perfect.\n\n**Speaking of Green, The New Girard-Perregaux Laureato Green Ceramic Aston Martin Edition is stunning**\n\n/ Girard-Perragaux is not considered a contender for a spot in the holy trinity integrated bracelet sports watch discussion. But is that fair? In most cases, yes. But with the new GP Laureato that comes in green ceramic? Boy, is it hard to justify why it can’t be as good or even better than some of the holy-trinity watches.\n\nThere are two sizes to choose from: 38mm and 42mm. Both are 100 metres water-resistant, with the 38mm case clocking in at 10.27mm thick and the 42mm case 11.08mm thick. Their green tones are not bright and bold, almost a darker forrest green.\n\nThe price is very interesting. $25,000 for the 38mm and $25,800 for the 42mm. While it might not seem like a bargain, it just could possibly be, as it’s half the price of a 34mm Royal Oak in ceramic. And that’s black ceramic, not this fantastic green. So GP might just have a hit on their hand and then they go shoot themselves in the foot and make it limited - 188 pieces for the 38mm and 388 pieces for the 42mm.\n\n**H. Moser &amp; Cie. Release Pioneer 40mm Centre Seconds and Tourbillon Arctic Blue**\n\n/ After experimenting with watches made of tantalum, H. Moser &amp; Cie. returns to their regular watchmaking concept of making beautifully simple watches for outrageous prices. So that’s why they introduced a new case size for one of their core collections in the H. Moser &amp; Cie. Pioneer 40mm Centre Seconds and Tourbillon Arctic Blue.\n\nThe Pioneer case is, as its name suggests, H. Moser’s sportiest design, made from scratch- and corrosion-resistant steel with 120m water resistance. This latest generation of the case has a new diameter of 40mm, reduced from 42.8mm, which will surely be appreciated by everyone.\n\nBoth pieces follow similar pricing to their predecessors. That means the H. Moser &amp; Cie. Central Seconds Arctic Blue is £12,900 and the tourbillon is £49,700.\n\n**A Palate Cleanser: Swatch Releases A New Art Journey Collection**\n\n/ Following the news of releases of $50.000 watches, it’s nice to hear about something more affordable. This year’s Swatch Art Journey Collection consists of five capsule collections. Four of those were presented last week, and in May, the final one will also be unveiled. Swatch is coming out with two watches featuring art by René Magritte, three watches featuring Roy Lichtenstein, two watches featuring Botticelli’s Allegoria della Primavera (Allegory of Spring) and Nascita di Venere (The Birth of Venus) and one with Kanagawa oki nami ura (The Great Wave off Kanagawa) by Katsushika Hokusai.\n\nThe price of the watches will be €95 for the smaller 34mm Gent size and €105 for the bigger 41mm New Gent size\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn hand - a selection of review\n\n**Hands-On With The Entry-Level Citizen CA4560-81L Eco-Drive Chronograph**\n\n**Speaking Of Pulsometers, Excapement Magazine Has Reviewed The Delma Continental Pulsometer**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWatch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n**Is There Space In The Horology World For a Chinese Brand?**\n\nCIGA Design is a young watch brand and has created a hit with their first model Can they get over the sophomore slump with their second? Beyond the need to build upon the foundation of its award-winning core design, the brand has arguably taken up the mantle of delivering innovative Chinese horology to the masses, which only adds to the pressure on its current slate of releases. With this in mind, any follow-up to the 2021 release of the CIGA Design Blue Planet is bound to garner intense enthusiast scrutiny,\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to receive some additional watch-adjacent content, as well as this news overview, every morning Monday-Friday feel free to subscribe.

I'll wear it for a few minutes, and then the winding rotor just spontaneously starts spinning of its own accord. It's almost like the mainspring has so much torque that it overcomes the weight of the rotor and drives it faster and faster. It goes so hard that I'll feel the centrifugal weight transfer.\n\nSo my question is: what is happening here, and how do I stop it?",

Nice contrast between polished and brushed stainless steel. Sunburst dial and polished steel looks superb under both sunlight and artificial light. \n\nIt's worth pointing out that there are only two holes for micro-adjustment which will mean some people will struggle to find a perfect fit and a replacement clasp may need to be ordered. Also there is no lume on the hands or indices but let's face it, lume is overrated unless on a dive watch so who cares about that. \n\nGet one while you can! \n\nCheers 😎",
