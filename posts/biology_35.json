        "text": "Me and my friend were talking about humans being ticklish on our foot soles and evolution. We were speculating and we figured that maybe so many nerves were needed to balance out our calloused foot soles from walking barefoot and we wondered if we might lose them in the future. I mentioned how I find it mind-boggling to think about evolution/natural selection in this day and age, as beyond attractiveness/beauty there are not that many traits anymore (excuse me a little for speaking mainly of the western world) that make the difference between life or death and with modern developments in fertility treatments/options and improvements in medicine, etc etc etc. and I don't see how having more or less foot-sole-nerve-endings could ever result in 'natural selection' today.\n\nThen, my friend says:  \n\"But natural selection is not the only way species adapt to their environment. Sometimes the environment is also a specific driving force for a change in the species. \" (So, besides natural variance in species shifting to favour or lose a certain trait over time as a reaction to the environment, the environment also dictates future mutation/adaptation/traits)\n\nIn general I can't quite find what he means online and I don't even fully understand it but I'm convinced it's not true. Random mutations/natural population variance + survival/reproductive statistics + a lot of time = adaptations. (and we are not talking about behavioural changes) Is there another way animals sometimes adapt? We are both completely convinced of ourselves...\n\nHe also mentioned a documentary (which he can't remember the name of) on rats that showed that they have great adaptability. If there is a colony in which 'less important' rats are used by the leader of the pack, when they find an unfamiliar substance, the 'less important' rats are ordered to eat it, and if they die, then all rats are ordered to go and sniff it and it's very likely for future generations of that pack to be already immune to it. \n\n\\[TL;DR: Aside from natural selection, is there another way species adapt to their environment that is not behavioural?\\]",

        "text": "My biology teacher told me to make an experiment on this at home and I'm almost done working on it. I found this video on youtube ([https://youtu.be/id0aO\\_OdFwA](https://youtu.be/id0aO_OdFwA)) and made it similar one myself with things I can find at home or nearby. I only used a common aquatic plant, baking soda, lamp and transparent tall plastic cup for this and I couldn't able to use the formal scientific setup with test tube and funnel etc like from my textbook. I think mine went okay as I saw bubbles being released but I'm not quite sure that the bubbles of gas released are oxygen gas alone or could it also be carbon dioxide gas from the baking soda solution? I've seen videos on how they were able to tell that oxygen gas was released during the experiment by testing with a glowing splint in the test tube afterwards but I don't know how can I make sure or to prove that the oxygen gas is actually released only if CO2 bubbles are also mixed in it. Only if it's true that CO2 bubbles are also being released alongside O2, we cannot count the bubbles released in a time anymore as we only want to count the O2 bubbles right?? Then, in the video, how was she able to count?? I'm so confused right now. I really hope some of you here could help me understand this. Thank you so much!",

I'm considering taking a programming course there bc I thought it might be helpful in the future, but I want to ask people who are further ahead in their careers if it is really? \n\nI have taken an Intro to Python course for biologists in my Bachelor's and did quite well in it. That course is my only experience in programming and I was thinking that maybe knowing more would be helpful in my future career. The course teaches Java, which I don't think is as popular of a language. I am still uncertain what my career path will be, maybe something in industry, lab technician, I'm unsure if I want to be a researcher. \n\nI am currently choosing between Programming, and Forensics (can't take both bc I have other courses). The only con for programming is that it is 5h/week while forensics only takes 3h/week, so it is more work. I'm interested in both programming, and forensics, and I heard very mix reviews on the programming course. Some found it easy, but some recent posts said that it is difficult, so Im also a bit worried there. \n\nSo my big question is, how helpful is knowing how to program with Java? Will it be advantageous? I just need some opinions on this.",

        "text": " WHAT IS THE STARCHILD SKULL?\n\nThe Starchild Skull is a 900 year old bone skull found in Mexico in the 1930s. It is most famous for the attention it attracts among alien enthusiasts, who believe it may be at least partly alien. \\[It should be noted that the Starchild Project does not assert it is an alien, however we do not exclude this possibility entirely.\\] The Skull has been tested and examined by various medical and scientific experts since 1999, and no human condition or deformity has yet been identified that can explain its wide variety of abnormal characteristics.\n\nTests Conducted Include:\n\n* [CT Scan](https://www.starchildproject.com/starchild-skull-ct-scan), which proved the Skull was not deformed by abnormal fusion of the cranial sutures (the bone plates of the Starchild Skull are not stuck together in a way that stopped the skull growing properly and changed its shape)  \n \n* [X-Rays](https://www.starchildproject.com/starchild-skull-x-rays), which showed the bone of the Skull to be uniformly thinner than normal human bone, that it had no frontal sinuses, and that there was no fluid or other abnormality between the brain and the inside of the skull  \n \n* [Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analysis](https://www.starchildproject.com/starchild-bone), which discovered highly unusual microscopic fibers inside the bone of the Skull  \n \n* [Expert Analysis of the physical structure of the bone](https://www.starchildproject.com/dr-robinson-deformity-study), which identified the bone as much thinner and lighter than normal human bone, but also discovered that it is much stronger than human bone, a feature possibly related to the fibers in the bone  \n \n* DNA Analysis, which is ongoing, but has already uncovered some intriguing preliminary (unverified) results, and left experts optimistic that further testing will provide enough evidence to prove the Skull is a new species.\n\n###### What is the Starchild Skull?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRECONSTRUCTION CREATED BY BILL MUNNS\n\nThe Starchild Skull exhibits both physical and genetic differences that distinguish it from a typical human skull.\n\nAn extensive range of conditions including Anophthalmia / Microphthalmia, Apert Syndrome, Cradleboarding (and other artificial cranial deformations), Cruzon Syndrome, Hydrocephaly, Morgellons Disease. Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome, Progeria (Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome), and Trisomy 9 (Mosaic) have been examined as possible causes for the unusual characteristics of the Starchild Skull, but so far no condition or combination of conditions has been found that explains the skull.\n\n**List of Starchild Skull Abnormalities:**\n\nThe bone is uniformly half as thick, or less, than normal human bone. It is not thin in a specific area or areas due to abnormality, it is thin all over.\n\nThe skull itself weighs half as much as human skulls of comparable size.\n\nThe surface of normal human bone is covered with tiny holes called lacunae, which perform the vital function of replacing old bone cells with new ones. The Starchild bone shows virtually no lacunae.\n\nInside the bone are microscopic “fibers” that may act to reinforce and strengthen the bone.\n\nAll bone is like a sandwich with hard cortical bone on the outside and porous cancellous bone that looks like a spone in the middle. The cancellous bone is where the bone marrow is stored. After death this marrow turns black and is consumed by micro-organisms. The cancellous holes of the 900 year old skull found next to the Starchild are completely empty, however the cancellous holes of the 900 year old Starchild bone contain traces of a red residue.\n\nThe lower face of the Starchild Skull is much smaller than a normal human.\n\nIt has no brow ridges, which all primates have. Its forehead is smoothly curved straight down to its upper eye sockets, unlike humans or any higher primate.\n\nWhen a human forehead reaches its upper eye sockets, normally there is a sharp drop down to the pinched-together bones that create the upper nose. In the Starchild there is no drop. The nose extends straight and smooth from the forehead, staying wide and flat until the point where it is broken off, unlike that of humans and all higher primates\n\nThe Starchild Skull’s eye sockets are unusually shaped and are only 0.7 inches at maximum depth, compared to normal human eye sockets which average about 2 inches deep.\n\nThe optic foramens are the openings in the back of a human eye socket which let in the optic nerve and all the other nerves and blood vessels that “feed” each eyeball and allow it to function. In the Starchild Skull these are shaped and positioned differently.\n\nThe Starchild Skull had no frontal sinuses, an extremely rare condition.\n\nAll that remains of the Starchild’s lower face is the right side maxilla. The roof of its mouth was flat, lacking any sign of a normal human arch, and like all of the lower face, it is much smaller than that of a normal human.\n\nThe Starchild’s zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are broken off, but from the small fragments that remain it is clear that the space between the cheekbones and the other bones of the face is much smaller than it would be in a normal human. This is significant because the chewing muscles for the lower jaw pass through this space, and so must have been much smaller than in a normal human.\n\nHuman chewing muscles attach from the lower jaw to the side of the skull, extending over a large area of the skull. The starchild's chewing muscles The chewing muscles cover only about half as much of the skull.\n\nThe Starchild Skull’s ear holes are positioned lower on the head than in a normal human.\n\nThe Starchild’s inner ears are approximately twice the size of normal human inner ears.\n\nThe Starchild’s neck muscles attach in a way that indicates it was a very small neck relative to typical humans, no more than half of normal size.\n\nHuman neck muscles normally attach at an elevated point in the rear center of the occipital bone (the rear bone of the skull). That elevated point is called the “external occipital protuberance,” or “inion” for short. All humans, and indeed all primates on Earth, have an inion. The Starchild Skull does not.\n\nIn addition to the external occipital protuberance on the outside of the skull, there is an \"internal occipital protuberance” on the inside. This functions like a shelf holding some of the weight of the brain. While the Starchild does have this internal shelf, it is much smaller than it would be in a normal human.\n\nThough the rear of the Starchild Skull is widely expanded and greatly flattened, this is not the result of deliberate binding or cradleboarding. This was verified in 2004 br Dr Ted Robinson and his team.\n\nAt the top of the rear of the Starchild’s head is a noticeable “crease” at the rear of its saggital suture, where it meets the lambdoidal suture. The only possible way this can happen in a human skull is if there is abnormal fusion of the saggital suture. A CAT Scan showed that no such abnormal fusion exists in the Starchild Skull.\n\nThe Starchild Skull’s physical size is of a small adult in the range of 5 feet tall, or an average 12-year-old, which means its brain should be about 1200 cubic centimeters. An average adult has 1400 c.c. of brain. Instead the Starchild has 1600 c.c. of brain.\n\nThe teeth of the Skull are a controversial subject, as many experts feel they show the Starchild was a child of about 5 years old, however the biting surfaces of the teeth are worn and ground to a degree that seems impossible for such a young child, especially one with smaller than normal chewing muscles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n###### DNA TESTING SUMMARY\n\n[**2012, Undisclosed Lab, Key Finding is FOXP2 fragment**](https://www.starchildproject.com/starchild-skull-foxp2-dna)\n\nPreliminary testing recovered what appears to be a fragment of the Starchild Skull's FOXP2 gene. This fragment differs from the corresponding human gene fragment in 56 positions along the DNA strand. This gene is highly conserved between species and is essential to human development.  In humans, it is linked to speech and cognitive function. This particular gene fragment is absolutely identical in every human and apes and has only ONE difference in monkeys, lending weight to the hypothesis that the Skull, with 56 differences, is not a human being. This finding, if proven, will raise many questions about how it developed and what abilities it may or may not have had. The results obtained need to be reproduced, verified, and extended.\n\n[**2011, Undisclosed Lab, Key Finding is unusual mtDNA**](https://www.starchildproject.com/starchild-mitochondrial-dna)\n\nA US based genetics lab (name withheld for security reasons) conducted preliminary testing on samples of the Starchild Skull using advanced DNA testing technology. The result is partial and needs to be reproduced, verified, and extended. Mitochondrial DNA sequences recovered were submitted to the US National Institutes of Health BLAST for comparison to all other DNA in their database. Some of the DNA was similar to that of a human. However, large amounts of it were not similar enough to anything in the extensive database to be matched. The fact that the DNA recovered from the Starchild could not be matched within the database shows that the strange DNA is unlikely to be the result of bacterial or other contamination, as the database would have registered bactierial DNA. If these results can be reproduced and verified, it will show that the Skull is a previously undiscovered species\n\n2010, Undisclosed Lab, Key Finding is first recovery of nuDNA\n\nNuclear DNA (from both parents, gives individuals their unique qualities) was recovered from the Starchild Skull for the first time.\n\nThis DNA was submitted to the US National Institutes of Health BLAST for comparison to all other DNA in their database. Some of the DNA was similar to that of a human while some could not be matched. If these results can be reproduced and verified, it will show that the Skull is a previously undiscovered species.\n\n[**2003, Trace Genetics, California USA: First ancient DNA test done on the Starchild Skull**](https://www.starchildproject.com/trace-genetics-dna-report)\n\nState-of-the-art at the time, this test was only able to recover human DNA, any other DNA in the sample was ignored. The test recovered a small amount of human mtDNA from the Starchild Skull, but despite six attempts and evidence that there was some sort of nuDNA in the sample, no human nuDNA could be recovered. This led to public speculation about a human-alien hybrid, but this has since been dismissed in favor of the more plausible explanation that it is a new species that has some genetic similarities to humans.\n\n[**1999, BOLD, British Columbia, Canada: First DNA test conducted on the Starchild Skull**](https://www.starchildproject.com/1999-dna-report)\n\nUnable to access a lab equipped to test 900 year old DNA, the Project opted to attempt to recover DNA using a lab with equipment only designed to recover forensic (less than 50 years old) DNA. After multiple contaminations, the BOLD lab recovered a tiny amount of nuclear DNA, 10% of the usual minimum amount of DNA required to give an accurate result. This DNA was from a human male Y chromosome. As subsequent testing with more advanced equipment has not been able to duplicate this result, and as the main difference between a forensic and ancient DNA testing lab is that forensic labs are not capable of removing as much contamination as an ancient DNA lab, the Starchild Project supports the belief of many experts that this result was not accurate, and was likely the result of contamination of the bone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the full research click on this website :[https://www.starchildproject.com/](https://www.starchildproject.com/)",
