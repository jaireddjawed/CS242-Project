        "text": "\nThis is going to be quite long so I apologise in advanced and ANY advice would be appreciated. I met my baby daddy almost 3 years ago, for the sake of the story I’m going to call him Tom and his best friend Jay. I’m normally a very intuitive person, but when I met Jay and later on Tom, all of it went out the window. I didn’t pick up on anything, no bad energy nothing. Then as soon as I found out I was pregnant, I stopped smoking, drinking partying and I was pretty much iced out. Then everything started falling into place, comments and vibes that jay was giving off, I started to rethink them. Jay has met me multiple times but I only met him once, the more I think back, the more I realise I’ve seen him in the background of parties, clubs, boat parties in different towns ( long before I met Tom). It turns out that he first met me at 18 and I just brushed him off/ didn’t notice him, which I do if I don’t find people interesting. One time he mentioned ‘ I wanted to met you a long time ago but someone else had their claim on you’. The more I thought back, the more I realised he has always given me cryptic answers like that and never go into further details. I realised that nobody but Jay is ever sober around him, he even tried to feed me alcohol when I was pregnant. Things turned out horribly when Jay told Tom that it wasn’t his baby and playing both sides by telling me he’d would sort it out. I cut my loses and tried to move on but things in my life spiralled, I lost all my friends, then my health deteriorated, I had complications during pregnancy then lost my job, my mental health deteriorated, I started to have sleep paralysis dreams, started seeing shadow people. Later on, I lost my entirely family, deaths in my family. I thought I was just having bad luck… after 2 years of not seeing any of them, everywhere I go lately, I catch Jay in places that normally him nor would be. He is always with a different person and he always pretends not to see me, it reminds me of him sneaking around when I was younger. Places like pubs that are on the other side of town, cafes he’d never go, arcades ect. Every time my best friend pulls a tarot deck for me, it’s always the same outcome, Jay, Jay, Jay being the main denominator. The more I think the more I realise he is cold, calculated and calm with every situation, I feel like he is 10 steps ahead of me, as if he knows what I’m going to do in every situation.  I’m not a violent or angry person and things have been getting better for me and Tom and Jay popped up on the weekend when I had a night out clubbing, I feel the darkness and sinister intentions from Jay yet I still let myself fall prey to my anger and lash out on him, the worst thing is that he always expects it , the mind games, the sneaking around, the little things he did make me feel like he is doing something he isn’t meant to, not to mention when they Jay slept over my house one time, I opened my eyes and he was standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me, I have a feeling he make have taken a piece of my hair but have no proof, he always never let me walked through his front door which I’ve been told is a spiritual thing. I hope everyone understands and I’m not just rambling and trying to put things together. I just have disgusting feeling",

We are in a long-distance relationship, we have this routine of watching movies and falling asleep on the phone. Everything is fine in the day time and evening, but at night we have continuous problems with noises on the phone. He's recorded our conversations several times, while I'm sleeping or moving around there's voices whispering and man talking. I've been trying to rationalize what this is, I keep my tv on when I sleep but the volume is always at 2 so you can barely hear it. I though maybe it's just natural sounds from my background that we are interpreting as \"voices\" or words but this just can't be it. He recorded one last night, while I was turning in my sleep I made a noise that sounded like a moan, then a man's voice clearly says \"I HATE hearing that\" emphasis on hate. The past recordings my bf has done, I've listened to and it sounds like the same voice. I'm not sure what to do at this point, idk if its someone playing in my phone or if this is something paranormal but it doesn't make any sense at all. What is the best option to do here?",

(Before I say further things I should clarify that I have been to a therapist and I don't have anything related to mental illness)..In my family it's me my mom , dad and my sister although only me and my Aunt have this 'thing'..\n\nFrom when I was little she kept saying since I was her favourite I would inherit her \"thing'' . I could see the figures of people that never  passed on the other side left wandering around the world in an attemp to ease themselves. you cant see their faces but only their shadows..  This 'thing'  tho has a set of rules going on for the figures you encounter..\n\nNumber1. You never look straight at them for a long time .\nNumber 2. You don't invite them in NEVER.\nNumber 3 . They can't harm you .. only scare you (unless you invite them in your home thus the number 2)\nNumber 4. You always carry a cross with you.\nNumber 5. If it goes too far pray and everything will be fine.\n\nFrom times to times I would often see spirits in my dreams trying to come in my place in the form of my late grandpa or friendly figures even in the form of cats and dogs and other things .. the good part is that you could always sense that they are evil .. I don't know how it works really u just get it .. u sense the evilness in their eyes .( If you would like I could make a thread with my dreams ).. I am actually a lucid dreamer since childhood and can always control and alter my dreams.(Stick to that for later).\n\nAlthough it didn't stuck to dreams only..I remember one night I was casually playing Lol in my computer (assemble gamers of reddit) and I heard footsteps and screaming from outside .. current time was 3 03 at night and I went on my balcony.. I saw in the wall figures of people running with wagons crying.. screaming in a language I didn't know and never heard of ,little kids falling and being pressed to death by the feet of others and torches in the air . It was so loud I checked the other apartments but no one was out ..The road was empty and u couldn't see anything In miles except from me that could still see the figures in the wall  .. it was the first time that I froze and felt that I couldn't move .. tears where streaming down my face and I could barely breath by the smell of the torches in the air .. \n\nI closed my eyes and prayed thus falling into the ground and hitting my ankle . Everything went silent and I went back inside but  as soon as I closed the window the smell of the torch flattered my apartment and I could see visible smoke in the air.. I opened the window again and quietly went and covered myself in my blanket crying all night and praying..\n\n\nMy grandma came down the next morning woke me up and informed me that it was my time to deliver the koliva and bread (spiritual food we cook for the dead in Greek Orthodox church.) cause it was an all souls day and my uncles where waiting for me to deliver..\n\nOf course no one believed me and laughed that I dreamed it but I know the truth and it's far from that maybe my\" thing'' got triggered due to the day ..\n\nI don't know who they where or why they where fleeing but I was sad for days and couldn't forget the cries,the trembling of the voices or the bones being crushed and the wagons wheels screeching..\n\nSometimes I still dream it...\n\nSorry for some bad English its not my first language..",

        "text": "It's not like I didn't know there was some unexplained occurrences in this house.  Back story:  It was built in 1850 and belonged to my grandparents.  My grandfather was the town Dr so a part of the house used to be a waiting room and his examination room.  My daughter has been living here for several years.  It's a huge house with 3 floors and immense rooms.  I recently moved in with her.  \n\nOver the years, she's shared odd little factoids such as, \"They were getting loud in the waiting room.  I had to tell them to pipe down.\"   Every once in a while she will have friends over and doesn't want them scared off.  \n\nI had no problem with my bedroom in the old waiting room.  I half expected something to happen but idle thoughts are nothing like the real thing.  The former waiting room has a door for patients to walk in from outside that hasn't been used in years and I mean even before my daughter moved in.   \nThe past few nights I thought I had dreamt there was soft rapping at that door.  Just a dream.   \n\nThis time I was wide awake when I heard 3 nearly soundless knocks at the waiting room door.  Not a big deal, right?  Immediately following by 3 angry loud \"I'm going to break down this door to get in\" knocks.  I involuntarily shouted \"Whoa!\" but no human voice was on the other side.  I noted the time \"3:15am\" before making a quick getaway after grabbing my laptop and cell phone.  I fought hard not to wake up my daughter but stayed in the living room watching \"A Fish Called Wanda\" for probably the 17th time.\n\nHere's my question for anyone who has experienced this or something like this.  Has anyone handled this event without running to another part of the house (like me)?  I am most certainly not moving out.  In fact, I plan to buy a Ring Doorbell to record video in case it happens, again.  It was not the wind and it wasn't tree branches.  What other rational explanation could there be?   Of course, 20 questions are running through my head at the same time like \"What does this mean?\"  Thank you for listening if you made your way through this entire novella.  I feel better just from sharing it.",

We had all just met maybe two months prior so we basically knew nothing about each other aside from the basic stuff. When we first started using the board that night the first few things that were spelled out to us didn't make any sense but for some reason I decided to ask if it could tell me my mothers middle name (which only I knew) and it spelled it out almost immediately. Right off the bat with that I felt uneasy and realized that I was actually possibly communicating with something or someone. soon after that it spelled out a girls name that started with an M, I cant remember what the name was but it turned out to be the name of a baby that my friends mother had lost and I could tell this girl wasn't fucking with me I swear on everything I love I saw absolute terror and sadness written all over her face. Directly after that the board spelled out \"the lamb that ate it's mother\" and my friends dog started growling at her front door so we said goodbye stopped. I haven't touched a ouija board since. Whatever it was I think it stayed at her house because she switched bedrooms with her mom the next day because she didn't feel like she was alone in her room. To this day I have not been able to find a single clue as to what \"the lamb that ate its mother\" could've meant but I've never found anything aside from bible quotes about lambs but never anything even close to what that board said that night. Sorry this is kind of long winded but if anyone has any info on what it could mean I'd really appreciate some insight.",

        "text": "Hello! I've never posted here before, but a few strange things have occurred to me and my boyfriend since we moved into our current flat last July and I just feel like this would be the best place for me to get it off my chest. It might be a little long so I apologise in advance, but I was just looking for maybe answers or some sort of advice.\n\nBefore I describe these events, I will say that I began experiencing sleep paralysis around four years ago and have had a range of unpleasant experiences with it in the past. However, these experiences have never been physical, only visual, until moving into this new flat. I will also say that my boyfriend has never had any past experiences regarding anything that he would consider paranormal, though the events that have occurred in the flat have left us both a bit confused and spooked.\n\nSince my boyfriend and I moved into our flat, we have experienced minor things such as noises sounding like something has fallen onto the floor and begun to roll across it, only to find nothing that could have made the noise. Other times we have heard noises as if something large is being dragged across the wall in the hallway, but when we have opened our door to check what is making all the noise, there is nothing there and the motion sensor light is off (If it is activated it stays lit for around 5 minutes). One very common thing we experience is the chain on the bedroom blinds rocks from side to side sometimes. This doesn't happen as a gentle swaying though, there have been a number of occasions where we have gone into the bedroom to investigate a loud clattering noise (we have heard it over the volume of our tv or music) to find it swinging from left to right, rather than forwards or backwards. We have tried to explain this away as just a draft, but this would continue to happen even when there was no possible airflow from windows, vents, fans or the radiator. Even if this were to be caused by any of these things, the chain would swing forwards and backwards, not left to right and it definitely wouldn't make such a noise to begin with. It sounds as if it has been lifted up and released, causing it to hit the wall and then begin to sway.\n\nUpon initially moving in, I was having terrible trouble sleeping or staying asleep, to the point where I had to seek medical advice. I was sleeping during the day as I work a part-time night shift while I am at university and finish work at 7:30am but have since just started going to bed earlier in the evening. When I was actually managing to sleep, I would have very graphic intense nightmares, some were so bad I would wake up and just burst into tears. On a few occasions, I would have sleep paralysis too but there was one time this happened that ended up really shaking me up. Across from my bed is a wardrobe where both doors are fully mirrored. The right side wall as you see it from the bed also has a mirror above a small desk. During this particular sleep paralysis, I watched my boyfriend (who was not home, but at work) walk past the wardrobe mirrors, from left to right, but this appeared only as his reflection INSIDE the mirror. 'He' then wasn't visible for a moment as he seemed to have walked out of the frame of the mirror until I saw the reflection walk past the other mirror on the right. After this, there was nothing for a few seconds but I was still 'in paralysis', until I felt something yank the bottom of my duvet covers away from me. Cliche I know, but this had never happened to me before, it spooked me out of my sleep paralysis and I shot up and grabbed my covers towards me. I still don't know how to explain this away as my sleep paralysis experiences have never been physical like this so I don't really know what to make of it.\n\nAnother similar instance happened one night my boyfriend was driving home from work and got stuck in a bad traffic jam on the motorway, delaying him a good few hours due to the distance from the site he had been working at. Because I was working early, I went to bed before he arrived home. At some point in the evening, I remember him getting home and me having a sleepy conversation with him right before he got in bed and I fell back asleep. I'm not sure how long after this I was woken up again but I was woken up by my boyfriend who was standing at the side of the bed and had brought us some food. I was instantly confused, asking where he had got the food from and when he had left to get it, to be met with the same confusion. Apparently, he had only just gotten home. I'm still so confused by this as this is not something that has ever happened to me and really creeped us both out and I don't know what to make of it.\n\nThe final straw for me was one evening I was talking to my boyfriend as I was just walking around tidying up, only to turn to him at one point and see what can only be described as a solid silhouette of a child crouched down directly behind him. At this point I started straight up freaking out, running into the bedroom and refusing to leave for the rest of the night. The next day I contacted my step-mum who is very spiritual and has had all sorts of encounters and experience with the unseen world, including running her own business where she does reiki and tarot, amongst other things. My dad and my step-mum came to visit the following weekend where she cleansed the flat and recommended I buy black tourmaline for protection, which I have. Since then, this kind of activity has decreased but not stopped entirely, resigning itself to just the random unexplainable noises. One thing that I noted when my step-mum came to cleanse the flat was that she had asked who's side of the bed it was that my boyfriend slept on, but didn't elaborate and honestly I didn't ask why at the time but I am going to as the events keep playing on my mind and I feel like I have no answers to anything.\n\nI really don't know what to make of any of this, the only connections I can make are all leading back to my boyfriend, with the silhouette crouched behind him, the physical sleep paralysis, him getting home twice in the same night and my step-mum asking about his side of the bed. This is the second place we have lived together and the occurrences only started upon moving here. I did scour the depths of the internet and found that supposedly we live right by a ley line but I've found no solid evidence to support this, though it is apparently discussed in a book about the city that was published in 1987 which talks about legends, folklore and mysteries. This particular book however seems pretty hard to come across, with it either being unavailable or unaffordable. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or ideas that I could investigate into a little bit more as for now, I'm clueless. Much appreciated!",

For as long as I can remember I've been somewhat sensitive but have always been told I'm being dramatic and that it's all in my head.\n\nThis has caused me to forget a lot of old experiences I didn't even know happened until I asked my sister and she told me I used to scare her and my siblings by telling them some of the things if see when we were all trying to sleep to the point where we'd all move to my parents bed. Could also be because I was too young to remember but, she told me I saw a crouched/hunched figure at one of our high window watching us sleep and saw a man watching stairing at us through the window (would explain why I was so scared of windows and being in a room on my own for so long)\n\nThen there's the part where I used to have very vivid and scary dreams every single night to the point where I'd wake up in cold sweat.\n\nSaw a cat walking around out of the corner of my eye. Sometimes it was a black cat, other times it would look like my childhood cat, only when I'd turn around there was nothing there.\n\nHeard a voice calling my name at random times that sounded a lot like my mother or oldest sister. My siblings who were very close to my age (younge and older brother, both 2 year age gaps between me and them) said the same thing happened to them too, although when I brought it up again to them years later, neither of them seemed to remember this ever happening. \n\nEarliest experience I do actually remember very vividly is the time I woke up in the middle of the night feeling very cold and realising the blanket had been pulled off of me. For context, I was sleeping with my mother and baby brother when this happened so she remembers me waking her up and telling her I was scared. Ofc she was half asleep and didn't pay any mind when I told her there was a shadow figure standing next to the bed stairing at me. I've read a lot of stories on them and everyone seems to describe them as very large and tall. \n\nWhich is interesting because the one I saw was very small and child sized. (I was small for my size as a kid and was mistaken for being 2-3 years younger than I was and the shadow person was very close in height to me, for context I was 6-7ish when this happened) Remember it being really scary at the time but now I think it might or been a curious child spirit? When it noticed I started crying from being so frighted they slowly tilted their head to the side almost out of curiosity if that makes sense??\n\nCouple years later when I was 8 years old we moved. Now I've always had in intense fear of being grabbed in my sleep so I'd sort of cocoon myself under my blanket by tucking all corners under myself before going to sleep and layer there until exhaustion finally hit. My mom and boyfriend at the time were both sleeping at my feet, we were all women and children in the house for clarification. \n\nAnyways as I was doing my nightly corner tucking and pulling them under me, a large hand came in from nowhere and grabbed mine. The door had been closed so none of my older sisters could have come in, everyone had been asleep. Couldn't have been my mom or her boyfriend either because they were sleeping at my feet. So I kind of froze there for what felt like hours in shock but might of been minutes or seconds, couldn't be sure. Did manage to pull my hand away at some point. And ofc because my mom sleeps like a rock, she wouldn't wake up when I desperately tried to pinch her awake so I fell back asleep.\n\nAfter that nothing really happened for a good while until I was 13-14 and we'd moved again. It was fairly early in the morning, 6-7am I think. Decided to go wake my brother up so we could watch adventure time on the tv. Ctv had a breakfast show thing where they streamed episodes early in the morning.\n\nRemembered I forgot something upstairs and told him to start setting the TV up while I go fetch it upstairs. Ran up the stairs, turned to go down the hallway to my room, grabbed the thing in my room, turned around and went to a screeching halt. \n\nThe hallways was fairly dark from nearly all the doors being closed and the little amount of daylight coming in. I was fairly confused at first and thought it might of been my mom of her bf because they managed to open the door, close it behind themselves and then proceeded to stand in front of the door unmoving right across from me. \n\nWasn't either of them either because I called out both for my mom send her boyfriend thinking it was them. Only response I got was deafening silence. Soon as I realised what I was incountering was paranormal dread set in and I froze in place. Once again, we had a stare down until I cracked with the tears. Funny little detail I seem to remember for whatever reason is it not having any hands?? Thankfully my sister was still in my bedroom behind me asleep, funny thing. Worked up the courage, called her name out and said I was scared. Soon as she turned the light on it vanished in the blink of an eye like it had never been there to begin with.\n\nAfter that happened I'd began hear whispering in that hallways. Started when I was trying to sleep. Couldn't make out what was being said but spooked me enouph. Shared rooms with my sister and she never seemed to hear any of it even though she was wide awake when it happened sometimes. \n\nKnow for a fact it isn't all in my head because this one time when one of my school friends came over, she pointed out the whispering in the staircase first before I even noticed. And ngl that was very validating for me.\n\nHad my sister read me to me sometimes so we didn't disturb everyone else trying to sleep. Don't know when she stopped reading but began getting spooked after I started hearing whispering instead. Shiver went down my spine with goosebumps, thought I was her until I told her she could stop and that it was making me uncomfortable. She was confused and said she wasn't whispering and hadn't been reading for a good while. \n\nOne year for the holidays, all my siblings went to my dad's house but I decided to stay behind. (We have a bunk bed and I sleep on the top bed) Had been in my phone when I heard what sounded like someone sitting down and moving around on my sisters bed. Thought it mightve been thr cat till I noticed theyd been sleeping on my bed. Forgot I was home alone until it hit me later.\n\nNow this is when it starts to escalate. I was 17 when this began happening. All times this happened it was the middle of the day and very well lit in all rooms.\n\nHad been texting my partner at the time when I saw a full body apparition of what seemed to be a teenage girl with short hair and round glasses manifest itself next to me from the corner of my eye for a split second. She seemed to be stairing at me pretty hard too which was weird?? Stared at the space for a couple seconds wondering if I was seeing things. Decided to ignore it and went back to texting. But then it happened again a couple more times, exact same thing as earlier. Definitely not a coincidence me thinks.\n\nA couple weeks later, same type of thing happens again. Expect this time around instead of seeing a girl, saw some hunched over figure stairing at me wide eyed. \n\nFor context, was getting the cat food bag our from under the stairs so I could feed them. Realised I forgot to close the door under the stairs storage space and turn the light off. Turned around to do just that and there it was it front of the door opening. Only saw it for a slit second so only thing I got to see was it's posture and facial expression.\n\nActually have the date for this one happening, 24th November 2021. Was asleep when I began to hear a very up close masculine voice whispering in my hear, to the point when I could feel the breath fanning my ear while I was under my blanket. Don't remember what was being said except for the part where it sounded like they were projecting romantic terms on me and said hello little girl?? Once whatever this was realised I began waking up, it kept making shushing noises and repeating the word sleep. This went on for a minute of two before I couldn't take it anymore and began calling for my sister, shot up, and whipped whipped blanket off. Ofc it stopped immediately.\n\nFast forward a couple months later, we had been packing to move. My bed had been already moved to our new house so I slept on the couch. My family had just went upstairs a couple minutes prior so I tried getting some sleep. Another couple minutes pass and my eyes shoot open when I start hearing multiple voices whispering in the kitchen. Only thing I'd been able to make out was my name being said several times. Whispering didn't stop even when I called for my family upstairs to come down to verify I wasn't going crazy, could still hear whatever this was saying my name. Got ignored for a good couple of minutes which wasn't surprising. Someone did come down eventually thankfully. But once again it stopped when another person got involved. \n\nFast forward, we finally move in, march 22. Waking up the stairs and feel someone breath once on the back of the neck. Sometimes ill just hear a voice whisper hi in the hallway for whatever reason. When that happens I'll just start playing music to tune it out in case they try saying any more. Message my brother on discord so actually have physical texts recording when stuff like this happened.\n\n02/04/2022 at 7:03am\n▪︎You hear that too or no?\n▪︎No. Hear what?\n▪︎swear it sounded like someone whispered an aggressive hi in the hallway\n\n09/10/2022 at 5:45am\n▪︎did you just whisper wtf\n\n22/01/2023 at 6:10am on the dark moon(coincidence or not idk)\n▪︎did you just whisper hi\n▪︎or am I hearing shit again\nPreceeded to call my mom and her boyfriend to check if they were awake (they weren't) and all I got in response was silence and then another whisper saying yes in response\n\n6:17am a couple minutes pass\n▪︎can you check if mom and [her bfs name] cuz I'm heading whispering in the hallway\n▪︎I'm not getting up and risking seeing a shadow figure pop out at me\n\nAnd that's all to record for now. Lemme know what yall think",

        "text": "When I was a teenager I was often home alone as my dad spent a lot of his time at our summer cottage with his girlfriend. I was responsible for the house and if I needed to be informed of anything my dad would call our home (landline) phone. Sometimes it would be about how to handle the fireplace on colder nights, sometimes just to ask if the house was still in working order.\n\nOne night the phone rang and instead of the normal going up the stairs to pick it up, I got a really bad feeling. Like if I picked up it was going to be really bad. Like I should NOT answer the phone. I shook the feeling away, because if my dad was calling this late it had to be important.  \nOnly, when I picked up it wasn't my dad. It was this not-a-human voice saying \"Haloo\" (which is the word we use to greet people on phone in my country).\n\nI admit to smashing the phone back onto its holder and not wasting much time to get my shoes and jacket to run out. Yeah, I apparently scare easy.\n\nFast forward 2 years. I am in my first apartment and have my own mobile phone. I was walking my brand new puppy when I got a call that went straight to voicemail. I got the same dread feeling even though it was a sunny day and I was outdoors. I played my messages and I had one from my grandma and one from \"unknown number\". I played both. The one from grandma was just normal like \"call me back when you get this\", and then when it got to the other one it was the same \"Haloo\" in a not-a-human voice that I had heard a few years ago.\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous but this is 100% true.\n\nThe only way I can describe the voice is that it was between a growl and a speaking voice.\n\nThis is something I don't tell people. Not because I am not a believer in paranormal, but because it sounds so weird. I also still don't like to be at my dad's house alone. It's a creepy circus of its own. But the phone calls still bother me, even though it's like 17 years ago.",

        "text": "The first “experience” I had here happened a few months after I moved here. I shared a room with my sister in the basement due to space issues. I was alone playing with my LPS toys when I felt a breath at the back of my neck. I thought it was my dog and turned around but there was nothing there. \n\nI turned back around to ignore it and continued playing for 5 seconds but then fight/flight/freeze kicked in, I froze for awhile then got the feeling to run so I ran upstairs to the living room.\nA month later I was cleaning up the dog toys downstairs and saw a face staring at me, so I ran upstairs and for some reason my mind decided to run back down to where it was and try to fight it, but it disappeared.\n\nI finally moved upstairs, things quieted down and I was glad to be out of that room. It was not over yet. From 3-6ish I heard a wailing sound moving through my house, at some times it sounded far away and at others it sounded right outside my door. I lay in my bed in fear  until I grew annoyed by this and marched out of bed and when I heard it again I open my door. It stopped immediately and felt like a pressure was relieved, I later asked my sibling if they heard anything and they said yes, for it kept them up too.\n\nAbout a year later for an unknown reason I started to feel unsafe around my bathroom mirror and started having dreams about it, but it stopped when I covered the mirror in my room. The blanket still lies overtop the mirror and has not been removed since it’s been put on. \n\nAsides from the sporadic disembodied body parts I’d see from the side of my eye things stopped. Until recently.\n\nI used to be able to do anything in my dreams, scary things were cartoons, I knew how scary they were supposed to be but never saw them like that. From reading to straight up asking for specific dreams while dreaming to blood coating my fingers and head and waking up with my lip bleeding. More dreams about my life and and darker themes in each dream occurring along with ominous things right before I wake up.\n\nI’ve read a contract saying \n“•you will be lost to the Mexican ocean\n•they will strangle you\n•no one will hear you scream.” With the latter being whispered into my ear during my waking moments. I’ve even gotten rules like “if you see a mirror where it shouldn’t be: run” at the other end of my hall was a new glass shelf that easily could be mistook for a mirror. \nBut I don’t think everything that could possibly be here is malicious as I’ve woken up to: when you wake up and exit your room, don’t go to the room in your left. That room was the washroom I mentioned earlier but I still went cause I almost.. ya know. \n\nI think there may spirits in my house but don’t think they are all malicious. This might just be an excuse as I do often find myself making excuses for others but I saw a younger face by my closed door watching me while I stayed up on my phone, but didn’t feel in any sort of danger so I kinda ignored it. Even so, I want to go to bed and wake up terrified of whatever may happen, what do I do?",

I felt something jump on the bed, spin around, lay down and click my leg with its tail. I turned the light on and sat up. There was nothing there. The bed was on a platform, so nowhere for anything to go under. There was no closet, and I could see everywhere in the room. The bathroom light was on and the door was cracked slightly and didn't move. I turned the light off and tried to go to sleep. About 20 minutes later, the same thing happened. I didn't turn the light on this time, I continued playing on my phone. I could feel the weight in my leg like a cat had curled up on me. After a minute or so, I moved my leg. I felt it a third time later in the night. It woke me up. I got up and went to the bathroom, came back to bed and slept through the rest of the night. The next morning, we were packing up to leave, and I was talking to my husband across the room. As we were talking, my husband's earbud case spun around once and stopped on a table a few feet from both of us. We just looked at each other, then I told my husband about the \"cat.\" He joked and said our cat probably astral projected to us from another state.",

I don't remember exactly what it was.\n\n Today I couldn't sleep all night, something woke me up and it turned out to be the earthquake in Turkey.\n\n I say that I think I perceive because on several occasions I have dreamed of things in my life that the next day or two the thing that I dreamed of or something very similar would happen.\n\n I am from Venezuela and I am 30 years old, I would like to know if this can be exploited in some way because I have also seen a girl, an old man and they really do not scare me.\n\n I don't know if I'm wrong, I just would like to know if I can help someone with my dream.",

How do we raise activism for scientific research on alleged paranormal activity and remove the stigma? Across multiple paranormal observations/studies is it possible to show a sense of repeated behavior? If ghosts/ethereal beings are real they would be the first non-human intelligence discovered a part from possible extraterrestrial life.

Last weekend I walked my dog again and went along the street which ends before the same forest entrance before which I maybe avoided a scary fate. I had to walk towards the dark entrance for a little while to reach my destination. It was dark. I knew what was lying ahead of me, but there was no other way. When I slowly walked up the small hill in my neighbourhood and were not far away from the forests edge, about 50m, I heard the same thing again. Like it had been waiting for me. In panic I sprinted away with my dog, who noticed my fear. It was all quiet after that. I stayed a friend's house. When it was later that night, I went home avoiding any small place where it could follow me unnoticed. \nToday I saw the entrance from a distance again. Nothing. But it is there. Lurking in the darkness. \nI made some effort researching what it could be, but still, I want it gone. Maybe I can set up wildlife cameras in future, maybe hunt it. If you have any advice, please tell me. Thank you.",

My sister passed out once without us even noticing, just rested of a shelf and got back up, then blacked out, shaking, and making the sound people do when having a seizure. There was one person that came to check on her, saying hes an emt and asking if we need help, and one facing about a 45°angle away but staring dirrectly where we laid my sister on the ground. No one else walking past the isle or anything. When me and my sister were walking out they stayed staring at the exact spot. Looking back at the stare, i feel very deeply unsettled. The only way i can explain is when your scared of the dark, but then you see something actually staring back, and my eyes start watering whenever i think of it.

Also I know we have physic abilities and it runs in our family, not sure if it makes entities more attracted to us.\n\nIt died down over the last few years, an odd scary occasion will happen but very very rarely, however I've been having extreme sleep paralysis for around 5 years and it's always the same entity during my sleep paralysis, now I know sleep paralysis could be something entirely different but I was convinced it wasnt and wanted to communicate to ask it to leave, stupid I know but I did an ouija board a few times as well as a communication device and the last time I got through to something I'm certain, something got moved in the room and all of the replies via the communicator was too specific for it not to be real.\n\nI asked if it was a spirit that had been in our house for a while and it said yes, I asked a few other questions and it was answering very specific and answering but sometimes messing around by replying things like ' I could be ' etc, even mentioned my brothers name when they heard him talking in another room\n\nSince then, I haven't had sleep paralysis, instead other things have been happening and it has been waking me up and preventing me from sleeping, I will hear noises in my room which will stop when I turn the light on, yesterday I turnt the light on and got back into bed to try and sleep and a few moments later I heard breathing and something blew against my back and I got a very bad feeling, I couldn't believe what had just happened.. also there wasn't a fan or anything and it didn't feel like anything that could be caused by something normal.\n\nI'm afraid to sleep now as I know what's going to happen tonight, how can I banish whatever is in my house?",

The town goes back into the 1800s, if I remember correctly. Many of the houses in my area, including the plot of land I live on, were farm land. Much of the area remains farms. We’re the original owners house owners on our specific plot. However I believe much of the area was occupied by indigenous people before European settlement.\n\nThe first of the two (my second experience in a total of 3) is identical to the one in my previous post. It was circular. This one was white with a black lining. This happened not long after my first encounter.\n\nFinally this one happened this past (2022) summer. I was driving home from work and was getting ready to turn onto a side street when I saw it. (I want to say it was within roughly 10 miles max from my house.) This black mass was vaguely helicopter shaped and off to the side of the road. The right side was a small trailer park while the side it was on was a quarry with farmland around it. \n\nAcross the street is an active air reserve base, yes. However there are only planes on said base- no helicopters. (I used to work on this air reserve base as a part of a civilian contract and can confirm there’s no helicopter activity.) This black mass was stationary and noiseless. I tried talking a picture, but either missed the shot or it disappeared by the time I got my phone out. When I looked at where it was without my phone it was gone.\n\nI have no explanations and can only speculate these were more portals.",

        "text": "hello, this is a bit of an odd story. Let me start off by getting a few things out of the way. My girlfriend is very unique. We have been dating for (almost) 5 months and before she and I got together I never saw any type of shadow people or anything really supernatural. I have never even seen the fabled hat man that so many other people claim to see. Well after we got together things got a little weird. \n\nThis may sound a little fucked up but before her i never really cared much for other people, I never really felt any sympathy or care for anyone, but that only applies to other people, I've always felt compassion and had a love for animals, but never any other people until after i met my girlfriend. Not only that, but the amount of weird things that have happened, lets call them 'incidents'. The number of incidents we've had in these past 5 months has been quite ridiculous. Let me list a few examples; if we are out and about and we both see someone fall over, we will both say the exact same thing, at the exact same time, in the exact same way. Almost in a machine-like robotic manner. Its very odd. We finish each others sentences all the time, and we both just seem to know when something is wrong with the other. Not just in person, but over text as well. I've also noticed that whenever we are together I always see two crows. Every time we go out to eat, go to the mall, or go outside to smoke theres always two crows, and when Im not with her I only ever see one crow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I need to get something else out of the way, my girlfriend has a personality disorder. Its not super severe but it is there. This is important for the story im about to tell. One day i fell asleep on her chest while she was rubbing her hands through my hair. I started dosing off and then realized I was falling asleep and I wanted to have a lucid dream, and the last thing i remember before falling asleep was just thinking my girlfriends name in my head. Now onto the dream itself. A golden light slowly approached me from the darkness and enveloped my entire body. I blinked and I was sitting at my desk in my room.  I was on a facetime call with her and she tells me \"Babe watch out behind you\" and i look down at my phone and in the window where I can see myself i see me and a jet black female figure standing right behind me. When i laid eyes on this figure I was filled with the most gut wrenching anxiety and fear. I could feel nothing but misery and malevolence radiating from this figure. I don't think, in my 18 years of life, that i've ever felt malice and horror like i felt in this dream. After I saw it i tried spinning around to confront it and i fell out of my chair. As i fell everything was ripped away from me similar to how it had enveloped me but about 10 times as fast. At this point everything around me was pitch black and i could still feel the anxiety and fear but to a far lesser degree. I thought i was dead. I started thrashing around as hard as i could and then i woke up filled with adrenaline and horror. My girlfriend was obviously freaked out, and i recounted the events above to her. She then told me that the golden light was significant to one of her personalities and that the shadowy figure was also significant. I should also note that I had only been asleep for about 30 minutes at this point. After talking things out with her, we came to the conclusion that i had peered inside of her head, and her hands were the connection point, but I have almost zero experience or knowledge when it comes to the supernatural implications of dreams so take what i said there very lightly. This happened about a month ago ( January 6, 2023)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next two incidents happened back to back, one day after another. I'll start with Friday (Feb 3 2023). We were coming home on the city bus and i snatched her a balloon from one of the bus stops. We ended up getting home, and i tied the balloon to the chair at my desk (same one i fell out of in the dream) and then laid down on the bed with my girlfriend. After a while i opened my eyes and saw a black thing come into the corner of my eye. It filled me with adrenaline and horror, yet again, and when i did a double take it was just the balloon. But when it happened it didn't feel like it was the balloon, when i saw it it was black, and the balloon was red. Not only that but the balloon was far enough away from my bed that from the angle i was looking up at the ceiling i wouldn't have been able to see the balloon in my peripherals. The black thing i saw came almost directly over top of me. \n\nNow for Feb 4th 2022 (yesterday). I was in my backyard smoking, it was probably around 11 or 12 at night, and I felt like i was being watched from behind, it was almost like the axious feeling i had but not nearly as bad. After a minute or so my dog comes outside through the doggy door and almost immediatly the feeling went away. Normally I would brush all of these encounters off as me being a schizo stoner (thats a joke), but the thing thats making me write this out tonight is that when my dog came outside he was staring into the direction i felt i was being watched from with his ears perked up. Not only that, but the incident in January happened right around a full moon, and now these incidents are happening right around a full moon. If anyone could help me at all with any information or any similar experiences please do, I'm kind of freaking out now, I didn't realize the thing about the full moons until Im at the very end of this post, and its scaring me a little.",

        "text": "In my life I've always had these strange feelings about certain people in the world. I've had a number of people come into my life acting as friends, sometimes I know these people for years but there's this piece of me that thinks something doesn't feel right. Eventually they would show their true colors and I would think, that's strange, somehow I always knew. This doesn't go for everyone, before you think that, it's usually only very specific people with a strange vibe to them.\n\nCome to find, my mom told me she was told by her priest as a child that she possessed a special gift of seeing the good and evil in others, I laughed this off because I'm not only agnostic, but also a skeptic who doesn't believe in the idea of good and evil. Only, as years go by I start to reconsider that notion a bit more. I'm neither a believer or a non-believer in the paranormal, I simply don't think it's my place to state as fact the unknown in the universe.\n\nI recently found out from my mom's side of the family that we apparently have quite a history of this sort of thing, dating all the way back to my Great-Great-Great Grandmother. My family on that side comes from Eastern Europe, and apparently Great Grandma had been quite renown in her town for her ability to predict crop cycles, weather, and mundane occurrences such as arrests or births.\n\nI also have a history of strange dreams and occurrences. One of these dreams was a few years ago, was so mundane, but was one of the most positive feelings I had ever felt in my life, I swear it was so vivid. I was holding hands with a man, walking through a supermarket aisle. I can remember him so vividly, I had never seen him before. Curly black hair, wore a black hoodie, he was taller than me but only just, I couldn't see his face, it's like he was hiding it from me, almost just out of view. He made me feel so safe, I felt like he was everything to me. We were holding hands walking through a supermarket. It was the strangest experience, as I woke up I felt devastated, like I had been taken away from this powerful, beautiful feeling. I had never felt such a powerful dream, even my worst nightmares. I just wanted to be back with him, even though I had no idea who he was. It genuinely sent me into a depression for awhile.\n\nThis past year, I swear I met this man. Turns out he worked at a grocery store, lived near one, and one of the first places we went together was this grocery store. I felt that same feeling I felt in that dream with him, when I touched his hands it's like I remembered them, when I met him it's like I knew him and he knew me. Somehow, I fumbled it and we had a falling out recently, but I still feel deep down that he's my soulmate. I had never believed in soulmates until I met him.\n\nAnother oddity, is my childhood cat. I remember distinctly and vividly, growing up I had an orange, pudgy tabby cat named Coho like the salmon. I loved this cat, he used to perch himself on the back of a very specific floral sofa we owned, just under a window in the sunlight. I would turn towards him and stroke him, he was lazy, silly, he had such a distinct smell. I asked my mom what happened to this cat, as by that point it had hit me I had no memory of him dying or running away, I specifically asked about him by name. My mom told me that cat died three years before I was born when he got hit by a car, I never had a pet cat, and asked how I even knew about him and his name as neither of my parents liked to talk about him. None of us can explain why I remember this cat, I can still remember him, and I haven't really interacted with any cats in my life, to this day I still have not owned or lived with any cats.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some insight with what all this means? I don't know much about any of this but some of these things keep me up at night.",

She was born with her gift as it's passed thru my family line. But lately her gift has been ramping up. Her normal ghost has become more worrisome to her. He has become more solid and she says he stands and stares at her at night. She mentioned he has golden colored hair now and it was dull before. The new ghost really scares her, she says it's a girl or woman ghost who crouches in front of her closet with long hair in it's face and cries but never lifts is head or says anything. Both ghost have been waking her up during the night and she is too scared to fall asleep. We've been hearing talking in her room when she isn't home and I've caught glimpses of the man ghost many times over the years but right now the whole vibe of the house feels off. I've tried to set barriers in our home and have been successful but right now the usual stuff isn't working. Any advice on what these things are or how to rid ourselves of them would be appreciated. I'm just a mom trying to protect my kid.",

As I was doing this, another dime fell on the back of my head.\n\nI looked around the top of the shower area again, and couldn’t find any more. I finished my shower anticipating more dimes, but there were no more. Afterwards, I looked at the three dimes and saw the years : 2010, 2015 and 2020.   Perhaps there was a ghost. Or, perhaps I placed three dimes in a 5 year sequential order on top of my shower door which fell on me while I showered when I bumped the side of the door. The latter is the most likely imho, but could it have been a ghost? What say you?",

It started when I was around 12 when my mother actually mentioned to me first that she heard a lot of banging/Clanging in my room in the middle of the night  which she then came in to yell at me for not being in bed asleep but she then seen I was fully asleep and that happened nearly every night, After that when we moved houses I was around 13/14 years old when I was being actually physically hurt like being hit, my hair slightly pulled, hitting my mirrors, Tugging on the side of my bed sheets and touching my hand and even scratching my floor and all of this would happen just as I was in that stage of being half awake and nearly falling into a deep sleep, I than began to have sleep paralysis and with it I’d have nightmares with a person in a black cloak moving very fast but they had no face or I’d be in a sleep paralysis and a man would be talking to me. I told my mum just because she had an ongoing experience where she’d see a black hooded figure just before it paralysis’s her. \n\nI don’t know what to think about this other than it’s a bad spirit but I’m interested to hear others opinions or stories!",

        "text": "Do you believe in the paranormal? Whenever people ask me that question all I can think about is this two part story that I love to tell because I find it to be just downright unexplainable. I’m going to try to keep this as concise as possible but fair warning- it’s going to be lengthy. \n\nIt was around 1:00 am on a weeknight in December. My roommate Jason, friend Jack and girlfriend at the time Vic, had all been hanging out. Being oddly warm for a winter night (around 60 degrees) we decided to take a walk around. On a limb we tried the door to the FA building and to our surprise it was open. (It was during the exam period.) So we went in there to find that the door that lead to the costume storage room (which was effectively a basement) was also unlocked. Curiosity got the best of us and we headed down into the cold cemented crypt. (Except for Vic, she made the right choice.) Upon reaching the bottom of the staircase, there was long stretch of clothing on hangers that seemed to go on forever. We then looked to the side of us to see a door that said “keep shut at all times”… Now obviously we were gonna open the door, I mean come on! So we opened the door and peeked in just to some pipes running across the top of a longer hall, a pile of logs to our right and another door to our left. Unimpressed we closed it and proceeded down to the end of the hall of hanging clothing. Underwhelmed to started to head back but then my friend Jason made one last interjection: “I kinda wanna check that side room again.” So we did. And as I’m holding the door that shouldn’t be open, I realize something. “Wait, nah. Hell no. I’ve seen way too many horror movies to allow this door to slam shut behind me. Jason grab me that piece of wood.” Jason was just looking at me like an idiot so I said it more aggressively: “Jason grab me that piece of WOOD!” Like a deer in headlights he didn’t move, so I said it again: “JASON GRAB ME THAT PEICE OF-“ suddenly the side door flies open on a gust of aggressive wind! We hear a SLAM in the distance and then we fucking book it! After we get out Jason claims he heard a girls voice as he went up the stairs. Eager to share our findings with the group we did just that and returned the next night with a large group. Scared as I was, I had my doubts about what happened and wanted to see if I could debunk this phenomenon. I checked the side door that flew open to realize that it didn’t have a hatch that fully closed… so that was that… it was most likely just a draft that came from the wide open stage above that caused the door to open. I returned with relief… but I was also kind of let down- I thought, wouldn’t it be nice to have a ghost story of my own? \n\nWell it turns out I would get exactly what I wished for. The next day I was on aid duty for my best friend and roommate Bryce (he’s physically disabled so he needs someone to help him with everyday tasks) and we were chilling in his room after we had just told his dad about my adventure. Mid conversation we hear a faint three toned whistle. “Did you hear that?” Bryce asked. I assured him it was nothing but a bird or a gust of wind. But then it happened again. Bryce insisted we get out of his room and head to the living room. I wasn’t convinced it was anything out of the ordinary but I didn’t want him to be tweaking, so we did just that. We set up our computers and headphones and got started on the work that we had been procrastinating. I could tell Bryce was pissed at me so I figured I should just keep my mouth shut and continue doing my work. The three toned whistle returned… right in my ear. I played back my music to double check… only percussion. Reluctantly I informed Bryce. To which is responded with full curiosity against his better judgment. “OKAY THAT’S IT IF YOU’RE HERE- FUCKING WHISTLE!” 3, 2, 1… the three toned whistle returned as if it was in the room with us. We booked it out our dorm to the lobby. Soon our other roommate returned confirming that he was not in his room. We knocked on neighbors doors to test how well a whistle could travel- it wasn’t audible. I have no explanation for what happened. The whistle happened a few more times that night but never again after. I’m fairly certain I brought something back from the night prior, but I’m\nnot sure what it could have been trying to tell me. Any one know anything about spirits that whistle?",

        "text": "When I was a kid my little sister and I were visiting my dad, my older brother and sister (that lived with him), his new wife and her kids (two girls and a boy) in a small country town in southern Western Australia called Manjimup. \n\nThere was only three bedrooms in the house, two at the front of the house and one at the back. My dad and his wife were in one of the front rooms and my brother and step brother were in the other which left the last room at the very back of the house away from the others for us 5 girls. \n\nThis first night we were there it was a very hot summer's night and the house didnt have any air conditioning so being too hot to sleep we were sitting on our beds just talking and catching up since it had been a few months since we had seen each other. We had opened the bedroom window to catch the small breeze that was blowing in hopes of cooling the room down so we could eventually sleep somewhat comfortably. \n\nSo we were still chatting and giggling away around 1am and the rest of the household seemed to be sound asleep when suddenly my big sister Sandy told us all to be quiet and listen, when we did we all heard what I can only describe as a very loud rubber band being snapped over and over again. It sounded like it was on a loud speaker and what was even weirded was all the other night sounds had stopped and the breeze was gone. It was so still apart from this rubber band noise. We started whispering to each other about what it could be but really couldn't explain it. Sandy decided we should go outside and see if we could see what it was since it sounded so close (stupid kids I know!) We all agreed and headed out into the back yard. \n\nOnce there the sound seemed to get louder for just a minute then it started to fade away or even kinda move towards the front of the house.The back yard joined to the driveway without any fence or gate so without saying anything to each other we all kinda just started following the sound down the driveway (I honestly don't know why).\n\nOnce we were out the front of the house the sound suddenly stopped and it was completely still for just a second then a baby started crying somewhere out passed the front yard on the other side of the road which was bushland (at least when we talked about it later this is where we agreed that it sound like it was coming from) again we followed but when we got into the middle of the road it started sounding like it was coming from all around us. My little sisters wanted to go back inside but Sandy was worried one of our neighbour's toddlers had got out onto the road somehow, i dont know why this made sense to us but we started walking up and down the road a few hundred meters each way looking for any baby or toddler in the drainage ditches on either side of the road or the edge of the bush but we never seemed to get any closer or further away from the crying.\n\nAfter a few minutes the crying just stopped and again there was silence. We all stopped in out tracks and just looked at each other, I was holding my breath but after a couple of seconds all the normal night sounds and the breeze just started again like nothing had happened. Suddenly we were all scared shitless and ran home as fast as we could not stopping until we were back in bed and my sister Sandy had slammed the window closed.\n\nAfter a little bit we were able to kinda shake off what had happened and go back to talking but we never turned off the light or opened the window again that night. We also didnt get much sleep.\n\nFor the rest of our visit we never opened that window at night no matter how hot it was which made our dad finally go buy a fan for the room and we also brought in a lamp that we kept on all night just make us feel a little better.\n\nMy dad, step mum and brothers never woke up and never heard anything like what we did so kinda dismissed what we said had happened apart from telling us off for leaving the house, i think they thought we had just scared oursleves telling spooky stories or something.We never heard either noise again and my dad moved the family to another house about 6 months later so we eventually stopped talking about it.\n\nThis happened when I was 12 or 13, I'm 43 now and to this day I have no idea what the original sound was from, why we felt like we needed to follow it or if the baby crying was even related to it but when I think about it I still get freaked out. Anyone have any ideas on how to explain my experience or even just what the rubber band noise might have been?",

She gave me the parts, like the joysticks, memory cards, games, cables, the console etc. and i put everything on the living room table. i took the av cable, put it on the table first, went back to get the joysticks and when i got back to the living room… the cable was gone. my grandma was still in the bedroom. she wouldn’t do shit like this to mess with me but she also didn’t even have the chance to do so in the timeframe of like… 20 seconds.\n\nAny explanation? Also let me know if there is a more fitting subreddit for this",

This happened at 1:45 am today morning, I was in my room on a call with my gf, and out of nowhere from the corner of my eye I see a very bright light just whizz by me in my room from one end to another, it had a distinct sound as if almost a train just passed by me, and I had my bag and other lighter items just randomly shake as if someone just run by really quick. (Note: I did not have my fan on so there was basically no air circulating, thus why I'm feeling so perplexed. I also happen to live in an apartment.) Hope someone has some sensible explanation as to why this happened or how it happened.",

        "text": "TL;DR I had two brown pants inducing moments of the potentially paranormal.\n\nExperience 1: \nI (26 M) have had what i believe is is either two paranormal experiences or maybe my mind playing tricks on me. I shall explain further in details to the best of my memory.\n\nWhen I was in year 9 around 15 years of age around 2011-ish I was staying up late on a Saturday night. I was chilling in the lounge watching comedy central on tv under a blanket. (it was winter in NZ) Around midnight as I was watching tv I saw what resembled a young boy with a bowl styled hair cut. And what I can assume is eyeless sockets just pop out by the front door which was maybe 10 feet from where I was sitting.\n\nI won't deny my heart was wearing its brown pants that night I slowly got up. Wrapped my duvet around like it was going to protect me then the little bastard disappeared in front if my eyes. I proceeded to basically put the light switch through the wall as. I turned the lounge light on for \"protection\" I slowly peeked around the corner to see if he was still there nope he was gone. I'm not sure why but i slowly searched the house looking for him as my family slept I found nothing.\n\nThe next day as I was in the lounge with my family i saw in the corner of. My eye at the end if the hallway the same little boy go from what was our wash house walk into what was our cupboards. (yes a full body apparition) I told my mother who was sitting next to me about she told me she saw him a few days prior and had invited him into the lounge. We moved shortly a few months after that.\n\nExperience 2:\nAround  covid my family and I had to move from a house we lived in for nearly ten years because the landlords were selling it. Again i was watching tv late at night and decided to go to bed around 1 am I walked to where my room was at the.\n\nEnd of the house in total darkness (I knew the layout of the house like the back of my hand) as. I turned to go into my room I bumped into a shadow of a person that was the kind of darkness that would make the blackest of blacks. \n\nLook like a freshly painted white wall the thing that was odd is this shadow person was taller than i for context im 6'2\" and weighed 90kg then.\n\nI for some reason apologized for bumping into said \"shadow person\" saying \"sorry mate\" not thinking maybe said shadow person could have been a person who entered the house unlawfully. \nAfter said realization hit my heart put on its brown pants again but.\n\nI wasn't as brave to go looking for said shadow person on this encounter and proceeded to hide in my bed under the covers like the bfg that I am.",

        "text": "When I was a kid, my mom and I lived with my grandparents in their 3 story house. It had a basement a ground floor and a second floor, to give context there was a living room directly in front of the stairs leading upstairs so you could see my moms room on the left (important for later) and my grandparents room on the right. My room was further down the second story hall, but I spent a lot of time alone and with my uncle in the basement; for more context the basement was a huge rectangle with one room directly to the left of the stairs (my uncles room) and one room in the far back left corner (storage room also important for later) with context out of the way time for the actual story.\n\nThis all happened when I was 8 or 9 can’t remember exactly it was around when halo 3 came out, the first time it happened is honestly the worst, I was home “sick” from school (in reality I just wanted to play halo bro) but everyone in the house worked so I was alone and my uncle was at school, the only Xbox in the house was in the basement. So naturally when everyone left I got up and went to go play halo, I’m down there for a few hours playing games happily and all of a sudden the storage room I mentioned earlier creeks open ever so slightly, not completely just enough to see a slit of darkness and plain as day, I hear my mom call me from what sounded like the furthest corner of the storage room saying she needed help putting something away. My\nMom wasn’t home at the time and I knew this, I didn’t turn anything off I bolted upstairs and laid on the couch until my uncle got home from school. He asked why I left the Xbox on and he thought I was sick and laughed at me I just laughed back and said “my bad won’t happen again.”\n\nThe only other time this happened was actually during a family dinner we had cousins and pretty much our entire family over for a holiday my cousins and I were playing with nerf guns in the living room they got hungry and went to get more food so I sat by myself in the living room reloading my magazines with darts when something caught my eye upstairs (same year as last encounter I’m still 8 or 9 In this scenario.) it was my moms room door, it had opened and because It was like 8 pm it was dark upstairs because no one was up there so no lights were on but my mom had walked out from the darkness and kind of waved me over to her with a weird smile on her face. I yelled to her “why?” And she just kept waving me over, but I clearly saw my mom so I didn’t question her again and started walking over but as I got to the start of the stairs I looked to my right and saw my mom talking with my aunt at the dinner table so I walked over and asked if she had been upstairs and she said no, went back to the living room looked up the stairs and her doors was closed again. \n\nNothing like that ever happened again but it still gives me the chills when I think about it.",

When I was 15 years old, my family and I moved to a new house, and on the first day, we heard three big stomps from upstairs, and to our surprise, no one was their. Immediately, my mom had the home cleansed, and after that, nothing weird happened. About a year later, after my 16th birthday, I began to have the most vivid and terrifying dreams. There were so many nights I woke up screaming in sweats . I kid you not. I had nightmares every single night, and it got so bad that I dreaded going to sleep. To be simply put, I was afraid to close my eyes. These dreams were always about ghosts, demons, and witches tormenting me. I didn't tell my family and kept this to myself. Then, not long after, I was having premonitions. One time, I chased a shadow into my brothers room, thinking it was him, but to my surprise their was no one their, my brother was playing outside. I don't know if this is of importance, but I became suicidal during that time, and I remember clearly I was going to take my life, but I fell asleep and had a dream about meeting God, we had a conversation on the roof of my house, I don't remember his face or our conversation only that he convinced me not to take my life that day. This was the only dream I had during that year that wasn't a nightmare. None of my family members experienced anything odd during our time in that house. It was only me, which made me believe that maybe I was cursed or something. After 2 or 3 years, i finally moved. After leaving, I rarely had any nightmares and no premonitions again. What are your thoughts.",

        "text": "I've had a few experiences, one of which was very vivid and I have no \"logical\" explanation for it. But I'm still fairly skeptical, maybe foolishly and doggedly so. But my skepticism is beginning to wane a little bit.\n\nI recently experienced three things that I can't explain, the last one just happened and it affected me enough to actually want to get on here and post about it (I didn't even know this side of reddit existed until I searched for it just a few minutes ago).\n\n* Anyway, about three weeks ago, I was sitting on our chez lounge late one night when I saw a reflection on our TV (which was off). The reflection was subtle, but showed something dark and obscure moving slowly in the kitchen. I watched it for maybe 5-10 seconds and then whipped my head around to see what the heck it was. Of course, nothing was there and when I turned back around nothing was moving.\n* The second was about a week-and-a-half ago. I was carrying a pair of pants into my bedroom one night. My wife was sleeping in the bed and the lights were off, so it was dark and I couldn't see much. The pants leg dangling near my shin seemed to get caught on something; I felt something give it a little tug, but I didn't think much of it. I put the pants in the hamper and turned on a light, but there was nothing on the floor for them to catch onto. The pull was significant enough for me to stop and reorient and pull back myself.\n* But tonight was by far the strangest and creepiest thing. I got home late from hanging out at my family's place and I parked my blue car in our apartment complex garage. It's well-lit and not all that creepy, in my opinion. Our second car (red) is across the garage and I walked over to it to get something I'd left in the back seat, pushing the button to lock the blue car. I grabbed what I needed from the red car and began walking to the gate to lead to our apartment when I saw the trunk of the blue car slam shut. It was loud and clear, too. I stopped in my tracks and watched for about twenty seconds to make sure no one was going to leap out and attack. I then walked over, looked under the car and then looked all around it, but no one was there.\n\nThere aren't any buttons that I could have pressed to cause it. None of them open or close the trunk. It was closed when I parked, too. It was one of those cameras in the back to guide you where to park, so I know I didn't accidentally open it. And there's no way to close it from the inside, so I know no one was hiding inside when the trunk closed.\n\nI consider myself pretty brave and confident and still fairly skeptical. But that's pretty hard for me to explain away and it sure was creepy. I actually grabbed a weapon from my car when I went to investigate. Anyway, thought I'd share this new experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, also, I mentioned that I've experienced other things in my past. These are generally a while back and not very common. I don't normally consider myself one of those people who sees, hears, or experiences paranormal stuff. But not sure what seems to be going on now. : (",

I figured it was my friend needing something. I couldn’t really see much cus I just woke up and it was dark, so I walked down the hallway over to my friend who was lying down on the couch awake. I asked something along the lines of “why did you tap me and why are you still awake?” What she said sent the chilliest chills down my spine. She looked at me and her eyes widened and said “I couldn’t sleep because I felt something tap my shoulder and it woke me up” \n\nSo yeah. I guess my new place is haunted.",

        "text": "This story is a little hard to talk about, I've talked about it once but didn't wanna get into it much but thought maybe I should start from the beginning with those 2 orbs. I was only about 11 years old at the time, I had lived down the street from 2 other kids around the same age. I had been to their house many times before and had never experienced something so vivid. But either way I'm about 11 years old and the season outside was fall, I ran down the street to see if me and my friends would be able to hang out. I reach their home and knock on the door, their parents answer and proceed to let me inside. Now for everyone wondering what the set up to this looked like I'll do my best to keep the description but this was over 10 years ago and their house was honestly a disaster. So as I entered the door I'd step into the kitchen, as I stepped through I could smell something burning, it was strong smelling never smelling it before it hit me strong. Not knowing I figured I'd just ask one of my friends, but I stopped before reaching their living room because above their kitchen table I was seeing 2 orbs circling around each. Almost as if they were in fight for control of the house or just constantly in motion but you could see them vividly as they spun around in circles at each other. I couldn't help but stare in amazement from never seeing something so interesting. So I turn through this sheet they have in the doorway of their home into the living room. Sitting on the couch were both my friends playing Halo on the Xbox. I sat near them on the couch and asked them what had been burning and they told me sage, at that time I had no idea what it was but the smell was growing on me but years later my future friend would actually tell me what sage is used for. So after a few mins of watching them play I asked what with the weird light in the kitchen? 1 is black and 1 is white, I'm trying my best to describe what I saw to them as I came inside. They look at each other and a friend says to me that it actually isn't the first time this has happened. As we are all talking about the orbs somehow they made their way through the sheet in the doorway to the living room from the kitchen. But at that point it didn't seem like they were seeing it or letting it bother them but I kept my eyes on them until it got late and I was already given permission to stay there that night. As I began to head towards the bedroom which was back through the kitchen I accidentally ran through the orbs, nothing happened at first. But about 5 mins after walking through the kitchen into my friends room I went to turn on their tv. As I went to turn it on I heard this loud snarling then bark in my ear, I turned around and my friends were still on the bed. I asked if they heard that dog bark and they responded what dog? I said come on y'all didn't hear a dog just now, like you guys didn't just bark in my ear? Again they responded but confused no we don't even own an animal, also I already knew since that wasn't my first time there but I just really needed to know. After the first bark about an hour went by before I would hear it again snarling and barking at me that night. This would happen about 3 times that night. After that night my thoughts on the paranormal have forever been open and I'm curious to know more. But that was my first experience into the paranormal. Question how would someone go about documenting these paranormal events but with little to no budget? I want to try and debunk this small ash that seems to follow me for the past 5 years and now my girlfriend is starting to see it. Any ideas from anyone?",

        "text": "My whole life growing up, I always knew I would die in my mid 20's.  I got lots of credit cards and maxed them out just living life because I knew I would die at 25.  Long story short, I did.  \n\nI was 25 and on an aircraft carrier in the middle east and needed emergency surgery.  The anesthesiologist who was supposed to be a member of my surgical team was supposed to fly off the day before, but due to the weather he stuck around and was part of the surgical team. \n\nI was in the navy and lived on and worked on an old ship where many people died.  There are stories of course, whatever.  I never thought anything of it.  We worked 12 hour on shifts and 12 hours off.  We often would sneak away during our 12 on to nap in certain areas of the ship.    \n\nSo I needed surgery, an appendectomy, and they didn't know this at the time, nor did I, but I also have Malignant Hyperthermia.  It is a very rare genetic disorder where anesthesia kills you.  The guy who was supposed to fly off but didn't, recognized it right away and reversed it.    \n\n\nAccording to them, I technically died for over 2 minutes but was revived.    \n\n\nAfter then, I started seeing every fucking ghost on that ship.  The place we used to go sleep, I never could cause that was the place the spirits all died and they would reach out to me.  I never went back there.  It didn't stop there.  More to come.  I don't want to make this post too long and piss people off.",

        "text": "Okay so let me start off by saying that whilst I am open to the the idea of the paranormal and ‘spiritual’ aspects of the world, I am by no means a believer and try to find a rational explanation for claims made by people surrounding these subjects. However, I have an experience from when I was around 4-8ish that I thought you may all like.\n\nMy parents often retell it to me as they think it is strange too, but it happened at the end of a shopping trip. They were checking out and I was playing near the window a few feet away when I saw a man staring at me. He was really distinctive; really short and he seemed to be furious. There was also a woman with him who seemed to be like a carer for him looking back. As they were walking away he threw a stone at my face which of course hurt like hell and made me cry. My parents then came to me and saw I had a large red mark across my cheek, but looked around and saw no man like this.\n\nNow I was young, my memory of it is really fuzzy and I don’t really know if what I remember is the incident or what I told my parents. But who tf throws a stone at a child. I know this could break the rules as it could be explained as just being a guy; if so I’ll remove. It really creeps us all out and thought it would be fun to share.\n\nEdit: As I’m writing this my dog started shaking and ran away. Im done with ghosts I’ve said too much lmao",

        "text": "This was about 20 years ago, in an apartment in San Diego, which was a new build.  I lived there with my GF for about a year, then we broke up, she moved out and a friend moved in cause he needed a place to crash for a few months, and I could use the help on the rent.  We'll call him Z.    \n\n\nI had a fold-out couch Z was staying on and Z wasn't working.  So he would pretty much watched TV all day or played video games while I was at work.  In the evenings we partied, too much.  Z would always complain that he couldn't sleep and would always find himself awake in the middle of the night staring up at one corner of the room.  I never thought of this cause alcohol and drugs mess with everything so I was like, whatever, you're going to bed black-out drunk every night.  \n\nSo I had a DVD player with no buttons on it, you had to use the remote to control anything besides turning it on or off.  Z bought Lost on DVD (that's how old this story is), and he yelled out, \"Hey, I'm gonna start watching this,\" and I said let me know when it is loaded up and I'll come out.  A half-hour passed and I went out to find the place a mess.  Long story short he couldn't find the remote.  We then collectively tore that place apart.  We spent nearly 2 hours looking everywhere for the remote.  Since we drank a lot we even checked our cars, the dishwasher, and pockets in jeans that were in laundry baskets; literally everywhere.  Since Z was staying on a pull-out couch/bed we, of course, took that all apart and it wasn't there.    \n\n\nAt this point, we felt defeated and agreed to go buy a new DVD player to watch Lost.  We put the house back together and were sitting on the couch side by side, and I knew it was a long shot but I thought, I didn't check the freezer (even though we checked the fridge). So I said, \"hey, let me check one last place\".  Went to the freezer- not there.  I went back to him and the fucking remote was on the couch exactly where I was sitting when I got up 20 seconds before to go to the freezer.  Z was on his laptop right next to it the whole time.  I picked it up and said, \"dude, where did you find it?\"  and he looked at me and turned white.  We both ran outside and flipped out for about 45 minutes.\n\nOver the period of the next few weeks, stuff that carries electrical charges went missing.  Electric razor chargers, phone chargers, MP3 player chargers, and laptop cables.  Z moved out on a weekday while I was at work.  The room he was staying in was empty besides the furniture.  When I got home from work, all those cables were in a corner of the room.  I know this wasn't him fucking with me cause he made me mail a few to him. \n\nSo once Z moved out, for some reason, I couldn't sleep in my own bed and I could only sleep on the couch.  Almost every night I would wake up sitting up on the couch staring at one upper corner of the room, just as he said he did.  \n\nWhere I worked, once a month I would have to work a late shift.  As such, I got home at around 7 am, crashed on the couch, and at around 10 am I woke up and there was an old man standing in front of me about 4 ft away.  I played it off as if I was just tired and dreaming, but I stared at him for about a minute and realized I was awake.  He wasn't dressed like an old man either.  He was wearing a t-shirt, sneakers with socks that went to his calves, and a baseball cap.  After about 3 minutes, he, in an unnatural way, turned to look at me, made eye contact, then took a few steps and disappeared.  I flipped the fuck out and while I planned to move outta there in 2 weeks, was gone in a few days.  \n\nI have many more stories like this, but this one carries the most weight so I wanted to share it with the sub while I was on my computer and could type.",

        "text": "I moved to a new house in 2014 with my parents, my grandpa and my cat. We spent almost 10 years renovating it. Bought it when i was just a little girl. It was unfinished when we bought it because the owner killed himself in the house after his wife left with his children. In 2019 my dad died unexpectedly at 49. Left us all heartbroken. I was 19 at the time. In 2021 my grandpa died. On Monday my cat died. So every 2 years somebody who lives in this house dies. I’m starting to wonder if there’s something wrong with this house like really bad energy that makes everyone die? We also do not get along with our neighbors. Used to be good friends but my dad got in a dispute about land and they’ve hated us ever since. After my grandpa died we found a joker card in one of the flower pots infront of the house. Is it part of some kind of black magic spell? Is somebody trying to hurt us or trying to get us to leave the house? The neighbors definitely want us gone. I burned the card immediately. Who would put something like this in our flower pot and why?",
