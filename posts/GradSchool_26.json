        "text": "I'm trying to figure out if it's normal to hate grad school this much or if I'm really not cut out for academia. Also just need to vent a little.\n\nI'm in the last semester of my Masters, hoping to graduate in May if all goes as planned. Everyone keeps asking me if/when I'm going to get my PhD and it's driving me nuts. I keep telling them absolutely not right now, I need a break from school. But I'm also worried that I won't be able to find a job I like if I don't. (I have a Master's in plant biology - I'm worried that I'll be over qualified for tech jobs but under qualified for higher up R&amp;D jobs, as it seems many of them are looking for PhD.)\n\nI actually don't mind the work I do in grad school. Sure it can be a lot and stressful, but I genuinely enjoy doing research, and I feel self-motivated to do my work for the most part as it's rewarding to see results. I also TA'd for a few semesters which was exhausting on top of my research and classes but still not the worst. I enjoyed it to an extent.\n\nWhat I do hate though is the culture of grad school. I hate attending seminars, I hate going to conferences, I hate having to sit through lab meetings when we have nothing productive to talk about, or going to lab meeting just to discuss some paper I had to read that isn't related to my research, when I could be using that time to do my own work. Everyone else around me seems to enjoy these things and even get excited about them. The people in my labs are nice and I do like them, but they are so work-oriented that I can't relate to them. I like my work, but I also love my hobbies and enjoy playing music, making art, the outdoors... none of my coworkers seem to have passion for much outside of their research. When I talk about the things I enjoy, I feel like they stare at me as if I have 3 heads. I'm also the only queer person that I know of in all of the labs I collaborate with. I know it's probably a personal problem of just not relating to the people I work with, but I go to a pretty large university and the sterile workaholic culture seems to run rampant here. I haven't been able to find any close friends since I moved here. Part of me is worried that I'll run into this problem anywhere I work, but I just feel so out of place here and I'm holding onto the thought that I'll find a community one day with more of \"my people\". I guess I'm wondering if what I experience is normal in academia or if it's just the school/department I go to? Does anyone else feel this way? This is also a large part of why I don't want to continue on to a PhD, even though I might otherwise enjoy it.\n\nSide note... maybe I'm just an introvert, but does anyone actually enjoy attending seminars and going to conferences???",

Before I get into the details, I'll provide a bit of background.\n\nI'm currently a second and final year MSc Biology (2 yrs) international student in the Netherlands, and the way my program is designed, each year I am supposed to find an internship in order to progress and eventually graduate. The university recommends us to do the first internship in-house, meaning under the Faculty of Science and your respective department, only then for the second/last internship you get to choose to do the internship in a company or another university (company or university can be locally or internationally, students have the option). \n\nI successfully completed my first internship already back in September 2022 and ever since then have been stuck in a hole trying to find an internship here in western Europe. I have tried companies locally and several neighboring countries as well as universities (across the Netherlands) but my efforts have proven to be fruitless thus far. Companies either do not reply or that they are not hiring during this period. In the meantime, I have just been calling and sending emails on a daily basis, even spoke to my program/study advisor who gave me useful advice and suggestions but still nothing to show. Hell, I have even tried approaching/connecting with potential employers via Linkedin after receiving such advice but apparently for some I require the premium package, which I do not have, in order to send them a message\n\nI feel like a failure because it's now January 2023 and due to my internship being a mandatory 6-month period in order to get the credits, this all means that I will definitely be graduating late. That, in turn, means more burden on my parents to financially support me. I just don't know what to do when the companies and the people I send my emails to do not reply at all.",

I want to get a Ph.D. degree in biology area (epigenetics, oncology, bioinformatics..) and become a professor in the future. I currently received both master's offers and three Ph.D. interview invitations. Would anyone give me suggestions about directly going to Ph.D. or getting into a master's program, then applying to the Ph.D. program?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI received a master's offer from an ivy league and Ph.D. interview invitations (top 80 in the overall ranking and 30 in the biology ranking). I love three Ph.D. universities, and both of them have great professors. However, the Ivy League is hard to reject, especially since I think I can apply for a better-ranking Ph.D. program after getting a master's degree. I understand that PI is more important in the graduate study than university ranking. However, I found that most of my current university professors are graduates from top universities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTuition for a master's program is acceptable, and I don't really care about wasting two years on a master's because I think the experience in my master, especially if I might have a project and publication, will boost my future Ph.D. application. However, my current PI (I really admire my PI) suggests I go to a Ph.D. program because a master's program is kind of useless, and I might not successfully apply to better Ph.D. programs than my current one. I want to hear more suggestions. I really appreciate any suggestions",

I've been out of school for 6 years and have been at the same job ever since.\n\nI'm thinking of reaching out to an old practicum supervisor (whom I also took an elective under) to be an academic reference. Although I know they'll remember me and that I was \"good\" overall, but they might not remember details of what I was like. Here are my concerns:\n\n* Assuming I'm able to gather enough data for my practicum supervisor to write specifics, is it a red flag to the admissions committee if one of my references is from someone who knew me 6 years ago? Doesn't that make the description of my character dated and therefore potentially inaccurate, no matter how glowing it may be?\n* I've read on here that people reach out to old professors and give them an updated CV of what they've been up to, which helps the professor write about them. My question is... how does that help, and how is the professor supposed to write about things they're not involved with? Doesn't that make the letter not credible? I've written references for students who've given me a CV, and I only care to cite things I've directly observed, since I can't vouch for their volunteering in X place or their practicum at Y location or Z accomplishment.\n\nMy alternative reference would be a teaching supervisor who I've worked with directly maybe only once or twice a semester, for the past 2 years. I'm not sure how much they'll be able to write about me, but I plan to give them a CV. Their coworker, who I've worked with more over the last 4 years, is one of my 3 references. (They teach the same course)\n\nMy last reference will be coming from my work supervisor (also 4+ years).",

Seeking advice!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I just moved half-way across the country to both begin grad programs at the same university.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm having the time of my life so far-- love the city we are in, the local area, the university.  My first rotations could not have been better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner had a very rough first semester.  She had a very demanding TAship that didn't really allow her to \\*teach\\* (was moreso grading, lab prep, busywork), which is one of her career goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe just returned from her parents' house in our home state yesterday, and she just broke down. She already doesn't like her advisor (direct admit to the lab, the same prof that she TA'd for and didn't like).  She doesn't like the city (noting cost of living, dreary weather, bad bus system).  She has already said, \"if it weren't for you \\[me\\], I would have moved home already.\"  She said something like, \"even if the next years turn out to be the best case scenario, I don't think I will ever look back and say 'it was worth it' when I am missing out on so much family and friend time back home.\"  Her parents are a tad older (late 50s-60s), with aging grandparents, and siblings growing their families.  She is worried that if something were to happen, we are a minimum 14 hrs from home (driving or flying).  Only seeing parents and grandparents in little snapshots when they are aging quicker than ever before is so difficult.  And that she is rapidly losing motivation for research when the idea that she \"could be closer to home in a different program that offers the same experiences\" would eliminate any stress about being far away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both went to undergrad and her masters in our home state within 1-4 hrs of home, so this is definitely a new, unforeseen experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think her reflecting on her first semester experiences makes her vision of the next 4-5 years seem very very bleak.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can I support her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have several ideas for lifestyle changes that would benefit us both, but I don't want to be too dismissive//overbearing by suggesting them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE.g., counseling (I think she also has undiagnosed anxiety), more exercise (currently none), better diet, devise more exciting weekends (usually just lounge at our apartment), try to make closer friends, adopt a cat, stick it out through the summer months....I could go on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do or suggest?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you much",

I graduate spring 2025. \n\nI’m wondering what my chances are, if any at all… I’m feeling really down about this. I transferred to university from a CC and only in the last 2 semesters decided I wanted to go the psychology route, so that is why I have no research/volunteer experience/etc. \nThe highest my GPA can get is 3.7, and that’s with getting straight As. \n\nI’m considering first doing a masters in psychology to get more research, and then applying to PhD programs. The issue is that I have limited places to apply because I cannot move out of state (step kids) and I also cannot really move that far from where I currently am in my state. I live in Florida and many of the universities are good, but so far I’ve only got 3 schools on my list to apply to… \n\nWhat are my chances of getting accepted, even to a masters program, if I cannot venture far out of my current location? Is it bad to do a masters or PhD at my undergraduate university (if I were to be accepted)? Thanks in advance",

A businesswoman/nurse said to cut down some of the details and just list titles for things that are not directly related to research. A fellow undergraduate said to not cut down so many details, but only include relevant positions, and exclude irrelevant titles. My CV as it stands right now is 4 pages, but it can be compressed to 3 if I remove irrelevant experiences and 2 if I remove details from each heading. I've heard that CV size doesn't matter for grad applications but the businesswoman I mentioned said that people will lose interest after 2 pages. All three are quite different, which train of thought should I follow? \n\nthanks",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI had an idea for an app that could be really helpful for university students. The app would allow students to get to know their classmates before they even set foot on campus.\n\n  \nI believe this can have numerous benefits:\n\n1. Since many students come from all around the world, it would be helpful to find someone from a similar background as theirs to form first friends.\n2. It will make it easier to find roommates, accommodation and shared things (tables, beds, basic furniture). This will reduce a lot of anxiety as a lot of uncertainty for international students lies here.\n3. Can make taxi-sharing and car-pools possible.\n4. Students could reach out to each other and start building connections before they even start classes.\n\nI think this app could be a great way to build community and reduce the stress of the logistics of travelling to a new country and starting your university studies. What do you think? Let me know your thoughts!",

The last time I took a course from her, I asked for advice on how to best prepare for the class, and she gave me limited (two sentences) advice. During OH, she often would just insist I work on problems on the board without offering any assistance. When I told her I was stuck, she just said \"I need you to work it out\". We then would just sit there as I fumbled around until I felt bad for bogarting OH. Luckily many of the students struggled with the homework problems too, but after a while I started just observing b/c I didn't want to be up there all the time just struggling on my own. Then I stopped going altogether b/c she was the same way with some of the others...though not all of them. Sometimes she would help others. I don't think I've actually learned anything from her. When I told her I was getting a tutor, she said I \"shouldn't rely on such things\". \n\nFor the upcoming classes, I asked her for the topics b/c I wanted to review them while on break. Her response was that I should wait for the syllabus (last time we got our syllabus on the first day of class). \n\nSeeking advice on how to best strategize for this problem. Thoughts?",

Two of my former professors asked me to work as a TA for them so I did this last semester and will work for haha in this spring.  For one of the professors, I taught a couple of classes when he was unavailable to teach, did all admin work, and graded all the assignments.  For the other professor, we’ll call him “J”,  whose subject matter I’m much less comfortable with (despite getting As in his courses) I mostly helped with administrative tasks and also prepared a 5-10 minute reflective talk related to each day’s topic that I gave the beginning of class.  Last semester, during J’s class, I was frequently on my phone or computer because I didn’t feel I needed to  actively engage in class, would have needed to prepare for hours to be capable of intelligently engaging, and didn’t think that was expected of me.  J is teaching a short January course and asked me to help with it again.  I missed the first two classes because I was sick but I was planning on being there for tomorrow’s course.  Today, he reached out to me to let me know that the students are very engaged and that there aren’t many students so if I do want to be present in class, I’ll need to actively participate and be prepared to talk and contribute.  He did say that if I don’t have time to prepare for that, it’s not a problem and I can just plan to work with him again in the spring.  I’m wondering, is it common to expect TAs to actively participate in class all the time? Part of my thinking was that I was preparing a 5-10 minute talk related to course content for every class and this felt like a doable way for me to engage to some extent while not overwhelming myself (I work multiple part-time jobs and will be back to school in 2 weeks).",

Also started TAing right away which was my first time ever as one. Luckily, things got better with time. I ended up joining a research group which is full of real nice people and the PI is great as well. The research focus of the group is truly exciting to me. However, the research methods and the system in general are totally different from anything I did earlier. I worked in a few different labs before -- they were all wet chemistry based and very different from the field that I am in right now (which is mostly physics). We keep talking about projects to start with, however, I can't seem to properly start on anything. I am struggling to understand or follow while we are having paper or research presentations during group meetings. How do you properly build the background you need? I feel like this is important as it will be the foundation of the Ph.D. I genuinely am very excited to learn about the research but I find myself feeling lost, confused and overwhelmed. How do you actually start working on your own project? I see people from different subfields already in the lab for hours everyday and it makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong or being insufficient.  \n\nThanks so much for your advice!",

I have no publications on account of never having done undergrad research because ~~I'm an idiot~~  I was involved in more ECs than anything.  I feel like those make up such a huge chunk of CVs that any pertinent info I'm adding has already been stated on my resume barring some awards or extra clubs/leadership positions.  Is this going to look weird to adcoms or am I just not going about this the right way?",
