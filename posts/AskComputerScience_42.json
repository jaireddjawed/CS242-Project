I figured since I needed the GPA insurance and I have always wanted to get into programming of any type, why not take it? It's only a three week class anyway (online Winterm).\n\nLast week we learned HTML, and I found it quite easy. Now we're working with PHP and his PowerPoints aren't  nearly as helpful as they were with HTML. Anyway, to the assignment.\n\nWe were supposed to use an earlier assignment that consisted of a form that submitted your address and switch the action to a new PHP file. We were then supposed to get the information using the $_GET array and print it off. Here's where I'm stuck. I already don't understand PHP, so that doesn't help, plus, I've never been great at programming in general, which makes it even worse. I've tried finding information on the class page and I can't find anything, I've tried looking up information and I can't find anything.\n\nHere's the kicker...\nIt's due tonight at 11:59.\n\nANY help is GREATLY appreciated, thank you!",

I'm thinking about taking these additional math courses:\n\n* Analysis 2a (additional integration theory, differential equations)\n* Numerical Analysis\n* Abstract Algebra 1 (rings and modules)\n(Algebra 2 would be about groups, fields, galois theory etc.)\n* Analysis 2b (multivariate calculus, extreme values, manifolds etc.)\n* Introductory Probability Theory\n\n\nOn the other hand, I would be interested in courses like Signal/Image Processing, additional embedded systems course (mostly theory though), additional theory courses (formal languages, petri nets, software verification), artificial intelligence.\n\n\nSo do you think I should focus more on the math (which courses are more important?) or more on the CS stuff I mentioned?",

I found this paragraph which attempted to explain:\n\n&gt;Space constructible functions are useful in the following way: If a Turing Machine is supposed to be running in O(f(n))\u0001 space, where f(n) is space constructible, it can scan its input to determine its length n, and can compute the amount of space f(n) it has available to do its computation. If f(n) were\nnot space-constructible, just checking the length of the input and finding out\nhow much space is left would already make the machine exceed its space\nlimit – functions like that are hardly useful.\n\nMy complaint with this is that I don't see why the Turing Machine has to calculate how much space it has left anyway.  If a TM uses O(f(n)) space, then that's what it uses.  How does calculating the value of f(n) affect how many spaces of memory it uses?  We calculate f(n) when we analyse the TM, but the TM never has reason to calculate it.\n\nWhere am I going wrong?",

Originally this suited me fine as it's quite important to me that I get a decent job soon and there's always some work for web developers (in my country at least).\n\nHowever what I actually want to do with my programming skills is to create my own programs (I'll be moving into other sectors of science, i.e chemistry) and use them to aid in my research. Also just because I enjoy creating my own programs.\n\nNow I assume that you can go from web development to software development fairly easily, but I was wondering if it's possible with cyber security too? I really don't have much of a passion for designing websites and I know I would much rather be working in cyber security to begin with.\n\nDo let me know if this isn't the right subreddit for my questions.",

        "text": "This is my quest:  I want to learn \"in depth\" about how computers work.  I want to learn them so well that I could build one from scratch if I needed to.  Even out of mechanical-only parts:  Like a \"Babbage Engine\" for example.  Of course, I want to be able to build a modern computer from manufactured parts too: that is practical.  The point is that I want to learn computer science via a different route than the way that it is traditionally taught in schools, where they mostly give a VAGUE overview of the computer, and then focus on coding, before they move on to how computers are constructed or invented.  At the start of my \"quest\" I read Danny Hill's book \"The Pattern On The Stone\".  The book started with \"logic gates\" and gave a CONCRETE description of how one could make a simple machine out of tinker-toys using nothing but \"AND\", \"OR\", and \"NOT\" logic-gates.  At first, I was in love with the book, but unfortunately it abruptly jumped from there to vaguely talk about finite-state machines and then programmable computers.  I want something more in depth.  Please, could someone give me some advice?  Are there some really great textbooks and/or DIY kits that could send me in the right direction?  I expect that I will have to learn machine-code and operating-systems too in order to complete my quest.  But the point is that I want to learn things in a certain order that doesn't require me to \"assume\" things that I don't know.  I don't mind if the textbooks are full of math.  I would prefer that to it being \"watered-down\".  (I've already studied Linear Algebra, and I also intend to study Discrete Mathematics too.)  Perhaps a good place to start would be something written by people like Alan Turing or Charles Babbage?  Or is that too ambitious?",

I don't want my ability to solve this problem come from someone else, because I don't think I will learn anything from it. Do I follow some form of protocol? Should I follow a course on 'heuristics-solving' online (which I kinda am in uni)? \n\nThe way I go by now, is playing the Rush Hour game myself, trying to note down some of the things I do, try to write them as 'black boxes', and try to find out what would happen if I pretend I follow these black boxes as my guidelines, and crash/fail.\n\nDo I always include specific algorithms?\n\nThanks!",

Say we analyzed human-created paintings to find color averages in images that are found in most masterpieces of a certain time period. Then, we set our processing power on only generating the areas found in the aforementioned averages before continuing on with the rest of the image's generation. If the averages don't match, we abandon the generation and move on to the next combination. This is still a gigantic problem, but it got me thinking about the problem a lot more and about how it could be broken down more and more. \n\nMy question is are there people out there that study data sets like the one I mentioned above or mining that goes on to try to find things in data sets that have never been generated before? \n\nThanks for any answers",

        "text": "Hey all,\nI'm a 2nd year BSc Computer Science undergrad (UK). 3rd year is the year in which we do our dissertation. My interests at the moment lie in theoretical computer science and graph theory. Over the summer I plan to work my way through some textbooks on discrete math, computational complexity, and proofs so that I can hopefully do my 3rd year dissertation on one of these topics.\n\nThe reason for me wanting to get started on background reading way early is that many dissertation projects in my department tend to be software projects, and so I feel like doing a dissertation on something like graph theory would require a lot more background reading so that I can produce something \"novel-enough\".\n\n**My question is**, do you think it might be a good idea to perform my own lit. review on a particular topic (let's say, graph colouring) after learning a bunch about it so that I have something concrete to show a supervisor when the time comes, which shows that I know X, Y, and Z when saying that I want to do a dissertation on X, Y, or Z.\nMany thanks for reading!",

I graduated several years ago with my degree in Film Production and it has not been the greatest experience. I don't blame the degree itself, more like my lack of foresight. I have bound myself to my S.O. (happily) and she has an established career at a location where I can't really hope to make much money. I've actually been unemployed for a few months now. I am very lucky to be in a position where my S.O. is able and okay with supporting me while I figure things out. I am also looking into a few other career options unrelated to this.\n\nI have always enjoyed sort of simple level coding. In high school I took Java I and Java II and loved those classes. I actually won an award for my 2 player Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots game, which may be child's play to you guys, but I was just a sophomore then. It was also more than a decade ago. Since then I have maintained an interest in HTML, writing addons for World of Warcraft, and also a strange hobby in seeing how far I can push Excel formulas.\n\nBefore I sink more money into my education, I was simply wondering if this (in your opinion) is a solid career move. Is the job market pretty solid just about everywhere? Or will I likely have to move somewhere else to do well in this field? Is the career actually nothing like what I think it is?\n\nWhile I, like so many others, do like having money, it is not all that important to me. I would rather stay with my S.O. and make enough to contribute to our lives together over moving somewhere else to make the \"big bucks.\"\n\nAny input you guys might have would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR How easy is it to find employment anywhere with CS and would you recommend it to someone who's experience so far is tinkering with minor coding?\n\nEDIT: In my research I'm finding that some schools offer both a B.S. and a B.A. in Computer Science.

The choices are as follows:\n\n    Architecture &amp; Hardware Systems\n    Artificial Intelligence / Robotics\n    Big Data\n    Bioinformatics &amp; Computational Biology\n    Computational Science\n    Databases\n    Geographical Information Systems\n    Graphics &amp; Visualization\n    Human Computer Interaction\n    Networks\n    Security\n    Software &amp; Data Systems Development\n    Software Engineering &amp; Programming Languages\n    Systems\n    Theory\n\nI'm a sophomore currently and I just finished my first semester of CS as I switched from aerospace. I took discrete mathematics and an into programming course in Python and enjoyed both greatly. I had a ton of fun doing homework and labs in Python. I'm not really sure what I'd like to do for a career yet because I don't know enough about the field as a whole yet. If anyone could give me some insight on these sub tracks and maybe provide info on which ones lead to certain careers and so forth. Thanks!",

However I'm concerned that this may be unnecessary for what I want to do. To be to the point, I want to work for some renewable energy type of company or a \"green\" company. So....how do i accomplish this? What companies are looking for people like me? Is there a platform where companies like this are actively looking developers and such?  Is grad school a better path to take? Is grad school necessary for me to do \"this\"? any help, suggestion is appreciated and useful; anything from schools, companies, locations, websites, languages to learn, really anything i should learn :P.  \n\nsome background information:\ngoing to be graduating from a smaller private college\nunder a 3.0 gpa (2.9) \nparticipated in athletics (if that matters) \nive had one internship \nsome languages - c++, java, php(html, css, javascript), MySQL plus encounters with others. \n\nCHEER! and thanks!",

Sorry if this question has been asked before.\n\nI'm a sophomore getting a bachelor's in CS, and I hope to go into system administration or network security. But so far I've only taken algorithm/programming classes, and discrete logic. I know I'll be taking more advanced classes in my next 5 semesters but I feel like that's not much time for me to learn what the heck I'll need to know for a career.\n\nAm I worrying too much for being so early on in my studies or should I be looking into external resources to make sure I'm ready after I graduate? I read posts in /r/sysadmin and /r/compsci and have no clue what half of the acronyms or phrases are, and I don't even know how I could do \"projects\" in system administration like I can with programming besides running my basic home server.\n\nWith programming a career path seems so straightforward, like learning how to write efficient algorithms and just getting a good collection of programs up on Github for interviews, but as far as I'm aware there aren't any classes that \"teach\" you how to become a system administrator.",

I've been looking for an easy to understand (meaning that I don't need MSc in math) and to implement algorithm, that is also faster than n! From what I've found there is one that has [quasipolynomial time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03547v1), but frankly it seems to be too hard for me to understand(at least with the amount of time I have). It seems that algorithm implemented in nauty seems to fit my needs but the only document I have found that explains how it works is [this one](http://www.math.unl.edu/~aradcliffe1/Papers/Canonical.pdf) and in it it said that \"We will only consider simple, undirected graphs\" and the graphs that I want to check can have loops.\nSo I would like to ask you if you know some fast algorithm ( I would also appreciate link to some document explaining implementation ) for GI that can check nonsimple graphs with loops?",
