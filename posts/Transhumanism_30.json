        "text": "Many of you feel that we live in a free country. If you do believe the later, ask yourself why you have to buy food every 2 weeks. The very idea of exchange in order to obtain is, itself, not a free system, so therefore buying groceries isn’t free. Most people using logic would then retort with the fact that you’re paying the stores to carry the food and the farmers to produce, eventually farmers pay tax that goes to the government. Where does the money go from there? Not particularly the most logical investments are made in congress, and I will illustrate. \n\t“ In fiscal year 2015, the federal budget is $3.8 trillion. These trillions of dollars make up about 21 percent of the U.S. economy (as measured by Gross Domestic Product, or GDP). It's also about $12,000 for every woman, man and child in the United States.”  I argue that you never realized that if you multiplied the yearly federal budget by 5 (5 years) then you have more money than the debt of the U.S. So my question is; how the hell are we still in debt? \n          Now that we have a visual for the budget let’s look at the spending power of the $1,330,000,000 we still have after mandatory spending. “The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has just delivered the bad news that the national debt is now rising faster than GDP and heading toward ratios that we usually associate with Italy or Spain. That confirms my view that the fiscal deficit is the most serious long-term economic problem facing US policymakers,” states, Professor Martin Feldstein. Don’t get too scared, there is always a solution for those who choose to look at the truth. Right now, 54% of the discretionary spending goes to the military. National security is a huge issue; however, the military’s budget has increase since 9/11. This has given the military 15 years to make itself strong. There are few countries that could go against the military power of the U.S., and even fewer willing to do so. Unless someone is privy to information about national security problems that the rest of us do not know about, then I feel it is safe to decrease the military budget by 46%. This will leave the military’s budget to still relatively large 29% of the discretionary spending. So then the logical question would be, “where would the other 25% of discretionary spending go?” \n\tLet us examine how far we have come in the last 100 years alone. Take a minute to really think about what we have today and what they did not have then. Now use those constructs and realize how they have made your life ten times easier in the long run. These are the technological advancements of the 20th century lead by ambition of people and war of country. Now without “war of country”, what are we left with? Ambition of the people is the remainder. This ambition of the people is the secret ingredient to push the 25% of discretionary spending into scientific enlightenment. This will allow a boom in scientific discovery that has been long awaited since we pushed to the Moon. Again, remember that a good portion of technologies today are the offspring of technological discovery in these historical ambitions. \n\tWe will touch back on that in a minute or two but we should address the fact that GDP is no longer rising faster than the national debt. This means that there will be a stopping point in debt gold mine, but doesn’t mean the end. There could be lift out of the gold mine but if there is not, let us hope that Utopia lies below. By this I mean, there could be a significant increase in GDP from new technologies that arise from technological advancement. The first country to invent a physical infrastructure based on a quantum computational subsystem will be vastly admired by other nations (and the people of those nations). Countries will line up at the door to buy their biggest cities the computational infrastructure of the 21st Century. This is only one example of many new technologies that could arise in the coming years if people focus on the truth. The rise of quantum computation will allow molecular simulations in labs that will show tomorrow’s engineer how to build the next nano-material or quantum computational unit. These technologies will only foster new ones into existence and will slowly start to demolish all the other problems on the discretionary spending spectrum. \n\tThe next approach to be taken may seem a little controversial but I feel is a completely necessary and logical idea. There is a term that is beginning to spread to people, even if sarcastically observed, is the true lift out of the gold mine; or rather the Utopia underneath. This is the construct of Transhumanism. What this position states is that humans are imperfect and we create problems on many spectrums of civilization. These problems could be health, familial, communal, environmental, financial, and in extreme cases, governmental. I feel that our civilization has helped fix and mend most of these problems in the past; but through the power of government. It is time that we mend this “government” problem by changing the root. Humanity can be argued as the root of all civilization’s problems. From the heat of exponential technological advancement people could use the powers of quantum computing to create bigger fields in biological engineering, nano-material invention, and stem cell rejuvenation. The venn diagram of these schools would all join in to create Transhumanism in reality. The mental and physical superiority of a Transhumanistic society would prevail against any other, thus eliminating the problems we have today.\n\nhttps://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/\nhttps://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stopping-america-debt-explosion-by-martin-feldstein-2016-02?barrier=true\n",

David sent one of his agents to infiltrate Absalom's camp, and the agent created rumors which led to bad decisions which in turn led to Absalom's destruction.\n\n However , now we have genetic engineering, we will probably be able to create perfect humans who never make mistakes, never make the wrong decisions, never care about the weaklings, etc.\n\nI think that human would probably be called 'god', just as the ancients called Zeus, Thor or Vishnu as god.\n\nOf course they knew there could be more than one god - there were a bunch of them. Just like there will be more than one perfect humans, who will create some kind of order for themselves and play with ordinary human lives with no impunity.\n\nWe appear to be just around corner from creating gods who do not feel any conscience, empathy or even the feeling that these things exist, in addition to unbelievable intelligence, perfect health and enhanced strength (i.e. being able to break someone's neck with one grab).\n\n",

Who's to say that I am actually still alive in that machine? Would it not just be a (perfect) copy of me?\n\nSure, to everyone else \"I\" will still be alive and act as I really would. But the actual self would be dead. My actual consciousness and self-awareness is gone forever and I'm just dead like so many before, while a perfect copy of myself lives on, believing to be me (since it would retain memories etc).\n\nI guess I have trouble imagining \"switching places\" between my body and machine.\n\nWould appreciate some thoughts and answers here. Please no empty rethoric like \"Isn't a perfect copy of yourself living on in the machine effectively the same as you living on?\" (That's an argument I've seen on Reddit in the past.) No, it's not the same, because I will still die, and the whole point of uploading your consciousness is to NOT die.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "I know it's a fictional species from a fictional tv show but it has me thinking about what would happen if we acheived immortality. In the show the Q is an immortal race of advanced beings with technology beyond comprehension. But the Q society had stagnated. They have (or at least so they claimed) explored everything, done everything, discussed everything. They as a result became stagnant and did nothing. Individuals didn't even talk to anybody anymore. They literally did nothing. It was so much that one of them decided to try to commit suicide, because there was nothing left for him and he reasoned that suicide would be a new experience. A few of them even tried making problems and cause chaos for their own species and for humanity just to shake things up.\n\nAs immortality is something that transhumanist wish to pursue, what does this sub think would happen to humanity over time if we became immortal? Would we eventually after a period of time end up like the Q and wish to commit suicide in the end anyway out of sheer boredom and pointlessness? ",
