        "text": "Among some redditors, there seems to be an idea that the best subreddit moderation is a laissez-faire one, and that moderators should generally not interfere with submissions in a heavy-handed way. In my opinion, this often leads to poor-quality subreddits with repeat posts, immature in-jokes, and a general \"lol idgaf\" vibe.\n\nAs an example of what I'm saying, compare the high quality /r/AskWomen subreddit to the poor quality of the /r/AskMen subreddit. \n\n**AskWomen is an enjoyable and intelligent place to ask questions because:**\n\n* Moderators actively remove any comments that derail threads. Although this sometimes leads to them going overboard, the results are well-thought out top level comments with well-thought out replies.\n\n* To prevent the subreddit from becoming inundated with endless questions about sex, a \"Mate-Free Mondays\" rule prohibits sex-related questions one day of the week. This significantly increases both the diversity and quality of the questions asked.\n\n**AskMen is an frustrating and immature place where asking questions is unpleasant because:**\n\n* Nearly all questions are related to dating or sex to the exclusion of virtually every other topic of discussion. The moderators refuse to actively arrest this with a \"Mate-Free Mondays\" equivalent, resulting in a shitty barrage of endless variations on the same 4-5 questions without end.\n\n* Comment threads are often derailed by low quality memes and shitposting, and nothing is done to prevent this. Discussion of the available questions suffers heavily as a result.\n\n-----\n\nNow, this doesn't mean that every subreddit benefits from not letting the upvotes dictate things, as some places are more freeform and work best without any restrictions on posts or comments. But the clear contrast between the two subreddits is a testament to the power of strict rules to create a vibrant place for discussion.",

This sub is for discussion not argument\n\n2. Be respectful.\nAny kind of abuse will not be tolerated and the post will be removed.\n\n3. Free speech is permitted but derogatory terms towards race, gender and sexuality are not.\n\n4. You are free to speak your mind on any subject if you state your point clearly \n\n5. You are not permitted to submit links or refer to any-one else's opinion on any issue which includes empirical, theistic, political or historical theory or narrative unless you have direct experience you wish to use to illustrate your point.\n\n6. The principle here is agnosticism.\nWhat you don't have first hand knowledge of is irrelevant to this sub and will be removed.\n\n7. For Theists; you can talk about belief only as it directly affects your own life and if you have personal experience relating to a deity or how belief and faith have effects on your life you are free to share. \nThe word God or the name of your God is not permitted, neither is your religion.\n\n8. If discussing philosophical points you may not use the names of the systems of thought but rather explain it as if it were an original concept and how you would use it to analyse and explain your point.\n\n9. 'I am' statements are not allowed.\nDescribe what you  in relation to your point.\n\n10. Explain in dialectical (using logical deduction) discourse your point.\n\n11. Absurdist or blatantly fallacy points will be removed by the moderator if the community consistently down-voters your point.\n\nFor responders:\n\n1. Use the Socratic method for your response.\nDo not enter a discussion with a counter-view point. \nIn discussing an OP's post, ask them to clarify points and challenge them to defend their position until they can either logically defend every objectionable point or if they cannot you may claim their assertion is unsound and end your discourse with them.\n\n2. If they keep reiterating the same point or change the point rather than concede the point is illogical then you can politely reject their post and end the discourse.\n\nOther points.\nAn OP is entitled to present an argument that is counter to their own as another means of understanding the antithetical point the actually oppose.\nIdeally they should ask responders to do the same so in effect each OP is presenting the antithesis of their own thesis although this is not mandatory.",

Full disclosure: I subbed to posture, at least at the beginning, which is why I can get other people doing it. Convincing yourself that you're the \"type\" of \"intellectual\" that browses high-impact, long-form articles and makes witty, educated comments is what I think drives the disparity in this case. There's probably some other reason I'm not thinking of, but I do think the idea of subbing as posture does play into the skewed ratio of interaction here. ",

I will simply say that there seemed to be a turning point where, very quickly, the internet started becoming less and less \"soulless\" and less and less a place where the only overarching principle was refutation of all that was normal and mainstream. \n\nNow, for some reason, we have to make the Internet less \"problematic\" and less \"toxic.\" Which is really fucking retarded. There was a distinct band of internet (4chan/SomethingAwful) that thrived on the novel and crazy. I don't think something like ChrisChan would have started in this era of the internet. \n\nI also feel like there's no way these people actually grew up and totally left the internet. I just feel they're somewhere different or have dug themselves deeper underground to really let themselves fly with their opinion with no fear of backlash. \n\nMaybe I sound completely crazy, but hopefully you guys understand what I'm talking about. Where did this go to?! Is it gone forever?\n\nedit: the source of policing \"problematic\" stuff is usually twitter and instagram and facebook. Not saying reddit does that much.",

        "text": "I like when sites I use modernize, i really do. I don't want them to just stay the same for ever. But there is something about a site you use a lot. You use it for a variety of reasons. A site like reddit will fit into your total media use in a certain way. It will fill certain needs better than other sites - that's why you chose this site over the others. But you also adjust your media use to the sites you choose. So when a site change it may impact your whole media use, it may change the balance between the various parameters that push you towards certain sites for certain purposes.\n\nFor me reddit is part entertainment, part light hearted but relevant news about what is happeneing right now. It's a place for me to make a quick sarcastic comment and get some flack in return. So I want it to be easy to use, I'm not here for \"Reddit\" I'm here for easy anonymous chatter and keeping reasonably informed.\n\nReddit does in some sense look dated but then not really, maybe just a bit nerdy or dull idk. The new design however looks nice, much brighter, sharper. BUT two things:\n\n1.  it's *noisy*! There are lots of things going on that don't really seem relevant to *my use case* (quick news, light hearted sarcasm). It seriously detracts from my primary reason to come here. It also hijacks my keyboard, I'm forced to reach for my mouse which is enough for to me to quickly lose interest (this is not a statement, it's an observation that if a site hijacks my keyboard it becomes annoyingly inconvenient and I'm far less likely to go there)\n\n2. The design for all its \"newness\" it's actually pretty \"last year\", \"facebook clone-ish\". Why would an organization like reddit want to move to an old design developed for an etirely different platform? I think a redesign effort should involve a real hard look at what the core strength of reddit is and build on that. Rather than to try to be something other than reddit. \n\nWhile I don't know this it looks suspiciously as if those who are driving the redesign are not really core users of reddit but rather \"the next facebook\" spreadsheet investors who want to monetize reddit the way spreadsheet investors always do things.\n\nThe way I see it is that soon-ish the old design will disappear, readdit wilt be some next-gen digg/myspace/tumbler/facebook/whatever. And that's ok with me. I don't know if I'll hang around or not.\n\nSome weeks ago I realized I might still have an account digg though I haven't used it for like 8 years. Some old digg-bookmars were still in my browser (not working any more though). That's how it goes. This was just some thoughts set off by my experience with the new design.",

        "text": "Recently I saw this video get shared https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o589CAu73UM in a reddit post. It's about the alleged voice of Neanderthals. The problem with the video is simple. we don't know what the Neanderthals sounded like.\n\nThe data that led to the video in question comes from an unpublished paper written in the early 2000s by a team of graduate students at Duke University. In short, the French government paid some of the grad students a large sum of money to travel to Europe and study Neanderthal voices. One of the grad students was paid to travel to France twice and Germany once. The idea was that they would collect osteological landmark data on the Neanderthal face, oral cavity, and vertebrae and then compare it to Homo sapiens landmarks that had been identified in living humans using CT scans. Specifically, the team was looking at the La Ferrassie Neanderthals. A 3d reconstruction would then be made and the vocal tract would be compared to living homo sapiens.\n\nThe project ran into problems almost immediately when one of the grad students noticed that the interpretation of the CT scans from living humans had not controlled for whether or not the human's heads had been angled to the left or to the right. This meant that any Neanderthals compared to the humans would have a severely distorted vocal tract reconstruction.\n\nThe grad student pointed this out but the PI on the paper ignored him, possibly because he wanted to keep going to France. The paper was sent for peer review where it was promptly torn apart from Harvard's Dan Lieberman. Dan is one of the foremost experts on the evolution of the human head and is something of an emperor figure in paleoanthropology.\n\nI know this story because I'm a current biological anthropology grad student studying the evolutionary significance of hominin pelvic development. One of the professors I work with was the aforementioned concerned grad student. Anybody with a passing interest in the field, even a junior level undergrad, would know that we have no idea what Neanderthals sounded like. But redditors have no experience in this field, and consequently, the \"raspy-high pitched\" Neanderthal trope constantly gets upvoted on this website.\n\nIn my mind this is a symptom of a larger trend of redditors only understanding the absolute minimum about a subject. Yet the karma system rewards people for posting information that other people agree with, not information that is actually accurate. This is especially true when it comes to things that redditors know for a fact will earn them karma, like the Steve Buscemi meme or bad jokes like This can be seen (in my mind) on every /r/science post about a study with a small sample size where the top comment (or close to it) will invariably be \"correlation is not causation.\" Sure, that's technically true, but it's one of the first things that you learn in a stats class and it's much more nuanced than that for any number of reasons.\n\nMy personal favorite example of this is trigger discipline. Trigger discipline is one of the very first things one learns about firearms. It's so easy to spot that redditors use it as a signal for \"I am knowledgeable about firearms,\" despite the fact that trigger discipline was not widely taught or practiced until the 1960s. Reddit is never above critiquing actual combat veterans or John Browning himself about their trigger discipline, despite the fact that these groups know far more about the weapons they are holding than any random redditor.",

However, I would argue that the term \"*their* content\" means that this rule only applies to content edited and deleted by the original creator, and that moderator actions are not held under this rule.\n\nAnother rule of note is the section on the Reddit API, which seems to say that it should not be used for the purpose of breaking the earlier cited rule. However, this would seem to imply that the very idea of websites such as ceddit.com, which is intended to show comments deleted by moderators *but not* those deleted by the creators of those comments, is one which violates the rules. Is this accurate? ",
