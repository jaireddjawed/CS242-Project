I completed an internship during my last semester at university working in DotNet. I am currently working with Mendix which is a low-code software platform that uses Java and JavaScript. \n\nI work at a company where they focus on personal growth. They give you the time and resources to develop yourself. I am thinking I want my future career to be a Lead Engineer. Someone who oversees the development team, and is also responsible for assuring the product is meeting it’s goals (time/defect ratio/velocity of completed work). \n\nWhat would be some tips or better to say the correct steps to take to ensure my success at becoming a Lead Engineer? I know I am asking for a cookie cutter answer with something that can’t be baked. But knowledge is power and I want to see what you all might think. What are some principles that I should be sure to follow? Any books, articles, or other resources that helped you along your journey? Is it just experience and exposure to the applications? Should I make sure I understand computer architecture? \n\nI know that there are many great engineers that have came before me, so help me not reinvent the wheel. \n\nTLDR: What are some tips to becoming a lead engineer?",

To me that's just a different way of saying \"rush developers to squeeze the most out of a product with the little time that they have so that the company can make as much profit as soon as possible.\"\n\nArticles about developer burnout and wasteful meetings only affirm my beliefs. I get that the world operates on working products, businesses want to optimize and eliminate problems, that's always been the case. But I want to work for a company where I have the time and space to be creative, to think about different approaches, backtrack and redesign. I want breathing space, I want the time needed to craft a product with thought and care.\n\nThe client isn't always right. Sometimes the client needs to be patient. Good things take time.

        "text": "I'm almost entirely self taught, I don't have much formal experience, but got through most of a degree before dropping out because it wasn't interesting. most of it was online, it also wasn't doing great things for my mental health and felt like a waste of time and money.  I passed when I was healthy, and spent most of my time just working on personal projects instead of uni related things, especially since the work took very little time and felt like I was just jumping through hoops. I've won a few CTFs and am mostly interested in cyber security and networking.  \n\nI've been working  a new job as a \"network engineer\" for about half a year, it's my first real job.  Since I've started, I've been given full responsibility of the network at this company of around 50 people.  I am writing ansible scripts for the vyos routers I deployed, and have to maintain the pfsense routers that are configured in the most.... interesting.... ways and still need to exist for existing things that have yet to be migrated.  I'm maintaining most of the servers in the rack and have been the one deploying them, securing them, networking them, and documenting it.  Existing servers are Xen based, with some esxi servers, and I'm deploying servers using libvirt on gentoo.  I've also made a passbolt server for the team that is used heavily, prior, we just used one password for everything.  I'm also currently having to write custom software to wrap the entire process our department mostly relies on, because the software we have to use is super shaky and things have been falling through the cracks a lot, something that has been a growing issue since before I joined.  On top of this, I have to be on call for 40 hours out of the week, something that I will apparently not have to do any more if the department grows, but for the time being, is a requirement.\n\nI feel like this is a lot of work/responsibility and my total pay is below 60k, and I live in a major city in the US.  I feel I'm providing a ton of value, but not really being paid well, and I it was a real pain even getting a job because I didn't have a degree, or other work experience despite being more than qualified.  I'm the only one at the company that seems capable of doing this networking/sysadmin work, and on top of that, these are all tasks I've taken for myself. Nobody is telling me do do this stuff, I just see what is currently in place needs improvement, and I've been very successful in integrating new things.  Within a month of working there, I was able to set up a new VPN, and supporting things which allowed the entire team to work from home, something that we leverage heavily now.  I just don't see a raise coming and I feel the market isn't great right now, and I can't list very much \"experience\", but have so many technical skills, especially when it comes to Linux.  I also do a fair amount of FOSS development time and have pushed code to the selinux project and a few other things, I just don't know where to go from here, because I feel incredibly undervalued.",

I am honestly unsure what career path I should be going to, I would love to develop my technical skills even more and explore the tech industry or explore the management consulting world. \nI know that tech sales has it’s assets and can be a lucrative and rewarding career which is what I want ultimately in my career and I would love to even start a business at some point in my life.

Feedback was that Im senior in some areas but in most of them Im a \"really strong mid level\" so they cant offer senior rate for me. Right now Im thinking of how to respond to that.\n\nWhat is this? Seniors are expected to know everything 100 percent? Every senior I worked with usually specializes in 2-3 areas and looks up others as he goes. I guess shes trying to lowball me or something.\n\nTo be honest this is hilarious for me. If I wanted I could land a contracting gig with same 30usd/hour in my city 5 miles away from my home (Im based in Latvia, capital city Riga). But this is US based company so what the heck? Am I being gaslighted? Or is this rate the new normal?\n\nMaybe Im being delusional here, should I manage my expectations or something?\n\nCan you share your experiences with negotiating hourly rates as a senior dev and what rates you guys charge for EU/US B2B contracts?",

I know that in the beginning it's gonna be hard but maybe it is doable. I don't want a full time job because I would hate it and also because it's hard to find a company that would let me work from anywhere in the world due to tax/timezones etc. (can you confirm?).\n\nIt's also been a year since I am having no-sleep nights where I try to think on a possible solution and after some months I found out that that part time freelancing idea could be a good fit for me but I am still not sure about that and I'm not even sure if I would really like to design and develop websites but I don't have other many alternatives besides digital marketing or maybe UX Design.\n\nI just would love to know your honest opinion about this and what would you do if you were me, considering everything that I've just written.

Sometimes I do modelling, more often I don’t, because my team has matured products. Sometimes I write Spark applications that push recommendations or predictions to my users too. \n\nThe Modelling component of my projects are always run offline.

MLE in big tech requires quite advanced software engineering skills, I honestly don’t have the qualifications to be one.\n\nMy end goal is to join a big tech as a data scientist (or sometime similar).

It will be my second, I am coming from a nursing/healthcare background and have been a nurse for around 1.5 years. \n\n\nCurrently, I find myself mostly interested in data analysis or web development and was wondering if I can get some advice.\n\n\n1) I’ve noticed that analyst positions seem to be versatile in the field (there’s business, operations, data, healthcare, etc), would it be easier for me to switch to healthcare analytics because I already have a healthcare background? \n\n\n2) Which career has better prospects for progression? \n\n\n3) Do any of these career paths face challenges within the next few years? Will they still be relevant?\n\n\nAlso I don’t LOVE math and I’m not very good at it past calculus. I did pretty good with statistics though in college. Would there be more math past that in analytics? \n\n\nThanks!",

I'm happy with my coworkers and the company culture but they never give raises and the pay looks worse every year due to inflation. So I'm looking into trying to find a new job that would pay more.\n\nI made a couple of shitty little beginner web apps when I was first applying for jobs because I had no experience, but none of them are an accurate reflection of my current experience and most of them are broken anyway since I haven't maintained them for 4 years. Nothing I've worked on at my company can be directly shown to anyone since it's all proprietary code; the best I can do is vaguely describe the apps and specific things I've done to improve them.\n\nI could make a handful of new portfolio projects of course, but to make something that's actually impressive for my current skill level would take a lot of time and energy that I could be spending applying to jobs. So I'm wondering: if I have 4 years of experience already, how much does a portfolio really matter? Would spending months on a bunch of high-quality portfolio projects before applying anywhere really be better than just spending those months applying to jobs? I don't want to waste my time if it's not going to make a huge difference.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

I know that it is often recommended to get into various companies, and in certain areas like Data Science and AI, I see many people saying that it is even mandatory to get a job.\n\nMy problem is the following, does it matter much what university the person graduated from? I speak because I currently take CS at the University of the People, an online non-profit university that the U.S. government recognizes, currently I do this more for having in the curriculum an American university and everything else with the goal of applying for jobs outside of Brazil. The point is that as I do not earn in dollars, this is weighing for me the amount I pay that is little for those who live in a country with a strong currency, but for those who do not live, it is costly.\n\nI was then thinking of doing a university here in Brazil, which ended up being cheaper. The problem I see is this being an issue after applying for jobs in other countries, especially for areas like AI that I mentioned above, which I would like to follow; what about this?",

Now i'm beginning to find it increasingly difficult to keep the conversation lengthy and worthwhile enough in successive meetings that i'm starting to wind up these weekly meetings within minutes.\n\nAll in all, I guess I feel a bit guilty that I dont know how to effectively use their time and whether I even know what I should be using this time of ours for. I could propose reducing the frequency of these meetings but I dont think it would stop me from just saying \"Hey, everything's A-OK. See ya next month?\".\n\nCan anyone shed some perspective or opinions on this? Would be super helpful. TIA",

Currently, GPT4 is out and it can take in \\~8192 tokens (much bigger input size) allowing it to take in documentation or advanced and really elaborate queries to make it write much better code than ChatGPT used to a few days ago. This means that if your specification is elaborate enough, it can actually write decent code.

Maybe if I had something to grasp, I'm thinking I could have formulated my end of the conversation better? Wrt regression testing, smoke testing, functional testing, etc.\n\nI'm just wondering, does this stuff happen to assess candidates from ground zero in SV or maybe they just forgot?",

        "text": "Hello everyone. \n\nI just graduated from UMD in the winter with a BS in computer science, and I’m pretty worried about getting my first job…\n\nFor starters, I am an older graduate, turning thirty next week actually, and so throughout college I had to work full time. I worked in retail and restaurants to support myself. Consequently, I didn’t ever get an internship, and work sometimes interfered with my studies. My gpa was only around 2.3 after a long and complicated college career spanning from age 18-29. I also never really had time to develop personal projects, so all I have to put on my resume is my degree and class projects. I still put my work experience down for now, but am planning on taking it out…\n\nAs of now, since I’m out of school and have free time, I just apply everywhere I can, and decided to start some projects. My best class was web development with JavaScript, so I decided to learn reactjs, and I want to develop a MERN stack app to put on my resume. Right now I’m doing some react tutorials to get a feel for the framework and refresh from the class, since I took it a while ago… but I think the career path I want to go down is full stack development. I enjoy all aspects of it, designing ui/ux, coding server side logic, setting up and populating databases, I want the whole package. But obviously I’d take the first job I can land. \n\nSo far I’ve had to turn a couple of interviews down because they required security clearances which I don’t want to deal with. I started applying in the beginning of February and have had 4 phone interviews so far. I haven’t had a technical interview yet, but I’m kind of terrified of them tbh. I do get emails from company’s like Synergystic, but it seems kind of scammy and maybe more of a last ditch effort kind of deal.\n\nSo I guess my questions boils down to this: is my plan… good? Am I going about this the wrong way? I look at the requirements for entry level jobs and I feel so unprepared from university. And I also know the job market is less than ideal at the moment (to put it lightly). I’m trying to not be too disheartened, as I’ve read about people on here who took 6-18 months to get a job post university, but it still feels like I was thrown into the deep end after just learning to swim.\n\nTLDR: 30 yo fresh college grad with 0 industry experience, trying to land first job, looking to see if my plan is bad or not.",

        "text": "Making this post seems a bit out of place given the recent layoffs, but I’d still appreciate any thoughts on my current “career trajectory “.\n\nI’m working at my dream company currently. It’s not quite The Big Five, but a very well established company in the gaming industry.\n\nI’m not sure how I actually landed this position or what anyone on the hiring team saw in me. But after unsuccessfully applying to development jobs for 3 years (as a career change), I got an offer for an entry-level position in QE/SDET @ 70k/year. Within four months, I got my first raise and jumped up to $80k/year.\n\nAlthough this isn’t the position I was originally looking for, it’s hard to deny how good things have been. I’m working on an incredibly interesting project with a world renowned client, and I find the job to be almost stress-free. The work itself is arguably a bit unsatisfying, as I came from academia and the computational research I did there was far more challenging. But I made less than minimum wage doing research, so it’s hard to argue with the financial stability this role is bringing.\n\nI’m wondering if it’s worth even trying to migrate over to development or if I should continue on this path? There seems to be a lot of upward potential and it’ll easily be a six figure job at this rate.\n\nA consideration at this point is I don’t envy the development team on my current project. There are only senior developers and although they’ve been kind enough to include me in their architecture and dev meetings, I hardly understand what they’re talking about. So it’d probably next to impossible to get a job as a developer at this company. Especially with the current landscape and further decline in junior and mid-level roles. \n\nIt would certainly be cool to make the stuff the dev team is making. They can seemingly create new custom tooling in a matter of hours. It’s surreal trying to keep up with it on a testing/automation front, none the less trying to understand the intricacies of the code base to help write new unit tests or documentation. \n\nThankfully it doesn’t necessarily bother me to not know things. I’m happy to learn as I go and internalize any feedback and knowledge as it comes up throughout each sprint. I do try to pitch in with the main codebase when I notice something and so far all my tickets and pull requests have been approved. But realistically, the work I’m submitting is probably trivial to the overall scope.",

        "text": "As a recent graduate, I successfully secured a entry-level position at a defense contractor because of my school's career fair. I had no prior internships or jobs that would fit this role either. Also I graduated with a 2.5 GPA. I worked on my resume and elevator pitch, then I made sure to follow up the next day via email. This secured me an interview. For some reason I don't see this suggested that much, if at all. This was the best advice I ever got (from my mom).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Just a heads up, career fairs offer more than just opportunities with defense contractors. At the one I attended, I also encountered construction companies, police departments, and other diverse employers. Interestingly, even construction companies reached out to me about IT positions, but I was specifically aiming for a defense contractor. While online applications are easy, they pit you against countless candidates globally. However, at career fairs, you only need to make a positive impression in person and then follow up via email. In fact, if I hadn't followed up with an email, I wouldn't have landed this job. I hope this advice proves useful, and I wish everyone the best :)",

I’ve completed 1 internship in Business Intelligence so far and want to get 1 to 2 more internship experiences before I graduate next year. The work I did in Business Intelligence was tedious and was low level coding mostly, but I am appreciative of the experience nonetheless. \nI’ve been applying to all kinds of positions from Data Science, Software Dev, Consulting roles and even some finance roles. I am honestly unsure what career path I should be going to, I would love to develop my technical skills even more and explore the tech industry or explore the management consulting world. \nI know that tech sales has it’s assets and can be a lucrative and rewarding career which is what I want ultimately in my career and I would love to even start a business at some point in my life. However, I am hesitant to pursue tech sales at the expense of developing my technical skills.\nThe offer is for a inside tech sales  position at Dell and would be paying 26 CAD/h (19$ USD/h) and it would be a remote position in Canada. Compensation is not my main concern, I am focused on the best learning and growth opportunity for me. \nWould appreciate any advice or help.",
