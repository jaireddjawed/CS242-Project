        "text": "Most cities run certain low ridership bus routes to provide coverage to people without cars, despite scoring poorly in terms of rides provided per $$. To avoid spending too much money on these routes, they only run during \"traditional\" working and commute hours. Other routes with moderate ridership may have a few additional hours of service, but they don't run overnight either. \n\nThis doesn't serve people who need transit outside those hours. For example retail employees whose store closes at 10 pm, or restaurant workers leaving even later. \n\nCan anyone provide insight into some average costs per rider  on low-to-moderate ridership routes? How do those costs compare to Uber/Lyft/TNCs, both the \"retail\" fare for such rides, and guesses to the full cost if the company is using VC funding in some cities to subsidize them? \n\nWhat are some percentages of transit agency budgets that get spent on those higher cost per rider coverage routes? What should that percentage be? How should agencies be balancing that percentage against simply providing the maximum number of rides possible at the lowest cost per rider, even if that means cutting relatively expensive routes?",

I would love any kind of advice or insight you might have about my situation, which might be a bit specific, since I haven't found much luck online.\n\nI graduated from a university in the US with a BS in Psychology but since have moved abroad where I teach English, so no planning experience/education other than self-education (reading books and watching YouTube vids). I've decided that it's time to pursue what I've always wanted and now want to go back to school.\n\nThese are my big questions:\n\n1. What type of degree would I need to get into the industry? Would an undergraduate suffice or will I have to pursue a Master's too? (I'm assuming my background couldn't get me into a Master's program in Planning straight away)\n\n2. As I am living in Japan, I would prefer to pursue an online degree taught in English. Can anyone recommend a good program they might have experience with?\n\n3. Perhaps the biggest question, what is the job market like for someone who wants to become an urban planner outside of the country that they studied in? In other words, if for example I complete a program with an American university, would employers in Europe or Asia consider me a qualified candidate for a position? Is it generally best to get a degree in the country you intend to work in?\n\nThanks in advance, any and all comments/questions/warnings welcome!",

        "title": "Personal rapid transit (autonomous podcars) – why not?",
        "author": "bighkes",

        "text": "&gt;Personal rapid transit (PRT), also referred to as podcars, is a public   transport mode featuring small automated vehicles operating on a   network of specially built guideways.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;— wikipedia\n\nEveryone knows cars don’t fit the city, environmentally, safety-wise  and space-wise. Fortunately, not everyone needs/ can afford/ can legally  park one. The cost of building infrastructure for cars, a type of  individual transport, is prohibitive (Elon Musk – we need to go 3D)  nowadays and in most countries even in a foreseeable future. Public transport is understandably not good enough for most people living in  the suburbs and beyond.\n\nHow I think PRT could solve it?\n\nPrague is a city with 1,3 million inhabitants, 2,6M in the larger  urban zone. It has (besides to 65 km of underground metro train) around  550 km of tram tracks. I think tram tracks are a great “model” for a backbone network of PRT. If you rearrange them a little, I think you  achieve that every place in the city is within 1000-1500 meters from it.\n\nI imagine the network to consist of two parts – the enclosed backbone  network (“tram tracks”) and the last mile network, which is basically  every street fitted with curbs/guidelines/guide wires under the asphalt,  really just any cheap and simple guideway.\n\nThe last mile network would cost virtually nothing and pods would  drive there between 3 and 6 m/s and always stop before pedestrians  (unlike cars do) so they would completely safe for everyone including  children. With this we achieve that a pod is even closer to you than  your parked car without you having to find the parking spot!\n\nPods should be the narrowest and lowest they can, so that the  enclosure/digging of the backbone network is the cheapest. The pods will  be for one or two persons anyway (car occupancy is that low), so 0,8 m  of inner width is more than enough. 0,8 m is also the width of the  standardised palettes, so cargo can be transported too. Also there is no  reason for the height of the pod to be more than 1,5 m (I think 1,2 is  OK). That should fit people with special needs and getting on/off could  made easier by elevating the guideway in that place. Indeed, the pod is  nothing else than a moving lounger.\n\n[This is hyperloop, but I like the height. There is no need to be able to stand up a create giant pods. Think Japanese.](https://i.redd.it/rru1cvoamtf11.png)\n\nFor keeping the costs low the backbone network would be on surface in  the streets (no expensive tunnels or sky ways and their supporting  structures, should be cheaper to maintain, too, cheaper emergency exits  etc.) I think that’s more than a fair solution because that’s what cars  do in (not some but) every street. 2 meter width (1 for each direction)  1,5 meter height, basically a (only one :) line of parked cars that can  be architectonically adapted (gabions, plants and more) unlike a line of  cars. Crossings would be multi-level (one or both ways below the  ground), digging a hole for this should be very cheap given that you can  see large dug metro stations, utilities digging,…\n\nThe transportation capacity of the backbone network should be enough. 20 m/s speed, one or two persons every 20 meters. That’s a full tram  every 1,5-3 minutes, which looks right given that this should be at  least three times faster. It is easy to add another lines in each  direction, if that’s not enough. Or reduce the 1 second intervals to a more or less continuous line of pods (also lower air resistance), but some slots should be free/freed for entering from the last mile network.\n\n(subway train in Prague has capacity of 1500 and smallest intervals they say they can achieve (i don't know if that applies to autonomous subway implementation) are 115 seconds, already employed at peak hours – that's 13 persons/second.)\n\nWith pods with two persons every 4 meters (which already sounds too much sci-fi and in tunnels very scary) you achieve 10 persons/second/lane but at twice the average subway speed. With four lanes, which could fit subway tunnels (5 m diameters) it makes 40 persons/s.\n\nThe pods should be reasonably cheap as they would consist of an  electric motor, a small battery for the last mile network (power lines  in the backbone), one or two seats, air condition and self driving HW.  SW is always cheap and looks doable, it is much simpler than autonomous cars.\n\nHow navigating in the last mile network differs from self-driving cars? It has fixed ways and drives at slow speeds, so emergency stopping in a meter, comfortable in a few meters is possible . Simply it can slow down and stop before any obstacle. Expensive omnidirectional sensors of hundreds meter range like LIDARs are not needed.\n\nDifference from the conventional PRT is it uses already built roads, because huge conventional cars are not needed.\n\nIt could be controlled remotely, so the rescue system can make its way with nearby pods automatically vacating the last-mile junctions. Also they would be reasonably light, so rescuers might quickly move them by hand, if not by remote control.\n\nLet’s say the pod would cost 3x less than a car, so per 50k pods its $250 million.\n\nThe question is how much would the backbone network cost. Given that  you can use existing asphalt surfaces and it is possible without a rail (  is it? for speeds &lt;20 m/s), the costs would be mainly in the outer shell (from concrete prefabs?). If the backbone network was $5 million per km, it’s $2 billion for 500 km of the network. BTW $2 billion cost a 5,5 km tunnel Blanka opened three years ago.\n\n($5 million per km is a 2+2 lane motorway cost in the Czech Republic)\n\nAll cars would be parked in the countryside at outskirt parking lots,  and pods would drive you directly to your car in less than 15 minutes  (that’s their current application at airports). Your cars could be  relocated on classic rail if you requested because you wanted the car to  be parked on the opposite side of the town you want to exit from. Maybe  it won’t be parking lots, but electric VTOL airports.\n\nAutonomous deliveries to customers would be possible, garbage  collection simplified etc. No noise, no brake dust, no pollution, no  Russian oil, tripled space in the streets. Running costs lower than for  the current public transport arsenal, all electric, no traffic signs,  lights, much less roads to be maintained, backbone network shielded from  weather. People pay for cars more than those 2-3 billions.\n\nWhere’s the catch?",

In contrast, European cities were constructed with urban cores being the locations rich people chose to live, making Euorpean cities see. Glamorous and glitzy in comparison. So I wonder, if the European cities have significantly greater density but still have homes concentrated in the city centers, where do they build the houses and how do they exist alongside apartments and offices but dont waste space like we see American ones do?",
