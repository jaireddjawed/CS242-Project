Well, that guy happens to be my team leader. (TL) \n\n\nEssentially, I work at a very small office taking calls and also doing offline work. Each time we go offline, we are to document the times. Not sure why, but it's mandatory. Two weeks ago, I was called into a meeting with him and this is the following conversation:\n\nTL: You're not tracking your offline work.\n\n\nMe: How so? I track every time I'm offline. \n\n\nTL: Every now and then you're not tracking your times. Look. *shows me a graph*\n\n\nThe graph essentially showed that there were a lot of times I went offline for not even 30 seconds to help someone out, take a breather, etc.\n\n\nMe: Oh, I apologize.\n\n\nTL: I need you to start tracking *everything*. Even if it's a few seconds.\n\n\nMe: So you want *everything* tracked?\n\n\nTL: Yes.\n\n\nMe: Can do. \n\n\nI return to my desk. Now, I started doing exactly what he wanted me to do. I included things like:\n\n&gt;Not feeling well, went to the bathroom from *Time* to *Time*. Had diarrhea. Don't go in the bathroom.\n\n\n&gt;Went offline from *time* to *time* to answer a question that *employee* should've known the answer to.\n\n\n&gt;Went offline to take a sip of coffee from *time* to *time*.\n\n\n&gt;Went offline from *time* to *time*. Had to urinate. Drank too much coffee.\n\n\n&gt;Went offline from *time* to *time* to say hi to another employee.\n\n\nThis went on until last Monday. He called me over for another meeting.\n\n\nTL: I did not expect you to be childish about tracking everything.\n\n\nMe: How am I being childish? You told me to track **everything**. I don't want insubordination on my file.\n\n\nTL: Allow me to rephrase it. Track times you go offline to do actual work. No details are needed. I'm getting questioned by *Boss* as to why this is happening and why they're so descriptive.\n\n\nWe both chuckled and I returned to my desk. I have not heard anything from him about it since. ",

        "text": "Here is a short and sweet story:\n\nMy mom owns a few rental properties in a high traffic area and as a result these properties get a lot of usage and a variety of tenants. One time a fridge in one of these said properties started acting wonky. Mom decided that it would be wisest to get rid of the old fridge and get a new one. She headed to [insert home improvement store] and got a new fridge and made an appointment to get it delivered. The delivery men would haul the old fridge away free of charge.\n\nThe day of the fridge delivery arrived and the haulers came with the new fridge. They first hauled the new fridge upstairs into the apartment which is a few flights of stairs. Overall the haulers had a great attitude and didn't seem to make much fuss... that is until they saw the old fridge they were supposed to haul away.\n\nApparently there is a rule for the hauling company to not remove or haul away any appliance that is hooked up to any of the walls. Unfortunately the old fridge had a water line that went to the back wall to supply water for the icemaker. The water line was already shut off so my mom told them it didn't matter. Here is what unfolded:\n\nMom: That water hose isn't connected to running water. The icemaker has been shut off for years now.\n\nHauler: Sorry ma'am but we cannot break policy here. If we remove the line and then something happens, we and our company will be liable for damage and we cannot risk that.\n\nMom: So you are saying that you cannot remove the fridge because you might be liable for any damages from removing the water hose?\n\nHauler: Yes. Exactly.\n\nMom: So if there wasn't any hose attached you could get rid of this old fridge?\n\nHauler: Yes we would.\n\nMom: Turn around for a second.\n\nHaulers: *all turn around and face the opposite direction*\n\nMom: *sounds of a scissor cutting a water hose*\n\nMom: Ok you can turn around again. Oh what do you know the fridge isn't connected anymore. You can haul it now correct?\n\nHauler: Yes. (*talking to other haulers*) Boys lets get this out of here and wrap it up.\n\n\n\n\nAnd thats how my mom made her own loophole to get her fridge hauled.",

        "text": "I work at a high-end function room so we do weddings, meals, etc. We occasionally do a tribute night, where there is a big 4-course meal of really good food (the event chef has a Michelin star to his name) and a band doing music after which are usually pretty good. Everyone comes away happy, customers like it cause it's a good night out, management like it cause it makes a lot of money \n\nAnyway. One night its a big tribute night (175 people so we are full). I'm usually on the bar but because its so busy I get roped in to help serving food. It goes off relatively smoothly until we get to one woman (let's call her B for bitch).\nB wasn't happy previously in the night, as she kept clicking at me to get my attention when it was clearly busy on the bar as well as making the same drink for her 3 times without charging because she \"didn't like it\". It was too busy for me to care so didn't think of it.\nAnywho, halfway through food service (when all of the staff are really busy and stressed), she starts clicking me over and she complains that the food she had was \"completely unedible\" (despite the fact she had eaten nearly all of it ). I replace it and about 2 minutes later she pulls the manager up, again complaining. This is the second course she has done this BTW as her starter was \"bland and had no taste whatsoever\"\n\nWe give her a bottle of really good champagne and tell her drinks are free to comp for it (Which is rare as the owner loathes a bad review on an event night.)\nDesserts finally come as B is holding everyone up by not letting the managers get on with their jobs. Everyone else loves the food expect B.  She storms up to me with a half eaten dessert demanding to see the chef and wanting a full refund for the night. I try to calm her down but B starts to shout and people are getting pissed off.\nThe chef comes out and B sprays him criticising every aspect that was wrong . Afterwards, she storms over saying she wants full refunds for her and her table. We explain we cant do that as it was her company who booked and only if the table was dissatisfied can we give out a full refund. \n\nWe eventually come to a compromise of a free bar for her table on anything but spirits and high-end stuff. But yet again B still has to go at it, every time she comes up she buys the whole table a round of drinks (Jagers, bottles of prosecco, you name it) and making us redo it every time to the smallest thing wasn't right. At the end of the night, she came up to the bar with the biggest grin and said \"well if the food was as  good as you said none this wouldn't have happened\"\nHowever. Unknown to her, every time she made us redo the entire round we added them unto her tab as wastage as she refused it with it being quite expensive alcohol, the final bar tab came to around 2 grand.\n\nWhen the company rang up the next day to ask why this was so high, we explained it to them and they didn't sound too happy she was wasting 2 grand of company funds on proving a point. \nLast event night we had the other week, B's company attended but no B. Hmm strange that.\n\n",

I normally try to get in quickly when I realise that they want the electrician (because hardly anyone actually listens to \"Hello, pharmacy\"). \n\nSo, one day Mrs Fusebox phoned up. I greeted her with the above hello, pharmacy ... and she immediately started talking about her lights.

HOW RUDE!\" So I stood there for 5 minutes listening to her problems with her electricity and her fuseboxes and all sorts (I never said I listened well) without uttering a sound. When she finally said \"So, what can you do?\" I simply said \"As I tried to say a while ago, we're a pharmacy so all I can do is say goodbye\" then hung up.\n\nI didn't even offer her the phone number of the electricians.",

Back then dial up or ISDN connections were still widely used, but people were starting to quickly shift to DSL - which the operators didn't anticipate, so they often didn't have enough ports available in the local DSLAM.\n\nAfter some missed deadlines for getting the connection up, and 3 days without internet in the new place they decided they'll need a technician come out and have a look at it. First he checked all the in-house cabling, and corrected a fault he found there. \n\nThen he went to the patch panel in the basement, removed a wire, patched my wire in place, patched the removed wire somewhere else, and told me to check upstairs if the modem is syncing. I checked, and it was online.\n\nI went back to ask him about moving the wires, which seemed a bit fishy. He then explained:\n\n\"We're out of ports at the DSLAM. You're getting a new connection, which means we don't have fixed dates when we need to provide it. Currently it'd probably take 2-3 months. Now I've removed your neighbours connection, and patched you in their place. So now it's a fault, which we need to fix within 24 hours. I've logged a fault ticket already with patch panel information, probably by the evening they'll have the DSLAM extended from maintenance storage, and your neighbours will be back online without a technician having to come in here again.\"\n\nI've later talked to my neighbours which were not home at the time of this happening - they never even noticed a service break.",

Once we were selected, we went to the place again to sign the paperwork. This particular apartment was on the second floor above a row of garages, so our stairs (made of wood) were on the outside of the building. We noticed that the top stair had a huge obvious crack going right down the middle lengthwise. Both pieces of wood were still hanging on and you could still put pressure on it, but we still didn't necessarily want to be moving all our crap up the stairs and wonder whether it was going to break. We brought this up with our manager, and he said with a heavy sigh that since it was on the outside of our apartment, it was the HOA's responsibility and that it was hard to convince them to spend any money. Then he looked us square in the eyes and said the only way they'd replace it is if it were completely broken. We took the hint. As we were preparing to move in my hubby stamped on the step extremely hard and broke it completely, immediately calling our manager to report it. The HOA replaced it within two days.",

It snowed a lot this year, the last time it snowed this much was close to 20 years ago, so there's a lot of work going around.\n\nAnyway, earlier this week we were clearing up a network of rooftops at a large spa/resort. One of these buildings was an ice arena. There is over a meter (3 feet) of snow on this particular roof and it is heavy. It's a large building, and even with a crew of 10 people, it would take several days to clear up. On the beginning of second day, the GM of the spa decided it is too expensive to hire a crew anymore and decided to let us go that day. My boss explained to him that it's not wise to let us go as the weather is warming up and snow tends to get extremely heavy if it rains, but the GM didn't want to hear it. We packed up our equipment and left that day. \n\nA few days later (Thursday) the weather warmed up and the snow started to melt rapidly. On Friday, it started raining and my boss got a panicked call from the GM because the roof of the ice arena partially collapsed under the weight of the snow, and needed a crew to continue to lighten the load. \n\nSorry bud, can't go on a building thats unstable, you're going to have to rebuild the roof.",

College rescinded my scholarship and is charging me a $5,800 fee for the month and a half of the semester that I attended (note: this fee is separate from what I’m paying for FAFSA). I tried to contact the Dean with my issue and got an email saying he doesn’t have time for me. If I don’t start paying immediately, they’ll send it to collections at a 33.3% interest and my credit will tank. \n\nOkay then. Wanna be a bunch of petty bastards? Two can play at that game. I contacted my bank and talked to a lawyer. You should have stipulated a minimum payment in that fine print. Enjoy cashing my check $5 at a time for the next 97 years. I know I’ll be laughing every time I see that money leave my account. \n\nEDIT: a lot of people are suggesting I go to the news. I would far rather avoid making a public spectacle of myself, as honestly, I’m pretty sensitive. If I had a legal standing, I would pursue that in a more private manner, but the thought of being a 21-year-old college dropout sensitive girl up against this hugely well-funded private school that supplies half the doctors and lawyers in my area is a bit too much for me. Thank you, though, to all those encouraging me regarding that route! I’m going to pursue other ways to contact the Dean, and get together medical records and recommendations from my doctors showing the drop out is what was best for my health. Thanks for all the advice!",

We were super high traffic in summer and often were scheduled on the floor alone during peaks. Dirt job.\n\nOur shop had a fancy hi-tech bluetooth wifi thermostat AC that originally we all could use, but according to one of our managers, “we used it too much,” or “we would leave it on overnight and waste energy.” He eventually revoked our ability to change the AC, reasoning that he would get a notification on his phone if it went over 80f. \n\nMy last week was the end of summer, and the height of a three week long heat wave. The windows were open, but it was still sweltering, and I texted my manager to turn on the AC. “Close the windows and I’ll get it going.”\n\nI do what he says, and he neglects to turn on the AC for another hour. With the sun at its highest and the freezers all blasting out stupidly warm air, the shop becomes an oven. Every other person that came in complained about the heat—even the ice cream in the damn freezers was starting to melt. However, I keep the windows closed, and, with my Mexican blood that is fueled by heat, tough out what the thermostat reads as a solid 108f in the shop.\n\nOne woman, bless her, asks if she could speak to the manager. I pass her his business card, and she tells me that she’s going to give him a stern talk for making us work in these conditions. She straight up calls him in the middle of the shop, berates him, and hangs up. I’ve never been so pleased with someone asking to talk to my manager. \n\nEventually he spams my phone saying the AC is on, it’ll cool down, keep the windows closed though, that’ll help, I think something is broken. I ended up closing the shop early, and later learned that the cooling system had overheated from being overclocked that day. \n\nTLDR; Don’t steal my tips, I’ll break your AC.\n\nEdit: Jeez this blew up! Fixed the formatting. 80f is 26c, 108f is 42.2c. I don’t know jack about air conditioning units, I just had my manager come to me the next day and say “Yeah the AC broke down, you had it working too hard yesterday,” haha.",

        "text": "I had the fortune (and misfortune) to attend a private school from elementary to middle school. Now, I say misfortune because though the school had excellent academics, their priorities were... confusing, to say the least. It was Christian, so the dress code was a bit ridiculous and so were their ideas towards women in roles of leadership. Though I’d love to say I challenged these myself, it was actually my friend challenging them for me.\n\nWhat were the rules, you ask? Well, for the guys the rules were 1. No Mohawks and 2. No cut offs. Everything else was fair game. Girls? Natural makeup only. No bra straps showing. Skirts knee length, shorts finger tip length. No leggings as pants (and that included when your skirt was over them). No shoulders whatsoever. Oh, and no unnatural hair colors. All of these things were ‘distracting’ and ‘displaying ungodliness.’ One time a girl got sent home for wearing a Bob Marley t-shirt. Another girl had to change because her tank top was too thin UNDERNEATH another shirt.\n\nNow, I have a great love for all things colorful. Therefore, I dyed my hair bright pink the summer before seventh grade. I loved it, my parents loved it, we were all happy. The principal? Not a fan. So, he called me to the office on the third day of school. Said, ‘manic, you either keep your hair up in a bun or you cut it off. Otherwise, there will be grave consequences.’ I’m like, okay. I can’t afford a suspension on my record. So, I try my hardest to wear my hair in a bun every damn day.\n\nA problem arises. You see, I have thick and unruly hair. I also played volleyball as a blocker at this time, meaning I was jumping A LOT. My team had a no bobby pin policy because a girl somehow got stabbed by one a few years prior. So, no matter how much hairspray went into the bun, it refused to stay. I resorted to tying it back in a braid and just folding it under itself.\n\nMr. Principal did NOT approve. A week after I started this, I got called to the office. I will spare you the details, but our conversation basically consisted of me saying I was trying to follow the rules, him saying I was being difficult. Then I was instructed to give a reason as to why I wanted colored hair. I said it made me happy and expressed my personality. He said that was ungodly because God should be the only one through which we express ourselves (?????). I countered with asking why only ‘unnatural’ colors were ungodly. Could orange hair be accepted? Could gray, since our hair will all eventually turn that? Apparently exhausted of this conversation, he conceded those colors would be acceptable. Finally, he ended threatening expulsion unless my hair turned natural within the next week.\n\nSo, devestated, I booked a hair appointment and chopped off all of my pink hair (it was about halfway up).\n\nHere’s where the malicious compliance comes in.My friend ‘Jane’ was not ready to concede this battle. She had colored her hair in the past, but strictly a slightly lighter shade then natural. However, she was looking for a change. When she heard that orange and gray were natural, she lit up.\n\nA few weeks after this incident, enough time for everyone to quiet down, Jane comes to school with the most god-awful combination of fluorescent orange and random streaks of blonde in her hair. Neon green would have looked tame compared to this monstrosity. Now, of course, she is called to the office almost immediately. But she came prepared. She is not gonna give up easy.\n\nShe brought the entire handbook to her meeting. When the principal asked what happened to her hair color, She flipped through to the section that said ‘Only NATURAL colors of hair are permitted.’ She brought out a picture of a girl with orange hair. Yes, she literally printed out a random picture from the internet to prove orange hair was, in fact, natural. And, since blonde was HER natural color, that also was allowed.\n\nHe just had to let it go. I figure he knew that her parents would fight him on this anyway. I got such satisfaction from seeing them pass in the hallway for the month it took before she colored her hair back.\n\nEdit: a word",

        "text": "In the late 1990's, my wife and I were living in an apartment complex in Provo, Utah just south of BYU, and they decided to raise the rent 10% because they could.  We only had one year left at school, and the hassle of moving was too much, so we just stayed.  There was no increase in amenities or services, just, a 10% hike on a 40-year-old apartment.  Anyway, after I signed the new contract, I noticed in the fine print that the rent could be paid in cash.  I was delivering pizza at the time, so I would save my tips all month long, cashing down any larger bills I got each day, cashing up any coins to bring home just $1 bills, until I got $550.  I would then go to a fast food store that had paper bags like McDonald's or Hogi Yogi and take all of my carefully-counted 550 $1 bills and just cram them into the bag.  \n\nThe first time I went to pay, the apartment complex manager asked me, \"What's this?  Is this drug money?\"  I said, \"It's my rent, in cash.  I'd like a receipt, please.\"  She made me wait while she counted and bank-faced each and every bill.  I did that from June 1998-May 1999.  Not an amazing malicious compliance, and my wife refused to go with me because she was embarrassed, but I thought a 10% rent raise without any increase in service, or even a fresh coat of paint, was unwarranted, so that was my only recourse besides moving out, and I was too damned lazy to do that.  Drug money.....shit....in Provo, Utah?  Drug money?  I think __she__ was high.  That place is so stone-cold sober they only have math addicts.  ",

Years.\n\nWe explain that to every client. We tell them “We do our part, we fill the forms, assemble the package, mail it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Then we sit tight. The processing time we are seeing for your type of case is X months.”\n\nI’ll be fair: most people get it. They understand we don’t personally print and distribute Green Cards or visas. But you always have the 5 or 6 clients who call weekly for an “update” even though the update is always “we’re still waiting to hear from USCIS.” And then you have people like Mrs. Hunk. \n\nMrs. Hunk is very anxious to bring her Brazillian model hubby to Texas. So Mrs. Hunk calls and emails me DAILY, even though I’ve explained to her that I have absolutely no way of forcing USCIS to process visas any quicker. Today I (politely) told her she cannot call me all the time, and I would call her THE INSTANT I have news about Mr. Hunk’s visa. So she complained about me to my boss.\n\nI’m a lucky bastard and my boss is a good boss. She knows I’m good at what I do, and that I don’t neglect clients or cases. So, far from chewing me out or believing Mrs. Hunk, she cracked an evil grin and told me “maybe we can find a way to give her those daily updates she wants...”\n\nSo before leaving the office for the weekend, I scheduled a daily recurring email to Mrs. Hunk. From now until we actually hear from USCIS (probably September-October) she will receive this email every day at 3:15 PM:\n\n“Dear Ms. Hunk,\n\nWe did not receive any news from USCIS regarding your husband’s case today.\n\nTalk to you tomorrow!\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Me]”\n\n\nOnce I do hear from USCIS, I plan to alter the email slightly.",

We were blessed with a GM who cared about us and made working there a complete joy.\n\nOf course he got promoted to a district position and then we got a new GM. Let's call him Blowhard, because he was a blowhard. He was introduced to us at a 8am on a Sunday store meeting where he told us his life story that he was so proud of. Did you know he used to be a GM of Circuit City? Of all the things to be proud of that's at the top of the list. He went down the list of places that he worked at (All big box retailers, all defunct), and went on for at least over an hour. \n\nHe then proceeded to explain how he was going to run the store, and that's by getting credit card applications. Is someone coming in to buy a soda? Better ask if they want a Best Buy card. He told us he was going to look at how many applications we all got and if we didn't have a certain number by a certain time we'd have a mandatory 6am training meeting every week until we got our numbers up.\n\nNow I was in Geek Squad, which at the time meant repair, working the Geek Squad desk and having to go everywhere in the store because managers assumed that since we're Geek Squad we can totally take over appliances, and since that meant we were out on the floor we were beholden to the credit card application rule. \n\nEventually the deadline came and I was sitting pretty at zero credit card applications. See, my strategy was if a manager was in eyesight I'd give a half assed attempt at offering the card getting a guaranteed no. If no one was around I'd skip it. I was proud of my zero.\n\nSo Blowhard comes up to me, gets in my face about my big fat zero, and puts me out on the floor for the day and tells me he wants three credit card apps or I'd have to be at the meeting.\n\nI work, I don't offer, but surprisingly three customers ask me if they can sign up for a card, so I sign them up. \n\nBy the end of the day I've got my three and Blowhard is so proud. He gathers up everyone in the store when we close and gives them a big speech about how he rallied the troops and it was through his wisdom and techniques (He always talked like he was a motivational speaker. Think Tony Robbins with multiple head injuries) that I pulled through and got the apps because I believed in myself.\n\nHe brought me in front of everyone and full of confidence told me to tell everyone what techniques I used to get them.\n\nI just shrugged and said I didn't do anything. He was pissed and sent everyone off to finish closing and went on about how I embarrassed him in front of everyone.\n\nWe all figured what he was doing violated some sort of company policies so there were never any official write ups or anything and not long after I quit due to more of his bullshittery.

I have anger issues myself so it's easy for me to snap at people but I control myself and I can't understand why others don't do the same.

She finishes on her phone and looks at me \"What happened to you?\" I point at the retreating form of the Goodest boi \"he just licked the life out of me, and it was awesome.\" she gets annoyed and tries to tell me off because she loves fluffy dogs too and I remind her I had to shut up so she could deal with her bullshit. \"next time don't snap at me and I might point out the dogs\" she bows her head in submission and apologises, we kiss and go into the mall and shop and I describe how it panted so loudly I felt it in my head and she fully regrets being that way with me and we agree on trying to correct it.\n\nNeedless to say that the snapping has been reduced tremendously and she asks nicely if I could wait rather than snapping at me to shut up.\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend snaps at me to shut up so she can text and gives me the opportunity to not alert her of the best dog ever seen. She learns to stop snapping.\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I really didn't want to make this edit, but getting a little tired of reading these comments so far so I want this out in the open. I wish I knew the word for \"less than a prank\" because that's what this was. Rather than getting pissed off, getting all petty and arguing with her in public or when we got home, I just got the most amazingly timed opportunity to show her that her behaviour is bad and has repurcussions. She laughed immediately at her mistake and we have been closer ever since. No pettiness. No visciousness. She wasn't hurt. Seriously. If you read my post with this edit and still think negatively of my relationship, then just move on. Please. Because you will be wasting your time with any observations you have on something you have been given a 20 second glimpse into.\n\nI seriously hope readers enjoy reading this silly situation and my relationship does not come into question again...\n\nThanks.",

It stretches across the yard, or did at least.  A windstorm knocked over two sections, and my Dad told me to help him put it back up.  \n\nMe, thinking this was a bad idea, watched part of the fence fall backwards as we lifted it.  Nails and rotten wood on the moist dirt.  We used a plank to prop it up, and it slid through the mud, forcing me to hold it alone.  It freaked and cracked, another piece fell.  \n\nI told my dad \"bad idea, bad idea,\" very clear warnings.  He made me hold it, then went to the second, smaller section of the fence to the left.  In that time another section fell over and I said, \"and there goes another,\" so my dad got pissed.  He said he had enough of my shit and I said \"it's literally falling apart as we put it up,\" to which he ignored and made me hold for a while longer.  \n\nHe went to grab a screwdriver and a plank to hold it together.  Haha, too bad, the fence was caving inwards already and I stood by letting it, because I was instructed to hold the fence.  One by one, like dominoes, the sections of the fence came crumbling down to the ground, while the small set of four planks I had my hands on remained steady as I leaned against them.  \n\nHe came back and I got off scotch free because I did exactly what he said and Mom backed me up when he tried to say I was smart ellick through the.process.  She agreed, bad idea.  ",

        "text": "I’m sorry I’m on mobile so the formatting might be a bit messy\n\nI work part time (6 hours a day) for a small company (maybe 30 employees at most). Most of my job revolves around placing calls to ship lines to get information on various subjects. Usually I can get ahold of most ship lines within 20 minutes. While I talk to the agent I’ll check 2-6 different orders and be on my way in less than 30min. \n\nOver the past few weeks call hold times have really spiked for a few of the more common ship lines. The worst being a new Ship line that has yet to get completely setup. This creates a problem because I can’t do anything to generate revenue until I call the ship lines to confirm certain information. \n\nEveryday I make a lot of calls to these ship lines while working on scheduling appointments, finding carriers (truckers), building loads, and working on projects that deal with organizing operations within the company. \n\nI have a love/hate relationship with my job. I love what I do and who I work for but I hate the slow parts of my day. I keep trying to convey the message of “I can’t do it all” and so far only a few of my coworkers understand that I can’t touch things until I get the facts straight. \n\nA coworker might build/schedule something without verifying the information then pass the stuff to me just to double check everything. Usually this works because most of the time nothing changes and if something ends up changing I can change it. I note every single change and let the account managers know if anything major happens.\n\nI can’t do stuff early like my coworkers. Since I’m the last one to check the information I MUST call first before I start anything so that once I do something we don’t have to worry about any problems that might pop up. This has turned into a headache for me because I can’t simply do the quick and easy stuff right away and end up having to slowly make progress through a mountain of paperwork. \n\n\nToday I had a little conversation with my boss (VP of company). The conversation goes a little like this... VP is “VP” Me as “ME”\n\nME: “I hate these new ship lines they suck for hold times, it’s like I’m on hold all day” \n\nVP: “don’t worry just make the calls”\n\nME: “are you sure? We could just email them to get the *needed information*”\n\nVP: “just sit on hold, what you get done you get done”\n\nME: “how long should I limit myself on hold? I still have to cover *lanes* and finish building this stuff for *customer*” \n\nVP: “sit on hold as long as it takes” \n\nME: “so can I do *tasks* before confirming the information?” \n\nVP: “no we have to verify everything and get the loads already built updated first” \n\nME: “okay boss”\n\nWell.......... so far today I have been on hold for 5 and 1/2 hours total and one call was 2 and 1/2 hours alone. I have done nothing at all for the past week because of the amount of time I’m on hold\n\nTo be transparent with my managers I started noting every call over 20 minutes in a shared doc between my superiors and myself. I am working, I just am accomplishing almost nothing during the time I’m at work. \n\nYou tell me to sit on hold? okay. You want me to piss away time? Okay. \n\nYou can’t get mad at me for doing what you told me in the exact way that you told me. \n\n\n\nProof: \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/nKh30\n\nedit: The picture shows 8:24am, that is the moment i started the call. The call ended at about 10:55am and i was on hold for roughly 2 hours and 25 minutes. the whole call maybe lasted 5 minutes (usually I am talking to someone for no longer then 5-10 minutes).\n\nTLDR: manager said to sit on hold as long as it takes. Okay, I wasted 5 and 1/2 hours today. ",

It doesn't usually happen but there was a long queue at the cafe and I needed to get food because I was scheduled to be on lunch cover that day (which means you can't leave your desk at lunch because you need to answer the phones, and given I was the only one on the team in that day I basically wasn't going to get a chance to eat...). \n\nSo one of the managers (not even my own manager!) sends me an email bollocking me for being back late and telling me 'not to let it happen again' whilst copying in all the other managers into the message. \n\nSo seeing as they've decided to take hours worked so seriously then I guess I'll be sticking to those 37.5pw. \n\nOh was it sweet leaving at 5:30 on the dot today for the first time in months. \n\n-\n\n*EDIT: yeah I'm obviously not planning on hanging around at this place much longer.

In the Air Force Dc is basically the student leader in charge of the flight of 50ish when the instructor is not around, or any other situation where the instructor says so.\n\nNow anyone that has been to a basic training, there are several tiers of tension in a barracks. There is the direct instructor who obviously lords over the trainee's on a daily basis. Then there is a lead instructor, usually much more intimidating and you see them once a day maybe. They usually look like they eat children for breakfast. The next level up, is administration, or the people that yell at you because you exist. You will never do anything right and you are conditioned to fear them at all times.\n\nBeing \"in charge\" I would get the low level complaints from the rest of the trainees. From not enough clean clothes, to the recurring problem of bank issues. Some members weren't receiving their money correctly, or some other direct deposit issue, and had not been able to purchase their own supplies, razors, soap, etc since arriving so other people were paying for them. I brought this up several times to our instructor and the response each time was, \"figure the shit out.\"\n\nSo on a midweek day when we were back at the barrack's and had nothing planned, the same 3 trainees brought it up to me again, so I gave them permission to go to the phones out on the patio downstairs and call the bank. The rare times we got phone time it was late at night when said banks would not be open, so having open time during the day, when people are not really allowed at the phones, was the correct solution.\n\nAbout an hour later my instructor yells from his office \"DORM CHIEF!!!\" and my oh shit alarm is blaring. \"Why the F would you think it was okay to send trainees down to the phone's during the day? So-and-so is threatening to recycle you back to week 2 and wants to strip your honor grad ribbon. What, the, F?!\"\n\nMe:\"Well those trainees have had to ask others to buy them supplies at the shop because their banks are having issues. i brought this up several times, and you just told me to \"figure it out.\" So I did.\"\n\nInstructor: \"Well... Yeah... F*ck me... I will talk to them. JUST DONT EVER DO THAT AGAIN!\"\n\nStill was top of my class, never got in an ounce of trouble for that, and people could finally buy their own shit again. Tell you what though, those women who were in charge of our squadron were scary as fuck, glad I didn't have to talk to them.\n\nTL:DR Basic training instructor has to deal with the big baddies because he told me to figure out a problem, and I did.\n",

Tegrat has a policy, at least when I worked there that you had to be at least 18 to work register in case an alcohol sale came into your line (state law says that to handle or sell alcohol you need to be 18).\n\nDuring my training my manager told me that I need to ask for ID for every alcohol sale in case an officer or someone decided to do a shopping check to see if we ask for ID and complied to laws. \n\nMy first week working one of my childhood friend’s dad came through my line buying some beer. Knowing that he was definitely of age I rang him through, when the POS (point of sale) asked me for their birth date I just put in 1/1/1990 because that was enough to clear 21 years old and let him check out. \n\nOnce my manager saw this she came over to me and told me that I need to check ID for EVERY alcohol sale. An hour passed by and this like 80 year old lady comes in my line with a bottle of wine. I ask her if she has ID on her. She laughs and says yeah right. I tell her that it’s policy and law that I check ID for every alcohol sale as to not get fined. She tells me that she never carries her ID on her because she doesn’t even drive. I tell her that I can’t sell her alcohol. Old lady begins to get upset and I hand her off to my manager so management can get an earful.\n\nAfter spending some time with my manager Old lady ends up leaving having payed for her alcohol. Manager comes back to me and asks what that was about and I told her I was just checking ID for every alcohol sale, to which my manager stopped talking and walked away\n\nTL;DR manager told me I had to check ID for every alcohol sale for store policy. Old lady wanted to buy a bottle of wine and didn’t have an ID and I told her I can’t sell it to her. Manager asked me what that was about, told her I’m just doing my job. ",

        "text": "I work in a factory. We produce a basic construction material and my job is basically to make sure the material is to code, and pack it away in a box for shipping. I have several measurements I'm supposed to take (circumference, length, etc) and I'm meant to throw away anything doesn't meet the required measurements. \n\nThe department is basically governed by two sets of competing goals.\n\n1. The quality department. These guys want everything to be perfect and pretty. If a single measurement is even 1mm over, the product fails their check and is supposed to be thrown away. If the product is perfectly to spec but a bit ugly (color variations, etc), it's meant to be thrown away. They'll occasionally grab finished boxes from the warehouse and audit them. Our names are on all of the boxes so if they find anything they disapprove of, They'll fail you and you get in trouble. \n\nKeep in mind that each box contains anywhere from 1 to 22 items, and they stack them in groups of 6 to 18. So if they go through a stack of 18 of my boxes that contain 22 items each (That's nearly 400 pieces), I'll fail if they even find 5 pieces that don't meet their standards. They're strict.\n\n 2. My boss and my bosses boss. They want to ship out as much product as possible. Because their concern is all about how much we produce, they will get us in trouble if we throw out too much. Sometimes they'll wander by our trash cart and pick out items that were thrown away for being a mm or two over, And tell us to box it. We report everything we throw away and those who chuck too much tend to get transferred out of the department.\n\nSo it's all a balancing act of throwing away enough to keep Quality from getting suspicious, but not enough to get your bosses on your ass. \n\nAnyway, one day I was having a bad run. My product looked like crap. The rule is that after 3 bad ones in a row, I'm meant to go to the supervisor. My regular supervisor was on vacation so I had a guy I had never met before. I go to his office and tell him that all my stuff is VERY out of spec and ugly as sin. I asked him to come take a look and tell me what to do to fix it.\n\nHis advice? Put it in the box. \nI emphasize again that it's all terrible and that I'm not comfortable sending this product out, And again ask him to come look.\n\n\"Put it in the box. It's friday.\"\n\nWell okay.\n\nI go back and I start boxing everything. See, this supervisor forgot about a handy policy that my company has. If the boxer  (me ) is told to box something they don't want to box, They're allowed to cross off their own initials and put the initials of the person who instructed them to do it. It's meant to be directed towards other boxers, but I never read a rule that said it couldn't be used towards a supervisor. \n\nSo that's what I did. I boxed it all, crossed out my initials and put my supervisors down instead. I got praised for how much I had produced that day. And the best part? Over my weekend, Quality chose to audit those boxes. The whole order got thrown away and had to be redone. My supervisor got a reprimand for passing such horrible product, And I haven't seen him in my department since.",

So it's fair to say he doesn't have the best idea of what gets sold a lot and what doesn't.\n\nAnyway to the malicious complience, as this is still ongoing there won't be a very satisfactory ending, so apologies in advance.\n\nHead of corporate have decided that every branch needs to reduce the amount of stock they're holding, my store is about $30,000 over their estimated budget and so my manager decided on the best way to reduce our stock on hand. \n\nNow there's a few things that could have been done instead, like him paying for everything he's ordered in and taken but is still showing in the system (over a grand worth) or writing off the stock we're showing but don't have (easily a couple of grands worth) or even reducing the thousands of dollars of stock we hold for one customer that barely spends a couple hundred a month but no, he decided that I shouldn't order ANYTHING in unless it's been asked for specifically.\n\nSo it's been about a month now and I haven't ordered in anything, everything we would sell on a daily basis is either dangerously low or has completely run out, customers are having to wait 1-2 days to get the most basic of things, there's not enough stock to fill the shelves so there's gaping holes, i doubt we're even close the the $30k mark and someone from corporate will be down in a couple weeks for stock take.\n\nMeanwhile, i'm just gonna keep doing what I was told and watch it all fall apart",

        "text": "TL:DR.  Customers don't understand how heavy gravel is and insist I crush their truck, trailers, and other equipment under its weight.\n\nI used to work in a small gravel pit as a loader operator, most of the time it was loading dumptrucks with 10yd^^^3 of gravel.  At least once a week though some hill billy would come in with his old beat up pickup and ask to have me load it up with gravel.  This is a terrible idea.  Pit run gravel weighs about 3000lbs per yd^^^3.  A small pickup bed can fit as much as 2yds of gravel but this will crush the truck under that weight.  I always explain this and invariably I get a response of \"just do it gently and I'll tell you when to stop filling.\"  I'm pretty handy with the loader but there really isn't a way to be gentle with gravel because it doesn't pour like water, as I tilt the buck down nothing will happen until a huge chunk sluffs off all at once.  I can jiggle the bucket a little to knock small amounts loose at a time but it's still a huge amount of weight dropping from 3 or 4 feet above the truck.  As soon as the first pile of gravel drops into the truck the truck driver's eyes go budlgy as they see their tires bulging out and the bed squat down nearly to the ground.  I've never seen these guys come back for a second trip.  Presumably they get wherever they are going and then realize moving 800 lbs of gravel out of the pickup bed by hand sucks a lot lol. That or they break down under the strain.\n\nBut the piece de resistance was the day a garbage truck pulled in.  This was the kind of garbage truck that hauls a large trash box on the back of a flatbed.  Not the little boxes you see behind Wendy's these are big trash bins for commercial sites.  The truck normally drops the boxes off then come back when it's full and winch the box back up on to the truck and haul it off. \n\nI hop down from the loader and ask what I can do for them.\n\n\"We're gonna drop this box down by the gravel there, we want you to put 12 yds of gravel in it.\"\n\nDoing the math real quick, they want 36,000 lbs of gravel...  there is no way in hell that trash truck can winch that much weight back up on the truck.  its a single axle truck, that much weight is normally hauled by a truck with four axles.  \n\n\"Sir, are you SURE you can pick it back up with that much weight?\"\n\nThis is where he crossed my personal line of respect.  He snaps his fingers to cut me off, \"I know what I'm doing, I've filled that box up with concrete before and lifted it no problem.  just do it.\"\n\n\"Well, if your wrong there is nothing I can do to pull the gravel back out...\" \n\n\"I don't have time to waste discussing it with a gravel boy, let's go.\"\n\nIt's no wonder he's so full of shit, what else would a giant ass hole be filled with?  I nearly knocked my self unconscious with the power of my salute and jumped up into the loader.  I loaded him the same way I'd have loaded any other truck, one scoop toward the back of the box, one towards the front, and finish with one in the middle.\n\nThings were looking good, I hopped down with invoice in hand to watch the show.  The guy hadn't even acknowledged me, as soon as I pulled the loader away he was already backing his truck up to the box.  With total confidence he hooks up his truck winch to the trash box full of rock and sand.  Winds the winch tight... then for a moment you could hear the winch struggle, then woooooop the front of his truck sprang up off the ground about 6 feet!  The guy shut it down and lowered his truck back to the ground, the box had not budged an inch.  I was struggling so hard to keep a flat face.\n\nImmediately he came rushing over to me \"You over loaded it! You idiot!  There is no way that is 12 yds.  You need to fix it!\"\n\n\"Sir, the bucket on the loader is 4yds, 3 scoops for a total of 12 yds.  There is no way I over loaded you.  As I said before, there is no way for me to get the gravel back out once it's in there, the box isn't deep enough for me to scoop from.\"\n\n\"Well, what am I supposed to do now?\"\n\n\"I recommend a shovel.\"\n\nAnd that's just what he did.  He left and came back with a couple more guys and shovels, and for three days I got to watch them shovel their mistake by hand while all the truck drivers who came in to buy materials would stop to take pictures.  When they had finally moved enough material out of one end they opened other end up and I lifted the light end with the loader to pour the remaining gravel out.\n\nThey promptly packed up and peeled out.  Never saw them again but I do get a warm feeling every time I see one of those trash trucks now.\n\n",

        "text": "Brief background, I have 5+ years Cardiac Telemetry Monitoring experience; this is the live, in-house reading that happens in most hospitals on Cardiac floors and elsewhere. \n\nThere are alarm settings to notify me if the system detects any 'abnormalities' and I quote this because while it may detect some or most of them it does a piss poor job of notifying our staff of anything abnormal from the patients standard rate and rhythm unless we are privileged to safely adjust these parameters as the default high and low limits for the system are 150 and 50 BPM. (i.e. an athlete may maintain a heart rate in to 40-50s which would send a constant alarm to the Monitor Technician for an expected result, causing alarm fatigue) \n\nWe frequently have dying patients, or patients with as previously stated low or high heart rates that are expected to be that way so receiving notification of these is arbitrary and quite redundant, and also unsafe because this leads to overexertion or missing of *actual* alarms due to overflow.\n\nRecently my facility has been having issues with staff competency and alarms \"not ringing\" according to the staff on shift at the time and this has caused for a lot of corporate and executive participation to help diagnose the problems and assess for solutions to them. (Hint: it's the staff, not the technology) When my shift begins I personally go through every patient history and assess their 72 hour trend graph for heart rates (basically showing what their heart rate has been in line graph form over the last few days) and based on this I would adjust the high/low alarms to allow adequate quiet time while still keeping patient safety at its maximum.\n\nMy boss pulled me aside to go over some new policy changes for issues unrelated to myself and first on the list was one regarding the facility defaults for these alarms and how they are not meant to be adjusted without a doctors order. I informed my boss that this would cause added stress to an already high stress job and that this would counteract the corporate appointed change of our department recently to a quiet and secluded office(closet) area. She informed me that I am to follow the company policy as it is our 'bible' and that I will be updated as any of this changes based on my input. I go back to work a few more hours and proceed to set every alarm back to default only 5 minutes before the end of my shift and provide my relief with a copy of the above policy, my sincerest apologies and I am on my way.\n\nFast forward to three days later where I have been off of work since the previous talk with my boss, having ignored several phone calls from my departments number and texts from co-workers for these days. It turns out they have been meaning to contact me as they cannot figure out how to shut the alarm off and the speakers wired up to our several computers to handle the telemetry have been outputting a constant droning array of non-urgent mild boops, slightly concerning beeps, and what could only be compared to your least favorite alarm clock sound going **WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH!** for the past three days.\n\nTwo staff members were so fed up with this over these three days that one quit, and the other transferred to a separate department, and the executives of the facility and director of my unit are undergoing the lengthy process of getting a nation-wide policy changed due to my simple compliance of clicking one button..\n\n**\"Reset All Alarms To Default\"**\n\nThis was a little lengthy and also my first post here, I appreciate any input or thoughts to how I could sum any parts of this up better or word things differently.\n\nTL;DR: Company policy is/was \"Do not change default alarm settings,\" I complied and set **ALL** alarms to default before my three days off and received phone calls/texts for several days and two co-workers left the department due to the over stimulation. Policy is currently being rewritten.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, on mobile, you get the gist.\n\nThis is the unfortunate tale of my annoyance towards my nDad being taken out on a woman he was emailing about an upcoming event.\n\nSo at midnight, just as I had shut my laptop and was settling down for some sleep, my dad storms into my room and gives me a disappointed look. He's annoyed that I had not come to him after finishing my course work to do his business for him. While I knew he wanted me to do this stuff, I had been working until the close of my laptop and had been expecting him to come earlier and get me to do it. His business, not mine and I don't get paid while his secretary does.\n\nSo I'm understandably annoyed as I have to download 31 individual sheets of paperwork from those bringing machines to the event. Risk Assessments, Insurance, all that fun shit. None of these people know where the on button of a computer is, and most of the paperwork is badly lit, pixelated photos they have taken of the paperwork on their phones. This means that things that could be a .pdf of seven to eight pages is now 8 individual .jpg images, all with different formats of default names.\n\nNormally I would compile these images into a pdf for each different person, and name it using their initials. But hey, I'm not getting paid. Instead I compile the mess of paperwork into a .zip file and send it off.\n\nNext day arrives and my dad informs me that my \"stupid file\" can't be opened by the woman, obviously it's my fault because god forbid he be mean to those not bound to him by blood or marriage. To double check, I download the .zip on another computer and see if I can open it. Spoiler, I can. The same thing happened last year with this woman- the div doesn't know what a .zip file is and tries to view it straight from the email instead of downloading it first.\n\nSince there was so much paperwork that I had no time or fucks to give for, I emailed her and introduced her to the wonders of winRAR and how there were too many files to send in one email without compression. She replied saying \"I would prefer it if you sent the files individually.\"\n\nI hope she enjoyed the 31 emails, each containing one random piece of a random persons paperwork.\n\ntl;dr - Business person doesn't know/care how to work a .zip file, asks for individual paperwork, recieves 31 individual emails with individual paperwork.",

I'll try to clarify the best I can on stuff, but if anyone's confused let me know and I'll be happy to explain further.\n\nSo I work in a natural gas plant, and these things are built to run in very specific ways. It's my job to constantly monitor our temperatures and pressures to make sure our plant does what we want it to do. I work in a team of 5 including my boss.\n\nIt's also important to know that at the end of every day, we have a shift report we send out to our team plus my bosses boss that details everything we did and what we might have changed with the plant so everyone always knows what's going on everyday and why something might be different when they come back from days off (we work 8 days on, and take 6 days off), or as a log to look back on in case something funky starts happening in the plant we have a reference to look back on.\n\nSo on to the good part. One cold morning that my co-worker (C) and I are about to start lining out our work for the day when my boss (B) walks in and starts talking to us. He explains that we need to start being more descriptive on our reports, and that we need to really make sure that every time a set point is changed on something, we explain why and give a good reason. Not 10 minutes after explaining this, he sits down. In front of our computer and immediately changes a set point  without saying anything. We decide to try to figure out why.\n\nC- did you just change that?\n\nB- yes I did!\n\nC- why? You know we're supposed to explain changes   to the system like that.\n\nB- well I like to change around shit and see if you notice! (Said jokingly of course)\n\nOk Mr. Boss man, if that's your reason. At the end of the day when it came to emailing and filing that day's log, we made sure to put \"Boss changed this set point from X to X, because he likes changing shit and seeing if we can find it\", and sent it out to our team email that includes our 2 other operators, our boss, and his boss.\n\nWe had to put down a reason for the change, so we have his reason.\n\nLuckily our team is laid back so after a stern warning over email and a slap on the wrist we all got to laugh about it, and my boss learned to work on giving his reasons.\n\nTldr: boss wanted us to explain more on reports for changes, said \"he likes changing shit to see if we'll catch it\" after a change. made to sure add that to our report.",

        "text": "Twenty something years ago in 1st grade, my teacher had a card system for each student. At the beginning of the day, everyone's card would be green. If you misbehaved, it got changed to yellow, and if you misbehaved again, it turned to red and you had to go to the principal's office. \n\nMy teacher had just gone on a rant a couple days prior to the following incident about getting permission to use the bathroom. We had a bathroom in our classroom, so before this rant we would often just get up and go. But she changed the policy so that students were no longer allowed to get up for any reason without raising their hands and getting permission first.\n\nNow this particular day, I was sitting on a yellow card. I don't recall what I did to deserve it, but I really, really didn't want to end up with a red card. Sometime after lunch my stomach began feeling uneasy, really uneasy. I knew I didn't have much time before my lunch was going to come back up. I raised my hand and covered my mouth, thinking that would be a hint that this was an urgent matter. The teacher saw me, but as she was in the middle of reading something, refused to call on me. I began waving my hand, again, trying to indicate the urgency. Note that blurting out without being called on was also grounds for changing a card color, so I didn't want to just say what was going to happen. \n\nAt this point, I can't hold it in any longer. It's important to note that I sat in the front right corner of the classroom and my desk was right up against the teacher's desk. It ended up being covered as the teacher's jaw dropped and she looked at me in shock. I ended up going home that day early (obviously) and my card stayed yellow. Her policy was then amended to allow students to get up without penalty if they were sick. \n\ntl;dr: Teacher was very strict about students raising their hands before saying anything or getting up from our desk for any reason. I felt sick, and not wanting to get in trouble I raised my hand to try to tell her. She refused to call on me despite my physical cues it was urgent, so I vomited all over her desk, which was right in front of mine.",

Not just unlocked (which this roomie also has a history of doing), not just ajar, it was like 50% open. At **11 at night**.\n\nMy first thought is I'm **pissed** because who is so negligent to leave a door OPEN especially when there is a cat inside (mine) who could walk right out the door and get run over, scooped up by someone, or get just lost. Plus we could get robbed but you can't replace your pet like you can replace your tv.\n\nSince everyone is in bed (three other roomies) I text everyone, \"Who used the front door last? It was totally open.\" Two roomies that I believe text back it wasn't them. I believe them because when they make a mistake or do something you don't like they will own up to it and apologize. Like reasonable people they will listen to you to come up with a solution.\n\nThird roommate isn't home and texts back that she double checked it was closed (uhhhh sure?) and if it's open just close it. \n\nSo do you think this doesn't require someone to remind everyone to remember to close the door? \"Just close it.\" She doesn't understand how serious something like LEAVING THE FRONT DOOR OPEN can be when you live in a city. \n\nI text back saying \"I'm saying something out of protection for my cat, I would be beyond upset if something happened to her. It isn't a big deal just keep the door closed.\"\n\nWhen she does get home at midnight she decides what I texted means I want to argue with her. She has a history of this, too, of feeling personally attacked for the smallest things. \n\nInstead of saying, Oh I'm sorry i must've not closed it hard enough, she aggressively tells me, \"Just close it! Why are you singling me out (*I wasn't, but when two others already text it wasn't them then who else could it have been? Especially when it would be irregular for either other roommates to leave the house at night*) in the group chat just close it!\"\n\nI keep telling her I don't want to argue, I work 12 hours the next day, can we talk about this tomorrow, *I don't want to argue I don't want to argue*. It isn't a big deal that warrants an argument. \n\nShe says, \"If you don't want an argument just close the door-\"\n\nSay no more! I slammed my bedroom door right in her face.",

        "text": "This happened many years ago to a friend of mine.\n\nHe was going shopping at a local grocer, and outside, he was approached by a bunch of kids, maybe 14-15 years old. The showed him a handful of mixed coins which they had scrounged up, and asked if he could buy them some beers (legal age for buying beer in Sweden is 20).\n\nHe was hesitant, but they said: \"We just want it for the taste, not to get drunk!\".\n\nSo, he agreed, took their money, and used all the money to buy them alcohol free beer. Not even light beer, completely alcohol free (which they could have bought themselves).\n\nThey weren't happy about it, but he reminded them that they only wanted it for the taste, not to get drunk.\n\nSo, they probably had to scrounge up some new coins, and try to find someone else to buy beer for them. Or, as kids that age tend to do, just pretend to get drunk anyway...",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster, etc...\n\nI recently dropped out of uni and have started working FOH at a chain bar/grill while I look for a long-term job. This particular location had a few managerial issues before I joined and is severely understaffed.\n\nThe new manager (M) was hired at about the same time as I was and the assistant manager (AM) has only been there a few days, and has already made a name for herself for just being difficult.\n\nM had literally been working 15+ hours a day for every day since she started, because she was so invested in sorting the pub out, and there weren't enough staff available to allow her time off. \n\nI wasn't meant to be working on Easter Sunday but I offered to come in to help out in the evening, partly so M could have a break, and partly so I could have some company (the rest of my house had gone home for the holidays). Obviously she appreciated that and pencilled me in for 6-11:30. \n\n11:30 finish is just a number to put on the rota. The unspoken rule is you go home when everything is done, no matter how late. You get paid for the time though so I'm not bothered. I don't really sleep much and money is money, so it suits me well.\n\nNaturally, Easter Sunday was packed, and two people called in sick in the morning, so it was hectic all day. When I arrived, it was only me, AM and a coworker (C) on FOH.\n\nC ran the bar all evening, and I ran plates back and forth, made desserts and dealt with all of the nonsense that comes with working in hospitality, while AM \"helped out wherever necessary\". Unfortunately we were busy enough that I only had time to wash plates/cutlery when we ran out of something (usually we have a potwasher but she called in sick).\n\nThis meant we had a huge pile of plates gradually building up in the kitchen and no time to wash them. I was in charge of cleaning the kitchen that night and I knew it would be a late one, which was fine. I went to AM and asked if I could order food and take my break at about half 8 (kitchen closes at 9, bar closes at 11).\n\nWhere I am, you are legally entitled to 20mins break every 6 hours.\n\nThis is how our conversation went - \n\nMe: Hey, do you mind if I take a break now while it's not too busy?\n\nAM: *looks at rota* No you're not working long enough to get a break, get back to work.\n\nMe: But-\n\nAM: Don't \"but\" me, we're paying you for 5 1/2 hours, you'll work for 5 1/2 hours.\n\nFair enough.\n\nI went back to work, spent the next few hours cleaning tables and started on the immense pile of washing up. On a usual day, bar clean-up and kitchen clean-up finish at a similar time but  even on a usual day, kitchen clean-up is a three man job. \n\nSo come 11:30 I wasn't anywhere near done with the washing up. I went to see AM who was \"helping\" close the bar and told her I was heading out. I went to get my coat while she checked I had done the kitchen properly. When I got back she was waiting for me, quite clearly unhappy with me.\n\nAM: Where do you think you're going? The kitchen is a mess, you're not leaving until it's done.\n\nMe: Sorry, I'm being paid for 5 1/2 hours, I'm working for 5 1/2 hours.\n\nAM: Wha- No you don't go home until everything is done.\n\nI went home.\n\nUsually, C and the chefs would have helped out in the kitchen when they had finished with their stuff but I let them know what I was doing and they decided to leave it all for AM as she had been on their case as well.\n\nApparently she was washing dishes until 2:30am.\n\n\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\nEdit 2: Wow, this blew up. For all those asking, yes I do still have my job. I get on pretty well with my manager so after I explained my side of the story she took my side. AM is still working there as well and honestly has been better since then. I think she's learnt not to mess the staff about. ",

As we walked past, they jeered \"what's your number\", and much to my friends embarrassment I promptly turned around, went up to the group, and said \"so who wanted my number?\". They seemed a bit flabbergasted, but took down my number and I went on my way. Later that night I was getting texts from my new friends that read \"r u a slut\" \"u want a 3sim\" and other things of the like. They made one mistake though. They rang me from a landline. I rang back and one of their mothers answered who I then told their son and his friends was asking me for sex and asking if I was a slut. She apologised, then I heard her in the background shout \"who's been ringing a girl named Manskins for sex?!\" I could hear a bunch of young boys denying everything and then blaming each other for the sex comments lol. She came back on the phone, and said her boy was in a lot of trouble. ",
