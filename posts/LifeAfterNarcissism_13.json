        "text": "I apologize for the wall of text, just trying to provide some background.\n\nMy late mother was oh-so-very-much NOT a narcissist, as compared to my father, who is.  She spent most of their marriage keeping him from indulging in the worst of narcissistic behaviour, but she couldn't stop all of it.  With a LOT of therapy in my 20's - my Dad's narcissism is a huge reason I went through a very serious suicide attempt - I developed much better boundaries with my family. And after the death of my mother about a decade ago, I've gone low-contact with my family.  My sibling relationships aren't the best - they take after my father, and one sister in particular seems to feel that anytime she can take the opportunity to make herself look like the \"best daughter\" at my expense is an opportunity that can't be missed.  (That sister is pretty much a textbook narcissist.)  \n\nSo here's why I set up a burner and I'm here today.  My husband finished his PhD several years ago.  He was working on it while also working a full-time job that involved a lot of travel. As you might imagine, it took a very long time (nearly a decade), and it was hellaciously stressful on our marriage.  There was a lot of marriage counseling after he was done, because his anxiety over the process did a lot of damage to our relationship. But with a large amount of effort on both our parts, we have moved past this and are feeling better about our relationship than we ever have.  So we are finally ready and excited to take the month-long trip to Europe we have long talked about as a celebration of the completion of his PhD.   \n\nDue to the length of this trip - we wanted plenty of time to get over jet lag and really enjoy the trip - we can't visit with my family in our usual annual summer get-together.  There's simply not enough leave this calendar year to do both.  I phrased this realization very carefully to my family months ago - including the part where this big trip will be the first vacation we've taken by ourselves without family involvement from either side in nearly 20 years - and they all said they understood and wished us well.  Yesterday, however, my father's second wife threw a grenade into this situation, and I'm PISSED.  \n\nThe wife - younger than my father by a significant margin and with him for less than 5 years - is also narcissistic. In the short time she's been with my father, I have already clashed with her once or twice. Basically, I will call my father on his sh\\*t, and she doesn't like that I \"upset\" him. Apparently it's okay if he's a total b\\*stard to me, my sibs, or my niblings, but I'm not supposed to stand up to him about it. As my mother's daughter, that dog don't hunt, and there is a LONG history of me standing up to my Dad that predates the second wife's relationship with him by decades. Suffice it to say, I am certainly not her favorite of my father's children/in-laws.  \n\nMy Dad has a quasi-benchmark birthday coming up this year, which is going to be the first time since they've been together that this has happened.  So the wife decided on the spur of the moment last week that what needed to happen this year is that \"we\" - meaning her, my siblings, and myself - should throw him a big surprise party.  And she started the planning process with one of my sisters, who yesterday included me on a group text, letting me know I needed to help and start planning for the trip. I immediately replied - in a pretty calm manner - that the same problem as to why we couldn't visit the family over the summer still applied...namely my husband and I will have no vacation leave after our now fully-booked trip, and I'm still finishing up the planning for our trip in a few months.  I suggested that maybe that we could just get a group present or make it a real surprise and do the party in early 2019 so my husband and I could participate, but no one has even replied to those suggestions.   (My father's birthday lands somewhere in the middle of the end-of-year holiday season - I'm not sure how many people they think will actually be able to travel for this event as they are planning it, since it's a pretty busy time of year on most people's social calendars and flying isn't the cheapest that time of year anyway.)  \n\nNow let's be clear - I will not be going to this birthday party if it's in 2018, and I am long-used to being the family scapegoat as far as \"not caring\" goes.  A fact I find grimly amusing, as they have all conveniently forgotten I was my late mother's primary care-giver during her terminal illness, at the expense of my career.  (Theirs are all fine, because they all reneged on helping out as they had initially promised.)  I am so completely the daughter that doesn't care about her parents. (◔\\_◔) /s  \n\nBut what I'm really pissed off about?  Within my family, this trip will no longer be the trip that celebrates my husband's achievement and is a well-deserved break for the both of us.  It will be that \"selfish\" trip we decided to take instead of being there for my Dad's relatively impromptu birthday party.  Once again, I'm going to be the daughter that \"ruins\" something for the family, when there are so many ways this could be handled to accommodate my logistical issue. But those don't fit his wife's idea of what she wants to happen, so none of them will happen.  And any time we talk about what should be an incredibly exciting part of our lives, it will be thrown up as an example of how we're \"horrible\" children.    \n\n\nAll I wanted was one great set of memories that wasn't somehow tainted by my family's massive selfishness or my husband's anxiety, and I thought through incredible patience and careful planning on my part, I'd finally managed to make that happen. Now, that's no longer a possibility...and I have a sneaking suspicion this was very intentional on the part of my father's wife.  Because she has mentioned multiple times that she's jealous of our destination - while she's pretty well traveled, she's always wanted to go to our destination but hasn't had the opportunity.  I find this fact a bit suspect in the larger scheme, especially since my Dad went to the same location with my late mother, and he has been surprisingly supportive of us taking this trip. (I think he conceded the point that my husband and I haven't been on a just-the-two-of-us trip since our honeymoon, and recognized my siblings are constantly skipping out on family occasions to take vacations of their own.)    \n\nI am deep into middle-age, as are my siblings (and his wife, who is not much older than any of us).  So I'm trying to figure out: does this BS ever end?  Is there ever a time when narcissistic people ever accept that it's not necessary to create drama, then blame it on someone else who had nothing to do with creating the drama, and who subsequently offer reasonable solutions to fix the drama they created?  I accepted long ago that I will generally be the scapegoat as to why any family occasion \"goes wrong\" - it's amazing how I'm blamed for things that happen when I'm not even in the same state and haven't talked to anyone in months - and usually I just sort of float along with it. But every once in a while, this kind of situation is inane, hurtful, seemingly targeted, and completely unnecessary...like now. I'm just tired of expending emotional energy over this nonsense - I feel like it shouldn't be necessary anymore.  \n\nAll the joy I've had over the last few weeks as the final details of our big trip have come together has evaporated inside the past 18 hours.  It'll come back, I'm sure, but there will always be a small part of this trip that is now spoiled for me.  Even after all the therapy and with the high levels of empathy I possess, I just don't understand why my family can't let me have one...nice...thing.  ",

        "text": "Okay so to add some context: my mum and ndad split up in 2011 (or rather, he forced a divorce on her since he found someone else, she wanted to end it a decade before). Whenever something has happened that upsets him, he used to refuse to pay to maintenance support for us, his 3 biological kids. He used money to control and harrasss my mother who was too ill to work. He also mentally and emotionally (and physically) abused all of us, including my older sister (his stepdaughter), who he refused to believe when she admitted that his dad (My father's father) molested her.\n\nFast forward to this year; my older sister (his former stepdaughter), I and my brother have all cut him off. Mum can work again and has been managing a cafe. The only one who talks to him is my little sister. He lies and says this sister can go with him, his stepsons and his wife to a wedding. They don't take her and blank her phone calls and texts the whole weekend. Sister decides this is the last straw and decides to end the relationship.\n\nMy father goes as far as offering her a new car. Sister decides not to take any of it. And since she's 18, he can't make mum to push her back to him because we're all financially independent from him.\n\nI'd like to think this is karma. If there is such a thing anyway.",

I am concerned it would look as if I am the unhinged one - as I have been emotionally unhinged by it all. Where as the Narcs are dead inside and thereby can evoke a state of mental calm and mental control. \n\nThe most I said to one friend who knows both myself and the family was 'Time will tell'. I have not contacted cousins or any other family members. I am not close enough to any of them, plus there is the same concern that I have not recovered enough to put forward the truth effectively. \n\nSo currently I am running with the theory that the main head Narc in the family will do themselves in, reputationally, as they are aging and will over time reveal more of their horrible self to more and more people.. Whereby surrounding people will, in time, see why I left the abusers, and the toxic brainwashing they caused to the rest of the family. \n\nHow did you deal with friends and other family members? Did you call out the abuse? Or did you say nothing and let it reveal itself in time - via the deteriorating Narcissist or Narcissists? If you sought the latter, did it actually happen? Did the Narc(s) fall asunder of their own accord - thus clarifying the truth of your plight as scapegoat to other friends and family? \n\nAnd does the golden child ever snap out of the trance? Is there a greater likelihood the golden child will wake up to the abuse given the amount of support and information online in this day and age?\n\n",

I’m having real issues at work because I have no idea how to be “proactive” and can’t function without being told exactly what to do so I can get it “right” to avoid being screamed at (not that my boss would ever so much as raise their voice at me) and have spent my whole life being conditioned to essentially stop existing when the person in control didn’t need me and to just sit silently until called upon. Coupled with my ADHD my professional life is a mess right now and spiralling out of control and I have no idea where to even begin trying to sort that mess out whilst I’m freaking out about my personal life.\n\nI’m 26 and only a few weeks ago I finally figured out that I actually do have hobbies and passions (using the Ikagi Venn diagram really helped) and now I finally have a vague direction in my life to work towards that *I* want to do. Now when I’m home alone I don’t watch TV that I think I am “allowed” to watch by a non-existent authority figure, I just watch whatever I want - this was such a massive step for me as I have a panic attack every time I try to do what I actually want to do.\n\nIt’s annoying because my boyfriend thinks that I am always trying to do whatever I want to do and doesn’t understand that in my head we’ve had an argument about it and I’m already compromising everything based on what I think he wants to do based on the imaginary argument so I feel like I spend my whole life compromising and thinking about everyone else because I’m just trying to avoid a fight that wouldn’t even happen because my boyfriend is a normal person and so in reality I just seem self absorbed which is so frustrating.\n\nI’m struggling with the idea that I just want to disappear off the face of the earth for six months and figure out who I am with no input from anyone and then come back as a fully functioning human being but my friends and boyfriend probably wouldn’t appreciate it! \n\nI also feel like because my childhood was essentially skipped over so I could raise my brother and parent my parents I never got a chance to use all that spare time you have as a kid to pursue hobbies and practise talents - I’m left with what feels like an empty husk of a person.\n\nNot 100% sure where I was going with this but I wouldn’t be surprised if most of you can relate to one point or another and it’s just nice having a “safe space” to vent to as I find putting words to my feelings helps me figure stuff out and I have a therapy session later today so I can pretty much just read this out to her! \n\nThanks for listening!",

        "text": "... and he was doing really well with swimming, he got his and Mom away from the property so there's no daily drama, even just took a different route and called police and alerted the local version of APS when she tried to camp in her car on the street in protest... it was quite weird but he handled it like a champ \n\nunfortunately his brother who was behaving like his ally has just screwed him over and I'm not sure if that's what Set It Off, I'm a bit concerned cuz I had never met his brother but where he's living is not the greatest there's constant infestation and repair problems because it's owned by an alcoholic who keeps inviting alcoholic friends to stay and got to the point he was quite concerned that his stuff might be stolen and the drinking might cause an argument, especially since he grew up with an abusive  alcoholic N father,  so I said well as maybe going to your brother's an option.  \n\n\nI never met this brother  but my boyfriend felt he was  a safe choice  and I thought getting out of that bad living environment  my help  but now I feel horrible for suggesting it but what's done is done. there's no way I could have known his brother would turn around and do this but  he's freshly escape from one N and just Fallen victim to another and we all know none of us thinks  very well  when we've gotten conned... his accepted it intellectually that people suck butt emotionally it's really messed with him he's a lot darker and more self-loathing and I have ever scene weave been going out since late April.\n\n  And it was no fault of his own his brother was honestly acting helpful and playing the long con I didn't even see it and I feel terrible  cuz  I'm too far  a way to be any use since he refuses  to accept help from outside the toxic family ( but that's another issue, so they've given up on that and just try to be supportive verbally, the problem is he's completely shutting down communication and without communication there is no way to be supportive and honestly there really isn't much of a relationship \n\n\nhe's just in house hermit / isolates self-loathing / been rejected now doing the rejecting / depressive anxiety kind of mode if that makes sense\n\n\nplus he's just started doing courses through work to try to get promoted, so he was completely offline due to a broken phone and laptop for the last 3 weeks and he says it gave him a lot of clarity but I'm worried it's actually giving him a chance to make a little Echo chamber cuz he still has an awful lot of narcissist fleas like projecting short temper, avoidance, and he's usually quite good at catching them but without inside and outside input he seems to spiraled an awful lot.\n\n\nSo now he says he needs to go back on having a committed relationship and just go back to the Friends area, no end to date provided which is not acceptable to me ... even the last few weeks without him having Communications and refusing anybody outside the family try to help was intensely difficult and painful for me, also I've got a lot of medical stuff going on that I could really have used the support, and one of my triggers from my rbn background is not knowing what's happening and not knowing if or when something will happen... abandonment issues suck and chronic pain doesn't help. I know he gets this cuz unfortunately he's had an accident that he's got a lot of chronic pain and like me it's taking a long time to get it fixed.\n\n Plus I'm terribly upset he never even bothered to listen to me, he said straight up that he hadn't read anything  I had  send  that he just needed to get this out. And it's pretty clear in his message that he lost all context, which she tries to make excuses about he doesn't have much experience with women which is not terribly true he was previously engaged and living with someone although she turned out to be an alcoholic so I'm wondering if having found a functional relationship is just too weird and not traumatic enough? But also all kinds of stuff about over hates himself, saying what he (incorrectly) has decided I  think about him and his actions... so I tried to say is nicely as possible that he's projecting and Echo-chambering and doing the all-or-nothing thinking, cuz I used to do very similar when I first got free so I asked him to speak with his therapist and can we talk friday and he's agreed to that...  \n\nAlthough my situation was slightly different, and since I've done a hell of a lot more therapy then he's had time to do yet (he's a few years younger than me, so he's the same age I was when I realized and reacted pretty much the same way but I don't want to come across as trying to teach or especially not being condescending like been there done that got the T-shirt, I want to be supportive but he needs to find his own way) but I honestly don't know how to say that with out getting critical or angry because I do love him and I do want to fight for this relationship but I think this is one time that fighting is only going to make it worse but that's the only way I I know, I'm afraid I've only got As far as seeing what bottles are worth fighting but I haven't quite got as far as developing extra skills, I do the same thing and just hermit myself in my home and avoid everybody and everything until I feel like I can manage again.\n\nBut just upset cuz it looks like our relationship is about to be a casualty for real... which I thought everything was going very well, I was unsettled about the lack of support and the different views on money.... but he's never pulled some of these Nfleas out before and now I'm really nervous. He sent a couple text messages after I asked to wait till Friday because it's pride in my neighborhood it's crazy and because it's my birthday and I've got medical stuff and my brothers have some things going on that I thought taking another week just to decompress and figure things out would be good but I actually had to say at one point please respect my boundary of Friday and stop texting me back cuz it was a lot of justifications and self-pity and it really started to feel manipulative...\n\nEg  him trying to dump me with this message and when I wound up seeing the message but calling him because I couldn't hear it and then hearing the message afterwards it's very manipulative because he says oh you must think this is me and I hate myself for this in the Hat but I have to do this this and I'm sorry I played with your heart and all this stuff that really doesn't sound like him it honestly sounds like his descriptions of his parents.\n\nSo we've  set  to talk on  Friday so he'll have a chance to play the message he left me for his  therapist because it's  oh gosh  classic r b n / a c o n  issues all over it... I've never come across him projecting so badly even presuming to tell me the kind of boyfriend he thinks I need... like I think I know dude ( his culture is definitely more blatantly Macho and bossy toward women than mine, unfortunately it tends to show up at Bed times so I didn't say that out loud I just said it's a bit presumptuous to tell someone else what they're thinking and feeling cuz you're not them you're not in their heads so he agreed that was logical but that's just another example of the severity of the fleas and behavior like he's really regressed and it's very strange and then settling, but that's why I think that this is fixable cuz he is willing to talk at least on Friday and hopefully by then he can see his therapist and decompress a bit cuz it really sounds like he's speaking from a place of fear almost\n\nI also mention to him that he's saying he's communicating but he's really announcing these decisions he's made without any input from me and the I'm trying to support him getting ahead but suddenly he's acting like I'm trying to tear off his wings and hold them back because he hasn't actually spoken with me about this issues and insecurities and he had some positive content in terms of goals but he decided that I would already be against that and I'm totally not so I really shocked trying to understand stand like would he even think that about me I'm totally not that kind of person so it's got to be coming from somewhere else.\n\nAnyway it's an LDR situation on top, so we all know there's no relationship without communication anyway, so I really don't know what to do. \n\nAnyway he probably doesn't sound too great in this story but he's been extremely supportive of me and my disabilities and a bad situation that I had when we had first met and we met by phone before scene each other and so I think communicating was one of our strengths before and even after we saw each other he said he still thought were compatible and I very much think so I very much think this relationship is worth keeping and developing even though we both have a lot of baggage and I guess he has more baggage than I expected. I'm just really shocked at the behavior and I want to try to get it through to him I'm hoping he'll realize on his own before Friday talking to his therapist, and from what I know of his finger quotes normal friends they're quite concerned as well that this isn't really him this is a reaction and likely an overreaction. But I have a lot of issues as well and I have to put my own gas mask on before I can help him with his so I just don't know what to do and I'm not good at being diplomatic about this stuff either. Anyway any advice appreciated if I don't answer right away it's probably cuz I met doctor's most of the week. But I'm I will read and reply as soon as I can thanks",

Today is one of those days, and I’ve had them before. They seem to be more prevalent when I’m confronted with something big (an indication of their abuse; finding out that they were neglectful when I was a toddler, or having a flashback that indicated that my dad might have touched me inappropriately) or something unclear. The fog sets in, making the memories hard to get to, and the doubt comes with it. Even my SO reminding me and trying to convince me don’t work well, because I feel he’s just heard my memories (what if they’re not real and I made them up). \n\nI’ve spoken to my therapist about it, and have been told to keep reminding myself that I did leave and I don’t want to go back, nor that I regret it. But sometimes that doesn’t help very well. Does anyone have any advice? ",

I made my first post on this sub a couple weeks ago and found it very therapeutic for my situation. I have dealt with three Narcissists in my life, one of them a family member, one an ex, and most recently, a best friend of 5 years. This last situation had utterly shocking revelations come to light and I have truly been struggling with it. It's been the most traumatizing situation out of all 3, even more so than my abusive ex. I am realizing that holding onto this anger and bitterness is only making me this person's prisoner.\n\nI came across a quote that touched me so deeply by Nelson Mandela. Though his situation was regarding being actually wrongfully imprisoned, I still found it so helpful for me and I look at it almost every day to help me in my most current situation.\n\n**\"As I walked out the door to the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison.\"**\n\nI am now free from my Narc, I am on my way to peace and utter freedom, I have the potential for an amazing life without this person in it. But if I cannot let go of the hate, bitterness, and pain in my heart, I will never truly be free of them. They will continue to haunt me long after they are gone if I can't love myself enough to unburden my heart and  leave behind these thoughts that in the end, harm only me and not them.",

I've un-learned some, but I have more work to do. Sometimes I feel very afraid that its hopeless. Sometimes I worry I'm exactly like her. People say \"Well if you're aware of your behaviors then you're not like her...\" But that simply isn't true. If you have an addict parent, and grow up to have an addiction, even if you're aware that you learned shitty coping skills from your parent, that doesn't stop them. Knowing your self-centered parent taught you to be self-centered doesn't make you a good person. So it scares me. I've seen her bawl her eyes out on the bathroom floor about how her life sucks and everyone hates her, just like me. I feel guilty when I get sad, that its just a narcissistic pity party. So I've always wondered. I know my behaviors suck. I don't know how to change. Does she? \n\n\n\nI finally got my answer. I don't see her often, but I did the other day. She told me a story about driving somewhere with a couple. The husband was road raging a bit, and his wife sat there. My mom wondered why she didn't give him directions. For reference, whenever my parents are in the car, my dad drives and my mom screams at him every time a red light appears. (My dad is a capable driver who's never been in an accident.) \n\nI always assumed her emotions just got the best of her, like me. No. She literally was baffled as to why someone WOULDN'T bark orders at their already angry loved one. She thought that was the normal and appropriate response, and this woman was strange for not doing it. I'm not sure if this means my mother is deeply in denial about her behaviors, or simply stupid.

        "text": "**This will contain SPOILERS, and if you haven't watched it, I highly recommend you do! It's a great movie!**\n\nSo my best friend and I have been watching a ton of David Lynch movies together lately. I was remarking how in the film Fire Walk With Me, Lynch really nails the feelings of hopelessness and loneliness that abuse victims struggle with, especially as teens. However the abuse I experienced was not quite as brutal as that of Laura Palmer. Don't get me wrong, there was definitely a lot of screaming and violence, especially when I was a little kid, but around age 11 or so, my parents decided I was too old to \"spank\" anymore, so verbal abuse and neglect were more prevalent as a teen/preteen. \n\nIn Eraserhead, a man in his early 20s gets a casual dating partner pregnant. The two reluctantly get married, and his new wife moves into his house. The man's apartment is in horrible condition. It's just one small room with the bed taking up most of the space. There are a few places where he has just mounds of dirt, not potted or anything, from which a dying plant is growing. This kind of shows us that this guy has no idea how to nurture anything--not himself or a baby. The baby turns out to be severely deformed, refuses to eat, and is constantly crying. The baby slowly drives him deeper into despair until, it can be interpreted, that he kills the baby and himself. \n\nI feel like that's how my parents were. They were both abused themselves. They didn't really love each other, but got married because my dad is too submissive and every time he tried to break up with her, she just kinda refused to leave. I was a fussy, premature baby with a lot of medical problems. My earliest memories are of my mom screaming at me at the top of her lungs just because I was playing too loudly or talking too much--normal toddler stuff. The older I got, the less effort my parents put into nurturing. The house became filthy and broken down until, when I was a teenager, it was not legally habitable. Eventually DCFS got involved and forced my parents to move to a better house. My brother wasn't educated at all from second grade to 10th grade. We never had clothes that fit us properly or that didn't have holes in them. We were maybe bought two outfits per year at Christmas. I've been obese since I was a toddler, and both my parents are over 400 pounds. It's like the life was sucked out of them. They probably weren't very happy with their lives to begin with, and adding a couple of children to the mix only overwhelmed them until neglect pervaded the household. \n\nWhat really gets me is that, unlike the main character from Eraserhead, my parents chose parenthood. My mom was actually infertile, and she had to be on fertility treatments (which are very expensive) for YEARS to conceive. I guess she didn't really know what she was getting into...",

        "text": "There’s no name for this particular brand of abuse I think yet? I’ve read a lot of the books so please enlighten me if I’m wrong. \n\nHere’s my experience with this in a nutshell:\n\nHe stayed up all night on benzos. I had been raped within the last month and so was no longer the clingy needy one to his usual disinterest. I withdrew, and he then clung back on to me and love bombed. However, it couldn’t work this time. I wasn’t ready to be close to any man yet. So he was deficient and severely narc injured by my lack of affections. \n\nHe woke me up with a break up later. Then he came at me yelling for me to leave, I wasn’t ready or strong or smart enough to end it yet tho and asked if we could just talk after kids when to school. He then attacked me and hit me, in front of his daughter. This was the first and only time he hit me. I didn’t have ANY boundaries, but he crossed the one and only one I did have. So I was done! \n\nSo after the kids were at school, I came back to start packing my things. When he saw I was serious about leaving and not begging to have him back like I usually did every time he broke up with me before, he grabbed one of the 4 loaded guns in the house (2 are mine) and I happened upon him sitting in the fetal position with all of his clothes on in the shower with a gun loaded with not one but two bullets. It was also cocked as it was a revolver and the hammer was back, his finger on the trigger. \n\nWhen I first happened upon him he didn’t see me so I somehow was able to use the opportunity to take 3 pictures of the scene of him sitting in the shower there. I tried to talk it out of his hands, I thought he might kill me too so I even panicked and tried to grab it at which his flinch made me panic more. So I called 911. Once they got me to come out, he hid the gun in the house and unloaded it. Then came out and gave himself over to swat. They took him to a hospital and he only had to stay 48 hours in psych, then was set back free.\n\nThis was obviously a last resort to try to get me to stay, and to continue to traumatize me through my empathy. I was lost and confused right after but went no contact almost immediately, and educated myself on everything to do with this disorder. Since then he still stalks and harasses me.\n\nAnyone else experience the suicide game from theirs? What’s your story please share? What should this be termed, if it is relatively common with them. (Honestly, wondering how common it is so that’s another reason to ask y’alls experiences.)",

My NSis is about to leave for America! She naively believes that marrying her boyfriend will gain her a citizenship. I couldn't be happier.\n\nPrior to this - as maybe hinted at in my previous posts - I've attempted to have some degree of sympathy for her as another result of my parents' broken, sorry excuse for an upbringing. She is a clearly mentally ill individual, and if I regret anything, it's not helping her to find therapy.\n\nBut, yeah, I'm done with her now. As she prepares to swan off into her inevitable crash-and-burn, she has decided that her latest installment in \"the last word\" (i.e., harassment attempts) should be a 5-minute-long video accusing me (among other things) of being complicit in her sexual assault, of last year. \n\nYes, that's right, folks. Instead of alerting the police or anyone who could have helped her, she went to me, and I failed to either prevent said event or make it all better afterwards. Apparently - as the family keep telling me - she has \"always been there for me\", and I have not reciprocated.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a vile lie. I can recall, vaguely, her contacting me at the time she stated; if she reached out, she communicated very poorly. As horrible as what happened to her might have been (she is a chronic liar and I can't be sure of anything she says), it is laughable that I be forced into the Scapegoat position for it. As opposed to, say...the actual perpetrator...?\n\nMy partner, having born her share of my NSister's harassment and melodrama, has lost any sympathy for her. Now, finally, I have done the same. To my family, I am losing my \"best friend\"; to my partner and I, we will be rid of one less source of frustration and stress.\n\nI am done. There is no redeeming her. I'm done.",

I know two of my N's use reddit, so I'm using a shiny new account specifically to post for this kind of stuff. \n\nFor this post though, I'll say that I have made a lot of major life changes in the past year, including: getting a divorce, changing jobs, moving, going NC or VLC with N's, and living on my own for the first time in my life. I've also lost friends due to the divorce, had a loved one pass away very recently, and had health and financial issues. \n\nSome days, it seems hard just to breathe, let alone do the things I want to do or know it'd be good for me to do, like volunteer at an animal shelter, find a therapist, go to the gym, join a tabletop RPG, get back in touch with the creative side of me, or date someone new. When it comes to these things, my mind immediately starts in with how I'm not capable or deserving. I sabotage myself, get so anxious I get sick, or spiral downward. I have very few people in my life that I trust now, and some of them don't really understand what I've been through.

I've read Pete Walker's books, Anne Katherine's 'Boundaries', some of Bancroft's 'Why does he do that?' and Vanderkolk's 'The body keeps the score', looked at DBT and IFS therapy manuals on my own. I've read posts that I can identify with, ones that talk of abuse and neglect.  \n\nBut I feel stuck now. I've read plenty, been in my own head plenty, but not reached out to those who might understand. So, I'm hoping someone reads my post, and can give some encouragement or advice. ",

She became far more cruel and usury in a much more deliberate way but being that she moved herself hundreds of miles from me, she turned her abuse on a boy that wasn't even her child but some poor soul she 'rescued'. Which really, she did rescue him from and incredibly dangerous situation, but she had no idea how to care for someone with PTSD and cerebral palsy, or who also happened to be black, Latinx, and gay. She said he was probably gay because he was raped, to other people, in front of him. She made fun of his poofy hair and how much time he spent on it. She jokingly threatened to kill him when he wouldn't put his leg braces on and threatened to not let him see his friends if he didn't go to church. She wouldn't let him watch tv or listen to music because she likes quiet, leaving him to sit in silence, something he did most of the day in his previous abusive environment while he waited to be beaten or raped, and regularly fed him rotten food. She was also charging him rent and for meals at nice restaurants leaving him with just under $80 a month. I found this out in October of this year when I was at her house for a wedding. I went with the intentions of getting past my own hurt and attempting to have fun experiences with my own mother again but those hopes were dashed when I realized what was going on.This was something I couldn't abide though and made me pull the plug. I helped him find legal representation and talked with his friends who were willing to take him in. He's now happy and living with a big family with kids his age and even he says he's sorry I had that woman as a mother.\n\nI was forced into contact with her again in December when my brother went off the rails. He had been staying with friends but when the friends' grandma died they couldn't deal with his constant rambling about bitcoin. Up until I saw him when he arrived at my apartment that's all I thought it was. He hadn't been showering, his teeth were rotting out of his head, he was talking to people who weren't there, completely incoherent, and randomly screaming, crying, and laughing, insisting that he had to tell everyone he was blockchain Jesus and that I shouldn't resist him. Fearing he was a danger to himself and possibly others (he has assaulted people, harmed animals, and destroyed property in the past), I called my local mobile crisis unit and they took him to the mental hospital where he spent a week on risperdol getting care and seemed to be doing better but he's also highly intelligent and was probably just saying what he needed to say to get out. ANYWAY me and my SO spent NYE driving him from NJ to AL to stay with Nmom once he was released because that's where he wanted to go and no one else had the resources to take care of him.\n\nIt took a lot out of me to visit him every day in the hospital and to arrange to pick him up and drive him all the way down there. I was chasing zannies with vodka just to get through my work day and take the train to the hospital to see him without breaking down in tears. I wasn't even half-way compensated for the gas alone it took to get him to AL. She turns around and tells him that he didn't need to go to the hospital or take his pills. That I was just being selfish and didn't want him in my apartment. That I'm into demonology and am an agent of Satan (well that's not completely untrue). And has generally been badmouthing me to anyone who will listen.\n\nI've thought about the horrid things she's done and said and wondered if I will have anything left to feel when she dies. I think I'm going to figure that out sooner than I thought because they say whatever she has is in the lymph nodes now and knowing her 3 pack a day habit I'm figuring it must be cancer. They removed half of her lung yesterday and are waiting on a prognosis. I'm feeling a lot of things that are in conflict right now and just need to get this off of my chest.",

        "text": "Hello all. So with 3+ months of NC under my belt and constant attempts by my NMum to get in touch, I have had a recent proposal by my girlfriend's own mother - a lovely and bright individual who believes in putting compassion first. She knows I'm reluctant to get back in touch with my NMum, as I'm a much happier person with her out-of-the-picture, but she also feels it won't be good for me to stay apart from my family forever.\n\nHer idea is to follow the methodology of the British Royal Family: on a weekly or bi-monthly basis, sending out an email to NMum and EDad, giving the barest facts of how I'm doing. No offers of detailed information or openings to allow them to interfere - just \"I'm alive, I'm drawing a lot, work is fine\", etc.\n\nThis follows the principle of \"Grey Rock\" in that it makes me seem as boring to NMum as possible, and not worth her attention. The other part of the plan is to not respond to anything she sends back, nor even read it, just to protect myself.\n\nA work-friend of mine who has dealt with (and gone NC with) abusive NParents thinks it's a great idea, putting out positivity and rejecting negativity. However, an older friend of mine, who's known me since childhood, gave me two questions: \"*Are you sure you won't read what she sends you*?\", and \"*Does your Mother really deserve to know how you're doing, if she's behaved the way she has*?\". Both food for thought.\n\nSo the other method I'm considering is to do as above, but NMum has one strike and then she's out. Should I get back any kind of negativity to her, I cut her out of the emails and send them only to EDad. \n\n(Helpfully, they're preparing to move far away from us in the next 6 months, so it'll be easier to keep a distance.)\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I setting myself up for disaster here? Is it better to just remain NC?",

        "text": "So it's getting pretty warm where I live and mom broke out the fans to put in all our windows. I didn't even know she had put one in my bedroom window, when we had company over and all heard a huge crash upstairs. We all kind of laughed it off figuring whatever damage was done, waiting until the company left to clean it up wasn't going to make it worse.\n\nSure enough it was a fan I didn't know mom had put in my window that had fallen out onto my computer desk, knocking off my smart tv (which I had been using as a computer monitor) onto my office chair then the floor, shattering the screen.\n\nWhen mom pieced all that together, she got almost angry enough to swear (something she's been working really hard to not do anymore), but right now I'm kind of like, ehh whatever. I'm not sure if it's just cause I don't have the energy to be angry or if it's cause I know I can rig something together to last long enough for something nice to come my way again. Maybe it's just the fact that I feel completely assured that something nice *will* end up in my lap for cheap or free (got the smart tv from my brother in law for really cheap, most of the nice stuff I own I managed to get with good deals or just waiting around til someone just gave it to me if I felt like I didn't need it enough to actually buy it).\n\nWe've never had a fan fall out of a window before. They're specifically designed to go into a window and wedge behind the frame slightly so they *cant* fall. I'm still not sure why it fell. There wasn't even a breeze or anything to unbalance it.\n\nI think mom's more angry about it than I am. I could easily blame her because she had put the fan in the window. But I think she's blaming herself for my broken tv enough already without me saying anything? I'm pretty sure come tomorrow she'll probably offer to help find a good deal on a new tv and split the cost or something.\n\nYou know that uptight feeling in your chest you get when your anxious about something but can't quite pinpoint what it is that's causing your anxiety? I kinda feel like that right now. Just while typing this post I've stopped like three times already to wonder what's causing me to feel anxious only to realize *my tv is broken, I should probably feel angry about that.* but then I'm like *ehh, I don't want to put the energy into being angry. It'll work itself out eventually.*\n\nBut we're also dealing with an extinction burst with ndad right now and I'm wondering if we're all just stressed out about that and not double checking that the fan was secure is just one of those stupid mistakes you make when you're stressed out that should be taken as a sign to just take a deep breath and slow down.\n\nI don't know. I'm just typing this out to figure out where I fall emotionally in this situation, because not being angry about it is kind of new to me.",

        "text": "I'll try to make this short and easy. My grandmother was really my mother- in that she raised me, from basically birth to the time I moved out of my Nmom's household (and even sometimes after I moved out.) She was always closeby, living next door to us for several years and eventually moving in (after I moved out). She protected my siblings and myself from our BPD, Bipolar Nmother. She was also an E because she didn't stop the behavior, she just tolerated it and gave my Nmom whatever she demanded. (Nmom didn't work, clean, anything. Sat around barking orders/being a narcissist all day everyday.) I always told my grandmother to get out, because we could get my younger siblings to safer places and she wasn't safe herself. She took beatings for us. Just to protect us. She sacrificed everything to make sure we turned out ok. I was very, very close to her. I think she was just too afraid to try anything because my Nmom has come close to killing her in the past and she didn't want to get herself or us into that situation again. \n\nThis Saturday will be 2 years since my grandmother passed away. I remember the day like it was yesterday and it still hurts just as much as that day. I held her hand in the hospital as she died. I do place the blame on my Nmom for her death. She worked that woman to the bone and took everything for granted. I have made peace with the fact that my Nmom will never change, but I cannot forgive her for everything she did to my grandmother. Ever. \n\nLast year my Nmom tried to get attention on the anniversary of my grandmother's death. Including posting things about me, and telling people that she knows I wish that she would have died instead of my grandmother. Some of her friends even messaged me to tell me that I should go and support my Nmom during this difficult time and that I shouldn't blame her for my grandmother's death. (Case in point: I do blame her, and I do wish she was the one to go. But I have NEVER vocalized this to her or anyone else besides my SO and now Reddit.) \n\nI feel like even though I am now NC she will try to pull something. I just feel it in my bones. And even though I am NC I feel like I will want to respond to her to tell her to eff off. I don't want anything to do with her on Saturday. I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, maybe I just feel like I needed to vent, or to know if anyone else has dealt with something similar. So if you read this far, thank you for your time! Any advice is of course welcome too. ",

        "text": "My mother has always functioned in our family as my Narcissist father's bitchy assistant, not as an ally and protector of her children. To this day, she enables and protects him, and validates his reality, not that of her adult children, who are survivors of his abuse.\n\nMy mother was my father's enabler, but she was also abusive in her own right, mostly physically abusive. A couple of my stories about her from when I was a child, my therapist said was some of the worst he's heard in 30 years of practice. She was not just a codependent - I've come to see her instead as being the beta N to my father's alpha N, and that they function as a toxic team.\n\nHowever, I hear so many stories of N mothers, and a lot of those stories revolve around the mother being the lying, manipulating, smear campaigning, conniving, scheming, plotting, malicious type of N. My mother isn't like this.\n\nInstead, she simply isn't that interested in her children. Growing up, she didn't have a bond with us, and seemed to regard us as a burden. I never felt close to her, and still don't. She lacks empathy, and can be so cold at times it takes your breath away. She's said things to me over the years that I would definitely qualify as hateful.\n\nI remember one time, years ago, I was home for Christmas, and my mother was drinking. She turns mean when she's had too much to drink. There was a party going on at my parents' house, with lots of friends and family around, and my mother started making inflammatory comments about gay people. She grew up in the South and is homophobic and racist. She knows I don't share her views AT ALL.\n\nSo I end up saying something back to her, challenging her homophobic remarks, and I'll never forget the look of pure hate that came across her face as she scornfully looked me up and down and said, \"Oh \\[Mcginty\\], you're just so fucked up!\"\n\nIf you challenge my N father's delusional N authority, and don't play the role my parents have assigned to you, if you step outside the family script, and especially if you expect my mother to ever go against my father's bullying and demands, that's when she really shows her teeth. She will shame you by becoming icy cold and dismissive. Obviously something is wrong with YOU for not playing your part in the family stage play.\n\nI've realized that my mother doesn't view her children as having a voice, or at least not a voice that is equal to her and my father. I think in her world, we are just not that important. She is not a support person... I would never go to her in a crisis. There is a cold hearted meanness about her that she hides from the world behind an extroverted, super friendly exterior. She's very involved in her church and I think wants to be seen as a religious, charitable woman. In reality, I find her to be one of the most judgmental, emotionally shallow people I have ever known.\n\nShe's mostly fine if you don't see her often, and if you keep your conversations superficial. She likes to talk about books and TV shows. But going to her for emotional support is just not what she's interested in. The lack of empathy becomes glaringly apparent.\n\nI always feel a sense of loss when I see other people commenting on their positive relationships with their mothers. I would kill to have that kind of closeness, or any closeness, with my mother.\n\nDoes a mother have to be a lying, conniving, backstabbing, evil bitch to be a N? Or can a cold hearted lack of empathy and lack of interest in her children, qualify her?",

        "text": "&gt; Dear Valerie,\n\n&gt; Thank you.\n\n&gt; I have done a lot of thinking, a lot of remembering, and a lot of soul searching, and you have done so much for me in my life.  I have not always given credit to you for your help and sacrifice, and I feel it necessary to do so now.  Thank you for instilling a love of language in me.  For giving me the learning opportunities I had.  For financially supporting me, for helping me find friends, for my taste in music.  Thank you for all the food I ate, all the things I ruined, and all the trips I got to take.  I see the cost of my instruments, the lessons, the cruises and trips to Disney World.  Thank you for putting me in a safe learning environment, one that was far and above superior to most public education.  You have done so much for me, and it is hard to overstate how much it has helped me, and how appreciated it truly is.  So I say now, thank you for everything.  It has not gone unappreciated.\n\n&gt;How dare you.\n\n&gt; How dare you scare the living daylights out of me? How dare you praise my accomplishments in public, but berate my failings in private? How dare you make me afraid of failure, so afraid that I would rather stay silent and screw up rather than ask for help? How dare you tell me to be normal, when you know full well I am anything but? Screaming and yelling and breaking things was the only way I knew how you expressed your anger and disappointment. You remember 6th grade, where I didn't turn in a report for weeks that was done and in my backpack, and you had to ask the teacher to kindly let me turn it in for partial credit. Why do you think I didn't turn it in? It was a day late, and I was afraid of the teacher's reaction, because I was afraid of your reactions. How dare you yell at me not five minutes after Dave almost killed you that I should have done something. I was eleven! I left to get away from your yelling, and now it's my fault your husband couldn't take your yelling anymore and snapped? He should\nnot have done what he did, but there was a reason your joint friends and our church took his side; you were abusing him. You abused all of us. How dare you?\n\n&gt; Today I can see all of my failures as clear as day, but I cannot see my accomplishments. I was never enough, and I will never be enough. Got Bs? Why not Honors? Got Honors; why not High Honors? I am always weird and strange because I could never be what you thought of as “normal”, and you couldn't be normal to anybody else either. You drove friends away, and made me ashamed of me, because of you. You made me your co-parent and punching bag in place of Dave, because he was gone. I was elven! I was not any kind of responsible, because any time I did something, I was wrong. I have depression today, not because of the divorce, but because of you. Only you. You made me believe I was not right, not good enough, didn't try hard enough, and in general was not enough. I was not worthy of good things because you so often took them away. I am overly attached to important objects, because you always broke MY stuff when you were mad, not your stuff. I have public anxiety because I never know\nwhen I would be called out and berated for things I had done, or left undone. All attention is negative attention. Praise is just the setup before the list of failures. And all good things can and will be taken away on someone else's whim. I have been to more therapy over you than anything else. Everything negative that has happened in my life is a footnote, but you. You are the reason I am the way I am, and it is your fault. How dare you.\n\n&gt; This letter will be the last time I ever communicate with you. I am done. No more will you darken my memory, or haunt my subconscious. I release you from your position as “Mom”; now you are just Valerie. You are not worthy of that title to me anymore. I will not be involved in your eventual long term care, I will not choose your nursing home, I will not attend your funeral, and I will no longer accept gifts from you. I want no part of your estate, if you have one. This is goodbye. I no longer hate you for what you have done. That emotion disappeared like morning mist as I began to heal. I now pity you for the sad little girl you were, and in many ways still are. I wish no ill will on you; in fact I wish nothing for you. Your bed is made, your grapes are grown, and your fields have been sown. And now the results of your actions are yours to partake of. \n\n&gt; Goodbye Valerie, \n\n&gt; /u/talented_fool\n\nI wrote that letter two weeks ago, and yesterday I finally sent it to her.  I spent the seven dollars to send it registered mail, return receipt to me, so I'll know she got it.  I needed something official to mark the end of an era, the end of our relationship.  Maybe I'm brave for sending it to her, or just crazy for poking the bear I haven't had contact with for two years.  But I feel like it's complete; thirty three years of her influence ends here.  \n\nIt is finished.  And I am content.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Happy Pride Everyone! (it's a season now apparently)\n\nI'm bi/pan and I think I've known since around 8?  Two things always bothered me: why and how did I not feel comfortable coming out to Nmom when her words always *seemed* supportive. I think I've figured it out.\n\nThe why was easy to figure out in retrospect. I went to very catholic schools through out my childhood so while it wasn't unsafe to come out (more don't ask don't tell) it would have required a lot of parental support. Which I wasn't going to get because I am also disabled; an LGBT child in a catholic school is a problem and some of the more conservative parishioners would have blamed Nmom's parenting. But a disabled child? Unfortunate, blameless and a steady source of Nsupply.\n\nThe how was difficult, my Nmom's words were always supportive per se; but I had a definite sense that coming out was a bad idea. I remembered two incidents that I think are illuminating. In the first I'm 12ish, I was in the car with her and I just blatantly told her that sometimes I had same-sex attractions and hetero attractions. She told me this was normal that sometimes she saw a pretty woman and thought about 'what she would do to her'.  Wildly inappropriate and overly aggressive discussion with your preteen. Gross, mom.\n\nThe second incident was later I was maybe 16ish, we were pulling out of the driveway (I'm sure there's a reason all these conversations happened in the car) and she told me she would be fine if I told her I was a lesbian, she'd still love me. But she would need time to mourn the life she had imagined for me and I had to give her space for that. I started to try to argue but she just replied in a tone (y'know the yell/command whisper): I needed to *respect* that.  At the time I wasn't sure why that felt so icky, but now holy batman that's homophobic. \n\nThe overall message here though was that I didn't matter, I was making a big deal about something that didn't really matter and that I was the one being selfish because I wasn't giving due consideration to the impact on her. \n\nThis makes sense to me because it was Nmom's response to other important things in my life (atheism, vegetarianism, politics, disability treatment), but this isn't something that she would have been able to manipulate as easily so my mind had a flight/fight response and just hid that aspect of myself until it was safe.",

        "text": "After decades of abuse, I am just learning about this crazy world of narcissism. It's a learning process to try to comprehend how these people and systems work. I was just reading part of an article I'm pasting below.\n\nI am thinking about the enablers in my life and they are weak and needy in some ways. Those of you who are more acquainted with this stuff than I am, can you tell me if enablers are so hollow inside (at least in some ways) that they need to attach themselves to somebody else's star, somebody else's energy and purpose and dominance, so that they can be validated via the connection to the narcissist? They live in the N's shadow to mooch off of them so that they too can be OK?\n\n&gt;What if the enabler is not you? What if it's somebody else and they will not listen to you when you try to tell them that their behavior is harmful and is in fact perpetrating the problem? This can be a difficult situation, because enablers of narcissists are often living in as much of a **fictitious reality** as the narcissist is when it comes to this. A lot of times, we are talking about a long-term enabler, so the pattern is often very deep and very established. You are likely not going to get through to this person. Their entire identity may be wrapped up in \"helping\" the narcissist and **they are in just as much emotional danger as the narcissist if this pattern does not continue**. They are probably enmeshed with the narcissist, which means interpersonal boundaries are so poor that they cannot tell where the narcissist begins and they end. They may get defend the narcissist, get angry, or simply deny everything. We often hear, \"**I'm doing the best I can!**\" or \"It's not me, it's the narcissist!\" These are both **narcissistic statements** in and of themselves, **spoken by people who don't really want to take responsibility for the things they are doing or change them**. And you already know what that means. It means **it's pointless to even bother**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No contact is still and always will be the best strategy for dealing with narcissists and with their enablers. Again, narcissism cannot exist in a vacuum. **There are** ***always*** **enablers**. When identified, they should be subject to the same rules as the narcissist. If that's no contact, then it is. It's sad that this can result in going no contact with people you love, but they are not protecting you and are in fact **enabling the narcissist to abuse you and others**, so it's up to you whether you think you deserve better or not. Let's hope you think you do.",

        "text": "So, I've gotten my (un)fair share of people steamrolling how I feel about my abusive parents. This is not meant to be gossip, it's a triggered vent in front of people who understand.\n\nThe first one is this friend I have, a neighbour of mine who's a fun dude. He's Nigerian, and is not far from the level of cocky he ascribes to his fellow countrymen. This is fun, and less fun. He's not a narc, but speaking as someone who wants to be friends with him, I'm struggling some with how he treats me at times. I really don't think he means any harm, so I never actually tell him off, I only explain perspective and - weird enough to me - he apologises. Time after time. I just can't deal with his monologues and how he blows off my own experience with abuse to feed them.\n\nHe really likes to be the teacher. That's not a bad thing in general, but it crosses my very sore lines when he repeats and prolongs a monologue about inspirational stuff despite me saying it's condescending when he never stops telling me things I've told him several times I already know. It's even worse when he interrupts me to lay even more inspirational stuff on me.\n\nHe thinks I act mega irrationally when I do something he doesn't understand but I have more than enough personal experience with. One being my parents. It took him some \"please, don't ask\"'s and follow-up explanations for him to stop asking if I've talked to my dad lately. NC, he knows that. What really, really got to me, though, was when we first discussed my evil-and-insane parents and his response to me explaining my NC was: **\"But someday, you will need them.\"**\n\nThe second was my step-grandmother. She has N traits, but no need to go into detail here. She found out they're abusive and says she regrets so much that she didn't intervene. (In all actuality, we don't even keep much contact.) Her response to me changing my number and not telling my parents was: **\"Don't they deserve to know that you've changed your phone number?\"**.\n\nI got two really sweet birthday texts (from people I love), and I told her what's good, and she said, with a smile: **\"Could it be your mum and dad?\"**\n\nSo, second part of the post: She has my new phone number, and I have no real reason to believe she wouldn't pass it forward to Dear Parents. I asked her via WhatsApp but it's nighttime and she's probably fast asleep. I can always block Dear Parents (and grandma, since she would have essentially betrayed me) but who's to say they won't borrow another device? Plus, I just want to have a secret phone number, of my own.\n\nThanks for reading all this, and have a good day.",

        "text": "Background: I'm an only child of a NMom and EDad. EDad has moderate to severe Aspergers and is completely unable to comprehend the situation. He is also blind to any abuse having occurred, and denies it when confronted. He is 69 years old. I am 100% financially dependent on them.\n\nI moved far away from my parents when I left for college, but I'm currently visiting a friend who lives nearby. Because I have my car, I planned to meet up with EDad before leaving and have him transfer over some of my old stuff that I left at their house before leaving for college. I told him I was going to do this ahead of time.\n\nYesterday was father's day. I texted EDad and offered him to meet up, transfer some of my old stuff into my car before I leave, and then have a father's day dinner with him. He denied my offer and said that if I wanted to do *anything* like that, NMom would have to be part of it, and that he wanted me to meet up with her (which I've told him 99999 times that I won't) and have a \"respectful, courteous meeting\" with her.\n\nI asked why NMom would need to be present for such a simple task as moving some items over, and that it made no sense. After a long delay, he replied with a dramatic text about how all his friends and coworkers have been dying of heart attacks &amp; old age, and that his #1 objective is to \"bring the family back together\" before his time comes.\nI did my best to keep my cool, and replied \"I'm sorry, but that won't work out for me\" and told him that he can ship the items, but if they get damaged, I expect compensation for either a repair or replacement (some of them are expensive and fragile.)\n\nSo now I know my emotionally stunted EDad, who has zero grip on the situation in my family and is literally incapable of seeing any other viewpoint than his own, wants to \"bring the family back together\" and refuses to see me if it doesn't involve also seeing my NMom. He won't meet me for instance, at a father's day dinner, or a birthday dinner for him, unless NMom gets to be present. He will not meet one-on-one without forcing me to break NC with NMom. This is new.\n\nAnd at the same time, if I ever bring up the abuse or complain to him about something in the past, he becomes emotionally explosive and demands I respect him. How the fuck am I supposed to respect him if I can't meet him in person without him demanding a \"respectful and courteous\" meeting with NMom?\n\nIt's not that I'm upset I can't go out to dinner with EDad anymore - I'm really not. It's that, as soon as he told me this, I realized I'm not going to see him in person again, and he will die without seeing me again. And I feel hurt and disturbed.\n",

To me understanding, grey rock is about making yourself “boring” to a narc so that they don’t feel compelled to prey on you. Lately, I’ve been wondering if I have been too private or if it’s just my previous lack of boundaries telling me that. I started a new job and I have been friendly, but pretty private. Many of my coworkers display narcissistic and/or toxic qualities. So I’ve been very private. They don’t know much about me other than I recently graduated college and that I came from another state. They all seem very open with each other and some boundaries issues might be at play. So I decided to keep a low profile while still being friendly and “revealing” enough. Am I doing gray rock the right way? Also, should I be practicing gray rock 24/7? Seems to me the best way to avoid or escape abusers, but I feel like I’m not being myself.\n\nBtw, I am very grateful for everyone on this sub! Awesome support and a lot of knowledge!",

We're currently LC and I haven't spoken to her since Mother's Day. \n\nI'm working on setting healthy boundaries and gray rock style replies. My current challenge is that my mom is a vulnerable narcissist and can sometimes get under my skin by talking about how much she misses me, making me feel sorry for her because she's so lonely, and getting nostalgic about how much she loved and adored me when I was a child (before I could think for myself). \n\nI'm trying to brainstorm some good replies for the things I know she will say, because right now I'm very angry and hurt and the things I want to say will likely start a lot of conflict that I don't actually want to deal with. \n\nOne of her favorites is, \"*I just miss the sound of your voice so much. I don't hear it often enough and I took it for granted when you were in my life.*\" \n\nI have trouble with this because while it *sounds* nice, it feels like manipulation to make me call her more often. What I want to tell her when she says this is that I don't call her more often because it's distressing and I hate it, but I don't want to say anything that will increase the conflict. What is a good, neutral, gray rock response to this comment?\n\nAnother really distressing topic she brings up is her retirement. She often starts talking about how she will be all alone after my dad dies and how she has no retirement plan. These are both true because she has chased everyone else out of her life and both she and my dad have mismanaged their finances terribly. When she brings up this topic there is part of me that wants to be terribly cruel and say something like, \"You've chosen to be alone because you've pushed everyone away. That's not my fault.\" but again, I'm trying to go for a neutral gray rock response here. I'm just not sure how to reply in a way that won't cause an escalation. \n\nIn the past, when I've tried neutral responses it seems to have caused her to escalate to telling me something even more distressing to get a rise out of me. For example, if I respond in a neutral way to her saying that she'll be alone after my dad dies, then she will escalate by saying that actually she thinks he has alzheimer's and she's going to end up having to take care of him for years, or something horrible like that. If I don't respond the way she wants, she keeps escalating until I inevitably fall for it. ",

        "text": "I’ve been in therapy for six months or so now and things have been going well. I’ve found memories that I’ve repressed and have realized that things were way worse than I thought they were. I felt I was doing better (maybe I am) until this morning. \n\nI told my partner I was a bit cold as I stepped out of the shower this morning, and he opened his robe to wrap it around me. As he cuddled me, I suddenly didn’t feel like it was my partner anymore, but it was my dad. It crept up slowly; at first it was the feeling of his robe (my dad used to wear one when I was a kid), then the brush of his chest hair. I was trying to stay grounded and so I looked at the robe (the color), my partners chest hair (not grey) and the room around me. But it didn’t work, and when I felt my partner pressed up against me, I told him I wanted to get out of the embrace. After that, I stepped back in the shower and sat in the tub, shaking and crying. This has never happened to me before, and it scared me. \n\nWe ended up talking about how I’ve been feeling and where this came from. Since I’ve gone NC, I have had many dreams of being chased by my dad. Almost all have ended up with him raping me in my dream, sometimes with my mom’s encouragement. Aside from that, my dad has showed up at my house and will probably try again at some point. I have felt immensely scared of that for a long time, partly because I felt he might hurt me. His possible visit doesn’t scare me anymore, but it doesn’t erase the feeling that he might rape me if he got the chance/He felt pushed. \nMy sex drive has disappeared since I’ve seriously considered going NC (and eventually did), as I feel threatened when my partner comes in for a hug, kiss or more. I’ve had times where I was in the mood and the thought of my dad appeared - I felt dirty, ashamed and couldn’t go through with it. \nI told my partner that my mom and dad played a game when I was a teenager in terms of punishing me. My mom would call my dad, even if I had done nothing, so he’d come in and punish me without hearing my side. I’ve spent my entire life fearing my dad getting upset with me, in part because he was unpredictable when he got angry, and because I never knew when that would happen. As a teenager, I’ve spent hours upset waiting for him to come home, and the fear of him raping me crossed my mind at the time. I’ve also had unwanted thoughts pop up every so often since I was younger. It was the same one, very vague, of my dad having sex. I’d never talked about it to anyone before because I felt I must be wrong and disgusting for this to come up in my mind (though I never actively thought it or enjoyed the thought at all). \n\nMy therapist has told me that it’s unlikely for someone to worry about being raped by a parent if there was never any serious indication that it would occur. I’ve been pointed out that I don’t worry about that with other people; that disappointing them or pissing them off might lead to them raping me. But at the same time, I don’t just want to assume something so terrible while I might be wrong.\nThey were covert sexual abusers, and did things from walking in the bathroom and making comments on my body to actually having sex with the door open while we were on holiday (and I was a kid). My dad has made a lot of comments on my looks in the past, and among other things has squeezed my breast at the dinner table with my ex-SO there, and has said that people must’ve thought I was his younger wife. \n\nI know this is a rather loaded topic, and I hope I am not upsetting anyone with my post. I would however really appreciate your view on this, as I’m struggling to figure out what this means. ",

He tried to guilt me for 30 minutes straight about how he let's go of everything difficult about our parents, and let's all the bad just roll off of him and is able to take the good. Explained that there are shitty things in life and that's just what you do. How he was able to reconcile with a childhood friend after they had a falling out in high school when it came to blows (ended in stitches and broken bones) because he doesn't \"hold onto the past\". That he doesn't judge. \n\nI didn't take the bait. \n\nI was able to sit through his speech and genuinely be happy for him. I'm glad he enjoys his parents, and if that friendship means that much, it is truly an accomplishment to work through that much violence where they can hug again. Genuine kudos.

I explained (calmly) how her behavior has affected me long term, how she's not going to change and I'm not asking her to, and how my only option is to distance myself. I then pointed out how every single one of her friends has ghosted her 'out of no where' or cut her off after a huge fight, how her career has been affected, how other family members have cut her out. How I'm not the only one. \n\nI then calmly explained this isn't about me anymore, it's about my kids. He's never accepted the argument of me having self respect, and standing up for what I've been through. But i was able to show how her behavior affected the health of my dog (long story, dog almost died), how she lied and undermined my parenting for both the dog and my 6 month old baby. He tried to counter with how happy it makes him to see nmom dote on his gc son. I again was genuinely happy for them, that probably feels grrat to have someone show so much affection. I didn't take the bait - I held my composure and kept with my agenda.\n\nI also told him some more specifics of abuse and for the first time he shut up and just listened. \n\nAnd he really listened. For the first time in his life he apologized, and said he was really sorry for what I've been through. That understands why I'm no contact. He supports it. ",

I’m careful with money. I’ve paid off all my debt. I’ve saved up and bought a nice new computer.\n\nI have a wonderful partner and we’re getting married in a few months.\n\nI even have a renewed, much healthier relationship with a couple of family members.\n\nI’m good at my job - clients thanked me this week for my hard work and the support I provided. I’m influential in my workplace, and have influenced changes for the better around diversity, inclusion, sustainability, and mental health support.\n\nI got a promotion recently, and am doing a good job of supporting and helping with career development for the person I manage. And it’s been really rewarding watching him grow in confidence and knowledge.\n\nI’m mostly grateful, mostly happy and mostly calm. \n\nTomorrow I’m taking my niece to a museum - she loves dinosaurs.\n\nI feel so grateful for everything I have now. And I feel so proud of myself for fighting and hanging on for all those years - fighting to survive my narcs attempts to ruin me and my life, fighting to overcome depression and suicidal thoughts, fighting to go NC and stick to it, fighting to create a career for myself, fighting for a healthy loving relationship, fighting to find a way through my crippling PTSD, fighting to manage my anxiety. I’ve achieved so much and I feel proud of myself and I really like myself - I’m a kind, funny, smart, tenacious, humble, grateful person. I’m not perfect, I have more work to do. I just wanted to take a moment to recognize how far I’ve come. 8 years ago I was contemplating suicide. I’m so gratedul that I was able to keep fighting. If you’re reading this and you’re someone who’s struggling and can’t see hope - I just want you to know that I felt the same way once, and I’m proof that there is a way. I believe you can find joy, love, self-compassion, and that you deserve these things too. Hang in there. Fight on ACONs! \n\n",

        "text": "I just want to start by saying I understand I don't communicate well with most people. There's a lot of social convention that flies right over my head. It's my shortcoming, and something I have to work on. I have a lot of work to do on myself, and tomorrow once I've had some time to emotionally process, I'm going work on finding a new therapist (we just moved).  \n\n\nBut right now I'm feeling a lot of anger, and confusion. My boss has been acting strangely for the past few days. She had a meeting she wouldn't tell me about (which is unusual), and all of a sudden there was a surprise HR check-in meeting scheduled for this afternoon (I was told yesterday). When asked if this was a routine operation, because I suspected I was about to be reprimanded, she evaded the question.   \n\n\nSo today, we had our meeting and of course it was not called a reprimand, there weren't any forms or things I needed to sign. It is the first time in a decade-long career in public service that I have been taken aside by an HR person to discuss my unprofessionalism. If we're being honest, I've been unprofessional LOADS of times, but not during meetings. If anything, I am at my most professional in meetings.  \n\n\nI tried to handle it as best I could, but I'm so angry. The only thing I did in those meetings was speak from a place of personal truth and conviction--asking questions of the people in administration so we can actually build a better system, one based on caring for the people we serve. My business is in a transitional period organizationally, so there's no better time than now to look at every open crack as an opportunity to build something stronger.   \n\n\nI tried to explain to them that I came from below the poverty line. Adverse childhood experiences? Too many to count. I don't know how to act and talk professional. I'm a woman, but I have a strong, stern, direct tone with most people. I have been called \"commanding\", \"intimidating\", and of course everyone's favorite \"bossy\". You kind of have to be when you're four years old and your stepfather has your brother's hair in his hand, dangling him above the floor, a knife in his other hand, and you're calling 911. You have to be bossy when you speak to the officers about the latest in your mother's suicide threats. But I also cried when these two people sat in front of me and told me that something I said upset someone enough for them to  give some \"feedback\" to HR about my unprofessionalism. When I got home, I thought--damn, I really shouldn't care what someone thinks of me--but I don't like making people feel upset. That's not why I speak up. I speak up because if you're in a position of authority, your responsibility is to the people you serve, not to anyone's ego. I don't want to be right. I want you fight back, to challenge, to inform. Prove me wrong! Apparently this is a bad way to communicate. So I've got some stuff to work on.   \n\n\nI gave up a stable, union-represented position in a bigger company for the chance to move my career forward and make the leap from blue-collar to professional.   \n\n\nBut we deal with mental illness, homelessness, food insecurity on a daily basis in the communities we serve. I'm putting up flyers about free lunches for kids and remembering when we didn't have enough, and how I didn't even know that only eating salad and ramen was bad. I'm helping families connect with emergency housing and legal services and listening to worried parents talk about taking their children out of school. I feel for these people. These are who I fight for.    \n\n\nDuring the meeting, I also mentioned self-diagnosis of autism spectrum behaviors, not as an excuse, but as a possible reason for my communication style (I am not saying I have autism, and I am NOT trying to appropriate anyone else's life or situation, but I am saying I have significant problems with being overstimulated in certain environments and that coupled with severe social anxiety can make it difficult for me to understand social cues--it's almost like I can't even hear them because the room is so loud or the lights are flickering and no one else notices it) and that we can't always expect everyone to react the same way that we do--that not all of us have received the same kind of training from birth on how to be a human. The response I received in return was that I \"have a great vocabulary\". Well, all the words in the world can't help you if you don't know how to make sentences that don't make you sound...unprofessional.  \n\n\nThey did not offer any specifics as to how or why I am unprofessional.   \n\n\nInstead, they asked me if I could think of any ways to improve. If I knew the ways to improve how I am, don't you think I would have used them by now?!   \n\n\nI wish they could see that for the past three months I've felt like I'm crawling in my skin trying to act like I didn't wander in straight out of the trailer park. They don't know that some days it's all I can do to get out of bed and get to work safely without having an anxiety attack about driving on the expressway.  I feel like everyone views me as this...lesion they can't wait to be rid of, and all I'm trying to do is make sure that no other kid feels the way I felt growing up--discarded, unwanted, uncared for, forgotten. We have kids being shot in their schools. They need better advocates than me, but in a room of twenty people I'm the only person asking hard questions. I'm new. They just want me to shut up and listen. But no one else is talking.   \n\n\nSo I get angry. Angry that no one else can step up and take some of the weight off my shoulders. Angry that no one else is advocating in high-level meetings for the people who need services the most. Tired from punching up through poverty, neglect, abuse, death (and several near-deaths), bullying in middle school, bullying in high school, college, and graduate school--only to be told I'm \"unprofessional\". I know I'm lacking in tact. I just...I don't know. I feel like every time I set an emotional boundary, like \"no, you believe in what you're talking about, don't give up\" I instantly doubt myself and become convinced I am the narcissist that I was always destined to be, the only kind of adult you could ever become after decades of narcissistic abuse.   \n\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Thanks to anyone who slogged through it. ",

I knew that he would go back on things he said and that he was the biggest hypocrite I ever met.\n\nI knew EVENTUALLY that his manipulations (gaslighting) might be incorrect when I was so forlorn that I found it NECESSARY to start recording arguments, so that when he would claim something never happened, that I could prove it wrong to just myself. I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.) I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story.\n\nI knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!) and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did! It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!\n\nI knew it all in my heart of hearts that it was all WRONG. With NO OTHER MAN have I ever sat up and looked at their sleeping face and wondered...have they ever murdered anyone? Have they ever raped anyone? Do I even know them, or could they be evil? It turns out when that's the truth...our heart already knows even though our mind may not. So many have asked why I didn't leave earlier? I have asked myself. Part of me didn't want to believe it. However, another part already knew it all, and knew it would go bad for me, maybe even deadly if I did. However, my soul was already dying. When I finally got out, and started reading some of the books, and started to understand words like Gaslighting, Flying Monkeys, Word Salad, Blame Shifting and Abuse Amnesia, not only did the last 3 years start to make sense, but my entire life (I have a Nmom) started to make sense.\n\nSo when this man is still stalking, harassing and OBSESSED with me a year later after he assaulted me and I left! When I am ENEMY NUMERO UNO, the ONE that destroyed his life the most in his mind, and people now ask me why I am still afraid, and they say that I am paranoid, I no longer get angry at these well wishing friends. I finally understand that they just don't get it, and that they weren't there. That there is no way they COULD understand something that I barely can grasp myself. However, I now also KNOW that I am not wrong to TRUST my intuition. To move residences when he found one or to take extra precautions is all just SMART.",

I’ve been no contact with Nmom for about 15 years, was briefly in contact with her while my enabler stepdad died young at 57, and I’ve been no contact with her for a year and half again now.\n\nI’m filling this emptiness up with shame and hypochondria thoughts of me having skin cancer or that the tinnitus I have means I have brain cancer. I can’t face the truth: I’m free. I can live as I want. I can be happy with my wife and kid, I can talk on these forums and not be be paranoid that my mom will find it because she isn’t this omniscient monster I made her out to be, she is a crack cocaine addict and her drug addled mind can’t even work a printer. \n\nI have paranoia that she will get sober enough to find me and harm me or my family, but I doubt she could even do this successfully. She is going crazy right now because my grandfather left my sister (37, former golden child but now no contact with mom, I also fear that she may be a narcissist) and I his house and land with a condition that mom is allowed to stay in the house until she dies, and afterwards we are free and clear to sell it and split everything. Neither one of us want to sell it with mom around or have anything to do with her. Mom is going up to the estate attorney and trying to figure out how to capitalize on her role as a leasee of land; she can’t. I laughed when I heard this; as I said this woman who was once this tormentor and goddess of pain and destruction is now powerless and grasping for money, money which apparently i have (but I can’t access).\n\nNmom has run some scams; she did “borrow” money from my grandpa saying it was for me. I didn’t find out about this until after he died. She also went to her in-laws and said that she needed $2000 for grandpa’s funeral, but my in-laws didn’t fall for it thankfully. \n\nShe must be burning through money; she is an RN and does manage to work somehow at a veterans home in Texas. She makes close to 80K a year, pays no rent. Just utilities maybe a car loan. The rest goes for crack and probably regular cocaine. \n\nI’ve tried to figure out how to report her for being an addict and nurse; I can’t. If anyone knows how to do this I’m welcome to the suggestion. Apparently you need to be more than just high at work in order to be written up.\n\nTLDR\n\nNmom is powerless, she is an addict and most people either see her as this or just a mean person. I think I’m so used to the drama that now I don’t know what to do with myself so I’m inventing diseases to be concerned with.\n\n",

He was good in some ways but also raised me to have zero self\\-esteem and to be horribly depressed because of his hidden bullying, and he just got worse as I aged and got more independent. \n\nHere is the thing though, I like my nice elderly uncle. He has a good relationship with my dad. I seldom see him, but we write emails and talk on the phone sometimes. Now my uncle has mailed me and told me that he doesn't understand what is going on with me and my dad and can't I just get in touch with him a little? \n\nI don't know what to say because obviously we have different views of the same person (because we have been treated differently) and I also wonder what to say to other relatives when they ask. I don't want to lose contact with everyone just because I am trying to improve my mental health by not seeing one person. \n\nI also worry if I'd indeed get in touch with my father just a little through text or something then he'd take that finger and get the whole arm? As in trying to get into my life more and control me again. I feel sick just thinking about interacting with him again to be honest. But he acts very nice in public. ",

Coincidentally, those two people came from the same state, but I'm semi-positive that they're not the same person.\n\nFurther communications with the female elder weren't horrible or great.  If she was manipulating, I must have given her a tough time even without my believing that she was trying to manipulate me.  I keep an open mind, but once I set a fact it's hard to make me doubt it.\n\nI privately told her husband that I wanted her to get help before she hurt others like she hurt me, he waved it around like I was insulting her.\n\nI don't know what the husband does IRL, I could probably figure it out from his Facebook.  The wife is a receptionist for a non-essential pampering business.",

        "text": "I've been having some problems recently that are giving me some issues with relationships. I can't figure out if it's because of how I grew up or if I'm just messed up in general. I've had people tell me I'm too accepting of things. The fact that I don't really open up to people because I learned not to open up to anyone. No one needs to know about my problems, but when I'm getting to know someone, they don't want to know that crap. Maybe I miss some signs but I just keep quiet no matter what and it's driven people away. But if I talk about what bothers me, I just come off as needy when I really am completely independent. Sure. I want to be around whoever I'm dating, but I also want my alone time, it's just I get too much of it. \n\nI've also been told I won't argue about anything and it's not a good thing. Arguing scares me. I feel like there's no point voicing how I feel because it doesn't matter/someone will just shoot me down instantly. I want to talk and I try to, I just freeze and I can't explain why. \n\nI feel awful because I want help, I'd love to have someone to lean on, but I feel like I just annoy people. I ask for help. Try to open up and I just feel worse then when I started. I tend to just clam up when things happen and freak out on my own when bad stuff happens because there's no one to really turn to. No one wants to be around someone who is upset over something and I feel stupid for asking to be around someone. I know it's selfish but sometimes I really need someone.\n\nIn what ways are you supposed to open up to people? I know I shouldn't talk about my problems, but how do you even voice an opinion when you don't really have one? Or if something someone says is bad, but you don't want to sound weak or get into an argument because you don't even know if it's a valid reason to feel upset. Or if someone does something you don't like. How do you deal with that?\n\nI know that some people feel like if you don't open up or argue it means you don't really care about them, but that just isn't the case. \n\nTldr.",

Last thing I left open was email, as the only thing he was responsible for after the divorce (I let him walk away with everything to get it done ASAP) was to refinance our home so the mortgage isn't on my credit report anymore. \n\nEmails keep pouring even today, almost one year since I left and 6mo after divorce has been finalized, first saying he needs another chance, that he's a totally different person (yea sure), followed by angry emails, followed by nude requests, followed by something mundane like \"how was your day today?\" and back to angry emails. Everything was my fault. The cursing, the insults, the sexual abuse, the putting down, he has an explanation for everything and I supposedly crazily one day just left the house. \n\nHe mentioned the closing of the refinance a few weeks ago so I let him know I was also cutting email to completely move on and left him my office # to arrange when to sign the quit claim deed papers so the deed is just in his name. Today I got 4 calls already trying to convince me to see him and go to his place to sign the papers, saying I didn't try, that I'm the reason our marriage failed, that I'm so mean to him and I'm such a bitch for wanting to meet at a Starbucks.\n\nI can't I just can't deal with the mental torture anymore, it's surreal. I talk to my friends to let steam out but I know they can't be there for moments like these when Ima have to see him to sign this stuff and I'm totally helpless having to suck up how he blames me for everything and tells me I used him because I know answering back is pointless anyway, and I have very little confrontational skills anyway.\n\nThings like these make me wanna hurt myself again. Is there an escape from this without moving away?? Honestly how can I just let this not go deep through my skin? Please help!!!!!",

        "text": "My mom is a vulnerable narcissist and until my mid twenties (about 5 years ago) we had a deeply enmeshed relationship that was essentially emotional incest. She was abusive and cruel, but because I was the \"family savior\" and we were so deeply enmeshed, distancing myself has been incredibly painful. \n\nAbout a year ago I finally told my mother that her presence in my life was harmful to me. I told her that every phone call, text and email from her caused me distress so severe that I was in therapy specifically to deal with it. I didn't specifically use the words \"low contact\" or outline what I wanted our relationship to look like going forward, but I made it clear that I wanted less of her in my life. \n\nRight after that I had a birthday. She sent me a horrible, manipulative email saying that her gift to me was that she wouldn't call me on my birthday, since I clearly didn't want to hear from her. \n\nEvery holiday and special event since then has gone a little bit better than the last. They all still cause distress and anxiety, but I feel like I am making progress in enforcing boundaries and she is getting better at accepting and respecting them. \n\nIn the last six months, she has stopped texting me in between holidays. There are no more \"I'm just thinking of you\" texts and no more \"I just wanted to hear your voice\" phone calls. She's finally gotten the message that I won't respond to those intrusions into my life. The last time we spoke was on Mother's day and the last time we spoke before that was a brief conversation about a relative who was ill. \n\nIt seems like things are finally the version of \"low contact\" that I have been wanting. So I should be happy. This is what I wanted. \n\nBut I'm not happy. I have these nagging worries about what she thinks of me, how I'm a terrible daughter, how she must be angry at me, how the fact that she doesn't call me anymore means she's mad at me (even though it's literally what I asked for!). \n\nI think that the main problem is that my mom's primary form of discipline when I was a child was to withhold love and affection when I didn't live up to her standards. I was often smothered by her attention, but there were times when she hated me, and when she hated me I became invisible. So now even though I asked for this low contact arrangement, I can't seem to stop myself from interpreting it as rejection. \n\nPart of me just wants to pick up the phone and tell her that I'm sorry for being such an awful daughter, just to make that feeling of rejection go away.
