        "text": "We've all read the flurry of AI related posts as of late. Some informative, some fearful, and some a stretch. While I can't/won't speak to the volume, I do feel the need to point out the obvious, if as nothing more than a reminder:\nAI isn't the \"problem\", people are. It's about how people in positions of power will abuse the technology for their own ends or greed. It's about how humankind has a knack for taking things with positive potential and manipulating them into something positive for a select few, or outright \"evil\".\nI realize many of you who read this are thinking, \"no shit, genius\". My aim here isn't to bring a sparkling new idea to the table, but to remind us all that not only do there need to rules in place to govern the use of such tech, but that we, the people, are the ones that need to call for such things. \nIf the tech and it's story are left unchecked, if left to those uninformed or with less than altruistic goals, then we are doomed. Doomed to be further behind the curve, deeper under the boot, lagging behind even before we've begun.\nProgress is an engine that cannot be stopped, but it can be \"controlled\". Just look at how the religious in the US have kept stem cell treatments at bay. We all \"have skin in this game\". Unless you're fortunate enough to not have to work for a living and live on an island governed by international law.\nFear gets us nowhere. Action, even as little as using our voices in the right places, gets results. I say all this in hopes that we all quell our fears and debates, and invest that passion into making a difference.\n(Yes, I realize this is lacking in details or a \"call to action\". I believe in starting the conversation and letting those smarter/more informed than I help set the tone)",
