        "text": "Disclaimer: I posted this in a university subreddit and got very little response before it was buried. I'd really like to have a discussion about this because as I understand it, many Atheists are somewhat forced into attending religious universities because the programs are the best in the area, or the benefits (like mine below) aren't found in public schools.\n\nThis year, I began a Masters program in Counseling at a Christian university. I am (have always been) an Atheist, but I attend this school for several reasons:\n\n* I'm in my 30's and finished my undergraduate program 4 years ago without honors or an internship. I've since been a stay-at-home-mom, so I have no resume. I was afraid when applying to schools that I would be rejected, so I only considered those I thought I would surely get into with the two rec letters I was able to get.\n\n* I have a child, but no childcare other than my husband when he's home in the evening, and this program's courses are set up for working adults (evening classes, one class per week, etc).\n\n* I get a discount on tuition because of a special program they offer which other universities in my area do not (but some other schools are cheaper anyway).\n\n* The campus is about 3 blocks from my house.\n\n* I was assured by the program director (with whom I openly discussed my Atheism) that religion factored very little into the coursework, and was more of a general \"attitude\" of the school rather than a required area of discussion and study. She also assured me that they strive to admit diverse students, and many have different religious backgrounds.\n\n* This counseling program is highly regarded and well-respected, with a very high NCE pass rate and post-graduation employment rate.\n\nI'm starting to feel like I was \"sold\" this school for my money. I've become disenchanted and distressed about how much religion is proving to matter in the coursework, and I am starting to think the \"perks\" may not be as important as I thought.\n\nIn both (non-religious) courses I've taken so far, religious reflection has been a required part of the work. We are required to write about our spirituality, our beliefs, etc within the framework they provide, which has so far been Christian text. If it were just reflecting on my lack of spirituality, that would be one thing, but this school wants me to talk about my spirituality within the context of the Christian readings, and frankly I just don't know how to do that without coming across as argumentative or disagreeable.\n\nRecently, a professor told our (counseling theories) class that she believes that all mental illness in the world comes from Satan, and that the only way to \"fix it\" is to walk \"God's path.\" Many of our assignments in this course are centered on honest, genuine self-disclosure and examination in order to help us to know ourselves at a deeper level before we see clients - and they all require us to write about spirituality. I feel very uncomfortable being open with someone who holds such dogmatic beliefs and feels at liberty to share them in such a harsh manner with the class.\n\nFinally, it is becoming clear that the other students also prefer to discuss religion rather than the course material. In required online forum discussions, 50%+ of the discussion is based solely on the religious readings, and they talk amongst themselves about God and their beliefs. I feel very left out here - not only are we missing out on a lot of meaningful discussion about the real material, but I can't really participate in most of their discussions either. I'm starting to really feel like an outcast.\n\nI'm seriously considering transferring. Two other schools in my area offer great programs, but so far I'm not sure if they will have an option for evening study. They require a third rec letter and a resume, of which I have neither. I suppose I could go to my last professor for a letter, but that would be pretty odd (\"hey, I don't like your school, help me get into another one\"). Also, let's be honest, applying/registering/orienting to graduate school is a huge pain and I'm just not sure it would be worth all of the work and stress on top of the workload I have now.\n\nAre there any other Atheists here who have attended Christian schools who could tell me if this level of religious course involvement is to be expected? What would you do? Talk to the department director, just go ahead and start working on a transfer, or suck it up and grit your teeth through it?\n\n\ntl;dr : I don't like my school, it's more religious than they said it would be and I feel like a round peg in a square hole. I'm looking into transferring, but for now, I'd really just like to talk about this. Are other religious schools THIS religious?",

        "text": "I just got out of school almost an hour ago. Towards the end of class I was debating a Christian girl and a Buddhist girl who was an ex-Catholic. Now I really can't clnvey the whole conversation because it was like alot of discussions where the Christians use alot of confusing wordplay but two main points are this:\n\n\n\n-The Christian girl on evolution. Firstly she asked if I \"believed\" in evolution.  I told her no, it's not something you \"believed\" in. She then made a typical strawman point regarding something Darwin didn't write and of course that misconception that one animal comes from another (I.e. monkey to ardvark to human).  Honestly I didn't know how to respond but I knew it was bullshit.\n\n\n-As for the Buddhist girl, she represents a problem9blem with many Buddhists. Many Buddhists have a very liberal view of religion, the idea that they are all equally good and or bad and all that shit, which clearly isn't the case. As a Zen practicioner, I admit Buddhism does have problems and some unreasonable concepts,  but likewise some people are Democrats or Republicans even if they don't agree with all of their parties policies.\n\n\nIt is very clear that some religions are better (or at least not as bad as others).  At this point in the conversation I criticized Original Sin claiming God set up Adam and Eve to fail by placing the Tree of Knowledge in Eden, and punishing them for eating it even if they didn't know right from wrong BEFORE eating the fruit, and I criticized the whole Flood story, citing the lack of scientific evidence and the fact that it would have been immoral for God to kill EVERYONE on Earth, inclunding children or babies (and the animals for that matter). They said something along the lines of it being a choice like it is with going to Heaven versus going to Hell. I then said what kind of choice is that if the only alternative is eternal torment, and they said I was associating right and wrong with obedience and disobedience.  Like I said, confusing wordplay as well as the whole Christians go by the New Testament,  despite me reading the verse of Jesus that contaradicts this.\n\n\n\nOh and I shit you not, the Christian girl actually says that I couldn't say the Bible was immoral because it's moral teachings were revolutionary and were the basis for Western civilations morals. I asked what about morals before that, and she says that we had them but they weren't really systemized or written down (wtaf). I regret not putting up a better fight, but it's safe to say that with the Bible being so convuluted with contradictions and such, that's what makes it so hard.\n\n\nThoughts? ",

The following day I got multiple lectures on home I will  need Jesus when things get bad and how I can't watch horror movies because they are Satanic and my mom even considered getting holy water to repel the demonic influence she says possesses the house.\n\n\nNow, she is forcing me to go to church and my father called, and oh boy he wasn't pleased either. I told him I didn't want to be indoctrinated anymore, because I learned about science, and brought up how in the US there is freedom of religion.  Now my father grew up in the Civil Rights era with the Black Panthers, racist police etc in Oakland, so he has always carried a bit of prejudice with him. I mention this because in response he said that only him, my mom and God care about me and that the USA ain't shit. He then says the things in science are nothing but a bunch of white guys coming up with ideas. He then started guilt tripping me saying my mom is real sad over this and how I used to like church growing up, and that I read too much into this and am confused.\n\n\n\nHonestly,  I am feeling a bit guilty. On one hand, the amount of paranoia,  homophobia,  and dogma dripping off my parents is ridiculous.  As I mentioned before my dad called my sister's boyfriend a faggot and my mother said homosexual intercourse is the same as sleeping with an animal. On the other hand, I know that like with most people (especially blacks) religionmis their main source of meaning and purpose, so that's where the conflict comes from.\n\n\nAs a Buddhist, I know everything is impermanent and changes. My parents however can't accept this. They can't accept I'm not the same as I was before. I can't take back what's been said because I couldn't hide it forever as once in college I wouldn't be going to church and would instead seek meditation centers and Buddhist temples, as well as secular groups. I know it breaks their hearts, but life is too short to be something I'm not. And lying is a sin, yet they want me and my sister to continue acting Christian when that's not who we are anymore.   I have a long way to go now, and things just got harder...",

First of all, I know there are hundreds of posts like this one already being made but I still wish to know of someone is in a situation similar to mine and could give advice.\n\nI'm a 22M, only son of my single mother, never met my father until I was 15. Raised in the catholic faith but my mother family never has been that religious to begin with.\n\nWhen I met my father, he was sick with cancer and died roughly 1 year later, didn't affect me much since I never had a relationship with him to begin with, but thats another story.\n\nFast track 3 years after his death, my uncle who I really got along with (his brother), I dare say I see him as a father more than my actual father. He offered me to come live with him and work at his metal workshop now that my cousins already married and moved out of his house, he had spare rooms, I took the offer since due to a bad financiaI situation I couldnt finish college, so I wanted the job to finish it since I need to be a pillar for my mom to lean on when she retires and wanted the experience, no problems there. \n\nProblem started roughly 1 month after I arrived, you see, my uncle and aunt are evangelical pastors, with their own church and all that stuff, I always knew that and it was never a problem that I was an atheist and came to visit all the time. But now that I actually moved in with them, it's awful. My aunt is super religious, won't let me have a girlfriend, forces me to go to her shitty sunday service and preach, lasts 3 hours from 9:00 to 12:00. When I say I don't want to go she gives me the cold shoulder for the entire day, she even tells me \"You live in a house of the kingdom, so you must go to service, god told me your soul will burn in hell if you dont\". \n\nLike, it got to the point I make an effort to avoid them now, my uncle is pretty chill so if you don't show interest in his church he's cool with it and leaves you alone, but my aunt is another story, she's the one that has \"the pants\" sort of speak in the house. My uncle just agreed with everything she says.\n\nI work from Mon-Fri 7:00 to 17:00, go to school from 18:30 to 22:00, saturdays I go visit my mother, so basically sundays are my only free day, and I'm forced to go to listen to a preach for 3 hours watching people jumping around, screaming, convulsing all because \"the holy spirit\" entered their bodies, more like mass hysteria. I can't refuse since I fear I'm gonna get kicked out of the house. (Not payig rent is what helps me keeping studying)\n\nSorry, for the long post, needed to vent. So how do people in this subreddit deal with your religious parents/guardians when you are finantially dependent on them and moving out is not an option?\n\ntl;dr Finantially dependent on religious family members that force their beliefs onto you, seeking advice to deal with it without killing myself in the process.",

A lot of people will tell people these are great arguments to use against us atheist and some even try selling books and whatnot with these bad arguments. But why would you do this? They are easy to reflect and leaves the believer with nothing. It's like if someone is in a boxing match and you tell them the opponent's left arm is weak,but when they go for it the arm isn't weak at all. It's setting them up to fail. Why do this to your own side?",

        "text": "His answer to question, \"do you believe in God?\"\n\n Gleiser: I position myself as an agnostic. I don’t see evidence for any kind of supernatural being or intervention, but also understand that we are partially blind to what’s out there and hence should show some humility. I see atheism as being inconsistent with the scientific method, as it is, essentially, belief in nonbelief. It does not offer any proof of nonexistence as that would be literally impossible through science. Atheism elevates belief to a rational argument that is very ill-founded epistemologically. You may not believe in God, but to affirm its nonexistence with certainty is not scientifically consistent. If you are nonbeliever, the only position consistent with science is agnosticism. \n- Next, this os his answer to the question of whether we'll ever know why there's something rather than nothing-\n\nGleiser: I don’t think we can, at least not through science only. This reverts to the problem of the First Cause, which is the uncaused cause that gave rise to all other causes. We humans think along causal chains, and can’t figure out how something came about and started the game. Claims that quantum physics can do that, as in the “universe out of nothing,” miss the fundamental point that we must assume these theories to start with. The question then becomes why these laws and not others in this universe? And if we appeal to a multiverse to try to answer this, we tangle ourselves in even more knots, given that we can’t know whether a multiverse exists.\n\nso yeah, I agree that to believe unequivocally that something couldn't exist given the other things we can't explain, becomes in itself a kind of religion. \n",

Single mom raising me, and I had to grow up fast because she wasn't entirely well equipped for the job. Trauma and mental illness making it difficult. She's been single for years, and during the summer met this much younger guy - he's just a few years older than me - who charmed her. He's a paranoid schizophrenic, who keeps having bouts of deep religious fervor. Thinking he's chosen by god to die a martyr's death in Israel, for example. He also thinks he can control the weather, and communicate with animals. Real piece of work. During my mother's worst psychotic episodes, she's had similar thoughts, so she's susceptible to that kind of grandiose delusion.\n\nHe's convinced her that she's lived an unclean and bad life, and the only way to cleanse herself is by joining his pentecostal group/church thing, begging forgiveness, and amongst other things, donate essentially what little she has to charity.\n\nShe's always had a vague belief in god, but the past two weeks or so she's gone completely off the rails.\n\nWhen I lived back home I had a lot more contact with her and could help her navigate through her crazier moments. Talk things through and get her to see reason. Now he's there all the time, and I'm not. We talk on the phone daily, but that's about it. He gets to sit up until late at night, plying her with alcohol and filling her head with this... poison.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. She doesn't respond to reason right now. She seems as far gone as the worst zealots I've ever had discussions with.\n\n...and it's my mom.

Now, I know the real definition is the lack of belief in a god, but I am wondering if any of you have a simpler way of explaining this or if you have any useful analogies, as she did not seem to grasp this idea. \n\nInterestingly, she claimed that in order to say that there is no god, one has to believe that there is a god to not believe in. This is an irrelevant bit of information, but I thought you all might have fun with it (I used Santa as an example). \n\nThank you!",

The man did the talking for her at the immigration area (you have to go fill out an immigration paper on your way out of Mexico) and said she was his sister in law.

If you want to PM me, I'd love to talk more. I'd also appreciate some good atheist literature recs.**\n\nHi, friendly Catholic here with a question. Apologies for any mistakes/poor syntax, I'm on mobile. \n\nI've read a few people on this sub say they would believe in God if someone were to provide scientific evidence of God's existence. However, I don't believe any sort of scientific evidence could ever be sufficient. For example, if you were to pray that you grew a third arm and you immediately grew a third arm, I don't think that would be sufficient evidence for God, just evidence that \"something\" is out there. Likewise, if a message in the sky appeared to the world saying \"God exists and he wrote this,\" that could be explained by things other than God, such as a human construct, aliens, or the aforementioned \"something.\"\n\nI don't think it is actually possible to produce scientific evidence that would establish God's existence, authority, omnipotence, etc. What say you? \n\nEdit: I suppose my examples aren't strictly \"scientific,\" but I think I still got my point across. Also, if I misrepresented the position of some of you, please correct me. \n\n",

All those horrible things in those movies you shouldn't be looking at.  I used to, but God saved me by his grace and I no longer do such things!\"\n\nThis got me thinking, then the Holy Bible must surely be ok to read right?\n\nI recently watched IT (2017) rated R.  Pretty good movie, children get murdered and lots of blood.\n\n2 Kings 2:24 \"He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.\" (Bigger kill count than IT!)\n\nNumbers 31:17-18 \"Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.\"\n\nAlso this gem :\n\nDeuteronomy 28-30\n\n The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth. 26 Your carcasses will be food for all the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. 27 The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. 28 The Lord will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind. 29 At midday you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you.\n\n30 You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. 31 Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. 32 Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. 33 A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. 34 The sights you see will drive you mad. 35 The Lord will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.\n\nInteresting that the Lord willingly causes your wife to be raped as punishment.\n\nI don't think R rated movies really go that far most of the time.\n\nSo what makes me curious, is surely an educated man of god has read these things.  Did your own conscience never tug at you when you read these things?  The the God you worship is really no different than his own enemy Satan?  \n\nTruly, if God's cool with these things, Satan doesn't seem that worse.  Heaven and Hell can't be that much different then.  One is way too bright and the other is way too hot, but both are shitholes ran by assholes.",

        "text": "I'll start with mine:\n\n&gt;Religion isn't inherently bad. Al-Qaeda might be the first to come to mind when it comes to the bad of religion. It's not caused mainly by religion. There could exist (and does exist) a religion for peace; e.g. Buddhism.\n\n&gt;Religion is a bonding agent for mankind. The feeling of kinship joins people. While many critics point out The Crusade or the 30 Years War as a counterexample, this argument still stand because in those wars, the factions are cemented by religion. This argument supports pluralist religions even more.\n\n&gt; Faith helps us to go through our ignorance. The feel of emptiness that our reality gives is very dreadful. Faith can console us in hard situations like these. Our minds will never be able to understand this universe. Our consciousness is limited. We're not the gods.\n\nRefutations:\n\nReligions might be not morally bad. Using Buddhism as an example is valid. I saw a critic of Hitchens which stated that religions when not used as a justification of vice, **could** be a force of good. Put a stress on the word \"could\" for now.\n\nReligion is indeed a bonding force. **The question is whether religion is a good bonding force or not**. The Crusades undermines this. What religions do is inciting tribalism.\n\nStill at the second point. **Claiming religion as a bonding force doesn't make a case for religion itself. Political affiliation, ideology, or even a fanbase can achieve the same effect** - even better, without superstitions. The second point is more or less like saying that cheese stick is edible, therefore it's fine to be eaten everyday - Religion is a bonding force, therefore it should culminate.\n\nMy main issue is the irrationality. Faith is still a truth claim nonetheless. It should be evaluated. So far, there's yet to be any valid justification for satan, angels, etc. **It's not a wise thing to derive our knowledge and decisions on faith.** Let's put back the **could**. Religion relies on faith, on unjustified obedience. It **could** justify both vice and virtue.\n\nA quote that I'd like to put as a closing of this post:\n\n&gt;If a faithful account was rendered of Man’s ideas upon Divinity, he would be \r\nobliged to acknowledge, that for the most part the word ‘gods’ has been used to \r\nexpress the concealed, remote, unknown causes of the effects he witnessed; that he \r\napplies this term when the spring of the natural, the source of known causes, ceases \r\nto be visible: as soon as he loses the thread of these causes, or as soon as his mind \r\ncan no longer follow the chain, he solves the difficulty, terminates his research, by \r\nascribing it to his gods . . . When, therefore, he ascribes to his gods the production \r\nof some phenomenon . . . does he, in fact, do any thing more than substitute for the \r\ndarkness of his own mind, a sound to which he has been accustomed to listen with \r\nreverential awe? \n\n- Paul Heinrich Dietrich, Baron von Holbach, Système de la Nature, London, 1770 \r\n\n^(PS: Do you think this post would sound convincing if a superstitious/religious person read it? I'm trying to refine my persuasion technique)\n\nEdit:\n\nAnother strong point made by theists is that:\n\n&gt;irrationaly exists everywhere; elections, taxes, authority, etc. Therefore, religion is fine and is inherent to us.\n\nMy answer is that **being afraid of the cops is different from the gods**. The cops can beat you. You know what will probably happen to each decision you make; Inductive reasoning could help. In the case of a god, you don't. You don't even know their existence.\n\nEdit2: Replace Buddhism with some kind of humanist religion. My point is that it's possible to have a religion that is compatible with our morality and it still doesn't help the case for religion.",

The big reason? I have Complex Trauma Disorder with Psychotic Features, and before I was medicated, I could \"hear\" the Gods and see ghosts and spirits etc. Now that I'm medicated, none of that really happens anymore. If you ask me still-religious friends, they will tell you some kind of insane theory about how psych meds block your chakras and make the Gods unable to communicate with you, which is a convenient excuse if I've ever heard one. \n\nHowever, I also have OCD, and part of OCD, naturally, is something called \"Magical Thinking\". And unfortunately, since I've been so heavily steeped in religion for so long, I get anxious thoughts sometimes that \"God\" or \"Demons\" will punish me if I talk about them not existing, or if I talk/think about them at all. Of course, I know this is preposterous, because I am a logical person, and I tend to seek out logical explanations for things, but OCD is rarely logical. \n\nSo I guess, in a round about way, I'm trying to ask: When you first figured out you were an Atheist, was it scary to let certain beliefs go, and how did you do this, gradually? I understand this may not be the case for everyone, but anyone who was deeply religious before, as I was (I was studying to be a priestess) might understand how coming to this revelation might be scary; but I am so ready to be done of superstition and all that nonsense. Does the fear fade the more you look for those real life answers to problems? I've already given up prayer, I'm selling off all my altar items. How do you eventually shake off these bonds of superstitious belief and become truly free? \n\nTL;DR - How do you learn to lean on faith less and reason more, as a newly discovered Atheist? \n\n(PS: My therapist is of no help because he believes in the supernatural.) \n",

We know what Peter and James believed because we have records of what their students wrote.\n\n2. Peter and James fully endorsed Paul’s preaching and message.\n\n3. Peter, James, and Paul all believed in a bodily resurrection.\n\n4. We know that the author of Luke-Acts was a companion of Paul.\n\n5. The author of Luke-Acts is widely considered an accurate historian.\n\nI only received 4 top-level comments, so this is not an exhaustive study. \n\n1. We don’t really have sources about Peter and James aside from the Gospels and Paul’s Epistles. Even according to Paul there are differences in their beliefs and Paul’s preaching has differences from the Gospels.\n\n2. There are disagreements between Paul and Peter although our sources for these are only Paul and Acts. How deep these disagreements are unknown as are the areas where they agree. It is possible that Peter may have agreed with Paul’s mission although there messages were different.\n\n3. There was disagreement on this point among commenters. One said that the creed in 1 Corinthians 15 wouldn’t make sense if the resurrection wasn’t bodily, but I don’t see that conclusion necessary follows. One argues that Christophanies similar to Paul’s experience among some of the twelve make more sense. And one argues that there simply is not enough information to know what kind of resurrection they believed in. \n\n4. The commenters all agreed that the author of Luke-Acts is unknown. Dates of authorship range from 64- 2nd century although the most likely range is 80-90.\n\n5. The most favorable comments were that he tried to give an accurate account but had a theological agenda that colored his narrative. It was noted that events in Paul’s life (as written in the Epistles) were not included in Acts. The least favorable comments said that Luke-Acts was fiction. Either way, it does not seem like Luke-Acts can be taken at face value as an accurate historical account.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this and if any of you have anything to add, that would be great. \n\n",

        "text": "Morals being dont kill, lie, steal etc. I know where those come from.\n\nBut what about other traits like charity, humility, simplicity,modesty etc? Are those biological and societal as well?\n\nAs bad as the abrahamic religions are, all of them (well jews and muslims impose a fixed charity tax) really emphasize giving lots in charity and living humble modest lives. Where would an atheist get the idea of being humble and giving charity from? And not living a hedonistic life?\n\nIm hoping to find some good answers, but for now my only answer is that the world needs religion to teach us those things. Yes i know they are atheist charity drives but i mean the average tom dick and harry. I still dislike religion. Just because some parts are good does not make it true, its like saying ill eat a pile of shit because 30% is chocolate?\n\nI have thought that religion doesnt invent these traits but just picked them up from their surrondings. Can someone please confirm if charity etc were common before the abrahamic faiths as well?\n\nPls be nice in the comments.\n\nAlso In really scared somone will say the traits lkke modesty, humility, simplicity , charity etc are bad traits well they are not, they are really good traits, and if all atheists think those are not good traits then maybe its best we remain a minority.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/7v3sex/on_antitheism_and_criticizing_religion/",
        "text": "Hello r/trueatheism\n\nI wanted to open discussion on a subject I have been thinking about a lot recently.\n\nFirst, I want to lay out some context (as I have failed to do so before and, understandably, I was accused of ulterior motives.) So I wish to be as clear as possible from my point of view. I am an atheist, and I have been since I was 16. I also believe religion has historically caused more harm than good. However, I have been left uncertain of the idea of anti-theism in that whether we should consider being so critical of religion (what Christians would call being a militant atheist) as a good thing or not.\n\nOne famous quote I see many atheists borrow from Karl Marx is this:\n\n&gt;Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo. Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.\n\nThis can be interpreted in two ways. One way, which I see many atheists argue, is that criticism of religion is important because if we remove what makes people so comfortable with their oppression (religion) then people will be more willing to remove their oppression. Basically, religion acts as a tool of the strong which puts the oppressed in their place and makes them unwilling to retaliate. Some evidence of this could be how Jesus told Christian slaves to comply with their masters in order to be saved. Remove the flowers from the chains, and people will break from the chains.\n\nAnother way to interpret this is that religion is a tool of the weak to cope with real oppression. This interpretation I find a lot on r/socialism. One quote from Marx indicated this \"[Religion is] the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the soul of soulless conditions\".\n\nThere is also this quote from Vladimir Lenin:\n\n&gt;But under no circumstances ought we to fall into the error of posing the religious question in an abstract, idealistic fashion, as an “intellectual” question unconnected with the class struggle, as is not infrequently done by the radical-democrats from among the bourgeoisie. It would be stupid to think that, in a society based on the endless oppression and coarsening of the worker masses, religious prejudices could be dispelled by purely propaganda methods. It would be bourgeois narrow-mindedness to forget that the yoke of religion that weighs upon mankind is merely a product and reflection of the economic yoke within society. No number of pamphlets and no amount of preaching can enlighten the proletariat, if it is not enlightened by its own struggle against the dark forces of capitalism. Unity in this really revolutionary struggle of the oppressed class for the creation of a paradise on earth is more important to us than unity of proletarian opinion on paradise in heaven.\n\nThere is also this article I found: https://bennorton.com/what-would-marx-think-about-reactionary-new-atheists/\n\n(Yes I know this is an extremely biased article, but since its just an editorial, I will let it slide).\n\nFrom this interpretation, religion is simply a byproduct of real oppression. Religion helps people cope with this oppression. Therefore, reason and critique will get us nowhere. The only way to rid the world of religion is to create a world in which people do not need religion, which is to get rid of oppression (which according to Marxists would be capitalism, but for non-communists it would be any other form of hierarchical oppression).\n\nSo now I am left confused. Neither interpretation really seems incorrect. Oppression creates religion, but religion creates oppression. Economy creates religion, but religion creates economy. Fear creates religion, but religion creates fear.\n\nIt seems to be a never-ending cycle of the two. Maybe it is a misconception that we should focus on just one (either religion or socio-economics) in that they seem to go together hand-in-hand. Atheism does not inherently lead to lack of oppression (such as the case with many dictators) and lack of oppression does not lead to atheism. So it may seem like we should be focusing on both.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nTL;DR There are two ways to view religion: a tool of the weak or a tool of the strong. The former implies that criticizing religion is pointless and that we should rather focus on creating a world in which religion is not needed. The latter implies that criticizing religion is important because it removes an efficient tool of powerful people. Which is do you believe is correct?",
