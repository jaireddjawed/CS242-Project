I helped out in an RA / support role but had not much to do with the write up. They slapped my name on some papers, even making me first author on a few. The publication process took several years, so the publication dates are recent - years I’d be 18-22 (so an adult) for. Now one paper is retracted for fraud by the journal. I know this is karma and my fault for being so stupid as to let them add my name to something I was too uneducated and young to understand. I know I’m not sympathetic here, but I’d like some advice all the same if you can. I’m now an adult in a completely different industry but I’m afraid this will become a big problem and derail my career. Can these journals add a note to the paper that I’ve retracted myself as an author? Would that even help or just make this all look worse? Is there a way forward now?",

Grad students win top awards, go to conferences, our PI is \"supportive\" in achieving our goals. They are generally personable and smiley, and our group is pleasant to collaborate with. \n\nBut all of these \"good\" things are actually lab member driven, and my PI is nowhere to be found 95% of the time. They are *constantly* traveling for non-academic purposes. (When I say constant, I mean they are not physically near the lab/office for probably 9 months out of the year... and we are a wet lab). My PI will meet with us via Zoom weekly (though my entire PhD has been largely solo and completed without guidance). \n\nThe pressure they put on us is *insane.* Every single graduate student in the lab has broken down and sobbed this week. More than once. Our technicians have largely quit or are holding on by a thread. Postdocs have left *en masse* over the past few years. Our last two post-docs are threatening to quit. *I* threatened to quit. \n\nCurrently, my PI does not go to their own required meetings (we go instead), we do their paperwork, do their peer review, mentor their younger students (entirely), write *all* grants, set up collaborations and budgets, write and largely edit the papers, submit papers, go to conferences, fund our stipends or TA, manage the lab manager/technicians, the list goes on. They bring in $250k+ a year to work maybe 2-4 hours per week. \n\nI have worked 4 weeks straight without a day off while my PI has spent the last 3-4 months traveling for fun. (Has only been \"in\" for about a week during that time). I've worked 68 hours this week (and theres still 2 more days to go). I have come to my PI *repeatedly* for *years* asking for change in the most professional way I can. Very little requests have been met, nor are they sustained for long.\n\nI do not think I can go to anyone for help without retaliation... and, at this point, I just want to finish my PhD and get out as soon as possible. (But I also cannot stand to see my lab crew crumble and continue to be abused, and am not sure I can handle the last semesters myself without genuinely breaking). \n\nIs there anything I can do at all?",

I'm not trying to claim that getting a job is easy by any means, especially at an R1 institute, but for looking at jobs in my career path (Kinesiology) in the state I would like to eventually lived, I counted 15+ open positions for an associate professor (which many were smaller R2s, and obviously maybe not a school I would want to go to if the time were to come). Is it that they just keep the applications open for a long period of time so it seems like there are more openings then there really is, or potentially that Kinesiology as a field is really growing so many departments are growing, or maybe I am just completely off. Just some thoughts from an undergrad who hopefully plans on masters and a PHD in exercise physiology.",

This might be a long story, please bear with me (note that you can only help me if you are well versed in philosophy, history, literature and politics or any of these subjects)\n\n\nThe last few years have been tough for me. Hardship is both a curse and a blessing. And going through a lot, I realised what I truly wanted to do. I wanted 'to know'.\n\n\nI know nothing about the world I live in. Very soon, I'll get into a college with a degree which will bring a lot of money home. I'll work till the day I die for an exploitative capitalist and either disappear after death or my soul will live in either hell or heaven. \n\n\nLife is short. I don't want to work like a dog for a house, a car and some fleeting entertainment.\n\n\nNow, I know that what I want to know and what I want to think about lies in philosophy, literature and history (and a bit of theology and politics too I guess). I've read classics from childhood; last two years, I've read a few works of Tolstoy, Hemingway, Dickens, Austen and Wilde and some others. But I know that there's a lot of difference between my reading and an actual student or professor's reading. Because I don't know the history, the context behind it or the method of how to get the most out of a certain book. In the same way, I've tried reading the works of plato, but the arguments of Socrates start to become jumbled and I doubt if they actually have any real impact on me and if I'm really learning things and looking at them the right way. Lastly, the problem I had with reading history was that I don't remember what book I downloaded, but it bored the hell out of me. It was like an encyclopaedia, listing dates and giving a one live description of an event or date. But I don't think history should be or is read like that. Instead, I would've liked to read books focusing on one topic/era/event and really an exhaustive and in-depth analysis of any historical event or era.\n\n\nMaybe you will recommend me to enroll in a college/university and major in these subjects, but it's impossible for me (the reason will take another 10k words, so skip). \n\n\nThe only resources I have are books. I have access to many different types of books. And the second resource is the internet. So, I'm making use of my second resource, asking educated people to help me on my journey to learn in an educated way about history, philosophy and literature.\n\n\n Please recommend to me good books (no matter how difficult it is), how I should read and analyse them and how to become well versed in these subjects without enrolling in college/university. (And also, if you're a student or professor of any of these subjects, can you please share your book lists with me, I'm quite curious and want to have a look!)\n\n\nRight now, I'm drowning in confusion and hopelessness and maybe your help is the only thing that can save me. ",

No family members, no friends, and she doesn't want to see that in any of her students' theses.\n\nAs someone who has finished a dissertation (and acknowledged my own family within) and who has graduated a number of PhD students, this seems like odd advice.

Second, doesn't it seem like a lot of gall to tell a student who is/is not worthy of acknowledgement? \n\nTo be clear, this is not personal, and I am not worried one way or the other about being acknowledged in my wife's thesis.

I realize that the lab-specific subreddit might be more applicable for my problem (this is probably me being too paranoid, but please don’t tag that subreddit), but these people also likely frequent that subreddit; I think they’re less likely to be here.\n\nI also don’t want to give too much detail in case this thread is found. But I used to be a part of the lab that does mouse research, including survival surgeries. Under normal guidelines at this institution, animal surgeries are supposed to be done in the procedure rooms of the animal facility, and then the mice are supposed to stay in their usual rooms with a special cage tag so that they can be under vet supervision. I know that this lab does not have any exceptions to these rules (was not in their protocol). However, not only do they do these surgeries in their lab space, they also keep the mice in their lab afterwards as well. Because the endpoints after the survival surgeries was sometimes weeks later, this means that mice (in their cages) are kept in cabinets in the lab for weeks at a time so that other people don't see them, only being opened to change their food/water or to be finally sacrificed. Because these mice aren't on vet supervision, it's pretty common for some to die each time. I didn’t take any part in these experiments while I was there, but I saw it and heard about it. I feel so bad for these mice. I know that this is still a common practice in this lab. The lab members also know that this is not allowed so there's no excuse. Instead, the people who do these experiments just complain that they know better and that the animal care rules are just BS bureaucracy making things difficult for them. The other members of the lab don’t try to stop them because they either agree with them, have no power in the lab, and/or worry about the backlash they might get.\n\nMore info about this lab: besides shady mouse practices, it was also a very toxic environment from almost everyone there (which is why I’m not there anymore). This is also a fairly famous and very well-funded lab, so they’re protected by the university. I’ve heard rumors that more than once in the past, other former members had threatened to sue (either the university or the PI, not sure), and the university just paid them off to keep things quiet.\n\nNow this comes to my question: what should I do, if anything? I feel like I need to report them. I didn’t while I was there partly bc I didn’t realize it was an option at first, and once I did, I was worried they’d immediately know it was me and it’d mess with my career. A part of me is also still worried they’d figure out it was me who reported them, but hopefully not…the lab has a high turnover so there’s a lot of people who’ve left it. Our university says they have an anonymous whistleblower system for things like animal care violations, but is this actually anonymous? And even if they were reported, would anything actually happen? My guess is the lab would be inspected for hidden mice, but if they didn’t have any mice hidden at the time, then nothing would happen. And if they did find mice, maybe they’d just be like given a reprimand? Would that be it? I don’t know. I don't even work there anymore so maybe I should just ignore it...\n\nIf you were in my shoes, what would you do?",

        "text": "I am doing PhD in business in an island in Europe and I started it in September 2020. The program consists of 5 years, first 2 years taking coursework and since year 3 doing research. Now I am in year 3 but havent got publications yet. I am doing a project with the department and some projects with students from other PhD programs in other countries. My master degree is from UK with distinction and bachelor degree from my home asian country with excellence. I took GRE in 2020 314 with quant 164 and verbal 150. My IELTS is 7.5. I seek for your advice if you will accept me or you prefer a fresh graduate. Because I talked with some professors, men and women, about my situation and they just told me to forget it and I was so lucky to get a scholarship while doing PhD.\n\nThe reasons I want to quit the current PhD and want to apply to start PhD again are below.\n\n1. Many bad things happened to me even on the first day when I did COVID quarantine. Specifically, I encountered an international criminal who killed someone for 300e living in the same house with me and when I reported it to the PhD coordinators, I could not receive much help. Then I moved from one rent house to another rent house because of some annoying things like the landlord wanted to rape me ( I am a woman) and stole my money but blamed me steal his stuff. I reported to the department but they even told me not report to police because no one bothered to help me because I am a foreigner. When I walk to the uni, many times old local men approached me for sex and even touched and hugged me on the street. Recently, I have just known that this country can have strong earthquakes because it is close to Turkey. Since 2023, we have encountered earthquakes 4 times.\n\n2.  Gradually I discovered the department did not pay as they promised and payed always late, sometimes even delayed to pay for 4 months, but professors did not care and the accounting team ignored us even some other PhD students and I went there to complain. Discrimination towards international students from professors is common. One of my supervisors left the department but noone let international students know but the local students all knew that. \n\nIn 2020, immediately after I entered, I really wanted to escape from the country but at that time no flights to go back to my country and if it had, I needed to book in advance of 6-9 months and it was very expensive, out of my budget.. then in 2021, COVID was severe in my home country and also few flights back home, so I did not manage to go and in 2022, I wanted to pass the comprehensive exam so I decided to stay. I simply think if I stay in Europe it is cheaper to move from here to other countries than from my home country if I get an offer from other schools.",

Somewhere along the line I just lost that passion due to mindless tasks and mundane life events. I am currently pursuing an undergrad for a career in tech but realized I may have the opportunity to revive my deep passion for science and exploration if I could become a computer scientist. \n\nNow I have no Idea how to go about doing this. I'm 19 years old from India in my first semester of an online bachelor's in computer applications which is more of an IT degree with not as much math. It's a 3-year degree and it's online due to a few health issues and other circumstances at the moment. From what I hear the research scene in India isn't great so I'm considering moving to the US or Canada for a Master's. It's going to be a challenge finding Universities that accept such a profile and I want to publish some research to strengthen my application.\n\nDue to my current situation and location, I have no means to socialize or join any clubs. There are no colleges where I live. Everyone I knew from school have moved elsewhere, so all I have is myself and my laptop. I've been into tech since I was a kid, learnt some hacking as an edgy teenager and made a few simple games but other than that I know almost nothing about this subject. I don't know what to learn to be able to develop curiosity and do research. \n\nIs research a good path? What steps do I take and what do I learn? Are there any organizations or websites to publish research? Is it difficult to get into? I'm not as concerned with money, but does it provide the same financial stability as the industry?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this doesn't belong here. I'd appreciate any responses.",

I have a lot of research experience, but it is all tangentially related to the specific area that I want to pursue. I am working on securing more relevant research opportunities this summer, but it is possible that I may just get roped into more experimental work if I can’t find any opportunities outside of my school, so I’m worried that I am being forced to specialize in an area that I’m not all that interested in pursuing. \n\nHow big of a deal is this for graduate admissions? If I want to go into theoretical physics, will graduate schools care that a lot of my prior research is in labs doing experimental condensed matter physics?",

During the complaint procedure, the university CC'ed the Director of Graduate Studies into the university's emails and PDF's to me. But the complaint's subject matter didn't relate to her. University confirmed that Director was not a decision maker. \n\nMy faculty just assigned this Director as one of my supervisors. But I worry that she is biased against me, and shall refuse to write me glowing references, simply as she knows about my previous complaint. Thin skilled academics dislike whiners and gadflys! I read some post here that mere spat with a professor, without any complaints, can spoil a student's relationship enough that the professor refused to write references! **Can anyone link to this post?**\n\nMy faculty requires written substantial reasons on the form to change supervisors. But I don't want to apprise, or remind, my department of my complaint! And alleging bias can come back to bite me! My faculty can reply that as mere fair-minded and informed observers to my complaint, these reasons of mine fail to constitute any real possibility of bias. Then I shall be stuck with Director, who shall loathe me more for calling her biased! \n\n## How can I request another supervisor more tactfully — without referring to my previous complaint, or accusing Director of Graduate Studies of anything like bias or conflict of interest? \n\n### https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/193290",

Essentially, I would drop out of the master's program, and continue as though I was doing my PhD all along. This would add another year to my degree, so I would finish in 2025.\n\nI also work full-time as an engineer, and my employer is very supportive and flexible about me doing my master's. Not sure how they'd feel about another year of schooling though (they aren't paying for it, so that's not a concern), but for argument's sake let's say my employer would continue to be supportive.\n\nI plan to go to law school in 2025 as well. I am to work in environmental law, so this PhD would be extremely beneficial. However, this would mean that nothing could go wrong in my PhD. I wouldn't want to defer law school to finish up the PhD, so I essentially have only 2.5 more years to finish it. It would be nice to have a year off between grad school and law school, but finding myself in a situation where I could essentially take a truncated PhD is making me consider the PhD.\n\nAs a note: the master's and PhD are fully funded, so I'm not taking out student loans.\n\nI am 26 years old.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, Reddit?

I am now in the process of applying to PhD programs in the same field. However, my advisor has been causing me a lot of stress and frustration throughout the entire process.\n\nFirst of all, despite countless reminders, my advisor submitted all of my letters of recommendation a full month past the application deadline, only after I had someone in the department intervene on my behalf (since he continuously said he would submit them and then wouldn't). This bothered me the most since it was actively harming my chances of being admitted to any PhD program.\n\nThroughout my entire thesis he would provide little to no guidance on what our objective was or if what I was doing was in the right direction. He would show up to our weekly meetings late, not say much or act disinterested, and then close the session.\n\nOnce we finally got to the writing portion, he provided zero guidance or resources on how to format my thesis to be in line with our university's standard (which I ended up finding out after reaching out to another faculty member I am close with for advice). Whenever I would ask for advice writing or structuring my thesis he would ghost me and then he randomly scheduled my defense for mid-January where I thankfully was able to successfully defend my thesis.\n\nI made the revisions suggested by the committee and then sent them to my advisor where he said he would look over them and handle the rest. However, according to my university's administration, my thesis was never received. So I reached out to someone else in the department to confirm this and they gave my advisor a reminder about my thesis needing to be submitted to a portal. Now he read through my thesis, gave half effort feedback, and told me to email it to the committee with changes by tonight.\n\nAfter speaking with some friends who also did their thesis they all said that their advisors provided much more support than my own and that my frustrating experience was not normal. I did not speak out earlier out of fear there would be negative repercussions (my advisor submitting a bad letter of recommendation or not scheduling a date to defend my thesis).\n\nFor reference, he is not tenured and is a relatively young professor. I feel as if this behavior is completely unbecoming of a university professor and that I should speak to someone now about my negative experience. English is not my first language, so sorry if there are some errors in my writing. I would appreciate any advice or similar experience.",

I generally have a good relationship with my supervisor and several mentors, but no committee officially formed yet. \n\nFor context, some of the things running through my mind about why I might quit: My supervisor is supportive with connections and resources, but is very, very hands off with my actual data and projects so I feel like I'm floating a bit out in the wilderness right now, by myself without a lot of direction. I feel like right now I just want someone to hold my hand and guide me, and if that means I'm not cut out for academia in this regard, that is fine. Additionally, and this is by far the biggest issue, I'm tired of being broke. I'm realistically looking at another 3 years left in my degree at essentially the same stipend. I came to the program from a professional job so I was used to the salary, have a mortgage and vehicle, and am a bit older (and have acquired some mental/physical health issues over the years) so I feel like sacrificing to live as I did when I was 24 isn't exactly the move I want to make. I would in all likelihood be able to leave with an MSc within the next 3-6 months.\n\n I've had some general discussions with my supervisor where I've expressed some issues where I've felt behind, been dealing with some mental/physical health issues, etc, but I haven't expressed to him a desire to leave the program, and I feel like he has been very patient and generous, so I don't know how it would be received. I wouldn't want to burn that bridge as he (and my mentors) would be absolutely fantastic references going forward. My supervisor and mentors do communicate when seeing each other on similar panels/etc. around campus. \n\nSo my main questions here are: I would like to discuss this potential career change with the mentors (several of whom may end up on my committee) I've built over the years, is that a wise move? Are there good ways to approach this that preserves the relationships? Should I be worried about discussing with my mentors, but not my supervisor, then supervisor finding out?\n\nTIA",

We did systematic study which PI didn't submit because he had already done one before me and submitted a paper with the other lab assistant.\nWhen i asked if you could include my name in the study because i have been working for 7 months on new Systematic mapping study, he refused as the study was submitted before my appointment. \n\nAfter that he told me to find a topic myself. \n\nI joined this lab because i was ensured that i will get paid and the topic is already there waiting to be worked on. \nPI told me to leave all other jobs that i had and focus on my phd topic.

When i was done he asked me if i knew why we were integrating these tools and i told him because you told me to. He laughed and left the matter. After 2 months he told me to find some paper that we can replicate i did code the experiment. Now he says we will find \"something\" in these paper to make a new paper. Which 2 months has past and he still cannot exactly explain what am i suppose to find? \n\nI still can't find a topic to work on. The PI is always busy with something.

Somehow they would know grades that people hadn’t even said aloud so it wasn’t from overhearing and our grades are given to us online. \n\nTo access grades, they just need our Student ID + the generic passwords. Most people didn’t change from the generic passwords so it’s possible to plug in random #s + a generic password to get someone’s ID # + grades.\n\nMy buddy had spoken to the 5 and it came up that they knew IDs of other classmates but wouldn’t say who (aside from one specific person) or how many IDs they had. \n\nAt the moment, only evidence we have is them admitting to my buddy that they have student ID #s, know which individuals the #s are associated, and know people’s grades. So no physical evidence that we know of.\n\nIs this worth reporting and are there any steps admin can do?",

I feel like it's harder than you'd think. You don't want to say, \"What's your research?\" because you can quickly find out yourself by reading through their lab website and past publications. Still, there have got to be great questions to ask to read the enthusiasm of the PI and to find out about ongoing/current projects. Suggestions?",

I also wanted to see if the percieved culpability differed if the offence was related to the defendents ACE - so for example, if someone had committed a physical assault, would they be given different sentence if they were physically abused as a child compared to being emotionally abused as a child.\n\nI thought about writing vignettes with the different ACES and then getting participants to give sentencing suggestions based on these, but I thought I would then have to randomise the gender of the defentent to account for gender biases. Also, in order to answer the second part of the question, I would then have to write 10 vignettes with congruous offences/ACEs, and 10 vignettes with incongruous offences/ ACEs, and that sounds quite messy. \n\nWould anyone be able to give a bit of guidance about the best way to answer this question, as I feel like I'm making this way more complicated than it needs to be. I hope all this makes sense lol. Thanks in advance😊",
