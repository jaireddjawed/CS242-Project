He mentions here having \"visions\" and that making MG was a religious experience for him.\n\n-Tippets story of taking too much LSD after working on ROTJ. He went on an epic trip to the center of the universe with his cat as a guide.\n\n-Del Toro ruminating on the possibility of making At the Mountains of Madness stop-motion, remarking how it would fit the scale of the story. Based on how well his Pinocchio turned out, I'd be delighted to see this.",

Tár being frequently barefooted in her apartment (I don't feel like that's a common thing especially if it isn't summer, also she is so persnickety about her clothing)\n3. Petra calling Lydia to hold her foot to soothe her back to sleep\n4. That shot of Tar when she got out of bed and her foot was prominently in front of the camera on the bottom left of the screen (that might have been unintended though)\n\nAny theories on this?",

        "text": "I recently rewatched The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2, and I must say these are very fantastic films.\n\nIn The Godfather, It is really an ensemble, but Marlon Brando takes the cake with a legendary performance are Don Vito Corleone. His Performance has all the legendary scenes and all very Quotable. Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Richard S. Castellano all Fantastic, even the Supporting Parts are all excellent. I feel that The Godfather is probably the only film that anyone could be nominated for an Oscar cause they are all Fantastic.\n\nIn The Godfather Part II, It is just as great as the Original. It really parallels the rise and fall of the Corleone family, how Vito Rise parallels Michael Fall from Face. Al Pacino probably gives his greatest performance in this film and really should of won the Oscar instead of Art Carney. One thing that really amaze me was the great performances of Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, but I find It interesting that after this film, they really didn't do anything noteworthy after, Especially Michael V. Gazzo. (Though Lee Strasberg was a very influential Acting Teacher before he did The Godfather). Again, anyone could of been nominated for The Godfather, Part 2 (Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone were snubbed).\n\nCoppola does a masterful job with these 2 films. He essentially made Shakespeare in a 30s gangster setting: a mixture of King Lear, Macbeth and a bit of Hamlet. The story of a good man being reduced to bloodshed.\n\nWhat do you think of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II?",

Essentially, alien is one of my favorite films, and I always thought it eons ahead of Hollywood ethos that Ridley Scott or someone in production took the character of Ripley and cast sigourney Weaver instead of the male that was written in the script. I know it's happened other times prior to this bizarre conservative culture war against equality. I know now a lot of people complain about diverse stories and interesting casting decisions as woke, which I really just don't even understand. That part of all of this is just disappointing to me. I think it's badass when they get creative or innovative in the creation of complexity and nuance are better narrative subtext and metaphor for what the story is about. Of course I never want someone to alter or ruin a story.\n\nBut I was just curious because I thought it was awesome and it probably changed things in Hollywood a little bit, and move the needle to see sigourney Weaver completely own that role that was simply scripted differently.\n\nSo what other times has this happened? And sorry about my voice to text auto capitalization. It's bizarre.",

        "text": "As one of the most iconic and influential filmmakers of the past few decades, Quentin Tarantino has left an indelible mark on cinema. Known for his unique storytelling style, masterful use of music, and penchant for violence, his films have become cult classics and critical darlings alike. But as Tarantino's career is coming to an end, I’m left wondering, who will be the “next” Tarantino. \n\nThere are certainly no shortage of talented directors out there, each with their own distinct style and approach. Some might point to directors like Edgar Wright, who has gained a following for his fast-paced, visually stunning films like \"Baby Driver\" and \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.\" Others might look to Jordan Peele, whose horror-thriller films \"Get Out\" and \"Us\" have earned him critical acclaim and a devoted fan base.\n\nAnother potential candidate for the title of \"next Tarantino\" is Ari Aster, whose films \"Hereditary\" and \"Midsommar\" have been lauded for their originality, emotional depth, and visceral scares. Like Tarantino, Aster is known for his ability to blend genres and create films that defy easy categorization.\n\nI also think another worthy candidate is James Gunn for his storytelling, violence and fantastic use of music. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while these directors may share some similarities with Tarantino, they are also very much their own artists. They each bring their own unique voice and vision to their films, and it's impossible to say for sure whether any of them will become the \"next\" Tarantino.\n\nUltimately, the question of who will be the next great filmmaker is a difficult one to answer. There are countless talented directors out there, each with their own potential to create groundbreaking films that will captivate audiences and change the course of cinema. Only time will tell who will be the next Tarantino, and whether they will be able to leave a similarly lasting impact on the movie world.",

Often they overdo it, with blinking eyes and obvious yawns.  But sometimes they get it right, at least in my opinion.  Alex Guinness in Smiley’s\nPeople, for example, when he wakes up to receive the call that his nemesis Karla has been caught in his trap.  Does anyone else out there pay attention to those waking-up scenes?  (It’s interesting to me because how do you perform unconsciousness into being present?)  Any actors, or scenes, come to mind that you’ve noticed?",
