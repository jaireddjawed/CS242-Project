The point is, for a small part of my framework I'm employing Freud's distinction between mourning and melancholy (in his \"Mourning and Melancholia\"). I know I have seen it elsewhere, and my professor actually suggested that this is the case, but I'm looking for some solid grounding that would allow me to say that melancholy is typically associated with the feminine ego. \n\nAny thoughts on that? Places to go, quotes to consider, things to read? \n\nAny and all help is very much appreciated. \n\nThanks, \n\n-Rizzpooch",

        "text": "I understand that the ending in this book is \"up in the air\" [pun intended] so to speak but I wanted to know if a particular event held any significance or foreboded the outcome of the novel's ending. Specifically when Milkman and the men of Shalimar were eviscerating the cougar.\n\nHere's why I wonder:\n\n* As the men of Shalimar are eviscerating the bobcat, important snippets of conversation between Guitar and Milkman follow specific events of the gutting. \n* There is a tenuous connection to be made between Guitar's cat eyes and the great feline, especially as Milkman looks upon the cat and notices \"the eyes held the menace of the night.\" The same night the cat was caught was the same night Guitar attempted murdering Milkman. \n* The final line of dialogue between Milkman and the men of Shalimar is absent a specific quote from Guitar but evokes an event when Milkman and Guitar noticed the white peacock:\n\n&gt; \"What are you going to do with it?\" asked Milkman.\n&gt; \"Eat him!\"\n&gt; A peacock soared away and lit on the hood of a blue Buick\n\nI understand why this image was evoked; Guitar said the exact same thing when Milkman asked \"What we gonna do if we catch him?\" \n\nHowever, the peacock is a symbol of aspiration both for Milkman and Guitar because they both chase it once they notice it. Guitar notices that it can't fly because \"All that jewelry weighs it down.\" But it's why Guitar makes that reference that's important. Guitar references valuable worldly goods [jewelry] as his mind lingers on another [gold](the object he pursues Milkman for in the end of the novel) to achieve his task as a Day and help out his family. Milkman's is also ambitious for the idea of gold but to escape his family and languid lifestyle. Milkman empathizes with the flightless bird because he also aspires to 'fly' but couldn't. What Guitar says earlier about flight to Milkman about the peacock is important not just then but for the ending as well:\n\n&gt; \"Wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.\"\n\nAnd Milkman does give up what weighs him down toward the end, specifically the final line.\n\n&gt; \"If you surrender to the air, you could *ride* it.\"\n\n\nwhich is another reason I think all of these events somewhat forebode the ending.\n\nI'd appreciate if someone would comment if my connections are legitimate? Is there any literary analysis to support it?\n",

I told her her best shot is to find the original source or at the very least the second source.\n\nSo, my question, *how* does she do it? Another of the tutors told her that she'll basically structure the quotations by using \" then ' then \" again, like this [horrible off-the-top-of-my-head example]:\n\nde Man says, \"Deconstruction is a thing, shown by Derrida, who says, '[i]t is a theoretical reaction against structuralist ideas, which, according to de Saussure, \"Is a new way of looking at linguistics\" ' \"\n\nThat's all fine and dandy. The biggest confusion is how she'll do the introduction of the quote and the in-text citation before and after the quote within a quote within a quote. I know that when you quote a source that quotes somebody else, you put the second author as your introduction and (qtd. in [first author]) as the in-text citation.

I've come a way in my thesis and support for the claim.\n\nWe have two source requirements: eight secondary sources and two theoretical texts. I am doing well on the secondary sources (I have six so far that all cover fatalism), but I am having problems with the requirement of theoretical texts. I read part one of Derrida's *Of Grammatology* (translated by Spivak) and have a good grasp of deconstruction as a concept (confirmed by my professor quizzing me over various aspects of it). However, I'm not sure how I am supposed to apply quotes from *Of Grammatology* to my research paper about fatalism.\n\nAlso, earlier in the development of my research paper, I was originally going to do it over trauma. My prof recommended theoretical texts for trauma studies (which he said is a psychoanalytic/deconstruction hybrid). Is there possibly anything like this for fatalism and indeterminism? I have access to MLA Bibliography and the Philosopher's Index through my university's online databases.\n\nThanks for the help!",

I would like to explore how the use of a protagonist on the autistic spectrum is relatable to adolescents who are coming to face with more complex social situations at their stage of development. I believe the protagonists' objective observations yet unshaking inner convictions is similar to the adolescent mindset when they are coming into new social complexities. This acts as a device to introduce adolescents to more turbulent emotion and how they may come to terms with the worlds' complexity.'\n\nAnd received this as a reply: ...you need to do research on approaches and concerns of YA literature then, 'The focus of your analysis will then be on the way the text presents perspective.' What does this mean?\n\nI developed a hurried thesis: 'Autism acts as a hyperbole for child consciousness to emphasize the difficulties in transitioning into adolescence'. I wrote a few paragraphs separately on autism, adolescence and childhood then realized what I wrote was nonsensical as I couldn't connect them and relate them to the novel.\n\nI then devised to revise my thesis hoping I would have an easy time with citing sources: 'Christopher’s autistic perspective facilitates adolescents' identity formation process.' I didn't.\n\nI am still left confused as to whether my theses are appropriate for a children's literature analysis. How do I go about analyzing a novel with respect to its perspective? What is the goal/purpose of analyzing literature?\n\n*Side note: I also have extreme difficulty writing long papers. I offer about two sentences and feel like I've exhausted what I can say on the topic. Any tips to remedy this would be much appreciated!*\n",

        "text": "Specifically I am looking for criticism, literary theory, philosophy, anthropology, whatever.. considering : Daemonic-Dread (the shudder from the ghost) / Sleep Paralysis, *with* winter *and* lament . It's important from an anthropological literary point of view since Otto was considering the gothic horror story as a powerful means of elucidating upon the sacred . However, he ignored some important further considerations due to his rejection of animism in favour of Christianity in terms of the power of the ghost within the Nether-World as far as a means of reconciliation and catharsis/lament. Hell is a sad cold place. I had this realization in reading and studying S.Korean culture that they frequently meditate upon these themes of the gothic and I became intrigued to more closely examine this in English literature and popular culture . \n\nI'd have to write an enormous essay to analyze what I am talking about but basically I am an English literature major (undergrad) and I'm interested in literary criticism from an archaically trans-national and perennial point of view . For example, I'm probably one of the few people interested seriously in anthropology fondly attached to Rudolf Otto naive enough I guess to not realize I'd be chopping off my own head to have this Victorian outlook.. but there are literary critics today and anthropologists who feel he's made a comeback of a sort since the 1990s into a kind of undeniable status of critical importance. If you search for Rudolf Otto citations you'll find a lot of film criticism like on the monolith from 2001 A Space Odyssey or to do with asian horror movies like Shutter . I'm chiefly an English major and I haven't studied much anthropology yet, I've already fielded these concepts in anthropology boards with examples and analysis but got no interests . If you're going to respond to this thread and seriously try to help me please be totally wild and crazy and prepared to accept consciousness , the imagination, and the noetic, as a valid means of reason and knowledge. Otherwise, don't read books and don't respond. Besides A Game Of Thrones, an example of the noetic would be [Stephen King's Under the Dome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Y5YeYrqUk)\n\nIt might be better stated to point out that what Rudolf Otto was trying to examine was literary, that is rational.. we can articulate this and we use words like grisly, august, eerie, weird, and so on.. but he goes further and totally fascinatingly begins running through based on Kant and schematization a bunch of descriptions for what he felt were the raw emotions of religion ironically of a particularly dark nature as we say our hair stood on end and our flesh crept.. so although he was interested in how we articulate those feelings, he was more interested in how irrational they were. This is why Hideous Gnosis (I'm serious) , the book on black metal, is a great suggestion in this pool of references I'm trying to build up (as a professional! come on help me..) because it's getting at this raw non-rational emotive fixation within pop culture to horror . \n\nin other words.. if you have little familiarity with Otto it will be hard to discuss in this thread . \n\nMy recommendations / hermeneutics , \n\n**The Idea Of The Holy** by Rudolf Otto -- Before anyone recommends this yes , I am already familiar with it. I actually just purchased this on amazon along with [Ghostbusters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vntAEVjPBzQ). Two things I think Otto overlooked are climate and catharsis or lament . I feel that New England spooks is particularly acclimatized to wintry weather . You wouldn't be able to make sense of a story like John Carpenter's **The Thing**, or Algernon Blackwood's **The Wendigo**, within the jungles of South Africa . There is a markedly different feeling expressed in Elizabeth Gaskell's **The Old Nurse's Story** ratcheting up the shuddering spookiness specifically because the story takes place during winter . Daemonic-Dread shudder from the ghost is particularly accentuated, at night, for mystical effect, and no other time of the year is as mystical as lightly falling snow and the darkest time of the year. \n\n**The Gift** by Marcel Mauss -- Along with humility from creature-consciousness abased before the awesome tremendous grandeur of the numinous ( Rudolf Otto 101 ), Mauss suggests something we can examine - moving from Otto's foundational ideas of daemonic-dread and cathartic energy release as a starting point - a transfer of mana at the root of archaic economies . If Idea Of The Holy is almost entirely about Shinto, then Mauss' principle of Reciprocity is a book that gets underneath the power exchanges of religious worship. I don't think you can fully appreciate Otto without understanding Mauss. \n\n**Coleridge And The Daemonic Imagination** by Gregory Leadbetter\n\n**Hideous Gnosis: Black Metal Theory Symposium I** \n\n**Sleep Paralysis: Night-Mares, Nocebos, And The Mind-Body Connection** by Shelley R. Adler -- A book that examines the science of sleep paralysis and suggests that night-mares could be a way into a higher form of consciousness . \n\nI've asked my english professor for books and so far he's recommended me these, \n\n**A Strange Manuscript Found In A Copper Cylinder** by James De Mille -- Exactly what I am talking about. Canadian hyperborean gnosticism. In making this reddit post though I was more interested in literary criticism and literary theory, like Otto's work. This is a story about a man who gets lost in Antarctica and uncovers a cave system into a hyperborean-like Hell, superheated by volcanoes in the middle of antarctic wilderness, but populated by sleep paralysis inducing night-mare hags who have achieved a kind of enlightenment through the worship of death and Maussian principle of reciprocity . This form of worship - of the 'Old Hag' - is characterized by an immensely strong sense of lament characteristic of Dante's Inferno or Milton's Paradise Lost. Ironically I felt the book wasn't as daemonically dreadful as you'd expect, but it is very *sad* and I use that word with special meaning.  \n\nMy professor's recommendations , \n\nDuerr's **Dreamtime : Concerning The Boundary Between Wilderness And Civilization**\n\nEnnemoser's **History of Magic**\n\n Harold Bloom's **The Flight to Lucifer**\n\n David Lindsay's **A Voyage to Arcturus**\n\n Ignatius Donnely's **Ragnarok and Atlantis**;\n\n Mallet's **Northern Antiquities** (Henry Bohn edition). \n\n\n******\n\nsome quick videos to get you thinking ,\n\nopening to the [He-Man children's cartoon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yeA7a0uS3A) . A very dark show.. kind of hyperborean-ish . Has this circling of themes.. daemonic-dread, and shamanism, and a mystical kind of darkness . Not particularly 'sad' being a children's show but not particularly happy either. \n\nKorean television show [The Moon That Embraces The Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXi2hhfXn6w) . This has the cluster of emotions I'm looking for.. sleep paralysis, shamanism, coldness and daemonic-dread, sadness, and so on.. \n\nKorean television show [The Master's Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALdhqC2-eBE) . When we think of Rudolf Otto we think of a deer in headlights . I'd go further to say that we think of a deer in headlights in the middle of winter at night on a snowy road . As dark and cold and shivering as possible.\n\n[Hamlet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rd74Gniz-A)\n\n[Stir Of Echoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCge9ZoU-ys)\n\n[Solarfall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meIh4oZ-hNs) by Immortal ,  [All Shall Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOOebk_dKFo) music video.\n\n****\n\nfrom Chongho Kim's **Korean Shamanism : The Cultural Paradox**\n\n-A Haunted Feeling-\nSoh Bosal started the kut ritual with a drum, sitting together with Oki's Mother on the mat. It was a very cold and windy night even though it was spring. Everything seemed to be frozen in the spring cold. It was so cold that I came back to the car for a rest while Soh Bosal performed the first phase of the kut. I was not keen to observe the first phase, because it just consisted of routine procedures. I took a cigarette out of my pocket and put it in my mouth. Suddenly I felt a strong haunted feeling in the air around me. It felt as if a ghost was going to jump in front of the windscreen. I was so scared that I felt goose bumps appearing on my skin, and a shiver ran down my spine. I turned on the car's interior light and looked in the rear vision mirror, because it felt as though a ghost was about to enter the car through the rear windscreen and squeeze my neck from the back seat. I locked all of the doors. But still the spooky feeling did not go away. So I switched on the radio and turned up the sound ... I began to talk to myself ... [What] is the reason I was possessed by a haunted feeling just now? ... What did Mirim's Mother say to you? She said, \"I do not like to see kut rituals, where there seem to be lots of ghosts around. I feel as if worms are going around my body.\" Yes! The haunted feeling ... Chisun's Grandmother said to me, \"... The waves of life made me know this way.\" ... Linda ... asked me in a letter \"Why do they take responsibility for the 'dark' side of life?\" ... I continued to talk to myself... Because of the dark side of social life, there is a cultural domain dealing with the experience of misfortune in Korean culture. In contrast to ordinary domains, the field of misfortune is full of darkness and dampness. Look at this kut for Oki's Mother! Isn't it full of darkness? ... It is my impression that shamanism looks like a poisonous creature. Korean shamanism is very colourful: its dances and music are dynamic, and costumes are full of bright colour. However, most adult Koreans know that its poisonousness. This is why Yongki's Mother said, \"I'm not going to a kut ritual because I am afraid of being possessed by the spirits!\" (kwisine ssiuiulggaba). Is there any ordinary Korean who likes to be possessed? This is why they don't like to be involved in shamanic practices. This is why shamanism has been stimatized in Korean history. This is also why my research has encountered such strong resistance in the field. The field which I have been investigating is the field of misfortune! Why do people seek shamanic practices even though they don't like shamanism? How can this paradox be explained? Yes! Like cures like. The mode of shamanic healing is homeopathic. It is like using derivates of poison when one is bitten by a venomous snake. In Korean society, there is no one who suffers from misfortune more than the shaman, and no man or woman ever wants to be a shaman. The shamanic illness, an extreme of misfortune, makes the shaman a healer. ... the Stick held by Oki's Mother still showed no sign of being possessed, even though it sometimes shivered a little bit. Soh Basal asked again, \"Is it like something has come?\" Oki's Mother replied shakily, \"Well... I don't know. The Stick shivered a little bit… \"\n\n*****\n\nA Game Of Thrones is too obvious to mention . \n\nthe idea of a hyperborea beyond the wall, roaming with the undead ready to impose sleep paralysis at any moment. behind the wall people don't *know*, the houses behind the wall are asleep to the *reality* that is beyond civilization in the fantasy dream realms. the idea of dreaming reality infringing on the peace and safety of a people who have forgotten magic is a major theme in this story",

I'm currently working on a long-form academic research project situated firmly in 19th century transatlanticism.  My goal is to trace the way that the globalization of the American myth--as defined by scholars like Henry Nash Smith and David Hamilton Murdoch--affected English Victorian literature at the time.  I argue that the presence of uniquely Western characters in Victorian literature demonstrates England's fascination with the potential of the American project as well as shows the ways in which American ideals had begun to permeate and influence English literature and social thought.\n\nRight now I'm trying to find more books that lend themselves to this research.  My major texts are Stoker's *Dracula,* Conan Doyle's *A Study in Scarlet,* and Burnett's *A Fair Barbarian.*  At this point I'm trying to find more texts that fit the bill.  Short stories, novels, high lit, penny dreadfuls...any and all works that deal with the American West *in any way, shape, or form* are welcome.\n\nBeyond that, I'd also appreciate some help with theoretical models, too.  I'm planning on looking at gender and queer theory, both of which I have a strong handle on.  I could use some advice about colonial theory that might fit the bill here, since I'm much less familiar with that area of expertise.  I'm also looking for some historical or theoretical texts about Victorian frontiersm, too.  Please feel free to dump mountains of theoretical texts on my doorstep.  \n\nAgain, I apologize if these questions aren't appropriate for /r/askliterarystudies.  I wasn't sure where I could post questions about literary scholarship if not here!",

        "text": "So as part of the IB's extended essay, I analysed Homer's comments on the consequences of pride in the Iliad. After submitting a draft, I found that I cannot do a translated work as a single text study. Instead, I need to construct a comparison with another text but this text must originally be written in English.\n\nSo really what I'm asking is, does anyone know of texts, written in English, which look in depth at the consequences of pride and the ego? So far, my search has really only yielded Shakespeare's Coriolanus as a possibility.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "As this subreddit continues to grow, the mods thought it might be best to put down some guidelines concerning top-tier answer quality. We've never had any official policy regarding \"acceptable\" and \"unacceptable\" answers, so let's use this thread as a conversation about what criteria might make for a good answer in this sub. Here's what /r/sushisushisushi and I have come up with for baseline requirements for a good answer:\n\n**Answers in this subreddit should be both comprehensive and informative.** Specifically, that means:\n\n* **Be thorough.** The people who ask questions here are curious, and we're all obviously interested in reading in-depth answers. If you answer a question, you are implicitly claiming to be an expert - show us some of your expertise! Also, avoid just posting a link or a source as an answer. Explain why that source is relevant to the question.\n\n* **Cite sources**. Treat your answers like you would an academic article. Use textual evidence or scholarly sources to back up your claim. Avoid recourse to wikipedia whenever possible. If you took a course on the subject, provide the relevant reading rather than the course itself as a source to your answer. \n\n* **Avoid technical jargon** If you feel your answer requires jargon (and some certainly do), be sure to carefully explain it in laymans terms. Also, consider addressing *why* you need to use jargon in your answer if you do use it. Not all readers are experts - this is the very reason this sub exists! \n\n\n\n* **Treat others with respect.** This is a pretty obvious one, and you have been self-policing in this regard already. However, it bears repeating: Don't ridicule or insult other users. This is neither helpful nor productive. Take out your aggression at next year's MLA conference instead. \n\n* **\n\nSince this is an evolving community, we also invite users - both flaired and not - to discuss these guidelines in this thread. Don't think this is the start of some brutal policy change; we just want us all to collectively consider what could make this sub better. A social contract if you will. As you all know \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains\" ...",

What do I do if I actually track down a better version of my paper? Do I give up?\n\nAlso, can anyone help me with databases that are more helpful than l'Annee philologique (overbroad, half the stuff is impossible to track down, haaaaate only getting a short little nothing of an abstract at best) or JSTOR?\n\nI know this is a lot but I always struggle with term papers.

        "text": "I am planning to apply to graduate school for Fall 2015 (so I've got a while to accomplish this), and the application requires a ten-page essay. I was a creative writing major in undergraduate, and perhaps it says something about the university I went to, or the classes I took, or that I only had to take the minimum-required literature courses, but I never had to write a 10-page literary criticism paper. Most were around 5 pages, and just a couple were around 8, but I don't really remember them, so I doubt that they'd be worth going back to try to add two pages. I graduated in 2011 and feel very out of practice.\n\nI just finished Catch-22 (spoilers) with the idea in mind to write an essay about the effect of non-present characters, like the dead man in Yossarian's tent; Major Major, who won't see anyone in his office unless he's not there; Doc Daneeka, after he's bureaucratically killed in McWatt's plane; Major -- de Coverly; Wintergreen's interferences; and so on, and while there are plenty of instances of this, I can't quite seem to come up with an outline that would merit 10 pages of text, and I'm even having trouble trying to come up with ways to write about it that aren't just plot summary. The only valid point I've come up with for this is that those who are not present generally seem to hold some sort of power over those who are, and those who are supposed to be hidden but reveal themselves (like the CID men in the hospital or Doc Daneeka, after he \"died\"), have the least power. That's all well and good, but I am stuck from there. I don't want to just have ten pages of reiterating the same point with different examples.\n\nI could definitely try a different prompt or idea for Catch-22, as I've read it several times and just finished it again yesterday. Another I had considered was comparing works where the protagonist is the only sane character but seen as \"insane\" from the perspectives of the other characters in the work, like Yossarian, MacMurphy, or Darl.) \n\nMy other idea was to write an essay about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (sort of spoilers?), detailing why it was important that Oskar's father died in the Sept. 11 terror attacks as opposed to something else, like a car accident. Here I think I could easily get 10 pages out of it, also using other criticism, but I can't figure out here how to fit the actual text in. If I can figure out a good way to do this one, I think it will be the more interesting choice, considering the target reader is probably going to be someone sitting in a room reading through tons of applications. I doubt they'll get another essay for this novel, and the topic is somewhat controversial.\n\nPerfume: The Story of a Murderer is also another work I could do with a topic like \"is it possible to be sympathetic to a murderer?\" but I'm not sure if that's a common topic or not, though I'm sure the book isn't.\n\n**TL; DR**Suggestions on how to get over this hump (even if just in general)? Are there any good, free sources online for me to read other ~10 page critical essays so I can get back into the swing of what these look like? Good sources for essay topics for this length? Specific suggestions on my ideas?\n\nAnything will help! Thanks!",

I wanted to thank you all for your input. The feedback and questions I got from a lot of the attendees didn't quite engage with the postcolonial and queer theory as much as I would have liked, but you can never truly tell how an audience is going to respond to any work. It was still a successful panel and I feel tremendously grateful that I got to do it. Thanks for helping make it possible!",

I'm currently looking into trauma and memory studies, or more specifically, in terms of how memory is unconsciously shaped by trauma, reconstructing memory in an attempt to cope with the trauma of either absence or loss, and how this reconstructed memory affects the how the narrative unfolds (I'm thinking along the lines of the narrator's unreliability stemming from the trauma of loss or something like that).\n\nHowever, I'm relatively new to this area of Literary Studies, so what I'm asking for is help with where to begin reading. I've read my fundamental Psychoanalyst texts such as Freud and Lacan( even Kristeva and Deleuze&amp;Guattari if that matters), which I assume would be fundamental in further studies into trauma proper. \n\nI'm willing to go for both article-length and book-length resources, although I'd much prefer the former since I have my actual research to do on the side. I'm really really not familiar with trauma studies though, so if anyone can recommend any crash course resource (a la Zizek's how to read Lacan), that would be most welcome too. \n\nThanks in advance! :) \n",

I have a suspicion that someone will mention The Waste Land, but without a little explanation, it doesn't seem quite as epic, or perhaps universal, as what Blake was attempting with Vala.\n\nSimilarly, with the question about wholly metaphorical novels (or epic poems), I mean a work of decent size that makes little sense if read literally on a sentence by sentence level, but if every sentence is treated as a metaphor, a sense of narrative jumps out. The Four Zoas fails in this regard, since there is a clear series of actions made by consistent characters. On the other hand, it can be read as purely metaphorical, so it is close. Finnegan's Wake might be a better candidate, but I'd like to find something that's less caught up with phonics...\n\nLastly, and even less related. What do you guys think a literary work by a consciousness that is significantly beyond a human would look like? I ask this, because I think the range of answers might be useful to new forms of modernist thought in the creation of literary works.\n\nI usually consider the distance between dogs to humans and try to forecast out past human thought. Dogs and humans use the same tools, body language and phonemes (growls, yelps, whimpers), but humans add greater subtlety to these tools, and use them in much greater frequency. Additionally, a human can communicate everything a dog could ever communicate in a couple paragraphs.\n\nAnother route to take is that of a human consciousness a dimension higher. What cubism and futurism are for art, this would be for literature. Or specifically, if earth had developed with humans able to see through time as well, how would language and stories be different?",

Our program is very broad and doesn't require a thesis, just a comprehensive exam spanning the past three years of graduate classes. As a result, my interests vary highly and my knowledge does as well. One area that I lack in is Romanticism (excepting the Gothics), specifically Blake. The professors at my school mostly avoid Blake with a few exceptions--I find this to be very understandable. \n\nMy main question is if anyone here is familiar with a decent history of criticism surrounding Blake? I'm currently swamped with books about Blake ranging from Frye's *Fearful Symmetry* up through Bloom's criticism. \n\nI'm curious to this because, while I've already found one \"history,\" specifically, *William Blake and the Impossible History of the 1790s,* I'm not 100% on it's viability as a successful critical history. (Translation: I haven't had time between teaching and classes to parse it thoroughly, but have a gist of it).\n\nIf anyone has used a particular critical history that is concerned with shifts in criticism about Blake, I would very much appreciate it! I'm planning on doing a metafictive analysis of *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* for our upcoming symposium, but the committee requires a full paper, not just an abstract (truly astounding, if you ask me). \n\nThanks for any leads you might have for me!

But then the interesting part comes in, namely that the poem reverts back to dawn and gives an account of that same day with regard to how Gawain spends it. Then the poem goes back a third time(!!!) to address particulars of the hunt (usually spending quite a bit of time on gory details of butchering). In essence, the poet describes each of the three days three times. \n\nI picture the structure as a sort of spiral, but I don't know if that's helpful. It's not recursive because the details change quite a bit with each reiteration of the passage of the day, but is there a good way to describe this narrative move? \n\nAny help/discussion is greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks, \n\n-Rizzpooch\n\nEdit: And now that I've begun thinking more deeply about it, it occurs to me that the ABCDEDCBA structure isn't recursion.
