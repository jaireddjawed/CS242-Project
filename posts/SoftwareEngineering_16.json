I wanted to go for my master's but i'm bit confuse, so I need some of your help. So, I'm thinking to get masters in either software engineering or Business and Information System. I'm having difficulty picking one major.\n\nNow since I already have a computer science degree, would it make sense to get a software entering degree? Or should i just go for Business and Information system. I don't want to code all my life. Let me know what you guys think should be a better path for me. Also I would like to know what are my options with Business and information degree?\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "So on Friday I will complete my first internship, hr has requested a re-submission of  my resume as I have been offered a co-op position but not with my current working group. They wish this new resume to reflect what I have done over the summer. I have a degree in math and am currently a grad student studying software engineering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem, I studied math and currently study software engineering and am at best the most okiest at English. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what may help is if I explain to the best of my ability what I actually did, then what I currently have on my resume and if anyone has any critic or recommendation please share. I know I am terrible at writing any and all comments are welcomed.\n\n- my first task was to create 1st compile 2 years worth of data into sql tables that will be used in statistical forecasting models then automate this process such that the tables update themselves on a monthly basis with new raw data. \n\n    - create automated cost control tables using Microsoft Access and VBA\n\n- second task was to create a cost savings report, this report has utilization cpus in millions of instructions per second for some mainframes. these mainframes are then split into logical partitions, the again split into applications. Now I was either going to program this or use this ten year old code that is used by higher ups, managers, and internally by the teams to view exactly what I have above or much more. The problem was that this code was never intended to be used in the way I did. I changed the interface of this code and used it as my own to generate auto reports. Then I created functions to operate on these reports (2 charts sheets and 2 raw data sheets 2 miscellaneous data sheets ) to create more custom reports which were being generated by hand. Because I choose the wonky way of doing things I was able to automate 14 reports pretty over the summer which were done in the middleish end of the month. Now they are generated on the 2nd of the month in a matter of ~ 2 1/2 minutes. \n\n    - automated cost saving report and all related reports(13) using vba, microsoft access, and auto pc by changing the interface of an advanced form and using it in a way that it was never intended. \n\n- 3rd task was randomly handed down to me. apparently some math gal created a forecasting tool. however it was not structure like a program should be ?? some corrections to the forecast had to be made (nothing wrong with the math however an application was being reduced) so some changes had to be made as to how the program was written, basically I had to split portions of the program so that another portion could be inserted into the forecasting. \n\n    - added functionality to internal statistical forecasting tool \n\n- lastly I took the forecasting tool and wrote the program in R, the team is moving to sas but want to  also explore R. So i did the initial exploration and simply showed how a workflow would work with R as apposed to sas or excel... I did not write anything for this b/c I'm not really sure how to add this to my resume, and thought coming here and then to r/SoftwareEngineer would net me better results. \n\nagain all comments negative or positive or any suggestions are welcomed. \n\nThank you kindly good sirs and madams ",

I’ve learned a lot about how financial markets work, got a good understanding of the financial services industry and also learned to prospect/pitch/close business etc. I hold a Masters Degree in Finance.\n\nJust like with many jobs I feel like I am approaching the plateauing part of my learning curve. The job is not difficult, pay is good but I am quite bored and definitely don’t envision myself enjoying this in the next few years. \n\n*My ultimate goal is to start my own company (software/web) before I’m 30. * being able to work remotely is also a secondary goal but not as important as starting my own business. \n\nMy company offers me an opportunity to learn basics of programming in my own (through some suggested online courses) and to then pair up with a mentor who’d prepare me for software engineering interviews. I would then go through an in-depth training and join the software engineering department. \n\nI don’t believe anyone should specialise in solely one field as there are always going to be specialists that know more / are better than you. The edge you can gain is when you are a polymath and become good at several things / areas. Also, because I don’t have a CS background I feel like this opportunity is rather unique. \n\nHow beneficial would transitioning to software engineering and learning to program would be in achieving my goal to start my own business ? Given I would in the end work for 2-4 years in software engineering I know I wouldn’t become the #1 programmer but it would give me a solid base of technical knowledge and develop my problem solving capacity. \n\nSorry if this was long, thank you for reading and let me know if you have any thoughts ! \n\n",

        "text": "I am on a team that is starting to move towards a Behavior Driven Development testing solution to support our CI/CD pipeline to increase our confidence in our product.\n\nI'm curious, what does your team do for testing? Automated testing? What have you seen that works? What have you seen that becomes cumbersome and inefficient?\n\n Edit: Motivation behind this post: I just want to know what is going on at other shops. I have my small sliver of experience and what I can gather from articles, books and blogs. I'm hoping some of your answers can provide jumping off points for ideas or motivation in my teams testing approaches. ",
