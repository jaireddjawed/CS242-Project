Now, after the advent of antibiotics and vaccines (in the places where people have access to such innovations), death by infectious disease is at an all-time low; however, there has been a surge in death by coronary disease and cancer, diseases which become more likely with age.\n\nMy point is, every time humans made a significant extension to their life expectancy, their lives were limited by a new disease or condition. In this case, what are the major threats to human health or life you think will arise the next time we make a major leap in longevity? What would ail us if we ever become immortal?\n\n ",

Whilst young people can wait for a few more decades, those in middle age are much more concerned. According to statistics, new drug development takes 17 years on average, but the countdown only begins at the moment when the underlying mechanisms are investigated well enough – which cannot be said about the mechanisms of aging.\n\nWe have made great progress in understanding aging in the last decade thanks to the march of technology. One solution to an aging process is entering human clinical trials this year: a therapy to remove aged damaged cells to promote tissue repair and reduce chronic inflammation. This is of course fantastic news but progress is still too slow.\"\n\nFull Article: http://www.leafscience.org/bottlenecks-in-research/\n\nWe are interested in hearing your views and opinions on these bottlenecks and hope we might have a useful discussion here.",

        "text": "I have wanted something like this for some time and think that the technology might be progressing at a rapid enough pace that a solution should become available in the near future. Before I discuss why a person might want or need this type of device implanted into them, let me detail what some of the obvious limitations are.\n\nPulling power directly from the human body is not a very reliable way to power such a device. That would obviously need to be addressed, but could be supplemented with further augmentations to harness more kinetic energy or even having solar cells implanted on docking-type \"ports\" elsewhere on the epidermis. Solutions in this one particular area are the ones that I see requiring the most innovation.\n\nSecond, the design for the actual implementing of the device onto the forearm (either on the top or the bottom, or even both) would benefit from being modular and requiring very little invasive surgery. This would allow for similarly sized electronics to later be \"upgraded\" into the slots provided. The device that suffices today might be sorely outdated in a couple years time... rather than a bad tattoo that one regrets with old age, it would be best if the device here could constantly change with the times.\n\nReally, the prime implant is more the electronic components that allow for interfacing with the human biological systems on a surgical level and that take advantage of whatever power and other things can be drawn from the human body, with more of a \"skeleton\" for then adding components. In an ideal future, this may later function as a two-way street, allowing the gathering of data and other senses through the device, rather than the device just being a parasitic attachment onto the human organism.\n\nThe internal wiring that may connect the device on the arm with solar powered cells on the corresponding arm or from the top of the cranium down through to the actual device would likely be imperative in getting such a device functioning properly with the limits of the technology available today. Any other type of mechanism that could somehow harness power when there are no physical \"charging\" abilities present would need to be heavily considered. \n\nWhy would you want or need this device? Imagine it may be easier for some of you to contemplate a dystopian future where ready access to charging accessories and running power is not an option, or being thrust into conditions and environments where there does not happen to just be a wall \"power outlet\" within conceivable range or availability. In these extreme conditions, even extra batteries may be something that are in short supply or unavailable, making the device to perfection would require that it NEVER relies on external supplements or inputs, only what it can harness naturally. Even the solar powered cells should be scrutinized for their ability only to provide EXTRA power or function, rather than being a crutch that the system relies upon, because low-light conditions or inability to access the sun for long periods of time may be fairly normal when utilizing this device.\n\nHow did I come up with this idea? I was subjected to many years in federal prison in the United States. During that time, I longed for internet access and other basic, arguably human rights that technology can provide. I seen on numerous occasions that some prisoners had subdermal implants and other body modifications that the prison staff was NOT allowed to interfere with (none of them had the proper requisite certifications or training to safely remove such devices and it was determined on more than one occasion that a surgeon would be required to remove any such body modifications... something they were unwilling to transport a prisoner for, or pay for, as there are no current protocols for handling said situations and since it falls under a medical procedure, could easily be denied by the prisoner and not forced upon them).\n\nThat is where the seedling for this idea came from, as I've always been into transhumanism. God forbid I am ever kidnapped and imprisoned by my government again, but you never know in the prison-industrial complex of a society that we live in when people with riot gear will break down your door and haul you off to serve the rest of your life in prison for some minor or fabricated infraction.\n\nThe more I pondered on the device, the more problems I seen with it, but also the more potential. If the device works for a prisoner who may be in solitary confinement for some period of time, why could it not also benefit those exploring harsh climes, or complex cave systems and tunnels? If it benefits even those individuals, what about people who have just survived a cataclysmic, world-ending event? The space required to store the entire contents of much of the legacy internet (Wikipedia, mainly), a large library of music and other entertainment as well as useful applications and tools would be negligible even with the technology of 5 years ago.\n\nIf anybody has seen a similar device, please let me know. If a person has not tried such a technology before, I would not mind going through some of the associated risks (rejection, etc.) for trying such an implanted \"full function\" device out. \n\nReally the key thing that I think presents itself here is, how much interfacing can be done through the human biological organism and low profile \"smart\" technology available today? Is the information stream able to function both ways? If not, are there hacks and other things that could equate say, me closing to particular fingers on the opposite hand together in a certain way with sensors implanted in them and run to the device, into useful functions or commands for the device?\n\nAny comments and/or criticism, advice and links would be much valued and appreciated!",
