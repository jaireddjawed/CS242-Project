        "text": "My argument here boils down to a really simple cost/benefit analysis, which you are welcome to debate. I think immortality by necessity must grant a far better human condition than present, both psychologically and physiologically, but population pressure on the planet would have to be controlled significantly to allow such a human condition to be attained. Reasons for my belief follow:\n\n1) There's of course the obvious argument that immortality would allow individual knowledge/wisdom to attain far greater capacity. Just like the Asari race in the Mass Effect story, people would be able to attend school or do research for centuries and output a depth of understanding for society considered unrealistic by today's standards. Geniuses like Einstein and Newton could live on and continue making discoveries to further the human condition.\n\n2) Then there's the Malthusian argument: A focus on quality over quantity beats the other way around. Fewer people means less stomachs to feed and less quarreling over limited resources imposed by nature, whether here on earth or elsewhere, while protecting natural habitats as well. After all, terrestrial bodies in the universe are limited in size anyway, before they're too massive to support bipedalism or even maintain their terrestrial state and becoming gas giants.\n\nInfighting among humans also occurs at both macro and micro scales sociologically speaking. Think about how multiculturalism / racialism in America has had the downside of creating a class struggle &amp; stratification over wealth &amp; status, as well as interpersonal bottlenecks throughout its history, for instance, leading to a strain on mental and physical health. The crisis in Syria, in part triggered by global warming, is yet another testament to this fact.\n\n3) If we can figure out immortality with the stated tradeoff, we could focus on higher level goals than simply to reproduce, which is often mentioned as being *the* goal of human life in the present. Advances from a transhumanistic perspective would allow us to improve our intelligence and well being in ways that prevent us from either succumbing to suicide or physical illness, and by necessity, this would allow us to find a meaningful life by expanding our creativity rather than seeking enjoyment through sex.\n\nOTOH, the main argument I can make for keeping our natural sex drives (from a utilitarian standpoint) is the fact that better minds are yet to be made that can vastly improve the human condition down the line. Genetic engineering is currently advancing to amplify intelligence among new embryos first and foremost, whereas with existing humans, only epigentic modifications are currently thought to be possible. But with 7.2 billion humans alive today, and 12 billion projected by  mid century, I think we'll have more than enough to figure out how to achieve the transhumanist goals stated in favor of the immortality argument.\n\nHuman civilization was able to advance over millennia, only through the gradual diminishment of primal urges. First by society punishing rape and violent impulses, but sexual impulses in general don't seem to be exempt from such a curtailing in the long term.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and counter-arguments? I apologize for my overly condensed lines of reasoning in interest of time, however.",

I recently attained my class reunion and the difference in personality, goals, and well being between me and people just ten years ago I would have called my peers was astounding.

        "text": "I debated some of my friends over drugs recently to see their viewpoint. I have to say that most of them are completely in for the version where all drugs are vilified refusing to react to any piece of information or arguments , challenging their view, in any ways whatsoever. Something that I got as an answer is that we would be better off banning each and every psychoactive drugs we know of, thus ending hypocrisy.\n\n\nI however think that consuming anything should be a right of which you suffer the consequences if there is any to begin with. We do not ban everything on the notion that we can easily kill people with it, neither should we do that to drugs because they change the state of our mind.\n\nI myself never used much drugs I know of (I hope I do not have to say that it includes alcohol) and may not have that wide knowledge of the topic. So I would have the question in the title to all of you, who might have more expertise or experience in these matters.",

All this despite the fact that sex is arguably the most natural behavior in humans and all animals, and what drives the evolutionary process.\n\nOne argument would be that it's culture-specific. However, I would say that in most cultures today we generally see the same attitude. I'm from one probably of the most liberal, open-minded parts of the world (Denmark), but even here you certainly don't talk openly about sex or in any way treat it as the very natural thing it is.\n\nReligion has probably had a lot to say throughout the centuries to demonize sex as impure and somehow \"sinful\". This again begs the question, why people have had the need to paint sexuality in such a bad light.\n\nI hope some of you have some interesting theories, or may have studied this subject yourselves. I'm very interested in what you have to say, as I think this subject is very fascinating. ",

        "text": "In the video of the Robert E. Kelly interview, people (wrongfully) assumed the Asian woman was the children's nanny. Naturally, others condemn such assumptions as racism. This got me thinking, is perpetuating a stereotype racist?\n\nGoogle says the definition of racism is: \"prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior\"\n\nHowever, Merriam-Webster states the third definition of racism is \"racial prejudice or discrimination\", which I view as appropriate to the assumptions in question.",
