I'm looking for recommendations on a PCI or PCI-Express based DAQ and compatible software that will let me schedule data dumps to a well-known format.  Please take a look at the product I've linked below, as those specifications are what I'm roughly looking for.\n\nEssentially, I'm planning on deploying industrial PCs in various environments and getting acoustic measurements from sensors.  The software piece(s) I'm writing will take the data dumps from these sensors and upload them to a master server where I can manipulate the data as needed.\n\nInitially I was looking at something like Adlink's DAQe-2213/2214 (http://www.adlinktech.com/PD/web/PD_detail.php?pid=665), which meets my hardware requirements.  Unfortunately, their software support doesn't seem to offer any kind of automation where the data can be dumped at regular intervals -- and their log files are in a proprietary format.\n\nThus far, it seems like my best option may be to use MATLAB to record the data and write to CSVs at regularly intervals that my software can interpret and upload back to me.\n\nThanks!",

The video description says that the spectrum analyzer is based on the vu-meter previously designed. The vu-meter which it is referring to is [here](https://youtu.be/5WrANIQIiXI?t=27). \n\nNow, I have screenshot the [schematic](http://imgur.com/ci2a8fW) of the vu-meter. Studying the schematic, I understood that he is using LM324 Op-Amps as comparators, and comparing the input voltage with series of voltage dividers. I think I understand the basic principle of how the vu-meter works. \n\nBut I have a few questions. If I want to use my phone's audio output as an input to the vu-meter, wouldn't it be too low? Should I use a non-inverting Op-Amp to increase the voltage first and then use the increased voltage as my input to the vu-meter?\n\nNow comes the spectrum analyzer part. I know Op-Amps can be used as band-pass filters. Can I use LM324s in [this](http://imgur.com/0AFelQ2) configuration to implement the filters? If not, what better ways are there to implement the analyzer?\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n\n\n",

It seems to encompass a lot of circuit design and understanding of transistors which is up my alley.  At the same time I don't know how much this class would benefit me in the future unless I pursue a grad degree in the area. It may help me develop a better understanding of what goes on internally in regards to chips I may use in the field as well as some more transistor knowledge but overall seems like the experience I gain may not be incredibly beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand we have Power Electronics.  I'm quite interested in the subject as well but maybe not quite as much as Analog IC.  But it seems a better understanding of power electronics may be a lot more beneficial in the field in regards to switching power supplies and gaining a deeper understanding of energy conversion on a circuit level. \n\n\nSo overall I'm more interested in the details of Analog IC but feel that power electronics may be more beneficial if I do not pursue a graduate degree in Analog IC.  I'm just looking for any advice based off experience of other individuals in this sub \n\n\n",

This is just an example to give an idea about the general principle of using extremely simple computing inside a medical nanoparticle:\n\nOn every clock cycle, the sensor sends either 1 or 0 to a 7-bit counter circuit A. 1 means that \"yes, the identification factor has been observed in this clock cycle\". This causes adding one to the number in counter A / incrementing counter A by 1 ( new_N=old_N+1 ). Every 12 cycles counter b rolls over to zero after incrementing 1 at every cycle and causes counter A to subtract by one ( new_N=old_N-1 ).\n\nIf counter A ever reaches number 90, it means that the sensor is sending \"yes\" results often enough to overcome the constant subtracting caused by counter b. This could trigger release of chemical.\n\nCounter A could reach 127 if starting from 0. Counter b has to be at least 4 bits to express 12.\n\nOne possibility for some other purpose: make the computing circuitry a *finite-state machine* without any counters or numbers.\n\nIf the tiny devices can be larger, like cell size 10 micrometers, there could be some actual computers with capacity similar to the Apollo guidance computer, commodore 64 or zx spectrum.\n\nIn case anyone is wondering, the energy comes from blood just like with cells.\n",

Simple analog amplifiers and micro with a few IOs for the most part. \n\nRight now I work for a bigger company but in a small group. when I came in they really didn't know anything about PCBs and how I could help them. At the moment I'm mostly redoing old projects and taking dev boards and making more professional looking designs on a single board type of thing. Now that they know what I'm capable of I want to start trying to push my knowledge further but in a way that's beneficial to my group.   \n\nI am the expert in this group for electrical design unfortunately. That's only a problem in that I have no one to help me find a direction so to speak. I'd like to start designing boards with more complex processors and memory but I'm having a hard time finding the right searches to get started somewhere. \n\nmy group does a lot with image inspection and my boss wants me to start learning computer vision type processing and I feel like this is how I get to start designing more complex boards. \n\nI can basically buy any dev board and whatever books I want to try and learn what I need on my own but once again, where do I start? \n\nSo after all that, here's my question, what am I looking to do? Should I be looking into FPGA design or can I do this on some ARM device or should I start by learning something like openCV in python? \n\nAny help you could give would be greatly appreciated. \n\ntl;dr\nI want to design more complex boards, my group does a lot of image processing for inspection application (measurements and defects and such). Boss wants us to start learning computer vision, what do I start learning to do computer vision and design boards to handle the processing? ",

Locally changing each nodeX to weightedCoinFlipOfChance(1/(1+e^-sum(nodeY * weightXY))) guarantees convergence if weights are big enough.\n\nI'm looking for a kind of analog circuit design that can be tuned to chaoticly jump between such energy valleys powered by the heat of room temperature (which doesnt do much useful but chaotic jumping is one thing it does) and soon reach a valley low enough it stays until acted on again. It should only need a power source when changing its state to pull it out of such a valley.\n\nI'm a software and math person looking to build an experimental sensor that I'd plug into microphone hole of computer and do custom signal processing. This sensor is for experiments involving the total energy of the circuit falling into valleys, and there being exponential number of possible states of the circuit (within a single circuit, not quantum as its only 1 at a time, but still npcomplete). The purpose of the experiment is to directly cause statistical dependence between 2 such distant circuits then measure how much of it remains as slight entanglement when statistical inference is attempted from one to the other. So I need to understand what kind of circuits have multiple possible local minimums at a snapshot in time (best if electrostatic, or at least magnetostatic), preferably simpler kinds made of shapes of metal and EM only, but I suspect something like MOSFET may be needed.",

When I drained the capacitor through my scope, moments later it would shoot up to the positive rail again. \n\nThis stopped once I disconnected the output buffer, voltage across the cap stayed constant when sampled and didn't replenish when I drained it.\n\nThe opamp I used for the output buffer was an RC4560 (I liked the low input bias current).

I'm pushing towards an android/iOS application as they make up the vast majority of OS for tablets.\n\nA key functionality of the app is barcode scanning. The barcodes are 1 dimensional, and can be situated in awkward spots, sometimes &gt;30cm from the scanner (assuming the scanner is built into the tablet). I'm tossing up between specifying a camera scanner (which will be infinitely easier as most tablets have at least an 8 megapixel camera which should be sufficient for capturing barcode scanning), or specifying a laser barcode reader. I believe that only specialized tablets (namely Window OS tablets) integrate laser based readers, which changes our whole app specification.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience in barcode scanners, particularly in a tablet format?\n\nIn order of preference:\n\n1) we'd prefer the scanner to be built in to the tablet (ie, not a USB plug in accessory)\n2) accuracy, speed and efficiency. I realise both android and iOS plugins are available to use the built in camera as a reader, but these are dependent on light and stability (from my knowledge).\n3) overall evaluation of plug-in scanners if they are the only option. If we went the plug in route, omni-directional laser readers would be the preference, but again, a built in reader would be ideal.\n\nThe issue is that most of the barcodes are located at the tops of our doorway frames, so we need to consider that shorter staff may be at least 30cm (1 foot) away from barcodes that the scanners need to read if using a built in scanner on a tablet.\n\nGiven all those constraints, and a balance of scanning accuracy and limiting accessories with the tablet, can anyone comment on what would be ideal for our needs?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "Me and my roommates are planning on building LED beer pong modules as a summer project. The idea is that there are ten cup holes per module, each one with three LEDs around it. A proximity sensor beneath each hole can detect when a cup is placed in it, and through a nano Arduino change the color of the LEDs for that hole.\n\nMy roommates have the software side down, but on my end, I have almost no experience with diodes - specifically, how to distribute power for these addressable [RGB LEDs](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf). We're planning to have one Arduino control the LEDs for five holes, so for a single module that would be two Arduinos controlling 30 LEDs.  The LEDs themselves are not powered by the Arduinos, but we're hoping to have everything connected to a single portable battery pack.\n\nThe part I'm not sure about is if we can simply do a wiring scheme similar to [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/battery-power-for-led-pixels-and-strips/powering-the-microcontroller-too). I'm not sure if a LED strip is analogous to connecting a couple of our LEDs in series. Say we're talking about a half-module: what do we need to consider to connect a power supply in parallel with a nano Arduino and five branches of 3 LEDs in series? We'd probably need a resistor to drop the voltage to an acceptable level right before the five branches, but I'm confused about how much current is drawn, and how it would be distributed. This [page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/power) (for strips) says to multiply the number of LEDs you have by min/max brightness thresholds of 20 mA and 60 mA, respectively. But something about that seems off to me.\n\nAgain, I have very little experience with diodes - if the LEDs are in series, shouldn't their current be the same, and not simply add up like the article is suggesting? If one LED draws 20 mA, three of them in series should still be 20 mA, right? To be honest, I'm probably missing something very basic...\n\nAny advice and suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hi everyone, first time in this subreddit here. I wasn't sure whether it would be appropriate to put this in EE or ECE, so I'll just post it on both and we'll see how it works out.\n\nSo I'm a prospective electric engineer, mainly because I enjoy the multitude of places I could be working in and that I get to tinker with stuff, which has been a hobby of mine since I was very little. I'm going to be a junior in HS right now, and so far I've taken AP World my Sophomore year and gotten a 5 in the exam (gonna show those college admins how great I'll be at engineering now, bleh). Anyway, I'm taking AP Lang, AP Gov, Pre Calc, AP Physics and AP Stat as my core classes. I'm worried that all 4 of those AP classes will be too much workload on me to do extracurricular activities, which could carry a lot of weight alongside my academics. \n\nSo I'm debating on dropping AP Stat because on the surface I'm not seeing any benefits to taking it for the major I'll be pursuing. Am I missing anything here? Any advice is appreciated. \n\nIn my senior year I'll definitely be taking AP Calculus (not sure yet whether I'll take AB or BC), AP Physics 2 or Advanced AP Physics (the description of which leads me to believe it's like Physics C) or instead of Physics I might take AP Chemistry, and finally I'll also take AP Computer Science. I've never considered taking AP Chemistry but the collegeboard website says it'll help toward my major??? \n\nAlso the last question I had is that collegeboard also recommends AP Music Theory, how in the world would that help with Electrical Engineering? Here's a link: https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/exploreap/ap-and-your-future/major/electrical-engineering",

Is there a course or resources that is more \"ELI5\" that uses analogies and easy to understand explanations that you recommend?

With all the different avenues that can be taken (communications, power/distribution, electronics, etc.), my question for this sub is this: what do you think is going to be the best subset of EE knowledge that I can get out of an EE degree?\n\nBased on no foundation whatsoever, my guess is that power/distribution may be the way to go. Sure, it's not as sexy as any of the newer fields (like wireless communications, for example), but it also has steady demand. Specializing in any emerging technology could run the risk of that technology becoming obsolete (but also could be a technology that grows at the most rapid pace). My guess is that the majority of people specialize in power/distribution the least, so this specialism may be one that always demands engineers, but without the risk of learning an obsolete technology. My other thought is that with green energy constantly gaining global headway, incorporating green energy into distribution systems will only increase the demand for distribution/power engineers even moreso than the demand that exists now (in order to switch everything to green energy, plus the regular demand for new developments).\n\nWhat does r/ECE think? In 5-10 years from now, what's your best guess as to what the most valuable section of electrical engineering will be to know/have experience in?",

The only thing I've thought of is to have a \"debug\" version of the program that will include a suite of unit tests that the microcontroller will run before the main loop.

        "text": "Hello all! I am running into a bit of an issue: so I would love to work with computers, specifically hardware. Now, I do not want to just become a code monkey. Programming for me is a tool to do a job, not the job itself. I also have an interest in information security, which would make the coding a useful tool. That being said, I would be miserable just coding for a job. However, it seems like hardware jobs are declining in recent years.\n\nSo I am wondering, should I just major in EE instead? There's three extra classes I'd have to take and I'd have to drop my minor to maintain my math double major. In the end, would I be more competitive as an EE and not be pigeonholed into software engineering? Would it make me more versatile if I still did all the embedded systems courses typically taken by CompE majors?\n\nPlease let me know what you think.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the responses. Firstly, I just want to clarify that I actually like to code! It's no problem for me to actually code. I just don't want JUST coding to become my future career. Secondly, it seems as if y'all are saying something along the lines of hardware jobs are actually just becoming software jobs anyways. So would it be logical to draw a line from this to say that focusing a tad more on programming would be better if I would like to work on hardware?\n",

The book assigned by the instructor is microelectronics by sedra smith. I would like to actually learn the material in the book and really understand the world of electronics. \nI was wondering if anyone could give me any tips on how to learn and study from a textbook.

I currently work in the Power Distribution industry - more specifically, I'm an Electrical Engineer for an electrical contracting company doing commercial electrical infrastructure (mostly 600V or less). I have my EIT certificate and am probably going to take my PE exam in October. But, I am wanting a career change.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I enjoy what I do, I just wouldn't consider it a passion. My passion lies in electronics, and I think I want to do consumer electronics or at least something more focused on electronics. However, I have it in my head that companies would much rather take a fresh college grad than someone working in a completely different industry. Just being pessimistic? Hopefully. So my question is, has anyone made that kind of a switch before? If so, how difficult was it and what should I expect? Or what type of skills would be beneficial to that career path?\n\nThanks in advance for suggestions and advice!",

Once you've prototyped with the dev board, you just need to do your PCB layout to deliver power and IO to the proper places on the main chip. \n\nIs this correct?\n\nMy concern here is what hidden component costs are there when moving from the dev kit to the stand alone chip?\n\nThanks in advance. \n\n",
