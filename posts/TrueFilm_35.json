I really don't get it at all and don't understand why they would call each other by each other's names. Especially in the final scene when they're speaking on the phone together and Elio calls Oliver his name repeatedly. I just don't understand the point or why it seems to be a so called beautiful aspect of the movie (and book). Could someone offer an explanation!! ",

        "text": "I have tried several times to review this film, but it became too difficult to stay on message. I've taken a snapshot of what I've wanted to say in the hope that other people will engage with their interpretations. \n\nOne of the reasons *The Edge of Heaven* is so enthralling comes from, the director, Faith Akin’s ability to withhold judgment from his characters while still seemingly indicting the countries and institutions they live under. The portraits of the characters paint a large picture of the frailty of human life. Compounded with that frailty is the instability and uncertainty that immigration brings. The film is broken into three ominous yet inevitable sections: Yeter’s Death, Lotte’s Death, and The Edge of Heaven. I think this can be seen succinctly through sacrifices characters make. \n\n* Ayten Öztürk/Gul Kormaz  – Turkish political activist seeking asylum in Germany.\n* Nejat Aksu – Professor/ Bookshop owner\n* Yeter, Öztürk – Ayten’s mother/ Prostitute \n* Ali Aksu – Retired Turkish immigrant/Nejat’s father\n* Lotte- German student/ Ayten’s lover \n\n\n\n**Yeter’s Death**-\nWith Yeter, immigrants live in two worlds. Just because she now lives in Germany doesn’t mean her life is more stable or immune to the customs of her native land. While she is able to afford her own place the pressure of fundamentalist Islamic platitudes still hang over her. As two men spy on her attracting customers only to threaten her into repenting on the bus. Her arrangement with Ali also becomes a problem. It is completely transactional. She dies in a quick and careless moment because Ali feels entitled to her body not unlike Islamist hardliners that harassed her.\n\n**Lotte's Death**- \nAyten is not safe either. Her fate lies with German courts and later with the Turkish court. Her high-minded ideals and illegal form of protesting cause her to flee to Germany. She lives under an alias Gul Kormaz. Despite trying to keep a low profile she is stopped while looking for her mother. She and her lover, Lotte, must fight for asylum and free her from Turkish detention. Before this she wanders homeless in Germany until meeting Lotte who eagerly becomes her sole source of security. The power dynamic is reminiscent of Ali and Yeter, but the result is love. A genuine companionship. Yet their story ends in death. Lotte loses her life for love, however naive. And Ayten, once fiery and outspoken about a more progressive Turkey, repents those ideals which earn her freedom. Still, she is left with guilt and sadness. \n\n**The Edge of Heaven**- \nNejat is a German history professor.  He has fully integrated into German life. He is financially and professionally secure. He holds his father in deep affection until Yeter’s death. Nejat seeks out Ayten in Instanbul to atone for his father’s monstrous actions. As a side note, Nejat and Ali share their relative steady lifestyles in stark contrast with their female counterparts. Institutional and societal pressures don’t cause radical upheavals in their lives. Nejat fiercely disowns his father and outwardly leaves his career with relative ease. Nevertheless, Nejat gives up his old life. Running a bookshop, which serves an HQ for finding Ayten. He never finds her and ultimately sets out to reconnect with his father. \n\nI hung on to the edge of my seat hoping that everyone would meet and explain themselves. Of course, this never happens. Though, everybody seems to leave with some small consolation. It is without coincidence the film culminates on the Turkish holiday Bayram. A day celebrating Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God. As Yeter sacrifices her life for freedom, Lotte does the same for love, and Nejat gives upturns his life for the sins of his father. However, *The Edge of Heaven* seems to ask if the sacrifice to laws and institutions are really worth the human cost. ",

        "text": "Since it is May 1st and I recently rewatched the film, I decided this is a better time as any to discuss Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece, *Chungking Express*.\nNow to describe the film is a hard task to do because there are so many moving elements. Yes, it is a rom-com told through the lives of 2 cops, who are dealing with a break-up. But **IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT**.\nTarantino describes the film as having \"jumpy energy with a Godardian influence\". I think it is a very good way to describe film because *Chungking Express* is like Godard's *Breathless*, but *Chungking Express* has an indescribable quality that, IN MY OPINION, makes it better than *Breathless*. Don't get me wrong, *Breathless* is one my favorite movies of all time, but for me *Chungking Express* is a totally different type of movie.\n*Chungking Express* has so many elements that everyone can enjoy. It has the romance, it has the violence, and **THAT KILLER SOUNDTRACK**.\nThe film also has many idiosyncrasies that I can relate to and makes the film even better for me. The performances are also amazing, Tony Leung as the quasi-dejected cop and Faye Wong as the crazy and optimistic girl and Bridgette Lin as the withdrawn but deadly woman in the blonde wig and probably my favorite character from the film, Takeshi Kaneshiro as He Zhiwu. He disappears into that role completely. Those phone calls he makes always reminds me of Travis Bickle's (*Taxi Deriver*)phone call to his \"girlfriend\", but He Zhiwu's phone calls have a very \"careless\" quality, where Travis' phone call has very serious tone and a depressing quality. \n\nAnyway, hopefully you all enjoy *Chungking Express* as much as I do, and if you haven't seen it, maybe my Ebert-esque review got you to watch it. \n",

        "text": "(Article from my blog, copied in full to comply with the rules)\n\nSpoilers ahead; the plot has secrets in it that you may not wish to know if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nI recently watched The Shawshank Redemption (1994) again; I haven't seen it since the mid 90s when it released. It has held up well, and I liked it better than the last time I saw it. The pacing is superb, the ambience has just the right amount of gray, and the story is suitably affecting. This time around, I discovered that it's a much more nuanced film than I once thought it was. I'll just talk about two related points to illustrate this.\n\nFirst, the happy ending with Red finding Andy on the beach always bothered me. It didn't seem in keeping with the rest of the film's dingy esthetics. But this time through, I noticed that just before the shot of Andy driving his convertible down the coast of Mexico, Red says, \"When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it makes me laugh all over again.\" This isn't really Andy driving... it's Red imagining Andy driving. I infer then that the final scene of them on the beach is also Red's imagination. Hold this thought while I discuss a second point.\n\nThere's a pair of scenes that indicate how Red will meet any attempt to change him with quiet resistance. They're out in the yard playing checkers, and Andy comments that Chess is a better game. After Red suggests that it's a mystery, Andy offers to teach him how to play. The subject of them playing games is dropped for quite some time, then in a subsequent scene, after an interval of 10-20 years, they are again playing checkers. There's no fanfare about this; it's a subtlety not often seen in Hollywood film. But it is very important.\n\nIf you didn't know, the \"redemption\" referred to in the title is that of Red (Morgan Freeman), not Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy never loses hope, and pushes patiently until he escapes. When Andy talks of Red's eventual release, Red just says, \"I'm an institutional man now.\" This refers to Brooks, the old guy who was the librarian and spent 50 years in the prison. They talked of Brooks as an \"institutional man\"; someone who had been there so long, the walls had come to be necessary in his life. He had no idea how to live once he got out, and killed himself. Red even explicitly warns Andy about hope and how it's just a hurtful thing.\n\nAfter Andy's escape, Red is finally paroled and goes through the same motions as Brooks did, working the same job and even living in the same apartment. The second checkers scene prepares us for him to take the same way out. But instead, he decides to go looking for Andy. That is the redemption.\n\nThe final scene being imagined and pristine is the best possible depiction of the redemption: it shows Red's newfound ability to imagine a better possible life for himself. Whether or not it really happens is completely irrelevant. He has regained hope, and that's what matters.",

        "text": "His last film, made 13 years after his penultimate feature, Once Upon a Time in America doesn't feel like the iconic Leone we know and love. For the most part, he is known for the Dollar's Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West, which by themselves are also very good to even great. But after watching his last film just a few days ago, I feel this might be his best.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America was his dream project; a Gangster epic based off the 1952 novel, 'The Hoods'. In brief, it is about David \"Noodles\" Aaronson, a former member of a Jewish Ghetto gang in New York City, who after 35 years of being away, comes back and reminisces about the good 'ol days.\n\nThe film doesn't really feel like any of the classic Gangster flicks; not like The Godfather, not like Goodfellas. Instead, Once Upon a Time in America is nostalgic and reminiscent. It doesn't care much about the blood and glory of being a Gangster; rather, it cares about the characters and the bittersweet memories they have. With its narrative structure of inter-cutting between Noodles during the golden age and Noodles 35 years later, everything set during that golden age is looked upon as a fond memory, or bittersweet nostalgia. And really, throughout the depicted Golden Age, even in their acts of misdeed, you can't help but feel nostalgic, as Noodles is.\n\nThe sentiment is also brought forward by Ennio Morricone's great score. Arguably, this is Morricone's best score. Also unlike any score he composed for a Leone film, his score here reinforces the nostalgic sentiment. Instead of the harsh tone that The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly uses, the score is soft-spoken and light in tone. The result is nothing but masterful. And while we're on the topic of music in the film, the theme to Yesterday by the Beatles is used fantastically. Used twice in the film, its appearance is like the cherry on top of it all.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America is just overall a very well made film. It is very thematic, a good trait. Anyway, to sum it up, the film is very good and if you're interested in watching it I'd highly recommend it; it is a long watch, 3hrs 49 minutes to be precise, but it's really worth it. I'd love to discuss with you all what your opinions on the film are, whether it be the film itself, how it is compared to the rest of his filmography, or if you just want to talk about Leone in general, please feel free to discuss!\n\nEDIT: Accidentally said the film was 2hrs 29min instead of 229 minutes, my bad.",

        "author": "Carlito148",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8g2tte/character_theme_analysis_of_willem_dafoes/",
        "text": "Video Essay found here: https://youtu.be/huMldkp1ihE\n\nFull Write-Up Below:\n\nThe Florida Project is such an emotionally riveting film that contains layers upon layers of depth among its story and characters. It’s such an important film that explores the life of children that live in a deeply impoverished area that is ironically located a few miles away from whats proported to be the happiest magical place in the world, Disney Land. Now there are plenty of analytical pieces that already exist on the internet that analyze this film in different areas. But I couldn’t find anybody that attempted to dive into the character substance of Willem Dafoes character. I believe this is partly due to the fact of how the writer and director Sean Baker decided to approach the nuances of his character. On the surface, his character doesn’t seem nearly as integral  as the role of the mother and the little girl. But his character arguably conveys one of the deeper themes of the film that revolves around moral responsibility. It’s the fact that Sean Baker approached it in such an incredibly subtle way, that I feel a lot of people aren’t realizing how much depth that his character actually contains. So I'm really only going to concentrate on the subtle yet vast importance of Willem Dafoes character in the film and how it contributes to central theme of the film.\n\n So for starters, Willem Dafoe plays a character named Bobby and plays the role of a manager of a low end hotel that houses the main characters of the film which is a mother played by Bria Vanette and Brooklyn Prince (who by the way were absolutely phenomenal in the film and IM still pretty salty about them being snubbed of Oscar nominations) But anyway, yea Bobbys first introductory scene is actually crucially important as far as establishing his character. His first scene where he has to turn the power of the hotel back on due to the mischievous actions of Monee, We see that he is very involved with the tenants of the Hotel. We can tell from this very first introductory scene, that he takes pride in what he does and truly does care about the well-being of the tenants that pay to live there. The way that the camera follows him in this fairly long tracking shot as it ponts up at him from a low position, really illustrates Bobbys sense of power and accomplishment that he feels during this scene. He feels a true sense of reward and joy when he does something as simple as pulling a lever that turns all the power back on. This element of his character becomes very important to his character theme and the film in general. This will come full circle by the end of this analysis but let me go ahead and begin to really dissect and unpack his character.\n\n The first glimpse we get into Bobbys personal life is when his son comes into the picture early in the film. We get a scene of his son helping him throw out a mattress in a vacant room. On first viewing, this scene doesn’t really seem all that insightful  or telling. But upon second viewing, you realize how telling this scene actually is. His son looks very well kept in terms of how hes dressed and carries himself. And his son giving him a slight sense of passive aggressiveness when talking about his dads choice of color and the amount of money hes invested into it.  His son also becomes repulsed once he discovers how filthy and infested the mattress is while Bobby on the other hand is completely casual about it.  His son complains that Bobby should’ve warned him about Bed Bugs so he could’ve brought some gloves. All of these notions are subtle indications that his son is currently in a separate path of life than his father that is more than likely higher in class.. It shows us that he isn’t doing this as real form of work. Instead he is just doing his dad favors out of the goodness of his heart. These notions also become more obviously conveyed to us from a dialogue exchange we get between them later on. Its this crucial scene where  Bobbys son is helping him transport a fridge somewhere that really shows us that there is some genuine, honest tension between Bobby and his family.  Bobby took massive offense when his son revealed that he told his mom that Bobby wished her a happy birthday without his consent. So much so that he demanded that his son call his wife back and tell her that he didn’t. So why is there so much disconnect and what is the purpose of this? Its easy to just stop here and claim that this is just a simple attempt at giving Willem Dafoes character some depth. He has some serious family issues that hes struggling with as hes trying to run a rundown motel and that’s where it stays. No need for analysis. But I truly believe that this element of Bobbys character goes way deeper than that. But before I can really hammer this point home, Ive gotta dive a tad bit more into his character. \n\nSo Lets just dive into another crucial moment for Bobby. The scene begins where we see a bunch of children from the hotel innocently playing around the picnic tables without any kind of adult supervision. We eventually see an old weirdo creep up and try to interact with the kids which on its own conveys a harsh reality that kids have to experience in impoverished areas. Bad parents in bad areas will unfortunately yield horrible outcomes. Bobby notices the man from afar as he’s painting the hotel.  He’s so concerned about the creep that he lets the entire bucket of paint accidentally fall and splatter everywhere on the concrete below. But you can tell hes really not all that concerned about it. Even though a bucket of nice paint aint cheap, his full concern is still locked in on whats happening across the parking lot where the children are playing. Once Bobby confronts the man and asks him what his business here is, he immediately gets flustered and gives the sad excuse about he was “looking for a soda machine”. We then get an impressively long tracking shot where Bobby insists that he leads the creep towards the soda machine. Not only do we see the man acting in a disturbingly dishonest way but Bobby also forces a conversation about beverage choices that I found quite compelling. *insert clip* I believe the significance of him engaging in this dialogue is to draw a metaphorical parallel regarding the creeps despicable thirst for innocent children. When Bobby says “you know they say soda isn’t good for you. But you know whats better for you? Tea!” he is passive aggressively telling the creep to stay away from children and to only pursue relations with adults. Soda is usually symbolized as the junk food beverage that children and child-like people drink, While Tea on the other hand is symbolized as the more sophisticated and mature beverage choice. They finally reach the soda machine and the old creep almost leaves without even caring to take a sip. So Bobby forces him to take a sip but once he does, he smacks it out of his hand and begins to aggressively chase and shove him off the premises. He manages to snag his wallet and reads out his name and address which is apparently well out of state in New Jersey (which is another harsh reality. Children in poor areas go silently missing all the time and most of the time, they are never found. And this mostly due to the fact that these impoverished places are targeted by pedophiles who live on the other side of the country, because they know that there is a lack of supervision and is more untraceable that way) So by the end of the scene, Bobby states that he better escape the area because he’s going to report him to the sherrifs office. The reason why this scene is so crucially important, is because it conveys some important things about Bobbys character. This scene alone proves that Bobby is going well out of his way to ensure that the children are safe at his hotel. And the thing is, he doesn’t have to do that at all. That’s far past his job description. He is a hotel manager whos duties only involve maintenance and enforcing rules and pay dates. Im sure there are others duties that go with being a hotel manager, but I ensure that being a guardian angel to these children is not one of them. Throughout this entire film, we see Bobby always doing what he can to keep monees mother out of trouble and giver her tons of slack on different things. This is all crucially important because it shows that Bobby feels that he has a moral responsibility to do whatever he can to ensure that the children living in his hotel are in more or less good hands. Because is well aware that the vast majority of these children either have subpar or absolutely horrible parents that refuse to step up and act like the responsible parent that they should be. He has an understanding of the evils that can possibly occur and have occurred in low end hotels like his. \n\nSo with all of this context in mind, lets get back to that question of whats causing tension between Bobby and his family. To me, this is precisely it. Bobby has an occupation that would be considered to be on the lower end of the societal class spectrum. I believe what caused Bobby and his family to disconnect . has to do with his belief In his own moral obligation. Remember in the earlier scene where his son is helping him out with a mattress? The way that his son is disgusted by the mattress and his father casual attitude about it, shows that his son as been accustomed to a different upper class lifestyle for quite some time. So what I believe happened, is that when Bobby and his family were still together, they must’ve hit a point in their life where they all had the opportunity to move up  on the social scale and leave the violent impoverished environment behind them. But, Bobby refused to do so because again, he feels as if he as a neccesaary moral obligation to look after these children and attempts to ensure that nothing horribly tragic happens under his watch. So naturally, this is going to cause a giant disconnect in their relationship because it has to do with an important decision that will determine the security, quality, and opportunities for the remainder of their lives. So I believe that this what caused the divorce between Bobby and his wife which naturally causes him to be disconnected to his son as well. Bobby is still bitter towards his wife for not understanding his point of view and completely abandoning him for it. And his wife probably feels bitter towards Bobby for not letting go of the impoverished lifestyle and wasting his entire life on children that aren’t his. Understanding this somewhat hidden context of his character really enhances simpler scenes in the film. Like the scene where Bobby leaning over the railing and looking out over his hotel as hes smoking a cigarette… its as if hes reflecting on some  important life choices that hes made that still has him rooted to where he currently is…\n\nWell alright guys that’s my quick analysis on Willem Dafoes character in the Florida Project. I hope that this was able to provide something new that you may not have caught when watching this film. I’m not 100% certain that this is a full proof interpretation but sometimes that can be the beauty of film as an art form. I think the Florida Project is one of the best films to come out in 2017 and it’s a shame that it did not get the recognition it deserved at the Academy Awards.",

        "text": "So I just watched Brokeback Mountain for the first time last night and...woah! I always assumed this was that \"gay cowboy movie\" because it often has jokes told about it. I figured it was pretty good because it got really good reviews but I didn't expect it to be THAT good. It was GOOD. I mean, it wasn't the best movie ever made and it wasn't anything extravagant but it was simply beautiful. It's so much more then just that gay cowboy movie. It's a wonderful story and I don't know why more film critics talk about it more. \n\nFirst off, the acting is perfect. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are fantastic in their roles. They play the characters so naturally, that the acting kind of went over my head because it was so realistic and the characters seemed so real. Thinking that these are only fiction characters and the story is made up, seems impossible to me. The story was obviously a great one and an important one, too. I mean this movie came out in 2005 and I can't imagine what the reaction to it was. Especially with such big name actors in it. But, the best part about it was that it didn't treat it like some gay film or how it was helpful to the LGBT community at the time. It was simply a love story, the gender, while it did play a role, wasn't the focus of the story. The story was executed perfectly and the pacing was AMAZING. Really, for a 2 hour movie, lots of people can get tired or bored but it kept me interested the entire time. I didn't want to look away from the screen. \n\nThe best part about this film is the emotional weight of it. I did tear up a little at the end, but I didn't feel a crazy rush of emotion when watching it. But, when I turned the movie off and turned to go to bed, I found that I couldn't even fall asleep or get comfortable. I couldn't stop thinking about Jack and Ennis and how unfair the story was. I'm still thinking about it and I'm still heartbroken. It's a weird kind of sadness, too. It's different than one any film has ever given me. My body feels heavy and weighted, I feel somber and lost. It's strange but it's really so great. Some how this film found a way to have that affect and from what I've heard, I'm not the only one who felt like this after watching it. I scrolled all the way through the IMDB user reviews and couldn't find anything lower than an 8/10. Everyone can enjoy this movie, no matter if you're straight or gay and no matter where you come from. \n\nI wish more people would talk about this in video essays or on forums like this. It's a masterpiece and has such an unreal, unbelievable emotional affect on the audience. I don't know how the filmmakers achieved this feeling but it's very really. I can't stop thinking about this movie. I will definitely be checking out Ang Lee's other works. That's all. I just wanted to express how beautiful this movie is. ",

        "text": "Call me a contrarian, but it fell slightly above mediocre for me. I think the two strongest parts of the film were the performances and the voice. Everyone was great in the film, they were a lot of fun to watch. It also had a unique and thoughtful message that gave me something to chew on after the movie ended.\n\nOn to the things that brought it down for me. I thought that the visual presentation was bland and uninteresting. The cinematography was flat without adding to the tone of the movie (whereas something like La Promesse lacks flashy cinematography, but it makes the world feel grittier and more real). In fact- the boring composition took  me out of it quite a bit. Also, the lighting, in my opinion, constantly looked overdone without being stylish. A lot of it looked like a TV show. My only exception to his is the \"sinking through the floor\" scenes, which I thought were pretty creative.\n\nI thought the movie was simultaneously predictable and not predictable at all. The plot was entertaining and bonkers, but the beats were all expected to me.  The parents and guests are evil- got it, but I don't think that was meant to be a huge surprise- the girlfriend is evil- it was obvious to me at least- everybody is killed off one by one by Chris- yup- Rod comes to the rescue- also a yup. I'm not saying that a movie has to be off the rails to be enjoyable, but every beat in Get Out just felt boring.\n\nAnd the last point I'll make- it didn't emotionally grab me. This is the most objective point. I just didn't get into it. Film is pure emotion and connection. When I feel no connection or emotion towards a film, I lose interest. It just didn't grab me. I bring this up because I see a lot of people on this sub arguing that \"everything was well done, but I just didn't enjoy it\" is an invalid answer. I don't think it's a lack understanding, I think it's a lack of connection. This isn't up to the viewer, it's up to whatever weird ass force controls our emotions\n\nThat's just my opinion. I know that a lot of people on this sub love Get Out, but I just disagree.",

        "text": "So not too long ago there was a post by a user who, in short, called out the sub for being “toxic” because of the perceived gatekeeping he received in response to the negative comments that plagued his post about the new Avengers movie. The user spoke of their disappointment that r/TrueFilm users weren’t taking his discussion seriously and that rather than engaging in a polite discourse over his presented talking points, people were instead deriding him for bringing up a Marvel movie for discussion in r/TrueFilm.\n\nCall it gatekeeping or toxicity or whatever you like, the fact remains that r/TrueFilm aims at a standard. In terms of subreddits it seems apparent the different ones concerning movies exist for a reason: r/movies aims at general movie discussion, being all inclusive and  traditional accepting in their definition of “movie.” Then r/flicks also exist for perhaps more niche, less mainstream films that happen to demand more serious discussion than perhaps could be hoped for on r/movies. Thusly, r/TrueFilm seems to be the place for what is deemed “film” not in the classic sense of movies shot traditionally on film, but for those movies that seem more concerned with the actual art of film. Those that bear an artistic merit that can be perceived by virtue of the artistic devices employed on the screen. The considerations taken when looking at the different aspects: the casting, cinematography, editing, narrative. Those films that really seem to exist as nothing else but “films.” Hence the “true” in r/TrueFilm.\n\nIt would seem the point of confusion comes in considering the artistic merit of these films and differentiating them from the art of the Blockbuster style Marvel movies. One of the major distinctions I can think of is that Marvel movies aren’t characteristically concerned with the art of film. The Marvel films are vehicles of spectacle concerned foremost with profit. This is not an inherently bad thing and is a natural consequence of the evolution of film in a consumerist society. The idea that we can take provenly profitable characters and pay for the technology to make their otherwise fantastical stories and elements seem believable enough for an audience to be visually stimulated and emotionally engaged is not new or unique to the Marvel movies. In fact the decline of these sorts of movies is part of what led to New Hollywood or the American New Wave, which led to the rise of Scorsese, Coppola, Kubrick, Malick, Polanski and others. These types of movies, however, are necessary as a sort of baseline entertainment, a sort of distraction from the boring everyday-ness of everyday life. But they’re not true films. \n\nr/TrueFilm isn’t just the subreddit that takes cinema discussion more seriously than other related subreddits, it’s the place where cinema is so central, there’s is no space for anything that isn’t deemed to be truly film. Avengers and Marvel and other franchise movies are movies, they’re a big deal while they’re here but soon enough they’ll be gone, just a fad. No one is saying you can’t express your enthusiasm over these movies. You’re certainly within rights to, but in terms of keeping a standard, this sub isn’t the place to do it.\n\nNow for the sake of discussion I implore all of you to think of other reasons why Marvel and similar Blockbuster style movies should be kept from point of discussion in r/TrueFilm. What do you all think? Why do you believe that theres such a backlash against posting about Marvel movies?",

It's a pretty obscure movie from what I can tell, but it's been one of my favorites ever since I was a kid. As I've gotten older I realize that it presents a very pro-environment agenda and doesn't really try to hide it, but I also think that it does it in a way so as not to be offensive. It focuses on the man-nature relationship from three different perspectives: Tyler is a lowly government employee who's hardly spent a day in the woods, Rosie is a rough-around-the-edges bush pilot looking to make a profit on the undisturbed wilderness, and Ootek/Mike have spent basically their whole lives living in harmony with the Arctic wildlife.\n\nThe minimal cast and dialogue lend themselves to creating a very interesting atmosphere of isolation and intimacy, and Charles Martin Smith is fantastic is his portrayal of the lonely Tyler, who is forced to adapt to the harsh Arctic winter both physically and mentally. Despite leaning on text exposition in the very beginning of the film, the intro always draws me in with its haunting score and beautiful shots of the tundra. This engaging atmosphere persists through the entire movie, with a few more lighthearted comical interactions well-placed throughout. \n\nIf you've seen it, what are your thoughts? Liked or disliked it? If you haven't, I definitely recommend it as well as its book counterpart. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8fvr4j/dunkirk_the_failure_of_visual_storytelling/",
        "text": "I have just finished the final instalment in a three-part video series on the failure of the visual storytelling in Christopher Nolan’s *Dunkirk* (2017). You can watch the first episode following this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cam0RfA1A7Y&amp;t=450s \n\nThe basic argument in is, as anyone who has ever leaned into the criticism on Nolan will know (or basically just watched one of his films critically), that he really cannot direction action well at all. By action, I mean all action on screen. It is most obvious in his set-pieces, but it is also a problem in his coverage and the movement of actors. Normally, owing to the reliance on dialogue or the inconsequence of his actions scenes (a lot of them are really narratively superfluous) this basic failure of film grammar and visual storytelling can be overlooked. But in Dunkirk, which strips away dialogue and leans heavily on physical action, these deficiencies become extraordinarily apparent. \n\nI have many other problems with *Dunkirk* which I was unable to discuss in the video, as they lay outside the remit of the topic, which if I could beg your indulgence, I’ll outline some of here: \n\n• The film is fair too reliant on Hans Zimmer’s score. The integral use of both a literal ticking clock and the Shepard tone (an aural illusion that means a rising scale will never resolve and just appear to rise continually) is both heavy-handed and manipulative, and that is where the tension is coming from. There is nothing wrong with a score telling the audience how to feel, but here the score is doing all the work, and it really works to cover the flaws in the filmmaking. \n• Related to this is the sound design, which I don’t think is a bad example of sound design – though it is unbearably loud – but it is used to stitch together or paste over the bad filmmaking. This is something I noticed in the car chase in *The Dark Knight* (mentioned in the video): the crunching and scraping of metallic scores resembles what we assume we’d hear when a vehicle crashes, so we overlay that onto the images, the logic of which don’t make sense, and let the sound do the work. This happens all the time during Dunkirk.  We privilege the sound allowing the visuals a free pass to fail. \n• The narrative structure creates a false and unearned sense of suspense and anticipation. By splitting the narrative into three temporally distinct strands at the beginning, it implies that they will converge by the end – which is fine, but this idea gives an undue sense of the narrative being a ‘race against time’, which of course it isn’t. The Germans (sorry, the enemy) are absent from the film and all attacks are presented as being random, so there is no deadline by which the British to get off the beach. The arrival of the Sunday sailors is presented as the dramatic climax, but there is no imperative for them to arrive at a certain time – the situation on the beach would have continued as is until these boats did arrive (or until all the soldiers were killed, whichever). So the three narrative strands, with their distinct times, gives the impression that this situation is a ticking time bomb, when in fact it isn’t. It’s a manipulate narrative conceit designed to create dramatic tension in a story where that type of drama isn’t inherent. \n\nI’d fascinated to know what other people think. I know that *Dunkirk* was one of the best reviewed films of last year, and that I’m in the minority opinion here, but I’d like to know how people respond to the issues I’ve raised, either in the videos or here (particularly the point about the structure). \n\nAm I missing something, or am I just being too critical? \n   \n\n",

There are two ideas I've been thinking about while writing about this film that I'd like to see what other people think.\n\n1. Are the works of Jean-Luc Godard comedic (or, if not comedic, at least playful)? I feel like anytime I see Godard discussed, it's as if he's this pretentious art-house type - but I've always read a comedic undertone in nearly all of his films (and I've watched about 20). Most of the time, it's not from the narrative, but rather the technical elements. What's unique about his form of comedy is simply how embedded it is in subtler elements - which might be why it gets overlooked. I guess I view him as a subtler Edgar Wright. Am I the only one who reads his films this way?\n\n2. How important is set design for genre films? Alphaville is intentionally stripped down, with a lot of its genre elements merely being implied. Should a film try to capture the image as best it can - and if so, does that leave genre films largely controlled by major studios who can afford costly sets and effects? What I think this boils down to is, how much can a film leave to our imaginations before we stop buying into it (a more popular film that presents this question is Dogville), and are we wrong to have these expectations if they largely benefit Hollywood over independent studios?",

        "text": "Hello people of TrueFilm,\n\nI've been a Sub to this place for over 4 years now. Search author:henrythebrown and I've put a handful of posts up here as well. I've loved this subreddit, one of the few places I've stayed loyal to, a place where people can actually come together and have thoughtful engaging discussions on films.\n\nOnly, I've slowly come to the conclusion that that might not be so true. The other day I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8fc9g3/avengers_infinity_war_character_arcs_and_their/), and got some aggressive responses in return. It seems some people in this subreddit believe it's below them to discuss a Marvel film.\n\nNow, say what you want about the ideas I expressed in the post, fair enough if they're not as insightful as other people, but I do make an effort to bring the discussion to others, specifically asking people of this Subreddit for their opinions.\n\nI wanted to breed discussion and hear different sides of the story; read about how people loved it and how the film functioned or hated it and tore it apart. But instead, a few \"True\"Filmers tore into me instead, many of which (not surprisingly) hadn't even seen this film. And yes, I understand, it's the internet, there will always be people like this, but I'm not just talking about my post, I see this happen A LOT. (heck, I've even caught myself doing this in the past, and I felt pretty bad about it)\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I know where they come from. I used to be this way a few years ago. I felt because I put effort into finding \"out there\" films, and watching the more unconventional that my efforts should be rewarded, that I was above watching \"popular\" films, that my taste was better because of this. This was a toxic indulgent opinion that stopped me enjoying films and engaging in any discussions with my friends, and in the end I was realised that the films I grew up on, the films I started watching in the first place where sometimes the best films of all.\n \nEvery film is worth discussion, for it's good merits or it's bad. TrueFilm film shouldn't just encompass talking about unknown films or the avant garde, it's about discussing films in greater details and analysing the elements and history behind cinema that makes the films we love (or hate) come together. Forget Highbrow, forget Lowbrow, just discuss films for what they are.\n\nI love Lars Von Tries, I love David Lynch, I love Kubrikc, I love Harmony Korine, I love Yorgos Lanthimos, I love Paul Thomas Anderson, I love Hitchcock!\n\nI also love Nolan, Tarantino, Edgar Wright, Wes Anderson, Spielberg, Phil Lord and Chris Miller!\n\n(not that I'm arguing we need more diverse taste, anyone can like anything, that's what gives us our individual views which makes this place so fascinating. I'm just showing I love any film, and I would love to see an acceptance of diversity in the posts here instead of this toxic one-upping) \n\nThe biggest problem with this Subreddit is the misunderstanding of discussion... ITS NOT A COMPETITION! Its a process where we hear each others ideas and sides and open up to grow together. None of us \"know better\", none of us our \"superior\", we're all the same level, different people discussing what we love most: **films** \n\n\nNow, in the spirit of this post: Lets discuss this. \n\nWhat do the people of TrueFilm think? Do you feel you get the same reaction from people? If you're one of these people who responds like this, why do you feel like discussing films in this fashion (honest question, do you think it creates good dialogue on films)? Maybe I'm over reacting, if so: why do you think this is a good space to discuss films?\n\nLook forward to reading your replies :) \n\n\nEDIT: A few corrections, and the addition of the paragraph entirely in brackets\n\nEDIT 2: What a brilliant response, this engagement and level of discussion is golden! Reading over some points, I agree me listing directors names off was kind of a shield thing, and I see how some people want this place as an escape from pop culture, but goodness, I’m looking through all the replies and this is what I personally would want from a thread. There’s no toxicity, just discussion! ",

        "author": "Carlito148",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8fum3m/annihilation_explained_character_theme_and_story/",
        "text": "The videos traction has slowed down quite significantly for the past few months so I was hoping to trigger a thought provoking discussion regarding Annihilation. If you're interested in the video analysis, you can find it here: https://youtu.be/d_xoZVw-Sz0\n\nBut here's my full lengthy write up:\n\n. Like the Director Alex Garlands previous film Ex Machina, it explores philosophical themes regarding Humanity, Morality, Identity, Nature, and evolution in a visually stunning way. In my spoiler free review, which you can find at the end link of this video or in the descpriton box below, I described Annihilation as ambiguous, in the sense that there are a lot of gray areas regarding the deeper aspects and themes of the film. But I’ve come to find out that there are actually a lot of people who have been saying the opposite of that. Saying that this film explains and spoonfeeds everthing to the audience without allowing them to figure it out for themselves. Of course I highly disagree with that. I’ll agree that the film can yes sometimes get exposition heavy in terms of explaining how the shimmer ultimately operates and what not. But the film leaves other more substantive aspects up to visual and verbal inferences. Like what pushed both Kane and Lina to voluntarily go into the shimmer. What caused both Lina and Kane to survive further than the rest of their crew, Why did the extraterrestrial  absorb human dna and create duplicates, What did the extraterrestrial want? Some of these things might be a little more obvious than others but, these are some of the things that I believe the film demanded you to more or less think critically think about.  These are some loaded questions So I will probably naturally end up answering other questions that you may have regarding the film. \n\nLets just begin with discussing Natalie Portmas character Lina. She served in the army for 7 years and became a professor in biology, specifically in cellular life cycles and reproduction. There are some parallels drawn from this aspect of her character and study that I’ll come back to later. So Later we see Lina mourning over her husband Kane so we assume that he must’ve died in the line of duty somewhere. The film seems pretty simple to follow at this point, but the film throws you its first curveball when we see a confused, depressed, disoriented version of her husband show up at her house. In the third act of the film, it is revealed that this is a duplicate version of her husband created by the extraterrestrial being that lives in the heart of the shimmer. And one neat thing to point out, is that the film visually hints at this when the camera focuses on their hands through the glass of water on the table. It’s conveying a scrambled refracted image which is precisely what the shimmer does. It refracts and scrambles all the DNA that dwells inside it. The films also multiple different shots of the glass of water as well. Just thought thatd be neat to point out. But ok. So eventually the duplicated alien version of Kane starts to puke up blood and experience massive organ failure and this is what bridges Lina to  military center where Jennifer Jason Leighs character revelas information about Kanes mission and the possible apocalyptic crisis brought on by the massive Shimmer that continues to spread and consume everything in its path. So before I dive into all that, I want to stay on track with Natalie Portmans character Lina. One reoccurring critique of the film that I’ve from other movie critics including bigger youtubers like Chris Stuckmann, is that the backstory involving Lina having an affair was a forceful and unnecessary attempt at giving more depth to Portmans character. But I honestly think it’s a vastly important detail for the story, theme and characters. So in terms of theme, Linas infedlity relates back to the conversation she had with Jennifers character regarding the human tendancy to self destruct. She talks about how we all have a natural unstoppable yearning to self destruct when things become too nice and orderly.  So Linas infidelity is her current self destruction that she feels incredibly remorseful for. And we also come to learn that her husband Literally self destructs himself with a flash grenade and we also learn that Lina destructs the alien duplicate of herself which technically is another literal form of self destruction. I just think its creatively intresting that this film was able to convey self destruction both literally and metaphorically. But okay, so the affair contributes to the theme of self destruction but it also adds more substance to the story and characters. The scene where we see a flashback of Kane by Linas bedside before he goes on the mission, was supposed to convey Kanes awareness of Linas affair. He mentions that they made him leave a day early despite them having plans for the day. He has a very cold stare as he’s talking to her and says that he does love her. But as she tries to kiss him, he turns his cheek and leaves. This is an incredibly strong indicator that he knows about her affair. He probably didn’t really have to leave a day early but once he found out about her affair, he just said screw the plans that I had with her today, I’m just gonna go straight into the shit.  and Lina is aware of this because in later flashback where we see her in the act of cheating, she treats the professor harshly and admits that she believes Kane knows everything. The professor says she hates herself more than she hates him, Which is at least partially true. She responds with “Nah its you to” and kicks him out and ultimately puts an end to the affair. The notion of her hating herself will be useful later in this analysis. So when she learns that the Alien Kane, who she thinks is the real Kane, went into the shimmer and is now on death row, she feels that she has a moral obligation to go into the shimmer due to her self destructive infidelity that may or may not have pushed him to also go into the shimmer and risk his life.\nSo another aspect of this film that some people might have questions about is what exactly determined each characters survival time. Its clear in the film that some people were being consumed by the shimmer faster than others. Why is that? I’ve discussed this subject with different people and the most what ended up making more sense to me, is that it has to do with ones mentality and mental state. It seems to me that those who were more frightended of death and held a possible hope that they might come back out of the shimmer, were the ones that got consumed by the shimmer. The one that started getting consumed by the shimmer first was Thorensons character. It’s revealed that shes newly sober and had a dark past with drug addiction. Most people get addicted to drugs because they are being used as a stress reliever that helps them cope with the harsh realities of their life. So by definition, She is not someone who is used to handling stressful situations in a constructive way.  She is not someone who has honestly accepted and embraced the harsh realities of life. So naturally, she’s gonna be the first to be consumed by the shimmer due to her weak mental state. Lina and Dr. Ventress (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) were the two characters that lasted the longest because they were fully mentally prepared for what they rightfully assumed to be inevitable death.  Dr. Ventress had cancer and was already on death row. So naturally, death is not going to phase her while expoloring the shimmer. Sheppard shared a similar mentality but she was just unfortunately mauled and eaten by a mutated bear, crazy how nature do that. Josie is kind of the opposite. It’s mentioned that she cuts herself, but not with intended suicide in her mind. She does it to feel more alive. So I don’t think its much of a stretch to say that her life may have been a little too sheltered and she needed to add a little pain in order to fill in that void. And I believe she had that same intention going into the shimmer but she got more than what she bargained for to say the least.. plus she was by far the youngest of them all and probably hasn’t come to terms with death due to hear age and inexperience..  So lets talk about Lina.  I have heard other channels like What The Flick state that Lina was actually expecting to come back. And I don’t understand why they think that is. To me, Lina was definitely not expecting to return and was definitely mentally preparing herself for death. Heres what Lina knew before going into the shimmer, She knew that her husband Kane was experiencing organ failure and was on death row. She also knew that people have been going to the shimmer for three years and nobody has come out alive, and the only one who has come back, is basically a vegetable waiting to die. She also has gigantic remorse for cheating on her husband and felt responsible for her husbands soon to be death. The film also demonstrates her character as a very down to earth person who has a naturalistic view on life. So with all of this context put into consideration, I think it makes more sense to say that she was not expecting to return from the Shimmer. She didn’t enter the shimmer with any real hope that she will be able to save her husbands life. She went into the shimmer for own personal moral redemption and out of her own curiosity. Her husband Kane went into the shimmer after experiencing intense heartbreak,  knowing that the love of his life had been cheating on him throughout their marriage. So one can assume that kane went into the Shimmer with a fairly pessimistic outlook and was probably not all that afraid of death . Which is most likely why he was able to survive the longest amongst his crew. One thing to note though is that Kane doesent hate himself in the same way that Lina does. This will be useful soon. \nOkay now its time to get into what the hell was going on in third act. So eventually, Lina makes it to the lighthouse where the source of the shimmer lies. And she discovers  a videotape of Kane committing suicide through self destruction with a flash grenade as he is talking to his alien duplicate about his current identity struggle and mental state. She wanders into the dark hole where the crater crash landed and finds Dr. Ventress who we can assume is a duplicate due to her face being blurred as she is speaking. She mentions that shes not sure what it wants or if it wants.  And then she the extraterrestrial begins to purge itself of Ventress’s body and the alien begins to seduce Lina closer to it through its hypnotic sounds and imagery. And btw the visuals, score and sound effects from this point on is absolutely mesmerizing. It really does an incredible job at sucking you into what the main character is experiencing. So the being is able to consume a drop of her blood and it forms a humanoid duplicate of her. Her alien duplicate begins to mimc her exact movements which results in Lina getting knocked unconscious twice. On her third attempt at escaping, she tricks the alien being by pretending to let it in close by holding its hand. And as their hands softly connect, you can see Linas face appear on her duplicate. This to me, is an indicator that in order for the duplicate to really embody you, you have to let it get emotionally close to you, kind of like a form of nurturement. This is significant because we have observed that Kanes duplicate appears to have embody his appearance pretty well. Which means that Kane voluntarily nurtured the being in order for it to appear that way. This is where the subject of “hating yourself” comes useful in my opinion. Kane thinks much more highly of himself than Lina does . He does not hate himself which is probably why he couldn’t bring him self to kill the duplicate. He allowed the duplicate to get so close that he lost his identity and couldn’t figure out which one was the duplicate. So he ultimately chose to destroy his current consciousness because he didn’t have what it takes to look at his own face and destroy it. Lina on the other hand, had no problem looking at her duplicate straight in the face and tricking it by placing a grenade in its hand as she runs away for cover.  This is again because she does not think highly of herself and does hate herself for being naturally self destructive. So her duplicate is in flames as it stumbles around and sets the entire place on fire which again, is a huge literal representation of self destruction.  The entire shimmer turns into ashes and it cuts to Nina being asked about what the being was, what was its biological composition, and what was its purpose. She replies idk to most of it but when asked what it wants, she gives the same response as Ventress and says “I don’t think it wants anything”.\nOkay so here are the big questions, what was the beings purpose? Why does it duplicate? And why does it mimic? So as far as the beings purpose, this answer might be a little underwhelming for some people but, it doesn’t have a purpose. The extraterrestrial landed on earth out of pure chance and if you’re asking for what its purpose was, it’s the same purpose that we all share, which is to survive. The extraterrertial being represents the chaotic, random nature of the universe and nature itself. Everybody wants their to be some sort of objective meaning because its comforting but the truth is that there is none. All the alien wanted to do was to survive and we as humans naturally want answers as to why its destroying our people and ecosystems because we automatically consider anything that gets in the way of our well being and survival as evil. And to me, this is why it duplicates people. It figured that if it wants to survive on this planet, all it has to do is make copies of what is already surviving and thriving on this planet. Its creating something new but also the same at the same time. But why was it mimicking Linas exact movements? Well, think of the duplicate as a new life form that has just been born. It’s a brand new life form or child if you will, that is copying the parents movements. This is what every new form of complex life. They mimic their parents and nurturers behaviors in order to learn and survive. The entire concept of duplication and creating pairs also goes back to the subject demonstrated in the film about the reproduction and life cycles of cells. Life began with the duplication of a singular cell so I believe the film is drawing a parallel with that and the extraterrestrial being.  One could also draw a parallel from the duplicate pairs and how its analogous to relationships and couples. Life can noy continue to thrive if its on its own. If it wants its survival time to increase and live on, their must be a pair in order for that to happen. \nBut okay lets move on to some bonus questions, Why did Kane get better after the shimmer crumbled to ashes? Was the Lina shown at the end of the film the original Lina that went into the shimmer? And wtf is up with Linas Tattoo of a snake eating its own tail? Well to answer the first question, to be honest, I really don’t know for sure. But after giving it lots of thought, and what made the most sense to me, is that perhaps after the extraterrestrial was destroyed, the alien Dna inside of Kanes body stopped dividing and mutating which is probably why he was experiencing organ failure.  But once the source of the alien died, the alien DNA was able to relax and stop mutating the body and causing chaos that is disrupting his bodily functions. Idk if this is accurate but it’s a good discussion piece for the comment section. So please comment away with your interpretations because this is something I’m still pondering.  But was the LIna shown at the last shot of the film the real Lina? Some people have said that they believe that it is the alien Lina due to it focusing on he shimmery glare of her eye. But to me this too farfetched considering we literraly saw Lina set her duplicate on fire and we continue to see her alien duplicate perish in the flames. I believe that the Lina we see at the end of the film is the original Lina and the reason why the film focuses on her shimmery glare is to convey that the extraterrestrial DNA that she contracted from the shimmer is still well within her and that she came out of the shimmer a different person that she was before.  So lastely, what is the significance of the snake tattoo and where did it come from? We see a victim earlier in the film that looks like something straight out of John Carpetners The Thing, and we can also observe that he also had the same snake tattoo on his arm. So this could indicate two things. The tattoo is either the mark of the shimmer or she contracted it from someone else through refracted DNA. I’m leaning towards that it is the mark of the shimmer because it appeared on the exact part of her arm where  she had a bruise and discovered that the shimmers DNA was inside her. Now the metaphorical relevance is actually quite fascinating to me. The symbol of a snake eating its own tail has had different meanings throughout its history, but its relevance to the film has to do with infinite, identity, and self destruction. The snake eating itself is what resembles self destruction and I’ve already explained the thematic relevance of self destruction in the film. But to me it also represents identity and infinite.  Self destruction and chaos are necessary components for life to exist and emerge. I believe what the writer and director alex garland was going for is that chaos and self destruction is natural yearning that every human being again, without these components, life can not be possible. Self destruction and chaos comes first and order follows it as a natural consequence. I also believe it has a lot to say about Identity. The film is attempting to flip our convetional perspective regarding identity. For instance, the mutated bear that contracts Sheppards DNA… what is the identity of that bear? We can hear Sheppards morbidly disturbing screams come form the bear.. .so what is it? How do we define what that is? I believe its trying to say that Identity is more or less an illusion that we get too caught up with and we fail to realize that we are all one and are made up of DNA just like every life form on this planet. This also goes hand in hand with the concept of infinite. When we die, we don’t really die. The illusion of our identity might die.. but cells across the planet and universe are still thriving and dividing after we die.. therefore, we continue to live on forever. \n\nAlso one really interesting symbolic element of this film that I did not include in the video is that the tunnel that Lina explores in search of the extraterrestrial during the third act of the film, resembles vaginal walls. I thought this was interesting considering that the extraterrestrial was able to create new life within the heart of the shimmer (the uterus) as it traveled through the crater tunnel (the birth canal) and out into the natural world (the completion of the birthing process)\n",

        "author": "rkeaney",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8fu5ks/marlina_the_murderer_in_four_acts_is_a_stylish/",
        "text": "[Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW0qZgQfX8s)\n\nA modern day Sergio Leone western set against a backdrop of the mountainous Indonesian countryside, today I’m reviewing the stylish Marlina, The Murderer in Four Acts.\n\nMarlina The Murderer follows the eponymous Marlina, who, recently widowed, has to ward off a gang of intruders to her secluded rural home that arrive with intention of raping her and stealing her livestock. What the men don’t realise however is that Marlina has no intention of letting that happen. Upon murdering the leader of the gang, she sets out to report her incident to the police with his head as proof of her righteous vengeance.\n\nThe setting of the Indonesian countryside is strangely perfect for the western style and narrative tropes chosen to tell the film’s story. Stunningly shot vistas show off a beautiful yet desolate landscape where Marlina’s loneliness is compounded and her determination all the more strongly felt. The style and use of violence seem almost Tarantino like on the surface but the film has its very own unique cinematic language that along with its harsh realism, regularly dips into surreal and humorous asides. The film drips with atmosphere while maintaining a brisk 93 minute runtime, its minimalist plot allows us to linger evocatively on the stunning scenery and Marsha Timothy’s silently powerful central performance at its forefront whilst never dragging unduly. \n\nThe cinematography by Yunus Pasolang is absolutely stunning and works wonders in selling tone and the aforementioned intoxicating atmosphere. One shot in which Marlina washes herself in a beachside shower cubicle silhouetted by the setting sun is affectingly resonant within the progression of the story whilst also being beautifully rendered. The score by Yudhi Arfani and Zeke Khalesi is excellent and more than befitting of this Leone style showcasing the kind of power and alluring tones that Ennio Morricone always brought to those Spaghetti Westerns. Further reminiscent of the likes of Leone’s man with a harmonica, the film’s main antagonist even carries with him a traditional instrument with which he plucks out his own ominous theme tune that haunts Marlina throughout. \n\nMarsha Timothy is commanding in her portrayal of Marlina, a strong woman attempting to survive alone in this harsh landscape whilst mourning personal losses within her family that she can’t drive from her thoughts. The cast of characters ranging from despicable bandits to quirky country folk bring the location to life with Novi, played by Dea Panendra, a no nonsense pregnant friend of Marlina’s being the real standout in a strong supporting cast. Both of these women carry the themes of female empowerment and breaking free of the constraints set upon them by society with what seems like ease due to their charisma and powerful screen presence. The antagonistic Markus who arrives at Marlina’s mountaintop ranch in the film’s opening sequence, a villainous modern day outlaw riding a dirtbike instead of a horse is imposing and quietly menacing. The young men that set out to avenge his death, all the more unforgiving and brutal in their violent retributions when hunting down his killer, Marlina. Along with Novi’s uncaringly brash husband and the lethargic incompetence of the authorities these men represent a social order where women are seen as possessions, oppressed and utterly underestimated. In one scene young boys playing soccer are juxtaposed with a young girl who serves Marlina in a restaurant next door. Women are seen for their physical worth, what work they can do, how they can satisfy men. This notion is counteracted terrifically by the women at the story’s centre. These two women grapple with their inability to give birth, to satisfy their husbands, yet in the end this painful frustration makes them stronger, fiercer rivals to the men who terrorise them. Marlina the Murderer could certainly be accused of being somewhat simple plot wise but these keenly felt character arcs elevate it, making the film a well rounded and cathartic viewing experience. \n\nWriter/ Director Mouly Surya has achieved something quite poignant in her humanistic approach to Marlina the Murderer whilst incorporating the stylistic aspects of the western genre with aplomb. She creates suspense and dread with cinematic flair whilst making us care deeply for her characters. The director even humanises the antagonists, we empathise with them while we fear their intentions towards Marlina.\n\nMarlina The Murderer in Four Acts isn’t a perfect film but it’s an exciting, well acted and beautifully made one. \n\n\n\n[Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW0qZgQfX8s)",

Then he told me that a masterpiece needs to be \"more than a blockbuster\" and that a masterpiece is a movie like Blade Runner 2049, which has an excellent score, amazing cinematography, top-notch acting and an amazing script.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with the statement that a masterpiece needs to be more than a blockbuster. Movies like Die Hard, Jaws and A New Hope are all straightforward action films/blockbusters, but at regarded by many as masterpieces for numerous reasons. I also disagree that a masterpiece needs to have amazing soundtrack or top-notch acting. 12 Angry Men and Before Sunrise, for example, are two movies I would consider masterpieces, and neither have amazing soundtracks. Back to The Future is a movie I consider a near-masterpiece, and there is nothing \"top notch\" about the acting.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I have however become worried if watching large-scale 2.35:1 epics on a 22' monitor  damages my experience, and I'm sure that there is a negative effect as some prominent film directors such as Spielberg have stated over and over again. Nowadays I prefer watching content filmed for television as the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3.  \nI'm not looking for purchasing advice, I mainly want to research if there are negative sides to the home theater projectors I haven't taken into account yet. At a standard consumer price point a projector's entry price can be lower than a comparable TV's, and I might even get along without a silver/projection screen for a while by casting at my white wall.\n\n(The sound is out of the scope of this topic — purchasing a decent 7.1 surround setup requires so high monetary and temporal contribution that I will gladly postpone bringing audio to a high standard.)",

        "text": "I watched Ex Machina for the first time last night and it was good! I didn't think it was amazing but there was one thing I did love about it and that was the plot twist. The film builds you up to have sympathy for Ava and the rest of the AIs before her. We want Caleb to save her and we want them to build a connection. We also feel wary of Nathan from the very start. He seems suspicious and we're lead to believe he's the antagonist. This is even more cemented when Caleb finds the video footage of Nathan with all the previous AIs and how he's been treating them and even more when Caleb finds all the AIs in Nathan's room. This makes him seem creepy and disturbing. It seems like he's using these AIs for the wrong reason and mistreating them. When Caleb forms his plan to rescue Ava, we're rooting for him. We want him to save Ava and get away from Nathan. \n\nBut, that all comes crashing down when we realize that Nathan isn't the antagonist or the enemy at all. Sure, he has his flaws and he definitely isn't perfect but he isn't nearly as bad as we thought. In fact, Ava seems to be the enemy. At least, we lose sympathy for her. Caleb feels stupid and mislead, as do we. Then, when Caleb admits that the doors are already opened, we know that this is bad. We know that Ava will use this to her advantage and we immediately want her to be stopped. We now root for Nathan and Caleb, but in a different way. We feel angry at Caleb for being such a fool and we feel angry at ourselves for having sympathy for Ava, too. When Ava kills Nathan we are angry and we even feel bad for Nathan. It's a total switch that the audience doesn't see coming and it's brilliant. \n\nOf course, the acting is really good too Oscar Isaac is amazing. The statement that Ex Machina gives about human kind is really good and when we're finished watching it makes us not even trust ourselves. It's a really great twist and it's unpredictable for once. Really nice to see in a film. ",

Why did the film kill those characters, what larger narrative need did it serve. What did it mean for THOSE characters. Why did they fail? \n\n(EDIT: just want to add, I fully understand Thanos's aims, they work perfect for me, I'm just asking what killing the character's meant for the film)\n\nI've discussed this with my friends and all their answers come down to \"because Thanos is stronger\" but that just isn't good enough. When a character succeeds in a film it's from growing and becoming stronger to overcome the conflict, sometimes (and in the best of films) the conflict comes from within. \n\nSo what does a film say when a character fails. Well, that has to be the point right? It's making a statement of their lack of growth, something internal that is holding them back.\n\nYou could say the internal conflict that Thanos (love his character btw) has to battle with is making sacrifices for the bigger picture (wiping out half of populations, killing his daughter etc.) so the heroes failing should be apposing that, them failing is because they COULDN'T make that sacrifice. THAT would of made sense to me, but I feel the film doesn't accomplish that (I go more in-depth in the article linked above).\n\nMy question to you guys, what I would love to discuss, is what did the film make you feel? What character's worked? which didn't? Do you think it succeeded in it's aims? Do you think the film has a point it's trying to state? If yes, what? If not, why do you think it fails?\n\nI just want to hear more views. Excited to read your comments and get a good discussion going.",

As anyone whose seen the film will know, American Beauty depicts a remarkably odd, quiet relationship in the form of Barbara and Frank Fitts, who on first glance seem remarkably repressed and unhappy. However, even when I first watched the film in cinemas in 1999, it seemed to me that their relationship had a kind of tenderness which no-one else seemed to think it did, and indeed I wasn't surprised, over a decade later, to find this on the Wikipedia page:\n\n\"Mendes cut much of Barbara's dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence.\"\n\nNo dispute here but this is my question: does anyone have the script without those parts cut? Or even any idea of what was in them at all? I know there are all kinds of people here, including some who've worked in film, so you never know.. the curiosity near kills me to know in slightly more absolute terms about their relationship. If somewhere there are original script excerpts where they are revealed, though repressed and abnormal, to need each other in some kind of way, I think I'd very briefly be the happiest man alive to read it.\n\nMany thanks for your time. Furthermore, if a pure 'question' doesn't satisfy the 'generate an in depth discussion' format, then I would of course be most interested to read thoughts generally on Barbara and Frank's relationship if you have any.",

        "text": "I enjoyed this a lot and strongly reacted to it.  The impressionist visuals are striking.  When I start watching a silent film, my mind rebels for a couple minutes but then settles in fine.   A sparseness of written titles in this film adds to the drama.  The special effects are quite good for the time period.  \n\nIn the film, an \"evil\" woman arrives in a small town with no backstory.  She is the temptress, the succubus.  The city girl with her lust and temptation.  She seduces \"the man\" (who bears a strong resemblance to John Hamm in my opinion).  The city woman is always smoking.  She is unpure and scheming to sell her lover's farm.  \n\nContrasting her is the man's wife, the farm wife.  The wholesomeness of the mundane.  Unshaven, the man is dirt while the woman is clean, Madonna.  \n\nThe dog knows something is wrong.  The man schemes to kill his wife out on a boat so that he can be with his lover.  The wife almost bails but goes on the boat trip.  The man has second thoughts decides not to kill her.  The wife is distraught.  \n\nHe takes her to the city to try to apologize.  She runs off the bus.  They dodge cars.  Amazing scene.  They eat bread.  Witness a wedding. \n\nThey partake in the wonders of the city. A haircut during which the man threatens another who hits on his wife.  A photograph.  Comedic moments like a statue falling and the man replaces with doll head.  She is acting a little crazy and the man appreciates this spontaneity.  \n\nThey enter a carnival.  There's a roller coaster and rides.  As hula dancers dance in the background, the man throws balls at live pigs, making them slide down a chute.  One escapes, he chases it, the pig drinks wine and stumbles around.  This leads to a dance number...the crowd applauds them, they share a drink and are inebriated with love and alcohol.\n\n\"We'll sail home by moonlight...another honeymoon.\"\n\nA storm rolls in prefiguring his personal storm.  The boat rocks.  Lightning everywhere.  The boat capsizes.  The man survives, can't find his wife.  The town rallies to help, even the temptress rushes out to spy.  \n\nThey do not find the wife...she has perished.  The temptress approaches him and he starts to strangle her out of pure rage.  However...the wife has been found alive!  \n\nThe evil woman leaves town, defeated and the farm couple kiss.  \n\nThe film asks us to put all the blame on the evil woman, and redeem the man even though he has been unfaithful and attempted to kill two different women before stopping.  \n\nDirected by F. W. Murnau of \"Nosferatu\" fame, who was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Shakespeare and Ibsen.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise:_A_Song_of_Two_Humans\n\nI look forward to watching more classics and sharing my impressionist reviews.",

        "text": "***Spoilers for \"Phantom Thread\"***\n\nI really like how much color can tell in a film. *Paterson* did it with black and white and *Nocturnal Animals* with a whole arrange of colors, just like the UK TV-show *Utopia*. In *Phantom Thread*¸ it was the usage of cold and warm colors/lighting that caught my eye, which made me start to think about it. Here’s briefly my attempt at explaining to you what I think that these colors mean. (I’ve made a blog post about it, where I go into more depth, so if you’re interested, you can read it [here](https://film4fan.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/my-interpretation-of-phantom-thread/))\n\nIt all comes down to this: Alma is represented by the warm colors, while Woodcock’s represented by the colder ones. Every time Alma’s on screen, warm lighting dominates, just like when Woodcock’s on-screen cold lighting dominates. Not only in the lighting, but it’s also shown in their way of dressing, as Alma only wears brown tinted colors and Woodcock only wears blue, white and black, and it’s shown in their characters; Woodcock’s cold, heartless and sad on the inside due to the loss of his mother and Alma’s the so-called sweet and caring one, who’ll fill in that maternal need Woodcock wants. These colors help to tell their story of their constant will to be in control. Their respective colors will have a visual fight with each other, just like their characters will have verbally. Every time Alma’s in control, the warm colors dominate, while when Woodcock’s in control, cold ones dominate. The most obvious example of this is when Alma’s poisoned Woodcock and he becomes sick for a couple of days. During this period, every scene where the two of them are in, warm lighting prevails, but the first morning Woodcock’s well again, the cold lighting has returned and is able to fill up their scenes again. The film’s filled with moments of their back and forth game of dominance, which brings us to the question; who will win this battle for dominance? Woodcock’s in need of a maternal role in his life, yet he doesn’t want to give up his power and Alma loves having Woodcock all to herself as a submissive, vulnerable man. They’re both in need of something the other has to offer, though they both want to keep their powerful role in their relationship. That’s why I think that their game won’t have a true winner and that their lives will continue to exist as it was shown in the film; a constant back and forth. \n\nThat’s in short my interpretation of *Phantom Thread*’s color. What did you think of it, and am I anywhere near to what it actually means? \n",

Is it wrong to have scenes of intimacy that may be seen as \"slow\" or \"boring\"? Or maybe people mean \"lean\" to imply something else. I get that movies, in some sense, should be \"fat-free\", as in not having anything wasted, but I feel like a lot of people take this to mean fast and tight, rather than taking as much time as needed to build a scene to its true potential.",

Whether or not this is the case, most will agree he is smiling at Andrew, giving Andrew the approval he felt he deserves the entire movie.\n\nWith or without verbal “Good Job”, this would have the same effect.  It urges the receiver towards contentment of being good, and inhibiting their pursuit on the path towards being great. Fletcher previously told Andrew of how horrible these 2 words are, for this reason.\n\nWouldn’t it follow that Fletcher, if he honestly wanted Andrew to go down in musical history, should have intentionally avoided this communication?  Perhaps it is Fletcher’s true moment of giving up on Andrew... however, the timing of the story doesn’t seem to suggest that. This leads me to think:  Is the final scene that of Fletcher getting the upper hand and “winning” against the ignorant Andrew, who is still pursuing approval (potentially instead of greatness)?\n\nRegardless, great movie! I’ll def give it another watch soon.\n—-\nEdit: or perhaps the final approval of Fletcher is his continual abuse of Andrew in attempt to turn him into a great jazz drummer. After realizing Andrew has grown and overcome negative criticism completely, Fletcher is now testing Andrew with affirmation to see if he will become complacent.",

        "text": "I watched Brazil a day ago and have been thinking about it quite a bit. I don't consider myself much of a film guy or an analyst, but one thing the movie oddly reminded me of was Albert Camus's *L’Étranger*.\n\nIn particular, Mr. Helpmann's quotes about 'the game' of society reminded me of Albert Camus describing his book: \"I simply meant that the hero of the book is condemned because he doesn't play the game.\"\n\nThis especially struck me near the end when Mr. Helpmann speaks to Lowry in the padded cell and says, \n\"the rules of the game are laid down, we all have to play them.\"\n\nIt is as [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/6w7i3x/terry_gilliams_brazil_now_heres_a_film_that_needs/) says: \n&gt;And finally, I figured the film's message out - in a society that sanctifies normality and encourages ambition only insofar as it is helpful for the state, any deviation is so unusual and hard to grasp that the deviant only has one place to go - the mental hospital.\n\nSam Lowry has no ambition other than his seemingly insane pursuit of a woman he happened to see in his dreams. He doesn't want to be promoted, and that shocks members of society around him. Someone in the movie even notes that he is the first person to ever refuse a promotion to Information Retrieval. \n\nNot only is he odd in that sense, but him going out of his way to empathetically assuage what others would see as nothing more than shameful bureaucratic errors—like the arrest and overcharge of Buttle or Jill's detention—is strange in a society where the only concern seems to be paperwork, not justice, morality, or love.\n\nFor these reasons, Sam Lowry is a Stranger to the world of Brazil, and like Meursault, his fatal mistake is something inane to their societies: impeding the bureaucratic process for the sake of love and empathy, or shooting an innocent man just because of \"the sunlight.\"\n\n\n",

Now that it's been around six years since I watched it, I'm a lot more mature and a totally different person, obviously. I've gotten a ton into film and obviously Eternal Sunshine is one everyone talks about. It's especially famous for leaving people with a huge emotional impact or at least it hits people emotionally and personally in some way. I've really wanted to revisit this movie for a while and last night I finally did! \n\nI was totally expecting some similar emotional awakening to happen to me after I watched it. But unfortunately, that didn't happen. I felt like I had just watched a really great movie and it's pretty much a perfect film. Charlie Kaufman is also my favourite filmmaker and I was happy to be revisiting it, now that I knew more about who was behind the great plot. The idea for this movie is pretty awesome and original. The love story is touching and real. It's heartbreaking but also makes you feel really happy. The characters are really realistic and believable and they're also quite loveable. But somehow, I just didn't feel that connection to it that everyone else describes. \n\nI think it's because I can never really experience it for the first time. I remembered almost every scene from watching it as a 10 year old, but I remembered the scenes separately and not what they meant together. I remembered the plot and I knew the ending and all the spoilers in between. Watching it for a second time was weird because I already knew everything that happened through watching videos on it and it being popular and I also had memories of the scenes from being a kid. I think it was hard for me to get a real experience with this film.  It's really great and I love it but I lacked that emotional connection with it. I wish I had never seen it so young because I couldn't really understand the value of it or the emotional aspects of it as well as I can now. I mean I was only 10, what can I expect. It just sucks. I wish I had that emotional connection to it that everyone else describes. Luckily, I have an emotional connection with Kaufman's other films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation and even Anomalisa. Nonetheless, Eternal Sunshine was amazing and I'll watch it for years to come. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on it?? ",

On the hand, it’s a dramatic courtroom battle. The film forces me to change my mind with each new piece of information, making me reconsider events I’ve just seen in plain sight. And yet, after all that intense speculation and personal debate, the ending is bleak and noir-ish. None of the characters come out looking good. Nothing is gained by anyone. When you zoom out, it almost feels like nothing even happened.\n\nI notice both of these elements, to varying degrees, in Farhadi’s other work I’ve seen (*About Elly*, *The Past*, *The Salesman*), as well as Cristian Mungiu (*4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days*, *Graduation*, *Beyond the Hills*) and Andrey Zvyagintsev (*Leviathan*, *Loveless*). I think a film like Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s *Winter Sleep* could also qualify.\n\nDo these films belong in some kind of 'subtle thriller' subgenre I'm not aware of? Or are these elements very common and I’m just randomly associating them in these films?\n \nWhat are some similar films you would recommend to me that have these elements?",

        "author": "CineRanter-YTchannel",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8ejh0d/clint_eastwoods_high_plains_drifter_a/",
        "text": "For a video version of my thoughts, see here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4hLVDc9yrs\n\nHigh Plains Drifter is Western star Clint Eastwood’s first attempt at directing one of his own westerns. Given that he was mentored by the likes of Don Siegel and my personal favourite director Sergio Leone it’s no wonder that Eastwood went on to make hits like The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven.\n\nDrifter is lauded as being one of the very first revisionist westerns as opposed to the classic traditional westerns. These were a branch of American Western movies that coincided with the 'New Hollywood' era, acting as the swan song of the Western Old Myth where cars started to make odd appearances, marking the way technology and capitalism would put a deathblow on the frontier or pioneer spirit. Elements include a darker, more cynical tone, with focus on the lawlessness of the time period, favouring realism over romanticism. Anti-heroes are still common, but with stronger roles for women and more-sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans and Mexicans. Regarding power and authority, these depictions favour critical views of big business, the American government, masculine figures (including the military and their policies), and a turn to greater historical authenticity.\n\nThe movie concerns a…well, drifter who wonders into a small town from the high plains. He’s a mysterious fellow, cool and gruff looking and noticeably viler than the usual Eastwood western character. The movie borrows heavily from Leone’s Once Upon a Time in the West and High Noon for its plot, as clearly the mysterious stranger has a beef with some of the dwellers in the town. The film often intercuts with a blurry flashback of a Marshall being whipped by three gunmen with close to the entire town standing by watching, doing nothing to help the poor fellow. The drifter, or stranger, accepts an offer to help the townsfolk defend against the three gunmen who have recently been released from prison and are on their way to cause havoc. He accepts only after he is given free rein to do as he pleases around the town, an offer which he does not waste at all, forcibly taking any woman he wants and throwing families out of their hotel rooms so he can have the entire building to himself.\n\nOne you unglue your eyes from the gorgeous scenery, filmed on location, you understand that this is definitely not your typical John Wayne flick. I’d argue that the movie is just as brutal and cynical as Leone’s westerns if not more. At least Sergio’s movies had the humour to counterbalance the depraved killings and the degenerate treatment of women. This film just feels mean, and the nastiness all comes from the character of the stranger. You can feel his rage radiate just as soon as he appears in the first couple of seconds in the film against the backdrop of the high plains and accompanied by that creepy and eerie score that often rings throughout the film. In addition to the cruel nature of the film there is a surprising supernatural element at play. Westerns often have mysterious, strong silent protagonists but high plains drifter might have gone as far as to have the stranger be some kind of spectre or ghost, sent to the town to punish them for their sins. He seems to enjoy giving them misery. We never really are told who he is or where he comes from. All we know is it is very difficult to side with him as a protagonist and as such we are left with an uneasy feel throughout the film from which we can only be unburdened after knowing just what he wants and why he’s doing it – but we never do, which is probably why I was left with such an uncomfortable feeling after the film was finished.\n\nMachoism is also a meaty theme of most westerns but that is given a slap to the face also in the film. Much is explored in regards to the townsfolk not doing anything when they are oppressed or when oppression becomes apparent to them. Grown men moan to each other about the Stranger’s behaviour and then point out “well, why didn’t you do anything about it then?” as he takes and violates anything he wants whilst no-one has the balls to do anything about it. That fact that we can’t identify with the silent mysterious main character like we usually do during westerns puts us more into the shoes of the agitated townsfolk, which was a nice twist. It adds to the argument that High Plains Drifter is a deconstruction of the myths of the old west. Usually when Eastwood is punching a man across a table or delivering a nonchalant verbal beat down we are laughing and enjoying it. Here it’s different though, and we see the cruel behaviour for what it is, even if some of the victims deserve retribution. It’s difficult to know where we stand because the townspeople deserve punishment for what they’ve done but at the same time just how much of the Strangers behaviour is acceptable? This kind of uncertain pussyfooting around from us as the viewer is much like the townspeople’s choice of not choosing a side when the poor man was being whipped.\n\nDuring the flashback the Marshall who’s getting whipped damns the townsfolk to hell whilst he dies, and my personal take on the film is that the Stranger is a kind of curse or angel of death sent to punish the town. The allegory can’t get blunter then him literally put up a signpost that says hell and have the town paint all the buildings red. Before the film is finished fire is raging throughout the town and everyone who was involved in the Marshall whipping gets some kind of upcommance for their actions.\n\nThis movie is definitely a ‘different’ kind of western. Its plot is nothing out of the ordinary but it’s given a supernatural and sadistic treatment that makes it stand out from the crowd. The Stranger opens up healthy debate on who or what exactly he is. Whatever he is, he’s definitely one of the most memorable characters Easwood’s played, and that’s saying something.",

        "text": "Isle of Dogs is what you expect from Wes Anderson with the craft, framing, and dollhouse handcrafted touch that brings the usual charm about a group of quirky characters and canines who try to survive a quirky strangely dark political, environmental, and immigration parable. I highly recommend it as a very solid animated followup to Fantastic Mr Fox. \n\nThe only thing that stops me from loving it is this weird decision to not have the Japanese characters subtitled and instead use a translator character through the interpreter and the foreign exchange student. This is a strange decision to me because it severed me from engaging with Atari and his uncle who are respectively the hero and the villain of this story. I was just waiting for someone to translate instead of being caught up with Atari's emotional state and perspective. Even visually, I didn't understand what Atari was emoting while framed in Wes Anderson stillness. Then at the end, they show subtitles for the doctor and I was baffled why this minor character gets subtitles but not our hero or the villain? With Wes Anderson's decision, he inadvertently isolated me during parts of the story.\n\nThe other talk about cultural appropriation is overblown, it's just american cultural tourism by paying tribute to the style and culture of Japan with a neat soundtrack and nice visual flourishes. Though it would of been great to connect to the Japanese characters who are at the center of this film. \n\nCan anyone make sense in this decision whether it's to connect to a theme or idea? Thanks!",

        "text": "Hey everyone!\nI'm preparing a workshop for small children (aged 3 to 6 and maybe 6 to 10) to educate them on cinema, get them to watch films, talk about them and try and teach them basic notions of film elements like plot, characters, shots, sound, camera movement, etc. All of this gradually.\nI was wondering if you guys have any experience with teaching children this age on cinema, if you have any suggestions of what films to show (preferably short films, not only for time reasons but also cause their attention span might be quite narrow) and what topics to cover.\nThanks in advance!",

Examples of films we have shown this year are \"Fanny and Alexander\", \"City Lights\", \"Magnolia\", \"United 93\", and \"The Odd Couple\". \n\nSince the club has been going for a couple of years, we have begun to have trouble picking new films for screening. We always like to have a balance between popular and unknown films in order to attract a reasonable crowd. \n\nMy question for this discussion is if there any films that you would consider to be essential viewing for this club that would align with our mission and still be able to get people in seats?",
