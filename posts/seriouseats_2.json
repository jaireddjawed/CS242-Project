        "text": "I have a 3.5 lb bone-in pork shoulder blade roast with the skin on. I'd like to use Kenji's pork shoulder recipe, but I'm not sure how long I should cook the meat for since the roast is half the size. I know it has to reach at least 160 and stay above that until it's tender and the collagen has rendered; I can just kind of start early and plan to roast it until it's done tomorrow, but a ballpark would be great!\n\nAlso - I'm assuming that I should still salt the meat 8 hours ahead despite the smaller size. Is there any reason to not salt way further ahead of time?  I've been following Samin Nosrat's salting advice, and I'm used to salting 12-24 hours ahead - I did 48 for Kenji's prime rib this Christmas with great results. Also, is that fork twist thing to see if something is dry-brined enough a generally reliable test on all pork? On any other meats?  \n\nThanks in advance for your advice!  I can't wait to eat this. My only regret is that I couldn't get my hands on a full pork shoulder for this - there is definitely not going to be enough skin to go around in this house, haha.",

        "text": "For dietary reasons (Celiac related, yes I know bacon is generally gluten free), I need to omit bacon from [Kenji's gyros recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/greek-american-lamb-gyros-recipe).\n\nHe says he uses the bacon mostly for fat and salt content. I just so happen to be making the carnitas recipe a few days before. The last time I made the carnitas, I had more fat than I felt I needed to add back to the meat. Could I mimic the effects of bacon by saving some of the fat from the carnitas, and adding it to the ground lamb? Any ideas on how much fat to sub for 3 oz of bacon?",

        "text": "So it would appear Kenji has dropped a NEW chicken wing recipe: https://www.seriouseats.com/ultimate-extra-crispy-double-fried-confit-buffalo-wings\n\nAnd the new method highlighted here is a double fry.  But he seems to suggest that the value of the first fry is primarily to break down collagen.  And that really the lower you go the better.\n\nIt seems to me that sous vide would accomplish this best of all right?  You could put them in for something like 150 for 4 hours and break down that collagen then throw the already vac sealed bag right into the freezer or fridge then pull them out for the final fry as he suggests.\n\nHe briefly mentions sous vide as an option though suggests one might confit them in duck fat in the sous vide but I‚Äôd imagine you could also let them confit in their own juices and fat in the sous vide bag.  Seems like this would be way easier than double frying, especially if you are doing a large number of wings.\n\nAny thoughts on this?  Has anyone tried this?  If not I‚Äôll probably give it a go at some point.",

Even with just the two, it fumed the kitchen pretty good, producing some good coughs. Wife gave me the stink eye worrying it would be too hot. The dish had a pleasant warmth to it (perfect warmth imho), but I can‚Äôt imagine adding 6-8 as the recipe suggests. Also, arbol chilis might be hotter than the ones in the recipe.\n\n-The first batch of chicken stuck to the bottom of the pan pretty good. The pan was smoking hot and oil added just before chicken. This was earthier to lack of seasoning (new wok) or I didn‚Äôt swirl the oil enough. The second batch didn‚Äôt stick nearly as bad.\n\n- Stir frying is serious fun. The chopping and prep is worth it.

I did 225 in the oven with the wings in a Dutch oven. Let them sit in the freezer for a bit, then heated the oil up to 375. Dropped them in for about 8 minutes, and while they *were* good, they seemed to have some major shrinkage and a little over cooked.   \n\nI‚Äôm glad to have tested these out before hand, otherwise I‚Äôd be ashamed to serve these this weekend. Does anyone have tips or modifications they did to get these perfect? Thanks in advance",
