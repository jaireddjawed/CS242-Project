        "text": "I’m sure plenty of other parents are in the same boat. When I say broke, all the bills will go out fine, and i’ve got the food shopping money and petrol money put to one side, so nobody’s going to be cold or hungry in January. But this is the first year ever where I just don’t have anything spare for dad stuff, no nights out to the pub, no new trainers which is a bit of a Christmas tradition for me, no airfix kit which again is something I usually pick up from town to keep me busy between Christmas and New Years. \n\nI shouldn’t moan, my Daughter never asked for anything really expensive and she got everything she was hoping for, so that made me happy. The wife got some nice presents too, and we’ve enjoyed some good food and company yesterday. But I feel like (and maybe this is just our family) dads get the short straw at Christmas, we say thanks for the socks, cook the Christmas dinner, put the toys together, go to the garage in the rain for batteries. When it’s all died down, and the wrapping paper and boxes have been sorted,  there’s always that lovely quiet period where I can sit and sip single malt and build an airfix kit while the hours slip by blissfully.\n\nThis year it was literally just socks for me, two packs wrapped separately. I thought it was a joke at first and once the last present had been opened somebody was going to spring out with an interesting gift, not expensive, just….thoughtful? But that’s another story. \n\nMaybe i’m just bored, or feeling unappreciated, but Christmas hasn’t been a good time for me this year, and having just finished the sums to see how much we would have for fun money this January it’s right to the line, about £2 left over. It’s going to be a very long wait until payday.",
