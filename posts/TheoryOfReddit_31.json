        "text": "I've been meaning to make a post like this for a while, but haven't gotten around to it.\n\nRelatively recently, I've noticed a wave of a new kind of spam bot on reddit. It's not the sex spam shit bots that Reddit admins cracked onto (that became very bad a few months ago and the admins had to devote special time to it) but bots with simple usernames that link to YouTube videos. The YouTube channels uploading the videos are new, don't usually have profile pictures (to my knowledge) and repost without crediting sources. The videos themselves are reposts of videos that have been previously popular on Reddit.\n\nI'm thinking a spam network has figured out how to find older successful reddit posts, upload the videos under these spam YouTube channels, and link to them using brand new Reddit accounts as some sort of massive spam network to... I dunno why, exactly. ~~My best guess is to make these reddit accounts valuable to advertisers and get them over the karma threshold many subs have now.~~ **EDIT:** I didn't even think about the possibility that they're mining ad revenue off YouTube. That seems far more likely.\n\nI don't believe the admins have cracked onto this yet, since [this /r/movies post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4ltpk0/how_different_focal_lengths_of_lenses_can_affect/) is currently racing to the front page. The account /u/hht99 is the uploader (note the simple non-sensical username) and has only ever made this reddit post. As I found using KarmaDecay, [here is the original reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3vew4d/how_different_focal_lengths_of_lenses_can_affect/?ref=search_posts) posted five months ago that racked up 3,273 points. Another video on that YouTube channel (also assumably a repost), [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4lpm9s/a_submersible_robot_in_human_form_developed_at/?ref=search_posts), was also posted by /u/hgnn87 (another simple username).\n\nAm I onto something or am I reading too far into the whole thing?

        "text": "I'm interested in a study of relationship between the size of various subs and the quality of front-page submissions. Although perceived quality is inherently subjective in nature, I think a metric which counts \"quality complaint\" comments left on front-page submissions would be valid. \n\nBecoming a default sub often has the effect of lowering the quality of submissions and the quality of front-page material. IMO /r/dataisbeautiful is a good example of this effect. On that sub you can find many complaints from long-time subscribers about the popularity of low-quality content.\n\nIt seems to me that this effect is not limited to subs which become default. I believe that the quality of submission on the front page increases with number of subscribers to a point, but then begins to decrease as the various \"hive-mind\" effects start to outweigh the votes of those trying to forward the sub's vision. /r/TrueReddit, for example, has suffered a drop in quality recently IMO, and many long-time subbers have expressed frustration.\n\nIt also seems that the \"hive-mind\" effects are more detrimental in some subs than others. /r/funny, (again, IMO) maintains its function well in spite of the huge number of subscribers. On the opposite end of the spectrum, /r/AskScience remains true to its purpose through heavy moderation. Perhaps there is something we can learn from this that will reveal something about human nature, crowd behavior, or about how to better manage subreddits as they grow in size.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this phenomenon, my approach to the problem, and links to related research if any exists.

After tagging them over time, I was unsurprised to find that on many large and popular subreddits like /r/worldnews, /r/gaming, /r/movies and /r/todayilearned, discussion is dominated by the same 600-1000 \"power users\", with *significant* overlap across all the default subreddits.  \n\nWe like to talk about the vote/score disparity- how a front page thread with 5,000 upvotes seems less popular than if it displayed its real score, which *might be* 50,000 or hell, 500,000 upvotes.  This seems to be the prevailing theory, as /u/StezzerLolz mentioned the other day.  Is it *really* the case than a random, front-page r/funny post with 3,500 upvotes has \"really\" been upvoted 100,000 or more times?  I find that highly unlikely.  \n\nBut look at the number of comments, which can't really be fudged, and we see a very different story.  With very few exceptions, Reddit's most popular front page stories don't exceed 4000 comments.   The only threads that do are occasional sports game threads for world series/championship finals, major terrorist attack/political events in worldnews, the most elite IAmAs and r/AskReddit, which makes up well over 90% of threads with more than 20,000 comments as /u/alexleavitt's post suggests [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3v8tts/what_is_the_most_commented_on_thread_of_reddit/cxlsmu4).  \n\nReddit has in the region of 44m accounts (the last figure we have is 36 million in June last year, using the long-term default appreciation rate, eg. askreddit went from 9m to 11.5m users in that time, we can extrapolate a roughly 22% increase).   Tumblr, which has a lower Alexa ranking, has [just under 300m accounts](https://www.tumblr.com/about).  This information already suggests that active users with accounts are a tiny number of Reddit's users, even in comparison with other major (mostly) anonymous social content networks.  \n\nBut I'm interested in more than just going over things we already know.  Because even of those \"40m\" accounts, only a tiny number are actually active, and that's where definitions get interesting.  What I want to know is, how many users do we suppose are *actually* active in the Reddit \"community\" as a whole.  Who know the in-jokes, who understand the meta, who comment actively across the site, who have *maybe* considered going to a meetup.   Personally, my guess is no more than 20,000-30,000 absolute maximum.  What are your thoughts.  ",

        "text": "Since it's launch in 2009 Imgur.com has been a favorite of Redditors.  In the past four years (at least) it has been the #1 link source.  The relationship has been a strong symbiotic partnership, with Imgur providing a valuable service (image hosting for free) while Reddit provides the valuable service of sending Imgur lots of traffic.  \n\nMore recently, Imgur has opened up comments on their site, added tagging, and generally attempted to foster an autonomous community.  From my perspective, it is inferior as a community platform in just about every way.\n\n[Then, today admins announced that Reddit will be in the images and gifs can now be directly uploaded and hosted on site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4kuk2j/reddit_change_introducing_image_uploading_beta/).  Since this is Imgur bread and butter, it's got to be a big hit for them.  And given the weakness of their community platform, I'm really curious where this will leave them.  It's got to be a big blow to their traffic if Redditors really do adopt native hosting.  Will Imgur pivot further toward their internal community, or perhaps seek to partner with another organization to be the host of choice?\n\nI'm also curious about this move from the Reddit perspective.  It means a lot more computing power will be needed, which seems like it would be costly.  Since they already host the thumbnail, I guess it may be a smaller marginal cost.  Even so, what is the value proposition from Reddit's perspective?  They aren't getting more users, just added views from the same users.  Would advertisers really value that?\n\nI'm interested in your thoughts on how this change will impact both Reddit and Imgur in the medium and long term.",

        "text": "One thing continues to astound me about Reddit, and it's that **Redditors do not understand that Reddit is really big.** It's the [28th most visited site in the world, and 9th in the US](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com). AskReddit alone pulls in [the best part of 20 *million* unique users a month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic)\n\nWhen it comes to social media, if that's what Reddit is, it's beaten only by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. To compare, 4chan ranks at 787th worldwide, or 371st in the US. Reddit is big. It's the titan of anonymous message boards.\n\nIt therefore is very curious to me that Reddit users seem to act like nothing has changed since I joined over half a decade ago. The average Redditor still seems to believe that it's some tiny, inconsequential thing. People always say things like \"remember, the views you see on Reddit are a tiny minority\", completely missing the fact that it is, indisputably, 'The Front Page of the Internet'. It's not some elite think tank or something, the hoi poloi are here in force and have been for years.\n\nI've spent some time thinking about this, and, while I'm sure there are many factors, the most convincing to me is the idea that upvote counts give people completely the wrong idea of scale.\n\nThe thinking is fairly simple. It's well known that Reddit essentially vote-caps once a post gets above four to five thousand upvotes, and will accumulate points at a much more subdued rate. This is why 'Test Post, Please Ignore' is still one of the all-time top-rated posts on /r/all, even though the site had fewer total visitors at the time by several orders of magnitude. Theoretically, without this mechanism karma inflation would occur and the top posts would be constantly replaced with This Weeks Meme™ as the userbase grows.\n\nThe way this works, however, is very misleading to the simple human brain. The top post in /r/AskReddit today currently has 5227 upvotes, even though the subreddit gets one to two million unique users *a day*. As such, we look at 5K upvotes and think 'huh, that's decent for a medium-size site, but not excessive', whereas the reality is that the true number is probably in the tens to hundreds of thousands.\n\nAs for the practical use of this, I've no idea. I just thought it an interesting insight worth sharing. I must admit, I wonder how Reddit would change if vote-capping was turned off for a day on April the first next year. Just remember, that time when you said something stupid and humiliating in front of a few thousand total strangers? It was actually a million.",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nfirst thing I want to say is that this is not a feature request or anything alike. I am just seeking ideas on how would you go about solving the following problem for a reddit-like community. In reddit, a new post appears on 'new' and if it gets enough interest, it makes it to the trending page. This makes a lot of sense for posts that are 'pieces of news', or other relatively volatile content. However, it doesn't work well for 'links/entries' whose relevance persists in time.\n\nImagine you have a reddit-like community where every post is a book. Someone posts a book, people start upvoting it saying how they liked it or dlisked it and after the fuzz the book entry falls forgotten. The posts of this community, though, build up into a database, a catalog of books. This brings two problems, first, we need to avoid repetition of books, this is relatively easy to control with autocomplete + mods. However, it might be that a book that was added 2 years ago, now becomes trendy again, for several reasons:\n\n- They are making its movie and people wants to discuss about it again.\n- The writer recently passed away.\n- etc\n\nSo, as the title explains, I need a way to make a post (a book in this case) eligible to be trending again, while preserving the previous upvotes and comments.\n\nBasically, there needs to be a button, let's call it 'bump' that enables anyone to vote for that old post to be trending again. So after  a few 'bumps' this post could be sent back to 'new' or straight to 'trending'.\n\nThis has some conceptual and implementation problems. First, we don't want to lose the old upvotes, but we cannot use them to calculate how trending the post is after the bump. There's other ways to consider a post as 'trending', for example, if a post has a lot of new comments, but I've discarded this idea. I want the community to actively ask for the post to be on trending again.\n\nWhat I seek here is basically a discussion on how would you guys go about it, and if anyone has any other ideas on how to approach the matter. I'm not quite sure this post belongs here, but it is just a modification a reddit-like community may need.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Ever since the yearly \"Summer Reddit\" drama waves (jailbait, fappening, FPH/Pao) started forcing Reddit to consider how it moderates content, there's been a term flung about quite a bit by both sides of the argument, almost always in derision. \"Safe spaces\".\n\nThe idea of an echo chamber, a place where others can shut out all outside opinions, circlejerking to their heart's content, occasionally spilling over into other subs. It's been used as liberally as \"cuck\" and \"SJW\" to describe a lot of people. It's considered a bad thing, letting people with bad views exist, festering until boiling over and fucking things up. Ergo, the solution is to remove safe spaces... Right?\n\nFirst off, Reddit is by design based around safe spaces. Subreddits, downvotes, the content sorting that Reddit was founded upon is based around users cultivating content to suit their interests. And should they not? No one wants shitposting from Advise Animals clogging up space. But still, FPH shouldn't get a safe space, and none of their kin should either, right?\n\nBut I don't think that FPH would exist and be as strong as it is if Reddit wasn't as clustered as it is.\n\nThis all ties back into the Eternal September dilemma. Everyone's a newbie because there's an endless stream of people who don't know the rules, too many to educate, too many to moderate. But were not the older sites safe spaces? Smaller forums where personal discussion forced a more community based tone, and thus imposed social sanctions upon posters.\n\nI think that the reason places like FPH happen is because the radicalism that the alt-right exploits is based around outrage, which is more effective in a setting like Reddit, where what is more easily accessible to viewers becomes more easily accessible to users, thus the strongest emotions win out.\n\nErgo, in a more cultivated space, those communities wouldn't swell to that size, as the outrage wouldn't build enough. And the smaller scale would better emphasize competition, as it wouldn't be as easy to game the system.\n\nAnd it's already happening. Quarantines, the potential for stronger moderation options, the potential for refined search and block options, they all tie into letting people make their own unique Reddit, separate from other Reddits. It's certainly more practical than trying to fight an endless war against a good sized portion of the user base.\n\nSo in short, decentralizing Reddit would make it better, letting for more community, and lessen the impact of the mob that grows toxicity. And plus, it's probably already happening.",

Or, do you find that you tend to agree with users you have upvoted without critically assessing their posts compared to users you have downvoted before? In a simpler way, when you read a post made by a user you have downvoted before, do you tend to deliberately find faults in the content of their posts/comments?\n\nAs silly as it may sound, I'd wager that there's a difference in how RES users and non RES users assess user generated content. RES users might tend to notice content made by users who they have either upvoted or downvoted before, essentially narrowing their engagement with user generated content. While non RES users might be less biased and thus their experience of Reddit might be broader, and of course - less biased. \n\n ",

        "title": "Why Reddit Struck Gold with Reddit Gold",
        "author": "hit_the_road",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4h7r1w/why_reddit_struck_gold_with_reddit_gold/",
        "text": "I come at this post as a self-styled expert on Reddit Gold because I am both a high-volume purchaser of the \"gold\", a member of many of the self-congratulatory and bizarre communities that serial gilders inhabit but also someone that never took it too seriously (used it troll, in fact) and am somewhat embarrassed about how many pixels I bought over the years at four bucks a pop. I am, to be sure done.\n\n\n                \nThis post will not reveal the secrets or so-called secrets of the \"Gold Community\" but will hope to share some insight into those communities as a means of explaining just how someone could rationally receive so much pleasure for receiving so little for a decent chunk of change. For some (like myself) it's about power and self-amusement but for others it is a serious and carefully studied act of altruism -- \"donating\" to the great supposed democratic engine that is Reddit and further the greater good. \n\nFor starters I do not, much like many of you in here, particularly like Reddit. I did not buy gold to support it nor did I gild posts I thought were worthy because they shared some special insight or demonstrated some extraordinary command of language. I gilded posts at random, I gilded posts ironically and I especially gilded posts that would be deemed, according to this little set of unspoken rules, undeserving. In short, I did it to amuse myself.\n\nDespite this over the years more and more I would find myself invited into serious and well-crafted secret subreddits that serve to house the supposed elite of the reddit gilders. Many of them are well-known, many are not, some are self-parody and others satirical versions. I myself created a subreddit for reddit's \"top\" gilders, /r/gilderguild (it should be noted so much gilding goes on in Reddit that the vast majority of gilders do not seek recognition or even post in reddit's official gold lounges) which was meant tongue-in-cheek originally.\n\nIt must be assumed that Reddit generates most of its revenue from Reddit Gold -- it is, to be fair, a few bits of code sold for $3.99 (or a bit less if you get 12 24 or 36 creddits) and is purchased en masse on a daily basis. This business model is similar to other internet sites like Patreon or Twitch or Kickstarter and among them is a common thread of wanting recognition, anonymously or not, for being altruistic. At the microeconomic level this is the utility wherein reddit gold lies, the power to affect eyeballs or make someone's day. It also, somewhat inadvertently, is the key to a close knit community of people who have in common only that they lavishly buy reddit gold but find each other in a subject-less, chatroom-like camaraderie that is unlike many other hidden away places on the social media site.\n\nIn this, then, Reddit invented itself another purpose for being a user -- to move up in notoriety and respect among ones peers and to feel more included and to aspire even more secret and even more exclusive subreddits in order to achieve some sort-of higher sense of belonging. It is, in some respects, like a MMORPG.\n\nSome people who participate in Reddit Gold communities (many of them) subscribe to strict principles and what could almost be called morals about who should receive gold, what or why. They discuss amongst themselves why so and so post was gilded and resent heavily a 'undeserving' gilded post as-if it reflects badly on them, those who giveth, so to speak.\n\nIn the end Reddit Gold does not have rules, it does not have purpose and it does not have any altruistic or generous properties in simply having it or giving it away. But it is the belief it does that drives many to buy it (which is fine) and further the greater belief that without such generosity Reddit would close down, or something similar.\n\nAs an aside it should also be noted that there is no more unpopular feat than gilding a post. Redditors see high volume gilders as show-offs, paradoxically as greedy and will downvote the post that was gilded often. Sometimes I met with anger or disgust, receiving PMs suggesting I give money to charity or begging for money from people hard on their luck. It should be mentioned that within the Reddit community itself there is no love for those who gild a lot, so that cannot really be the motivation.\n\nI ended up ranting a bit but meant to illustrate reddit gold itself is a sort-of community of its own and that also the act of gilding a post often has more to do with the person gilding it than \"gifting\" anything to the other. The product is a clever one, annoying to many, and perplexing to most. But for lots of people, it is an important (and perhaps only) aspect of Reddit they participate in and enjoy.\n\nFinally I did not mean to suggest I am Reddit's top gilder (far from it) nor did I mean to criticize Reddit Gold, subreddits about it or inspired by the members, only to make some observations as to its role on Reddit and to a grander extent it as a phenomenon of commerce in the digital age. \n\n\n\n\n\n ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4gy1uz/one_rule_to_replace_all_subreddit_rules/",
        "text": "The rules on most subreddits are pretty common sense stuff: no racism, no bullying, no spam, no downvote brigading, etc. That's all good, but I feel like listing that in every subreddit can get redundant... and it wastes valuable sidebar space. So what if we combined these common-sense rules into one master rule: **the good faith rule**? Instead of a wall of rules, there's one message: \"This subreddit abides by the Reddit Good Faith rule. All posts must be made in good faith. Posts made in bad faith will be removed.\" This, in addition to 1 or 2 sub-specific rules, of course. \n\nGenerally, [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) is defined as dealing with other parties honestly and sincerely--without malice, dishonesty, fraud or an intent to harm. The term is mostly used in legal dealings, but can be applied elsewhere. \n\nWhen somebody breaks most subreddit rules, they're usually posting in *bad faith*. For example: someone who posts to a sub for black women to repeatedly spam the \"n\" word. That person is looking to bully and/or harm others with his/her language. Same with other stuff like personal attacks, doxxing, spamming and lying. All of those are examples of unacceptable behaviors in most subreddits--and all are examples of posting in bad faith. \n\n-----\nExamples of *good faith* posting: honest &amp; civil disagreements, playful joking, on-topic posts and behavior that respects others' privacy. Even if the most stringent MRA meets the most ardent feminist, they *should* be able to have a constructive discussion as long as it's carried out in *good faith*. \n\nBenefit of a good-faith rule: with one rule, it eliminates the gray area left by some narrower rule sets. Example: in a race discussion, someone posts something negative about black people. If a quick glimpse at his post history indicates a string of posts to openly-racist subreddits, we can tell he's probably not making that post in good faith. We delete this post, as it violates the rules. This may not be possible under a \"no racism\" rule, as the post itself may not *necessarily* be racist--just negative towards a group of people. \n\nDownside of a good-faith rule: The rule itself is rather broad. If used improperly, it could open itself up to abuse. However, I'm putting this idea forward with the concept that it's *very clear* when somebody is not posting in good faith--regardless of the subject matter. We don't associate with people IRL who speak and act maliciously. Why would we tolerate those people online?\n\n----\n\n**TLDR:** My theory is that we could consolidate most common-sense forum/subreddit rules into one rule: the \"good faith\" rule. Every post on a site must be made with sincerity and without malicious intent. Failure of either criterion will warrant a post deletion or a ban. While there could be limitations to doing this, I feel that it would eliminate ambiguity in dealing with people who obviously don't have the community's best interests in mind. ",
