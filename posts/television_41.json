But I feel like this show is one of the rare cases where as it went on, the characters become more 3-dimensional and leaned away from their initial stereotypes.\nAnother show I can see this in is Community. Any other examples of shows that made their characters more complex as they progressed instead of just leaning into their stereotypes?",

They haven't finished introducing the main characters, they haven't gotten to the primary conflict from the first book, they're mostly focused on a character who I assume will die in the next few minutes to make the main character feel bad and push her character arc forward.\n\nThe books didn't hint at the big twist in book one because if everyone guessed it before you'd finished the first chapter of book one.\n\nI don't understand why the show did this.  I think the Halo TV show did this also; they rushed through about a billion things in episode 1, and then what sort of story is there left to tell in the rest of the season?\n\nI just want the shows to slow down, and tell a sensible story at a consistent and reasonable pace.",

On top of that another £26.50 a month for the newly released TIVO box with an XL TV package. Meaning that in 2010 it would cost roughly £39.50 a month for ALL the TV, £474 a year in total. This would include every bit of event TV from most of the world and every channel possible.\n\n\nHowever, these days let’s say for convenience sake, these shows air at the same time and me and my family watch Severance, The Boys, Stranger Things, Andor and House of the Dragon. This would require a subscription for Now TV (£10), Apple (£11), Disney (£8), Amazon (£9) and Netflix (£11). Adding up to a total of £49 a month/£588 a year. \n\n\nA TV licence is now priced at £159 a year. And a large virgin TV package in 2023 is priced at £39 a month, which is still handy to have as their are still plenty of shows not available on streaming or catch up. \n\n\nSo in 2010 it was £474 a year, yet now in 2023 is would cost £101 a **MONTH**, meaning a whopping **£1,212 a year**. Which really just makes you want to walk in to the ocean doesnt it? \n\nThis just makes me curious, how many people have ditched their set top boxes all together and gone to streaming? Is it the cheaper choice now? Is it a better choice? Or has it all gone a bit fucking mad to you like it has me? Or am I just sounding like an old man yelling at a cloud right now?",

        "text": "I know there’s obvious similarities to Breaking Bad, but who can complain about that? There is clever inter-connectivity with all the characters and plot points, all of the actors are amazing, it’s about moral corruption with everyone thinking they are committing crimes and doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, it’s cleverly shot, the characters are flushed out, etc. \n\nI have zero problems with anyone comparing it to BB because I love that show, and now I love this one.\n\nI watched the first season, and I actually didn’t know they were making a second. I didn’t keep up with any news about that. It seemed to end on a note that a limited series could have.\n\nI’ve watched the first two episodes of season two and I think it’s great. \n\nMy real confusion is that it doesn’t seem to be getting any hype. None of my friends I talk to about it have watched it or heard of it, I never see articles from popular movie/tv pages I follow on FB/Insta reporting it, nothing! Am I missing something? It’s one of the best shows I’ve followed in a long time and no one seems to know about it!\n\nI really think this is going to get the Breaking Bad treatment where people didn’t really know about it in the beginning, but it will explode in a year or two and be considered a masterpiece. I think it is. I think everything about it is great.",

        "text": "Was watching a nature documentary and as someone that is a chronic second-screener, it was hard to actually maintain my attention. My roommate and I will watch subtitled shows, but sometimes we're just \"not in the mood\" and would rather watch something that allows us to also veg on our phones at the same time. I've personally seen a rise in reality TV shows that seemed designed to exist as background noise, like the Circle or all of those friendly competition shows. \n\nThis is also speculation but I have to wonder if some shows, knowing they can only bank on 50% of their audiences visual attention but maybe 75% of their auditory attention, have started putting more auditory cues or \"what's this\" type dialogue to cue their \"viewer\" to pay attention, or if reality shows have started including more narration/reminders of what's actually happening, that kind of thing.\n\nThen again, there are lots of counter-examples to suggest that viewers are capable of paying attention to subtitled shows like Squid Game and other prestige TV shows that are still being analyzed shot-by-shot by their viewers.",

Every late night comic has made that reference in one way or another over the past decade or so that he’s been visible, you don’t see comedians sharing a joke that way much. Although it’s such an obvious observation that maybe it’s just always been a thing haha. \n\nI feel like the first guy I seen making that joke was Jon Stewart, is he the originator?

        "text": "I literally watched EVERYTHING that was released with Scooby from 1969 animations to todays latest movies and I do that regularly with my 12 yo daughter. And as far as I love rewatching one of her favorites \"Scooby Doo and WWE\" for the 178th time I really LOVE the fact that Velma is NOT the same as Scooby Doo series and movies. And to be honest I am dying out of laughter watching all the YT hate videos and reading hate comments and hate reviews about Velma. Is the series cringe? YES - 100%. Which Scooby Doo wasn't? Tell me... please... because again I have watched ALL OF IT multiple times - there is literally none episodes in existence that I haven't watched at least twice - and I yet have to find one that wasn't cringe - and I love it as this is what Scooby Doo is supposed to be. People are acting like Scooby was some sort of seriously deep, Oscar worthy drama/criminal. No it wasn't! It was always a stupid, cringy AF, shallow and predictable animation for 7yo's! You want sorta deep story with plot twists and non alternated Scoob universe - watch Mystery Incorporated. And as long as there gonna be Scooby Doo movies or series released as long I'm gonna watch it. Doesn't matter that I'm 35 (I got the daughter for support for now ;)) and the thing is more or less always the same - ghost that's not a ghost, shallow mystery, solving it and \"if it wasn't for you kids and the darn dog\" - there... that's the plot that you deeply all desire in Velma, but no... Velma is something DIFFERENT and I can applaud that someone had the guts to take it and put it upside down. Again, it's different. Better? Nope... but different. You know when I knew that the show is not going to be be great? About 10 seconds in the first episode when a bug came out of a locker and a second one came behind it and started to hump it. I literally did a facepalm and said out loud \"why?\". So yeah it wasn't great, but it was what it was... ok I guess. But the the reviews came and boy oh boy was it a treat. And the real cherry on top for me is that all the hate - and I know that because I watched like 20 YT videos to understand why people have so huge problem with it - really comes down to people that are offended by the white rasist jokes or making fun of things like masculinity or ocasionally trhowing in a grenade like loling out of standup comedians and #MeeToo. One of the most popular hate videos on Velma goes as far as calling it podophilic and demoralizing. Have any of you people checked with your child lately? Because a 16 yo being interested in his/her own sex and body and discovering that stuff - which many doctors / psychologist / sexologist would consider a natural and healthy thing - having bf/gf and being introduced to alcohol or drugs and dealing with school bullies is everyday school 101 - whether you like it or not. It is what it is and if you thik it's not you're either a stupid parent or an ignorant one. And don't you even try the \"oh the times we live in are...\"... We all had the same things 20 years ago in school, it's nothing new, stop acting like you're now shocked or discovering this thing for the first time. Drop it... you know, I know, but I guess admitting it is not an option for you all? People are just so touchy these days and they do YT videos about this (and of course for views cause drama and hate sells almost as good as sex and gambling) and could give it -1/10 if it was possible on review sites just to get in that sweet hate train that's passing by. To me it HILARIOUS! I'm white, straight, atheist middle age man, and I have no problem with any of the racist jokes, soft nudity, intimate scenes, LGBTQ+ themes or when they have a lolz from time to time on a more touchy theme... I really haven't heard ANYTHING that wasn't made fun of or shown in series like South Park or Family Guy (which are hilarious IMO). How many hate videos and boycotts about those two have you seen lately? In fact, compared to those two, Velma should be E rated. I think you have all forgotten that in the end it is - and Scooby has always been - a COMEDY show and you should all loosen your panties and just have some giggle and fun when you hear a stupid, cringe joke that doesn't really land the way it should instead of going on a YT, Twitter or FB rampage on how it's the worst thing in the history of TV shows...\n\nOh and BTW. In like half of the 20 or so videos I watched on YT about this topic the person who made it was so outraged and disgusted about all the racist jokes that they just couldn't shut up how Velmas skin was not white and her voice (as the whole show btw) was done by an \"Indian\" referring to Mindy Kaling who is in fact an American. So.... yeah... I swear to god the \"hate Velma\" club has the same people in it who think Andrew Tate is a top G. Both groups are equaly misguided.",
