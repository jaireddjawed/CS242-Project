I exercise daily (when not in pain) and eat relatively healthy. I harvested my big experiment back in November and that is when my back started to flare up - on my feet for 10+ hours a day, lugging buckets of soil, etc.\n\nSo now I’m beginning my bench work and data analysis. The constant sitting is making things worse. I am sleeping on the floor, constantly readjusting how I sit, etc. Anything to find relief. It’s getting to the point where I’m struggling to keep a grimace off my face during meetings. Having to TA two 3-hour labs where I’m in charge of lab safety and student questions is also terribly difficult right now, given the pain is distracting. I’m seeing doctors and trying to get this sorted out, but until it is fixed, I feel trapped. I’m not sure how to approach this with my advisor or with the professor I TA for, as I have tons of work to get done and of course need to meet the requirements for my TAship. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any tips on how to approach these conversations with your advisor? My advisor knows I have back issues, but I haven’t let in just how crappy it is.

        "text": "Background:\n\n\\- I got an MA in International Relations years ago that didn't help much with stable employment or pay, let alone any kind of \"dream job.\"\n\n\\- After a couple of years temping at nonprofits, I spontaneously applied to a supposedly \"more hands-on\" Master's in English at a small Midwestern grad program. I originally planned to take the certs in Technical Writing and TESOL in addition to the MA English.\n\n\\- Tech Writing curriculum sucked so I ditched it to focus on the TESOL stuff. Got the cert.\n\n\\- Came up with a pretty interesting, arguably quite relevant interdisciplinary thesis topic in summer 2021. Jumped several hoops to get approved for a thesis (vs non-thesis option), set up my committee, and get their nod for the thesis itself.\n\n\\- The interdisciplinary core of the thesis is the development of a sociolinguistics/applied linguistics research framework (ultimately research program or subfield) derived from global political economy. My third committee member I chose for their background in both international relations and linguistics/modern languages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n\\- After working on the thesis for about 16 months (pushing me into a sixth semester at this program), I submitted a third or fourth draft to my advisor thinking it would be the final draft (minus small tweaks) before going to defense. PS: I'm already back in a full-time job since the thesis is all I have left to do.\n\n\\- Advisor asked to get on a phone call (this was maybe late October / early November 2022). They said that a) the thing needed to be revised *again* (reversing some formatting changes they'd had me make before), and b) the other two committee members were getting cold feet after reading one of the early drafts and realizing it was way over their heads in terms of theory. They also had ongoing confusion (somehow) about what the thesis \"does\" - they were expecting something with an empirical conclusion as opposed to a research framework, even after I explained repeatedly what I was doing and why.\n\n\\- So it's now semester 7 waiting to graduate this program and I still have revisions to do. The committee, again, has cold feet and my advisor suggested I find a replacement for the third member, but this university doesn't have any strong grad programs in these other fields (IR, pol econ...) and I haven't found a prof in the directory who seems like they'd gel well with it. I keep having the nagging feeling that in my enthusiasm for the research I flubbed how to just get through what is ultimately a bureaucratic process. And I'm exhausted by the thought of revising this thing all over again when I've already gone back to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuture prospects: \n\n\\- At this point, it's a toss-up between (or maybe a combination of) project manager and TESOL instructor. In the first case I already have experience and working on credentials (CAPM cert) and in the second case I have some experience and the cert is in the bag. \n\n\\- I wanted to go PhD for a minute, but there are virtually no programs/faculties that would support this kind of research that are also accessible and affordable to me.\n\n\\- So is there any reason I should still try to graduate this ball-and-chain MA English (like to get a TESOL position at a university)? Or should I cut my losses and gently let down my advisor?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have questions or need clarifications. Thanks!",

He is a research faculty member and not (yet) on the tenure track. As a result, he has extended the opportunity for me to pick a co-advisor of my choice at the university.\n\nThe thing is that one of my main motivations to do my MS under this professor was because he is a strong supporter of doing practical research. As a result, I am doing lots of research where I can tinker with hardware and software rather than just running endless simulations and analysis. I have been doing a good job with this. However, with a PhD I understand that a lot of the work, however practical will involve a lot of theoretical analysis and therefore, I'm unsure what my motivations should be. I am quite excited at the prospect of working on a dedicated time towards a single area in my area of work. However, I'm not sure how to get around it - especially with an advisor who is not very experienced as a PhD advisor.\n\nAny points would help in how to think about this.",

        "text": "This post is part confessional, part critique of the US grad school system, but I've been reflecting on what has changed in the past 2+ years of starting grad school and working as a TA and my growing apathy about undergrads is probably the top one.  I'm hoping by sharing this I can warn new entrants, get some validation or constructive criticism from people already in, and perhaps advice from people who are almost done or have more experience in academia.  \n\nSome backstory: I started a social sciences PhD program at a Big Ten university in 2020, and my purpose was (and is) to get a PhD so I could be qualified to teach at the university level. Teaching was always my passion and aside from my subject expertise, I was (and am) very extremely interested in developing my pedagogical skills and keeping abreast of new developments in teaching strategies, technologies, and research. A lot of this was born out of a love for watching students grow and make connections or become passionate about the material. \n\nSo, I was delighted to receive my first teaching assistant assignment in my first semester and had hoped to practice some of these skills with my first TA professor. Granted, this was a grading position and not one teaching sections, but I was given the responsibility to come up with a large-ish assignment towards the end of the course. I quickly realized that my professor was very involved with their kids' afterschool clubs/activities and did the bare minimum for their classes - used recycled lectures from years ago with no new material, had me screen most student communications, basically just plowed through the lectures with no questions or comments, cancelled class or let out early whenever possible (and this was all-Zoom classes in peak covid). Moreover, I was learning the ins and outs of grading and was admittedly slow with grading the first few written assignments, but got the sense that my professor intended the grading process to be much more efficient--meaning much less student feedback, and in some cases not even word-for-word reading of their assignments. I tried to give really in-depth feedback and line edit my students' essays for the assignment I gave them but it became very clear very quickly that the expected turnaround time (and my other responsibilities) would not allow for that level of effort. Overall, that class put a huge dent in my optimism and motivation to be a standout TA. \n\nI'd be more inclined to chalk the negativity of that experience up to an unfortunate one-off combination of a low-commitment professor and the upheaval of COVID Zoom classes, but since then we've returned to in-person classes and I've had the chance to TA for four other professors, all of whom have been better than the first, and yet I still noted a diminished emphasis on grading/teaching quality in favor of speed and efficiency. In fact, the professors who have been the most kind and helpful to work with all encouraged me to reduce the amount of student feedback in order to focus on my other projects and research. Worse yet, I began to see this as not only necessary, but a desirable and even ideal arrangement. \n\nOne thing I wish I knew before I started grad school is the fact that there is literally not enough time in the day to finish all the things that you're handed, and while there are certainly things I didn't mind sacrificing or half-assing (like perfect grades or committee work and other service obligations), the fact is that if you want to finish, the ONLY thing that matters is your research and getting over the next hurdle to the next benchmark, so even the things that you love doing (in my case, teaching or taking interesting-but-not-critically-relevant classes) that are good and important must be sacrificed or half-assed as well. \n\nThere is one thing I care about a TON now that wasn't even on my radar before: other grad students. I'm incredibly grateful that I landed at a university with a strong student union and I've become extremely alert to labor abuses and issues that the other grad students face. The most important wins that our union has had over the years concern pay &amp; working conditions, so ironically, if I want to put in the extra time/effort to be the super TA I started out wanting to be, I'd be needlessly giving up the hard-won benefits our union struggled to get. But even with a solid student union, grad students at my university face enormous challenges and two people have left my cohort already, and I'd be lying if I said there wasn't an effect on my mental health. \n\nI'll confess that the title of my post is a little clickbaity, because I do care about the undergrads I help teach, but the way grad school is set up, I can't give them the effort and attention they deserve and that I want to give them. But if I'm going to do this as a career I need to prioritize finishing my program, even if it comes at the expense of the students I have now. I feel a little guilty about it, but that's an uncomfortable feeling so for now I'm content to lie to myself and say I don't care about my students. I'll make it up to the future students I teach when I graduate. And that's the Faustian bargain of academia.",

I love working with pathogens. But PUIs don't have BSL 2 labs... they often don't even have growth rooms (I work with plants too).   \n\n\nI recently reached out to a potential post-doc lab, and the PI straight up told me that if I want to work at a PUI, then I should not come to work in her BSL2 mouse lab. Am I going to have to choose between doing the kind of research I love and the institution where I work? My dream was to be able to give undergrads the experience of working in a lab to help them decide if they wanted to go to grad school. But my research is saying, \"go to an R1 and write grants for the rest of your life.\"   \n\n\nAm I thinking about this in terms that are too black-and-white? Does anyone have ideas on how to pivot from BSL2 plant-pathogen work to a PUI-level of research? Should I just accept that I will end up being at an R1 if I stick to this research?",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm considering returning to school to pursue an M.S. in a STEM field. I'd like to know more about undergrad grades versus industry experience when it comes to applying for grad programs.\n\nMy time in undergrad (engineering) was bumpy, and I ultimately graduated with just under a 3.0 GPA. Core class GPA was a bit lower. I went into manufacturing and now have 3 years of experience, including promotion to senior engineer &amp; some technical certifications. I've kept track of projects and milestones, and I have coworkers who can provide insight into my ability to learn / work. Finally, I plan to take the GRE. \n\nMy time working has helped me overcome issues that held me back in undergrad, and I believe that my GPA doesn't reflect my potential. I know I'll have to convince admissions though... How worried should I be about my 3.0 undergraduate performance?\n\nTIA for any input!",

Anyhow, our contract did not say it was a work stipend, but just a regular stipend not reliant on us actually logging work hours.\n\nAlong with that, we did not get the full amount we were supposed to be allotted last term. Everyone in the program is kind of frustrated about that, and I have direct contact with a member of our reagants board as he found the program and told a dear friend and mentor about it. So what do you think I should do? Should I subtly mention it to him tomorrow as I think he might be on campus or wait to see if they pay out the difference to us?",

However, the PI told me on day 1 of the rotation that the funding situation had changed for the worse and he couldn't commit to keeping me on longterm. I couldn't believe it because I had asked about this before rotating. No matter though, I can go back to lab #1 though right? NOPE, turns out that PI said almost word for word the same thing.\n\nI don't think this is about my performance since the #2 PI told me before I had even had a chance to do any work. Also, we have a group Whatsapp chat for our cohort and a lot of people are hearing similar things. One person's rotation PI said it is because there was a protest and stipends went up by a lot so PIs are now saying they can't afford to take new people on.\n\nI can't stop picturing the worst outcomes.

They're either just involved in the physics aspect or the physiology aspect.\n\nI had talked to a trusted lecturer about not being sure if I was someone who was able to do a masters (despite the fact that I'll probably qualify with a 1st I still worry about being able to cope with the workload). She was lovely about it but since then other lecturers that I deal with on a daily basis keep trying to inquire if I was interested in a masters and if I was they'd be particularly interested in being involved my research and they think I should work for 3ish years (which I was planning on doing) before doing a masters and presenting the research I'd be doing and how they'd be happy to offer a job providing I do qualify from my undergrad.\n\nI don't want it to sound like I'm up my own or that I'm not grateful but I can't help but feel like a lamb being led to slaughter. It just feels suspicious and I don't know why they're interested since the research I want to do isn't really their specific area of interest (i.e. some are interested in sleep studies and it's nothing to do with sleep studies)",

        "text": "TLDR: Former professors made a joke about me becoming their coworker after my PhD. Another one of their former students was upset she wasn't considered the first choice and thought it was because she had children. \n\n\nBackground: We are both PhD students in different departments at different institutions but did our B.S &amp; M.S at the same institution in the same department (let's say biochemistry) \n\nShe (late 30s?) did hers in 2004 (B.S.) and 2016(M.S.). Our department does not have a PhD program, so she joined a similar department (think biology) at the same institution in 2016. She has 4 kids, but I don't know much else about her at all. \n\nI know a few professors don't like her due to her attitude and work ethic. I'm not even sure who her M.S. advisor was and we are a small department (12 professors). No one seems to claim her. I overheard gossip that she isn't close to finishing her Ph.D. degree and probably won't finish ever. Since she's on year 7, no where close to done, and her advisor is out of money. I was also told that she hadn't done her quals before COVID. She might have done them by now but I don't know. Also she is a full time PhD student, not part time. \n\nThough even as a PhD student in another department, our old department did hire her as an adjunct for 101 and to be the central academic advisor for the department. So she is apart of the staff for our old department. I never had issues with her till now. \n\nI (mid 20s) was 2019 (B.S) and 2021(M.S.). I also was a dual major, and had a prestigious internship. I choose the nearby rival school for my PhD in the same subject (biochemistry). I'm frequently visit my old department because I'm running experiments or collaborating with 4 of the professors. \n\nStory: \nI was out at bars drinking with a group of professors (30s-50s) from our old B.S./M.S. department. This is fairly common since I graduated with my M.S. They do not drink with current students. This was the first time the other woman joined us. I think she had been out with them before when I wasn't around. \n\nSo the professors were teasing me about since I must love working with them, I should just be their coworker when I'm done with my PhD in a few years. It's not a new joke, they have said it before to me. It's a joke because: 1) It is well established that I want to work at a very specific national lab. 2) the department has no money to hire anyone for tenure track in the next few years. 3) I don't like teaching. So I always say \"No teaching, no teaching\" in the style of Arrested Development's \"No touching, no touching\" \n\nAnyways the woman was offended they were \"considering\" me over her for a job that doesn't even exist, and she was the coworker already so she should be consider first for a tenure track job. \n\nThe table was now tense, and someone diplomatically but firmly told her \"OP would have the more relevant degree since I would biochemistry and not biology.\" \n\nShe responded that \"You're only saying that because she doesn't have children. I would of had just as many opportunities as OP if I didn't have children. This is discrimination.\" \n\nTo which one of the women professors (who has 3 children herself) responds, \"atleast OP will actually get her PhD degree. Having children doesn't excuse piss poor work ethic and lack of talent.\"\n\nI was stunned but quietly and squeakily said \"I just want to work at [name of national lab].\" Because some reason I thought that would help?  \n\nAnd she stormed off. \n\nAnyways I hear she's bad mouthing me more than the actual professor who said that. I don't know if I can fix this or what to do. But she is staff there and I'm just a visitor. I come maybe 4-6 days per month. Though the few professors who I collaborate with told me not to worry about her.",

        "text": "As the title kinda says.. Just very anxious about the situation, and looking for any advice/support/stories etc, that might ease my anxiety. \n\nTldr; I'm a 2nd semester PhD student who just very recently started dating a fellow 5th year labmate who will be transitioning into the labs post-doc position this summer. Should I continue to persue this or stop? \n\nMy lab consists of two labs, A and B. I toured the lab last spring before committing to start this past fall in lab B, and during that time, I got the opportunity to hangout with both labs for the week. It was a blast. At the time I realized I really clicked with John (in lab A). Low and behold I developed a crush on him ever since. Before the fall semester, both labs attended a conference together, where I felt John and I grew closer. However, at this time neither of us were making any moves. I had zero plans to make any moves at all as I've seen previous labmate relationships fail and the aftermath was *awful* and that I'd never get myself into a labmate relationship because of this. So I just told myself all fall semester that I will get over him eventually. Then about half way through the semester a fellow friend in lab A who regularly talks with John mentioned that John might like me. This friend then proceeded to make sure that John and I hung out a lot at some game nights/concerts/Christmas dinner etc. Over break, John and I ended up hanging out one on one where we basically talked about us and what we were feeling and what we are to do about it. We both discussed our hesitations etc, but ultimately decided that the bond we feel together is undeniable so we will go slow and start dating. Fast forward to now, John found out he's secured funding for a post-doc in lab B. I knew this was a possibility as it was discussed at the conference, but now it's official official. Hell be defending in the spring/summer then become the labs (mostly B) post-doc, therefore my supervisor.\n\nIs this frowned upon for us to be dating/being bf/gf?\n\nWe both plan to be 1000% professional around each other when in the lab and such, but I'm just worried that this won't look good in fellow labmates eyes. Although I should preface that there is/was another couple in the lab and they going 4+ years strong and everyone loves them. So idkkk. I'm just very anxious about the situation.\n\nCan you share any similar stories and how they worked out?",

I worked hard for it and earned the degree by reasonable interpretation of quantifiable metrics, but also finished quicker than many of my friends who worked equally hard if not harder in that time. Now that I'm transitioning to a new job, I feel gross - like I owe them an apology. Since starting writing my dissertation I've felt guilty and I stopped talking about it altogether the last 9 months because one of the more senior students in my lab was notably harboring resentment about it. They ended up not attending the defense and while most of my friends did attend, I still feel like I'm at fault. \n\nI'm also struggling with personal meaning and accepting that it's over as well. I don't feel like a doctor, moreso someone who escaped.",

I work full time Monday through Friday, then go to class immediately after work several times a week. I plan my social life around this schedule and would never skip class to do something fun - go to a concert, out to dinner with friends, etc.\n\nLast semester I had a professor who rescheduled class from its normal time to a Friday night because there was a school-sponsored event he wanted to attend. I'd had plans to go out of town that weekend with tickets and hotels booked nearly a year out. I planned this trip specifically to not conflict with school, which was not easy. I told the professor I would not be able to make it if he rescheduled class for that specific Friday (there were other days he presented as options that I could have attended) and he proceeded to dock my attendance points and hold a very obvious grudge against me for the rest of the semester.\n\nAt my first class of this semester, I have another professor who already wants to cancel class and reschedule it for a Friday night. I have tickets to a show on that night that I bought months ago. I specifically bought the more expensive Friday tickets instead of the cheaper weeknight tickets in order to not miss class.\n\nAm I unreasonable for thinking this should not be a common practice? Like I'll go (reluctantly) if I don't have plans for the Friday night in question, but I am very annoyed and feel like our time is not being respected. I go to great lengths to make sure I can attend class during its normally scheduled time and don't like being made to cancel other plans.",

As my time goes on in this program I’ve realized it’s a horrible grad school program that diminished my passion for the field and as my time in my internship goes on I’m starting to realize this may not be the field for me. I’m considering “mastering out” but I’m not really sure of what that entails? I’ve received the credits but I’m not sure if my graduate school has to certify anything? I’m just confused on the “mastering out” part because I have the credits &amp; so on. \n\nTIA for any advice!",

On the other hand, as I read more about ADHD, I feel so overwhelmed, because firstly we know so little about it, and there seem to be few helpful strategies specifically for scientists with ADHD. I'm sure many of us struggle with ADHD, so I was wondering if a mentorship program just for students/postdocs/faculty with ADHD would be beneficial. I definitely think I would benefit from talking to someone with ADHD who has more experience with handling Academia as an ADHder. I'd love to hear your thoughts, and if this gains traction I'm happy to set up a mentorship program!",

The third Professor was nice but asked a ton of questions on the following steps to my research project (what to do after I see good results) that I could not answer. I was too focused on my research specifically and could not think well intuitively. There isn’t much to this post I just needed to vent.",
