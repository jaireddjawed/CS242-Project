Today, my Romanian teacher introduced me to a couple romanian students that came here to study at university, and she told us it would be good if we practised Spanish and Romanian together. I haven't really practised much conversation in the several months I've been learning Romanian, although I've been doing good in the classes and I'm fairly happy with my progress until now.\n\nNow, this might be a great chance for me to learn a lot of Romanian and for them to learn a lot of Spanish, since they are also beginners at the language. The thing is...I'm pretty terrified of doing so. They seem like nice people, but it's me I'm worried about. I guess I'm afraid they'll think I'm boring and that I'm not fun to hang around with... After all, they're the ones in the country of their target language, they can practise with anyone.\n\nDo you guys have any advices for me? How do you deal with this feeling? Do you have any strategies or anything to avoid language practise meet-ups being a disaster?",

For German I'm using [collinsdictionary.com](https://collinsdictionary.com) which I use as a normal dictionary, so usually I either create new cards while immersing myself or write them down to a file and revisit after some time. Recently I also started immersing into Japanese by reading manga - I use [jisho.org](https://jisho.org) and create flashcards immediately after seeing a new word.\n\nThis also works a bit differently when I'm reading on Kindle. I just highlight the words then and turn them into flashcards after some time, as it's just more convienient.\n\nNow, the problem I have is that none of these methods seems ideal for me. The method with creating flashcards on the run feels good, because I create them still having the context in my mind and I can even use the exact same sentences as examples. However, it slows me down and I enjoy the story less this way. It's also hard to perform when I'm not using my computer.\n\nOn the other hand, writing the words for later is fine, but the words tend to stockpile and then after some time I have many words to convert into flashcards, and that is just mundane, because of that I procrastinate and I create less cards this way. \n\nNow, how do you cope with that duality?

Of course, I quickly catch it and correct it immediately but it's such a bizzare rthing to happen. \n\nE.g. I know how to pronounce the word gato, i can pronounce it perfectly and yet, when I am not paying attention or just started my class, I'll find myself say it with long, english consonant. So embarassing when I know better and can do better and proper pronounciation of vowels should be automatic based on my native language and yet, I am finding myself in this bizarre situation. \n\nHave you had this happen? Never thought this would happen to me.",

I was thinking of learning a language to put on my CV to stand out more when I finish University, and I thought of learning Mandarin (as it's the 2nd most spoken language). But, I'm not sure I'd want to live in China.\n\nOn the other hand, I love Japanese Culture (I'm not a weeb or watch anime), Architecture, History and Cars. I could definitely see myself living/working there. But, on the other hand, their language isn't as widely used and could be kind of useless in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnother language I was debating was Russian, seeming as how prevalent it is in Cyber Security and the usefulness it could bring to any future jobs. \n\nWhich language would you guys recommend?\n\nThanks!",

I want to share my experience and encourage others to take the leap and learn a new language.\n\nFirstly, learning a new language opens up a whole new world of opportunities. You can travel to countries where the language is spoken and fully immerse yourself in the culture. You can also connect with people from different parts of the world and gain a new perspective on life.\n\nSecondly, learning a new language has many cognitive benefits. It improves memory, concentration, and overall brain function. It also helps you better understand your own language and appreciate the nuances of different languages.\n\nFinally, learning a new language is a rewarding and fulfilling experience. It requires patience and dedication, but the sense of accomplishment when you can finally communicate in a new language is incredible.\n\nI understand that learning a new language can be intimidating, but I encourage everyone to give it a try. Start small, with a few basic phrases, and build up from there. There are so many resources available, from language learning apps to language exchange programs, that there has never been a better time to start.\n\nSo, don't be afraid to take the leap and learn a new language. The benefits are endless, and the journey is worth it.",

It's set to block some apps and the entire internet during my study time except for [netflix.com](https://netflix.com), [wetv.vip](https://wetv.vip) and [iq.com](https://iq.com).

I used Fire Toolbox to set up the Kindle so it won't allow me to install new apps, and I also got rid of the web browser, mail and such. Pretty much the only other thing I can do with my Kindle is use Zoom and read books on the Kindle and Pleco apps.\n\nMy phone is set so it won't allow me to install any apps, and I've removed Safari, Mail and social media. For texting I almost exclusively use iMessage, which few people in my country use, so I receive very few texts a day, if any at all. All calls from unknown numbers are blocked. It's set to almost completely block itself every night.\n\nDuring my \"Chinese drama time\" I only use Netflix with Language Reactor and the Pleco dictionary. Language Reactor is set to hide translations unless I press the E key. Every time I find a new word/chengyu I look it up, and every time I have trouble linking sound to text I press the S key several times to repeat the line until (hopefully) I can make the connection.\n\nAfter my 2 hours of Chinese dramas, I usually bring my Kindle to bed and keep reading something in Chinese, or maybe something in English.\n\nI'm 2 weeks into this routine, and I feel I'm getting better and better at understanding the drama I'm watching.",

Because of this I set out with a friend to design a website that teaches languages in the most straightforward way possible for as little as possible. \n\nFor example, while other apps and websites focus on learning short phrases without providing context, we want to begin by teaching you the most used 1000 words in your target language. We also want to do this while providing all of the context you need in digestible pieces and up the difficulty to reading comprehensions and short stories as you progress. We also want to connect you with others at your level who can help you become more adept at your chosen language. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on this and I'd be happy to take any recommendations that can help us improve on our website over time.

I know this question got asked here a thousand times, but if you have a few seconds to help me please read through this post. \n\nMy native language is german and right now I am in my first semester at university. In school I learned english and french. Until tenth grade I didn‘t really put much effort into learning and my language skills were quite bad because my good grades in maths etc. kinda compensated for my bad grades in english and french. But as I got older I put more effort into school and my english skills got way better, right now I am between B2 &amp; C1 I‘d say. French on the other side was one of the classes I didn‘t continue after grade 9, so I was stuck athe very beginnings.\n\nOne year ago I have discovered Duolingo and started to improve my french. It really helped me but I got bored eventually so I looked for other languages. After a few months of Esperanto and a few weeks of Danish the Duolingo layout got changed and all my progress is messed up. I wanted to learn Esperanto because I read that it helps with understanding many fundamental concepts and thus improves your capabilities to learn other languages. I think it did help me and I am glad I put some time into it. I got into Danish because I will be in Denmark this year andI thought it would be nice to hold basic conversations. \n\nBut that‘s not enough of a reason to keep me motivated. The main reasons why I want to be able to speak another language is that my desired future job expects me to and I generally love to learn new things. But I think that a language like Danish is just too little to be very helpful later on. I want to be able to speak a language which is spoken in more than one country and which isn‘t too hard pronunciation wise. I think that Polish or Hungarian would be horrific for me. I know that Spanish fits perfectly into this scheme but honestly I am not very interested in spanish/latin american culture so I think Spanish would be a bad choice for me. \n\nDo you have any recommendations for me?\n\ntl;dr: I want to learn a language which is spoken in more than one or two countries and isn‘t very hard pronunciation wise",

        "text": "I had to think for a bit which flair to use, but I think ultimately this is a success I want to share (but I do invite constructive discussion too so please feel free to share your own similar experiences, ask follow-up questions, ...)\n\nYesterday evening, I came home from a weekend in the Netherlands. The main reason for this trip was to finally meet my Dutch friend, who had a book presentation on Saturday, and who spent Sunday afternoon with me. I arrived at my hotel on Friday around two, and left on Monday around noon-ish.\n\nFor some background: I've been chatting exclusively in Dutch with this friend for years now, semi-regularly, and during this time my Dutch apparently morphed from \"yeah okay, if I close one eye and look at it from a distance, I'd call it \"Dutch\", but with heavy German influence\" to \"I still notice some German influence here and there, and of course some mistakes, but you're really well-understandable by now\". I've also had the opportunity to listen to her speak via livestreams and short videos she's posted online (so I was somewhat familiar with her accent already).\n\nFriday:\n\nWhen I arrived, my brain somehow went into nervous overdrive from \"OMG I have to speak\" (vocal chord problems, speaking is problematic for me in general) and \"OMG I have to speak in DUTCH\", so of course my ability to string together some understandable Dutch, and my knowledge how to pronounce Dutch, just went bye-bye. During check-in, the receptionist almost immediately switched to German with me (I don't blame her one bit, she was doing her job, and being helpful, and my Dutch was awful in that situation). Needless to say, my confidence took a hit and I was wondering whether I had just been too nervous, or whether I had vastly overestimated my Dutch all this time.\n\nA bit later, I got ready to go out to explore the town, and look for where to grab dinner later. There had been info about some hotel program in my room that I wanted to inquire about, so when I came to reception, I asked about it. This time, the (different) receptionist started by asking me whether I spoke Dutch, and I replied that yes, a bit, and I'd like to try it in Dutch, so we had the whole conversation in Dutch (I felt less nervous, which immediately translated to somewhat better Dutch), and she even complimented me afterwards. Confidence somewhat restored.\n\nDinner at a really busy sushi place was a wild mix of Dutch, English, and German from both me and the waiters, which was partly due to noise levels, partly due to me being tired and slow with comprehension and thinking, and them being really busy.\n\nAll in all, Friday showed me that a) my language skills become absolutely awful when I'm nervous and not fully \"at home\" in a language yet, and b) my brain needs some time to adjust (ironically, it's still somewhat in \"Dutch mode\" now that I'm back in Germany, and keeps narrating my thoughts in Dutch, and I have to remind myself to NOT speak Dutch at home as no one else here understands it XD)\n\nSaturday:\n\nI had a surprise planned for my friend, a short speech (that another friend had proof-read for me in advance), but didn't know when during the presentation I would be called on stage for that (by another friend of hers, who was doing an interview, and whose help for this surprise I had enlisted). I have also always suffered from stage fright. So of course my nervousness was level 1000 and I was wondering which part of me had ever thought this was a good idea. I was still able to understand almost everything that was said, and when it was my turn, I was able to partly read, partly speak freely, my whole speech. I stumbled over my pronunciation a lot and had to force myself to slow down a bit, but apparently I was understandable enough. Phew! Vocal chords were angry with me when I returned to my hotel room, so I spent the rest of the afternoon and evening resting and reading. Not sure quite how I feel about my speech, I know that I would have just as likely stumbled over a German speech due to my sheer nervousness, but I'm very glad that I managed to do it as my friend was really touched, and just for that it was absolutely worth it.\n\nSunday:\n\nShe picked me up around noon and we started out with a nice walk around town before going to a nice café for brownies and tea. I told her that my voice was still angry from Saturday (and had warned her ahead of time that I might have to write/type to communicate) so I'd likely have to switch to writing at some point. My voice held out for a while, though, and we talked about all kinds of things, first all spoken, and then at some point I switched to typing. I definitely made mistakes but they didn't hinder communication, and we had a quite naturally-flowing conversation for almost four hours. It certainly helped that I felt at ease talking to her, so my nervousness wasn't a factor. I did run into a few situations where I felt like I couldn't fully express what and how I wanted to say something, but was able to get close enough that it wasn't really a problem. There were also a few times when I didn't completely understand what she was saying, but was able to get the gist of it so I didn't have to ask for clarifications or repetition.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nAll in all, I'm quite happy with my Dutch skills during that trip. Yes, I did have \"starting problems\" at first, and got yet another confirmation that nervousness just completely destroys my active language abilities, but once I got accustomed to Dutch, I felt quite at home (and got way fewer people randomly switching to German or English--I actually think no one did after Saturday afternoon). This trip, especially Sunday afternoon chatting with my friend for hours, has basically confirmed that my most recent self-evaluation at a B2 for speaking (chatting) was spot-on. It did feel like a comfortable and solid B2. Also, I just really really enjoyed hearing so much Dutch around me as I love this language!",

        "text": "[Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/opinion/english-immigrants-language.html)\n\nBy Ilan Stavans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Stavans is Lewis-Sebring professor at Amherst College and a consultant to the Oxford English Dictionary. He is the author of the forthcoming book “The People’s Tongue: Americans and the English Language.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe immigration debate often centers on who should be welcomed into our country. Some even argue that multiculturalism dilutes our national character — that the very the essence of the country is somehow vanishing. But far from undermining the American experiment, immigrants enhance our culture by introducing new ideas, cuisines and art. They also enrich the English language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs newcomers master a new language, they lend words from their native lexicon to the rest of us. For example, the English language, or maybe we should just call it American, has borrowed from others to name the foods so many of us love. Italians gave us pizza and spaghetti, and we borrowed taco, burrito and churros from the Spanish language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChinese immigrants introduced us to chopsticks, while the ketchup we drown our hot dogs, burgers and fries in is believed to have derived from a Chinese word. Irish immigrants introduced us to hooligan, phony and galore — and from Yiddish we got the words chutzpah and schlep. The terms diva, tornado and tycoon came from other languages, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScores of words are invented every day, while old words are pushed aside to make room for new ones. Some loans have a short life span; others become an essential part of our day-to-day. Their staying power can depend on the process of assimilation — the time it takes a group to enter the middle class and the connection that group retains to its origins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, American English hasn’t just borrowed heavily from those coming from distant shores. Words like kayak, chipmunk, tobacco and hurricane are derived from some of the roughly 300 Native American languages spoken by those who were here long before most of our ancestors arrived. More than half of America’s states owe their names to Native American origin. I think of the poet Natalie Diaz, who wrote:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManhattan is a Lenape word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven a watch must be wound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can a century or a heart turn\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif nobody asks, Where have all\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe natives gone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur nation’s founders would likely understand little of what we say today, given the amount of fresh acquisitions we’re always making. John Adams, our second president, was convinced that American English required a federally funded version of L’Académie Française in order to safeguard the people’s tongue from “going to the dogs.” He proposed, in 1780, a strategy to build one. But Thomas Jefferson, who sought to protect Native American languages and is credited with introducing words like belittle and pedicure into our lexicon, disagreed. He believed that a language has its own survival mechanisms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdams, fortunately, was on the losing side. American English is of, for and by the people, and its well-being depends on us. We do with it as we wish — or as we feel, since language is so often shaped by gut emotions. There are authorities within each language, of course, chief among them parents, educators, language scholars and dictionaries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen our foundational dictionary, Noah Webster’s “An American Dictionary of the English Language,” published in 1828 it only included 70,000 words. To be accepted into it, words must suit a specific criterion. Over time, it became Merriam-Webster, a commercial lexicon that now contains over 15 million examples of words. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive, as dictionaries in other languages might be. That is, Merriam-Webster doesn’t tell us how to speak. It’s the other way around: Native speakers and immigrants alike dictate what the dictionary should contain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Mexican immigrant myself, I am constantly amazed at how, in its 450-year history, American English has become stunningly elastic. It has recalibrated itself by learning from the past. It is essential that it continues to do so. Don’t give up your accent! Don’t lose your immigrant verbal heritage! As an immigrant myself, I find joy in hearing accents, particularly those by people who have mastered American English yet retain a beautiful trace of their native tongue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s important to note that speaking English hasn’t always been a choice for some. Immigrants are sometimes made to feel that they have to suppress their language in order to belong. Throughout history, children have been physically disciplined or discriminated against for speaking their native language.\n\nEditors’ Picks\n\nThe Fast and the Curious at &lt;span&gt;Formula 1’s&lt;/span&gt; Miami Grand Prix\n\nWhy I Watch the Closing Credits of Every Movie I See\n\nA Big-Wave Photographer Faces Frigid Water, Sharks and Currents to Get the Shot\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently stumbled on an episode of NPR’s “Where We Come From,” in which Emily Kwong, a third-generation Chinese American, discusses her quest to become comfortable with her Chinese self. Her father spoke Mandarin until he entered kindergarten, at which point he was forced to speak English. He explained how his need to integrate fueled his desire to become fluent, and he forgot how to speak his native tongue. In the process his family lost an important part of their cultural heritage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmily Dickinson thought that words start a new, discreet cycle of life the moment they are uttered. While American English can be perceived as a threat to the survival of other cultures around the world, within our country it is a force that helps to bind us together, even as ideological polarization pulls the other way. Immigrants help us reinvigorate our multitudinous language.",

I will be attending college to take Spanish when I finish my current degree. I am not a class room learner, I'm a hand on kind of person so I know I will struggle. I using using duo lingo to learn as much as I can and practice as much as I can so I can keep up in the classroom. What I'm afraid of, is learning wrong or not learning the right stuff that will make it harder in the classroom. Does anyone have suggestions for material that is good quality? I can use that will be beneficial before going to school? Thank you in advance.",
