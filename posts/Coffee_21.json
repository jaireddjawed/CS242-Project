I’d like to drink to reap the benefits, but I want to make sure I don’t become physically reliant on it.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated. God bless.",

Think of this as an AUA directed at the back room of the coffee industry.\n\nThis may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.\n\nIndustry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post \"I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.\n\nWhile you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.\n\nPlease keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from \"the experts,\" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here. For more general coffee questions, e.g. brew methods, gear recommendations for home brewing, etc, please ask in the daily Question Thread.",

That seems like a really small drink, particularly compared to an iced latte you'd get at a coffee shop (venti is 640g, for example).\n\nIf I want to get a larger size, do I really need to just repack and run another portafilter of fresh grinds? that seems like a lot of extra work, particularly at a coffee shop that cranks out these drinks. how do they do it?\n\nshould i run it longer to get more espresso out of the original 14g of beans?",

No follow up for a whole week.

So seeing as i'm never home when post delivers i just won't be able to pick it since it's not my name.\n\nI was so exhausted by this whole situation that i wrote back to them saying it was sent to the wrong person and that i no longer wanted to fight to get a working product. I told them that it wasn’t worth trying to send the component again with a corrected name.\n\nIt seems childish, but i'm dealing with death in the family as well as another company from which i got a lemon too, i just simply do not have any more mental strenght left to push forward.

        "text": "Coffee pods are a relatively recent invention that offer a practical method to enjoy fresh coffee. A pod is put into a coffee maker that is made specifically for their use to make a cup of coffee. A single cup of coffee is made after a cup is placed in the machine's designated spot. There are several advantages to this kind of equipment, and having one at the office is especially practical. Here are a few of those advantages.\n\n[A Chocolate Truffle Flavored Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/ox570xsxyxga1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=593254db727e57602740dfcd5bb3f5864ce25295)\n\nWhen utilising a typical coffee maker, you only receive one flavour or brand that will be consumed by many people. However, when it comes to flavour and strength, each individual in your company definitely has personal preferences. Since each person can select a taste and strength that suits them, this is not an issue with pods.\n\nAnother issue with the conventional method is that leftovers frequently lay around for a long time before going bad. Therefore, leftovers frequently go to waste. By employing a single serving approach, this issue is resolved because there are no leftovers and each person makes one cup. Every cup is made fresh, so you won't have to worry about getting stale coffee or question how fresh it is.\n\nOffering your staff such practical conveniences can be highly advantageous. The way you treat your employees can have an impact on their mood and morale, which can have an impact on how well they do their jobs. A [coffee pod](https://www.tworiversdirect.com/collections/coffee-pods) maker is a fantastic way to let them know how much you value their effort.\n\nFor additional information about [coffee pods](https://www.tworiversdirect.com/collections/coffee-pods) and other work-related topics including workplace stress, coffee pod is solution for office people.",

I prefer intensely bitter/earthy/caramel/nutty coffee but I'm having a very hard time finding any to my taste over here. By ANY chance, do any of you know of any producer here in Costa Rica that sells a coffee that fits my tastes?  \n\n\nI understand it's a pretty specific ask, but if there's a group of people with an answer to this, it's you guys.

        "text": "\nI received my coffee shipment on Sunday from Onyx (tropical weather and Ethiopia Chelbesa)\n\nA question for all: what grind setting would you recommend for both coffees on a Hario V60? I have a Baratza Forte AP that is calibrated to factory spec.\n\nIn reviewing some of their videos, I note they call for a 10 on the Baratza Encore for Tropical Weather (which I figure is the most analogous) and 13 for the Chelbesa. I did a little simple math to try to convert. Mathematically, a 10 calls for 3C on the Forte. I ground that, and it seems way too fine...closer to espresso than small grains of sand. I tried this yesterday on a Hario V60, and the result had some acidity but also a ton of tannin and tea like taste and a body that was a little watery (which seemed counterintuitive given the concentration and extended brewing time due to finer grind but maybe a channeling issue?).\n\nToday I tried Tetsuya method on 8M setting which yielded better results but still mostly acidic with a lighter body (though the coffee did evolve more and felt more full). The taste is akin to tropical fruits but underripe fruits. I’m not hitting many of the notes suggested by onyx. I’d note that even at 8M with Tetsuya I finished drawdown at 4:15, so maybe need to grind coarser…? Super frustrating thus far but I guess part of the process.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for the Forte AP? I'm assuming that even though the grinders are from the same company the burrs must differ in some way that is causing the math to not be a linear relationship.",

I have ground my beans to both the 5 and 10 (lowest settings) on my breville smart grinder. Is there something I'm doing wrong or do I have to adjust the machine somehow? Cheers.",

I tried sleeping sitting up, figuring it would help because lying down made it slightly worse. I woke up about an hour later DRENCHED in sweat and feeling super sick to my stomach. I wonder if it's because i had coffee in the evening and went to bed only a few hours after. Either way, this sucks, and i can't from the pain!",

However, since giving up caffeine I haven't been able to find a single-origin natural process **decaf** that matches the fruit flavor of caffeinated counterparts. Maybe it's something to do with the decaffeination process or maybe roasters just tend to roast their decafs darker because that's what the average coffee drinker wants. Even third wave roasters who offer a great variety of beans tend to offer one variety of decaf at most. Has anyone here found what I'm looking for?",

        "text": "I just pulled my first espresso on my new equipment.  Hell, my first shot ever actually.  Never done this before.\n\nI am using a Gaggia Classic Pro.  My grinder is a Eureka Mignon Silenzio.  \n\nI won't be testing anymore tonight but I wanted to have the machine set up in accordance with the manual.  Once that was done, I couldn't help myself but to try to make an espresso.  \n\n  \nI had done a lot of research and knew everything I needed to do.  Now I am trying to figure out what needs to be adjusted and learn if I am correct in what I think.\n\n  \nSo I started with 17 grams of coffee ground pretty fine, I could make fingerprints in it and so I started there.  I put those 17 grams of coffee in the basket, used one of those little whisks to even it out and then I tamped it as evenly as humanly possible with some pretty decent pressure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI loaded it up into the machine and placed my scale and cup under it ready to go.  Now from what I learned you are aiming to get double the weight of the grams you put in.  So if you do 15 grams of coffee grounds you want 30 grams of coffee out and if you do 17, you want roughly 34 grams out.  Give or take of course, this is something that can be adjusted to taste, but I am trying to get a baseline.\n\nAnyways, from what I have read you want the brew process to take between 20 and 30 seconds.\n\nWell, when I pushed that brew button, within about 5 seconds I had pulled double the weight of the grounds.  \n\nMy first thought is I have ground my coffee way to fine.  The water is going through much too fast. But I am also wondering if I put enough pressure when tamping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe puck was perfect after the shot though.  Not soggy and came out uniformly and I could see that at the very least it appeared properly extracted with no dry spots or anything like that at all.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I use a courser grind?  Or stick with the grind and try more tamp pressure?  Or have I not thought of something else?  Thanks in advance.",

The dose was 15.1 grams, the grind was set at 120(saw it recommended online) when I went to pull my shot today the lever was so hard to press that I couldn't keep the pressure even (also I'm a noob with espresso) and the shot was pitch black when coming out the bottomless portafilter as well as in the cup, there was no crema and at first it tasted quite sweet(with a lingering pleasant bitter finish) but as I continued to sip it it turned quite sour. My guess is that i ground too fine causing the super hard to pull lever and the fluctuating pressure caused the sour notes, but since it is my first machine I am not really sure.🤷 Does anybody have any ideas other than maybe trying to grind coarser? I used a thinish thermometer to break up clumps and distribute the grounds and tamped firmly with the tamper that came with the machine I didn't time the shot and forgot to weigh the shot so I don't have the time it took or the weight of the shot.",

I know Onyx does, but they haven't been good to me recently. \n\nOr maybe roasters who usually offer coffees from the countries that produce them. I know Nicaragua is a big producer, but most of the roasters I follow have stocked this origin for a good while now.",
