        "text": "Tldr; this is not a rant about comprehensible input, but an overarching concern that those affected by receptive bilingualism or practical language learners don't have as many tools/guidance as either the talented language learners vs the academic bookworms. I feel that we have reached this non-social/digitized era of DIY language learning culture, similar to gaming and  online dating. Instead of learning the basics and going out and speaking/interracting with REAL people, we are relying on the internet and movies. It has now reached to where we have createded a situation by where more heady, academic learners are beginning to refer to themselves as \"silent polyglots\"- these so-called YT polyglots who understand many languages via comprehensible input, yet can't speak but a few rehearsed phrases in their target languages. \n\nFor reference, i come from a family of whom many have the ability to learn languages rather quickly- the old school way of college and socializing. My father and aunts have all taken up 3 languages after moving to the US from France, simply by having to communicate with family, significant others, and their work spaces. They each know 5 languages and speak all of them fluently throughout the day in the south Florida/NY area- with neutral accents. Myself, i understand and read French, but have a horrible time with grammar aka conjugation and sentence structure. However, i can go to France and never use a single word of English simply by haven been around family and occasionally hearing French from only 1 side of my family. \n\nI feel that for many self-taught language learners who seek online guidance, it is constantly beaten into our heads that traditional classroom language learning is ineffective. However, my problem with learning from the online language community is that many of these folks are self taught linguists of who many do not know how to teach language learning, much less teach at different leveIs. Furthermore, i see quite a bit of introverted, heady academics who are simply in love with the academic approach vs the functional approach to language learning. While i do appreciate their contributions and abilities to share their experiences, i feel that there is a subset of language learners who are highly neglected, specifically those who are passively fluent in several languages such as myself. One may say that this is a \"you problem\", but i would argue that there are similarly many, who have either been exposed to a foreign language their entire lives, or have been stuck in the comprehensible input phase, but can't crossover into the output phase. A quick Google search will result in many people asking how to overcome receptive bilingualism, but are met with anecdotal experiences and told to simply \"practice\" in the mirror. Like, really?!? \n\nThen there are those who are also like me, who work as contractors and spend between 15 - 36 months in various countries. We can't afford years of short stories, but rather we need to be able to communicate effectively and immediately with the local economy in a way that is slightly beyond ordering food and asking for directions. We need to engage in meaningful, functional conversation, even if it is at the mercy of fossilization and developing bad habits. At that point, who cares if you are fluent or have the utmost proper usage of pronunciation? We are told to not worry about mistakes when speaking, but then we are warned about not speaking too early? The online language learning community often reminds me of the dog training community by where they tell folks not to purchase a dog unless you have time to play with/walk your dog for at least 1-2hrs every day (not included potty walks). \n\nThe issue i have is that when it comes to CI, there are tons of FREE material and guidance on how to receive input. Whether it's via Chrome extensions, TL vs native subs, flashcards, free online programs, etc... When it comes to output, there is this expectation to simply go out and speak, or pay a tutor. It seems like all things social have gone digital for some odd reason. The advice is that if you don't have enough output, do more reading and speaking will kick in naturally. We are also advised to simply to go out on our own and find what \"works best for you\". But wait, where is all the guidance that the online introverted CI folk have? Why do we have to go out and fend for ourselves unlike the bookworms? As for me, i finally decided to take some overseas jobs this year and currently living in Turkey, moving to either Austria or Germany next. However, I have just been watching movies and reading short stories in French in getting ready to visit family in France.  The problem is that i already understand 90% more of what i read due to CI over the past 6 months, but as I said, I speak like a mature 7 year old. I'm also frustrated that i can't even order at a Turkish restaurant because i chose to spend my time working on French, but German is also eminent- since I'm here for only a few more months. I wanted to get German started at first, since i have a leg up on French, but didn't want to compromise myself. \n\nThat said, meaningful CI does work over time. My issue is that meaningful output strategies are non-existent online, especially when i don't have the time on CI for years. Instead of giving us practical solutions and demonstration, these academic bookworms explain the \"reasons\" for not being able to speak in order to extend their content for views. \n\nAll that said, the issue is that despite all of these discussions and debate on comprehensible input vs output, everyone has their own interpretation of krashens' work in how or what he meant to say regarding comprehensible input. Regardless of the true interpretation, it still leaves those who suffer from receptive bilingualism, or working travelers with not as many tools/guidance as the academic types who have years to engage in reading tons of novels. \n\nThe question becomes- what are practical strategies that apply to receptive bilingualism at my stage that may not necessarily apply to others? (other than go out and speak). Do i pay for an online tutor? When i get to Germany, do i take traditional classes for basic comprehension, then move on to CI? Do i create a flashcard stack of the 300 most common phrases? \n\nAgain, not a rant, just a concern for a more functional approach to language learning.",

        "text": "Sorry if I'm posting this incorrectly I haven't used Reddit much so I still don't know how it works.\n\nI've grown up speaking English and Arabic as my parents are immigrants and Arabic is their native language. My relatives mainly only speak Arabic so that's why I kept learning it but I'm struggling lately.\n\nI've been studying it most of my life, took exams a few years ago and after that I basically stopped studying. I only really use Arabic when talking to my relatives who I see once a year/2 years so my speaking tends to get really rusty in between, so usually I do a bit of self-teaching to refresh my memory before we visit them (and it's mostly basic conversational stuff).\n\nI haven't practised in like a year so my speaking has seriously deteriorated lately. I recently decided to start studying with a tutor instead of self-teaching so I can finally become fluent and not just use basic conversational stuff but I found my motivation has completely disappeared these past few months and I kinda hate studying it now. I think it's because I feel like I'm making no progress at all and honestly I feel kinda dumb for still not being fluent despite studying it for so long. My parents keep insisting I practise speaking with them to improve but I feel so stupid and embarrassed whenever I speak and make mistakes I just switch back to English. My tutor also reassures me it's okay to make mistakes but idk I just get extremely anxious talking in Arabic now when this has never really happened to me before\n\nI used to be so motivated and excited to learn it but now it just makes me depressed tbh so if anyone has any tips or advice I'd really appreciate it. We're going to see our relatives in summer so I think the pressure of becoming more fluent by then is getting to me (they tend to tease me for making mistakes and it's starting to become really hurtful ngl I just want to become fluent so they'll stop)",

I'm finding conversations with native speakers to be easier and easier these days, but I've noticed I still struggle when watching TV shows and movies. I'm wondering- why is this? Is it normal? And what can I do to improve? I imagine I just need to keep watching TV shows, even though I don't fully understand. Perhaps some dubbed shows that I have seen before so that I know I have context regardless. Does this seem like a good plan? Thank you for any input!",

The videos are 5 to 10 minutes long and I can easily incorporate them into my study routine.  I think this is going to be way more effective than using flashcards.  Also, I have reached a point where I want to start weaning myself off of flashcards and switching to native content as my primary means of language acquisition, so this helps toward that goal too.\n\nThis a niche interest, but here is a link on the off chance someone else would use this [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guFf1v2zLJ8&amp;list=PLNbNLuXIe7-ITn-F7JtxRDdO1hpSokLWY&amp;index=2) .

What methods you use and how you strategize when teaching yourself? What was the first priority when starting of on this journey?\n\nI've learned english since I was around 11 years old from school and the country I'm living in is very exposed to the english language in general by movies, tv-series, social media, computer games and so on. This makes me claim that I know english very vell in my adult life at least, but it also makes me wonder what the best way/form/method or whatever it is to learn a language from scratch are? I can't  really remeber what and how I started learning the english language from scratch, because it has been more than a decade long journey! \n\nI wouln't claim to be trilingual even though I've studied both french and italian in high school, for the sole reason that I can't really communicate through it (and also forgotten a lot of it). \n\nWhile writing this post, I can't count on how many YouTube videos I've seen whereas a polyglot has explained on how to learn (and obviously also try to sell their perfect language learning product). Some may suggest learning the 100 most basic words in the targeted language, then gramma is the perfect method. Others may claim that the best way is to acquire a language like a toddler would. The point is, I've heard so many different ways on \"how to learn a language\" and  it's starting to confuse me, which is why i'm asking the community for advice!\n\nI wanna know how you as an indvidiual did to learn a language from scratch\\`? Did you just start learning the 100 most basic words, only learn phrases or start heavy with grammar? So, what was your method? Your exposure of the language? Your plan? Your strategy?\n\nThanks and hoping for many useful replies, because I really wanna start learning italian again! :D",

Without sounding really boastful, I think I have a natural ability for languages (I didn’t study that much and scored 90% with zero familial links to any foreign languages), and I really don’t want to waste what I have learned. \n\nCould I reach fluency from where I am now (good grammatical knowledge, pretty good vocab etc.) purely through watching YouTube, reading French content online and then practising with French speakers on discord once my comprehension has improved?

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've developed a small tool, [Lute](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute) (\"Learning Using Texts\"): a free, open source PHP-Apache-MySQL project for learning languages through reading that you install on your personal machine.  Here's a [brief demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjSqQTwUFCY).\n\nLute is a complete rewrite of the core features of [LWT](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt) (\"Learning With Texts\"), and is basically a stripped-down version of [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com/), which is the company headed by the great polyglot [Steve Kaufmann](https://www.youtube.com/@Thelinguist).\n\n(_Side note_: I used LWT for a short while and contributed big changes to it.  I wanted a few key features that neither it nor Lingq had, but forcing them into the unstable LWT codebase was extremely tough!  Unfortunately LWT needed a complete re-architecture and rewrite, and the maintainers weren't ready to make drastic changes.  I had some cycles, and so implemented this MVP -- minimum viable product -- for my own use, using more up-to-date tech.  There's notes about that in the [docs on GitHub](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/tree/master/docs).)\n\nLute is free. :-)  And open source, so if any devs want to hack on new features, that would be super as well.  It would be gratifying if it were useful to others as well.\n\nThis is the first public announcement of Lute, and while I've tried to make the installation docs clear, there might be some hiccups.  If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.\n\nCheers and best wishes to everyone!\n\njz\n\n* GitHub: https://github.com/jzohrab/lute\n* Demo: [Introducing Lute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjSqQTwUFCY)",
