Loved the series, thought it was phenomenal, but don’t think I can ever revisit it",

Is there something else that drives these decisions?",

It's about a young girl who is the daughter of a reporter, and spends her time investigating and reporting on things. Although the focus is more on reporting than solving, it reminds me of the Encyclopedia Brown(/etc) books I used to read.\n\nIn the first few episodes she investigates a possible murder, and a missing person's cold-case(/false imprisonment). Still, it's lighter than the other shows I have found myself watching lately.\n\nI'm suggesting the show, and would welcome any similar shows to watch, but also wondering:\n\n-How much of it is based on a true story?\n\nIt doesn't have to be true at all, to be interesting, but I know that some people (like the person I'm watching it with) enjoy true stories more than others. I'd like to be able to tell them what it's based on, which I'm sure I could google, but then I wouldn't be able to also suggest the show and hear what people thought of the series/seasons. (Apple only just pushed it to me, so I thought it was a new show until I searched the sub for past posts about it.)",

        "text": "The early to mid-2000s were a great time for the Sci-Fi Channel. After going through a style rebrand at the end of 2002 (debuting with their fantastic mini-series Taken), they started showing [commercials](https://youtu.be/ywb57BGLJNs) and [teaser promos](https://youtu.be/X-rlgyeAZBk)for their upcoming Children of Dune, a sequel to their miniseries of the first book.\n\n\nI think I can speak for most Dune fans by saying this sequel was a solid adaption of Frank Herbert’s work, and still holds up two decades later. John Harrison, who wrote and directed the first miniseries, returned to write Children. His ability to both write a compelling drama appealing to new fans and keep the complex story and core themes of the books present shined through just as strongly as he did with the first one.\n\n\nHarrison combined the second and third books into one show, giving us a series showing (spoilers for anyone looking forward to this year’s Dune: Part 2) &gt;!both the fall of Paul Atreides and the rise of his son, Leto II to take the reins of the Golden Path!&lt; without having to wait years between the two stories for the next adaptation. With a 4.5 hour runtime, Children of Dune had plenty of time to let the story of the two books breath without having to drastically cut plotlines or characters.\n\n\nThe first mini-series was praised for its faithfulness to the book, but heavily criticized due to the low budget showing through the effects, costumes, and sets. Children of Dune improved in every aspect, giving us a darker and [moodier series](https://youtu.be/DVC4QWwDaDc) with an outstanding musical score, including highlights like [Summon the Worms](https://youtu.be/mtcnt_VkvGU) (which was used in movie trailers for years after) and the beautiful [Inama Nushif](https://youtu.be/1NSYZCAZgIw). Thankfully several actors were able to [reprise their roles](https://youtu.be/J2xjQbd4qRY) from the first one, and everyone stepped it up to the next level.\n\n\nWhile the “Who was the best Paul?” debate will always happen, Alec Newman’s performance here specifically will be hard to top, should Denis Villeneuve get this far (I know he’s said he wants to film Messiah). James McAvoy, still pretty unknown at the time, did a fantastic job as Leto II. Ten years ago [I asked a Sci-Fi exec](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c56s6/iama_senior_exec_at_syfy_and_were_about_to_launch/c9d483m/) about why they never continued with more Dune, and he said there *were* discussions about it, but it just never materialized. I’m just grateful the Sci-Fi channel got halfway through the books, and Children of Dune remains one of the crown jewels of that network, and I will absolutely be watching it today to celebrate its 20th anniversary.\n\n\nThe entirety of Children of Dune and the previous Dune mini-series are on YouTube, and both are absolutely worth watching for their faithfulness to the books.\n\n\n*”The saga of Dune is far from over…”*",
