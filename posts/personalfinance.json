[{"title":"Banking Megathread: FDIC, NCUA, and your cash","author":"dequeued","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11pukuy\/banking_megathread_fdic_ncua_and_your_cash\/","text":"# What's happening with Silicon Valley Bank?\n\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) is a commercial bank that provides services to startups and entrepreneurs. Over the last several years, startups deposited an unprecedented amount of money into the bank ($189b) and SVB purchased a large amount of long-term bonds with those deposits. As interest rates have gone up, the market value of these long-term investments fell. Meanwhile, venture capital funding has tightened so startups have been withdrawing more and more money held by SVB.\n\nThe result is that SVB was sitting on a very large unrealized loss right when the pace of their customer withdrawals increased. To address this, SVB announced a fire sale (i.e., selling long-term bonds at a loss) to raise cash, protect their long term assets, and improve their financial health metrics. Investors and venture capitalists were concerned about these actions and that concern very quickly turned into a \"bank run\" as companies overwhelmed the bank with withdrawals and the FDIC had to step in.\n\nOn Sunday March 12th, a [joint statement by the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC](https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy1337) confirmed that the FDIC will complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank failure in a manner that fully protects **all depositors**. Depositors will have access to **all of their money** starting Monday, March 13.\n\nAs news of the SVB failure came out, people raised concerns about some other banks being exposed to similar risks, which is likely why the joint statement specifically details a similar resolution for Signature Bank, New York, New York. Signature Bank was closed March 12th by its state chartering authority. All depositors of Signature Bank will similarly be made whole.\n\n# FDIC and NCUA insurance\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) are responsible for insuring deposited funds in the event that a financial institution fails. The FDIC provides federal insurance for bank accounts and the NCUA insures credit union accounts.\n\nWhen the FDIC or NCUA steps in due to a bank run, they typically take control of the affected financial institution. The FDIC or NCUA may attempt to sell the bank or credit union to another institution or liquidate it, depending on the situation.\n\nRegardless of the resolution, depositors are protected up to certain limits. For example, the [FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category](https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/resources\/deposit-insurance\/brochures\/deposits-at-a-glance\/). The [NCUA has similar protection limits](https:\/\/ncua.gov\/support-services\/share-insurance-fund).\n\nNPR's All Things Considered did great story, *[Anatomy Of A Bank Takeover](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2009\/03\/26\/102384657\/anatomy-of-a-bank-takeover)*, describing how quickly the FDIC acts in these situations.\n\n# How does this affect me?\n\nIf your company uses Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, your company may have short-term issues with payroll and other short-term cash needs, but these payments should be able to resume processing as soon as tomorrow.\n\nIf you were a retail customer of SVB or Signature Bank, it's time to find a new [bank or credit union](\/r\/personalfinance\/wiki\/banks_and_credit_unions). The bank website will have more information on how to access your deposits so you can move your money to another financial institution.\n\nFor everyone else:\n\n- If you're well under the FDIC or NCUA coverage limits or are otherwise protected, you don't *need* to do anything, but it can be helpful to keep some cash in a second financial institution. Even absent a bank failure, it's possible to be temporarily locked out of an account for various reasons, banks sometimes experience technical issues, etc.\n\n- If you have more than $250,000 cash, even if it is only a short-term thing (e.g., after selling a home and before buying a new home), then read the below section on how to insure more than $250,000 in cash.\n\n# What about my brokerage?\n\nFirst of all, brokerage accounts are *not* suitable for your cash savings (although investing cash into some types of low-risk securities is relatively safe, see below for more information). Use an FDIC-insured or NCUA-insured account (anyone remember [this megathread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/a69km8\/update_robinhood_checking_and_savings_may_not_be\/)?).\n\nBrokerage firm failures are rare, but when they happen, SIPC protects the securities and cash in your brokerage account up to $500,000. The $500,000 protection includes up to $250,000 protection for cash in your account to buy securities ([source](https:\/\/www.sipc.org\/for-investors\/introduction)). Note that SIPC insurance does not cover losses due to any decline in the value of securities in your brokerage account.\n\nFinally, bear in mind that fully-paid brokerage assets are segregated from the brokerage's assets per securities law. SIPC insurance is generally only necessary if the brokerage firm is committing fraud by misappropriating customers' assets. You can read more about the historical track record of SIPC asset recovery at https:\/\/www.sipc.org\/about-sipc\/history.\n\n# How can someone insure more than $250,000 in cash?\n\nThis is not exactly an everyday problem for most people, but there are several ways to fully insure large amounts of cash.\n\n## Use multiple banks\n\n1. The manual approach. This might be impractical for corporations, but in most areas, the amount of cash coming from a home sale (for example) is generally not so high as to require more than a few banks. Even if you are well under the FDIC limits, having accounts at two different financial institutions is useful for backup purposes.\n\n2. Several banks and cash management accounts will automatically spread money across multiple program banks which allows their customers to effectively increase their FDIC insurance coverage beyond the $250,000 limit. While these accounts try to make sure less than $250,000 is kept at any partner bank, they all clearly state that the customer is ultimately responsible for monitoring that their assets at each bank don't exceed FDIC limits (for one thing, they don't know whether you have another bank account elsewhere that is deposited at one of the same banks). If you're using this method, verify that your deposits are spread out properly. Here are several options:\n    - Betterment: Allows FDIC coverage of up up $1m ($2m for joint accounts)\n    - Fidelity Cash Management: Fidelity doesn't specify an exact limit, but states that deposits beyond $3m may be deposited into non-insured money market funds.\n    - Wealthfront: Allows FDIC coverage of up to $2m for cash deposits\n\n3. One popular solution for \"big money\" is [IntraFI](https:\/\/www.intrafi.com\/), formerly known as CDARS (Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service). IntraFI uses a network of banks to (relatively) seamlessly spread deposits across multiple banks, which effectively increases FDIC insurance coverage well beyond the $250,000 limit.\n\n## Use multiple account ownership categories\n\nRemember that thing about \"per depositor\" and \"per account ownership category\"? Well, if you have a joint account, it's a different ownership category and it's $250,000 per co-owner. If you're married, that's an easy way to protect $1,000,000 in cash simply by using two separate individual accounts and one joint account.\n\n## Add Payable-on-Death (POD) beneficiaries\n\nYou can also increase your deposit insurance by adding living POD beneficiaries to your account. A single-owned bank account with 5 living beneficiaries has $1.25 million of insurance. See https:\/\/edie.fdic.gov\/ for more information. Note that PODs generally take precedence over wills and other estate planning documents.\n\n## Private insurance\n\nSome banks also provide additional coverage through third-party insurers, but this is a less commonly used option than spreading deposits across multiple banks.\n\n## Invest into low-risk securities\n\nAnother option is to consider investing some of the cash in low-risk securities such as Treasury bills, which are backed by the U.S. government and considered extremely safe. You can also invest into US Treasury money market funds, Prime money market funds, and ultra-short duration Treasury ETFs, particularly now that these options pay higher rates and Treasury-only money markets are state tax-exempt. While these options are not FDIC-insured, they are considered relatively safe and may provide an alternative way to spread your risk.\n\n---\n\n*Thanks to \/u\/karivara and other commenters on [this thread from \/r\/OutOfTheLoop](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OutOfTheLoop\/comments\/11n88pd\/what_is_the_deal_with_silicon_valley_bank\/) which helped bring me up to speed along with various news sources.

I immediately took action by notifying my bank about those charges as  fraudulent charges and filed a claim, I filed a police report and I looked up the merchant who the charges were made out to and wrote them an email notifying them about the fraudulent activity taking place and advised them to investigate the matter and provide me with any related information regarding the account if possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI filed a police report and provided the police with all the charges and information I had and got a police report number that I relayed to my bank claims specialist to include in my claim. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe wells fargo bank representative assisting me with the claim filed a fraud claim with me over the phone including all the charges totaling $17,450 and advised me that wells fargo will freeze the account and make sure nothing else gets charged to my account, I was given a reference# referencing the freeze and instructed me to make an appointment with a banker to set up a new account with a new account number. I was advised that the bank will investigate the matter within 10 business days and if more time is needed they will issue a temporary credit for the disputed amount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn February 22nd, I logged into my account and noticed 21 new transaction totaling $6,800 charged to my account from the same merchant dated 02\/21 and 02\/22 after I was given a reference # for the \"freeze\" on my account. I was devastated and called the bank to inquired about the new charges given that my account was supposedly frozen I was given someone else to speak to that seemed to have no knowledge about the freeze or what's going on then transferred me to online banking who also had no idea about the freeze, gave me misleading information and transferred me back to the claims department where they asked me the same questions as if I am starting the whole process from scratch.

I asked to escalate the claim where I was asked to provide the same supporting documents of the police report and the explanation of the fraudulent charges I already provided before. At that point it became obvious I just keep getting the run around and thrown to someone else that asks me for the same things that I provided to the previous specialist causing a disfunction on the progress of investigating the matter resulting in bogus conclusions to not honor their wells fargo \"zero-liability\" protection policy against fraud related matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI Just filed a complaint with CFPB.

So a bit more money in my pocket. \n- I\u2019ll gain private sector experience and perhaps learn more than I\u2019m learning now. This\u2019ll help for applying for future jobs. \n\nCons:\n\n- Career lateral move. Will be doing similar stuff in new job as in current job. \n- Harder and Higher stress.

CEO states they are \"optimistic\" about us eventually recovering all of our assets (although I doubt they were insured) but they admit they have no timeline there.  They say they are going to our investors seeking additional bridge funds but our investors are groups that invest in startups and we probably aren't the only ones pounding on their door right now.\n\nI am unsure what to expect here. Normally I would be paid on the 15th but I am thinking due to this I will not be. I can weather that missed pay but not having any idea about how long this will go on for has me concerned. I like the startup I'm in and don't want to abandon ship but the finances of a Series B startup are precarious and so far we have no revenue (though we are getting close it will still take time).  So if we are truly locked out of our funding for an indeterminant amount of time I imagine that could sink the whole company.  Our companies burn rate is probably 1 to 2 million a month so things could go wrong fast. I wonder if sitting back doing nothing and assuming it will all work out would be a mistake.\n\nNot used to this obviously. Anyone with insight into the banking world have any clue as to what to expect here? I understand no one knows for sure but some general predictions of likely future events sure would be nice.\n\nEDIT UPDATE: This morning our CEO confirmed 100% of our funds with SVB were as a depositor (ie not as a creditor) and therefore with the FDIC action we should be getting 100% of it back today.  That said because this is via a quickly put up website that everyone is now flooding it hasn't happened yet. So still possible that the actual process will take more time than just 12 hours we should get our funds back quickly. Our next payday is the 15th so whether or not this will cause a delay there is yet to be seen depends on how quickly we get our funds.  I can update on the 15th how it panned out.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678576418.0},{"title":"Career growth at a single employer vs. company-hopping","author":"bakery93","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11q9rae\/career_growth_at_a_single_employer_vs\/","text":"Curious about other\u2019s career experiences staying loyal to an employer vs. company-switching for better opportunities & more pay.\n\nI\u2019m aware that taking jobs outside of one\u2019s company generally result in higher salaries however, I\u2019ve spent my entire 8 year career with a single firm, averaging over a 15% pay increase YoY.\n\nIs this an outlier case or should I float the idea of exploring external opportunities from time-to-time?

We have been looking to buy a home in the next year or so regardless, but were hoping to wait for interest rates to come down a bit. \n\nThere's a home that's sentimental to our family and owned by extended family (who we are close with, the house is also paid off). It is potentially coming up for sale sooner than we'll be ready to buy, and needs about $50,000 in repairs. House has already been inspected and we're very aware of what all needs to be done, the $50,000 is what needs to be done in a timely fashion (next 6 months or so). They are hoping to keep it in the family as well so we're exploring options to make it work for everyone. \n\nOne of my ideas was to have them take out a home equity loan which we'd cosign on, and then arrange a rent to own situation...then when we're ready in the next year or so, we buy the house from them which includes the home equity loan on top of purchase price. This way the renovations process can start, we're paying in so they don't have additional financial burden, and there is a plan for us to take on the house as soon as we're ready. \n\nMy understanding of home equity loans is we wouldn't be able to take it on ourselves until we have 20% equity in the house. We could likely afford the as-is price but not with a 20% down payment, in addition to a home equity loan on top of the mortgage...at least not fast enough for the exterior repairs.

Most of it is student loans which scare me and I am in grad school. I am so scared as to what to do. I\u2019m fairly new to Reddit and hope I\u2019m posting I\u2019m the correct place. An additional stressor I have is my house I bought 4 years ago. It was a mistake as it\u2019s an old house and has caused me so many problems to a point I have had to take out loans to fix them. Those loans approx equal 15k.\n\nNow it turns out I have more expenses coming up. Something is wrong with the plumbing so have to fix that and I am not sure of the expense on that yet and I have to replace the furnace because it is causing a lot of troubles. It even turned off once and wouldn\u2019t turn back on. The technician managed to turn it back on but told me there\u2019s also cracks in the furnace itself and it may become a bad situation soon so replace it asap. He gave me a quote for 7k. I can shop around and get more quotes but that\u2019s another expense. I have been trying to save lately but haven\u2019t gotten to that much yet. It feels like expenses keep coming. The only thing I bought for fun for myself was a perfume, other than that I\u2019m always focused on surviving and I make wayyyyy tooo much to be surviving. My questions are, with the expenses coming ahead, should I focus on paying off the credit card first or build my emergency fund? And should I take out another loan for either of the expenses coming up?\n\nI make 100k. Credit card is currently sitting at 6.1k 24.99% APR. my monthly expenses I have per month equate to 3.8k and can fish out about $1k a month towards Saving or paying off debt. I am maxing out my 401k match at 4% and don\u2019t want to take that away. My emergency fund only has 2.5k so not even covered for a month. I am not sure what to do at this point.\n\nEdit: thank you all for so many responses. I definitely needed to hear some of the things y\u2019all have mentioned, mainly taking a break from school until I get my debts paid off and then cash flow it. I definitely have so many options and my plan is to get out of debt now because I make too much to be drowning like this.

I'm really happy with this and pay a little extra and could realistically pay this off in about 10 years if nothing changes.  I married into a lot of credit card debt, something I was aware of beforehand and would do again.  \n\nWhat I am considering is refinancing my house to help pay off our debts.  We can manage fine, but I'd love to have the peace of mind of not having this debt.  We haven't added to our debt, other than a vehicle, so I don't foresee there being an issue with the debt coming back.  \n\nI would take out a 30 year mortgage at 5.99% (this is a tough to think about based on my current mortgage).  This will pay off about $55K in debt which includes all credit card and a vehicle.  In total this will save us about $1500 a month in payments.  About 20K for a vehicle and the rest in credit card debt.  Vehicle is about 7% interest.\n\n\nAdditional info, we are not struggling to pay bills at this time.  I do max out my 401K and both of us max out our IRAs.  My wife is paying a little bit into her 401K, maybe $5K per year but she just started doing that as her new job offers it.   I would use the extra savings to save for college for our 2 kids and start to build up a safety net of savings.  Once we have 6 months saved, I'd then like to increase my wife's 401K contribution.\n\nDoes refinancing even make sense?  Or am I falling for the mortgage guys sales pitch?  I tend to get these types of ideas and run with them.  I don't know if I need a reality check.\n\nEdit:  Got the dose of reality that I needed.  Looking into only contributing to retirement to get full company match and put difference to pay debts.  Then go back to making out retirement for both of us if possible.

I would like some more insight on how I may be able to improve. I lived (still living) with my parents while going to college, and worked the entire time; Which was what made me able to graduate debt-free and pay off my car, thankfully. My parents are more than happy to help me achieve my goals so I am trying to take advantage to not only improve my future but to also be in a better position to help them down the road even more.\n\nI'm 27 years old and was making $88,000\/year, and have just received a raise to $91,500. I currently have a total portfolio worth roughly $85k. Of that total, $20,000 is currently sitting in an HYSA, and just about $63,000 is spread across two 401(k)s, a roth (already maxed out for this year), and a few other investment accounts. Remainder is pretty much in my checking account. \n\nI currently contribute 10% of my salary to my 401(k) with no employer match, not sure if I should change that. Before the raise I was making around $4,800 a month, and saving anywhere from $3,000-$3,500; my employer fully pays for my insurance as well. I am not planning to increase the percentage I've budgeted for myself, and am aiming to save the new amount. Around 65% of that money earned each month is going into the HYSA, and I'll throw anywhere from $250-$500 of that in my investment account on top of the 401(k) contributions each month ($366 per check). I usually invest towards VTI, SCHD, or VOO. My average spending is no more than $1,500\/month. We live in a HCOL area and I do not drive the most gas efficient car. \n\nMy own bills are around $400, car insurance takes most of that at around $150 a month. I contribute around another $500 towards rent, food, and other home related expenses, and the rest is my spending money and pays for gas. Am I losing money having it sit in an HYSA? Should I just invest a portion of that amount? What happens if I'd like to buy a home, can I just pull that money from my investments without taking a huge hit? Is there a better way to allocate my funds?\n\nAs for my goals, I'd like to buy a home in the next 5 years and turn it into a rental property, but am not too aware of how that process works, I wouldn't mind buying out of state-- My understanding is that I'd need to live there if I only put 3.5% down, would probably aim for a 20% down payment-- but that may be a post for another subreddit? I am aiming towards generating some form of passive income, and am open to seeing how my current situation can help lead me towards obtaining that goal with more clarity.

I got married last year. My wife is full-time housewife and we are having our first child this year or next. I am working on financial planning for us and our child.\n\nMy total comp is 286k (185k base + 18k bonus + 83k RSU). I try my best to accurately project and make use of my discretionary cash. By that I mean the money after tax-withholding, retirement account, health insurance. My effective tax rate (married filing jointly) is 24% based on year 2022 tax return. My AGI last year was 270k with 23.4% effective tax rate. Here's breakdown of my non-discretionary items:\n\n||Annual|Monthly|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tax|68.5k|5.7k|\n|401k|22.5k|1.8k|\n|HSA|7.3k|0.6k|\n|IRA (mine and wife's)|13k|1.1k|\n|insurance|1.7k|$140|\n|additional insurance|1.3k|$109|\n|**Total**|114k|9.5k|\n\nAfter the 114k non discretionary stuff, I'm left with 172k cash, or 14.3k per month. My projected spending are as follows. The numbers are based on previous year's bookkeeping.\n\n* We are renting in HCOL area, 2.4k is very cheap in the area (1B1B)\n* I'm in my master program and have to pay some tuition.\n* Traveling 10k is for traveling back to our home country where we will host out wedding this year.\n* Grocery cost us 6k last year. This year we up the budget because a baby is on the way and we want to eat very well.\n* Wife hobby is for her to do whatever she wants.\n* We dine out every week, often with friends, approx once a week. Each outing costs \\~$100.\n* Baby supply is to prepare our first child.\n* We have a retriever who eats $80 of food a month, and $30 insurance a month. That's how it costs 1.5k a year (some toys and treats were also purchased).\n* Legal $900 is for tax filing and visa related fees.\n* Subscription is cut down to minimum, with only YouTube Red and LeetCode. We even got rid of Amazon prime & Netflix.\n* Server, web domain etc is for side hustles which I'm trying to develop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Annual|Monthly|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rent|28.8k|2.4k|\n|Tuition|12k|1k|\n|Traveling|10k|$830|\n|Grocery|9k|$750|\n|Wife Hobby|7.2k|$600|\n|Dining out, social|6k|$500|\n|Medical|5k|$417|\n|Baby supply|5k|$417|\n|My Hobby|3.6k|$300|\n|Utility|3k|$250|\n|Gas, Parking, Transit|2.4k|$200|\n|Car Insurance|2k|$167|\n|Pet|1.5k|$125|\n|Book|1k|$83|\n|Legal|$900|$75|\n|Hygiene|$900|$75|\n|Entertainment|$500|$42|\n|Fitness|$500|$42|\n|Phone Plan (for 2 persons)|$360|$30|\n|Subscription|$240|$20|\n|Server, domain registration|$240|$20|\n|Total|102k|8.5k|\n\nWith the 102k projected expenses, I'm left with 172k-102k=70k leftover (5.7k per month), which is our discretionary savings in additional to the 51k non-discretionary (22.5k 401k + 8k match + 13k IRA + 7.3k HSA). Our tax-advantaged accounts are pretty much maxed out. Here is my current finance:\n\n* 401k: current balance 85k, expect 22.5k contribution and 8k employer match this year\n* IRA: current balance 34k in Roth, expect 6.5k contribution this year in my traditional and spouse's IRA, both of which will be converted into Roth\n* HSA: current balance 10.5k, 8.5k of which is invested in SP500 index (2k is sitting in bank as required minimum)\n* Still have 85k uninvested cash, and 14k tax refund receivable (thanks to marriage).\n* I am on automatic DCA schedule of buying $200 VOO every day (for over 120 days now) which will consume 53k of cash each year. I still have 46k uninvested cash this year.\n* Car is paid off. Credit card is paid off monthly. No loan. No mortgage. Basically no debt.\n\nMy main concerns are:\n\n* Is my monthly cash flow and expense expectation reasonable to accommodate family of 3 in HCOL?\n* How to deal with the uninvested cash and 14k tax refund.

I\u2019ve been with this company for about 2 years come June. My gross take home for 2022 was $72915.53 which netted to be about $65,611.08. Base salary is 60k with a guaranteed bonus of 12k. I opted into the 401k last February and just hit one year with that a few weeks ago. My company matches 4% and I put in 5%. So far my ROI since inception as of this week was 7.78%. Most of it is in Mid Cap index funds and a few Vanguard Funds. $2400 went towards my IRA contribution. I\u2019m already set up to put the full 6K away this year. As for my IRA it consists of a few blue chips, some Vanguard ETFs, and some Dividend stocks.

My understanding is that I'm stuck with that amount there until I retire, since I can't convert it back to Roth. I'm seeing things about a so-called \"cream in coffee\" rule making it so that any after-tax contributions I make to the Traditional IRA and then convert to Roth will now get taxed twice.

At $50K, the rate increases to Prime minus 0.26%. About 2 years old.\n\nWe are fortunate enough to be able to allocate an extra $1K\/month. We'd been applying that to the mortgage, but the recent Prime rate increases are making our HELOC payment go up and we want to review our plan.  Internet research indicates paying off the higher interest loan will likely save money, and making the lower-amount loan will be more emotionally rewarding. So we'd want to apply the extra to the HELOC. So far so good.\n\nI'm using LibreOffice Calc to determine how much various scenarios would cost but something is wrong with my calculations.  I'm hoping someone can review and help me find my error(s).\n\nI'm using the following formula to calculate the balance after each payment:\n\n(balance)+((balance\\*(APR\/365)\\*(DaysSinceLastPmt)) - (MinPmt) - (ExtraPmt))\n\nE.g. For the HELOC which is paid biweekly, (62793.18)+((62793.18\\*(6.74\/365)\\*(14)) - 203.43 - 500\n\nThis gives me numbers and payoff dates that seem pretty reasonable, and are close to online calculators.\n\nNext I want to work out how much interest we'd be paying in each scenario. For that, I'm using the following formula:\n\n((Count-MinPmt\\*MinPmt)+(Count-Min&ExtraPmt\\*(MinPmt+ExtraPmt))) - Starting Balance = Interest Paid from now until Payoff\n\n\\[edit: corrected the above\\]\n\nE.g. For the HELOC (318\\*203.43) + (66\\*(203.43+500)) - 62793.18 = $48,323.94, payoff in Nov 2037.\n\nFor this particular scenario, I'm applying the extra to the mortgage until it's paid off in May 2035 and then I apply the extra to the HELOC. (Although I just realized once the mortgage is paid off, we can apply that entire amount to the HELOC, not just the extra.  But that's moot for my purposes until my math is correct.)\n\nI'm getting inconsistent results when I apply and adjust these formulas to different scenarios. For example, in the scenario where we apply the extra to the HELOC only, it shows we'll spend $8956 in interest and have it paid off by July 2031. That seems quite low given that we've been charged about $700 in interest in the first two months of 2023. And when I do a scenario where we split the extra between the two loans, it shows that it's paid off in September 2029 with a total of $58,196 in interest, so almost two years sooner but $50K *more* in interest.\n\nThat's before I even get into the main mortgage. Clearly, I've made an error somewhere, but not sure where.\n\nHoping someone can either find my error, or post another way to easily compare various payment plans.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678658423.0},{"title":"Selling home in HCL area and making a profit, moved to a lower cost area, what\u2019s the smart thing to do with the money?","author":"mockingbird2602","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11pr7dc\/selling_home_in_hcl_area_and_making_a_profit\/","text":"We\u2019ve recently moved from WA state and sold our home.

They have possession of the vehicle, and now live states away. I've never made payments on it, just put a couple hundred towards the down payment. I don't speak to this ex anymore. Even if I did, nothing fruitful would come of it based on the kind of person they are.

Then I got a notice they made a (small) payment on the vehicle. Now, a couple of weeks later, I've received a notice that it's gone to collections.

I currently own a home in a very nice subdivision that is estimated to be worth somewhere between $500k and $525k. The property is 2700 square feet and on half an acre with a large yard. I have about $350k left on the mortgage right now. I recently found a property that is listed for $449k that is 1400 square feet and is on 5 acres of land.  The property has increased in value by $200k since 2018. Additionally, there is a well constructed detached garage and a brand new full sized barn on the property (obviously not included in the square footage). It's just my wife and I with our pups, so losing a bunch of square footage that we don't use much in our current home is an easy sacrifice that we are willing to make in order to move out of a subdivision and into the country a bit more.  The plan if we move forward would be to sell the house we live in now, and take the extra money we receive from the sale and use it as a roughly 33% down payment on the new place, leaving us with a $300k mortgage left to pay off. For our current home we have a 2.75% interest rate on a 30 year fixed that we have been making about two additional payments on every year.  My credit has remained steady at around 750, but I purchased our current home before we got married, and her credit is only around 600 so I figure that, in addition to the fact that interest rates aren't as good now as they were when I bought our current home may significantly affect the interest rate that we get for the potential new home.

I currently have a total $33k in student loans (not private) from my BS and MS (which I finished last June) that have not started accruing interest yet due to the government's pause. Most of my financial literacy has been achieved in the last year, and I have been following the guiding principles of this subreddit in order to configure my financial life now that I actually make a salary.\n\nI currently have accrued and set aside \\~$25k so far from my salary to ensure I won't have to pay any interest on my loans when the time comes to begin repayment (since this won't be for a few months still, I will have saved the remaining $8k by then). This does not include my emergency fund and more than 15% of my income has gone to retirement as well. With an 82k salary in HCOL CA, these savings are only made possible by the decision to live at home until my loans are repaid and the fact that I chose to loan more than I needed to for my MS last year (I graduated with some already put aside for loan repayment). I apologize if this is too much information; I often see requests for more details on this sub and I didn't want to be that person who gives no context for real advice. I also hope that this eases any concern that my funds for student loans are not jeopardizing my financials in other departments.\n\nThe question: what should I be doing with this money until then? As I see it, the easiest answer is keeping it in the HYSA (Marcus) I already have, which also prevents me from worrying exactly what date I will need the money. My understanding is that while T-Bills aren't state taxed like HYSA interest is, it'd be negligible over such a short term even in CA, but is that actually true\/right?\n\nFinally, since my loans have interest rates of 4.45, 5.05, 4.53, 2.75, and 5.28 percent should I even be seeking to pay my entire balance before accruing interest? I always planned to save enough to do so because to my novice mind it was \"paying loan servicer lowest amount of money = best strategy\" but I recognize that circumstances may exist where a payment plan could open up the possibility of other strategies for the funds I currently have to come out ahead overall with regards to interest, inflation, etc.\n\nThank you so much to anyone still reading, and please don't hesitate to ask for any other information necessary for guiding me through this process.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678651248.0},{"title":"Where to park my money?","author":"Zhetzu","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11po5ct\/where_to_park_my_money\/","text":"I have no debt and have an emergency fund in i bonds.

I could probably max this account if I wanted to, but I'm worried that I may be getting heavily penalized without being able to see it.\n\nThanks very much!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648986.0},{"title":"How should we file our taxes if got married middle of July and I moved from NJ to NY while my husband was always in NY.

What I'm hoping to figure out is 1) What would such a plan look like? and 2) Would this be a good idea, assuming I was ok with the risk?\n\nBasically, I'm currently 21 years old and going to school for computer science, and as such, I have a long time until retirement and I expect to generate decent earnings in my life. I'm already planning on following all of the standard advice on saving for retirement (employer fund match, contributing to an IRA, etc.). In addition to all of the standard retirement savings, I was hoping to use a brokerage account in order to invest so that in approximately 15 years or so, I'll have a decent lump sum of money to put towards a down payment on a home, family vehicle, etc. I'm not quite sure what my life will look like at around age 35, but I expect by then I will be ready to settle down into my \"forever\" home with a lot of land, with my (hopefully) young children. As such, I'd like to have this fund to use to jump start this that's separate from my retirement. \n\nSo, with all that said, how would you go about doing that? Is this even a good idea or would a different approach to accomplishing this goal be better? \n\nWhat I'm currently thinking is to use my brokerage account to invest almost if not completely in stocks, most likely just in index funds with the occasional individual stock pick if I feel like it. The main question then is how should I allocate the ratio of different index funds. Since I'm going for a high growth strategy here, I'd imagine some percentage of small-cap stock fund would be appropriate. Should I mainly focus on dividing up my investments by small, mid, and large cap index funds? Should I get any international stocks? Should I incorporate any bonds at all? Is 15 years long enough to recover from the volatility of these investments? I'm ok dealing with a good amount of risk here, but I want to be smart about it. \n\nThanks for the help all!","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678634479.0},{"title":"Consolidating credit card debt","author":"ZealousKnight1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11pms9j\/consolidating_credit_card_debt\/","text":"Hello!

Currently, I'm only beginning to build up my financial literacy and at 22, I had my head so far in the clouds and just completely rejected the modern financial system. Ten years later, here we are with two feet, trying to walk on the ground.\n\nI inherited a taxable brokerage account with about $72,000 of assets, all individual stocks. This money was coming from my deceased grandfather who I never met and was managed by my estranged uncle. My uncle made quite the fortune as a day trader, but I'm under the impression that this account was more a \"buy and hold\" type strategy. I remember at the time, some of my family members explained to me that the stocks were all dividend paying stocks that were being reinvested and that compounding the interest on the dividends was desirable.\n\nThere were no mutual fund holdings, just five individual stocks. It was all biotechnology, pharma, tobacco and AT&T was the only company I recall. It seems like this is decently diversified for individual stocks. But after reading about index fund investing, this approach seems highly aggressive and overly risky. I gather that some people focus on growth stocks versus dividend stocks, but for most people, mutual funds and target date funds seem to be the best investment strategy. \n\nI guess I'm curious about how much growth even matters with dividend stocks. In a portfolio like I one I inherited, even if the market was down for a few years, I understand that my holdings would lose value, but some of that would be made up for in dividends, correct?\n\nAlso, why was this a taxable brokerage and not a 529?\n\nI'm not a high income earner by any means, but am wanting to learn more about different investment strategies and perhaps even learn about day trading. Mainly, I just want to see different opinions on the usage of a taxable brokerage account for building wealth before retirement. I opened up a Roth IRA last year and maxed the contributions. Current holdings are 85% VTSAX and 15% VXUS.\n\nI've only skimmed through \"The Little Book of Common Sense Investing\", but am wondering about using individual stocks (likely dividend stocks) buffered with maybe VOO in a taxable account that I sort of gamble with. Can day trading be done on the side or is it really more of a full-time thing?

I would like to remain as anonymous as possible, but I realise in divulging in information needed to ascertain the clearest picture, that may be tricky.\n\nWe work in the trade and construction sector In NZ. Following the lead up to and passing of my last of two parents, in a particularly distressing manner, I\u2019ve significantly fallen behind. Between mental, drug and gambling disorders I\u2019ve allowed a hole to be dug that\u2019s led a significant, albeit manageable debt to surround what I\u2019ve managed to put together. Essentially in coming up to end of year taxes, and recovering from what was a tumultuous several months or longer from the passing of said parental figure - I\u2019ve now left myself with no wiggle room while my parents estate is due to clear up reasonably soon. I have been juggling as best I can and with help from our main supplier of work I\u2019ve kept things flowing. In terms of, keeping up with debts, chipping back toward the green and staying afloat. Personal finances too, of which there are several but not at a significant amount.\n\nI am now in the predicament I have a considerable amount due over the coming weeks - and as it stands it could be a week or 6 before the estate is cleared and inheritance paid. Most institutions have looked at both my personal, and business accounts and have passed on any form of financial offering. I cannot find one that would consider the inheritance- as figures I\u2019ve been confirmed, and supplied by a barrister, for confirmation. Even though a preferential creditor can take priority over myself in the event of falling through. \n\nMy largest assets, within the business are still tied to debt themselves if albeit, not that much. And an overdue, but currently being paid at an agreed amount tax debt is also a red flag for lenders.\n\nIn short I\u2019ve been keeping going with the knowledge of the inheritance and the planning that if properly utilised I\u2019ll be able to get into and back out of debt reasonably quickly given the business short expenditures and reasonable income to make up for the again, mare that was the second half of 2022. But it may be looking perhaps that the plug should be pulled, even if within a-few weeks of a stuff up saving amount of money. Unfortunately it seems I may have left it perhaps too long before attempting to fix myself and my situation, but I\u2019m coming out of the worst period of my life so far, I am doing it many steps behind to my own fault. \n\nLending cannot be given on good intentions, but the money to come in far outweighs any amount I am asking for. I\u2019ve exhausted attempts with financial institutions, family, the executors and trustees etc and will not have long before the bills are again in the red. \n\nWith the vague information given, are there any snippets someone could offer within the NZ financial sector. In making up for myself, and my parents I would really endeavour to see this through, and not give up what is a good stream of income for myself and my employees, that also being said, I\u2019m willing to own up for my mistakes over that period too, and would sooner pride myself on seeing this all earn and fought back, as opposed to bailing and starting at zero to the expense of others.\n\nThank you sincerely for any and all suggestions","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678605069.0},{"title":"I am a bit confused by how credit card spending effects my credit score?","author":"MammothNo8777","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11pfynx\/i_am_a_bit_confused_by_how_credit_card_spending\/","text":"Hi everyone,\n\nA suggestion was made to me by a friend to put all my expenses on my credit cards so I can get as much miles\/cashback as possible.\n\nI was told to make a payment as soon as the transaction posts instead of waiting until the statement balance comes out.\n\nWouldn't this still run up my utilization and hurt my credit score?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678631716.0},{"title":"Balance Transfer Denied","author":"throwawaytnght","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11porf4\/balance_transfer_denied\/","text":"I recently tried to transfer a balance from one credit card to another (different banks).

I'm currently around $40k in debt from federal student loans, mostly subsidized. In the next year I will pay another $30k in tuition, $14k of which will be covered by scholarships. I have about $5k invested in index funds through a Roth IRA, it has been falling for awhile, we all know how the stock market has been. I have another $18k in a mix of high interest and regular savings. I make $2400 a month before taxes, 15% of which I put into a 401k with my company. I have a few expenses coming up that will total to $6k. My living expenses are around $1500 a month depending on the month. I own two cars with no loans on them, I will be selling one later this year, I can probably get $3-4k for it. I am working towards my undergraduate degree and an MBA, which my company won't cover but I will get a 5-10% pay bump for having it after I graduate. I would like to purchase a rental property as soon as I can after I graduate. I also want to really focus on building up my retirement, and I don't plan on raising my cost of living anymore than absolutely necessary. I am planning on getting married in 2 years, and I will have to support my spouse for 2 more years while they wrap up their masters degee. I currently plan to save up about $10k after I graduate and agressively pay loans off then split between savings and reitirement, but I dont know what to do right now, and I know in some cases it is better to invest than pay loans but the market had been bad, so I want to make sure I am on track, or if there is a better way to approach it. I know coworkers that completed the same program I have and I have a ball park of what I will make, but it has been all over the place based on experience and before or after everyone's pay got adjusted for inflation. None of them have a masters degree. I have heard basically $70k-$90k, plus bonuses, which have been between $2-12k. So I pretty much plan to make $70k out of college being conservative. So here's my questions.\n\n1.) If I decide not to finish with an MBA I will miss out on the pay bump, but I will have a tuition bill of $18k less in the coming year and I will be able to work enough extra hours to make another $1200-1500 a month. Most of which I would use to pay down loans. I did not decide to do an MBA for pay, it was more due to interest in business management and engineering, but it is more expensive this way. Is it financially worth it in the long run to continue with an MBA while in undergrad knowing I would keep the pay bump?\n\n2.) Should I be paying loans off before I'm investing? In other words would I be better off to stop investing the 15% from my checks and start paying loans, or even withdraw the money that's losing money in my Roth IRA to pay on the loans (it's less than what I've contributed so I shouldn't take any penalties from what I have read on the terms of the account or anything) considering federal loans are still at 0%?\n\n3.) Once I graduate, should I focus more on saving, investing or repaying what's left of my loans and in what order if I plan to be out of student debt and have a rental property as soon as possible?\n\nI think that sums up my current situation, I didn't factor the cost of a wedding in, but it seems like it will be kept pretty cheap and will be 90% covered by her parents.

The charge said it was a payment to a credit card, but I did not owe anywhere near that amount on my company card associated to that account. I also didn\u2019t owe that much on any personal cards, but those would not have been associated with the business account anyways. \nI immediately contacted the bank who confirmed it was a credit card payment. They were able to find the number of the card that the charge went toward. I do not own, nor have I ever owned a card with the number they gave me. Needless to say, this is fraud.

We're due to close 6 days from today.  We had thought everything was well on track and our loan officer had actually told us several weeks ago we could close sooner if we wanted.  The sellers were really set on the closing date, so we didn't change anything.\n\nYesterday our loan officer reached out to my husband to let him know that apparently his 2020 taxes were not filed.  They need the 2021 and 2020 taxes for closing.  We married in 2022, so I had no information on his taxes from that time.  My husband had no idea his 2020 taxes had not been submitted.  He had everything filled out, so he isn't sure what happened.  All years before and after are all set.  Apparently the online service he used cannot e-file old tax years, and it has to be done by a CPA.  After a lot of attempts we found someone that can do this for us, but they cannot fit us in until Monday due to the weekend (it's Saturday today).\n\nSo how screwed are we right now?  We're not so worried about the taxes, as he was actually owed money and we're working on getting this submitted.  We really don't know how this impacts closing at this point.  The sellers were really set on the date, and I understand they could potentially walk away from the deal if we don't close then.  Hopefully they wouldn't do this since they then have to start the process all over again if so.  The loan officer is pointing all the blame on us for this, and called us criminals for not filing our taxes.  I understand that the taxes should have been filed already, but we thought they had been.\n\nWe're baffled how this wasn't discovered sooner.  Our offer was accepted just over 6 weeks ago, and our loan was approved and locked in about a month ago.  He previously told us and our realtor that everything was all ready to go.  As to why he only found out now, our loan officer submitted an outdated form to the IRS requesting this information.  The IRS ignored the form because it wasn't the correct version.  Our loan officer submitted the correct version this past week after not hearing a response from the IRS and calling to find out why.  So our loan officer just found out yesterday.

Please help!","author":"kittymcmeowster","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11oyg30\/beginning_to_adult_at_almost_30_and_want_to_get\/","text":"Hi there friends, I have read the flowchart (bless it), I have been reading through posts and the PF wiki, and found it all very helpful. Still, as I prepare to \"adult\" for the first time (hate that phrase), I would like some of you seasoned veterans to look over my finances, as I'm quite nervous.\n\nI just got a job at a startup in a city after finishing my PhD, which means I now have 5x the income to figure out how to spend wisely, and I am 29. I have struggled financially my whole life due to being a student for all of it, and I want to continue to live like a grad student to save. Posting my budget with some questions at the end. Here is my budget:\n\nGross income: 130k. Not including bonus since it varies.\n\nMonthly net pay: $7400 (from [smartasset.com](https:\/\/smartasset.com). I haven't gotten my first paycheck yet)\n\nRent: $2850 (1 bedroom apartment, it does not get cheaper here sadly unless I want roommates, and I definitely do not).\n\nTransit: $400 (this is parking, car insurance, gas, and subway\/bus pass. Unfortunately I do use my car daily but take the subway\/bus to work)\n\nGroceries and restaurants: $500\n\nMonthly bills: $300 (utilities, phone, and gym membership)\n\nMisc. expenses: $400 (Pet care, clothing, random expenses)\n\nThose are my monthly expenses, but I made a significant financial mistake last year and am now in debt. In May 2022, my landlord increased my rent 40%, making my rent 85% of my (very low) grad student income. I was due to graduate in June 2022, so I re-signed the lease, thinking I would just live off my savings for the one month, and eat the \"lease cutting\" fee. We all know where this is going.... my PhD advisor changed his mind, and I finally graduated in January 2023. I was not able to find someone to take over my lease, so am still paying it, to the tune of $2300\/mo until May 2023. To un-fuck myself, I took out a personal loan at 8% in December, when I got this job offer. The balance now of the personal loan is $17k. The monthly payments are $560. \n\nI also have $30k in student loan debt (from undergrad - $21k federal, $9k private). I maintain student status until May 2023, and then have a six-month grace period as I understand it, meaning I will begin paying in November to the tune of $500\/mo.\n\nI also work for a start-up, so need a sizable emergency fund in case it goes belly-up. I am confident I could get another job without having to move if that were to happen. \n\nRight now, I have $7k in my bank account. After these monthly expenses, I have $3k left over monthly. I would really, really like to pay off the debt at 8% before I have to begin paying on my student loans. I also have very little retirement savings. My health insurance premiums are covered by my job, but it is an HDHP so I have an HSA. Right now, I contribute:\n\n$300 monthly to the HSA\n\n$500 monthly to my roth IRA (Schwab TDF)\n\n$400 into an HYSA (Ally, 3.6%)\n\n$600 into a non-tax-advantaged investment account.\n\n$560 for the stupid loan... \n\nThis leaves me with an extra $500\/mo to put towards the loan as well. Until May though, I need to use it along with my current cash to pay off the rent in the place I'm not living in anymore, but will begin putting it toward the loan in June. \n\nAs dictated by the almighty flow chart, I also plan to stop contributing to my IRA and HSA in order to pay off the loan more quickly. Starting in June, that gives me around $1800\/mo toward the loan, which I think will allow me to pay it off by November. Then in November I will just be making student loan payments, and will then continue to contribute to my HSA and IRA.\n\nAgain... I made such a stupid mistake with that loan, on multiple levels.

However, after completing my filing through FreeTaxUSA (haven't submitted yet), it looks like we're not being taxed at all on the conversion, which is where I feel like we did something wrong.

These were the only funds in the Trad IRA\n* Dec 2022: Wife opened a Roth IRA and converted the Traditional IRA (\\~$2k) to the Roth IRA\n* Jan 2023: Wife contributed $6k to the Roth IRA as a 2022 contribution\n* Feb 2023: We realized our 2022 MAGI was over the Roth IRA limit, so she recharacterized her $6k Roth IRA contribution to a Traditional IRA\n\nThat brings us today, with my wife's current situation:\n\n* Traditional IRA: \\~$6k of post-tax dollars that were recharacterized from Roth IRA.

Will I get fined\/penalized? My second question is does he get fined\/penalized for not giving them out by the deadline? Lastly, how long does he get with the extension?","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678538426.0},{"title":"At 21 I just established 6 months of credit and got my Credit Score today- is there anything else to do?","author":"smashingpumpass","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/11oto55\/at_21_i_just_established_6_months_of_credit_and\/","text":"After 6 months paying 40% utilization rate on my Capital One card I got my score from Experian today and my score was 707. When I started I was wanting to buy a car because I walk to work but I still dont have enough for a down payment, I break even pretty much after bills and food so I'm still working on getting any form of savings. \n\nSo pretty much, right now I don't think I have a use for it. Should I be working on getting new lines of credit? I forgot to mention I do have a line open for Care Credit which is like a credit card for doctors and medical stuff but besides that and Capital One (plus maybe some old hard inquiries I did) there should be nothing on my report.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678565217.0}]
