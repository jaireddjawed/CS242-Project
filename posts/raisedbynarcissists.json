[{"title":"Mods needed! Do you care about this community? Would you like to help us keep it going? Apply to be a mod!","author":"RBNmod","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/w855ed\/mods_needed_do_you_care_about_this_community\/","text":"[Heyo RBN!](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/dzaUX7CAG0Ihi\/giphy.gif)\n\nThis is an invitation for those of you who have been active for a minimum of 6 months in this group or other groups in a supportive capacity - i.e. those of you who have come along far enough in your recovery to give support and advice:\n\nDo you have 6 months of supportive activity in a Reddit support group that will be visible through your account history?\n\nWe have an opportunity for you! We are looking for some people who would like to be trained to be an RBN mod. Specifically, we are looking for people who care deeply about this community and the support that it offers and would like to help the team develop it and keep it safe. We are not looking for folks who just want another badge.\n\nYou can spend as much time as you like helping keep this community safe for abuse survivors. If you have 20 minutes a day, that's a huge help! If you have 2 hours a day, that's great too! It's all up to you!\n\nAs this is a huge subreddit, we understand that jumping right in can be stressful. That is why we are looking for people who would like to (start out or) be mini-mods. What\u2019s a mini-mod, you may ask? Well, we are looking for mini-mods to do one or both of the following:\n\n* Flair Control - As a flair mod, your sole responsibility would be to go through our unmodded links, and confirm or apply the proper flairs according to guidelines. We have automoderator tag according to key words, but as it\u2019s a robot that can\u2019t understand context, it\u2019s not always right. Many people do not apply flairs or do not know how to apply flairs as well (which is absolutely fine!) as this mod would help with that.\n* Auto-Mod Queue - as a queue mod, you would go through our queue and deal with only the items reported by our automoderator. The automoderator will report items based on key words, to confirm context or to alert us to possible drama or someone who needs extra support. As far as user reports go, you will not be responsible for this, as we will handle this.\n\nMini-mods are not given full mod permissions immediately. Like most jobs there is a probationary period to ensure that the new team member is an appropriate fit for the sub (acts appropriately, follows the mod rules\/guidelines, etc.). Generally, training takes one to two months for mini-mods but that depends on the individual, the time they can commit to the volunteer position, how much material is covered, and how the senior mods feel about the trainee's progress.\n\nIf you'd like to be promoted to a full-mod eventually, that is something you can work towards. If you would like to stay a mini-mod, that is just fine too! It's up to you.\n\nHowever, there is one bit that is no longer optional. Availability on Discord *for text chat only* (never video) is required. It doesn't mean that you must be on Discord all day or that you must answer any message to you on Discord instantly. It just means that you should be able to check-in with Discord periodically (at least a few times a week) to get updates from the other mods about what is going on and for training assignments, etc.\n\nWe also want to be honest about what this job entails. It is reading a lot of triggering content. It is seeing the truly dark side of RBN that our general members never get to see, because we try to remove all that B.S. before our members have to read that nonsense. It can take an emotional toll, but it is also rewarding. The thank you notes that we occasionally get from members are nice. The posts that thank the mods because the group saved their life... those are nice, too.\n\nAnother amazing optional perk that most of our mods seem to really enjoy is the friendship and mini-support group nature of the mod team itself behind the scenes.  We share pictures of our pets, kids, gripes about our jobs, memes, and we help each other navigate the feeling stirred up just being an ACoN, but also that naturally come up as a moderator.  Moderators are not required to become friends or close friends with the team AT ALL.  This is never a requirement ever and we have had mods who were very well regarded on the team and really just kinda did their jobs and then did their own things offline after that, which is 100% welcome and fine!  For the most part, modding is what you make it and that's the beauty of it.  <3\n\nIf modding sounds like a good job for you, fill out the form linked below and it will be reviewed ASAP! Successful applicants will be contacted by a mod of \/r\/raisedbynarcissists sometime in the future (sorry, no time line available at this point).\n\nNote: If you have alts, please include your other account names in the application. It will help the evaluation process go more smoothly.

You can never ask straight forward questions. You can never have straightforward conversations. Nothing is simple and direct. Everything has to be a long Lord of the Rings story across the galaxy about something completely unrelated that the original question was long gone. You can never hold them accountable because they have excuses upon excuses. You can never ask them a simple question because they deflect and ask you another question. You can never have an honest conversation because it will be sidetracked to something other than what you were trying to discuss.\n\nIt is the most mentally exhausting mental gymnastics you have to do.

I am now doing that work as an adult.\n\nNow, with a kid, I get waves of sadness. I don't rely on my parents for support. I never really have\/knew I couldn't. But I am slowly letting go of that hope.\n\nGoing NC with my parents has been such a burden-lifting feeling. Not only was I *not* receiving the support I needed before, I was also being burdened by their instability.\n\nNow, I am on a journey to build up my community, my family, my life. I am building up my confidence. Even if I don't have a blood-family for support, I will always have myself. The rest of the world can be chaotic, imperfect, unpredictable, needy. I will always have me.\n\n**Edit**: To the people asking for tips. Get as much support in other ways as you can. Ways I did this:\n\n* **Focus on my values:** My values include surrounding myself with people who respect me and lift me up. I value optimism, my family, my friends, and fun.\n* **Therapy:** I go weekly right now. It has helped so much. Progress takes months to see. They have given me the tools to deal and work through with my issues in a healthier way.\n* **Rekindle Old Friendships:** Since I got therapy, I have been a much kinder, more generous friend. My old friendships have blossomed.\n* **Find People Who are In the Same Boat:** I have found other mom's to reach out to and are starting to befriend couples with kids. We can then face similar challenges together!\n* **Focusing on my Health:** I am not militant about this. I try to move my body everyday, eat healthier sometimes, indulge sometimes, get enough sleep, avoid screentime, avoid alcohol (it's a depressant), journaling, keeping a gratitude journal, reading.\n* **Redefining Happiness:** Happiness does not being 10\/10 everyday. It means having gratitude for those moments of joy, enjoying the upswings, and riding out the low ones. When I am feeling low, I go back to my values and lean on my supports to bring myself back up. I recommend **The Happiness Lab by Laurie Santos**. She is Yale professor who has changed people's lives with her happiness course. Happiness is state of being that you can work towards.\n\n**Edit #2:**\n\nAlso, the biggest tip I have is to remember, it is difficult! I am struggling and have down moments. The stuff above helps. I remember that this will take time. Time, patience, love for myself, and gratitude for the things I do have.

I feel like this has been eating me from the inside for years now. I feel like I have no family. Me and my younger sister used to be very close but our relationship got gradually strained to the point it\u2019s terrible now. I recently offered going to therapy together which we now do. I pay for it because I\u2019m older, earn more\u2026 and frankly I care more. That\u2019s not the issue though, I\u2019m happy to pay for it and that\u2019s fine. Even though we go to the therapy, nothing is improving. My sister and brother hate each other but I keep in touch with both of them. Every time we discuss holidays, problems arise because my sister doesn\u2019t want to see my brother but me and my grandma do. I offered spending one day with my sister and one day with my brother but my sister isn\u2019t happy with that because she lives in the house he would be visiting for holidays and she doesn\u2019t want him there. Today my sister yet again said she wishes she cut me off. This is because I refused to uninvite our brother to mutual Easter celebration at our grandma\u2019s house where my sister and grandma both live. My brother and sister absolutely hate each other and every time they argue my sister says she wishes she cut off the entire family because the stress is not worth it. We barely have any family left, our parents passed when we were young and we only have each other and our grandma. I never take my brothers side (I remain neutral) but she still says such hurtful things. \nEven though I\u2019ve said in therapy I don\u2019t want my sister to keep saying she would cut me off, she did it yet again. Therapist advised separating my sisters and mine relationship from me and my brothers relationship but my sister always turns against me when we talk about holidays and arrangements (even though I offer spending it separately so they don\u2019t have to see each other). \nMy sister has a best friend who always does anything she wants and my sister prefers her over everyone else. \nI\u2019m always the one making all the effort with my sister - calling; texting, visiting, and everything else. Every time there is some inconvenience she threatens she would cut me off. I asked her many times if she cares about our relationship and she confirmed she does but I don\u2019t see it. I really don\u2019t know what to do anymore, in spite all my efforts and therapy she always ends up saying the most hurtful things such as she wishes she would cut me off. Since I only have my siblings and a very elderly grandma, I really don\u2019t want to lose her but she\u2019s making me miserable or shall I say this situation does..","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678658890.0},{"title":"I\u2019m being currently abused, please help me","author":"Calm_Range_2398","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11pj68v\/im_being_currently_abused_please_help_me\/","text":"Hi, I\u2019m a 16yrs old female, I live in London but I was lied to and bought to Jordan by my abusive family, I\u2019ve been locked in a house in jordan without being allowed out or education for almost 4 months.\nIm being abused daily, emotionally and physically, I really am scared and I need help, I have no one to help me, I\u2019ve contacted my social worker and contacted several embassies but I don\u2019t think they will move till I make some noise, I\u2019m really alone, I\u2019ve tried killing myself several times whilst I\u2019ve been locked away In this house.\nI grew up being sexually abused, and beat up daily, now I\u2019m almost a adult, and nothing has changed, I\u2019m still a slave, locked away with no help, please save me.\nPlease help me make noise and get people to listen to my story \nIm tired this is my last hope.\nPlease help share my story on Twitter","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678639601.0},{"title":"How to remember things?","author":"itsucksright","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11psumd\/how_to_remember_things\/","text":"I have forgotten A LOT about my childhood, it's like it's nowhere to be found.

It's not just one person treating you like dirt. (Which is bad enough.) It's a context of maltreatment, normalized from infancy onward. \n\nAbusive families groom their children to be victims. The whole family works together to gaslight the child into believing the hurtful, unstable, and enabling family dynamics are normal and *the child* is the abnormal one for being upset. The child learns to distrust their instincts about safe and unsafe people, leaving them prone to re-victimization even in adulthood. \n\nAlso, abusive families tend to select abusive non-family caregivers. Cruel and narcissistic doctors, dentists, teachers, babysitters, etc., reinforce the idea that the child deserves to be victimized. Of course, this selection bias isn't always conscious; rather, abusive parents don't filter out predatory childcare candidates (because they don't recognize predatory behavior as harmful in the first place). And most abusers aren't picky. They'll take any victim they can get. Plus, some abusive parents *do* purposely select caregivers with neglectful\/enabling traits who will turn a blind eye to signs of child abuse. \n\nThe child doesn't know this, though. They just know they're being treated like garbage and (quite logically) assume it's their own fault. Think about it. What if you woke up tomorrow and everyone treated you like crap? You'd assume you did something to offend them. After all, what are the odds that you're right and everyone else is wrong? But in the case of abuse, you are, in fact, surrounded by buttholes. And it's NOT random. It's carefully orchestrated and\/or the natural consequence of parents failing to protect their own children.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678572543.0},{"title":"Feel like I'm going to self delete ' advice needed","author":"Bitter-Ambition4375","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11pzgm3\/feel_like_im_going_to_self_delete_advice_needed\/","text":"I am trying to go no contact for the third time, struggling with homelessness before and had no where to go but nmoms home.

My dad is super traumatized from the sudden death of his dad when he was young and I know my mum had challenging parents. \n\nMy brother was abused by a family friend when he was young and my parents knew nothing about it until he finally told them decades later. He told me so I knew about it but we were both children. \n\nBoth me and my brother have been in therapy since last year. My first batch finished in January and his is ongoing. I was suffering from intense anxiety, panic attacks, depression, confusion about my emotions and therapy has been incredible. I have so much clarity now and I\u2019v been able to develop much healthier coping mechanisms to deal with my emotions. My brother is also doing really well in therapy. \n\nThe dynamic was I was the GC and he was the SG, because I was \u2018easy\u2019 and my brother acted out his trauma with drugs and alcohol. Therapy has shown me what a people-pleasing, fawning, mediator I had learned to be. I very often was the mediator in family issues, especially with my parents. \n\nThe confusion comes from the fact that they were good at some things, they kept a safe, stable home, were always in good jobs, kept us well fed, took us on holidays and seemed to care about what we did. They were good at the practical stuff. But emotionally they were chaos. My dad was volatile, unpredictable (one minute full of fun and the next aggressive), hypocritical, never wrong (it was always someone else\u2019s fault), loud and angry (holes would get punched in the wall). My mother was loving but also needed everything to be her way. She also enabled my dad and my brother, bending over backwards to meet their needs at the expense of herself. They are both very giving but in a Co-dependent, martyr-ish way. The worst dynamic was\/is their relationship to money. Both have severe trauma related to money, there were frequently huge arguments over secret credit cards, discovery of hidden debt and both would revert to their childhood selves if money was the issue. I became the mediator for these arguments and as I grew and developed my strategy would change. When I was young I would scream and cry to try to get them to stop. As I got older I would take on the role of therapist and quite literally be the only adult in the room.\n\nWe get told \u2018we\u2019ve sacrificed so much for you\u2019 and the existence of our feelings is seen as an attack if they\u2019re not positive. \n\nRecently the result of mine and my brother\u2019s therapy has led to being open with our mother about how neither of us have a close relationship with our dad because of his narcissistic traits. I told her he feels more like my older brother than my dad, he\u2019s reactive, often mean if he feels slighted and unreliable emotionally. I told her I don\u2019t feel emotionally safe opening up to him.\n\nShe seemed to be accepting of this and has admitted that she believes he\u2019s stuck emotionally at the age he was traumatised. She says he always blames her for things that are his responsibility. They have a weird parent\/child style dynamic, where he defers responsibility for many things to her, stuff like money management, bill paying, communicating with his children. He hides behind her and doesn\u2019t lead. \n\nTonight was the first time she\u2019s screamed at me since I was a child and it was triggered by me \u2018not trying hard enough\u2019 with my dad to reach him emotionally and for standing my ground when it came to my feeling that he is emotionally unsafe for me. She quite literally seemed to lose her mind, I was told \u2018therapy has ruined me\u2019, \u2018I am destroying our family\u2019, she threatened that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see my nephew any more (he currently lives with them along with my brother and his wife, a situation out of their control meant they had to leave their country of residence and temporarily move in with our parents), she threatened to cut me out of the family if I \u2018continue being this way\u2019. \n\nI was meant to be staying at their house, but I decided to leave quietly and go to a friends. Unfortunately my brother told them I was going and my mother followed me out to my car and climbed inside to have a \u2018conversation\u2019 which was basically her telling me that I was being awful. I surprised myself with how calm and rational I was able to be during this entire thing, I feel like therapy has given me so many tools to deal with previously triggering situations. \n\nAnyway, I escaped! And then received messages like \u2018I feel emotionally traumatized by this, I am crying\u2019. I said \u2018maybe you scared yourself with your screaming\u2019. \n\nI feel pretty solid in my sense of self with this, but I\u2019m wrestling with guilt that I should be trying harder with them because they\u2019ve \u2018done so much\u2019 and \u2018aren\u2019t all bad\u2019.

Something else?","author":"FiveOfThose","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ppam5\/is_this_narcissism_something_else\/","text":"Hi, I've been a lurker for a while. I haven't posted cause my sibling uses this board and is a narcissist (they're obviously in denial. And, no, I don't know the username, sorry. I would report them if I did. They are a total piece of work.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad, deceased, was a narcissist. He was incredibly aggressive and combative with my sibling. It was awful. My sibling, in turn, took things out on me and engaged in pretty severe, and sometimes pretty deranged, kinds of abuse. It was something they were able to keep private though, and I was so gas lit and damaged from a young age that I couldn't really even understand it wasn't my fault or even that it wasn't just kind of normal. Once I was older and had a lot of therapy, however, I was able to start trying to put up boundaries. Sibling, naturally, did not like this, since I think I was the primary source. Things got messy when I refused to retract my accusations, particularly with my mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I reflect on how my mom has responded to the whole situation, I have started to wonder if she might also be narcissistic? Maybe something like covert narcissism? Other times, I just wonder if it's more just generically being emotionally stunted. I don't know how much it matters that I'm describing it \"correctly\" or that finding the right words would even matter, but I guess I'm just curious about impressions or feedback because sometimes having a sense of what's going on can help inform the best ways to handle stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess the information I can offer is that my mom did the common thing of trying to downplay my accusations of abuse and sweep them under the rug. She loves her kids and I think she struggled to see my sibling in that light and knew that, if she did, it would shatter her ability to have her kids happily around her. Since my sibling is also so hard to deal with, she tried to pressure me to take it back and make it go away. After I wouldn't, any time it was addressed, she would burst into tears and make things all about her loss- how painful it was for her, how empty her life was, how all she had left was her kids and only because I wouldn't take it back, her having to live that way was my fault. I would later find out my other sibling has had conversations about not being close with abusive sibling either, but Mom still made it out to me like I was the only one being a problem.\n\nMom does the kind of thing where, when you talk about yourself, often her eyes glaze over and she gives one word responses, but will talk at length about herself. It's usually about work and how other people are annoying, inept, or doing her wrong. \n\nShe has a close \"friend\" she met on a cruise who is the age of us children who now lives with her and who she likes to treat as a child. I think of her as the replacement kid who is a stand in for the rest of us good-for-nothings who she did everything for, but who only complain to her about how mean she is, or whatever. The friend had an abusive family with neglectful parents, and my mom has talked about how she likes to give the friend a better life. (My mom does often like to share when she is being a hero or when she feels she has more evolved ideas or moralities than others.) The friend is condescending and competitive with me and says how none of us children deserve a mother like ours, as she is the kindest woman she's ever met and yet we don't even treat her like we understand how \"lucky we had it\" having her instead of her own parents. I can't imagine how the friend wouldn't have shared this with my mom and can picture that being something she would suck up like a wanderer who stumbled into an oasis and figure that's why my mom is so attached to her.\n\nMom's big thing, for a long time, has been pretty much how she has always tried to be perfect and serve everyone, but no matter what she does, she's \"always wrong\" and that people take advantage of her. She won't let go of a grudge and is really trapped in rejection trauma, cycling over and over old wrongs any time something challenges her. She struggles to ever take accountability for her mistakes and will forget or misremember events where she was in the wrong. Her go-to reaction when you try to approach her about anything is to ask \"why am I never good enough? I've tried all my life, I did everything for my kids, always cooked, cleaned, gave them everything, had NOTHING for myself, and still it's always all about how I still failed!\"\n\nWays she hasn't struck me as a narcissist, though, are that she can talk about ways that her ideas have evolved or ways she was wrong in the past (just only about certain topics that don't trigger her.) She's often generous with others, but it's usually motivated not for glory, but more like the co-dependent \"if I can give this person everything, maybe they will love me\" thing. She can say when she doesn't know something or doesn't have a skill quite comfortably and isn't threatened by knowledgeable others. She has her triggers, for sure, but her personal stories aren't the endless cycle of a life of subjugation and \"bad luck\" that I'm used to from other covert narcissists. That pretty much only comes up around issues of family because I suspect her own family structure was a big point of trauma, only to be followed by a long abusive marriage and fractured family relationships once her kids reached adulthood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have always just kind of figured that my mom was just emotionally stunted, is resentful after years of people-pleasing and doing a bad job of asserting herself since she has so little experience with it, and simply isn't capable of self-soothing. Some of our interactions though have led me to wonder if it's all kind of going beyond regular fragile emotions and into something else. Again, I don't know if it matters if I define it more than just that it matters I understand how she functions so I can remain agile and make the best choices regarding how I navigate our relationship. Still, I'm curious what others might make of the situation or what thoughts or ideas come to mind if anyone wants to share.  \n\n\nThanks for reading!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678653829.0},{"title":"does anyone else's nparent have a diagnosed mental illness other than NPD?","author":"zebrasanddogs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11pe52p\/does_anyone_elses_nparent_have_a_diagnosed_mental\/","text":"(I don't mean to hate on people who are mentally ill.

Not even as a young(er) child (I am 18) do I remember wanting connection with or loving my Nparent. I\u2019ve always done my own thing independently and followed my own heart\/forged my own path (corny, I know) independently of Nparent. Never needed Nparents validation, guidance, or advice. I knew they were a pos so why try to get input\/love, care, support, etc. from a pos?! I always knew Nparent was an irredeemable, sad, pathetic waste of air who so much hated themselves and had so much inability in dealing with their own issues that they had to emotionally pummel an innocent child (and other innocent people around them, of course).

I hate my Nparent and would never go out of my way to speak or interact with them. More than that, I can\u2019t wait until the day I can enact revenge. If Nparent was well-off, I would do my absolute best to take them for everything that they had. I eagerly await the day I can go NC, and I know I will feel absolutely no guilt, remorse, regret, etc. for breaking (the pretty much already non-existent) bond with Nparent, or for being PARTICULARLY nasty when doing so.  Idk, I feel alone in my sentiments and just needed to ramble about them, tbh. Funny thing is this is only but a snippet of the full depth\/extent of my hatred towards Nparent. For me to truly, accurately articulate\/depict my feelings\/hatred towards Nparent, I would need pages equal to that of every library to ever exist throughout human history, and probably like, a millennia- if so little.

Then, they a suggestion to text her instead of talking verbally. I have messaged my parent before because she told me not to talk her or not ask anything. \n\nBut, when she noticed that she wasn't hearing my voice and it was all text messages that angered her. Then, she stated to one of friends that I wasn't talking to her and I didn't even send her a text when the messages is what she didn't like in the first place. \n\nSocial services want me to the bigger person even though my mum is the adult and is one emotional abusing me. They want to talk her because it's respectful...I remember talking to someone, and asking if would still be respect if my mum treated them how treat me. They weren't expecting me to clap back and say to them and they said \"Well no\". Okay, so why should I?  I'm not broking her things or fighting her unprovoked (We have frought) I'm NOT just talking to her. \n\nIf you got more context from other post my parent told me to kill myself hence I am not talking to her and she's denying it. I got autism diagnosis and she admitted that she didn't want to learn anything about it. She had mocked for being autistic before my diagnosis and said that she doesn't want me anymore.\n\nI has two assessments with social services and I remember some stated that would find me foster placement. But, when I went have first my assessment they said finding somewhere so quickly is possible. Even, said that they find somewhere because it was put as an emergency. I'm still at home all my effort didn't  even matter. I don't even have a social worker to call and they all keep\nchanging.\n\nI can't live with family I have idea why but when I'm in situations like tbis all sudden my family or busy or can't actually live there.\n\n- I don't have there numbers just my mums\n- we aren't as close \n- or they live in another country \n\nSocial services also don't want to put me up for adoption and it seems like they don't want me in foster care. They're trying to keep at home even though my mum doesn't me anymore (her words) and I'm not happy here.\n\nMy mum acts different in front of her friend, boyfriend, and social services. She misses context out alot and hears what want to hear. She makes alot of assumptions but when I try reassure her she doesn't take no for an answer. I have told social services about this but they  all say same thing even I have told them she twists things.\n\nIt's like even though I tell them she twists things they take her word for it. I feel like I am wasting my time. They always say something like \"People say stuff they don't mean\"  My mum has told me same sentence\/insult repeatedly. do you STILL think she didn't mean it?\n\n\"Okay, but she's your mum\"\n\nOkay, but you're getting on last NERVE \n\n\"She cares about you\"\n\nShe complained about me eating food \n\nTold me my mental health issues were FAKE\n\nTold me to kill myself recently and in the past\n\nTurns people against me\n\nTells me people that they don't like me or think differently of me now that they have spoken to her.\n\nTold me \"This why you get bullied and no friends\". Because I didn't re frosted some mince meat the way she wanted me to by using water to re frost it along with calling me pathetic. When went to talk to her and tell how I felt she said \"If you want to talk personally take it personally\". Ummm the insult was towards me why the hell wouldn't I???!\n\nAnd digs up old situations and mixes it up with next I could have done something 4 years ago...she will bring it up with what's she mad about this moment then mix with something that happened last week or and last moth or a year ago.\n\nWhen I speak to social services things that I didn't think would tell my mum they did... I can't even make plans in private. I spoke to some people at a homeless shelter and went they went to camhs and told that I said someone want to adopt me and they told my mum and the household has been hell.\n\nFuck you professional you didn't help me or find me a placement. When it was an emergency and it was said I had a risk or being homeless. Of sick of talking to professionals and being laughed at.

I grew up visually not being good enough for my mom, and visually looking different from her, according to her I took after my father mostly. As an adult I take after both of them, but as a kid I was darker than her, culturally she wanted me to be light as her.\n\nShe complained about how my hair was thick and short, and which I know in these couple of lines some people might be wondering if I'm biracial but I'm not. I just simply was born to a very light skin black woman, she would tell me that my nose is too big, she would feel bad that I was short and that I had ailments like asthma. She didn't like my vocal quality telling me I speak too soft and squeaky which as an adult people absolutely adore my vocal quality and often tell me I should do a radio show or voice acting.\n\nThe one thing she complimented and I used the term complement loosely was she would be jealous of my breast because I ended up having really sizable breast and she was a bit more on the smaller end and she would always say that I took after her mom, and her sisters, and that the large breast gene skipped her and went straight to me.\n\nSo to say all that is to say that by the time I left her house, at 18 she kicked me out but that's a whole another story. I felt unlovable and I felt ugly, I felt that gross, I hated myself and the skin I was in and whenever I looked in the mirror all I could see where my imperfections.\n\nEver since living on my own since 18 being away from her also being no contact since I was at least 20, and I'm currently 32. I've learned that most people think I'm very beautiful, most people think I'm unique and that I should model. People think I have a great physique even if it's not skinny, it's still very desirable. I get hit on by men and women a lot and I never know what to do with it because I'm still essentially socially stunted as a person.\n\nSo I've lived all my life being told I'm less than because I don't look the ideal ways she would have preferred me to look. I feel as if I'm experiencing both imposter syndrome and body dysmorphia for people to tell me all these wonderful things about me. My face and my physical being and it's hard to accept them because it feels untrue it feels like everyone is just making a joke by giving me compliments. \n\nLike she told me as a child that she wish she had me by the next door neighbor who she was dating for a little while before she met my father. She expressed that she felt that his children were very beautiful because they have long black 'good' hair, light green eyes and they both had light complexions and were tall and thin. So for the longest those were my internal beauty standards and since I didn't meet up to them that meant I was simply garbage. I'm 32 now I'm leaning into my sense of fashion and wearing things that I would have never dreamed that someone like me could wear, and yet everyday when I look in the mirror I still struggle to like myself, to love myself, to see myself the way literally anybody else sees me. I'm sorry for the long post I'm just having a rough day physically in my body and maybe there's just one other person out there who gets it. It just doesn't feel like a topic I can talk about with friends now realizing that I'm conventionally attractive because I don't want to sound like I'm fishing for compliments I just want to express how much I genuinely hate myself and my mind.\n\nIf you read this far thank you, sorry for the rent I was using talk to text because it was faster than my thumbs","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678635842.0},{"title":"My wife has finally realized how selfish her parents are, and I have no clue how to handle it.","author":"Livid-Writer-6241","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11p1zvq\/my_wife_has_finally_realized_how_selfish_her\/","text":"So my wife and I (both 27) bought our first home last Summer and moved in mid July\u2026.then 4 weeks later? On her birthday? She gets a call from her dad. He\u2019s scared he\u2019s going to lose his job soon and asked if he, her mom, and her 2 younger adult sisters could stay in our home because it has 5 bedrooms. We were dumbfounded. \n\nHe\u2019s the only 1 of the 4 with a job and has 0 in his savings at all times. We discussed and discussed. I told her my concerns, and she told me to talk to them directly\u2026so I did. I asked how long it would be \u201clike 6 months to a year\u201d I asked if he planned on giving us money. They said they\u2019d pay us back for everything. I asked how they think the 2 of us in our late 20s can support 4 fully functioning adults as well as ourselves and 3 dogs (2 ours; one theirs)? They said they always knew how smart we were and that they\u2019d make sure to \u201cneed the bare minimum\u201d. I presented the math to why it wasn\u2019t financially viable\u2026they made up the face that he\u2019s getting 30,000 in severance 2 weeks after his last paycheck. They made up a court settlement of an additional 9000. They made my wife feel like it\u2019s genuinely her fault or responsibility that this would be his 6th contract job terminated in as many years; the whole reason she first moved in with me before we had our home was because he lost a job and found one across the country and just expected her to quit her job on the spot to move with them. \n\nWe tell them we\u2019re sorry but we can\u2019t afford that. We\u2019re sorry but an \u201cI owe you\u201d won\u2019t keep our roof. They then ghosted my wife after sending her a message how \u201cthanks to you, your innocent parents and baby sisters are going to be living on the streets\u201d.\n\nHis last day was in January. He had 5 months notice to find a new job\u2026but just assumed they were welcome here so he didn\u2019t look. My wife has felt tremendous guilt the last 3 months and I feel awful. But she\u2019s also realized how many instances they would say \u201calways put family first\u201d and then somehow go years without talking to their own. They meant put themselves first. I wish I knew what advice to give my wife. Her thoughts change by the day. Some days \u201cthat\u2019s how they are I have to just accept\u201d some days \u201cI\u2019ll just block them and be done\u201d and there\u2019s not a thought or feeling I can blame her for.\n\nLast week\u2026her mom called her and left a voicemail \u201cwhy don\u2019t you ever call me anymore???? Call me back hun!\u201d And that was the whole message. She just ignored that she ghosted her daughter for months and acted like nothing happened. Then a few hours later texted her \u201cwe need you to pick up your childhood memory we can\u2019t fit it\u201d and then got upset when my wife asked her \u201cfrom where? I\u2019ll send someone; I don\u2019t have the time.\u201d Her mother literally said \u201cyou don\u2019t wanna see me and give me a hug??? Haven\u2019t you put us through enough???\u201d \n\nNot to mention what they said to me personally. They called me entitled and a useless piece of shit. Said their daughter owes them for the rest of her life. Said that if they wanted; they could turn her against me in a second. I told them they should be begging me for help not insulting me. And that there\u2019s a reason she moved in with me 4 years ago and never looked back. I thanked them because without their selfishness and incompetence, my wife probably wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to invest so much fait in me when I really didn\u2019t deserve it.

I realized that I have a concerning tendency to seek out people's affections\/attention even when they are not good to me, and I feel like I'm partially this way because of my father. \n\nThere are probably perverts here who will get some sick satisfaction from this, but I need to get it off my chest. When I was thirteen, I started getting really into anonymous apps\/sites like Whisper and Omegle and I would flirt with and even occasionally receive private photos from older men. There were people on there who knew I was young and would offer to teach me how to do things like finger myself. I always knew that it was a little fucked up, but I only just recently realized that this behavior might be related to how I feel about my parents. When I got older, I adopted a lot of behaviors that led to situations I wasn't very enthusiastic about, but I'd keep getting into those situations anyway to \"prove\" to myself that I was attractive enough, cool enough, engaging enough, etc. (Sex related, drug related, etcetera. Even now, it's really hard for me sometimes to tell whether I'm actually excited about doing something, or if I'm only doing it because of people's perceptions of me.) I have recognized that these are unhealthy habits and I've stopped doing it so much but I have also started to realize how much I enforce these habits in my day-to-day life, not only when I'm doing something crazy.\n\nI am generally a happy person nowadays, but I don't know... Today I just snapped. Something in me broke and I started crying. I'm usually able to brush it off when my father is mean to me, but for some reason today I just could not handle it anymore. I started hyperventilating and had a meltdown and suddenly has this searing realization that he's not actually very nice to me and I just forgive him over and over because I love him, and because he is capable of loving me.\n\nThen I started thinking about how desperate I am for his affection and how I would put up with pretty much anything just for him to tell me that he loves me, and I had the revelation that this applies to how I interact with other people, especially men. He used to hit me frequently when I was a kid; at some point -- maybe when I was fourteen -- not a single day would go by where he wasn't hitting me. CPS has gotten called on him twice, once when I was nine and once when I was sixteen, and I recall hyperventilating and feeling so guilty about him getting in trouble that I wanted to kill myself to free him from the burden that I was. But then he would be kind to me a few hours later and I would not even be mad, I would hug him and laugh and be really happy, and just generally be super excited that he was talking to me again. I would forgive him no matter what. \n\nI think he now plays a really unhealthy role in my life. I'm twenty but I still have nightmares of him hitting me (he hasn't properly beaten me since I was sixteen, and rarely hits me nowadays) or yelling at me a couple times a month. I get hit with random waves of paranoia and anxiety sometimes about him dying, and I think I've built up a super emotionally codependent relationship with him where even just seeing him makes me incredibly happy, and even just a passing thought of never seeing him again makes me sick to my stomach. I've never had a more intense relationship than with my father and I feel like a lot of it is because his affection is so sporadic. I feel like I am always walking on eggshells around him and I hate it so much, but at the time I love him and don't know what I would do without him.\n\nI thought I was able to forgive him for all the things he has done to me, but very occasionally -- like right now -- I get hit with this overwhelming depressive feeling and I become deeply unhappy. I start thinking about all the times I've forgiven him because he's been kind and loving, only for him to turn around and be cruel because he knows I love him and I always will. And then I start feeling rage at how unfair it is to love someone who is mean to you. \n\nIt's also made me deeply afraid of men and I think it's why I don't want to form any real relationships with men. I have guy friends whom I cherish very much, but I'm very much not a \"relationship person\" and it's because I don't think I would be treated well or like anything other than an object. I just don't have any good experiences with men. My mom was literally beaten as a child but stopped hitting me as soon as I grew up a bit, whereas my father was never even beaten yet is the one with anger issues. My friends all have fathers who beat them or aren't present in their lives. I'm not trying to say that all fathers are terrible or that all mothers are wonderful because that is obviously not true and treating someone poorly is dependent upon individual character, but I also feel like I have built up some internal biases that are really hard to work through since I don't often see men being kind to their sons or daughters. \n\nI just feel really sick right now andlike I am a deeply fucked up person. I haven't cried in months but I think my brain couldn't take any more emotions and decided to completely unleash everything today.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678667311.0},{"title":"I'm afraid to commit to my future spouse's family.","author":"ebonywilliams0901","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11pucwk\/im_afraid_to_commit_to_my_future_spouses_family\/","text":"So I did not grow up in a living family.

TL;DR below because I tend to get wordy. I would love to provide context to my upbringing, but that would be a long post that nobody would have the patience to read. I'll try to paraphrase. \n\nI endured physical and verbal abuse in my childhood, hearing phrases like: \"you're <r slur>\", \"worthless\", \"why can't you be good at anything\", \"I'm glad your cat died\", \"I'm not taking you to the doctor because why would I pay for it?\" (after my mom blew $3000 on a Dior bag) and having my ex-military dad explode at any inkling of \"disrespect\" and belting me. My dad would hack into my AIM account, MySpace, etc. to read all of my messages and then scream at me for \"getting too serious with boys\". (I was a prude in grade school because of my sheltered upbringing so I know this was a lie or \"perceived\" promiscuity). They also financially abused me by selling my prized possessions for \"rent money\" I owed them the moment I became a legal adult under their roof (I moved out 11 months later) yet my mom tried to prevent me from getting a job because I'm \"too dumb\". Just fucking kicked me while I was down.\n\nI decided to go no-contact from my parents in late 2021. I explained to them detailed incidents of abuse that aided in my decision, knowing my parents would refute them. They denied everything, saying most of it was a lie (but not admitting fault to what was \"true\"), even though I have friends that have witnessed some of this and can back me up (most of us with n-parents can relate). So I told them, \"Well, since you're denying everything like adult children while I'm paying thousands for therapy and medications for problems you caused, I want nothing to do with this family. Goodbye.\" My dad drove 100 miles uninvited and shows up to my door the next day crying and pitying himself saying \"I'm a bad parent\". Basically manipulative stuff most of us have heard. I felt nothing, no pity for the man whose own hands struck me many times and crossed so many boundaries. They still send birthday cards and gifts (\"love bombing\" as I've learned from my psych) to probably try to \"win me back\" but I ignore them all.\n\nAnyway. So, my mother was diagnosed with heart problems and diabetes since the rift in our relationship. She went through a stent procedure and is now getting a pacemaker. This led to my psychiatrist and I to talk about how I feel about my parents aging without them or getting sick, and I told him that I feel like I already grieved for my parents while they were alive, since I was always wishing my parents and childhood were different entirely. I told my psych I was worried about being a sociopath, because news of their parents' medical issues should worry most children, but I honestly don't care and had a hard time accepting why that was. My psych tried putting things in perspective by saying, \"Why should you care about people who have clearly proven they don't care about you?\" and reminded me that I was denied medical care when I was a minor because my mom had other priorities than her own kid. \n\nTL;DR: My n-parents denied all abuse, my mom is chronically sick, and I literally don't care. \n\nAnyone else have similar experiences?

So, I've not been taking her phone calls, reading the emails she sends me, or allowing myself to be in the same room as her.\n\nDad was aware of all this. Repeatedly I've told him my intentions. He understands.\n\nToday was a disappointment. I visited my parents' house so that I could collect a package that had been delivered to their house by mistake.

I want nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"Why? What have I done?\"\n\nI began to list her bad choices with regard to me and my long-term health. (I'm trying to be charitable.) I finished up with a list of her most recent behaviors, including:-\n\n* Emailing a local newspaper to inform them of my immigration problems (specifically, 'outing' me as having no visa).\n* Refusing to terminate a friendship, even after that 'friend' contacted the police, lied about me, and caused me to be charged with and tried for a crime of which was ultimately found Not Guilty (because \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 I was innocent).\n* Calling me her 'idiot son' to my wife, until my wife said, \"Do that one more time and we'll leave; what's more, I'll see to it that neither your son nor I will ever speak to you again.\"\n* Telling my ex-mother-in-law, \"Yes, when he was 14, he pretended to try to commit suicide. It was just a cry for attention. He wanted a few days off school.\"\n* Refusing to pay for my son's plane ticket to come visit us, *after promising to do so.* Her reason: \"You accuse me of using money to control people.\" I did not mind paying for the ticket myself. I only wish she hadn't offered and then reneged. It struck me as unkind.\n* When asked to behave herself around my son in case the poor fellow turned tack, left, and never came back, she replied: \"Well, I barely know him, so it's not as if I'll be missing out on much.\"\n* When asked how many Jews she needed helping her with her oven (I'm Jewish), she replied, \"Six million.\" This was most disappointing.\n* Making snide remarks about people, being asked to stop, and wondering why people are so offended.\n* Last year, when I encouraged her to see a psychiatrist for her self-reported anxiety and depression, she replied, \"I was fine before you got here.\"\n\nNaturally, this was when she chose to interrupt. \"Excuse me\u2014\"\n\n\"No. Then, there's the matter of my childhood and the decades of emotional manipulation that followed. \\[Your behavior\\] has been an ongoing problem, and I'm tired of it. OK, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Which snide remarks did I make?\"\n\nI was surprised. \"*That* is what you're focusing on? I've emailed you. I've sat you and Dad down\" \u2014 I pointed at Dad, who was speechless \u2014 \"and I've read the list to you at your dining room table. We've visited psychiatrists.\"\n\n\"Yes, and they said there's nothing wrong with me.\" (She neglected to mention that her Honesty rating in the MMPI results was 73%. Mine was 89%. Dad's was 96%. Yes, we all took it, just to keep her happy.)\n\n\"Then you're not ill. You're just mean.\"\n\n\"How am I mean?\"\n\nDad finally stepped in. \"Enough! This is getting us nowhere.\"\n\n\"I'm sending you an Amazon gift card by email for your birthday,\" Mum finally responded. \"Don't you want it?\"\n\n\"I'll take your money but not your friendship. After all these years, the shoe is on the other foot, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I still don't understand.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on! You do this. You do this, over and over. You know *exactly* what I'm talking about. Do you deny it? Do you deny of it?\"\n\nAgain, from Dad: \"Enough!\"\n\n\"I know you believe what you're saying,\" said this raddled old pig's bladder of a woman.\n\n\"Why would I make it up? To hurt you? What would be the point? You're not sorry. Either you really don't remember, in which case you have dementia, or you're lying to my face. Either way, I'm done with you.\"\n\nShe began opening and closing her mouth like a guppy drowning in air.\n\n\"Put a muzzle on your wife, Dad, before she gets b\u2014\"\n\n\"Enough! Take your parcel and go. Come back when you've calmed down.\"\n\n\"That might be a while,\" I muttered. I turned to leave.\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nI turned back around and stared him down. \"You realize you're enabling her, don't you? You helped make this happen.\"\n\nHe had nothing to say. Neither did she.\n\nI left.\n\nI'm not sorry. I moved halfway around the world to be emotionally and physically present for them in their old age.

I was not a perfect son, and my parents reminded me of this from time to time.\n\n  Ever since I was a young boy, I noticed that my parents criticized others for things that did not make sense. For instance, they had a friend that whenever they went out to eat at a restaurant, they ordered their pasta plain, without anything on top, just pure, plain pasta. I thought this was fine, it did not hurt anyone, so quite frankly I did not think it was an issue, or that it warranted getting mad. My parents, on the other hand, were always talking about how immature he was for that choice of food. They would say \"he is an adult, once you're an adult, you should know better than this. Son, you will understand when you are older.\" This was not the only inconsequential thing they would attack. There were many many other instances of these types of things, but if I tried to type them all out here, I would have written a book that is as thick as Mount Everest is tall.\n\n  Unfortunately, their pattern of thinking was starting to affect the way I was thinking. Whenever I liked a particular person or thing, I would always think to myself \"Would my parents be okay with this? Am I a bad person for partaking in this activity\/being fond of this thing?\" This continued for years. Furthermore, I was never allowed to bring up any issue to them because \"There are starving children in Africa who have it worse than you, you should not complain.\" After this, I started to internalize a lot of my problems, but here is where my fuck up comes in. I had no friends back then, so I started to play a lot of Minecraft. I got very good at it, however, I would oftentimes rage. Every time I would lose at said block game, I would slam my table, and shout. I would think about how much of a fuck-up I was, and how I would never amount to anything. It sounds dumb, however, when you are someone with no emotional support whatsoever, and no friends, it becomes easier to understand. My parents would get really angry at me, which is understandable, however, they did not express any concern whatsoever. The only reason they got mad was because according to them, it was annoying. It is worth noting that at this point, I was already suicidal. On the other hand, my dad sometimes got so angry that he would throw something, and one day, he got so angry that he punched a hole in my bedroom door in my face. \n\n  Things did not get better with time. I was on a bike ride with my dad one day when he told me something I will never forget. I do not know how this conversation started, but it lead to him saying \"Smarter people are just better than less smart people.\" The result of this was that I tried desperately to prove to myself that I was smart, and not a worthless piece of shit. I started trying harder in school, but my dad would always tell me to do something with my life, even though I was passionate at stuff like math, he would not think that was acceptable because \"What are you going to become when you grow up, a math teacher? No. You will be poor. Learn coding instead.\" (Coding was his career, and he felt very highly towards it, even though I hated it. Pushing away almost all other career options because they did not make as much money.)\n\n  Things only got worse and worse. I started to lock myself up in my room, completely ignoring contact with family. I would get home from school, and play video games. My past seems very weird to me, because although my parents completely invalidated everything I felt, told me to ignore the bullying I was receiving at school, and ended up policing my thought processes, they did not really hold too much concern over my grades. All my dad did was work to pay the bills, and all my mom did was make sure I had a roof over my head, and was being fed. They did not give a flying fuck about me in any other aspect. My dad would generally help me when I needed help on something technical, such as fixing my computer. However, he did not care about how I felt, or where I was, or how much time I was spending in front of a computer because I had zero friends. There were no chores, besides the occasional lawn mowing, or me helping him fix his car. Because they were generally pretty relaxed about a lot of things other parents were more strict about, they would always rub that in my face. \"See how lucky you are?!\" is something I heard a lot from them. I also heard lots of \"We're very good parents, so do not complain.\" However, now when I look back at it, what did they really do besides give me shelter and food and a couple of electronics? \n\n  In Freshman year of high school, I had another bad experience with my dad. For some reason, my teacher gave us an assignment where we had to rate ourselves 1-4 on categories such as likeability, work ethic, self-discipline, that kind of thing. By this point, I had already made a couple of friends who liked me, so I did not rate myself too low on a lot of the categories. I'm not sure exactly what I gave myself, but when the second part of the assignment came up, which was having to give the paper to our parents, who rated their children, all hell broke loose. My dad rated me all 1's, saying \"Let's be real, you are not a likeable person, you have no work discipline, and you have no sense of direction in life. My self-esteem was shattered, once again.\n\n  There are so many stories from my childhood like this. One part of me knows that my parents were part of the problem, however, another part of me says that I am the fuck up here, and that I should have been a better son and that I am worthless and should just kill myself. Why was it that whenever I expressed anger, I had to learn how to control myself according to them, but if my dad punched a hole in my door because of his rage, I had to understand that my dad was dealing with chronic tooth problems, which led to him being more \"irritable\" than usual? Because I've become better at standing up for myself, they've mellowed out a bit, however, they still are not perfect (Which I do not expect anyway to be). Very recently, when I finished my freshman year of college, I got angry with my dad and shouted at him, which is once again, probably my fault. However, because of this one incident, he decided to sit me down while shouting at me, saying that \"You've been angry recently. Do we need to increase your medication?\" I told them all the negative impacts they had on me, and what they did to have those impacts, and how I now hold some resentment towards them. I essentially told them what I have written above, plus a few more things that I am too lazy to write. Instead of coming to any form of understanding, my dad said \"Is this a joke? You cannot hold resentment towards someone because of something they did in the past, especially your parents.\" I got angry at them again for this, and once again, they responded to my anger towards their lack of understanding by saying that I needed to control myself. It is worth noting that this entire conversation happened while I was tripping on 2 grams mushrooms, which made it feel all the more intense. \n\n It's all so confusing. I keep thinking to myself, what if this is all my fault, and I am a total piece of shit for raging at my computer, and I should have just learned to control myself? What if the long period of time I had no friends was not due to social anxiety, but rather because I was unlikeable? I have huge problems with self-esteem now, and I have major social anxiety. I just don't know what to do.

Just the other day, I had a huge fight with my nMother over... I don't know what, still. She started insulting me completely unprovoked because I wouldn't share personal\/private info with her, and that upset her apparently, so it warranted one-sided attacks (really nasty shit too, straight up saying I was a burden and ruined her life dreams\/aspirations and so on, but not directly of course not, just in that disgusting indirect way where nothing is worded specifically but you get the idea anyway). When I tried to defend myself, I was the asshole\/ungrateful cunt.\n\nAs a last resort I tried contacting my father (who I'm pretty sure is a narc as well), who is the last person I would, ever, in any situation, talk to, but I was this desperate, and instead of helping me out or giving me some comfort to that situation or anything, his choice for a course of action was to berate me further, call me ungrateful (I have a lot to be grateful for I guess), call me a \"trouble child\" (they're not \"trouble parents\" though, they're perfect little angels who struggled and sacrificed a lot), screamed, was aggressive and punching shit around me half the conversation (but he's not an aggressive person according to his own words, nor does he talk in an aggressive way, he's just \"assertive\" and \"real\"), threatened to kill me, and the icing on the cake, when I simply asked why she was allowed to just attack me unprovoked, it's because \"she is very stressed lately and has been going through a rough time\", which apparently absolves her of any wrong and makes it right for her to use me as an emotional punching bag.\n\nAnd when I asked why I wasn't allowed an apology either, or mention the fact that she has never once apologized for anything to me before, I get the \"but have YOU ever apologized for anything?\". Why.. yes. Yes I have actually.

I often still apologize in an 'empty' way a lot to just stop any confrontation because it's what I learned to do, but I am also working on that and being more genuine. It's more than I could ever say for these two sorry suds though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[conclusion\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the best part in all of this?\n\nI had to be the one to apologize in the end... to both of them. I didn't mean shit though. I just wanted the conflict to stop. They can both go fuck themselves.\n\nI was never given an apology. Not ONE. Not through the whole conflicts with both of them, not after, not ever in my life.

Over the years I have picked up on something that she does during arguments, that happened again recently, that I was wondering if your parents do the same thing too.\n\nSo we've been arguing more recently over the fact that on Jan 1st she told me that I am now 18 and it's a new year and that her legal responsibilities are done and she'll give me until the end of March to pay her a ridiculous amount of money per month to stay with her.\n\nBasically she expects me to pay 50% of my salary to her.

To make it more digestible, I\u2019ll be breaking it down into sections and [I will even read this post aloud so you can listen.] (https:\/\/voca.ro\/19E7Zxz3Wp6A)\n\n\nI also want to acknowledge the fact that my family is financially privileged. I know I\u2019m incredibly lucky to have reaped the benefits of the stability thus far. That said, please keep an open mind as you read. \n\n\nI\u2019ve tried to give credit where it\u2019s due in order to keep this as unbiased as possible. \n\n\n**Some background information on her** \n\n\nMy mom grew up in a small village in China. She earned scholarships and has two Master\u2019s degrees. Once she came to America, she started up a business with her first husband then her second husband (my Dad). That said, she didn\u2019t do much with my Dad\u2019s company according to him. She mostly just invested in real estate and flipped. When they divorced, she got a lot of money. This money generated a hefty amount of passive income which my mother invested into other properties - only expanding her wealth. As a consequence, she hasn\u2019t worked a single day throughout my childhood. She basically just played tennis, socialized, and we cooked dinner together. The only time she started working was 6 months ago which I\u2019ll get more into later. \n\n\n**My Childhood** \n\n\nMy mother took excellent mechanical care of me. She taught me how to cook at 14, showed me how to shop smart, do laundry, kept the house clean, and even paid for private singing lessons that I asked for. I practiced 1-2 hours a day and only stopped when I was no longer interested in music. When college came around, she paid for my classes. They\u2019re quite cheap in Canada and textbooks are free because I\u2019m legally blind. I did well in school. \n\n\nThat being said, whenever it comes to anything emotional, that\u2019s where things are different. I don\u2019t remember all the \u201cepisodes\u201d so to speak, but I have vivid memories of my mother screaming at me. She\u2019d say I\u2019m \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d whenever I dared to tell her that I\u2019m afraid of her. She\u2019d scream and say that I\u2019m \u201centitled\u201d, \u201cspoiled\u201d, \u201cdisrespectful\u201d despite doing all the cooking and cleaning for over a year when Covid began. I\u2019d try *so hard* to please her but *nothing was ever enough.* \n\n\nAnytime I\u2019d step out of line, such as wanting to visit my ex-boyfriend despite her not liking him, she\u2019d scream and scream at me, threaten to take my phone, pull my hair, and threaten to call the police on me. The ex and I broke up for other reasons, but her reaction to me wanting to be with him was so out of whack. (I only wanted to visit him on weekends.) \n\n\nThe most recent episode happened a year and a half ago.\n\n\nFor context, this situation began after I did all the cooking and I was tired from studying for my classes. Mom asked me to get her potato out of the oven. I went to her door and said: \u201cMom, it\u2019s your potato. I\u2019m not getting it for you.\u201d She cornered me and screamed her regular phrases: \u201cI\u2019m entitled, spoiled, disrespectful.\u201d The only difference was, I\u2019ve been doing most of the chores and getting great grades and doing anything else she wanted. I *knew* I didn\u2019t deserve this treatment anymore. As a consequence of the \u201cpotato thing\u201d, I barricaded myself in my room for 10 days, crying, and ordering food late at night and eating in my room. I lived for a year in GA with my Dad. Turns out, he was abusive as well. In some way, worse than her.   \n\n\nSince I don\u2019t want to type it all out, [here it is in my Discord messages.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/CXjlnJG)\n\n\nOverall, episodes like this would happen once a year or less. \u201cMini explosions\u201d with her yelling at me and me running and hiding or just standing there and tuning out happen once every few months. But everytime they happened, I\u2019d forget big chunks of time and seeing a picture would suddenly make the memories flood back. I\u2019d be so anxious and numb for days later. Throughout my entire life, I\u2019ve experienced an \u201cundercurrent\u201d of chronic stress while living with her. I can never fully relax and I spend so much time \u201cin a daze\u201d and slightly confused. I constantly feel this weight in my chest and a numbness that goes down to my hands, even now. It\u2019s only lessened when she\u2019s gone so I know it\u2019s linked to her. Day to deal, I deal with the stress by reading or writing a story, chatting with friends, and escaping into my thoughts. \n\n\n**What\u2019s going on now?**  \n\n\nNow, I\u2019m back home. I\u2019m working in her clinic. I\u2019m constantly stressed around her. One thing she insisted on once I started working for her is that she wanted to form a joint bank account with me by having me be added to her account. When I said I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that, she yelled at me for being ridiculous. She told me that we need a joint account so when we co-sign on a condo for me, it\u2019ll be easier. I talked to a realtor about it: turns out, joint accounts mean nothing since they look at you as separate people. Initially, she brought me to condo showings and she promised we\u2019d put a down payment. But out of nowhere, she pulled back and said \u201cwe\u2019ll look for condos next year.\u201d \n\n\nI work full time at her clinic from 8-6. Sometimes when she stays late, I\u2019ll go home at 5 and cook dinner and clean up so I pull 8-8 days a lot since cleanup takes a long time. I asked Mom if we could make bigger batches but she insists on fresh food everyday. I\u2019m so exhausted and feel like every drop of life is being drained out of me. I get about 3,300 CAD a month which equals to $18 an hour for 50 hours. I asked Mom if I could get overtime and she said she can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019d ask for a bonus for working holidays and she\u2019d huff and puff about it, telling me I\u2019m \u201ca co-owner, not an employee\u201d. Every week, she pressures me to work on Saturdays with no extra pay besides a small cash bonus. She\u2019ll later complain about needing to work so much and that I should be happy to help her on weekends. Besides two part-time employees, I\u2019m the only full-time staff member. We have lots of clients and the business is making good money. \n\n\nI know she\u2019s lying. Just the other day, she bragged to me about making $36,000 from her investments. Currently, she owns 5 properties including our houses and multiple luxury condos that she rents out for $3,000 a month. \n\n\nLast week, I decided I had enough. I told her that I wanted separate meals and that I wanted separate bank accounts. She blew up. She gave me the regular: \u201cYou\u2019re entitled \/ spoiled \/ disrespectful.\u201d She was furious the rest of the day and screamed that I don\u2019t love her. I told her over and over again that I\u2019d happily cook for her if she\u2019s coming home late but I *just can\u2019t cook everyday because it\u2019s killing me.* She offered to cook sometimes but it\u2019s not enough. \n\n\nAlso, anytime I\u2019d even *slightly* upset her such as having a slightly curt tone of voice, she\u2019d scream and threaten to fire me. It\u2019s exhausting. It feels like I need to perform in front of my boss everyday. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been silently planning on moving out. If she doesn\u2019t separate our bank accounts, I\u2019m going to funnel all my money into a different one without her knowing. I\u2019m going to book a one-way ticket to live with my friend. In fact, this very friend was the one who insisted on me making a post about this stuff to get more perspective. \n\n\nI forgot to mention in my voice version, but if I confess that I\u2019m stressed because of her, she\u2019ll tell me I\u2019m lying. In fact, she insisted the potato thing was just me leaving in a bout of fury. She never acknowledged that it was the most terrified I\u2019ve been in my life.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678594087.0},{"title":"What kind of tactic is this?

When I replied \u201cyes\u201d she stood up and raised her voice to me and yelled about how I \u201cnever consult her about anything\u201d\u2026 shortly after this tantrum, she marched down to my area and claimed that she \u201cdidn\u2019t believe me\u201d because she logged into MY bank account and found no record of the purchases. Eventually I learned that this was because the payments were still pending with the book company I ordered from. But, regardless, accusing me of lying and looking through my bank account was jarring. \n\n- Throwing a yelling, crying, falling tantrum when learning that I booked a hotel room with my (20M) long-distance girlfriend (19F) because it was essentially \u201cshacking up with a prostitute\u201d \n\nAccusing my girlfriend of \u201cmaking me have an eating disorder\u201d because I healthily lost weight.

It was at this point, when I was sitting outside in my car, crying, hopeless that I knew I needed out. My girlfriend and her family offered me a flight across the country and new life with them. 2 days later, I packed a suitcase, \u201cleft for classes\u201d and headed to the airport. \n\nSince living here, I have received countless messages and calls containing the ugliest, most manipulative guilt-trips imaginable.

So I kept on pushing the issue and defending myself, knowing that I'm looking like a crazy person, but knowing that I still (by my own choice and in this specific and particular situation) wanted to defend myself. I knew while I was looking crazy the narc would try and garner support as to why their comment was not a problem and I shouldn't have an issue with it.\n\nWe have been talking about it for a while, and when I look at the narcissist's prayer we are marching down the list of excuses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The narcissist's prayer  \n>  \n>That didn't happen.  <-- currently we are here, but they are pressuring to move down the list  \n>  \n>And if it did, it wasn't that bad.  \n>  \n>And if it was, that's not a big deal.  \n>  \n>And if it is, that's not my fault.  \n>  \n>And if it was, I didn't mean it.  \n>  \n>And if I did, you deserved it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have acknowledged that something did happen, and have tried to say that it wasn't that bad, which I've not conceded. However they are putting pressure to move down the narcissist prayer by twisting what happened to, once again, make me look like the crazy person. Also, normally I would just stay away from a person like this, however I'm making a stand, and I'm making a stand consciously to confront this with someone so that I have solutions for it in the future. Would not recommend, but it's what I'm doing. It's already taken a lot out of me. Narcs are very draining to talk too, especially when they are trying to force the conversation down the list in the narcissist's prayer.\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how someone could say something that just affects us and not the group. Since the narc is so hard to read, when we get angry at the narc, what are we getting angry at? Are we getting angry at the lack of concern from the narc at our feelings? How can we read the intention of the narc without getting upset first? Narcs are very hard to read, they have huge psychological walls up at all times, so when we get upset at their comment, what are we getting upset at? It's difficult to read their intentions, so why get upset? Why would I get upset without fully understanding their intentions first, which are hard to read?\n\nI think part of my answer is that human emotions come and go, and when a narc is talking to us it is so easy to think that we are talking to a normal human being that doesn't have such pathologies. It's easy to lull ourselves into the idea that we are not dealing with someone that survives on supply. It's easy to forget that we are dealing with someone that is hard to read, and isn't reading us, and that the things that they say are meant to extract supply from us like an addict going after their drug. We can forget and think that the narc is reacting like a human, and when they hurt us, and when we let them know that they hurt us, it's hard to remember that they are not going to react to us like a normal, warm, human being would. I think it's hard to admit that someone could act in such an inhuman way to anybody or to us. I think narcs are like crazed venomous snakes, ready to strike whenever they see an opportunity. I think it's difficult to think of someone living their lives like that 24\/7 and it's easy to get lulled into thinking that they are human and react like humans to the emotions around them.\n\nMy main question if anyone could answer and discuss: What is the phenomenon where the narc says something to us in a group that upsets us only, and how our reaction to it looks like an over reaction and makes us look crazy?\n\nCurrently they think they \"have me\", in that my reaction to them was an overreaction due to the fact that I didn't fully understand where they were coming from. That's because I didn't read what they were thinking that I overreacted and reacted to quickly, and actually that I'm the a-hole for calling them out on it. That I let my emotions get the better of me and that I was being the a-hole first.

When I was 12 he cheated on her and moved out to live with another lady, and I was thrilled because it meant that instead of living with 2 bad parents I'd only have to live with 1.\n\nI got bullied so hard in middle school that I essentially dropped out of school in the beginning of 8th grade and never attended high school a single day in my life. During this time I was 100% isolated in my mom's house, with no social interaction or education, just rotting away watching youtube and eating whatever cheap junk food she'd buy. Due to this lifestyle my health deteriorated so rapidly, I gained a lot of weight and my teeth were practically rotting out of my skull by the time I hit my early teens. I spent over a year constant pain from my teeth because my pediatric dentist gave up on me and my mom didn't book me with another dentist until very long afterwards.\n\nThe condition of the house I lived in was abysmal. She let her 2 dogs urinate and defecate everywhere, nothing was ever cleaned, appliances would regularly break and were never repaired, and worst of all there was a massive water leak downstairs (we lived exclusively upstairs for the last few years because of how bad it was downstairs) which made black mold grow everywhere and spread through the house. My mom is a hoarder who made me go downstairs and store\/retrieve things for her often so whenever anything needed done in the last 6-12 months I was exposed to a lot of black mold and felt awful for the rest of the day. My mom sometimes would come up with ideas for \"DIY projects\" to do to the house (such as cutting off the carpet in half of the room and buying stick-on vinyl wood planks to replace it with) and she'd make me slave away for days at a time to do them. Her response to the house falling apart was to buy more and more furniture and do tiny cosmetic projects upstairs, quite literally polishing a turd.\n\nBy the time I was 16 I was having panic attacks just from living in the house, the mold downstairs was spreading everywhere so rapidly and the water leak literally sounded like a running faucet. So I decided it was finally time for me to do something, I took photos documenting the whole house and I planned to contact CPS and show it to them. I was so close to dialing them but I couldn't bring myself to do it, and with that went what was probably my last chance at saving my own life.\n\nBy some \"miracle\" about a month later a lightswitch literally started spouting flames and caused a huge scare, which was enough to finally convince our mom to move us into a motel and then an apartment. Living in a clean-ish apartment was a nice change for a while, I was very relived but the physical damage of living as unhealthily as I was + the many months of black mold exposure + the very traumatic\/exhausting moving experience had finally caught up with me. I was more overweight than I had ever been, the symptoms of my POTS struck, I started getting pains all over my body, massive GI changes, blood sugar issues, etc.\n\nDespite my new health issues I was still pretty hopeful at this time because I had survived that old house. I was still 16 and I had a few years to change so I thought I'd just magically become a normal functional person and start working and driving so that I could move out at 18.\n\nFrom 17-18 things again took a turn for the worse. I started to turn to disordered eating and then constant substance abuse, both of which nearly killed me and made me a shell of myself, and my mom noticed both of these but responded with anger instead of concern\/assistance so I just denied the elephant of my room the way I learned to do very early on. I've never opened up to my mom about anything because I've never been able to, I got caught googling suicide methods when I was around 8-9 and based on her reaction I knew very early on to never let her know anything about my true feelings again.\n\nI've been spending the last year-ish trying to rest as much as I can and self-recover from these things, I've done a lot of introspection and maturing since then but I'm already so exhausted 24\/7 and when my mom pressures me to do things like get a job and start fending for myself I just feel like my life is over. I've already been dealt so much damage, I can hardly keep myself alive let alone be a functioning normal human, I made it a few years further than I expected to anyway.\n\nIf all of my issues were diagnosed and accounted for as they showed up, I am 100% positive I'd have disability income and\/or some other form of assistance right now and I'd have so many more options as far as prolonging my life goes. But since my family never cared enough to do that or give me any other way out, I have no idea what else can even be done. I am both physically and mentally disabled. I can't even go outside, I can't talk to people or make eye contact, I can't think properly, I don't look normal at all, there is absolutely an undiagnosed condition (or 10) preventing me from working and doing the things my mom expects of me.\n\nMy dad has been gone for around 7.5 years and just recently him and my mom have been seeing each other again. If it reaches the point of him moving in and helping her \"put her foot down\" to make me grow up I'll probably be out of time by then. I have no idea what to do when I've needed some form of help so much for an entire lifetime and I can't get any.

I\u2019m the youngest of three siblings. The oldest sibling has been no contact w\/ my parents and middle sister for over twenty years and the middle sister is the golden child. I\u2019m the psychedelic sheep of my family i.e. the scapegoat. I have been completely no contact for three years and I had thought I had them blocked. \n\nYesterday was my 45th birthday, I was fortunate enough to spend the whole day w\/ my children and my partner. My sweet family woke up early and baked me a delicious cake (this is a very difficult due to my food allergies). I was able to enjoy the morning without any demands. My partner and I have worked together to create a safe, loving, and supportive environment for our family. We\u2019re not perfect, but every day we reflect on our actions and try our hardest to make sure that we\u2019re always striving to be better than the day before. \n\nAfter morning coffee and numerous hugs from my young children, I was able to check my messages from friends who wished me happy birthday. I decided to check my emails and wrap up any correspondence I received from colleagues and such. When opening my inbox I found that my Ndad had emailed me from his email and my Nmom\u2019s account. Both headlines were filled w\/ \u201chappy birthday sweetheart, we love you and miss you little angel, Daddy loves his baby girl\u201d.\n\nWhat!!??? First, I totally thought I had them blocked, and they\u2019d never be able to email me? I made a mistake by assuming I had blocked them. Secondly I don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s talking about? That man has ruined my birthdays in the past. He tried to kill me via holding a loaded gun at my midsection on my 31st birthday because he couldn\u2019t stand the fact I was sad to be around them. He tried to drive into oncoming traffic on my 38th birthday when I was pregnant with my twins and in the backseat of their car. How dear he keep trying to love bomb me with such cheap trickery. I almost broke no contact. I almost sent a email saying what a deranged and hateful person he is. It really upsets me how they act like nothing is wrong and they just don\u2019t know why I\u2019m no longer talking to them. \n\nWhen I ended my relationship w\/ them I clearly explained why and how becoming a parent meant I had to protect my children from them. Luckily, I realized I deserved to have the same human rights and safety. \n\nI just found out that this morning my Nmom sent my partner an insane text asking why they can\u2019t tell me that they love me so much and that I\u2019m their sweet little baby and that I\u2019m a little angel who needs my mommy and daddy. They never ask how we are doing. They only talk about themselves and their difficulties. They have the cheapest possible way of communicating. \n\nYuck!!! What the heck is going on here? I\u2019m 45 years old.  What do they expect? They are dangerous and unpredictable creatures. My mom wouldn\u2019t recognize a safe man if she tried. She has no clue what I have in my relationship with my partner. She doesn\u2019t even care to try to rise above abusive relationships. She is an enabler to the fullest; she has allowed herself and her daughters to be abused during our upbringing. She adores my abusive brother-in-law and dislikes the kind men in our families. \n\nMy partner has said that he completely blocked them this morning and that he will help me figure out how to block them on my email server. \n\nI apologize for this rant. My dear partner and children wait for me to return to our Sunday family time. I needed a break to reflect and express myself. Thank you to anyone who reads this. Thank you for showing me that I matter and that I have worthy things to say. \n\n- The last time I posted, I was sharing how we had recently purchased our very first home, and how excited I was that my family could not locate me. Only to have a letter sent to our new address from my parents. That letter was promptly returned to the sender. They are dangerous and unpredictable, my Ndad is a retired cop, government official. The law enforcement agencies in my area are very corrupt, and they are absolutely no different from him. \n\n\n\nWish us luck in staying safe and hidden from their violence and chaos mixed w\/ cheap love bombs. I am both excited to know that my partner will no longer be the go between for them (he originally did this to hopefully be able to be informed if they try and find us). I\u2019m also frightened that if they can\u2019t communicate with him, they\u2019ll try to find me and then I\u2019ll have to go to battle mode to protect my children.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678642387.0},{"title":"Is anyone\u2019s nparents highly respected and adored in their community?

New poster. So about 2 years ago, I started creating distance with my parents. Clear boundaries. I spent a lot of time planning and working with my therapist during all this. For context, I come from a background of emotional neglect. My father was always just emotionally checked out and my mother had so much anxiety and insecurity that it spilled out onto her kids. I had the classic feeling of being a parent to my parents.\n\nThe trigger for the separation was twofold. My family never told me they were dropping some of their Covid guidelines at my sister's wedding. I'm a teacher in a vulnerable area, so I had to make an on the fly decision not to go, which legitimately crushed me at the time. My concerns were dismissed as anxiety. Later my mother tried to control my wedding, pressuring me who to invite despite numerous attempts to tell her we'd be happy for support but we'd be making the final decisions. For reference, I'm 30-M.\n\nFrom the time I started putting distance between us to about a year ago I tried explaining my feelings to my parents. Why some things from my childhood were not okay. My mother had made some kind of comment like, \"You\u2019re not saying we abused you, are you?\" Later when I tried to email a more clear explanation, she spent a long time talking about how she was suicidal, how she knew she was a good mom (I'd never called her a bad one), gaslighting me by telling me my memories could be \"wrong\", and claiming that adult children disconnecting from parents is a fad.\n\nSo I gave up and just focused on myself, my marriage, my job. Figured there was no point, I had to put a period on it, and move on.\n\nToday I get an email from N-mom saying she and my father would like to talk about reconnecting, that they've been in therapy for a couple months, that they wanted to have an official and respectful \"dialogue\", etc. I'm just thinking, \"I explained everything I could already.\" I'm tired. I don't have the energy for this. Sure, I could take part in a dialogue, but what are the chances that things are actually different? Are they actually self-reflective or is this just another trap?

Especially as someone who at the moment doesn't see marriage or kids in my future. Outside of getting married and having kids, there's no example of how to have a family or a steady support system.There's this profound sense of loss and loneliness that I don't think I'll ever get over.

Once year a family member got her a 30ml perfume and she outright walked away in disgust. She brings this story up all the time.  Mentioning that the family member could afford x, y and z but couldn't spend extra on a larger bottle and how ungrateful they are.  Like that's any of her business what other people do with their money. Not to mention, she has no right calling other people ungrateful when she's acting like that.\n\nChristmas, birthdays and mothers day become a bid for who can spoil her more. She does this in a really covert and destructive way.\n\nShe does sneaky things like buy fake designer bags and passes them off as real ones when gifting them. This has gone on for years and we have multiple theories about why she does this.\n\nShe NEVER asks for anything, but instead she has manipulative tactics that make you feel a sense of shame if you don't do it, she drops subtle hints that make you feel guilty and obligated to pay for things (usually expensive) as it seems like the only way to prove you love her and make her happy.\n\nRecently she managed to get her partner to pay for a tummy tuck, boob job, and her daughter to pay for a trip to the snow (which is infuriating as it was for the daughters birthday so you would expect 1) it's up to the daughter where to go and 2) she would pay), the daughter also paid for her air flight and above all this she was trying to swindle the daughter into paying for lip filler ... meanwhile the mother is also getting her teeth done at her partners expenses.\n\nOverall she hardly pays for anything, and is a massive mooch! But a mooch that seems to get away with feeling no shame and the most mind boggling part about it is she can turn around at any stage and say **\"I never asked for that\"** or **\"I didn't expect that\"** because she never does - she's that manipulative!\n\nCan anyone relate to this? If so please enlighten us with details because we really are at a wits end. My best friend is a single girl living by herself in a city and it's tough, her mum is essentially sending her broke. My best friend knows that she needs to learn boundaries but it's easier said than done, it's really hard for her to enforce them without feeling shame and anxiety.

My cousin's 18th birthday is today & my aunt (NF's sister) told me they were having a surprise birthday dinner at a restaurant.  I told her that I would love to swing by just to wish her a happy birthday, but I have other plans, so I can't stay long. We talked for over 30 mins last night and she mentioned who would be there (mainly my cousin's friends).\n\nI get there & who is walking up to the door at the exact time: my NF & stepmother.  He says \"hey, what's up?\". I was so caught off guard that I just said \"oh\" and walked in front of them. I could hear him chuckle and mockingly repeat \"oh\". Same crap he used to do all the time. I went to the back of the restaurant not really knowing where I was going but just trying to get far away. I found a restroom and stayed there for 20 mins sobbing and hyperventilating.  My NF apparently told my aunt I was in the bathroom so she came in there apologizing and saying she thought they (NF) would be late so she didn't think I'd see them.  She clearly doesn't know him as he is never late to things, especially when it's something with a set time like reservations and since it was a surprise party, of course, he is going to be on time for the main moment.\n\nI did take a pic with my cousin & immediately left. My aunt walked me to the car still trying to apologize.  I told her \"I know that nobody else cares he's an abusive pedophile\" and drove off. I still can calm down & it has been a few hours. We've been NC for 5 years & I have seen him here & there, but I always expect it so I can mentally prepare. I still get pissed he's around, but I can regulate myself and still have a decent time. No amount of sorry can fix this and my aunt has always known the whole story. I'm so hurt that she would do that when she knows how I feel.    \n\n\nI was so excited thinking that there was finally a family event that I was invited to without having to see him.  This felt like the ultimate betrayal and I hate how they can all just go on completely unphased.  They're just fine, while hours later, my mind is still racing and I'm having more flashbacks.  I experience dissociation that never seems to go away in general but when I'm highly triggered by something, it gets heavier and that's how I've been feeling since that time in the bathroom.  It's the feeling of being in a trance & my mind on autopilot.  When this happens, I never know how long until it fades.

Multiple other family members were aware of the situation but didn\u2019t speak up. They just watched and ridiculed me. At one point an uncle realized it\u2019s going too far and informed my mother. Mind you up until that point that I was scared to death because I was getting death threats from the person abusing me should I try go leave or get out of line. My mother then proceeded to traumatize me, insult me and tell me it\u2019s all my fault. How I could do this to her. How I could bring so much shame to the family. I was alone. Scared go death every fucking day. Wanting to die everyday. No help from anybody.\n\nI got into years of therapy and now I know it was never my fault. I was a 13 year old child and got out of it as soon as I got the courage at 18.\n\nMy mother also tried to use me for my money. Wanted everything the second I started making money. So did my dad.\nAt one point I remember him saying he would go to the bank and just take it all. He is old and delusional. Not healthy in his head anymore due to his age (70+).\n\nMy mom lied to me, manipulated me, heavily controlled me. Absolutely no boundaries. No respect for me, my thoughts, feelings or opinions.

Even though it\u2019s nothing bad at all.\n\nI don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t feel emotionally safe. I\u2019ve tried for years to talk to her, to build a bond. As soon as I feel like it might have worked, everything goes back to usual and I\u2019m left heart broken.\n\nThese are the boundaries I\u2019ve set:\n-When I visit them and they disrespect me, I get up and leave. I text her she has disrespected me again and I cannot let that happen. That I will be distancing myself for a few days and to please leave me alone and think about the things she\u2019s said.\n\n-If she keeps harrassing me via phone\/text she gets blocked. She usually sends me text messages asking who is brainwashing me like this and if she\u2019s never allowed to say anything anymore. It\u2019s always the same, she\u2019s a broken record.\nIf she calls me from my dad\u2019s phone, he gets blocked\n-I absolutely never ever tell her anything about my private life. She has never learned this country\u2019s language, never made any friends so she doesn\u2019t understand the culture and the way of life here. I was born here. We do not see eye to eye in most things because of this. Also she could be my grandmother. It\u2019s not just the cultural\/religious differences it\u2019s also her being much older than me.\n\nBtw me being abused was just swept under a rug. Never talked about.\n\nThe latest issue is she wants to go to her home country where I was abused. I went there for a few years after I was abused but luckily didn\u2019t meet the people who were involved in me being abused. At this time I absolutely refuse to. They want to portray the happy family picture in front of their own cousins and uncles and aunts. I don\u2019t want any part in this shit show. She\u2019s forcing me to go. She wanted me to go for a month like we used to as kids and doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m a working adult and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m throwing away all of my vacation days for her.\n\nI told her now we will not be in touch as long as she forces me to go there. I am incredibly grateful to have a safe space. She doesn\u2019t know my address. No way of her finding me if I don\u2019t want her to. Thank fucking god.\n\nI guess my question is how would you handle this situation? Anything you would have done differently? I try to be fair but my priority is my own safety always. Thank you.\n\nTldr: got abused for years by family member, parents blamed me and used me\/abused me themselves.

I found it odd and distasteful since he knows how much narcissism has affected our family including me and how painful the abuse has been. \n\nI went no contact with him in January, blocked his accounts on everything. Our relationship has been tumultuous from childhood, partly due to triangulation of my nMom, his own narc traits and shame for my normal developmental traits. \n\nThe last straw for me with him was still interacting with the toxic family members who have been part of abusing other women in the family sexually.

I\u2019m only going to go into the negatives of this friendship but I will say we shared a similar humour and she was a good text emotional support when absolutely needed. \n\nI was in 6th grade when I met my best friend in gym class but over time, I realized that the friendship was very one-sided with me putting a lot more into the friendship. In fact, never did she ever come to my house ONCE in 10+ years. When I would sleep over her house, she would ignore me and use it as an excuse to go on Omegle for male attention.\nWe stopped talking for 3 years in college after she made me miss precious time with my grandma who was dying at home to attend a volleyball game that her off-again boyfriend was playing in. I watched them get back together 2 hours after I was supposed to be home with my grandma. She went to nursing school and I went away for school and we reconnected by me reaching out on Facebook 3 years later - I missed her and hoped she had changed and wasn\u2019t the girl who used to take selfies and ignore me while posting them on social media.\n\nShe has a new group of friends that regenerates every 5 years or so. She had replaced me with the next person that could give her something I couldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s probably why I did so much - from traveling internationally to go to her wedding\/family\u2019s funerals as an adult to showing up at her doorstep with food and a card when her dog passed when we were 15. After she didn\u2019t make the effort to attend my father\u2019s memorial service (after he traumatically passed away and her knowing my complicated state of grief) in 2020 that was only 45 minutes away from her (much farther for me) and she immediately said no, didn\u2019t even try to pretend to get out of working, something flipped in my head. I should\u2019ve ended the friendship in that moment but I held on and even confronted her about it. She \u201capologized\u201d that I felt that way but doubled down that she couldn\u2019t get her work schedule changed (it wasn\u2019t the day she was working, she worked later that night). \nI was lovebombed by her entire family (and her) every time I\u2019d see them and would be told what an important and amazing friend I am to her. That definitely made it even harder to let go.\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s got pregnant in 2022 and we texted in the early stages. I was going through a breakup and it just felt like we were in different places and couldn\u2019t relate which is reasonably normal. She invited me to her baby shower not even a month after I started my first post-grad job (obviously couldn\u2019t make it). I lost it. I couldn\u2019t even tell her no. I felt scared to say it. I just ghosted. I felt internal pressure to go even though she didn\u2019t give me that pressure but did double text me to remind me of the shower. That\u2019s the last text message exchange between us (October). I was going through so much and had nothing left for this long distance one sided friendship. I couldn\u2019t mask it anymore (I\u2019m also autistic and struggle to make friends). She never reached out to check on me either.\n\nJump to current day, I muted her and her family on social media after the baby\u2019s birth. The posts clogged my feed but I did heart the first few pics. I noticed that her mom unfriended me and my own nmom which kind of checks out in terms of her mom\u2019s maturity level. I don\u2019t know why it threw me so bad and I know I don\u2019t want a friendship with someone who is so self-centred but it still stung that her mom removed me. I noticed she is still friends with our friends who we haven\u2019t spoken to from high school days so it was definitely intentional. \n\nIs it normal to seek friendships with narcs after being parented by them? Will I ever not feel the pull to reach out and make up some apology why I didn\u2019t message when I truly just don\u2019t want this anymore? Will the people pleasing ever end?

But I did it because my son wanted to have a fun time with his friends, and I wanted that for him too. The whole time I was trying to self soothe and keep myself together so these kids felt safe and had fun. The whole time I was worried about if I was doing enough, if I was coming across okay.

He had asked me the same question several times in a row, on reflection I realise this is something which would have made my mother angry and dismissive, but I just answered, reassured and didn't make it a big deal. He went back to play with the others but turned on his heel to come back to me and say \"you're really nice\" before turning away again.

The sadness that my mother has instilled that belief in me so vigilantly that I couldn't allow myself to feel anything more than a failure until a cute little boy said so.

I\u2019m still in university and not working right now, but I have enough to move out on from school money if I wanted to. \n\nI think guilt and fear are holding me back though. I\u2019d be so happy to be independent and take care of my own space, but I have adhd and my nmom has belittled me for years about always making mistakes, being irresponsible\/lazy\/inept to do things. I also have some health issues and feel like I rely on my mom when I\u2019m feeling really bad\u2026she makes me food sometimes still (I don\u2019t make her, but she does..and uses it against me later ofc). So I\u2019m a bit worried if I\u2019ll break down without anyone, what to do when it\u2019s hard to take care of myself.\n\nI also feel like leaving will be the ultimate betrayal. She says she wants me gone sometimes, but then says \u201cyou\u2019re just gonna abandon me aren\u2019t you?\u201d And seems scared that me and my bro will both go and leave her all alone (she\u2019s divorced and doesn\u2019t have close friends). \n\nI feel there\u2019s no way to leave without her having a breakdown of some sort. If I tell her, she may sabotage my leaving (she hid my passport once when I wanted to go to New Zealand at 18). Or she\u2019ll argue with me and try to break me down. But is it possible to tell her on the day I leave? I feel like that will be spiteful somehow.\n\nThe other issue is she\u2019s paying some of my medical bills (it\u2019s a long story of why) but I\u2019d feel guilty disappearing and using the money (school money which she\u2019s demanding I give to her) for an apartment. It feels bad somehow. And also I may need a surgery within the next year again and I don\u2019t want to risk being cut off from her good insurance before then.\n\nThe other thing is I\u2019d feel so bad for my dog. Most places wouldn\u2019t allow pets, but the thought of leaving him with her makes me sad. She yells and curses at him when he poos inside because she didn\u2019t walk him, yells at him for wanting to get in her bed. She doesn\u2019t cuddle or sleep with him, doesn\u2019t play with him, and will easily neglect walking him when she\u2019s \u201cbusy\u201d or \u201ctired\u201d. Having him with me all alone would be a lot though so I don\u2019t know what to do there. He\u2019s the sweetest dog and I love him and don\u2019t want him to be left alone.\n\nHas anyone else had similar fears and hesitations about moving out? It\u2019s partly fear I\u2019ll be unable to do it, partly putting off finding a roommate (I wish I could live alone or knew someone, VERY apprehensive about living with a new person and about them being mad at my adhd mistakes like my mom). And it\u2019s partly guilt of leaving her, fear of her lashing back or hating me forever. \n\nThis was all over the place but any advice or comments are so greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678567216.0},{"title":"How to answer\/deflect questions about your parents","author":"yunabear89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11or5e7\/how_to_answerdeflect_questions_about_your_parents\/","text":"I\u2019m newly NC with my parents and I would really appreciate any scripted responses that have worked for you to deflect questions about your parents.

I'm 28 and my dad is 70. He's always been nasty. However, since he retired about 4 or 5 years ago, he's gotten a lot worse. Here are some things about him that could help you guys determine if he is a narcissist or not:\n\n1. My dad ALWAYS thinks he's right about everything. Whenever someone proves him wrong, he goes off on one.\n2. Whenever something is his fault, he usually blames someone else for his wrongdoings. It's my 66-year-old mum that he blames the majority of the time, but he has been known to blame other people as well. However, there are very rare moments when he admits he's at fault. \n3. He gets angry very, very easily - even over the most minor of inconveniences. With most people, they would just shrug off a minor inconvenience. But my dad acts like a minor inconvenience is the end of the world and goes off into a full-blown rage. Sometimes, he literally storms off to his room like a child and stays there for up to a full 24-48 hours.\n4. He never apologises for anything he does, even when he's admitted he's in the wrong.\n5. Whenever he and my mum argue over something he's done, he sometimes brings up her past mistakes from a few decades ago - even some that took place before I was born (Nov 1994).\n6. He's one of those people who believes the phrases \"one rule from me, one rule for everyone else\" - especially when it comes to watching TV. When he puts something on the TV, it's always something that no one else in the house would watch voluntarily. However, if another one of the occupants of the house puts something on TV, my dad mutters and swears under his breath, talking trash about what we're watching. Whenever we ask him to stop it, he goes off on one of his rages. Another example of this is when it comes to spending money. He always lectures people about spending money and how they should save up, but he always wastes his money on alcohol at our local pub 3-5 days a week. \n\nIs my dad a narcissist?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678566685.0},{"title":"im trying to be close with my cousins to see if anyone can be an ally for me but no one is willing to be there for me","author":"seokjinmylove","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11orrye\/im_trying_to_be_close_with_my_cousins_to_see_if\/","text":"cant say i didnt try ! im a creature of regret and very easily ruminate over lost potential in relationships. im opening up about nparents to my cousins to see if anyone gets it but everyone is looking the other way. \n\nbecause i have no \"real\" family, i keep looking for family in my extended family but they arent looking to add me in. no one wants to deepen the existing relationships we have (which is already quite distant). \n\nit seems like i'm gradually hitting a wall with everyone. maybe this will help me when i move out so that i wont be too sad that i lost my relatives. \n\ni just feel so lonely. i want the intimacy of a person who has known me since i was a kid. new friendships dont feel the same. i want a family who knows me in and out.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678560631.0},{"title":"Nmother contacted me today and I spoke up","author":"_Pegasus__","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11okcvr\/nmother_contacted_me_today_and_i_spoke_up\/","text":"Need to vent.

I realized I could do LC with my family.\n\nHOWEVER, my largest hiccup is that I've realized that I am a trans man and I want to transition (top surgery and T.)

He would stay on weekends and then drive back home. My parents liked him and we all had a good relationship. Well one day they found out that he would sneak into my room at night, and they were obviously very upset with that. They sent him insulting texts and then started yelling at me. From there I locked myself in the bathroom and they broke in and beat me\u2026 I had to call the cops because I was concerned for my safety. The next few days I had to live in fear that they were going to kill me when I got home from school. I talked to my guidance counselor and the cops at school so this is all on record. Basically since then my relationship with my parents hasn\u2019t been the same. They degrade me constantly, calling me a hoe and how I\u2019m a stupid girl for letting my boyfriend \u201cinfluence me\u201d. For reference, I\u2019m 17\u2026 (I\u2019m going to be 18 in 3 months) I know for them it wouldn\u2019t be sunshine and rainbows to find out that I was having sexual desires, but I thought they would be understanding or accepting considering my age. Not to mention they blame everything on my boyfriend. They blame our strained relationship on him and say that he\u2019s turned me into this \u201cmonster\u201d. Through all of it I stay quiet and I don\u2019t say anything, but lately I just can\u2019t take it anymore. It\u2019s every single day that they either insult me or my boyfriend and I cry every day. I only have a few months until I turn 18 so I\u2019m hoping and praying I can get out but I don\u2019t know what to do right now. I try to de-escalate things or avoid them but then they get mad at me for not talking to them. I\u2019m also doing all of my stuff for college right now and it\u2019s very hard to work with them on my college stuff because of the constant insults and verbal abuse. I\u2019m trying everything to maintain my composure and feel like myself again but it\u2019s so hard with them in my life. It\u2019s taking a toll on me mentally and physically. What can I do about this?\n\n\nUPDATE: So today my dad removed the door from my room. I\u2019m completely devastated. I change in there, study, I do everything in there. It is litterally my only safe space in the entire house and now I can\u2019t even have basic privacy without my dad coming in every five seconds because I don\u2019t have a door.

You don't love me because you won't cuddle me! I always hated this behavior when she did this to me and I disliked it when she did it to my kiddo. With therapy I realized I can call out my nmom on her behavior and asked her to stop doing that. If she wants a hug or a cuddle she should just ask my kiddo if my mom can get a hug from her.\n\nThis behavior extended to our current vacation where my sister had to call out my mom for rushing my poor kiddo, really for no reason. It made me realize that, it's not just me, if my sister is calling out my mom's behavior in regard to my kiddo it has  to be a lot for her. \n\nNmom decided to kick it up a notch today while we were at an outdoor restaurant and kept telling my kiddo to include her cousin in their play. My kiddo was including her cousin (5 yrs) and I had already had a previous conversation with my kiddo on making sure to include her cousin. It's a fine balance because I also don't want my kiddo to feel obligated to babysit her cousin. The 2nd time Nmom asked in a span of litteraly 2 minutes, my kiddo to include her cousin. \ud83d\ude43 I calmly asked my nmom to stop because I had already had a talk with her about that. \n\nApparently I was out of line for defending my kiddo because she was sick of me \"correcting\" her behavior in regard to my kiddo. I told her what she was doing was wrong and I was going to continue correcting her. I told her I was going to leave and go sit at the other table and she could have some time by herself. \n\nI rarely ask for help but my nmom is the best at gaslighting so I asked my dad and sister if I was out of line? I also pointed out that my nmom did not get mad at my sister for correcting her when she was being mean to my kiddo. They reassured me I was not wrong. I asked my dad to please calm my mom down because I want to enjoy the rest of my vacation. My nmom did not like that I spoke to them about what she had done. Of course nmom can talk about me all day to my dad but when I talk to people about her, it's out of line. So she was upset about that. Classic hypocritical behavior.

She started the smear campaign against me and told our whole church I was possessed with by the  Jezebel spirit and also a narcissist. It was the most hurtful and toxic thing I could ever go through because all I wanted was one adult that cared about me. I never went to a normal school and didn't have a normal childhood whatsoever..I was home schooled and did not know how to do anything as an adult. My state had to force my nmom to put me in my siblings in real school so that we could actually graduate. So she basically clipped my wings and then kicked me out of the nest. I was the scape goat. My sister was a quiet\/ forgotten child and my brother was the absolute golden child. As adults, I have seen my nmom switch her treatment of us within different weeks...she will treat us all differently depending on how she wants herself to feel.\n\n Nmom and me have an OK relationship at surface level.  I refuse to talk with her about anything deep or meaningful. She knows I have boundaries and standards and she will not cross them.  \n\n So here is what i've noticed,  when she's talking to anyone that our family knows she will act like it is my sister - doing her a favor\/giving her advice whatever -  Or she will keep it so vague that it could even be my brother or a different person entirely.  She also talks with me from a completely egotistical perspective. None of my family members actually have names that would be a would be appropriate for mother talking to a daughter.  She will say \"my sister\" Instead of \"Aunt Ruth\"  And actually gets pissed if I used the correct family terms. She gets especially angry if I host small family I get together with just a people I'm close with. It infuriates her when everyone attends.

My dad would scream at us if we did something wrong and I remember he slammed a cabinet door once and shattered the glass.

I'm 20 now.\n\nThat whole fiasco traumatized me permanently, and I'm still very uneasy for when I get up and leave, as I take everything she says about me being able to move out with a grain of sand because of what happened before. I already plan to get legal protection once I move out to be safe.\n\nBut it's only just now that she's getting very aggressive like this, and I have a feeling she might be up to something, I don't know. I've dealt with this for over two years now and I'm very close to being able to get out of here, but I don't know what she might try to do, and this combined with me finding out that she's been vastly overexaggerating my ADHD and bipolar, and could have lied about me having autism has put a lot onto me to deal with, and she twists this to make it seem like it's my fault.\n\nI just want to be able to leave and live my own life, and separate myself from them peacefully. I've ALWAYS been opposed to violence, but her insane mess hardened me and I have warned her that when I leave then if she tries to chase me down like she planned to do before, then the full wrath of the legal system will come crashing down on her and she will fail miserably against it, but I'm just concerned that when I soon get up and leave that she won't peacefully let me go even if I have a job that's paying enough.\n\nEDIT: The plasma TV is unplugged and has been that way for around a month, so her claims on the plasma TV are really dumb.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678517886.0},{"title":"What to do","author":"dheppes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ogssd\/what_to_do\/","text":"Hi, I'm new to this since at the age of 38 I only just realised my mum is probably a covert narcissist with a martyr complex.

Before I booked it out of her house, she would spend 3 to 4 hours delivering sermons, yelling, and walking up and down the hallway like a maniac (I was too weak to leave my room, and she would use those moments to double down on the screaming and insulting). These instances made me realize that I had been through a lot of covert abuse, and that could explain why life had been so hard for me since I was very little.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little bit more context about me: I graduated uni with honors despite being type 1 diabetic since I was ten, struggling with horrible depression and an out-of-control eating disorder. My psychiatrist at the time didn't really take it seriously because I wasn't putting on weight (type 1, duh), and I felt really abandoned by everyone I knew. I've been able to keep myself stable and moderately successful in my professional life, but inside I feel in shambles. I also wasn't going out that much when I was a teenager, I don't drink and never did, no drugs at all, and had a stable boyfriend, although the way my mother talks about me makes me feel as if there's something I'm missing about myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still have an extremely hard time recognizing I was abused, and I even doubt instances like that count as abuse. I, deep down, still believe I am highly problematic and something is very wrong with me, although people around me that love me see the picture. Can anyone tell me if this disconnect, although it feels more like an abyss, is normal and if making the connection back to yourself is possible?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678556170.0},{"title":"Need support - living in my unfortunately narcissist family.","author":"EbbFantastic3894","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ogey1\/need_support_living_in_my_unfortunately\/","text":"EDIT - Asian, Chinese family \n\nI really need some advice\/comments.

You want to know what I never once did? Harm others, sometimes I yelled at my parents for saying things that rubbed me the wrong way about how they were wrong or straight up started crying, but I didn't tell them I hated them or that I wish they'd stop talking to me or that I wish I was born into other parents, sometimes I'd break down and start hitting the air or a wall nearby but I never once charged at them or at anyone, one time I ran away from somewhere without a particular direction because the music was too loud but I didn't pick up a hammer and break the speaker. You want to know what my mom did when it became too much?, She told me she hated me, she told me she couldn't wait for the day I left the house so she could finally be free (Same woman who normally talks about how she won't let me leave the house until after I'm out of college lmfao) she said she wished I was never born, she pulled my hair and got as many fast hits at me as she could, when I was hidden from her by a blanket or something similar she hit a random place intending to scare me (She herself said she meant to scare me) and sometimes ended up hitting me instead, she picked up objects and threatened to beat me up with them. I've never gone and harmed someone or something (Except walls and doorframes, a minute of silence for those) on purpose, for her it seems to be the default mode.\n\nYou want to know what's even worse than all these? All of the reactions I mentioned I had, the irrational yelling, the bursting out crying, the hitting walls\/doorframes, the running away, each and every single one of the things I described, I haven't done for months, and the only reason why it's months and not years is the crying part, as for the rest of it I haven't done any of them since probably before I turned 10, unfortunately I sometimes still yell at her but I'm working on stopping even if the reason why I'm yelling is that she's being unfair or plainly abusive (Mainly because it doesn't really help with anything), meanwhile she's a full grown woman and for the entirety of my existence I haven't seen an improvement of what she does when she's overwhelmed, if anything it's gotten worse. And yet I'm the one who gets told needs to work on their frustration management, not her. \n\nAlso the same woman who told me to understand that the reason she emotionally and physically abuses me is because she gets overwhelmed by me also loses her mind when I need gloves without holes in them that haven't been recently dropped on the floor (That comes up so much more often than it should...) in order to wash the dishes, but that's another thing entirely. I will try to avoid overwhelming her because I believe she probably genuinely gets overwhelmed and there are some feasible steps that I can take to avoid doing that that do not involve giving her my soul, but it's honestly ridiculous how 8 years old me was held accountable BY MYSELF and my mother for the actions I took while overwhelmed or frustrated more than she holds herself accountable for them. Also why even have a child in the first place if getting asked a lot of things bothers you? Why even have a kid you know will eventually become a teen if you do not want what you say to be questioned? Why have a child you will have to live with if you actively dislike interacting with people unless you actively want to?, I'll never know, I know my mother wanted a child though so it can't even be that she didn't want one but got pregnant accidentally and decided to go through with it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678515112.0},{"title":"I'm too enmeshed to heal","author":"spoiledcandy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11opi1m\/im_too_enmeshed_to_heal\/","text":"I'm finding it really hard to heal my inner teenage years.

Well, maybe they're right? Who knows. So you feel guilty for it to some degree.\n\nWell, so time goes on and you notice that what you did is never talked about again, acknowledged or forgiven. And slowly as time goes by you notice that a pit starts to just fall in your stomach. But, after a while it becomes unconscious.\n\nSo you notice that no one is talking to you, or seems to really notice whatsoever the things you're doing, how you're feeling, and it seems like no one in general is helping you. You begin to feel that this is an odd thing, consciously, yet you realize that there are more important things in life, so then all these other concerns also begin to become unconscious, a discomfort that becomes bigger and bigger and it becomes harder and harder to describe what's going on.\n\nSuddenly you're noticing that when you are interacting with these people, it becomes harder and harder, fear begins to grow, the people around you seem to be harder to talk to. Yet, they just seem like normal people. So it must be you.\n\nSo, shame starts to grow in you.\n\nYou begin to become ashamed, and you can't really explain why. Yet somehow you feel very strongly that you've done something wrong, are always doing something wrong.\n\nYou may start to, each day, try something different. You begin to consciously notice that every day, it seems like you are trying something different and you become frustrated that you can't just wake up and do one single thing, there is no consistency.\n\nIt is hopefully at this point that you may begin to understand, because of how you are constantly having to change what you're doing, that maybe it may not just be you that is the problem. Because you were pushed to a point where you were struggling and became conscious of it.\n\nSo that entire journey, that entire depression, the entire confusion, there was actually an underlying external force creating it and only when you actually were forced into a position where you are struggling just to make it did you notice. Who knows how long this took?\n\nSo the reason that mindfulness is helpful, is that day 1, let's say we entered the same situation. We did something wrong. Or did we?\n\nMaybe that thing we did wrong, firstly, wasn't truly wrong, and didn't truly warrant much if any shame or guilt. It was a basic mistake.\n\nBut then we can take it further and ask ourselves: Why was what I did seen as wrong in the first place?\n\nIn being mindful, you may begin to understand after studying the people around you that they perhaps don't even truly see that action you did as wrong themselves, if you separate that action into a vacuum.\n\nSo what does that imply?\n\nThat implies that there was some sort of bias set aside for you, or maybe just outsiders, new people, people that are not them themselves.\n\nNow, if we take that on it's own. What do we know about selfish behavior? Well, sometimes it can be good and sometimes it can be bad, very bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so just like that, in ourselves, we have created a reality that could possibly exist in which these people potentially could be a narcissist, because we do know that they do exist. And therefore our feelings logically are valid to some degree.\n\nMindfulness is looking just straight up at the things that are going on right now, without any bias. So, if we do that, firstly we save ourselves time. Secondly, we get to the root of the issue. Rather than the issue, which was right in front of us, being invisible, we can see clearly what the issue is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt isn't easy to be mindful, and maybe sometimes part of us knows that if we truly were to look at the situation as it is, we would find out all too quickly what's going on, and that would be very painful. Yet, if all we would have to do to figure out what is going on is to simply look around us, then the more painful thing would be to just let it grow on it's own until we're forced to look at it, not on our own terms.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678516382.0},{"title":"How to deal with narc sister you live with?","author":"patterned1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ok1us\/how_to_deal_with_narc_sister_you_live_with\/","text":"Long story short I've had several illnesses and conditions in my life, which being the scapegoat in a family worsened massively.

I stood upto brother about a put down and he said he will have me committed to a psych ward, and when I tried to mess with him to show him how it feels he then said he will kill me in my sleep. He also said the problem is you since your the one who gets in fights with every family member, not me. He is using me standing up for myself as a way to say im the problem. He then says that I need a lot of help. My family hate me and don't try and pretend that they don't. They use everything and anything against me. I feel ashamed at how im treated. I feel powerless and helpless that there is no simple way out of this. It makes it difficult for me to run away when I have medical needs as well.

She has told this to people over the years, while we were standing there listening no less, and continues to do so to this day. \n\nShe is the type of woman who will give you aid, but hold it over your head your entire life. I kid you not, this woman has printed off a spreadsheet dating back to the day I could walk of all the things she's paid for and I owe her. My \"debt\" for raising me. \n\nAs a kid and teen she'd have us sit at the edge of the couch and rub her feet for hours until she was asleep, as many as 8 (if she had a hard time falling asleep).\n\nAt 12 she had my youngest brother, she didn't parent him. Had me do it all. Aside for taking him to Dr appointments. I did the shopping, the cooking, cleaning, laundry (this including her nasty monthly dirty panties), iron my fathers work uniforms (military). \n\nRecently I got married to my beautiful wife last year in February. We just welcomed our first child, a baby boy back in January. \n\nMy mother has spent every chance she gets trashing me. Telling my wife how awful I am, how much I owe her. Has told my wife if she wants to leave me and go live with her that she'll happily take her and our son in. \n\nWe had our bank accounts fraudulently charged recently. We are 3,500 in the hole. Called my dad and asked him for help so I could feed our son (mom and dad recently separated 7 months ago). He told her I'd asked him for help. \n\nMy mother literally told him not to help me, that if he wants to be able to stick it in her when he comes to visit at the end of this month then he'd better not send me any money. She then laughed and said how I'm a piece of shit, she is happy we are struggling, and if we end up on street, that's on us, she won't help because I owe her for raising me. \n\nShe is trying to start proceedings to take our son from us. Saying we are unfit because my wife has seizures and some mental handicaps, and is filing for custody. \n\nAfter this, I sent her and email, a short but to the point email saying that I'm done. She is longer allowed around me, my wife, or our kid(s). That I blocked her on all media outlets, called my phone company and had them block her numbers. She hasn't been a mother to me since before our brother was born and I no longer will be having contact with her. \n\nI'm so unbelievably hurt right now. I am at work, crying and upset. But I feel a weight lifted off me. Going to take it 1 day at a time. \n\nThanks for reading.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678446079.0},{"title":"Im 22 I moved out few months ago I feel like people my age are just about wrapping up and settling into adult life and I feel like a child on day one in the world having missed out on a childhood and trying to escape this whole time","author":"Astraiks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11nw0fs\/im_22_i_moved_out_few_months_ago_i_feel_like\/","text":"Am I being too dramatic?

Lived in a really violent gang neighborhood, I was never able to have a childhood. Also, I never had a good birthday without them arguing. Starting kindergarten, my parents never gave my older brother (2 years older) and I any attention. I would always walk home from school during my kindergarten years with my aunt, who was in her high school years. My mom would deliberately make us walk in ANY weather condition to get her nails done or \"late\" from work. She never cheated, but she never wanted to care because it was less work for her to wait to pick us up. One time, there was a severe blizzard outside with a level 3 warning, and my aunt recounts that story as the worst time of her life but was glad I was safe. I recalled so many disturbing and hatred scenes from those years. As a child, witnessing the destructive fights throughout the duplex we lived in was the start of my PTSD. During my childhood, I had the internet that soothed the pain away. Playing games constantly and not caring about the world got me through that hell. My 3rd brother, born into the family, became the golden child while my older brother and I were neglected. They shift all their attention to him. I was grateful enough just to eat, but this was what caused my emotionless personality. I was super awkward and a horrible student before my high school year. Interacting was tough. I had no knowledge of it. Others would avoid me, I tried to make friends, and I never succeeded. The fights between my parents still went on, I remember those years I got a nintendo DS from my aunt, and that's all I did. My parents never bother to care about my grades.\n\nFast forward to high school, moved out into the first and current family home. I had to share a room with my little brother because my parents said he's too young to sleep on his own. Though he was around 9 that time and, like I said previously, the golden child. I failed my 9th grade year on purpose due to one class. I dislike that history teacher to this day due to his laziness. I only needed 3 credits anyway to become a sophomore , and I was still able to be on track and graduate on time. My mother quit her job to take \"care\" of us. This was the time social media was growing, and that's all she spent her time doing. Facebook every day. This caused more fights for the family. My dad slowly tried to show affection towards all kids but wasn't good at it. At first, I thought he actually cared about my brother and I, but a whole different scenario came up. I will talk about this part later. Anyways, dad side family had serious beef with my parents. It's mainly due to the fact they hate my mom with so much passion that they have their own arsenal of nukes to say to her 24\/7.\nThis was a major blow to my mental state. I love my dad side more than my mom side. They treat my brother and I better than my mom's and never cause drama. They're 100% daily and  can't tolerate fake people. My mom talked so much shit about them. This drama caused my dad to believe nobody is on his side. My mom manipulation caused him to think this, which resulted in him being her pet peeve. My parents made a new rule. Whoever gets honor rolls or good grades will get $50 and dinner. This was the time to see if they cared about me! I worked hard to get honor rolls. And then reality hits me. They didn't care if I got honor roll or not, they look at the paper and then looked at me like I'm stupid for getting good grades. BUT here comes my older and younger brother, they get their money and dinner. I was consistently getting honor rolls, but each one gets thrown into the abyss like I didn't matter. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. My parents still fight every single day of my high school career. Not worrying about the kids, just let us listen to everything. This caused an anxiety of mine. Loud noises would make me jump due to listening to my parents yell all the time. I felt depressed and useless. Actually, my parents called me useless and denied it to this day when brought up in arguments. Stress memory is real. They deny everything. And life is good? Wait a minute, my mom would always throw parties every single weekend like money is there. And I was always told to clean it up by myself. At that point, I remember being fed up and being a teenager. I tried to retaliate. It got worse when they decided to call me all sorts of names. They never gave any life advice, which I am glad due to the fact that they're not knowledgeable on anything besides being right 24\/7. They didn't let me work because my mom was just so lazy to do anything. Didn't want to teach me how to drive, didn't help obtain my ID, wasn't allowed to work, I wanted to save up to buy a car and move out after high school. My grandmother passed away my senior year, and this caused so much drama with my dad side. My mom is stupid greedy on what she wants. Since my dad is the oldest of the family, he has to take responsibility for the grandmother funeral. He decides to wuss out, leaving the rest of the family to fend for themselves. My mom argued that my dad should get all the money while they argued to pay out equally. My mom cause so much havoc for the funeral that she made everyone at the funeral turn against my dads family. So got dam manipulative. My dad family did nothing wrong, and my mom shouldn't be involved in those affairs. Currently, my dad's family is disgraced by the community of our culture thanks to my parents. After this big play of my life, I graduated. \n\nI was supposed to head to college, the biggest impact of one's fundamental life to learn how to survive. Instead, life hits me with a car, literally. Involved in a car accident, my life took a turn. I was hospitalized, and fortunately, nothing deadly. Only a slightly elevated liver and some lower back pain from shock. But money was involved. It's the only thing that brings out the true nature of a human. My estimation from lawyers calculated that I will be receiving 10k after paying everything from hospital to lawyer fees. My mother, however, only received 3k because she wasn't hospitalized or severely injured besides a few cuts. I was robbed. There was no such thing as communication between my parents and I. This resulted in a big argument about everyone, including my mom side, trying to take advantage of my 10k. Disregarding my being as a whole. All I wanted was what i said earlier, a car, job, and move out. I lost the battle of the 10k due to family that was supposed to be meant for me, I was obviously 18 at the time, but who cares, right? After 5 months, I got my first job at wendys! I was desperate and eager to work. I couldn't drive, and then my dad taught me only because my mother complained about how much work it was dropping me off and picking me up.\nShortly after that, I learned how to drive, and I regret it in a different way. My mom decides to do absolutely fucking nothing like I was a slave. \nMy older brother worked a warehouse and he doesn't know how to drive due to his PTSD and high anxiety so I had a crazy schedule. He works at 7am and I work at 730am. Luckily it was a 15 minute drive. But I get off at 3pm and he gets off at 330pm. The worst day of the week was when I had to do everyone's laundry at the laundromat by myself because we didn't have any growing up, so we went there every week. Though my mom had so much time on her hands, she made me do all the work because of her laziness so I felt like a fucking slave all the time. And the best part (exaggerating), she took all my money for \"bills.\" I didn't have a debit card at that time and my parents suggested that I put my mother to avoid the adp charge fees and she said she would give me half of my check daily. I was a complete dumbass to believe her. I didn't get anything besides $60 for car gas and food for the week. She took my money to buy her all the clothes and stuff for the house which somewhat understandable if she asked. But she didn't work for it. On my birthday that year I wanted to have a whole paycheck and what she gives? 10 dollars. That's it.\n\nThe problem with this was I was young and dumb. Still am but I believe I wasn't growing up property due to my ptsd. I felt like I was always controlled by them and never realized it. I was always trying to win their attention which grew colder and colder but I kept trying. Until the day I started dating my girlfriend. My parents  were super controlling. Being 23, there were these unbelievable curfews at 9pm, and the bedroom door has to be open all the time. I wanted to move out and explore with freedom, but their negativity and being right all the time caused me to be mentally in pain . It was like they had total control over me, and I never had any confidence. I was never taught to deal with the real-life situation. This is when I completely realized how much time was lost. I decided to move out with my girlfriend. My parents were so upset because they believed anyone was giving me bad advice. My parents claim that nobody can help support the family. Well I ain't no fucking slave if they treat me like this. My mom doesn't like when anyone calls her lazy. My dad rather support her claims than mine. My own dam dad called me the lowest that makes my blood boil to this day. He said I am nothing than a stray dog, like a slave and that's why I'm the stupidest one in the family. I completely lost my shit and moved out regardless of their words and negativity. There's a point where growth is needed and I'm glad I did this. I learned a lot and being 24 now, I look back and realize a lot more than I thought I did. However, my parents will always be narcissistic and they still act like they care. They expect me to call them, then get mad at me and would randomly call and scream at me for not checking up on them. I would answer with back coldly. \n\nI'm doing better now with my PTSD problems by going to the gym. Sorry for the long story, and thank you whoever read this whole thing. At times, I want to rant, and my girlfriend is more than enough, but I thought I would share this story with others who are going through the same thing.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678498608.0},{"title":"how to study with depression and emotionally abusive parents?","author":"Ok_Fudge_9250","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11oay5b\/how_to_study_with_depression_and_emotionally\/","text":"I just posted this in r\/students but I'll put it here too cause I need help I'm so fucking tired and crying so sorry it's just gonna be pasted\n\nI am a high school student and am pretty high achieving, always have an average of 90% and above the like.

I'm a 28M and have been doing alot of self reflection lately, trying to figure out \"why am I the way I am\"\n\nIn a nutshell I'm a super anxious adult, I find myself always worried about something, and seem to view life through the lens of  \"what if this doesn't work out\"\n\nSome facts about my childhood (in no particular order):\n\n1. Parents would always have screaming matches in front of me and my siblings, openly discuss their marriage issues, financial problems etc. From a very young age I found myself preoccupied with thoughts of  \"what if we become poor\", \"what if they get a divorce\" , etc. \n2. Regular screaming\/beatings\/silent treatment as consequence for relatively trivial things, to the point where if anything ever went wrong whether that was a letter home from school, or I dropped\/broke a plate, I found myself in a permanent state of worry, \"what are my parents going to do\" At one point, during an argument my dad choked me for several seconds to get a rise out of my mom. \n3. I have never been proud of anything I have accomplished. Growing up grades were everything, If I didn't meet the bar I'd be ridiculed\/compared to my peers. If I did do well, the vibe I received was sort of a \"great, what you want a cookie?\" I even had to basically convince them to come to my high school\/Uni graduations; these were not milestones to be celebrated, rather \"I've done the bare minimum\"\n4. An obsession with \"what will others think\". I was never looked at as an individual, rather a representative of them and the family as a whole, I was raised to believe that was others think of me is of the highest importance. \n5. My friends were always labelled as \"distractions\", my parents would always put this narrative in my head that everyone is selfish and trying to get ahead, my \"friends\" just want an extra person to goof off with. They'd go as far as saying stuff like \"these guys aren't your friends, they just want more people around to keep things fun, they are using you\"\n6. No privacy on extreme levels, always going through my room (looking for a reason to get mad at me), reading texts over my shoulder, at one point I was told \"you're a kid, you don't get to keep secrets\" The few times Id bring friends over I know they'd be eavesdropping, eventually I stopped having people over all together. \n7. I have never discussed anything of emotional substance with my parents: girlfriends, career dreams, something that made me happy, something that made me sad, something that has me worried. If I were to die today, they have no clue who I am past the superficial facts they know about me. Growing up my parents were not a safe haven, anything I was dealing with, I dealt with alone, or confided in my friends. \n8. I was a chubby kid growing up, and I'm still a chubby adult now (working on it), this was also something they would regularly make comments about\n9. I could keep going for pages.... But ill end with saying alot of my buddies consider their parents their best friends, I have no idea how that feels like. \n\nAll that said I still feel in debt to my parents. They raised me at the end of the day, helped pay for my schooling, and so much more. I feel guilty trying to paint them as some sort of monsters. I have a really hard time trying to describe how I feel, they've given me so much, but have hurt me in so many other ways...\n\nTo the folks who took the time to read all this, what do you think ? how do these things manifest in adulthood, how can they be worked on? what is the way forward?","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678496555.0},{"title":"Nmom going crazy","author":"schizostoner69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11o4cf3\/nmom_going_crazy\/","text":"So I realised my mom is not normal a very long time ago(currently 18).

I also moved out with nothing at the age of 18, but I was too mentally ill that they told me to move back in to drive my sister to school so I did. My younger sister doesn't like me. She may be ignorant to her own actions, but she has never been appreciative, which is fine, but she keeps taking and taking, and asking for more and more. Recently, I have been trying to work on healing, but it's getting tighter and tighter, I also have to help my parents with doing their dishes and laundry and cleaning the house while they are away. I always felt like I needed to be the protector for my younger sister. I was wrong. A decade later, she turned out to be the most selfish entitled person towards me. And she's so young, she really only thinks about Kpop, but it took me a year to mourn and grief her. Sometimes I still cry when memories of us pop up into my head. I've wasted years taking care of my sibling and the house and I don't get paid I just kind of feel like a stay-at-home maid and I'm thankful for the shelter and food and the car I get to drive and the card to buy my sibling food but I just wonder why I was born to be a taxi driver and maid. Right now my biggest problem is establishing boundaries. My sister keeps asking if I can take her to buy Kpop albums, but we've spent over $3000 on Chickfila already and I gave her $500 out of my own pocket for her Kpop albums, she is 14. I finally caught on to her manipulating, but now I don't know what to say other than to not respond. She texted me if I still wanted to go to Target to buy Kpop albums. The thing is I never wanted to go to Target, she does. I don't want to say no. How do I say no without sounding mean? I want to live my own life at some point, I'm 20. I am deep down in the gutter and I need to climb myself out, help please. I'm gonna make a few more grand then leave, since my parents finally let me have a job, which is at their own business. But that will take time. I need advice for right now.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the advice and kind words. I feel seen and supported. I'll solely be working on myself now. Minimizing as much contact as possible.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678468512.0},{"title":"I want to stop living.","author":"sleepingwithsecrets","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11o9eg4\/i_want_to_stop_living\/","text":"I cant take it anymore.

From nparents at home, to GC sibling, to classmates, teachers, siblings classmates, and so on. Professors in college too.\n\nFor example, I was getting tutoring help for math and coding outside campus. I was doing really well as a result. My classmates told our math professor about the help I was getting, so next day, in the middle of the class he gave us a surprise test, saw I was able to solve all the questions while others struggled, threw a fit and tore my book into pieces. Threatened me to not come to class ever again. I had to report it and the principal warned him into behaving properly with me.

Always loved the West and knew it would liberate me of many crazy societal headaches. When I newly joined my current job, my teammates would discuss plans after work to hangout in front of me but wouldn't invite me despite being a part of the conversation up until that point. Things were okay for a few years until 3 months ago. My manager lashes out at me, with my peers watching the scene. I'm the one they pick to leave out of comp increases\/new opportunities.

I have been on a hunt for a new job for a couple months now and it's so hard (thankful for a job given the market and grateful for having an income and not worry about essentials but my mental health is tanking).\n\nI am mentally exhausted from being on the receiving end of others' anger. Crazy strangers at the gym passing a racial slur, being left out of conversations at work, my own parents picking on me non stop, my husband's relatives needlessly making me feel \"lucky\" to have found a partner like my husband (they don't see it as something I worked hard for and that I am as good to him as he is to me) and all these just happen to me even when I'm surrounded by others. \n\nI don't know if it's my appearance or weight or my face or whatever but it's making me losing my will to show up anywhere.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678487412.0},{"title":"I uninvited my mom to my wedding","author":"torivanhorn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11n85h0\/i_uninvited_my_mom_to_my_wedding\/","text":"I decided on Tuesday that my mom shouldn\u2019t come to my bridal shower or wedding in a few months.

I am a 25f. I think this will end up being a huge vent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's always been my dream. I don't care about having a family or kids, or anything. Not anymore. I only want to travel. It's my only motivation in life.\n\nBut at the same time, I'm so scared of change.\n\nLet me start off by saying, I grew up \\*very\\* sheltered, and in a Mexican household. My mom was always very angry, aggressive and abusive. Physically and verbally. She would often hit us or beat us out of anger, and still to this day, constantly insults us. As in, when she speaks, there is always an insult intertwined in there.\n\nI grew up to be very quiet and afraid of confrontation. I never really made friends, the only few friends I made ended up ditching me.\n\nI tried so hard in elementary school to fit it but I was ignored. I invited all the girls in my class to my birthday party and no body showed.\n\nMy first friend was my neighbor who I basically grew up with. In the 7th grade, she suddenly stopped talking to me. She became friends with girls who bullied me.\n\nSame thing with a friend I managed to make in 8th grade. She became friends with a girl who bullied me heavily and told me that girl didn't want her talking to me anymore.\n\nIn high school, I became friends with a guy who I know see was manipulative and would constantly make comments to make me feel bad about myself.\n\nIt never helped that at home, my mom told me I have myself to blame because I'm 'unlikable'. It was always my fault I got bullied because I'm too weird and not social enough. Oh, not to mention I was \\*never\\* allowed to go out with friends or join after school activities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI attempted suicide twice, once in 6th grade, then again in 9th. Both times were just pitiful attempts with a handful of advil, so nothing happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's pretty much how I grew up.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I ended up dating my first 'real' bf (now ex). We dated for 5 years. He ended up using me for money, and cheated on me a lot throughout our relationship. Even still, my mom told me it's my fault. She says I won't find a better man.\n\nI believe this combined with autism, had turned me into a pretty apathetic, bitter person. I don't have much interest in being in a relationship anymore or having a family, although, it would be nice to have friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, now, up to this point of my life, I am still being controlled by my mom. It's all I know.\n\nI'm so sick of living in this bubble, I feel like I'm trapped. All I do is be at home, watch youtube\/ shows, draw, work. That's it.\n\nI don't drive. I wanted to learn when I was younger but my mother was very 'displeased' with that idea. I know it was to keep control over me. She would get very angry if I went to practice with my dad. But now, I'm far, far too afraid to do it. Even still, I am going to get my permit again to try learning how to drive. Although, the 'learning' part isn't the hard part, it's getting over the massive anxiety I get while driving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easy to think, 'well, just move out. Easy.'\n\nYeah I guess it is that easy. To say.\n\nI work part-time as an RN, I can't work more than that without getting what I believe are panic attacks. Some days it's so, so stressful, especially when I get yelled at by a patient, doctor or some family member. It's pathetic. I think all this anxiety and inability to function has been getting worse over the years. But I still, try to work as much as I can, to be able to travel and move out someday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is where my current predicament is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so SICK of living like this.\n\nI hate it I hate it I fucking HATE IT.\n\nThis isn't life. Why am I still so scared to go against my mom? This isn't right. I shouldn't have to ask her for 'permission' to go out to the mall or wherever at 25. I hate this but I'm so scared of anything else.\n\nI want to go to Japan at the end of April. There are some events for something I really love (special interest), therefore, I don't want to keep holding off and missing out on my life. It's not okay.\n\nI want to go. I have my own money, I have 25k USD in savings, that's okay, right??\n\nBut I don't have friends to go with. I don't have anyone. Except potentially my ex, who is trying to get on my good side again because he wants to get back together, (who I have no interest in getting back together with) who my mom adores.\n\nSo I brought it up to her. About going and with him. Because I don't care who goes, I just...need to go...\n\nShe laughed at me and asked why am I having these unrealistic ideas. She said it's dirty there and I should just go to Chinatown in Chicago cause it's the same thing. She also said to stop acting like I'm rich. I told her I have my own money from work and I'm not asking for it to be paid or anything. So she gets loud and says that's not the point. She said the flight is like 16 hours, and it's half way across the damn world, what am I thinking? Why do I need to go when everything is the same everywhere? I told her it's my dream to go,  she said dreams don't always come true. I said, I don't think it's an impossible wish to have. She just said, of course I don't, because I'm filled with all these ridiculous ideas. She also said only married people travel together.\n\nI feel like she wasn't taking it very seriously anyways, because she didn't get as angry as I expected her to, but I'm sure if I keep pushing the idea, she would blow a fuse. I've been thinking about this daily for months, and have been thinking about it for years.\n\nI don't want to keep missing out on my life.\n\nBut I'm so scared to go against what she says. if I push it again or tell her I \\*plan\\* on going, or just go, I really don't know what she'll do. I'm honestly afraid.\n\nI'm also afraid of going even though it's my greatest wish. Especially alone.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI feel like....this is pointless. So pointless...if I have to live this way, why live at all? I've been considering it a lot. If I miss this, I feel like why shouldn't I just end it? If I miss everything important to me...what's the point? Why do I keep living this way??

I've always tried to tell myself that after 25 years, I'm a grown man and that I need to learn that I can only rely on myself with my emotions. \n\n\"You're the pillar that's holding it together, so act like it and keep moving.\"\n\nBut I keep feeling sudden bouts of anger. Like I should be ashamed. So here I am, tying out my problems to a bunch of strangers. Felling very much like a child whining for attention instead of just dealing with it in my own like I usually do. But here I go.\n\nFor context, about a year and a half ago, my mother made me have a mental break down from constantly belittling me, before telling me \"I'm tired of your shit. You don't do anything around here, so you can just pack your shit and leave.\"...despite me paying for and supporting everything in the house.\n\nLet me say that my mom has **always** been an angry person. She grew up in a very bad set of circumstances. Not to get too into details, but my grandmother was a terrible drug addict at one point and my mom ran into a lot of scum bags trying to take advantage of her in her youth. To say the environment she grew up in was \"Ghetto\" would be an understatement of a lifetime. Everyone was either something along the lines of a McDonalds manager or drug dealer. \n\nSo you can imagine how messed up she might be.\n\nWhen she was in her twenties she had three kids, me, my twin sister and my little brother. And my last little sister who is about 7 right now. She was basically an adult in body only and my dad was arrested and gone. When we were kids, it was always constant shouting and belittling. Telling us we're always in the way, telling us to be quite, cursing at us constantly. If she was frustrated, she'd take it out on me with shoving or hitting me with a belt....it was only when I reach the age where I could simply power through it without flinching that she didn't try physical things anymore. She was my mom and I didn't want to hurt her physically. She knew that and so just kept resorting to making me feel like shit all the time, then gaslighting me into thinking it was all in my head.\n\nI don't think I can express how depressed it made me and how often I thought everyone would be better off if I just wasn't around. I wasn't strong, I wasn't smart and I just felt like I really was just something every tolerated.\n\nFast forward a bit, High school is ending, I feel like crap and I have no idea what I want to do with my life...then an Army recruiter talks to me a bit and the rest is history. I go to basic training, I get stronger, meet a lot of guys that help me build my self esteem and made a solid bit of money for it all. I was in a great headspace and was able to look back to realize I felt like I did because of my mom.\n\nOnce I got back home, I was introduced to a career in construction, which I took. It was nothing special, just $19 an hour, but it let me make Money comfortably and pick up skills for my future. My mom didn't like that. And kept starting arguments over the stupidest things that always led back to \"So just because you're making a little money, you think you're better than me then?\". At this point, I'd seen a lot of stuff overseas that I preferably didn't want to make anyone else worry by talking about it. But lets just say that I still freak out at night when the 4th of July comes around and i\u2019m not quite \u201cAlright\u201d sometimes.\n\nThis is where my mental break happens. She's shouting, cursing, banging on my door, picks the lock, then gets in my face to shout some more. All the things over the years start to build up and I want more than **anything** to punch her just to make it stop. But instead I break down and bang my first against the wall screaming \"I want so fucking little! But you keep pushing me! Because you think you can do whatever you want to me!\". She is **still** shouting about something, while I'm breaking down in legitimate tears with restraint. It really bothered me to that I **knew** I could make it all go away just by turning around and swinging my fist. But I didn't and it wasn't easy for me not to cross that line. Eventually she tells me I can just \"Pack all my shit and get the fuck out\".\n\nSo I finally just say \"Fine then! I will then!\". Now, I didn't immediately pack all my stuff, but in a matter of 3 days, I'd found my first apartment on my own and pack all my things and left. Leaving with only a brief conversation letting my mom know that she's hurt me for years now, which I don't think she even bothered to remember.\n\nThat was about a year and a half ago. I'm not rich, but I'm living comfortably. I talk with my mom every now and again **solely** for the purpose of making sure my youngest sister is alright. Who always seems eager to come over to my place on the weekend. But sometimes, that almost feels like an excuse to allow my mom to stay in my life, rather than cut her out of it.\n\nAnd a few days ago, my mom calls and says something along the lines of \"What's up with you? Why don't you call or come by anymore\". I hung up and I haven't been able to calm down or forget that questioning since. It made me realize that even after this long I'm **still** that sad, angry guy that I was before.\n\nI know this anger I feel isn't healthy, but I don't know what to do. I still have hate for my mom for the years of nearly pushing me to end myself and the gaslighting, but a part of me keeps saying \"There was good times too, or did you forget those? She could have abandoned you or did drugs like everyone else. Are you really going to cut her off because of issues she picked up trying to raise three kids alone?\"\n\nBut I don't know. I guess it does actually feel good to type all this out, even if no one but me reads all of it. I'm hoping I figure out the right choice, if not for myself, then at least for my little sister. She's basically a mini copy of me and I know she's going through much the same as I did at her age with my mom. So maybe it would be better if I forced myself through things to be a friendly face for her.\n\nIf anyone did read this far. Thanks.

She wasn\u2019t able to sleep at all on the plane and was exhausted. She left her car at my mom\u2019s house while she was out of town. We live about 3 hours away from my mom so my daughter asked her grandmother (my mom) if she could sleep for a few hours before she made the long drive back home. My mom has plenty of room - 2 extra bedrooms. She allowed her to sleep for an hour and then woke her up and told her she had to leave because her cleaning person was coming and she needed to be out of the way. So she sent my exhausted daughter out the door and told her to get a Diet Coke if she was tired. This is not a new pattern with her.

I was happy with that after years of trying to create a relationship of mother daughter and it not happening to then being at peace with not really having a mother at all. After grieving the loss and realisation that the relationship never existed I could cope with it much better. \nI didn\u2019t realise she was narcissistic until recently actually but now it all slots into place. \nI told her I was pregnant and she majorly swooped in on my vulnerabilities. As this is my first child it\u2019s all new to me and I didn\u2019t want to deprive her of being a grandparent so I openly let her in. \nShe absolutely swamped me with visits, the most expensive gift on our register and major boundary stomping. I was politely trying to tell her no to everything as she wasn\u2019t someone I had a relationship with before the pregnancy (I didn\u2019t say the last part but I should have!). \nThis is such a long story but basically she has been competing with anyone else she can to get the most visits with baby. Taken the baby off my whilst sleeping. Posted photos online without consent. All the usual crazy stuff I see people talking about on here lol.\nI realised during a therapy session that I was just waiting for her to do something wrong so I callus say goodbye for good but also that she\u2019d been doing things that were wrong repeatedly! \nI am mad at myself for ever letting her be a part of my life and certainly don\u2019t want such a toxic person near my child. \nThe latest boundary cross was posting a photo online without consent bragging about her gorgeous grand baby blah blah blah and when confronted (all relatives were told not to post) she said she had permission. Big sigh. Nope. So I finally stood up for myself, asked for it to be removed, etc. and it was. Great! \nFrom that point I wanted to hear nothing. Ever. I got a message with more reasoning, blaming me for the post, etc, then the silent treatment for a while. I enjoyed that. \nBut then I got a call (which I didn\u2019t pick up) and a text as if nothing has happening asking for a catch-up. \nHow do I get rid? I am so done.

My family is caught in a really bad cycle of mutual abuse, yelling, name calling, and crying. I (35f) and my husband (30m) are having a really hard time adjusting to living with my mom (63f). We live in a very expensive town, so after my father passed last June very unexpectedly (lifelong veteran with untreated ptsd and wrecked his motorcycle after an alcohol relapse) I told her she should come move to our town. She used the life insurance to buy a home that my husband and I share with her and we moved out of our rented space. We pay very low \u201crent\u201d and 100% of the utilities, but really it is just contributing to the home (the home is in my name and my mothers name). I was very much on board for her moving in. We lived together in her home for several month after my dads passing and things went well. \n\nUnfortunately, the dynamic has shifted to a place where we are all miserable. We continue to trigger each other and everyone is unhappy. I have come to terms with this situation is not working, but rentals have quadrupled in our area and we simply don\u2019t have the means to move out. I\u2019m very stupid for putting myself and my husband in this situation, and we are actively saving to move, but it will take us a few months to save money. I know the ultimate answer that will make us a better family is more space, but I need to make it work for now as I have NO other place for myself, my husband, and my 3 cats. \n\nThis is a small example of our interactions:\nHusband is upset that mom is incredibly demanding of us. A vast majority of our weekends and week nights are spent on improving the home and we are extremely tired. We have been working towards a happy medium and I can truly say none of us are lazy, but mom demands things get done on the list as soon as humanly possible. These are big projects, like building fencing, laying a patio, and building a shed. We are always working towards that goal, but when mom feels it isn\u2019t being done fast enough, she is resentful. For reference, in the last 5 months, we have already completed building the fence, changed a ton of landscaping, built a catio, built 90% of the patio, and have done numerous small tasks inside the home all while maintaining full time work and keeping up with all household tasks. \n\nTwo night ago, my husband had a mental break. The amount of work and the constant fighting have become overwhelming. I feel extreme guilt that I have trapped us in this situation. \n\nSince moving in, my mom and I have fallen into a pattern that has been present since my childhood. When we fight, I cry. I\u2019m on antidepressants and anxiety meds, but I cannot stop crying. The fights are never 100% her fault, but she often calls me a cry baby, tells me I\u2019m acting stupid or entitled and ungrateful, and threatens to throw me out. Last night, after my husband left, she called us both babies and it just triggers my crying. She then screams at me because I am crying and feels I am trying to manipulate her. I tell her it hurts me when she calls me names and she doubles down with the general sentiment that her feelings are hurt and she doesn\u2019t cry all the time. She then fake cries to mock me or laugh at me. \n\nI feel like a child. I have had so many years of therapy because I was a bad child. I\u2019ve worked so hard to grow up and make my mental health my responsibility. It is unfair to her that I cannot stop crying and I can\u2019t regulate my emotions. How can I better disengage and get control of myself? If things don\u2019t change, I\u2019m going to lose my husband and my mom. I have no other family (mom has been no contact with them for years). I don\u2019t really know what advice I\u2019m expecting, but if anyone has gone through something similar i am all ears.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678467301.0},{"title":"Healing is important.

Anyway, I moved out and was a lot happier being free of that stress and only visiting my parents and siblings on my terms. It was nice until early February when I went to the ER because of a really bad fainting spell and panic attack that followed that made me nonverbal for about 45 minutes. Luckily my boyfriend (19 m) was there to help me, because we found out at the hospital that my family was up North camping. They were upset and claimed to be worried, and I was too, I didn't drive for a week and had to quit my job after further doctor appointments claimed it was slowly destroying my lungs and quite possibly brain.

I got things situated about a little over a week ago and went to talk about moving back in, and before I could say anything, my dad had a two hour long talk with me about how he wanted my boyfriend to move into the house so they could help him. It caught me off guard, but it wasn't unreasonable considering he was in a very horrible toxic situation with his family, I was just shocked because I was already offered a room back.\n\nI brought up that I was planning on coming back for my health but my dad said he and my mom discussed that they felt I was fine because I was getting medical treatment. I tried to explain that I needed support right now, especially since my mom talked about paying for my dog training certification so I could help train a service dog (that was medically recommended to me at this point), all he said was that my boyfriend needed them more.

I was very close to going no contact with her only recently and started talking to her again as I though I'd give her a chance, but I'm not really convinced that was a good idea. She's quite bearable when he's not around, but then he acts in an abusive way and according to her it's my fault every time, she's always been protective towards all abusers in my life and invalidating towards me, I think what she said today severed the fragile relationship with her since nearly going no contact and I'm really not certain if it's worth keeping any sort of relationship with her if she keeps protecting him.\n\nCould you help identify what kind of manipulation tactic she was using against me when she said what I described above and how would you respond? I only told her I'm not angry and I don't like when she likens me to my father. For some reason, I felt pressured to say I wasn't angry, because then she would use that as her evidence against me to make it look like it's all because of me.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678470035.0},{"title":"Has your parent\/parents ever accused you of thinking you\u2019re gifted even though you said nothing that would indicate that you think this?","author":"4TT4CKH3LICOPTR","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ns0kx\/has_your_parentparents_ever_accused_you_of\/","text":"Here are a list of reasons on why my mom accused me of thinking that I\u2019m smarter than other people:\n\nI corrected her English grammar (I\u2019m a native English speaker and she\u2019s not)\n\nI told her that she doesn\u2019t know more about vaccines than the scientists who makes them\n\nI explain to her the very basics of evolution, which she couldn\u2019t comprehend\n\nI told her that she misunderstood something she read in English (again, she\u2019s not a native English speaker, while I am)\n\nI said that I\u2019m not intellectually disabled (I had to say this because she frequently said that I was)\n\nI said that I didn\u2019t have deficits in reading comprehension (I had to say this because she tried to insist that I did)\n\nI said that I didn\u2019t have deficits with my penmanship (I had to say this because she tried to insist that I had a handwriting disability)\n\nMy IQ test results concluded that I have average intelligence\n\nI\u2019m an atheist\n\nI\u2019m not antivax\n\nI questioned the validity of information about vaccines that she showed me which were from Facebook, sketchy news sites and outdated sources.\n\nI told her that she\u2019s not smarter than other people","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678461845.0},{"title":"He threw away all of our food last night","author":"FewHotel8587","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11npocl\/he_threw_away_all_of_our_food_last_night\/","text":"Only because he has nothing to do except hurt us emotionally.

My initial thought was, um, how does this make her a narc? Then while I was reading through the comments, people were talking about how it's totally how her mom wants her to beg her to come and wants to feel wanted so bad. Then to find OP confirmed this is normal behavior and why she's a narc. \n\nI have very bold narc parents. The gaslighting type, you know the drill. \n\nBut now I have to wonder if my JNMIL is also displaying narc behavior by doing the same thing... I've always suspected my in laws of being narcs too but never for this insecurity type behavior.\n\nMy MIL had me thinking she's really self conscious, insecure, and just makes shit up in her head. But maybe I'm wrong. I often say to my husband how she \"wants to be invited with a golden invite mailed to her\" because they constantly gripe about how they don't come by *insert all sorts of stupid excuses*. I often think, how can someone be so gd afraid to ask their old kid that they want to come visit or whatever. My husband always treats his parents respectfully and we never say no. We always say they can come by whenever, etc. \n\nOne thanksgiving, my MIL made plans with my husband to come for the holiday and stay overnight (we just had a baby too). Then literally the morning they were supposed to be driving here, she messaged me through Snapchat asking if I was sure she should come. How she didn't want to burden me, yada yada. I was super pissed because I had nothing to do with the communication about them coming. My husband handled it and obviously I was on board. I never even answered her because I thought it was bogus, esp for her to try to make me the bad guy or something. \n\nI can't tell if this kind of behavior is some kind of social anxiety or if this is some kind of narc behavior wanting us to \"want her around so bad\"? We are just not the type of people to invite anyone over, but welcome anyone who wants to come, and we certainly don't provide whatever kind of praise she seems to be looking for because both our parents are emotionally immature so we struggle with that as well. \n\nJust curious what people's thoughts are, id never ever thought of this as some kind of narc behavior especially with my own very different type of narc parents.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678465901.0},{"title":"A show and tell of what it's like being raised by a narcissist.","author":"Amaxe1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11n6f15\/a_show_and_tell_of_what_its_like_being_raised_by\/","text":"A recounting of some of my memories\n\nAges, events, and spoken words are best estimates.\n\n\nI was eight.\n\n\nMy mom and I leave the church event, standing in the hallway near the exit doors. I can hear the chatter from people still inside the sacrament room down the hallway and through the walls.\n\n\nMy mom exudes the loud silence I have become intimately familiar with. I know she has something to say and that she isn't happy.\n\n\n\"That isn't normal,\" she murmers, voice etched with disappointment and anxiety, leaning close like we're sharing a terrible secret, \"You didn't see the look on their faces when you did that.\"\n\n\nThat was the first time she said it like that. But it wasn't the last.\u00a0\n\n\nI wonder how I'm supposed to behave outside when her and our home life are all I know.\n\n\nI was nine.\n\n\nI stand in the doorway of what will be my new classroom. It's a mobile trailer in the furthest corner of school campus. The lights are out and the five or so students that occupy it are lying on the ground.\n\n\n\"It's quiet time.\" The teacher tells my mom. Apparently they do this for ten minutes every day. Students lay on the carpet and don't move or do anything at all. This is a class specialized for violent children after all. It helps them be calm.\n\n\nI'm still there two years later, even though the teachers told my mom I didn't belong in there. I wasn't violent like those kids.\u00a0\n\n\nI watched a kid scream and thrash on the ground and rip up and fling toilet paper around the classroom. I was chased by a kid who hogged the playset and tried to force me to kiss him.\n\n\n'This is what people see in me?' I think to myself. 'This is what's wrong with me?'\u00a0\n\n\nNo one told me any different.\n\n\nI was thirteen.\n\n\nI sit at the kitchen table, arms crossed protectively over my chest. My heart races. No matter how straight I try to sit, I feel like I'm hunched over.\n\n\nPills sit innocently on the table in front of me. I don't know what they are called, and I don't know what they are for. All I had been told is that they are supposed to fix my behavior. Whatever that meant.\n\n\nMy mom sits at my side, eyes studying my face. It's natural, at this point, to not show my fear.\u00a0\n\n\nIf only I could convince myself I'm not afraid.\n\n\n\"If you don't take them, I will force you to.\" Her voice is cold. A strung wire ready to snap.\n\n\nMy imagination goes wild. I imagine her shoving them up my butt. She's a nurse. She would know how to make me take them. She always follows through with these kinds of threats. And she's angry enough to pin me down if I cross her further.\n\n\nI don't know what these pills are going to do to me. I don't know how much of me will still be here when it's done. But I don't have a choice. Not really.\n\n\nMy hand shakes as I reach for them. Through fury or fear, I can't tell.\n\n\nI was twelve.\n\n\nShe said it was only for 24 hours. They already tried the brain monitor in the hospital and there weren't any results. But my mom knows that there's something wrong with my head. Something wrong with me. She's always known.\n\n\nShe thinks I have absence seizures. Apparently I was staring off into space for too long during one of the meals at girls camp.\n\n\nNow there's a monitor on my head. A tangled mess of wires and white medical wrap. I look like an alien with a bulbous head. All I feel is shame. It's as though the whole world can see that I'm crazy now. The scarf wrapped on top of that only makes me feel slightly better. I'm just glad no one at school is going to see me like this.\n\n\nI was thirteen.\n\n\nShe told me I have Asperger's syndrome. She got me a book to read and a movie to watch. To understand my disability, she said.\n\n\nThe book explained how people with Asperger's misunderstand people.\n\n\nI sit on the couch, book in hand. Trying to understand how this is me. A child in the book is told by his teacher to take a seat. The child, confused, grabs his seat and lifts it up. He took his seat, just as his teacher told him to.\u00a0\n\n\nThe book shows a single sentence and how emphasizing a different word in the sentence can completely change the meaning. I think it's interesting, but I don't misunderstand the way the book tells me I should.\n\n\nI don't find any of this relatable. I'm only confused. I don't misunderstand people, not like that. But my mom knows better than I do. I need to stop questioning her, she only has my best interests in mind after all.\n\n\nI just wish I had advice. Someone telling me how I'm supposed to be better, instead of pointing at everything I'm doing wrong.\n\n\nI was thirteen.\n\n\nI have been to multiple therapists who specialize in disabled children. I don't remember a single thing that was said in any of our interactions. But there was one therapist that I liked and I felt comfortable with.\u00a0\n\n\nI like how open and colorful his office is. I like how he doesn't talk down to me. He's an artist, and draws silly caricatures that represent various emotions.\n\n\nApparently he also has Asperger's. I haven't seen him in a while though. Too long.\n\n\nIt's late. I wander to my parents bedroom doorway, knock, and ask into the dark when I will see him again.\n\n\n\"You aren't seeing him anymore.\" Mom replies. I can just make out her outline as she shifts in bed.\n\n\n\"What? Why not?\"\n\n\n\"He\u2026 he kicked me out. He wouldn't listen to me. You won't be going back there... The disrespect\u2026\"\n\n\nI can remember what she's talking about.\u00a0\n\n\nMom had been telling him something about me. I wasn't listening. I'm used to shutting down when she gets like this. When she has lots to say but none of it makes sense.\n\n\nHe asked her to leave. I continued to stare at the floor, but I could feel the tension in the air. She left, and I finished my session with him. I don't remember any of it, but I had no idea that this would be the last time I saw him.\n\n\nI was fourteen.\n\n\nI'm in high school.\u00a0\n\n\nMy heart feels hollow and my tongue sluggish and heavy every time I try to speak. People will know I'm crazy; That I'm embarrassing the moment I open my mouth.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I know that I can't get better unless I practice. I'm determined, with a fire that by all rights I shouldn't possess.\n\n\nI turn to the girl next to me in my first English class of the year. I try to start a conversation.\u00a0\n\n\nIt doesn't go well.\u00a0\n\n\nThat doesn't stop me from trying again.\n\n\nI was sixteen\n\n\n\"We've only had this happen once before,\" the school counselor warns, \"From then on, it was a struggle for him to graduate. There won't be any coming back from this. You have to be certain.\"\n\nI am certain. I was certain the moment I learned about it. Finding out that many of my grades had been manually brought up over the years because of my parent proclaimed 'mild autism' was a blow to the gut. \n\nAll these years, teachers giving me specialized easier tests, and those tests being in specialized rooms, with staff ready to read them aloud if I wanted. I always hated it. I always talked about how much I despised being singled out like that.\n\nAnd then to find out that I didn't always even earn the grades I'd been given? I refuse to let it continue. How can I say I graduated when all I really know I accomplished was getting older?\n\n\"I'm sure,\" I say, voice steady for once.\n\nMy mom nods at my side. I don't understand why she's letting me do this. It's out of character for her. But I'll take advantage of it while I can.\n\nDespite the odds, my grades improve. Perhaps because I have something to prove. Something I can control.\n\n\nI was eighteen.\n\n\nI gained two jobs and lost those two jobs within two months. The first I lost because of my availability, the second because of my anxiety. I couldn't make a business call without stuttering over my words. My anxiety has gotten better since the high school years, but it's still a challenge.\n\n\nShe won't let me forget about being fired, bringing it up often. It's my fault, she says, it can't be a coincidence since it happened with two jobs.\n\n\nI lay in bed, feeling hopeless. I was a failure, just like mom always knew I would be. Months, a year, passes like this. Unproductive and seeking online distractions. TV shows, movies, books. Anything that takes my mind away.\n\n\n\"You should see an occupational therapist.\" She tells me one day.\n\n\nI don't know what makes an occupational therapist different from a normal therapist, but my hackles rise. If it's anything like therapy, I want nothing to do with it. I refuse, vehemently.\u00a0\n\n\nTherapy means that I'm the problem. I've figured that out by now.\n\n\nNo matter what she says, I know I didn't do anything wrong. It's not my fault I'm too nervous, and it's not my fault that I don't have full availability when working two jobs.\n\n\nIt's not my fault, even if I'm the only one who believes that.\n\n\nI was nineteen.\n\n\nI could hardly believe it. I'm going to BYUI. I can go there. The college for people who love the outdoors. It feels strange, freeing, being able to make a choice like that. I'm not used to being able to make choices for myself. Certainly not big ones like this. I like it. A lot.\n\n\nIf this is what it means to be an adult, I never want to go back. I sit at mom's desk on her computer trying to sort out how it all works. I'm used to figuring things out on my own. I'm confident that I can do this.\u00a0But there's still something that needs to be done that has been put off for too long.\n\n\nI approach my mom, asking why she still hasn't signed the FAFSA.\n\n\nShe brushes me off, but I press her for answers. She paces, and I refuse to leave. Eventually she snaps.\n\n\n\"Because you're going to crash and burn and I'm going to be stuck with your debt!\u201d\n\n\nI feel my stomach drop. The whole room feels stifling. I still in place, eyes wide and mouth hanging. Choking on air. \"I\u2026 I can't\u2026 I can't believe you would say that.\" My voice is hoarse, as though I'd been screaming.\n\n\nWe stand there for a long moment. Just staring at each other.\n\n\n\"Why would you say that?!\"\n\n\nMom's face twists in a complicated pile of emotions. It's as though she knows she crossed a line. But she doesn't take it back. She doesn't say anything. She never apologises anyway.\n\n\nIt's another two years before I'm deemed responsible enough to go to college.\n\n\nI was nineteen.\n\n\n\"You should smile more.\"\n\n\nMy brows furrow. \"What?\"\n\n\nMom looks at me as she pulls the car into the grocery store parking lot. \"You don't smile very much, you need to work on smiling more.\"\n\n\nI stare straight ahead, my face neutral. It often is nowadays. \"What should I smile about?\"\n\n\nMom shakes her head in exasperation. \"Look at the trees, the sky! The world is beautiful. That's something to smile about.\"\n\n\nI look at the trees planted sparsely throughout the parking lot. They're small things with tiny leaves, supported with wooden stakes to protect them from the high winds.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't see what I'm supposed to be seeing.\u00a0\n\n\nThey're just trees.\n\n\nI don't have anything to say that she'll want to hear. So I don't say anything at all.\n\n\nI was twenty.\n\n\nI tell my mom that I decided that when I die, I want my body cremated and my ashes buried under a cherry tree.\n\n\nShe laughs at me. \"Cherry trees don't grow in Arizona,\" she says.\n\n\n\"Well, maybe not a cherry tree, but\u2026 they sure are beautiful. I want it to be something that has fruit and a lot of flowers.\"\n\n\nThe car is silent.\n\n\nA thought strikes me, and I feel like a bucket of ice water dropped on top of me.\n\n\n\"If I died before you, you would just put me in a white dress in a casket with a standard Mormon funeral, knowing I don't want that, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\nHer lips purse. She doesn't answer.\n\n\nI was twenty-four.\n\n\nIt's my birthday. I didn't want to be here, but I still have a bit of guilt and family loyalty. I flew down from college to spend a week with my family. A week which encompasses both Christmas and my birthday.\n\n\nMy mom lasted two or three days before she got into a one-sided hour and a half tangent with me about how much I have disappointed her. I had long stopped listening about 5 or 10 minutes in.\n\n\n\"Maybe you should just go back to Idaho,\" she finishes saying as she leaves. It's too late, I later confirmed on the phone. I can't change my flights so close to the deadline. And I can't afford another ticket. I'm just a college student and my mom isn't going to be giving me any handouts. She hasn't in years.\n\n\nChristmas is a modest and somewhat tense affair.\n\n\nFor my birthday, I'm taken to a restaurant I didn't want to go to. I know better than to complain, so I just stay silent as I'm taken where they want to go. After everyone is in bed but my parents and I, I'm given one gift. The only gift of the day, so I know it has to be special.\n\n\nMy mom and stepdad sit silently to my left and watch me closely. The lights are off but the fireplace is lit. I unwrap it to find that it is a book. I tilt it forward so that the fire lights the front enough for me to read its cover.\n\n\nPutting on the Armor of God\n\nHow to win your battles with Satan\n\n\nI'm floored. It isn't even subtle anymore. They're insane. I'm a good mormon, I volunteer, I attend church, and I contribute to my community.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not a sinner, but because I no longer respect or revere them, I need a self-help book on how to win my apparent battles with satan.\n\n\nAnger at the Injustice of it all rises in my gut. How dare they. Just what pedestal have they put themselves on to feel that this is okay?\n\n\nIt's not okay. We aren't okay. We will never be and were never okay.\n\n\nMy face remains blank as I continue to stare at the book. I can feel their eyes on my side. Always watching, always studying. They can't read me anymore. They haven't been able to since I was a small child. Not when it matters. They made me this way.\u00a0\n\n\nI say a simple \"Thank you,\" voice monotone and features flat. They aren't going to be getting anything out of me tonight. But something dies in me at that moment.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I make it back home, states away, I buy myself my favorite cake and light it with as many candles as the years I have lived, the way I always wanted it to be but never had. Not in recent memory. It may not be my birthday anymore, but today is my day.\u00a0\n\nTL;DR\n\nNarcissists only care about themselves.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678401819.0},{"title":"am i wrong for doing this","author":"sjsok","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ntqxd\/am_i_wrong_for_doing_this\/","text":"ever since i was born i have been surrounded of fighting like badwords and stuff. and so sometimes getting physical like my dad punching my mom and my mom doing middle fingers stuff. basically any child that shouldnt be hearing and seeing.

I\u2019ve also recently had a baby. I\u2019ve been very clear that I\u2019d be open to my dad meeting the baby and being in their life, but I have to be there and it has to be in my house or a neutral space; I refuse to go to their house and be screamed at for how useless\/selfish etc I am. I\u2019ve also stated he needs to put in effort rather than expecting everyone to cater to him, as usual. He has refused to do so because I\u2019m setting too many terms and trying to change his behaviour too much. I guess his ego trumps his desire to meet his grandchild, which really makes me feel sorry for him. \n\nIt\u2019s such a tricky one, isn\u2019t it.

Misgendering and overall insensitiveness aside, she mocked and joked about it while knowing how important my laptop is to me.\n\nFor years, it's been my only gateway through which I could contact online friends, whom she's incredibly against having and demonizes all people from the internet (therefore she doesn't know about them), run away from harsh and lonely reality, a safe space that saved me from suicidal thoughts and actually following through them countless of times. Being away from it for prolonged periods of time or not being able to use it (mostly due to my mother who hates it whenever I use any device unless it's for studying or when it benefits her) causes me to be uneasy and very irritable (combined with my bad impulse & emotion control, it can result in meltdowns or shutdowns easily).\n\nThe closer I get to my 18th bday, the more controlling she wants to be and gets furious when I don't inform her about every single tiny plan I have in mind (as well as the cost of it, who'd be involved and when, all details etc.). She despises my psychologist (for whom I had to beg for years to get) and it all comes back to money and status quo (due to my neurodiversity and queerness, I clash badly with what society requires from me and forces me to be).\n\nNow coming back to the part where I didn't go to school because of my mental state.\nI didn't mention this to my mother because I knew she'd be pissed off (she highly dislikes me being late and not being at school no matter the reason).\n\nYet she noticed my absence due to her checking my location (she knows it at all times due to me being forced to have it on) and getting a notification about my today's absence at school and started calling me constantly. I was showering so I couldn't pick it up right away, but called her back right away (to not be even more in trouble) and that's when it all went down again.\n\nShe went from screaming at me, being furious I didn't tell her right away (I hoped it'd go away and I'd just be regular late or 1 lesson late but that's all) and not understanding why I didn't tell her right away that. Then she went after the monetary aspects (she always has to mention or reference or even entirely focus on it) and said something that pushed me to the verge of a panic attack:\n\"After you're 18 and done with high school  we'll close [name of the street I live on] (she meant locking the flat I live in) and lock you in [the town she lives in, not far from where I live], make you live with us\"\n\nIt's a terrifying thought, living with her again.\nI got a 2 month \"demo\" version of such a life during summer 2021, when I got de facto manipulated into spending the entire summer break with her at her husband's house (I was first told it'd be just 2 weeks, then during the renovation of the flat I'd be able to stay at my grandpa's place with absolutely no issue. Ended up spending 2 whole months on the very verge of breaking since day 1 and almost 2 suicide attempts throughout).\n\nA few minutes after the mention, she went after my psychologist, claiming she made me weak and frivolous (\"turned me into an anarchist\"), then dragged my identity through the mud with constant reminders of how I was, am and will be seen as a woman no matter what I wear and how I want to be called. She\/her and feminine versions of words were constantly directed at me (english is my second language, first one is very gendered) and it made me tear up and cry almost instantaneously (due to her, I had to learn how to cry soundlessly so that \"came in handy\" this time).\n\nThen suddenly cooled down and started complaining about how annoying it is for me to get an upset stomach and feel bad so easily and miss school at all due to it.\n\nThe call lasted over 50 minutes and I feel exhausted mentally again. \nAs a form of gaslighting and damage control, she's spamming me with the \"I just really care about you\" and \"let's talk\" kind of messages, that I'm trying my best to not let them get into me (as they distort my view of words said out of actual care and love).\n\nI just really needed to get this off my chest, I cannot wait to become independent and go no contact the moment it happens.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678453622.0},{"title":"Free","author":"mentalsea5001","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11nd734\/free\/","text":"Dad just admitted to me that my sister's behavior was creepy and wrong over recording.

For background, I (26F) have been my mom's caretaker since I was 12. My dad is somewhat present but he has a hard time maintaining patience with my mom, and I have an older sister who is just starting to also help out in my mom's care. My mom has been disabled since I was 5 years old due to post-polio syndrome, among other things. I became her caretaker for the days she couldn't take care of herself and also her outlet for her thoughts and feelings, and I was doing housework for her. For further background info, I was a very premature baby and was near death several times during infancy, so everyone likes to tell me I'm special and a \"miracle baby\" (which I hate). She has always been known to be \"feisty\", and our childhood wasn't the best. Her favorite thing to do is victim-blame and say we're all too sensitive. Our lives have always circled around her, her illnesses, and what's best for her. Anyway, three years ago my mom began dialysis and I trained with her to do peritoneal dialysis but it didn't work out for her. This year, I was unwillingly roped into doing training for home hemodialysis (HHD), which she could do alone but she wanted my help with and I knew she would be happiest at home. \n\nBefore we started HHD I had moved out four months prior with my now-husband. We had been together for 8 years and I always put off moving in together because my mom wouldn't have liked it. Of course, she didn't, and told me I was making the biggest mistake of my life and refused to speak to me for a week when I moved out. Although I moved out, I still came over to see her at least four days a week and I would take her shopping or to doctor's appointments. Lately, she's been on a new antidepressant that has made her overly aggressive, delusional, and just over-all more abusive (gaslighting, verbal abuse, acting out). I spoke with her several times about her behavior and urged her to talk to her psychiatrist, but she refused. To top it off, she was self-medicating with insane amounts of THC to take the \"edge off\". I gave her an ultimatum: speak with her psychiatrist and stop self-medicating or I'll speak with her dialysis clinic to get some respite care for about two weeks. I got a call from her dialysis nurse yesterday morning asking me if I'm refusing to do her treatment any further and that she called him crying saying I've left her in the dust. I explained the situation and he was able to find respite care at a clinic nearby. I told her the schedule and she flew off the handle, screaming that I've betrayed her because I'm messing up her doctor's appointments and daily schedule (I made sure the schedule wouldn't interfere with anything). I explained to her that she can discuss options with her nurse, seeing as the respite care order has already been placed, and we could all work together to figure something out. Obviously, she didn't like that idea one bit because she has \"cooperated enough, no one wants to help me\". Wow, wonder why.\n\nThis morning she calls me to tell me that I'm selfish and I've left her out to dry. In her words, \"I thought you were special and different from your dad and sister, but you're just like them\". I let her know that all I want is some cooperation and a break, but instead she tells me she's done with me and wants nothing to do with me because I've ruined everything for her, and she hung up. I had also trained my sister, who lives with her, in HHD so I let her know that I'm done taking care of our mom and I'll be available if she needs any help during my mom's treatment. I just can't help but feel guilty, but I've been her emotional dumping grounds and spent years being told I'm selfish, useless, and stupid for the last 14 years. I've sacrificed so much to keep her happy, seeing as I'm the only one who could truly stand her personality and attitude. On top of it all, I have my own chronic illnesses to manage and I'm in my last 9 months of nursing school with a 3.5 GPA! But, I'm exhausted and overwhelmed.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678389659.0},{"title":"Mom calls me ungrateful and I don't know what to do anymore","author":"Soggy_End_1515","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11ndg70\/mom_calls_me_ungrateful_and_i_dont_know_what_to\/","text":"This is extremely embarrassing for me to write, but I am (almost) a 28 year old woman, with no clear idea of what I want to do with my life. I have never been financially independent. I pay for my rent, while my mom still pays for my car insurance, health insurance, and phone bill.\n\nBasically, my NMom was a huge stage mom and completely emotionally unavailable my entire life, with tons of rage. A true Jekyll and Hyde, she was extremely abusive, often threatening to kill me, giving me the silent treatment, etc. She was *obsessed* with my childhood dream of being an actor: constantly comparing me to my peers, obsessing over private lessons, and treating me like a stage pony by telling me how much more special I was compared to everyone else. And in her eyes, if I had my education paid for, that meant I had a perfect life and had nothing to be upset about. I went to high school on a theatre scholarship, I studied acting in college, and went to one of the best acting programs in the country where I graduated with my MFA at 24 years old, in 2020. While in grad school, I grew extremely resentful - I felt I had so many other skills that I have never gotten to explore because I've been so boxed in my entire life by one thing: acting. What was once my dream became the only thing my mom praised me for. I actually got into filmmaking while in grad school, and felt happier and more connected to myself, than I have in years. I would come home from school and say I want to try directing, and she'd immediately shut it down. \n\nThe kicker here is that my education was completely paid for, in full, by her clients that she works for. It was always her dream to go to grad school, and she completely resents that I went. I will sometimes make comments that maybe I would be better off if they hadn't paid, because I would know myself better. I went to grad school so young, and was completely enabled, and never had to learn true independence. I feel that now I pay the price for it, with no direction in life or responsibility as an adult. When it became time to go off my mom's health insurance, she kept threatening that I would never be able to afford it on my own. The mere concept of health insurance now gives me copious amounts of anxiety. I just feel as if I haven't been set up for success. Meanwhile, my mom is not talking to me because she constantly tells me how ungrateful I am. She says she has to work to pay back her clients for paying for my schooling. I don't want to be ungrateful, but I feel extremely resentful and embarrassed that I don't know how to be a normal adult and survive on my own.

Usually, I can ignore such things and just go to my room and camp out until they return to normal, but that day I was in a very bad mental place and ended up blowing up at them and saying some very harsh things. This is not the first time this has happened and everything usually blows over within a week at the most. The only difference this time was that I was scared that they would do the normal things they do to torment me when they're mad at me, so I went and stayed at a friend's house for the night and a few days after. When I came home nothing was out of the ordinary except for the fact that Nparent was completely ignoring me. I didn't think much of it because I was also avoiding\/not talking to them in order to fly under the radar until it was safe to speak with them again without being yelled at.   \nThe problem is, now it has been a little over a month and they are still completely ignoring me. They are treating everyone else in the family normally, but they refuse to speak to\/about me, interact with me, or even make eye contact with me. I can say or do anything and they will just act as though I'm not in the room. They even buy dinner for everyone in the family except me. When prompted by my non-Nparent to stop being so childish and to stop ignoring me they blew up screaming at them to \"shut the f- up\" and that has been the only time they have acknowledged my existence.   \nI am very conflicted about this whole thing. Against my better judgment knowing that they are an abusive narcist, I find myself thinking that I had gone too far and that I am in the wrong for saying such harsh stuff to them when they got mad at me. That I deserve to be ignored and that it's my fault. I also find myself craving interaction with them, especially seeing them having fun with everyone else while I'm in the same room being ignored.   \nThe other part of me has never been happier that they're ignoring me because they are no longer treating me like their slave having me do them favor after favor, and I'm not having to deal with the emotional drainage that comes from interacting with them.   \nOverall, I feel ashamed that I crave this affection from my abuser, and a large part of me is very afraid that this all may never end. They have never ignored me or anyone else in my family for this long and I have to keep resisting the urge to reach out to them first. A few times I've tried saying something casual to them or asking them a question like what they want from the store, but none of that works and I'm scared of trying too much. I'm not sure if trying to interact with them first and kissing their ass would make it stop or just make things worse. I'm so scared of how long I may have to wait this out and that fear is embarrassing as I feel like it shouldn't be this big of a deal to me. It feels so childish to be broken down by such a juvenile tactic, you know? Especially since I am dependent on them for certain important necessities, I'm just scared that I might make the situation worse by trying to rush back into their good graces.   \n\n\nIf anyone else has experienced this and can offer advice or words of encouragement it would be greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678420974.0},{"title":"Former nboss just raged at me, immediately terminated my employment, and told me that I would be leaving on \"bad terms\" all because I told him I accepted another offer and was leaving.","author":"ledeledeledeledele","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11n5x0j\/former_nboss_just_raged_at_me_immediately\/","text":"I (25M) have never had this reaction from any boss before. I always felt uneasy about this particular boss and walked on eggshells around him. I did everything I could to not provoke him and wrote and rewrote my resignation letter multiple times to make it seem as non-threatening as possible. He raged anyway. I was as polite and professional as possible when he *demanded* that I do a Zoom call with him (he didn't respond to my resignation message). It took me back to my childhood. I felt like a terrified 6-year-old being screamed at in my face by ndad again. I can't believe that he could get away with acting like that in a company. Then again, the CEO is a narcissist himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe job itself was shit. The company was a cult. They constantly had turnovers. We were underpaid, extremely overworked, and they watched us like hawks (for example, if I didn't respond to their messages *immediately*, then my former boss would have a Zoom call with me and essentially try to intimidate me). I couldn't sleep at night because I was constantly having to worry about tons of scenarios that my boss might be angry at me for, such as being 1 minute late to a meeting or something like that. I was rehearsing my lines just like I used to do with my shithole nparents. I realized all of this over the last few weeks, and today was when I finally got an offer for my new job. I want to say that I'm happy, but I am shaken up. That former (thank fucking god he's not my fucking boss anymore) boss caused an extreme trauma reaction and I'm shaken up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only saving grace about that job was that I had made a few friends there who felt the same way. I showed them my resignation letter and asked them what they thought, and they liked it. The fact that I wasn't alone in this situation helped me tremendously. I was also going to tell them how the call with our boss went, but my boss locked me out of my account *immediately.* I gave them my Instagram though so hopefully I'll be able to talk to them again, but holy fucking shit, this was fucking insane. I haven't been treated like this since I was in contact with ndad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you know what? Even though I'm shaken up, things are different. I'm fucking pissed at my boss. My anger is rising. There is no fucking way that I was in the wrong there. The only thing that I could potentially see a problem with was the fact that I wouldn't give him 2 weeks' notice. I claimed that it was because my new job was having me start on Monday, but I just made that up to so I could have an easier way to avoid his rage. Also, my boss quietly fired most of my former team without *any fucking notice.* Can you fucking believe that? People just got a fucking Zoom call in the middle of the day and were told that they were being fired. The only reason I knew this was because that same boss had a secret Zoom call with me and told me what was going on, and threatened me that if he heard about me talking to anyone else, then there would be \"consequences\". Fucking asshole. Of course the company has that \"at-will employer\" crap in their contract, as if having the legal ability to do that makes it right. He was happy to throw multiple employees' lives in disarray (many of us were living paycheck to paycheck with that shit salary), but got *furious* when he received the same treatment. So why should I give him a 2-weeks' notice? That job was fucking killing me and I was at my limit several months ago. I can imagine how ndad would have defended my boss and blamed me for this. Thank fucking god I am no contact and have empathetic people to talk to now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt also reminded me of the time when I told my ndad I was quitting his soccer team that he had forced me to play on. At 17-years-old, he was still forcing me to do it against my will and was forcing me to work at his business. I could feel his rage increasing when I said it. I'm proud of myself then and feel the same way now. It's not easy to confront a narcissist--especially when they're bigger than you and hit you (in ndad's case with me). Now, I am 6'0\" tall and bigger than my boss, so no physical threats there. It's funny--when I told him I was quitting, my former boss used the same types of threats and excuses to try to force me to stay.\n\n\"You know, I stuck my neck out a bit for you for this role.\" No you didn't, you fired everyone you didn't like without telling them.\n\n\"A *lot* of people want this role, I don't think it's a good idea for you to quit.\" You're fucking delusional.\n\n\"You are going to be leaving on bad terms with us if you leave now.\" Ok. No professionalism.\n\n\"I've gotta be honest, I'm very disappointed in you.\" You don't want to know what I think of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut hey, I get to sleep in tomorrow!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678400712.0},{"title":"Found out my Dad cheated twice..","author":"Julia_fishy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11nfgzr\/found_out_my_dad_cheated_twice\/","text":"Once on my mom his first wife(which I didn't know until today) and she divorced him because of it.

I could really use some outside perspective\/advice. I pretty recently have realized that my mother is a narcissist. It wasn't until I was around my now husband's family (who are very kind and loving towards literally everyone) that I realized that my mom is very emotionally manipulative. I actually confronted her about this and she told me the typical \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" and denied all wrongdoing. \n\nI ended up sending her a letter that basically said that I wanted to fix our relationship but there were certain things that needed to be fixed first. It wasn't an argumentative or aggressive letter, just a genuine commentary on how I felt our relationship could improve.

She has since acted like this never even happened. \n\nShe puts on the facade that she is my sweet, loving mother when in reality I know that she just wants control over my life.

When I moved in with my Nmom, I did not read them (except for some ebooks I had on my computer), because I was too busy with: getting settled, getting set up with various help programs, helping her with her tree chipping help program, and also working out what I can to do work from home.

ILs decided to book a two week trip during the month of our TBC wedding. Also, just found out my partner has a violently abusive childhood. Not sure if I can marry into another toxic family without setting boundaries.\n\nILs have started including me in their passive-aggressive communication styles, which I was blind to until now. My partner of 10 years is concerned about standing up them and it is all becoming triggering as I left my toxic family and Nmom at 17. I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this and marry into another 'toxic' family. I'm also worried about my future kids. I've raised all of these concerns with my fianc\u00e9.\n\nWhen we first announced our news privately - one of the first things my ILs said to me was that they're very sorry but I now have to wait 3-4 years before I can expect to get married (that's how long my partner's mom waited for). Thinking it was a joke, I responded jokingly by saying \"not if I have a say in it!\". I'm not sure they found it very funny.\n\nSince then they decided to gift us some money for the engagement, and told us we didn't have to have a wedding and they didn't care if we eloped (they felt we can better use it elsewhere). We were so grateful and told them we were thinking of tying the knot in November this year, and in our state (because I cannot travel far due to my health).\n\nThey questioned our choice, and told us that my fianc\u00e9's sister is going through a lot of financial hardship and can't even afford to fly to see a dying family member. Then told us their flights will have to come out of the money they gave us (before saying it was a joke). Out of nowhere they started questioning our choice of employment and said they had paid for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s education. The phone call ended with them suggesting we just have a small causal wedding dinner at a public restaurant (fianc\u00e9's sister had a full traditional wedding and was \"made to spend more\" than she wanted to by ILs). \n\nA few days after this call we received a message from the mom asking us which restaurant we wanted them to visit for lunch that week and that they \"could use a day out\". We've only been engaged for 2 months so we politely declined their offer to help.\n\nBut it did stressed me out so much I started looking at over 100 venues across both states. We even traveled in secret to see some of them. Then we remembered his sister's family are pretty well off and they get additional financial support from the future in-laws. We decided to call his sister to ask directly - she said she'd be so over the moon to come to our state. She'll \"make it work with no problems\".\n\nFianc\u00e9's sister briefly mentioned they've been in touch, and the ILs have started passive-aggressively asking for an exact date. At this time we discovered some news with my health and shared it with them. No words from his dad - which is fine. But then a few days later, out of nowhere he texted us to say he\u2019s planned all the logistics for a 2 weeks anniversary holiday in November and asked us to OK the payment. Those were 2 weeks of our chosen month for the wedding... My partner was annoyed by the lack of communication and just sent back that he doesn't have confirmed details yet. We got back \"Ok\" and no further comms. We found out later from his sister that they spent two weeks talking about how we aren't sharing information and are causing tension and stress (and depression). They went from doing fantastic (according to our last call) to needing a psychologist weekly. But they're still not going to reach out to us because \"they don't want to offend us\". F\u2019s sister told them she's had enough and don't want to hear it anymore\u2026 That's when we received another text, only this time ILs are letting us know they're going ahead with booking their holiday unless we have a confirmed date. We told them that if they want to, we are very open to have a call to chat about where the wedding planning is at. Radio silence and no calls since.\n\nWe've been so stressed, my partner and I started arguing. We finally realized we needed to see a couple's counsellor - only to discover my fianc\u00e9 has a violently abusive childhood that he thought was an ordinary part of everyone\u2019s childhood. It has brought us somewhat closer and I am trying to support him through this new revelation, and he's trying to support me through being triggered by this, now very obvious, revelation. But I'm too triggered - they've now started directly degrading and insulting me. My partner shuts down and says, \"there's nothing to talk about because it's just the usual passive aggression.\" Fortunately, he came around that time to understanding how these comments are hurtful. \n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time I\u2019ve had issues - the dad has blamed me for \u201cpotentially having a past with sexual abuse\u201d for my reactions to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s granddad sexualizing me and touching me inappropriately. Back then I brushed it off as uneducated. He also recently blamed me for intruding in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s space when F got aggressive towards me. I was not OK with that.\n\nBut talking about our future and this situation with my fianc\u00e9 sometimes feel like pulling teeth. He now wants to do a legal signing in secret, and no longer wants to consider his parents. I just know this will blow up without careful consideration. We haven't even announced our engagement publicly or to our friends because we cannot think straight. I don't know what to do anymore.\n\ntl;dr: think I might be marrying into another Nfamily. Didn\u2019t see it before. Don\u2019t know what to do now.

So excited to finally move on with life.\n\nHello, I am a 33 year old woman. I have been on a \"healing\" journey for the past 15 years. I was the \"identified patient\" in my family of two parents and one older sister, meaning I was the one who was always outwardly struggling, always messing up, the \"problem child.\" My older sister had a severe eating disorder but that was a lot more subtle and invisible than my symptoms. I struggled with substance abuse in my late teens\/early twenties, always had depression\/anxiety, had several weird codependent romantic relationships, etc. Interestingly, I've also had many external achievements (academic and career success, being considered attractive, having really strong and loving longterm friendships), but I've had a gnawing feeling my whole life that there is something wrong with me.\n\nA year ago, I was newly married to a very emotionally avoidant and distant man (who I later learned was very, very similar to my mother). After 3 years of avoiding conflict at all costs, he snapped one day. He said things like \"You are way too emotional. Even though I told you I wasn't judging you for having emotions all these years, I was judging you the whole time.\" So that sucked. (To be clear, I am definitely a sensitive and empathetic person, but my emotions fall squarely in the \"normal\" range of expression. I am now a mental health professional and have learned that there's nothing abnormal about the way I experience or express emotions).\n\nBack to the divorce: what sucked even more than the rejection from my ex was that when I was feeling sad about it, my \"super supportive\" mother who has \"given everything to me and my sister\" (she is extremely identified with the martyr mother identity) said things like, \"Well, I can understand why he left you. I've been afraid of you ever since you were a baby because you would have these big emotions and then when I tried to comfort you, you always rejected me. Your sister was never like this. And just for the record, you ARE the most emotional person I know.\" It has taken me a year to realize: This is not just someone who is emotionally underdeveloped (the last few years I've been considering that she is maybe somewhere on the autism spectrum). This goes beyond a misunderstanding or miscommunication. This is abuse.\n\nShe completely isolated me from my dad from ages 12-30. I always believed he was the problem (in fact, my mother went to therapy for exactly one year after their extremely traumatic and drawn-out divorce and concluded that he is a narcissist. Oh, the irony.). Since reconnecting with him, I have learned that he is an extremely sensitive, expressive person who truly loves me and wants the best for me. I learned that he went to therapy after the divorce and was told that he had been emotionally abused by mother (she called him names, convinced him he was a terrible person, rejected his emotions, and to this day hates him and refuses to talk to him until he \"apologizes\" for the hundreds of things he did wrong in the marriage. Of course, only she knows what's on this long list of grievances). I also learned that she wrote a 70-page document in the divorce paperwork outlining what a terrible and unfit father he was, including covertly suggesting that he was a child sex abuser. Though I had issues with my dad, he NEVER did anything at all sexually inappropriate. I was 15 when the divorce was finalized and ever the covert narcissist, my mother would say things like, \"You should go see your dad if you want. I heard he's dating a new tramp but you should totally go see him if you want.\" The covert manipulation was honestly masterful. My mother is a very, very smart woman.\n\n I've also been subtly manipulated to believe I'd never be able to financially support myself without her. For example, she's a lawyer and was \"helping me\" create me financial statement for my divorce a year ago. She kept saying things like, \"Well he could never take anything from you with an income this low.\" Yikes. (For reference, I am a pre-licensed therapist making above the median income for someone at this stage in my career. Definitely not making a fortune, but also definitely able to pay my rent and bills just fine).\n\nSkip to now, I am about to move the city where my dad lives where the cost of living is high. I have an awesome job there and am so excited to be around really awesome community. I'm just so excited to rebuild my life in a new place after the divorce. When I said I was moving, all she did was a little silent treatment. And then added, \"Isn't it really expensive there?\" Thanks for the support, mom.\n\nFor the past 15 years I have been searching to figure out what's wrong with me. I've journaled and meditated nearly every day, gotten certified in different types of yoga, read every book imaginable about mental health and emotionally immature parents, and even went to graduate school to become a therapist. I never knew WHAT was causing my emotional pain, I just knew that I was in a huge amount of it and needed to find ways to feel better if I was going to survive. \n\nIt's like I've been a severe burn victim my whole life and have been trying to heal from the burns. I didn't have much space or emotional energy to figure out WHY I had the burns in the first place. And my child brain (as most child brains) concluded that I was just born broken, that it's been my fault. But I'm realizing now what CAUSED the burns. I have been systematically and subtly set on fire by this person my entire life. And then blamed and judged for being in pain.\n\nIt has been a huge mix of emotions. Mostly, I'm excited to move the fuck on with having this understanding. I've already processed so much anger\/pain towards her in journaling\/therapy\/etc. Thankfully, in recent years she has only ever wanted an extremely superficial relationship with me anyway; she texts me every few weeks for logistical updates on my life. \n\nThanks for reading.

I always thought it was normal to just hate living until I was kicked out at 15 after I admitted to my mother my biological father had been abusing me since the age of 4.\n Growing up, I always had a bad relationship with my mother. Out of all of her kids, I was the one who looked the most like my father. My mother resented me for it because my father was always out cheating and having children elsewhere. Because we had such an estranged relationship, people always thought I was a, \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl.\u201d He would always take me out, and everyone in the family always noted I appeared to be his favorite. What they didn\u2019t realize is my father had been sexually abusing me from an extremely young age. It didn\u2019t help that my mother is a sergeant for the police department in a big city and was always working night shifts. One day, as part of my homeschooled curriculum, my mother made me read the book, \u201cPush\u201d by Sapphire. If you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about, it\u2019s a book that details a young uneducated girl who is being raped by her father periodically that leads to her having multiple children. After being triggered by this book, I then decided to tell my mother about the 11 year long sexual abuse I had endured at the hands of my father. At first it seemed like she believed me, and then things started to get weird.\n   She\u2019d accuse me of lying at times, and at some point even told me that she believed me but thought it was evident that I had tried to, \u201cseduce him\u201dall because my father claimed I had crawled onto his lap when I was 4 and kissed him on the lips. Somehow this made sense to her. Things started getting more estranged especially when they finally split, eventually leading to my mother kicking me out once she found out I was a lesbian. She ruined my entire life without realizing it. \n     I went on to live in the streets with nowhere to go. Attempted to finish high school but was denied by every principle because they didn\u2019t have my mothers consent to enroll me. I attempted to get my GED and wasn\u2019t allowed to because of the strict GED requirements in my state. I then decided to scrap up enough money doing odd jobs until I could get a bus ticket to Florida which then allowed me to get my GED on my own, then allowing me to work full time as a minor. I attempted to go to college, but I was never able to make it work with minimum wage jobs paying out of pocket since I don\u2019t have her information to fill out fafsa. I have now moved back to the state I lived in where this originally happened, tried to press charges and failed miserably. I also found out she lied to my entire family and told them I ran away because I didn\u2019t like doing chores, even though she had me homeschooled because she needed me home to take care of her 8 other children (who she was a wonderful mother to by the way.) \n      I now recently discovered that my mother went on to marry a man she barely knew from a foreign country a year after kicking me out, and less than three months ago gave birth to twins. She has never tried to reach out to me despite having access to my social media for years until now. I\u2019ll admit, seeing my 8 siblings again for the first time in 6 years might be the best thing that could ever happen to me\u2026 but I don\u2019t know if allowing her to be in my life or forgiving her after she single-handedly ruined it is something I should do. Thoughts?\n\nEdit *** yes my main reason for wanting to give her the forgiveness she\u2019s asking for is mainly so I can see my siblings.

After my parents split up she developed an alcohol\/drug problem, became physically abusive, and lost custody of me after CPS became involved when I was 12. Her and I weren't on speaking terms for many years but I am now 27 and since I graduated college (and she got sober) we have been fixing our relationship. I now live in Florida and she lives in Michigan so I don't see her in-person often, which helps. Anyways...\n\n**Main post:** My mother has always been weird about her birthday. No matter what you do its either too little or too much, but its always not right. I remember my dad and her fighting over it when I was a child. On a good year she might be fine most of the day and then kinda shut down at some point, go to bed early, and then be fine the next day. On a bad year she explodes and starts fights with everyone (even in public) and will have a complete meltdown that results in her not talking to family for days or weeks.\n\nSince the death of her twin sister \\~10 years ago (who obviously shares a birthday with her) it has gotten worse, but its not a new phenomenon. Past two years as an example: In 2021 she refused to pick up the phone so I could wish her a happy birthday and then was upset\/held it over my head that I \"only texted her\" a happy birthday. The next year I sent her a card saying that I know this time of year is hard for her but that I love her\/her strength and that I hope she can use the spa giftcard I included to treat herself to something relaxing. My stepdad told me she tore it up and threw it away.\n\nThis year my stepdad and I flew her down to Florida for a week so she could enjoy being away from the cold temps and hit the beaches and stuff. On her birthday, we booked a trip to go kayaking with manatees and were planning a nice dinner near the ocean after. About 30 mins into our 3 hour kayak trip she started making it very obvious to us that she was upset but would not tell us why. She kept kayaking away from us so we asked if she just wanted some space and she eventually stormed off back to the boat launch and sulked there until we got out. Then we all drove the 2 hours back in awkward silence because she would not talk to us. She dropped me off at my house and said she was changing her flight to leave early. I didn't respond cos I knew nothing I could say would help. She then brought the flowers and gifts I had gotten her back to my house and left it on my porch and then blocked me on Facebook.\n\nWould it be wrong for me to set a boundary where I don't talk to her during the week of her birthday? I kind of want to go no-contact with her again and suggest she gets therapy, but I feel like that is maybe too drastic.

I was neglected, I was mentally, emotionally and psychologically neglected for years by you and by dad, which inevitably lead to my mental deterioration, and developmental disorders, as how I was raised was deteriorating and disordered.\n\nDad was\/is abusive, and believe me I've recognized that you were a victim of his abuse and to this day continue to be one, but there was a point in time, in my childhood, in my life, where you, my mother, became the enabler, inevitably the abuser yourself, which was something you have never rectified or have even come close to justifying, not by words, not by actions, and not by explanation. \n\nInstead I was smeared as a bad child, the scapegoat for simply reacting to the insanity that I was submerged in, a drunk of a father who screamed at me, threatened me, a father who I was terrified of and desperately wanted to be saved from, but in those moments, I had nobody, only a mother who never protected me from my abuser. A mother who never stood up for me, a mother who slept soundly as I cried, a mother who would run away when I confronted her about the abuse or displayed real emotions, a mother who never thought of me as a victim, but only a problem she had to minimize, cut down, as I grew taller to be more aware and outspoken, to her I was a weed infestation of the nice garden she had made, I had a mother who instead only cared for her own vanity, for the sake of her own reputation and the adoration she gained in her career, because to her knowledge if she physically appeared to do be doing the right things, who was to notice the abuse that transpired behind the sheer and superficial veil she'd dress herself in every morning before she went off to pretend for another day? Who was I to say anything as I was given the necessities to life? \nHow could I dare say that I was abused, and continually abused and neglected, how could I be so ungrateful? I must be such a brat, a bitch, a lazy slob who's been in bed for too long, a whiney doesn't know how good she's had it smart-ass who's on her last string. Those very judgements have been held over my head since the very moment I began to see things for what they really were, and call them for what they really are. Awaiting this hammer that would fiercely slam down with justice when I turned 18, a law saying I would be completely fucked, and would regret every word muttered from my mouth or thought of in my mind, as I was no longer a dependent of but a burden to, though, believe me you made me feel like that many years ago, many moments unseen and unheard, you will never know how you hurt me and continue to, you don't see me, because you haven't seen you. \nNot in the way I do, not in the way that I have.\n\nKept in your small world for so long, I was silenced, made to believe that what I was experiencing & witnessing was within reason. Though I had nearly lost my mind trying to discover that very reason. \n\nForgive me if I struggle to be empathetic and understanding when I was never given the luxury of such things so get a grip why don't you. \n\nAs close as I am to you, I feel so lonely; Didn't you see that I was alone without friend's mom? Didn't you see that I was alone without a community mom? Didn't you see I was alone without a family mom? Didn't you see that I was alone and without myself mom? \n\nYou gave me the bare necessities and now we barely have a relationship. \n\nAm I to blame? \n\nI've wanted to grow past these feelings of anger, hopelessness and depression, though in time, I realized, they were never mine in to begin with, \n\nInstead,\n\nOnly a torch you handed off to me because it contained a fire you were unable to control.\n\nNow I carry the very same torch, the only difference to you, is that now, I hold the fire you couldn't contain, without fear of what may be seen or heard, because the same fire that hurts you now, is the same fire you burned me with then because you were too afraid to know it's strength, to know how it feels to be burned by something you created and thought would stay a dim flame one that could be held in your hands forever.\n\nAnd if you feel a sense of resentment, blame yourself for handling fire so carelessly,\n\nYou burned down this house, \nhanding such a fire to a child,\n\nSo what do we do now? Do we let what remains rot and sink into the earth? Leaving an ugly sight scorned of what once was?\n\nOr do we throw away what is no longer salvageable and make way for a new foundation, make way to re-build with new material? \n\nOr do we let it be? Because where you leave it, it will remain, it will stay, until it decays, don't fear a thief, thieves only steal nice things. \n\nI will probably never know why you gave fire to me as a child. \n\nNow I'm an adult, do you want to burn down this house too? \n\nI have no new material to offer you, as I will be set on building my own, forgetting about the scorn. \n \n(this isn't about a house btw) \n\nI love you, but that isn't enough reason to go on like this, you're breaking my heart, only this time, I will walk away with it for good. \n\nMany have heard me, yet I feel enraged because the ones I scream to, are deaf to me.\n\nI need people in my life who aren't going to resent me for knowing, understanding and expressing why I deserved\/deserve better, those who acknowledge that my pain is real, that it's honest, as it always has been, and those who know they don't scare me, because I know they're only trying to scare away what they don't want to see of themselves. \n\nThe people that you've hurt will hold a mirror up to you, your reflection is undeniably the cause of your resentment, not them for holding the mirror so persistent, because even then, you cannot see them, as you cannot see past yourself, you are reflected, they cannot be perceived, because the only one to look to is you. \nThey stand behind the mirrors of what reflects you.\u00a0","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678421832.0},{"title":"im never going to feel safe","author":"thehalfbloodlex","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/11nb9t6\/im_never_going_to_feel_safe\/","text":"I recently moved into my first apartment with my twin sister and her boyfriend.

They kicked me out and I've since cut all contact with them. However, that has not stopped them from trying to force me into speaking to them. They held most of my belongings and furniture hostage and refused to let me have them, and sent me cryptic photos of them sitting outside my friend's house (where I was staying at the time) and refused to leave until my friend's husband threatened them with the cops. On top of that, they've continued to send me abusive messages, even going as far as creating new email addresses to try to contact me after I blocked them. \n\nI spend every waking moment terrified that they are going to show up at my work or something and that is not something I am emotionally able to handle right now. \n\nFast forward to today, my sister informs me that my parents are coming over this weekend. We've lived here a month and they've come over twice already. The first time I let slide because they 'helped her move in,' but this weekend there is literally no purpose. Why can't she just go to their house? Now I am left with the options of either: sucking it up and confronting them while thy're here, locking myself in my room for the extent of their visit, or leaving and going to a friend's house. I can't speak to my sister about it because she has already told me that she blames me for the situation with my parents so she is not going to be receptive to my concerns. \n\nI can't help but feel like I will never have somewhere that is mine.

I idolize him greatly, but I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s because he\u2019s my FP, or if it\u2019s because he was actually a good parent to me and now that I realize everything about my mom, he seems that much better. \n\nMy dad has never had much luck when it comes to romantic relationships and he\u2019s recently been in one with a girl I adore. She\u2019s so kind and funny and I think she\u2019s a great fit for my dad. Her ex(father of her kids) recently hit and killed a construction worker while drunk and she\u2019s freaking out and is going to move across the country to start over. I guess she\u2019s been wanting to move out of state for a while, but couldn\u2019t due to custody agreements with him. Now that he\u2019s going to jail though, it doesn\u2019t matter. But anyways, it Ultimately means her and my dad aren\u2019t going to work out. I\u2019ve been so torn over it and I bawl my eyes out thinking about it for him. He\u2019s so accepting and supportive of her and it\u2019s hurts me so bad to know he\u2019s never had a fair shot at love. My nMom being his first and only marriage\/serious relationship, he didn\u2019t get a great start, and since their divorce he hasn\u2019t had much luck either. I cannot think of him as a bad person even though he very openly talks about mistakes he\u2019s made in the past. I have no clue if he is my FP or if he\u2019s just a really great dad and I\u2019m only realizing how wonderful he is in comparison to my mom who I\u2019ve recently had the realization of being a narcissist. \n\nWhile I read this back, it doesn\u2019t seem like FP behavior for me at all, but I feel like it\u2019s different because the only other FPs I\u2019ve had have been romantic and obviously I don\u2019t feel that way towards my father, so maybe it changes the FP dynamic? I\u2019m also curious if it is just my nMoms abuse that makes me feel responsible for either of my parents emotions, narcissist or not. Unsure.

It was to the point of me believing maybe she cannot function in society anymore.  We went to a one hour lunch where he had to attend to her like a two year old baby.  Had flashbacks of this happening when I was probably six yo.\n\nAnyway.  I was trying to do my time- and making light conversation.
