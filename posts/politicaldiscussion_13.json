        "text": "The Republicans did worse than expected in the midterms. As a result, the moderate conservatives were required to have the full support of the staunch conservatives. This gave the staunch conservatives greater bargaining power, thus pulling congressional leadership to the right. \n\nThis seems like the opposite of how things should ideally work. In an ideal system, one would hope that a divided congress results in the center left and center right electing a compromise candidate as speaker. \n\nIronically, if the Republicans had done better in the midterms, there would have been less need for support from the staunch conservatives. So, a bigger Republican win would have resulted in a more moderate congressional leadership. \n\nOne can imagine a similar dynamic playing out in other governments. In a system with many different parties, a narrow win by the center right party may force them to form a coalition with the far right party. \n\nThis system works the opposite of how you would expect. In a perfect system, a divided legislature should force the moderates to form a compromise coalition. A big victory by a party should lead to a more staunchly conservative or progressive leadership, depending on which party won. \n\nIs there any way to fix this? Are there alternate methods of selecting the governmental leadership in the aftermath of an election? Or, would you argue that the system works fine as is? Thoughts?",
