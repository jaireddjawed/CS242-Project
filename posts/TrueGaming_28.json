        "text": "When it comes to third-person adventure games I find that there are usually only two forms of movement for your character: Fluid animations and freeform. Let me explain:\n\n* **Fluid** means the developers have made an animation for nearly everything. Jumping over obstacles, leaping into cover, running into people, sliding over hoods, etc. A good example is Watch Dogs 2. Marcus' fluid movements transitions smoothly across obstacles and environments. The good thing about this is the realism factor; with realistic animations for nearly every possible movement option, it all flows together seamlessly and really makes the character a part of the world. When Marcus runs in to people, he pushes them aside. When he leaps of a ledge he'll do a spectacular flip and land on his feet. However, the animations will only trigger in specific circumstances. In Watch Dogs 2, I raised a platform and had to get off, but I couldn't, because it was just a tiny bit too high for the animation to play out properly. So I had to lower it just a little bit for it to work. I wanted to go out on a small ledge, but Marcus would just fall down each time. Essentially, the system restricts you to where it wants you to move.\n\n* **Freeform**, meanwhile, does not have unique animations for every possible ostacle but does let you jump, crouch, run or otherwise avoid any obstacles with a simple button press. Its the same animation every time, but it has no restrictions and it does what it's supposed to. A good example would be Fallout 4. There, the PC only has one jump animation which is used for every single obstacle. There is no difference between jumping over a fence or a car. In WD2, there are two separate animations for those things. When running into NPCs, only they stagger back; the PC does nothing. When leaping off ledges, the PC just falls down. The good thing here is no restrictions; jump wherever you want, crouch wherever you want, even go wherever you want (like walking onto a tiny ledge), no triggers needed. But it is a bit less \"realistic\", I guess we can say.\n\nWhich one do you prefer? Me; I like both. It all depends on the game I guess. But these are just the two systems I've deduced; are there any other movement systems you'd like to mention?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8rp5qe/why_do_people_praise_the_metro_games_to_hell_and/",
        "text": "And this isn't bait, I genuinely feel alienated when I wander into any thread discussing Metro and see the endless, undying praise for it being one of the best series of all time. \n\nMetro and Metro Last Light were some of the worst video games I've ever played. I want to start with the upsides, because they were there and I can kind of see where some people were coming from. Metro was interesting. I liked the way many of the levels were lain out visually, and I can definitely see why it's praised for its atmosphere. The most fun moments of the game were those spent in the bleakest moments- exploring the dark and empty enemy-filled station for the bomb to seal the tunnel, defending the last line against an endless horde, wandering around the snowy city... it was impressive, no doubt. The absolute peak of the experience was the \"library\"- the enemies were genuinely frightening and I was constantly on edge. The world-building was also great- it was very clear to me who was who, why certain groups were doing certain things, and generally what my character was supposed to do. \n\nBut that's about all I can say, because everything else was such a horrible slog that it made me tempted to quit the series multiple times. It was utter mediocrity at the best of times, and horrible design at the worst. Let me start with the shooting: it sucks. I mean, wow, it's terrible. Ammo rarity meant that it only made sense to use a couple specific guns that had ammo up the wazoo, seeing as the more rare guns had very poor performances regardless. Shooting at humans was pretty alright- they had decent recoil from being attacked. But mutants were absolute nightmares to behold, because from their bizarre movement mechanics that often saw them flat out ignoring the bullets they were eating to charge on, to their broken hitboxes often causing point-blank shotgun shots to miss without reason, they were the purest form of annoyance. The worst offender was the absurd amounts of player recoil inflicted by an attack from a creature, to the point where shooting once hit was basically a lost cause because of their tendency to perform a couple quick swipes without pause and take out every chunk of health instantly. Add on to this the robotic animations and sluggish reloads, and you've got a truly pitiful shooting experience that often devolved into spray-and-pray rail shooting.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when the now-legendary Metro storyline completely failed to make up for this. The worst tendency of the narrative was for it to jarringly grind to a halt out of nowhere, and instead of being explained through well-written gameplay, be presented as a written monologue on the loading screen for the next level. This inexcusable laziness alone was enough to ruin the experience, but it got worse. After the boring and predictable \"go get help for your hometown\" plot played out (and after I had to reload an entire level due to the horrible gas-mask mechanic leading me to be unable to progress through scripted cutscenes without choking to death) I was presented with the most insultingly simplistic and pretentious resolution I have ever encountered. The game's single memorable piece of dialogue- \"If it's hostile, you kill it\"- was reduced to a way to insult and mock the player for wiping out the droves of blood-thirsty monsters the entire conflict had been built around. You see, the big \"twist\" was that these monsters were actually just misunderstood ol' softies who wanted to help humanity. Never mind that *the entire game was spent presenting these creatures as nothing more than mindless killers who wanted to horribly murder every human, including the protagonist at multiple points.* I genuinely had to check to make sure the story wasn't written by Stephen Moffat. You cannot possibly justify designing your narrative to guilt-trip the player over a decision you did nothing but encourage them to make and after giving them no information to suggest any other course was prevalent. It was so condescending it made me ill. And of course, let's not even get into the [hilariously bad dialogue](https://youtu.be/NEAwGzGsgjE?t=3s).\n\nUnfortunately, not ill enough to miss the disaster of a sequel. Last Light threw away everything I enjoyed about Metro and replaced it with mindless, crass, insulting garbage. I don't even want to think about the dreadful experience, so I'll stick to the most important points. It had the most inconsistent tone of anything I've ever played. The entire story doubled down on the first's pretentiousness (the game even starts with the obnoxious hippy boo-hooing to you about your supposed genocide, AGAIN) and blandness. It was one cliche after another- generic Xtreme action sequences with no player input, a betrayal predictable from the first time you meet the character, a forced and ludicrously brief romance with a woman you spend literally not more than 10 minutes with throughout the entire game and who's meetings with the protagonist can be counted on one hand, destroying giant hoards of enemies and machinery through a ridiculous power fantasy that made no canonical sense, a deadly virus (of course), a fight through a moving train where the rattling is so severe it makes it impossible to aim, an emo kid who helps you to piss off his dad, I can go on and on and on about what boring, uninspired tripe this joke of a story was. That isn't mentioning the (this word comes up a lot) pretentious morality system you need to adhere to to get the \"good\" ending, which encourages you to leave alive monsters who will probably go on to kill lots more people because KILLING = BAD, and actually discourages you from paying a prostitute that forces herself upon the protagonist who can probably barely afford food because SEX = BAD. Just as an example of how terrible the gameplay is, there's a segment at the very end where a tank roles onto the battlefield. The officer yells \"ON THE PLATFORM\" or something similarly nonsensical that doesn't explain anything, and the game expects you to figure out you need to *shoot the tank's wheels and blow it up*. Because shooting a vehicle designed to be bullet proof is definitely a reasonable conclusion for anyone thrust into such a battle to come to.\n\nI could go on, but I'm really sick of talking about these games, and I think I've said enough to make my reasoning at least understandable. It is my belief that the design in both Metro games (but particularly the latter) is unjustifiably bad, to the point of ranking near the bottom of the board. I don't think I'm going to change anyone's opinion on their apparently favorite franchise, but I needed to let loose my disgust at these video games.",

With Sunday around the corner, I’ll probably end up missing the GOG summer sale, but I’ve been taking a lot of time to look back on my stance when it comes to gaming. \n\nI’ve always been a person of both console of computer gaming from a young age, yet with the years passing and my resources becoming more limited, I’ve been wondering on how I should prioritize my gaming experiences. My catalog consists primarily of Indie Games (personal preference), and I’m wondering \n\nOn the one hand, I primarily use my MacBook Pro for work as a graphic artist, and wouldn’t want to wear the hardware out on it. Yet I’m also aware that sales for games are usually better on computers, and having them DRM free is certainly a plus. \n\nOn the other, I’d been given the PS4 as a gift by a close family member and have loved the AAA games available for it (usually physical copies). However, with the console most likely to be past its midlife cycle, I’m nervous about investing a large catalogue of digital games into it. \n\nI’ll have a little poll just for some quicker feedback if you guys would prefer that way. I’ll probably keep both platforms and don’t have plans to get any more at this time, so I’d appreciate some insight on which to invest more of my gaming passion in to.

        "text": "There's one thing all gamers have in common: we daydream about making a perfect game in some moment of our lives, not with the ambition of really doing it but for the pleasure of daydreaming.\n\nYesterday I was thinking about my idea of a casual, laid back racing game with 1vs1 duels and tons of customization to build your dream car, but 100&amp;#37; skill based on the actual duel. Then the problem appeared: if there's tons of parts to modify your car and tune it in lot of ways, why would anyone buy a part that's objectively inferior to another? Then I remembered the same thing happens in all mmorpgs, where there's a meta build for every class and if you don't stick to the meta most guilds won't even want you. Another less extreme example is the Monster Hunter series where even if all armors are useful because the skills matter more than the stats in that game, a set that can kill an elder dragon 2 minutes faster that another set is objectively better. I said is a less extreme example because ultimately is a co-op game without pvp, so it doesn't matter so much if you win in 10 or 12 minutes (although in the end-game you can see users REALLY demanding a meta build to join you).\n\nNow to the question: How can we make a game with customization and **without** min/maxing? Removing stats and making every change purely cosmetic would be too extreme, because there's some fun to be found in tuning your car, equiping your warrior or crafting a weapon. Adding a perk to every stat would work in theory but I don't know if it would work in practice; soon people would figure out that a weaker but faster weapon is objectively better than a stronger but slower, or vice versa. Although with the proper effort that system could work out, I'm just not sure.\n\nMy idea would be that between the best possible build and the worst possible, there wasnt a big gap; let's say 15&amp;#37;. So -and applying that to my idea of a racing game- if two players are very equal in skill, the player with most knowledge about tuning the car would win, but in any other case, that difference would never be enough to actually make you win. In this way min/maxing would not be erased, it would just be less important. I'm not 100&amp;#37; convinced that it would stop people from diving into the meta game and coming out with a build that's objectively better than everything else, but I can't think of a better idea.\n\nPS: I am fully aware that min/maxing shouldnt dissapear from the gaming world, and that many people enjoy it. I am not judging the meta game neither I am saying that a game without min/maxing would be better. With this topic I'm only trying to make a debate and a mental exercize about how a game could work without that.",

Somehow we were introduced to Soul Calibur.  We had no idea what we were doing, we just knew we liked big swords and juggling each other.  We actually ended up being almost competent players, eventually.\n\nThat happened because we were both starting from scratch, which made the process fun.\n\nNow, though?  Who bothers to play anything locally, at any age?  Convincing a friend to try some new game out at your place just doesn't happen.  Unless it's Smash Bros., of course, which is why Smash keeps growing in popularity!  (I'll absolutely be playing SmUsh, because I actually have friends who play it.)  Online, in most fighters you're thrown to the wolves, against 200 or so players you have little hope of learning anything from, and oftentimes they'll resent you for being so clueless.\n\nIf you *do* want to play locally, you need to just hope the FGC has a presence in your area, and if they do, I've found it rare for them to really tolerate someone who has no idea what they're doing, because why should they?\n\nSure, most games have a \"training mode\", but that won't really prepare you for actually playing, just lay some of the groundwork.\n\nFighters are at their best when someone is sitting next to you. As people stop playing local multiplayer in a more casual setting, though, that oppertunity never really shows up for someone who isn't already onboard.  Street Fighter IV is credited with sort of reviving the genre, but I think the revival will be short-lived, because people just don't play together anymore.",

Games like the Metro series, the Fallout and the Elder Scrolls series I have started playing, but I don't make it much farther than an hour or two in before I stop. I can't pinpoint the reason why exactly, but it sucks because they are all great games to play, and I dont get to experience the full game.\n\nWhen I was younger in the PS2 era, the games were mostly all single player, and I had no problem playing them from start to finish, even multiple times. The Ratchet &amp; Clank and the Jak series' were (and still are) my favorite games of all time. It could be because back in those days, I only had a few games, and when I wanted to play something it was either those or nothing. But I truly love those games, and I could still play them over and over again to this day.\n\nBack to my main point, I would love to get back into single player games, and with some sequels that were shown at E3 like Metro: Exodus and TLOU: Part 2, I'd love to replay (or play for the first time) the predeccessors.\n\nIn the age of multiplayer games, I almost feel lonely playing games by myself, and wonder if that could be why I don't play them. I've tried streaming some gameplay of FO4, and that definitely helps (when I have viewers), although it seems like everyone on twitch wants to watch Shroud or whoever else play PUBG. I'm not knocking this, as that's their culture and that's fine.\n\nFinal Points and/or TL;DR: Does anyone else struggle playing single player games but find relief when you're playing with some people who are also interested in the game? Streaming games these days reminds me of playing games on the couch in the old days, when you had friends who were interested but would rather watch and enjoy while you played. Are there any communities or would anyone be interested in some group \"let's plays\" where people play single player games and enjoy the stories together?\n",

        "text": "I finally got around to playing Dying Light and I think it's one of the best games I've ever played. A lot of this has to do with gameplay, but most of it comes from how well done the world is. I don't think I have ever come across a more grounded, authentic, and unique setting before. I wouldn't say it's fully \"realistic\" given it's science fiction, but it's certainly grounded. A whole week in, and I'm still blown the fuck away by it all. It's easy to feel like I'm really there.\n\nWhat REALLY contradicts this and lowers the bar is that none of the characters or dialogue are remotely authentic. You have a truly immersive setting that is close to real life supported by a cast who regularly make terribly corny jokes and overall speak like they're not in the middle of a nighmarish pandemic. I love this game dearly, but I hardly know what's going on because I can't stomach the cutscenes. I don't even mind humor, but what I'm given here is a bad sitcom writing. This makes no sense for what the developers wanted to (and mostly did) achieve.\n\nGTA is a bad example because it's literally designed to be satire, but every game presents a varyingly realistic city (in 5 it's indestinguishable from real life) filled with pedestrians who talk about sticking things up their ass, giving people STDs and having sex with animals. AGAIN - BAD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S SATIRE. But you should get it.\n\nHitman 2016 is as well done as Dying Light and is MOSTLY mature, with some of the best voice acting, aside from corny NPC dialogue that is poorly done.\n\nAnyone get where I'm going with this? There are many more examples, for sure. It's not about disliking humor. The Fallout games as an example do it well. This is about extremely out of place writing and acting.",

        "text": "Difficulty settings have been part of many games for quite some time now, but it seems as if though plenty of developers have this idea that difficulty is making the player character more vulnerable while making everything else more resistant to damage.\n\nOf course preferences differ, but to me this makes a game way more tedious and unbalanced to the point where I'll always have a better experience playing the game on the standard difficulty as the dev team probably intended.\n\nBasically the experience of playing Skyrim and Witcher on the highest difficulty feels like role-playing as a piece of wet paper slowly picking away at a bunch of living boulders. It would make sense if it was a fight against an actual rock golem, but when it takes 20 hits to kill a Drowner with a sword specially designed to slay monsters, while that same Drowner can merely give a heavily armored, magic-infused Witcher 5 hits to get a game over, is not only just unrealistic, it's not fun.\n\nSo how about instead having a difficulty system be: \"X times damage taken and 1/X damage dealt\", we can have \"X times damage taken and X damage dealt\"?\n\nLook at Hotline Miami for example. Literally everything in that game, including the player, dies in one hit. it's because of this that the game is usually so frantic and difficult, but still fair. Look at Dark Souls as another example, most of the normal enemies die relatively easily, but can mess up the PC just as quickly when caught off guard.\n\nPlaying Stalker on the highest difficulty is just as brutal as playing any other game on the highest difficulty, but the major difference is the player is still relatively on par with all of the other characters in the game. It's infuriating to die ten times to a bunch of soldiers shooting at you from a distance, but when you sneak up to them, peak around a corner and deliver a few well placed shots before they even know you're there is very satisfying. With this difficulty system, the element of surprise actually counts.\n\nAnother example is Skyrim's Wildcat mod which does basically the same thing. And there are no words that describe how much better this mod makes the Skyrim experience. Fus Ro Dah matters much MUCH more, because now stunning enemies is the difference between life and death. Finishing moves happen all the time now, you don't have to awkwardly wave your sword in a bandits face for 30 seconds before the finishing move happens. Seeing a whole camp of Forsworn running toward you and then seeing your character perform multiple different finishing moves happen in quick succession really makes you feel badass.\n\nSo yeah, this was something I've been thinking of for quite a while now, and it confuses me why so many AAA devs insist on this unfair, unbalanced, tedious and repetitive idea of what a higher difficulty should be like when a much better alternative can be implemented",

He follows a radio signal that’s faint at first, but becomes clearer as he goes nearer towards it. Nomad is hinted to be a soldier throughout the story and is shown memories of his life from childhood to adulthood. He also comes across a child that faintly looks like a younger version of himself, a mysterious man in a trench coat and trilby who gives him directions and helps him fend off shadow figures (who are the enemies in the story), and a skeletal horse that he uses to travel across the world. \n\nI have other ideas for what I’d want to do too.

        "text": "A new demo of the upcoming Nintendo Switch Game \"Octopath Traveler\" released today, I enjoyed the previous demo and I was looking forward to give it another go.\n\nSadly, In my opinion the new prolouge demo is a huge step back from the last. I'm annoyed by certain \"improvements\" they added to make the game more convenient but ultimately more streamlined as well.\n\nEverywhere on the screen are now symbols for the npcs, quests and savepoints: Just by looking to the symbols alone (which distract you from the gorgeous optic) you know who you can talk to and who not, there are many silent npc's without any marker which are not talkable. \nThat leaves a much more lifeless impression because those npc's are getting their speech bubble symbol \"unlocked\" after the player made some progress or is pursuing a sidequest. So they resemble much more robots or event trigger than just ordinary people. All of that wasn't the case in the previous demo.\n\nAlso they highlight to you which of the npcs give you a sidequest, so that it's ensured you won't miss anything. \nYou don't have to explore a village on your own any longer, just look on the screen for an orange speech bubble icon. \nThat means the player knows from the start which npc is \"important\" and who is giving you just some text to read. It totally changes the style how you see- and how you are going to play the game. It also takes away the potential to find something hidden, the satisfaction of exploring and getting rewarded for your own observation is completely lost. There is no amount of surprise anymore in this regard.\n\nThere are also some other new additions: A radar (which is luckily concealable) that guides you everytime to your next destination point (for side- and main quests), quick-travel from almost any point in the game which reduces the danger and the feeling of an travel, descriptions who pop on the upper-left corner on the screen to tell you exactly what you have to do next. \n\nIt almost feels like they took inspiration from Ubisoft, the game feels much less organic and much more articifical. Honestly I don't like that trend. \nThe more information you give the player the more transparent the games becomes, the less suprises are waiting for you. \nI believe that design decisions like that, will give the player that urge to get forcefully 100% for the game, even if it doesn't make that much fun. It's just because the whole game is already layed out to you, you can't miss anything, all the time you are remembered of what you have done, but much more critical what you don't have done, that always gives you the impression that you miss something. That makes completion such a chore sometimes, but at the other hand you get a bad feeling by letting things out.\nAt least I can observe such phenomenons on myself. \n\nAll of the complains sound just like some minor details, but their impact is greater than it seems, because it affects your mindset of how you see and experience the game. \n\nRegarding Octopath I don't get that feeling of disappointment off. \nSince the game is close to release, I'm pretty sure that those additions to the demo are final.\n\nThat problem isn't new, many modern games are designed in that fashion, but Octopath Traveler is a recent example where you could get some insight about the development to the much more streamlined experience as it is now, because the previous demo originates from an older build of the game, where certain design decision weren't made yet or were based on feedback from the players.\n\n",

        "text": "A thought just popped into my head, and it has to do with my expectations of sequels versus my opinion of the game when it actually releases. Let me think of two franchises that I absolutely adore, Fallout and Metal Gear Solid. In 2015 F4 and MGSV were released. Before the release of each game, I had more or less decided how much I would like each game. With Fallout 4 I was right, and Metal Gear Solid V I was wrong. With F4, I thought I would enjoy it less than 3 but more than Tactics. And I was right, my expectations were met and I was neither disappointed nor enthralled with Fallout 4. With Metal Gear Solid V however, I thought I would enjoy it more than Peace Walker but less than 2. Instead, I enjoyed it less than 4 but more than Ground Zeroes. For reference, my personal ranking of the Fallout series goes: 2&gt;1&gt;NV&gt;3&gt;4&gt;Tactics (haven't played Shelter or BoS) My ranking of the MGS series (of the ones I've played) goes: 3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;PW&gt;PortableOps&gt;4&gt;5&gt;GroundZeroes&gt;MG2&gt;MG1&gt;Rising. In other words, I was horribly disappointed with MGSV, I never expected it to be the best in the series but I did think it would be better than it actually was. And the fact that it fails to meet my expectations left a bitter taste in my mouth that Fallout 4 didn't, despite the fact that both are just okay games in great series. I'm wondering if I'm the only one who prematurely judges games before I know much about them based on things like the history and trends of the industry and developer. I find I'm already judging TESVI as being better than Oblivion but worse than Morrowind despite the fact that I know literally nothing about it except that Bethesda is working on it. (For reference my opinion of TES goes Morrowind&gt;Skyrim&gt;Oblivion) And if I like it more than Morrowind, I'm sure I'll be praising it, if I like it less than Oblivion I'm sure I'll be hesitant to buy the next game in the series.

        "text": "##**Warning: Wall of text inbound. Hopefully it's compelling.**\n\nAs a casual student of game design, I often find it interesting to go back down the evolutionary trees of genres and find points at which things might have turned out differently: Good ideas that got lost, perhaps because of technological limitations, or just because they fell from the zeitgeist. The RPG genre is one of the most fruitful specimens for this sort of retrospective, as it has a rich and extensive history and encompasses a vast variety of approaches to game design.\n\nThe RPG tree centres around a single central split: that between digital RPGs and tabletop ones. The former grew from the latter, and early examples show direct influence, but their modern endpoints involve amazingly little cross-pollination.\n\nIn some ways, this is entirely sensible. *Mechanically*, modern digital RPGs are based on complex numerical synergies that couldn't possibly be replicated in an analogue game. Similarly, a good tabletop game captures a degree of flexibility and human-directed storytelling that is currently impossible to replicate in a purely digital experience. The two strands have diverged drastically because what works for one is entirely different to what works for another.\n\nBut RPGs are not just about mechanics. They're about storytelling. And here I find some fertile ground for new ideas.\n\nTabletop RPGs are based on dynamic storytelling. And, ultimately, that storytelling comes mostly from the little box on the character sheet marked 'flaws'. The best tabletop characters aren't the most technically accomplished, or the most numerically min-maxed; they're the characters who fuck up in interesting ways, creating a compelling narrative in the process. Some D&amp;D players describe this as handing the DM 'knives' with which to stab the party. It's a non-arbitrary source of adversity that encourages good role-play. Sometimes characters will fail or die as a result. But, whatever happens, it makes for a more interesting story than \"we went to the woods and killed ten bears because an NPC wanted ten bear-arses\".\n\nBizarrely, though, the idea of the flawed character is largely absent in digital RPGs. *Every* character is a power fantasy. *Every* character can do everything, follow every questline, choose every option. Even when options are greyed out, it's due to a lack of a certain strength, rather than a weakness. The most blatant example is, of course, the Skyrim approach, wherein a stealth-archer can become the head of the Thieves' Guild, Fighters' Guild, Assassins' Guild, and Mages' Guild, all by completing a couple of generic quests for each. Even when the game forces the player to commit to an exclusive option, it's through a binary player-choice, and has nothing to do with who the *character* is. A Khajiit thief can become Stormblade of the Stormcloaks, despite the fact that they're xenophobic nationalist bigots (and religious fundamentalists to boot) who wouldn't piss on a foreigner if they were on fire.\n\nNow, there are of course exceptions - I'm hardly the only one to ever have thought about this - but modern digital RPGs are far too afraid to tell the player \"No, this character can't do that\". Personally, I think that's a huge mistake, one that holds many games back from creating compelling narratives. Am I completely off the mark with this? Do you prefer RPGs that allow you to do anything? Or would you be interested in an RPG that asks the player to pick flaws and restrictions on character creation to balance out their strengths? I'm very interested to hear other people's opinions on the topic!",

After weighing some options on the matter, and with the GOG summer sale coming to a close soon, I’ve been rethinking my approach to gaming quite a bit. \n\nEarlier posts will show you guys that I’d been scrambling over wether to get several games for my MacBook Pro at a reduced price, or wait til after the sale and see if they’ll be cheaper for PS4 at a later time. I’d been hesitating about committing to full PC gaming since I work from my laptop as it is, and because I’d received said PS4 as a gift from a close family member. \n\nAt this time, I’m Thinking I’ll stick with getting only exclusives for PS4 from here on out, limiting my future digital purchases on it to either exclusives or titles that can be played on both the PS4 and the Vita (I have one of those as well). I already have several multiplatform games that I’d gotten on my PS4 before I was even aware of GOG’s existence,meaning they’ll be stuck on my PSN account for all time (also assuming they won’t transfer over to the PS5 down the road)\n\n Also, from here on I’m imagining that I ought to stick with purchasing multiplatform digital games on MacBook from GOG, that way they could be transferred over to a larger computer in the future should I be fortunate to obtain one. I’d still run the risk of buying a defective digital copy and being unable to return it, but my intuition tells me that shouldn’t be too much of a hassle. \n\nThose are just my thoughts at this time; if this seems like a flawed approach, I’d be open to critique or alternative suggestions.

I remember it had four player co-op and the objective of the game was to defend against waves of aliens then move onto the next area and repeat. In the video I watched, it showed a guy going up to chests that scattered across the ground and when he opened them he got an upgrade. Lastly, at the end of each location there was a boss. The comment section mentioned it was a remaster/remake or a sequel. I can't remember which. Thanks for the help! :)",

        "text": "Playing several different games, one thing I have noticed is that in games with multiple weapon options. (Swords, bows, daggers, maces, etc.) if there is a type of weapon which is used by throwing it, whether it is javelins, shurikens or throwing knives, it seems to almost invariably be a sub-par option. (Unless it's explosive, then it *may* be OK)\n\nReasons for this I have seen;\n\n-Limited ammunition which you have to find/buy, while ranged options with free/far cheaper ammunition exist (magic, bows if arrows are not tracked, etc.)\n\n-bonuses only for the ammo type used, while other ranged weapons often have both ammo and the weapon itself which may have their own independent special properties. \n\n-Lack of high level equipment. There are legendary swords and maces and spears and sometimes bows, but legendary javelins?\nThe best thrown weapons are often comparable to mid-tier weapons of other types, and often rather expensive to use regularly.\n\n-Low ammo capacity. Some games limit the amount of thrown weapons you can carry far more stricly than the ammo for other weapons.\n\n-Short range/poor accuracy compared to other ranged options.\n\n-They are often seemingly meant to be used as secondary weapons, in games where the levelling system tends to make using more than one type of weapon unoptimal at best, suicidal at worst.\nIn games where you invest some kind of \"skill point\" dividing them between different weapon skills is often unwise, (one way of doing 2x damage vs 2 ways of doing 1x damage) and in games where specific skills are improved by using them, the less used secondary weapon tends to become completely useless compared to the main weapon over time.\n\n-These downsides don't come with compensating dps/dpt boost compared to other options, or the boost is too small to make them a viable/good option.\n\nAny thoughts about why developers seem to have hard time balancing them, or maybe they make them intentionally weaker? Why? Realism? Challenge-playtroughs? Bulk content not really meant to be used? \n\nGood examples of games where throwing weapons are/aren't useless?\n\n",

I can't pay for flights, nor do I have investments to fall back on if the plan fails, and I'm thinking it's impossible to get in the scene.\n\nThis idea started when I was looking for a team to play CS competitively with. No team in the WORLD will give me a shot. Usually, nowadays the situation is \"Oh, we need a team member for [Game Title Here]. Let's just get a washed-up old player from another game for it!\" It's impossible to get your foot in the door.\n\nThen here comes things like Pro League and Challenger leagues, or the exclusive rights to orgs for games like Overwatch, and I'm discouraged. Why make a team if I can't get the chance to play. Great players never have the chance they need, and, while I'm not one of them, I want to give someone else the opportunity I never got.\n\nI don't know what to do. I need a second opinion.\n\nI'm not asking for people to work with, or tryout forms or whatever. I'm just wondering if other people are in the place I'm in now, Unsure if they should go for it. Advice is appreciated, and I hope I post this in the right sub for it. Have a nice day!",

        "text": "With us being so close to E3, I was wondering just where future would take us and which paths are the most likely the game industry will set its foot on and would like to hear others opinions and/or predictions.\n\nWith 'Live Services' being as old as World of Warcraft with the goal of keeping players engaged and encourage payments is an aspect that I think is (IMO), unfortunately, going to stick around unless there is a crack in new tech (VR for example) or the audience and their demands change.\n\nWho knows when that change will come.\n\nWhile I myself despise it in this very day and age, it's not that it exists, but the fact that some/most publishers and/or developers are making 'Live Services' without the added benefit to the player game experience. It's mostly made with the intent of player retention and appeals to microtransactions, alongside most of the ideas being implemented from the Free-To-Play mobile market.\n\nNext, I'm wondering whether Mind Uploading will have any place in the future of the industry. As cool and interesting as VR is, it obviously has its limits, particularly virtual space that is bigger than the physical space which the player inhabits. So movement controls have to be implemented that may not be halfway natural or nauseating. Meanwhile what if it was possible to transport yourself to a dream-like state that we experience when we're asleep? To be able to build and experience games the same way we experience dreams. But who am I kidding, that's probably going to take 200-500 years develop.\n\nLastly, there is diversification of games, or more appropriately how it'll change. We all know that Video Games are big business and at the moment it's split into either small-scale Indie titles and huge AAA studios (with rare instances of the middle market AA games). It's clear that the freshest experiences are found in the Indie market and the AAA market is always skeptical about investing in anything new unless it's a guaranteed smash hit. Though I'm wondering if big companies could set up new small teams to work up small 'indie-like' games. To see if there could be some special mechanics or ideas that could be thrown around here and there that could then be made into a game. Then see if you could expand that game into a AAA, maybe a AA or keep it small and 'Indie-like' and sell it that way. There are AAA games from today that started out this way such as GTA but (again) this won't change for some time...\n\nDo you have other bets to place on the future?",

The massive mountains and towers are incredibly effective the game world feel large, though it rarely interacts with other mechanics in the game, such as combat or puzzles. While you can use jump attacks off cliffs, the situation to use such a skill is rare, and doesnt really work with the massive heights and significant fall damage the game has at the same time.\n\nWhat are some games you think have used vertical space in an interesting and fun way?

        "text": "I'm super biased here. \n\nWhen I got the Xbox 360 halfway through it's life cycle, I felt like there were a significant number of games to choose from, and many more on the horizon. \n\nSo I bought the Xbox One almost as soon as it released, but noticed there were no \"must-have\" games for it. I bought the remastered Sleeping Dogs first...and since then, I've rebought most of the games I played on the 360, except remastered for the Xbox One. \n\nWhen the Xbox One X was announced, I bought that too...and AFAIK, there was no immediate gain by doing this. Very few games had 4k capability months after the launch, and when they did (for example, Fallout 4), they played just as poorly as they did on the Xbox One, but with maybe slightly more detailed textures. The \"60 FPS, 4k gaming with no load times\" hope never came to fruition. And Crackdown 3 was supposed to premiere with the console, but now I believe it has delayed until Spring 2019. \n\nLooking back, my Xbox One experience has been roughly 62% remastered games, and 38% new games. (based on 58 games played since Sleeping Dogs)\n\nOf all games I own right now, less than 10 are 4k capable. \n\nI recall at one point being interested in VR coming to Xbox One....announced in 2017, I haven't heard much since. \n\nWith the new console supposedly dropping in 2020, would you upgrade?

        "text": "**The problem**\n\n\nSo you have just arrived at your very first day in your new workplace, you find a lot of strangers, sitting there, working, chatting with each other and so on. Being the sociable person you are, you decide to walk over to each and everyone of them to get to know them a little bit better. You walk to the first guy, who is sitting on his desk minding his own business and working on his computer, once you just bump to his chair he stand up and start talking to you, you spend a minute or so talking back and forth while standing up next to his desk.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOnce the conversation is over, you eye two people sitting right next to that desk. You do the same thing, bump to one of them, they both take turns to talk to you, surprisingly the conversation you hold is basically the same as you had with the guy, yet they didn't say anything until you went over to them.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis is not how conversations work in real life, why they work like that in games?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**A good example**\n\n\nIn the fantastic thriller game oxenfree, you talk to others in a way that resembles real life much more closely, in this game, when somebody talks to you, or someone else, or even to himself, dialogue options pop-up in a speech bubble over your player head, you have directional keys tied to each dialogue choice, so you can select your choice swiftly. The dialogue options also show up when somebody still hasn't finished their sentence, allowing you to interrupt them, if you also wait too long, the options disappear and different ones reappear depending on what extra new information has been said.\n\n\nif we look closely at how this game works, we can notice the following special characteristics about the dialogue system:\n\n\n1. Shows up in any situation, you can talk to people while on a different floor to them (if you can hear them), or while doing something, there is no need to activate speech with anyone.\n2. You can interrupt someone with dialogue, not a skipping button (in a way that feels natural), you can comment over other people dialogue that doesn't involve you at all (if there is something to say)\n3. You can say nothing for the whole game, characters will acknowledge your silence.\n\n\nSo, basically like real life. The game's fluid and natural way of conversing with NPCs is a huge part of why it works so well. It never feels like \"gamey\", you never feel the urge to skip every line of dialogue, you just find yourself naturally selecting options without thinking twice about what you are saying, just like real life.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**So should games just copy that system?**\n\n\nLet's call this system context aware dialogue system, how would this system work in a much more complicated non-2d game like for example fallout or skyrim? The biggest problem is the much more complex controls, there is no way to assign keys to dialogue options or having dialogue options popup randomly while you are being attacked by mudcrabs.\n\n\nFallout 4 was smart enough to actually adapt something similar to oxenfree, when you approach someone, dialogue options will appear right away with easy hotkeys for each option for quick activation, but what if that person is not right in front of you?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Purposed idea**\n\n\nSo I purpose an implementation that may work with such games, I call it, again, the context aware dialogue key, an extra key assigned for just dialogue.\n\n\nThis is how it should work, the key is active all the time, but the options for dialogue that shows varies widely. When you press the key 3 or less dialogue options appear while holding the key, the game will slow down a bit to allow you to read the options (but if times run out, the options vanish, depending on the situation).\n\n\nLet's say if you are basically attacking someone, the dialogue options could be several taunts, if you are in a dark cave, the dialogue options could be different ways to voice your displeasure and so on. The options will be smart enough to show basically what is viable at the moment, combing more choices if it makes sense. (so if your \"this place sucks\" options are viable and talking to someone is also viable, both will show).\n\n\nNow to talk to someone, you approach him/her (obviously) or just be in the near vicinity to him/her, dialogue options will show dialogue options to get his attention or to greet him if he is already looking at you (hey! hello!), if there are several people near you, dialogue options will reflect that (hey James! or hey Joe!), if the persons are people you don't know, it can change to reflect appearance (first option: hey! two people near you look at you, more options appear: guy with the red shirt! girl with the blue pants!). Finally if people are talking about something while near you, dialogue options will be available to get into the conversation, the options will change as their conversation goes on, even if you didn't say anything.\n\n\nIf you do not select anything in any cases, the options will vanish after a while, if you call for someone and not say anything, they might just say \"idiot!\" and return to their business or just shrug it off. While you are talking to someone, there is always a dialogue option to cut the chase or tell him you are not interested (I don't care about that! get to the point!) rather than good old skipping button. The NPC may not respond favorably to you saying that, thus making skipping actually narratively relevant, you could get to play as an asshole who doesn't hear people at all, just like real life!\n\n\nIt sounds incredibly complicated, but we have contextual everything in games right now, animations, kill moves, scripts, based on multiple factors, there is no technical reason why the dialogue system has to remain the same \"trigger to activate\" system that remained as it is from the dawn of gaming. If Batman can shove a guy's face to the wall next to him just because he happened to be next to it, then you should be able to call your partner NPC from across the room!\n\nThank you for reading all of this and please discuss away your suggestions on the topic.",

        "text": "I was very excited to hear about [Vigor](http://vigorgame.com/about), a game set in Tromsø (Northern Norway), a city in which I lived for 7 years. There's something very appealing about controlling a character in an environment you've physically experienced. After watching a few videos, however, I was kind of disappointed to find out that I couldn't really recognize any buildings, landmarks or even terrain. The general atmosphere was sort of familiar, but still didn't feel like something I've experienced. Of course this particular game is still in development and this fact may change.\n\nThen I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qjha9/i_walked_from_sanctuary_to_diamond_city_in_real), where OP photographed some real life counterparts of locations in the Fallout series. This time, the in-game locations and buildings bear some resemblance to their real life counterparts, but pretty vaguely at that.\n\nAnd so I came to wonder - why is it that developers intentionally stray from their references? I get that there are technical things to consider (polygon count, map design/playability, player interaction and so on), but I feel like this alone can't describe the distance between reality and the games that claim to portray it. As an example - take colors and architecture (style, materials). If you modeled a real area accurately, you would be recreating the *actual* atmosphere in said area. If your game was post-apocalyptic, you could of course make changes to reflect some imagined past happenings, but those changes would affect all buildings in similar ways and it would still feel authentic.\n\nIn some cases I guess it makes sense from a security perspective to not model buildings with perfect accuracy (e.g. The White House), but most buildings aren't The White House, so this argument doesn't really apply in most cases.\n\nThoughts?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8qm0lu/about_vampyr_and_the_insulting_tribute_to_the/",
        "text": "I was playing VAMPYR, and while a bit charming and intriguing (the setting) i really felt insulted as a player, especially by the quests, the hint system, and uprade/progression mechanics.\n\nIt seems that this game was made by designer who either just played a couple RPGs in their lives or didnt even ask RPG players what makes these game good, and thus failing at all these mechanics.\n\n1. The Quests\n\nas perfectly shown by the abysmal \"Tribute to the victims\" quest, most of the \"investigations\" (thats how the game calls their quests) are insulting to our intelligence. \n\nSo you can understand (no meaningful spoilers), that quest has you talk to a guy, go to an aera on the map (in all quests, the player automatically knows to which zone he must go \\- it will be marked as a red circle on the map), see a grave (in the middle of a backalley), then the character says something like \"i need to find flowers\" (keep in mind, you almost never pick up items from the ground in the game), and, wait for it, you back track and just  behind you lays a flower pot ON THE GROUND. You pick it up (it is literally 5 feet away \\- what kind of designer decided \"hey lets put the flower just there, it will be easier\"), turn around, click on the grave, quest done.\n\n(here is the quest log [https://guides.gamepressure.com/vampyr/guide.asp?ID=45042#NH3\\_5](https://guides.gamepressure.com/vampyr/guide.asp?ID=45042#NH3_5) )\n\nRidiculous. It kills the game. Most if not all the quests are like that, fetch or go kill, with A to B to C travel.\n\n2. The Hints\n\nIn the game you talk to the NPCs, who are, i must admit, sometimes interesting, they seem real, are not all pretty faces, and somewhat have a backstory. \n\nBut then as soon as you enter dialog you can see that dialog options are there but hidden (so you are like \"i need to unlock this\"). You need \"hints\" in order to open these dialog options, for that you need to find items in the game world and/or talk to other people related to that NPCs. But ALL that work is for what ? opening up the story ? getting a special quest ? NO.... it just maximize the XP you can get if you kill that NPC (drinking his blood). Hum. But killing NPCs is just (1) to make the game easier (fast level up, so more skills) but a bit chaotic (more enemies).... it's thus so disconnected to the hint system which is more \"story\" oriented. it's like they ideas of rough game mechanics but didnt know how to mix it together. and it all feels rush. \n\nwhen you \"complete\" an NPC (get all hints), it just feels useless and empty (unless you want to kill everybody for fun and be overpowered).\n\n3. the upgrade / progession / RPG system\n\nfirst thing that really tells you the quality of the game is the upgrade screen ([https://www.primagames.com/games/vampyr/tips/vampyr\\-how\\-unlock\\-and\\-upgrade\\-skills](https://www.primagames.com/games/vampyr/tips/vampyr-how-unlock-and-upgrade-skills)) . the skills are not even organized in a creative or logical or usefull manner, they just plastered the skills all over the screen and barely regrouped them in a seemingly logical way.\n\n(one of the skill, healing, is just laying there, in the middle of the screen, i guess they didnt know where to put it, knowing they kept the HUGE ugly head of your character in the middle of the screen...why ?)\n\nbut, first, the icons are just UGLY. that's one. and then when you click on one of the 18 skills, you realize there is a sub menu, with a sub tree.... yes.... when you get the BITE skill, you get to improve it 12 times, to get 5&amp;#37;, 10&amp;#37;, 15&amp;#37;.... etc bonus... how modern and interesting it is for the player to chase the same skill upgrade 10 times .\n\nalso, another great design choice, all the skills are open and visible to the player right from the start (while you are supposed to be a very new vampire who is lost to all that), so much for discovery and mystery.\n\nanyway, the game, i am sorry is bad, no, not bad, because some aspects of it are interesting, but there so much low\\-quality aspects to it, and the designers seem to be just clueless to what makes good mechanics, especially in terms of quests and dialogs.\n\nso many things are just weird, you can steal and loot cabinets in front of NPCs they don't react, all the game takes place during the night (i can accept it , i am a vampire), but all the NPCs are up at night, EVERY night, for no reasons (even SHOPKEEPERS), ... i dont know ... the game seem broken and just bizarre.\n\nsadly, it seems that all the makers of the game have is the technical skill (programming) to make it.... which is the most important :)\n\nsorry for the rant, but this sub often feels that gameplay mechanics are important, it's good sometimes to notice how things can go wrong.",

        "text": "I'm 35.  I'm old enough to remember the launch of Morrowind.  I played Oblivion on day one.  Between 2009 and 2011 I read *everything* there was to read about the development of Skyrim.  I distinctly remember how important it was that Skyrim's NPCs behaved in a realistic fashion.  Todd Howard discussed the *Radiant* system with many outlets, and really made it a keystone of Skyrim's development.\n\n\nWe all laugh and joke about Skyrim's NPCs.  They repeat ridiculous lines, chase dragons with iron daggers, murder you for harming their chicken, etc.\n\n\nHowever, the truth is that these things only stick out like a sore thumb because of how sophisticated the NPCs really were.  Compare the behavior of Skyrim's NPCs to almost anything else in the genre.  Even now, after nearly 7 years it still beats most games.\n\n\nAnyway... in a 2016 interview Todd Howard said this regarding TES:VI:\n\n\n&gt; *\"I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, ‘That sounds like you don’t even have the technology–how long is that going to take?’ And so it is something that is going to take a lot of time what we have in mind for that game.\"*\n\n\nTo me this says that Todd Howard isn't talking about graphics or world building tools.  We already have the technology to make ridiculously beautiful games, we can make gigantic worlds with no problem as well.  I think the *technology* that Todd Howard was referring to was this:\n\n\n- **Advanced AI.**  Not just the kind of AI that's used for pathfinding and decision making.  We already have that in games.  More on this below.\n\n\n- **Voice recognition.**  Believe it or not, the joke announcement of the *Skyrim: Very Special Edition* on the Amazon Alexa is actually real!  Yes, on the outside this looks like Bethesda is merely playing with their fans.  However, I think it's a genuine by product of something they've been testing out.  I predict that in TES:VI you will be able to walk up to an NPC and *actually say something to them*.  I think the fidelity of the voice recognition will be on-par with the recent *Google Assistant* tech demo.\n\n\n- **Procedural speech generation.**  This is the hard part.  We all know that voice recognition has gotten extremely sophisticated, but Siri, Alexa, and others still sound robotic and fake.  I believe that by TES:VIs release this final keystone will be in place.  The NPCs will be able to respond to you procedurally, and in a realistic way.  Again, look at the *Google Assistant* tech demo to see what I'm talking about.\n\n\nThis is actually something I've been talking about on Reddit for over *FIVE YEARS!*  Below are a couple of links to those conversations:\n\n- [**Is Voice Recognition the Future of NPC interaction?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1f85jg/is_voice_recognition_the_future_of_npc_interaction/)\n\n- [**Speech recognition, and procedurally generated voices. Where is the technology right now? Is it headed to games? And most importantly, do gamers even want it?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/4q87py/speech_recognition_and_procedurally_generated/)\n\nSo, if you're interested, check out those threads.  There was some really good discussions in the comments... much of which was shooting my ideas down, but I respect people's input!\n\n\nBack to the AI thing.\n\nNow, you may be thinking to yourself: *\"This guy thinks something as sophisticated as Google Assistant will be in games?  Sounds pretty far fetched!\"*\n\n\nThe game AI would be much more limited in scope.  It only has to carry out the illusion so to speak.  While Google Assistant has to deal with almost any question, and deal with almost any response (in addition to being able to look up almost anything in the world, such as online menus for every restaurant in Hong Kong), a system like this in game would be more restrictive.\n\nEach NPC would have limited access to some kind of in-game encyclopedia.  Lets say you ask a farmer about where to find a certain Deadric artifact.  You literally say into a microphone, *\"Hi, I'm looking for a sword called Dawnbreaker.\"*  The AI runs a check.  Does the NPC have access to that information?  No.  Does the NPC know who does?  Yes.  The system generates a response.  *\"I'm sorry traveler I know of no such thing.  Perhaps you could ask someone at the Mage's Guild.\"*  This will all happen in a matter of seconds.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n\nHave your opinions on voice recognition and procedurally generated speech changed over the last five years?\n\n\nIf this was a feature in an RPG such as TES:VI would you use it?\n\n\nDo you think I'm wildly incorrect about Todd Howard's missing technology?\n\n\nLet me know!\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n- I completely agree that the system should be optional.\n\n- I think it would only seem awkward the first few times you use it... *AND* if it wasn't implemented well.\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\n- *Of course they shouldn't implement it if it doesn't work well!*  To the people comparing it to customer service line... that isn't even close to the fidelity I think we'll hit in the next few years.  Once again, check out the *Google Assistant* tech demo. Here's a [**link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmCeI_3ehMo).",

For everything right that Deus Ex gets, I think they could do better with their anti-aug characters by making them more morally grey/understandable.",

        "text": "I first saw the trailer for Battlefield 5 almost immediately after it was released, and like many others, I was kinda miffed. I have a certain idea of how the Battlefield series generally plays and looks in my head, and this seemed to go completely against that. The colours, the prosthetic arm, the loud English lady, it all seemed so goofy. Well, hey, shit happens. it’s just 1 trailer, maybe I might still enjoy the game when it comes out. What I did not really expect was the clown fiesta that followed. People weren’t just annoyed, they were outraged. I was taken aback by the level of vitriol and sometimes straight up sexist comments that were getting hugely upvoted in the comments section. The hundreds of Youtubers ‘reacting’ to the trailer just fuelled the fire further. \n\n\nVideos like these started popping up all over my recommended feeds (honestly, there are hundreds of them I could’ve included): \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSp2evlsQI8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qGQCnGq28Y\n\n\n\n\nAfter watching some of these something really started to bother me, but I couldn’t quite figure it out. I then found a video that went against this common narrative and makes some points that shed a different light on all this: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl5330RvVbM\n\nThis video sorta cleared up what was bothering me. It was the common thread of people complaining about political agendas. What I realised was that a lot of people weren’t just mad about certain design choices of the game, or even about the lack of realism.  People were getting personally offended about some perceived ‘agendas’. \n\nThis sort of got me thinking about representation in video games as well. Are we now in some sort of catch-22 situation where if a woman or minority plays a prominent role in a video game, that there will be accusations of it being shoehorned in as part of some agenda, while at the same time there are gonna be people crying out for greater representation/diversity when these characters are not present? It has kinda happened with the new gears of war trailer too - hell there’s a thread on /r/livestreamfail titled ‘gears of feminism’ right now: https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/8q46uc/gears_of_feminism/\n\nDo you feel like BF5 were unnecessarily stuffing women into a WW2 setting, or is it just not a big deal that the devs made female character models an option for multiplayer? I wanted a realistic game too, but the fact that I didn’t get quite so mad makes me think that the motivation behind this outcry goes beyond just some idea of achieving realism in video games. \n",

        "author": "bandit7319",

        "text": "This isn't a thread asking which to get!  More a thread to just kind of share my recent experiences and see peoples' thoughts. It's a bit of a read, but mayhaps you'll find it enjoyable and have comments.\n\nI started a post titled \"Video Games Then and Now\" and got some conversation on it, and Switch and the 3DS were mentioned as possibly appealing to me more than the games for the main systems. Here was my thought process...\n\nSwitch\n\n1. New system, lots of life left in it\n2. Positive reaction it seems\n3. Mobile mode\n4. Nintendo system \n\nSo, I was thinking I would go buy it.  I'm looking for something that would be more appealing to very casual gamers like myself.  I don't really have much time to play video games in my preferred big screen TV/surround sound mode anymore, but I still want to get my game fix.  That's why I figured the Switch could be a good purchase for me.  It CAN connect to the TV, but it also has the mobile mode. I went to Best Buy to test it out and they had the Mario game on demo and set up with the controllers being in both separate and connected modes (I dunno the name, but it's where the are controllers connected in a frame so it's more like a standard gamepad). My first reaction was, holy shit, these buttons are tiny. My hands swallowed the controllers. I'm not fat, but am generally big at 6'1. I goofed around in the game for a few minutes. It looked good, played pretty well from what I can tell, and seemed fun. But as I looked around at everything going on in the environment, I remembered that I'd probably primarily be playing in mobile mode. Unfortunately they didn't have a demo of that set up, but I looked it up and was hoping for at least a 10\" screen, but was disappointed to see that it was only 6.2 inches. I knew the screen in my car was similar to that (6.1\"), so I tried to imagine what it would be like playing these games on a small screen, and then I kinda had a moment where I realized that the Switch, while it had a mobile mode, likely had games developed on it with intentions of being played on a real TV. I thought about games like Diablo 3, which is one of my favorite games, shrunk down to the 6.2 inch screen and realized I likely wouldn't be able to see shit. Then I looked over the games and the only ones I was really interested in were Zelda, Mario, DKC, and Mario Kart.  I got to thinking, the console is 300, each game is 60, so I'd be spending almost $600 after taxes and would only be able to really play maybe an hour or so of games a day, if even that, and they were games that I thought would be fun but wasn't EXCITED about per se... and decided not to do it. \n\nSo I thought I was finished, and was just moping about feeling sorry for myself for having to start giving up my gaming life in exchange for real life. No offense to my wife and kid.. but games have always been a fun way for me to unwind and relax, and since my daughter was born, I've gotten to play maybe 2 hours worth of games in 2 and a half months since my wife doesn't want to watch me play games (who does?) and I don't want to have to separate myself from them just so I can play some games. But then I had a revelation! There's the 3DS, a handheld system, a Nintendo system, and has a huge library of games between the 3DS and original DS (didn't know about the backwards compatibility until a guy at Gamestop told me, so happy he did. )\n\nI went to the local Gamestop and they had one, XL, just traded in, the color I liked, and was only $125. Woohoo! I looked at the games and all my favorites were available in some (and sometimes multiple!) forms \\- Animal Crossing, Zelda, Mario, Donkey Kong Country, Metroid.. and the games were 15\\-30 each! Another WOOHOO! I jumped on it. I got it about 2 weeks ago, and within a week I'd gotten the following:\n\n* Mario 3D World\n* Link Between Worlds\n* DKC Returns 3D\n* Rhythm Heaven Megamix (I love rhythm and music games)\n* Radio Hammer (another music game!)\n* Mario Kart 7\n* Monster Hunter Generations (a coworker has been telling me that I should get MHW, but since I wasn't THAT interested in it after watching and reading lots about it, I was hesitant.. but here was a chance to try it for $20!)\n\nI've been having a BLAST with it!  After finding out about the backwards compatibility, I did a search for all my favorite franchises to see if there were any versions of it for 3/DS, and sure enough, I found Phantasy Star 0. Phantasy Star Online was the game that introduced me to the wonderful world of loot and legendary weapons.... and kinda ruined other games for me lol. It's why if a game isn't a classic retro fun game or doesn't have a badass selection of unique, awesome weapons and characters, I'm not interested. I've also recently bought Mario Maker, which gives me an unlimited assortment of side scrolling Mario games, including ones I make!  And I've gotten all that for the price of the Switch Console on it's own.\n\nThe 3DS was definitely the best purchase I could've made. So, in conclusion, for those who want to continue playing their games despite all the adulting we have to do, or if you're feeling like video games have gone off in a direction you don't care for, I'd highly recommend getting a 3DS. Or even a 2DS! The games have the charm of all the games I loved growing up, simple fun (or you could get the more deeper ones if you're into that), can be played in bite\\-size pieces, is relatively cheap, AND you don't have to give up family time. Woohoo! The only bad thing is that I was told it was the new 3DS, but found it it wasn't when I went to download SNES VC games... but if you get an actual \"New 3DS\", you'll have all the SNES games in Virtual Console available. \n\nTo all those TL;DRs I'm sure I'll get \\- whatevs. For those that read, thanks!

        "text": "Before I go on, I should make it clear I didn't get too terribly far in Witcher 3. As much as I loved some of the side quests I did (a standout was the one where the king's still born baby was haunting his family) it felt like all the side content happened in a bubble independent of the world around it, like a one and done episode of a TV show. I can clearly see CD Project Reds prowess at writing quests, so I figure I should play some of their older games to see if this is a trend for them. \n\nCyberpunk 2077 has me interested, but I'm worried it'll suffer from that same problem of quest independence. Basically, I'm asking if Witcher 3 improves upon that as you get farther along, and if CD Projekts earlier games have that issue too. My favorite RPGs are Fallout New Vegas, Planescape Torment, and Fallout 2, and I largely credit that to most of the side content playing into the main story, or the games themes.\n\nThoughts and counterpoints are welcome :)",

Why is the idea of a Mad Max style, Rusted, dead, wasteland slowly being phased out of games in favor of forest environments.  It seems apocalypse in games changed at some point from wastelands like the desolate world of the older Fallouts or the frozen hellscape presented in Metro 2033 to a nature taking over theme.  Which I just never really liked.  It doenst scream post-apocalypse to me.  It more realistic in some cases but ultimately feels less hopeless and mysterious. Which in my opinion lessens that feeling you get when you see humanity getting by and living on and in some cases like fallout 4 just makes the people in the world look kinda stupid as in 200 years despite the seeming lack of radiation in many areas, lush trees and farmable soil they haven't developed majorly at all.",
