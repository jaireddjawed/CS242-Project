        "text": "[I was recently tasked with refactoring](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/5qjy15/hired_to_refactor_an_old_code_base/) a code base which defies all logic. I've decided to document the worst highlights of the process to share for your amusement.\n\nAs a little bit of background, I'm going to come up with a few pseudonyms for the people involved. The primary culprit responsible for the code, which was written around 10-15 years ago, is a fellow we'll call Jimmy. The languages of choice are Windows CLI (MS-DOS) and Anchor, which is a closed source pay-to-play language with only a couple hundred (optimistic estimate) developers in the business. Before I dive into it, let me quickly describe Anchor.\n\nThe first thing to know is that it contains a wide range of \"DoAlls\" which are essentially a class that has been compiled into executable format. You can overload a DoAll with arguments via windows CLI, and point it to a fixed-width data file. It will pipe all of that data in, make *exactly one* change, and then pipe it back out. Now I'm not saying that it's a bad language, in fact it's quite fast and powerful. The only problem is that it would require a meaningful architecture.\n\nAnchor's redeeming factor is that the code is predefined. You only have a few hundred classes to work with, and you can not write your own classes. You can write code in other languages which will dynamically generate Anchor code for you. This is ease of automation, thanks to the static language based on simple byte math. It was designed specifically for my industry.\n\nLet's all take a look at a basic Anchor script, so you have a better idea what I'm looking at. I apologize ahead of time for the length, and I've done my best to comment it as far as I understand it.\n\n**Note**: Feel free to skip the code mess.\n\n    /* This section describes the location of the file,\n\t   the fixed-width size of the data,\n\t   the size of the data which is rejected,\n\t   and the size of the final output data.\n           DAT = fixed width, RJT = rejected, RFM = reformatted.\n\t*/ \n\t;[FILE INFORMATION]\n    ;INPUT FILE=C:\\PROGRAM\\%CLIENT%\\%FILE%.DAT\n    ;INPUT RECORD SIZE=319\n    ;REJECTED FILE=C:\\PROGRAM\\%CLIENT%\\%FILE%_HEADER.RJT\n    ;REJECTED RECORD SIZE=319\n    ;SELECTED FILE=C:\\PROGRAM\\%CLIENT%\\%FILE%.RFM\n    ;SELECTED RECORD SIZE=1800\n    \n\t// Allocate 4000 bytes in memory to work with.\n    ;[CONTROLS]\n    WORKAREA 4000\n    \n\t// Copy all of the current data from byte 1-2000 into byte 2001-4000 for editing.\n    ;[DOALLS ROUTINES]\n    ;*** COPIES RECORD INFORMATION TO HOLDING AREA ***\n    MOVES\n    R 0001-2000;2001-4000\n    \n\t// Clear out the first 2000 bytes so that new data can be moved into them.\n    ;*** CLEARS STANDARD RECORD AREA ***\n    REFORMAT\n    R 0000-0000;0001-2000\n    R 2001-4000;2001-4000\n    \n\t// Move data from the last 2000 bytes into the first 2000 bytes in specific orders.\n\t// Format is R - starting bytes, ending bytes (move to) starting bytes, ending bytes.\n    ;*** BRINGS INFORMATION BACK - IN ENGAGE LAYOUT ***\n    MOVES\n    R 2001-2009;0051-0075                  Finder Number \n    R 2290-2309;0076-0100                  Keycode\n    R 2030-2049;0101-0150                  Title\n    R 2050-2069;0151-0200                  First Name\n    R 0000-0000;0201-0250                  Middle Name\n    R 2070-2099;0251-0300                  Last Name\n    \n\t// Generate the number 1 in byte 1301.\n    ;*** SET APPEAL TO 1 AS DEFAULT ***\n    GENERATE CONSTANT IN POSITION 1301 THRU 1301 1\n    \n\t// Test if the letter A exists in byte 2009, and place letter X in byte 3001 if true.\n    ;*** CREATE TABLE TO TEST FOR A LETTER IN POSITION 2009 ***\n    CHANGE ACCORDING TO TABLE1 IN POSITION 2009 THRU 2009 3001 THRU 3001\n    T1 A;X\n    \n\t// Generate a letter X in byte 3002, so that you can compare byte 3001 to it later.\n\t// Generate a null in byte 3003, so that you can compare later.\n    ;*** GENERATE A TEST VARIABLE FOR IF STATEMENT ***\n    GENERATE CONSTANT IN POSITION 3002 THRU 3002 X\n    GENERATE CONSTANT IN POSITION 3003 THRU 3003\n    \n\t// MDUS111 = IF/THEN statement.

They're managed by ~~hundreds~~ [**thousands** of Windows batch files](http://imgur.com/HWnU48y.png) mixed with strange data containers.\n\nHe invented many interesting file formats. I've made my best guess at them, and a gold star to anyone who can decipher the other names:\n\n    .ALT = ??\n    .DAT = Data?\n    .SRT = Sort?\n    .BAD = Bad?\n    .DUP = Duplicates?\n    .LYT = Layout?\n    .prj = Project?\n    .RPT = Report?\n    .CVT = Convert?\n    .TMP = Temp?\n    .DA1 = ?\n    .DA2 = ?\n    .TX1 = ?\n    .NET = ?\n    .NE1 = ?\n    .MLC = ?\n    .FIN = ?\n    .FIL = ?\n    .LST = ?\n    .CNT = ?\n\nAs you can see, Jimmy was not only a visionary in our field of programming, but truly ahead of his time. He reminds me of [Master Foo and the Programming Prodigy](http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/prodigy.html), although he never met Master Foo to learn this Koan. To date, I have found maybe a dozen comments from him, and not a shred of documentation. I often wonder what he looks like, where he is in life, and whether he thinks about the *beautiful* creation he left behind. Surely he must have known that one day I'd be picking up where he left off.\n\nFunny thing is, there are often rumors that he screwed with the code before he left. I don't believe that, as it's often better to assume foolishness over malice. The likely scenario is that nobody even knew how the software worked, and it was so deeply obfuscated that it appeared intentionally broken. After working with this code for a year now, I can say it doesn't seem malicious... but I may be a hopeless optimist.\n\nI'll continue to document these strange behaviors and scripts that I find. The horrors contained within have slowly eaten up my motivation and sanity over the past year. **The code has already been refactored** to an acceptable working state in C#/.NET with Redpoint, but I'm still going back to find all of the missing pieces as time goes on.\n\nAs a final treat, here's the script I found which restarts the primary script control script if something goes wrong. How does it work? By deleting hundreds of files... Look through at the beautiful names.\n\nDEL J:\\%JOBNUM%\\COUNT_DOUBLES.TXT\n\nDEL J:\\%JOBNUM%\\Double_Count.txt\n\nDEL J:\\%JOBNUM%\\HOUSE_DOUBLES.DAT\n\nDEL J:\\%JOBNUM%\\HOUSE_DOUBLES.DA1\n\nDEL J:\\%JOBNUM%\\DOUBLE_REJECTS.DAT\n\nEtc...\n\nFull List: http://pastebin.com/5npYx2aj\n\n\n",

I knew that Javascript was... \"flexible\"... but this...\n\nWe have a form for the user to enter some data. Now, in one of the fields a pure number is not valid, and there is a client-side check for that. However, it would be perfectly valid to enter something like \"456Hello\". The way the script checks whether it's a number is to try `parseFloat(string)` on it, and see if it returns something that's a number.\n\nFor some reason, one of the entries with that kind of pattern was failing, and I couldn't figure out why. I couldn't see anything odd on the debugger, so I started looking up function documentation. And that's where I find the language specification for [parseFloat(string)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-parsefloat-string), complete with this little note:\n\n&gt;**parseFloat** may interpret only a leading portion of string as a Number value; it ignores any code units that cannot be interpreted as part of the notation of an decimal literal, and no indication is given that any such code units were ignored.\n\nWhat.",

But instead they decided to get away from `Optional` as quickly as they could, because I guess monads are scary.\n\n---\n\nBONUS: Elsewhere in the same class, we have this:\n\n    for (Foo foo : this.foos) {\n        if (foo.hasBar(bar)) {\n            // 100 lines of nested if statements\n        }\n    }\n\n... completely ignoring the existence of the getFooFromBar method.",

        "text": "**TL;DR**  \nA guy thought it was a good idea to disable validation by overriding the framework\n\n    protected function registerValidationResolverHook()\n    {\n        // no-op\n    }\n\n---\n\nAlright, so this is not the worst code I've encountered, but it is one of the most stupid decisions I've seen made. As a note, this is a PHP project on the Laravel MVC framework. That framework has something called \"form request validation\" built-in. It essentially allows you to perform validation as a request is being injected into a controller method, before it hits any of your controller code. Now, this is super useful, it means the controller doesn't get cluttered with validation.\n\nHowever, in this particular project, several devs have been wondering why the hell validation hasn't been working, and have taken the easy way out... So last week, our code would look something like this:\n\n    public function store(CreateProductRequest $request)\n    {\n        return response()-&gt;json($this-&gt;productService-&gt;createProduct($request), 201);\n    }\n\nAnd the `ProductService`'s method would then call `$request-&gt;validate()`.\n\nThere are two issues with this code:\n\n* A service should not deal with a request, it should just deal with the data it needs, not be checking if things exist in the request... We're not writing procedural code for Christ's sake.\n* `$request-&gt;validate()`, come on now. The framework is supposed to handle it.\n\nBeing my normal optimistic self, I figured \"hey, this can't be too difficult\". So I started off in a sane way - I followed the request throughout the framework, from class to class, I found the part where DI happens to the controller method... But there was nothing about validation! After a bit more scouring, I found the `ValidationServiceProvider`. It turns out, this class, part of the framework, registers a post-injection hook, which is called by the framework after injecting the class, but before responsibility is handed over to the controller method.\n\nHowever, I couldn't figure out why the code was being called... So I created a new Laravel project, inserted a `die()` in the `ValidationServiceProvider` method. Sure enough, it got there. I was dumbstruck; how did it work in one project but not the other. That's when it occurred to me: what if we have our own service provider, one that overrides the framework's.\n\nOf course we did. Now, at the time of checking this, there were quite a few things in there, custom validation rules and such. However, doing a `git blame` and checking the commit hash, I found out the provider was originally created with one purpose: to **disable** validation. There is no *reason* it has been disabled, at all.\n\n    protected function registerValidationResolverHook()\n    {\n        // no-op\n    }\n\nThat's right. The code was overwritten to change a protected method being called, to prevent validation.\n\nNow, for two full days, I've been refactoring this project, and while some of it was refactoring a service too large, I have a total of 42 changed files, where the only changes I've made are\n\n1. Remove `$request-&gt;validate()`\n2. Remove services' dependencies on requests, and actually pass through the data they need\n\nI have more than 40 failing tests and I still have 12 requests left to go through (out of around 45).\n\nAnd now, it's time to go back and handle the rest, and then refactor the tests.",

Some PHP here and there for the backend functions, but basically JavaScript.\n\nBut something always bothered me about the jslib in my IDE. Namely all the red lines. So, with some breathing room, I decide it's time to see this site in all her bare beauty.\n\nI have since seen the face of God, cried havoc and let lose the bugs of war and generally pushed our WTFs p/m through the roof.\n\n\"But why, /u/Smokey_Circles, JavaScript is a decent language and it's hard to butcher it!\"\n\nI'd agree, if it wasn't for this\n\n    #extern requirments\n    #require main.js\n\nHmm... Those aren't JS tags... Maybe something went **very** wrong in my import? They're not there in the live source code... I have a bad feeling about this.\n\nStrip these weird tags and reload the page. FUCKED. Great... \n\n3 days later, and I stumble upon the most re-invented of wheels: A C app that gets called by a php loader. This app returns a compiled JS file. Of roughly 40k lines (shit you not). \n\nThis dude **wrote his own goddamned interpreter**. \n\nNot one CSS file anywhere in this project. Everything is pretty much handled by this damned interpreter.\n\nNow, while I am impressed that he bent JS to his will, my only question is WHYYYYY. JS did not need your fancy interpreter, it's just fine. Also HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE DOM OR OF CSS!?!?!?! \n\nPlease send help. It's been 2 months and all I have managed to understand is the limit of my own sanity\n\n**EDIT: Oh yeah, did I mention it wasn't version controlled?",

The only problem is that he's quite impatient.\n\nLast time I saw that he made 121 commits to the project. I was away for a week, so it wasn't strange at first. Then I realized, that each commit has the name \"Upgraded networking\". Also, he commited all 121 in under an hour. In an hour... I let that sink in for a moment...\n\nI thought in myself: he either had a coding spree on the same part of the code (the networking part is just 1 class), or he recommited the same thing 50 times (somehow). No no no... I was very wrong.\n\nTo do things \"efficiently\", he commits everything he has done when he compiles the program. This isn't a big thing, it can take sometimes a long time.\n\nBut because he commits everything when the compiling runs, there are always small mistakes/errors in the code. 98 out of those 121 commits are bug fixes (he only changed maximum 1 or 2 lines, or sometimes only 1 character). There are only 3 useful commits, the other changed a few lines, but I wouldn't qualify them as useful.\n\nThis whole thing happened 3 times thus far (although in smaller scales).\n\nNow I need to scroll in the project to see actual useful commits.
