        "text": "This rant has somehow become very long. Must be pointed out I was obviously I was really keen to get in on the North Face coat and skin fade trend... but anyway...\n\nI purchased a coat last weekend from a North Face store. It is a fairly bog standard polyester coat. When I got it home I hung it up and my wife proceeded to put her slightly damp coat on top. When I looked at it the next day it was clear the coat had changed colour to a reddish colour where it had come into contact with the water and that the marks caused by the water will not go away. I put a slight bit of water on it from my tap to which the dye again ran and the coat turned a reddish colour. \n\nUpon trying to return it today four employees argued this was to be expected as their polyester coats are not officially waterproof. They said I had clearly incorrectly washed it, something I politely pointed out could not be the case as it had a none soggy cardboard pricing label still on it. They then stated this 'should not be warn in rain' (I promise I am not paraphrasing or twisting their words they genuinely said this). They said I should have known this from the detailing on the sleeves?!?! They said all customers in the store would know that a jacket of this type was to not be warn in the rain to which I found this ludicrous. I showed them the website where the listing for this coat says that its ‘synthetic insulation maintains warmth even in damp conditions.’. They again argued this was proof it could not be used in wet conditions as it only says ‘damp’. The manager did come out and reiterate the same thing and then vanished when challenged saying it was a ‘grey area’ as they had not gone home with me and the coat to see if I’d done something dodgy to the coat. The manager tried arguing I could not return it because two weeks had gone by, I then pointed out the return policy was thirty days and due to February only having 28 days that I was within the two week she had just stated. The manager got flustered at this and said she had an appraisal to carry out leaving it to the teenage weekend workers to try and work out a solution. \n\nThe girl behind the checkout then became irate and again iterated it was totally normal for this to happen to their products in rainy conditions. I asked the chap next to me who was paying if he would expect he could wear said coat in the rain to which he replied 'duh it's an outside coat'... or words to that effect. I hate any sort of confrontation so was calm in doing this and at no point did I raise my voice, my wife was with me and was also trying to state how ridiculous their argument was. All I wanted was a quick and painless refund with little confrontation. However, upon asking the chap next to me his opinion the staff in store without my knowing got security as I was ‘involving other customers’, to which I left as I did not like the idea of looking a Karen. \n\nPlease can someone please confirm I am not mad for expecting this coat not to change colour permanently when it gets the slightest bit wet? The employees made me feel like a proper... how do we put this... melt and although I know it is ridiculous I am wondering if I am somehow the a\\*\\*hole in this situation. I feel bad because I always find it unfair that customer facing teens who are probably paid a minimal amount are expected to deal with issues such as the one I was having… but I also did find it irritating how they argued ‘I had not had the training of North Face materials’ so could not comment upon whether said coat should stain in rain water or not. Surely common sense dictates the coat is faulty!\n\nLink of me putting tap water onto the coat:  [https://imgur.com/a/df7RjU0](https://imgur.com/a/df7RjU0)",

Wanting to get round him before I was on his tail, I made moves to start pulling out. I decided against such an action as there was a car in the nearside lane attempting to stop me by matching my speed (65/70), actively slowing and speeding up to block me. That isn't what confused me, people can be dicks, what got me was that it looked like it was indicating in... with a solid orange light in the wing mirror. Now, there's some odd indicators and headlight styles going about, so I didn't think much of it. Said car made no movement to indicate they were pulling in, carrying on as 'normal', again nothing to write home about. The light didn't flash, and I couldn't make out if it was just a shit indicator or some reflection, so went on my way and forgot about it.\n\nJust seen another one in the light today... they have orange lights actually in the mirrors?! Who's smart idea was that?? Are they warning lights? They look like indicators on first glance when youre behind/next to the car! I wish I could remember the type of car, but I was concentrating on driving.",
