I'll be 65 by then, and I imagine I'll be well off, but I'd love to live for as long as possible and keep working for as long as I can.\n\nI do know that there's been some recent breakthroughs in reducing, or even outright preventing the onset of Alzheimer's and restorative care to preserve an older person's memory. I'm figuring that, if such developments bear fruit, we can keep the brain healthy for ever greater lengths of time as the decades pass. So there is some hope, at least with regards to the mental side of things.\n\nWhat do you think? Any chance we see real developments in the field of life extension and anti-aging?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/yv2h3b/will_diminishing_returns_prevent_the_singularity/",
        "text": "so, in regards to the singularity usually some form of intelligence explosion is postulated, where a sentient being (Usually postulated to be an AGI) will figure out how to increase it's inteligence, with this increased inteligence figureing out how to make itself in turn even more inteligent even faster and so on, until it's so vastely more inteligent than humans, that humans can not even start to grasp it's mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo express this inteligence explosion mathematically: let's take 1 IU (inteligence unit) being, which uses 1 TWU (thought-work unit) to increase it's inteligence to 2 IU, needing a duration of 1 TU (time unit) to acomplish that thought work. The inteligence-explosion hypothesis would then suggest, that to then increase it's inteligence from 2 IU to 4 IU it would also take 1 TWU, needing 0,5 TU to acomplish, i.e. only half as long as previous. This then applies to the further doubelings from 4 IU to 8 IU and 8 IU to 16 IU with 0,25 TU and 0,125 TU as well. So, the requiered time for each step of inteligence increase drops exponentially, while the entity get's exponentially more and more inteligent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, let's question this presumed stability of thought work. What if, for the second doubeling step from 2 IU to 4 IU the requiered thoughtwork isn't 1 TWU but 4 TWU, so the second doubeling would take 2 TU, not 0,5 TU as before. The third doubeling (from 4 IU to 8 IU) would then (presuming that the requiered thoughtwork would go from 4 TWU to 16 TWU) 4 TU and so on, with the time scales for each step of inteligence increase increasing exponentially. This is not an unreasonable expectation, as it is easier to improve a simple system than it is to improve a complex system, thus diminishing returns would make it increasingly less rewarding to invest thoughtwork into further inteligence enhancement, rather than actually use the gained inteligence to acomplish more rewarding tasks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, just because the singularity doesn't happen, doesn't mean transhumanism or inteligence enhancement isn't going to happen. Since there are uses for enhanced inteligence beyoind further enhancement, there is still a point in investing thoughtwork into enhancing inteligence. If the increase in thoughtwork for each iterative imrpovement isn't to steep, I could easily see something comparable to moore's law, where, for some period, there is the expectation of a certain improvement in inteligence amplification in a certain time period (until the returns diminish to far), putting a human upgraded such well into a transhuman area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I admitt, what I just said is utterly unfalsifiable as things stand now. Until iterative inteligence enhancement is attempted, we can't know, how the requiered thoughtwork for each improvement scales with the amount of improvement. So, once iterative inteligence amplification takes place, either the singularity will happen near instantanously (if the thoutwork for each doubeling scales up to less than double for each doubeling - though if the scaling up is close to that level, the inteligence explosion might be slower than we think), or by it not happening due to mentioned factor the theory will be proven correct. But until than, nothing can be proven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso, what do you think? Will this keep the singularity from happening? Or do you think I'm wrong? And if so, why?",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I am a self-proclaimed chronically optimistic futurist with very radical views of the short- and long-term future.  \n\n\nSpecifically, I say this because of AI. I'm a firm believer that a benevolent AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will enter a recursive self-improvement cycle, rapidly achieving intelligence far beyond that which humans can comprehend: We can explain an abstract concept to a dog, but it will never understand. Its intelligence is simply too low. Us humans are not void of that limitation. As such, problems that we have consistently failed at cracking could seem like child's play to that ASI (Artificial Superintelligence), like Brain-computer interfaces.  \n\n\nFull-dive VR is where we hook our brain up to a computer, which in turn transmits a constant stream of sensory data - identical to what our meat peripherals would. As such, we will exist in a virtual world that's indistinguishable from reality. The limits of what is possible in that reality would be set by real-world computational power, which is already adequate for a bunch of shit as of today. Quite literally, this virtual world would be a real version of heaven, with everyone's perfect worlds being realized - even if your perfect world is imperfect.  \n\n\nNaturally, this raises the question of whether or not we would even still want to exist in the physical world. Everything, and I mean everything, is worse in real life. If we had benevolent AI, it could take care of our bodies 24/7, keeping us alive for however long we want (longevity escape velocity would undoubtedly have been reached), tending to our physical health.  \n\n\nNow yes, if you say it like that it does sound sad as fuck, but life exclusively in VR will be perfected perfection, can't stress that enough. No amount of bionic implants will be able to raise reality's bar higher than VR's - the only reason someone might want to stay in the real world would be because of just that: it being the only \"real\" world.  \n\n\nyou're here on r/transhumanism, have you thought about this possibility? Would you stay in the real world because of its authenticity? Do you think this scenario is simply not a possibility? Would love to hear your takes.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/ypq2im/would_it_be_ethical_to_create_sentient_beings/",
        "text": "Humans are biologically hardiwred to experience pleasure from certain things, for example eating good tasting food when hungry or having sex with a partner considered desireable. This has been programmed into the human genetic template by evolution making it favourable for an organism to have this kind of hardwiring due to incentivizing survival and reproduction. Generally speaking, while there are people who, for various reasons, decide not to take these pleasures when having the chance, the fact that this hardwiring exists is, generally speaking, not considered a bad thing. So, would it be ethical for humans to create sentient beings - whether we are talking about AGI, uplifted animals or entirely neogentic creations - that similariily experience pleasure from performing tasks humans find unpleasant (for example any of the jobs on this list [https://www.careeraddict.com/worst-jobs](https://www.careeraddict.com/worst-jobs) )? Let's explore that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsider ethics to be determined by maximizing human wellbeing (or, to be inclusive of the wellbeing of the created beings discussed, the wellbeing of sentient beings): by creating a sentient being that experiences pleasure from performing jobs humans generally find unpleasant, and letting the created doing the job, the human that would normally do the job would no longer feel the displeasure from doing so, while the created being would experience pleasure from doing the job. So overall, we would see a increase in human/sentient wellbeing. So, ethically speaking, it would be the right thing to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, part of \"wellbeing\" is also freedom. i.e. for example hat the choice of those people deciding against taking pleasure is respected. In this regard, there is not really a problem. Even if the created being does experience pleasure from doing the task it was created for, there is nothing stopping it from not doing the task, just as there is nothing inherently stopping a human from fasting. Thus, no ethical problem here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you agree? Do you think there are ethical problems with creating beings such that they experience pleasure doing the tasks humans don't want to that I overlooked? If so, what would those be?",

I’ve noticed that the vast majority of these people fall into one of these categories:\n\n&gt;Religious boomers who think that Transhumanism will usher in the anti-Christ\n\n&gt;Far-Right people who mistake Transhumanism for transgenderism \n\n&gt;Spiritualists who think that crystal healing is a valid form of medicine\n\n&gt;Qoomers who think that the WEF runs everything and that vaccines contain microchips\n\n&gt;Redditors (need I say more?). \n\nOf course there’s some good arguments against Transhumanism, no ideology is absolutely perfect. But the fact that most of its critics rode the short bus to school makes Transhumanism look good by proxy. If I’m asking anything, I guess it’s this: are there any good critics of Transhumanism who didn’t grow up on a diet of lead paint chips and glue?",

        "text": "Some contexts, I've read online that scientists are now experimenting with making circuits using actual human brain neurons. I don't think anyone would argue that a few neurons are alive (although I still find it off-putting), but what happens when we keep scaling it up? We'll reach a point where the neural circuits match or exceed human neuron size. Would it not be a human brain at that point? Now I personally don't believe ai to be sentient but when you start involving biological stuff it gets blurry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this seem unethical to make a neural circuit using human neurons and uploading an ai to it? Would you consider an ai uploaded to this to be sentient? Just because it isn't shaped like a human brain doesn't mean it wouldn't have the same capacities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's some unethical things I can see:\n\n1. The act of making neuron circuits to some set size in the first place. I doubt ten neurons would be considered sentient, but what about a quarter of the human brain or half? \n2. Imprinting information onto the brain would effectively allow you to make a cyborg do whatever you want. You could for example make them work and give you all the money and have them be okay with that.",

        "text": "We always hear of mergin mind(brain) and machine(computers), but in hindsight it's really just fancy talk for creating electro-mechanical enhancement to a biological brain.\n\nI am interested in a merging like the Jaeger pilots in the 2014 film *Pacific Rim*, which was really a three-part merger of two humans, coupled with Jaeger(machine). \n\nImagine we had seperate individuals, and we artificially grew/created a genetically-composite human body of the two seperate individuals, but it has no functioning brain. We then operate on the two individuals, taking a huge swarm of nanobots, that go into each individual's open cranium (they're being operated and under anesthesia), which systematically and methodically fine-tear the neurons and synapses of each brain, without causing damage. Then the nanobots transplant it into the genetic-composite that was artificially created with no brain.\n\nEach synapses and neurons of each individual is carefully connected to a opposing synapses and neurons of the other individual inside the cranium of the genetics composite. \n\nNow suppose that the nanobots are so precise and delicate that they can fill all the micro-cavities and empty space in the brain structure, that both individual's brains are 100% transplanted, versus transplanting the right-hemisphere of one individual coupled with the left-hemisphere of the other (I suppose the left over spheres of each individual would be cryogenically preserved in such a scenario).\n\nWould the composite-individual, operate cognitively like Tuvix from Star Trek and Vegito from Dragon Ball Z? Where the cognition would be a literal synergy of both minds, while displaying a unique personality?\n\nI recall in Dragon Ball Z, after the composite character split into the two original characters. One of them stated that it felt like a *dream*, as if he had conscious awareness of everything happening and recall, but felt as if it was someone else.\n\nOr would the composite-individual, be like a form of split personality. Where one Cognition goes to sleep, while the other takes over and they switch back and forth, or they're both awake simultaneously, with no controlling left side and the other the right side?\n\nAlso, assuming that they both speak English, but also a foreign language unique to the other. Would each personality (assuming it was maintained) be able to use the other's foreign language in speech, hearing, writing and comprehension?",
