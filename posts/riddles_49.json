To find out more information, you send in a spy with a wire to relay the challenge. Your plan goes smoothly, and the dictator presents the challenge: \n\nThere are 100 doors with a three digit passcode, 1 of which lead to freedom.  The other 99 lead to instant death. \n\n4 clues may be given among request, but any talking will result in instant execution. \n\nYour spy accepts the challenge and requests the first clue:\n\nThe product of the three digits of the passcode is 36.\n\nThe spy waits a few minutes, and requests the second clue:\n\nThe sum of the digits of the passcode is equal to the room number.\n\nA few more minutes pass until the spy asks for the third clue:\n\nThe digits of the passcode are in ascending order (second is greater than or equal to the first, and the third is greater than or equal to the second).\n\nAfter 20 minutes, the spy beckons for the final clue:\n\nThe last digit is unique to the others.\n\nThe spy only thinks for a few seconds before he heads to unlock a door.  You hear the squeaks as the door opens and the spy exclaims in happiness. However, as he talked, he is executed before he can relay anything to you.  What is the correct passcode and to which door?",

        "text": "So recently I read *In Evil Hour*, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It's a pretty good book, though not as good as his later stuff IMO. Anyway something I've been wondering about since I read it. At one point one of the characters presents 'an enigma', for someone else to solve. Here it is: as it appears in the book:\n\n&gt;He offered an enigma: a man registers at a hotel at ten at night, goes up to his room, and the next morning the waiter who brings him his coffee finds him dead and rotting in his bed. The autopsy shows that the guest who arrived the night before has been dead for a week.\n\n&gt;    The secretary sat up with a long creaking of joints.\n\n&gt; \"That means that when he got to the hotel he had already been dead for seven days,\" the secretary said.\n\n&gt;\"The story was written twelve years ago,\" Judge Arcadio said, ignoring the interruption, \"but the clue had been given by Heraclitus, five centuries before Christ.\"\n\nThe subject of the conversation then changes, and no one ever reveals the answer. Given the nature of the book it's possible no answer is intended, and that the riddle itself is there as a piece of symbolism, but if there is an answer I'd be interested in hearing it.",
