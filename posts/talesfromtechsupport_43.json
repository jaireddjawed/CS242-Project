Man today was a big headache and its only (at the time of posting tale) 1:35 PM EST.\n\nThis morning our LDAP server and the backup had a brain fart and caused a lot of people not being able to login to the intranet portal. luckily it was fixed at $company's main data center since the HDD for the server committed Sudoku and needed replacement. Nothing like a good old ipconfig /flushDNS to help with Intranet login issues. \n\nWith that server crashing, it also kicked people off of the company WiFi and into the guest WiFi since the machines couldn't authenticate themselves to the network which led to alot of I CAN'T CONNECT TO THE PRINTER issues. \n\nThank the IT gods the Ethernet was working at least so that people can print. Now excuse me while I sit in a corner with a case of 12 pack beers to drown the pain away :D\n\nTLDR: server and backup had a drive commit Sudoku that caused alot of things to stop working for a good bit. Its not even friday and I already want to drink this day away. ",

        "text": "Today's line-up:\n\n**$Burrito:** New-ish in her IT career. Her preference to burritos is ~~unknown~~ \"yes please\", and it fits well with her actual name.  \n**$BassGuitarist:** Very tech-knowledgeable, but he looks like his second job is being in a band.  \n**$LawnGnome:** Our newest hire to date. Contrary to his name he's actually quite tall and lengthy. His name is an inside joke for when I had to come up with a codename for him on the fly.  \n**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Is it the Holidays yet?**  \nSurprisingly, our work load has not been slowing down at all despite the holidays so everyone is kinda on the edge. We hired $LawnGnome out of school with the intent of being able to sit down with him and ease him into the work life. Well, with how busy we've been, the learning process can best be described as \"drinking from a fire hose\". So far so good though. No $Burrito-Breakdown-esque type of episodes, and he's picking up on things super quick!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLast week, a few of us decided to go out to lunch as a sort of mental escape from the office. However, our director has this rule that at least one team member has to stay in the office in case something breaks or the ~~red phone~~ Emergency Line goes off. It just so happened the folks who were left at the office were $LawnGnome, $Burrito, $BassGuitarist, and myself. $LawnGnome brings in his lunch so naturally we were inclined to have him man the phones. He normally spends his lunch breaks catching up on YouTube or just doing non-work things for an hour so this looked to be a perfect match!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** Hey, $LawnGnome, we're about to go to lunch. Could I have you cover the phones while we're gone?  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Uh, sure? What do I have to do?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** For the most part, nothing. We just need to have someone at the office in case the phone rings. The good news is that the phone almost **never** rings so it's more of a piece-of-mind thing for our director. If the phones do happen to ring, just pick up the line, fix it if you can or call me if I need to dispatch a field tech if an on-site is needed.  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Sounds easy enough.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Yeah, the big thing is just make sure that you don't go anywhere.  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Okie doke!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd with that the three of us going to lunch happily skip out of the office to make our way to the SavyMobile. We bump into a $ShipEx guy looking for our office suite and we point him in the right direction. Our office is questionable to find so this is a regular thing when it's not our usual delivery guy.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe make it all of 2 miles away from the office before I get a call from $LawnGnome.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Hey, so-  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Did the emergency line ring?!  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** No, it's just a $ShipEx guy. He needing to deliver some computers, and he doesn't know where to put them.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Just have him deliver it to our floor.  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Well, he said he has a whole pallet of computers.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Uh...have him hold on for a bit I need to call someone about that.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is the awkward part as the building manager has a strict no-pallet policy within the building so when we have pallets dropped off at the dock we just tear them down and place the contents on large carts to wheel them into the warehouse. This was Friday, the warehouse is closed on that day. I tried calling a couple of the warehouse folks to see if I could confirm whether we should have been expecting a delivery today, but all I got were deer-in-headlight looks.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** So...the warehouse is closed which means if the $ShipEx guy is dropping off a pallet you'll have to unload the whole thing by yourself until we can make it back.  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Okay....  \n&gt;**$Savy:** That, or you can ask the $ShipEx guy is he can come back on Monday when we can properly receive it.  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** I see I see, I'll talk to him.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe get back to the office and find that $ShipEx agreed to come back. The phones didn't ring, and nothing else caught on fire.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** Good job, you survived!  \n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Yep!....by the way, can I take my lunch now?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** *(looking at the time)* What?! You haven't eaten lunch??  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Did he starve to death?**  \nApparently, he took me at the most literally sense when I told him not to go anywhere; he stayed at his desk the whole time. He assumed that to mean not to go to the parking lot where he had left his lunch. My only question is, what in the world would he have done had he needed to go to the bathroom?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** I tempted fate, and fate won. Also, this makes the second employee I've almost killed via bad word choice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Formatting",

When I arrived they were all waiting for me, worried as hell because the computer was making \"horrible noises\" and they have been turning it on and off for the last 15 minutes (thank God my coworkers are not computer illiterate).

        "text": "**Background:**\n\nIn a previous life I was the primary support and training Engineer for a small company that produced a variety of portable satellite uplink terminals. In the end, our largest customer was a military public affairs program that allowed the public affairs troops in the field to directly engage with civilian media back state-side.\n\n**The Story**\n\nAs part of my job, I would usually take the support number over the Holidays. It was usually pretty quiet, and being \"On Call\" meant that I didn't have to use my vacation days when the office was closed between Christmas and New Years. I could be \"working\" while sitting on a ski hill, or whatever. However, I had one usual customer during this time.\n\nAs many of you may know, one of the things that NORAD out of Colorado is known for is their annual mission to track and escort Santa as he travels the world, delivering presents. As part of this mission, they setup interviews between the personnel at NORAD and civilian news agencies. This was done over the public affairs satellite system we had sold them.\n\nThe first year they called, it's early in the morning on December 24th, and they're just getting setup but can't find the satellite. I work through the diagnostics on their system, and everything looks good. I then walk them through aiming the dish, and pretty quickly they get a lock and everything is good. We patch in the satellite operator, and pretty soon they're up on the air, doing hit after hit with media organizations.\n\nA year later, it's pretty much the same thing, except that they actually failed to connect the coax cables between the indoor gear and the antenna, and of course they can't find the satellite. Again, I diagnose their system, get them to hook it up properly, and walk them through finding the satellite.\n\nTL;DR: I had to help NORAD find a stationary satellite, when the organization is tasked with detecting inbound bombers and warheads.",

        "text": "So, for a bit of a backstory, I work IT for a call center. We have campaigns that work for companies who contract us to take calls or chats for them. These companies usually provide broken software/webpages and rarely, if ever, tell us how to configure our systems to work with these programs/pages.\n\nAbout 6 months ago one of our clients make some pretty major changes to the way web traffic is routed on their back end. Our net admins spend weeks working with the client to make sure our systems are up to snuff. Time comes for the switch over (at 3am), our proxy server takes a shit, but we get things up and running. The next day we notice that some users are getting looped back to the login page when trying to access their customer contact platform. \n\nThis problem doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it. It only happens to a few random people, and seems to resolve itself no matter what you do. We come up with a few \"fixes\" that work sometimes. Eventually, after hundreds of man hours troubleshooting, we end up going back to our campus DNS servers instead of the ones set up specifically for this campaign. This resolves the issues and no one has any trouble.\n\nUntil we get an email from one manager a few weeks after the fix is in place. Her agent is having the looping issue again. Now, we've had reports of the looping issue since then, but it was always a manager calling some other issue the looping issue. At this time this agent is apparently the only person in the company having the issue. The big problem was that this agent came in after all techs had left for the day.\n\nWe mostly ignore this problem for a few weeks, because there's no way that the agent is still having this issue. I delete her Windows profile off of every conceivable system, and flushed the DNS while I was at it. I talked with my boss, our net admins, and the rest of my helpdesk team, and the general consensus was that either the manager was full of shit, or the agent was doing something to break it on purpose so they didn't have to work.\n\nEventually this reaches critical mass with some upper level execs CCed in emails, so I get to stay a few hours late to look at it. I walk into the room all smug, waiting to be able to tell everyone that they're wrong. The agent comes in, sits down, and logs in. Now, I've already deleted their profile off of this computer, so it's a clean slate.\n\nThe agent gets the looping issue. I run gpupdate, clear cache/cookies and have them try again. Still looping. I go delete their profile again. Still looping. Delete this user out of AD and recreate them. Still looping. At this point we've reached the conclusion that it's an issue with her account for the platform (which we don't control).\n\nLuckily I didn't voice my opinions on the matter to any of the sales team, because I would have looked like an ass. The moral of this long story is that no matter how stupid you think the user is, it really helps to actually see things in person before jumping to conclusions.",

Environment is translating from file to database, then database to file, and there is the occasional transaction that collides with another, locking up a table.  \n  \nToday, get a semi panic email that all processing is halted, a job that basically steps through all the document types and processes them, wasn't getting past purchase orders, just trying to update a status. Alert emails being broadcast to all customers, processing is halted, working on it, heat is on.  Check error logs, nothing, SQL is running, wtf.  Call in **$SQL** , he can't see anything wrong, so we kill the 1 step in the job and see if it resumes.  Hung again, same step.  Rinse and repeat killing the step 3 more times, and we're back to normal, wtf.  Now that the table isn't locked up I can query wtf is going on.  4 outbound orders, for a brand new destination, never been run before.  Hmmmmm.  Let's see how they ran in dev.  QUE?  Ehhh the transaction was never tested, ever, but made it's way to prod.  Groovy man.  \n  \nDive into development mode, **$OG** did the transaction and moved to production 5 months ago, never tested once. All the sql updates are hosed, detail records are trying to update header, etc, selects referencing wrong tables, good times.  Yadda yadda yadda 9 hours later we are humming along.  **$OG** is a good guy, but gets in over his head on some simple stuff sometimes, but not testing is a huge no no in this system.  \n\n",

        "text": "For the uninitiated, Hanlon's Razor (at least my interpretation thereof) states, 'Never immediately attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity'.\n\nThis is from my previous job - I started at the company as a SQL developer, and because of my love of tinkering, was moved to a newly-formed DevOps team. It was appallingly managed and the team disbanded shortly after I moved to a better job. Nonetheless, I used to be a regular Mac user (gave up around Mavericks, but I know my way around the UI and the command line).\n\nBackstory: the company made a SaaS product, and a mandate came down from Manglement to support Safari. One of the sales guys donated his old iMac to the company, so we had the hardware. It fell to the DevOps team to manage it because IT didn't want it (they were all Windows) and we had some experience. For the life of me, however, I could not get Active Directory authentication to work, so (as is relevant to the story), all accounts were local. The iMac was also set up on a desk in a different building to where I was sitting, so I had VNC set up.\n\nA QA guy ($QA) messages me on Lync asking for an account on the Mac. Helpfully, he also sits on the desk immediately beside it so he's able to message back. Since the QA team is big enough to justify individual accounts, I fire up VNC, log in as my admin user and start creating him an account. Since it's VNC, he can see exactly what I'm doing on the screen. This is my Lync transcript:\n\n&gt;[‎24/‎04/‎2017 10:58 AM] $me:  \n&gt;so on the iMac screen  \n&gt;tell you what, rather than me generating you a random password  \n&gt;want to enter a your own?  \n&gt;[‎24/‎04/‎2017 11:00 AM] $QA:  \n&gt;yup  \n&gt;is it unique to that machine and won't ever change?  \n&gt;[‎24/‎04/‎2017 11:00 AM] $me:  \n&gt;correct  \n[‎&gt;24/‎04/‎2017 11:01 AM] $QA:  \n&gt;ok what smart-ass inverted the mouse on it...  \n&gt;[‎24/‎04/‎2017 11:01 AM] $me:  \n&gt;is the Apple logo the right way up on the mouse?  \n&gt;[‎24/‎04/‎2017 11:01 AM] $QA:  \n&gt;oh wow...  \n&gt;(facepalm)  \n&gt;the damned thing is basically simmetrical  \n\nYup, that's right. He immediately jumped to the conclusion that someone had changed the settings, rather than the cleaning staff having flipped the mouse 180 degrees. Okay, a Magic Mouse is symmetrical, as he says, but still...\n\nShortly before I left, I happened across his desk and he'd left his computer unlocked. Naturally, I inverted his mouse settings :)",

Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany until they decided to move on. Also had a never-ending supplies of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!\n\n\n**$ITLead**: IT lead from current company.\n\n\n**$Tech**: Random technician working at the company.\n\n\n**$CEO**: CEO of the company. An older gentleman, knows how to run a company.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis tale takes place while $Selben and $Soda were running rogue. Switching from company to company as temps doing contract work. At this location, the company was decently sized, but only had two locations, about a 30 minute drive apart. $Selben was placed on the helpdesk alongside $Soda. The other two techs they were filling in for were getting married (*yes to each-other*) so it was a short two week deal during the honeymoon. Unfortunately, due to their short contract, not much time was spent getting them up to speed on all the processes. Anything outside of general SOP (*Standard Operating Procedure*) was pretty vague.\n\n\n\n\n$Selben and $Soda had been assigned their desks, a double cubicle. Each side was distinctively decorated for the his and her's which the previous lovebirds had been sitting in. $Selben drew the short straw and got the ‘Her's’ side, complete with the excessive pink--pens, paper and other stationary were so pink that they had a slight glow to them. $Soda had a pretty standard desk with only a few pictures of the couple. $Selben poked at a pink stuffed bear that leaned against his monitor as $ITLead walked up.\n\n\n&gt; $ITLead: I’ll send a link to our rough process flow, but basically, if you think you can fix it, go for it. If it's our proprietary software, just transfer the call to $Tech. Otherwise, if it's $CEO, just do what he wants. You’ll be taking calls, most are pretty basic. Thanks again for taking this on such short notice, $Soda!\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: No problem, sounds good!\n\n\n$ITLead made his leave, and $Selben and $Soda started taking calls. Things were pretty simple--How to use this, why won't this save, and why is this slow. After a few calls, $Selben got a more interesting call.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Hello, this is $Selben. How can I help you?\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: This is $CEO, my mouse isn't working. I need a new one!\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Sure! But just before we do that, what kind of mouse is it?\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: Let me check…\n\n\nThrough the headset, $Selben could hear papers being pushed around, and the unforgiving sound of plastic banging against a desk, before the out of breath voice of $CEO returned.\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: I don’t know! I’m going to bring it in so you can check!\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: I was just checking to see if… Hello?\n\n\nThe line had gone dead. $Soda slurped on his drink (which had appeared out of nowhere). His eyebrow was raised, $Selben simply shrugged. $Soda turned his attention back to his call, which naturally seemed to have nothing to do with tech support.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: I love Pomeranian puppies! Click next. Oh, you have to keep up on their grooming, though!\n\n\n$Selben resumed taking calls for the next 30 minutes or so until he heard the now familiar voice of $CEO. $Soda continued with his call as $CEO walked into the cubicle, and plopped his laptop and wireless mouse on the desk.\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: Mouse won't work!\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Let’s take a look!\n\n\nAfter several attempts, a bit of nervousness was setting in. $Selben almost started to sweat--this was the CEO of the company! And he was standing over his shoulder, going on about getting a replacement ASAP if this one wasn’t fixable! $Selben was trying to sync the mouse, but it just wasn’t working…\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: Do you think you can fix it, or should I ask $ITLead?\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Well… I, uh…\n\n\n$Soda spun around, and started chatting with $CEO.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: What kind of car do you have?\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: Oh, I have a $2002Kyoto!\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: Oh nice! How often do you replace the **batteries** in those?\n\n\n$CEO started rambling on about the savings and warranty, but $Selben realized what $Soda was telling him. He dug into the pink filled drawers until he produced a set of AA batteries. After putting them into the mouse, the cursor instantly popped up on the screen.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Good to go!\n\n\n&gt; $CEO: Perfect. Thanks! I’m asking for you next time!\n\n\nOver the next week, $CEO brought $Selben his laptop several more times for small issues similar to the first encounter. \n\n\nEarly into their last week, $Selben and $Soda were taking calls from people reporting slow network traffic at the second office. $ITLead stopped by with $Tech and let $Selben and $Soda know they were heading over to the other office to investigate the slowness. The office only being 30 minutes away had some advantages for situations like this. Almost immediately after they were out the door, a feverish number of calls came flooding in reporting the network was now completely down.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: I’ll try to reach out to $Tech and $ITLead to give them a heads up. Just stay on the calls and try to calm people down.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Got it!\n\n\n$Selben answered several more calls. It appeared none of the office workers communicated with each other, and ALL decided to call in on their own. $Soda finally got through to $ITLead. $Selben only heard $Soda’s side of the conversation.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: Yeah, we're letting people know…\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: Right… You what?\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: It's gone?\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: What should we do then?\n\n\n$Selben heard the familiar out of breath throat clearing as someone came up behind him. He turned slowly to see $CEO standing there, holding a rackmount router. $Selben pulled on $Soda’s sleeve.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: Ah, excellent. We found it. Want us to reboot it here?\n\n\n$CEO stood looking perplexed.\n\n\nApparently when the network slowed down and $CEO wasn’t able to reach the helpdesk due to the congested phone lines, he decided to take action… The only way he knew how. He went into the network room, unplugged the router, and drove it over to his favorite helpdesk employee $Selben to fix it. He was a nice enough guy, but just really didn’t understand how computers, or electronics of any kind worked.",

        "text": "The year was 2012 and I was a starry-eyed, freshly minted fibre channel consultant sent forth to assist a large computing company on the East Coast. My first day on the job, I arrive and find that their SAN has been experiencing massive performance issues for weeks now and this is day 4 of outages and kurfluffle. I quickly get set up, join the conference call, and introduce myself, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, only to hear an apoplectic CIO shout the dreaded words, \"Fix it today, or you're FIRED!\"\n\nTerror and panic coursed through me. How was I supposed to fix their problem when they had been on the phone with support and even development with no resolution? I began to think that my outrageous salary did not make up for this, and wondering if my consulting firm would cover the move back home if I got fired my first day. However, I already knew the worst it could be so, with nothing to lose, I told the CIO to give me logins and an hour or so to poke around and see what I could find. Logins supplied I headed into the labyrinth.\n\nLord, was it a mess. I've seen worse since, but, but at the time, not even working for Big Blue had prepared me for the mess that was this fabric. They had recently upgraded to 8gb directors, but they still had some legacy 4gb switches with 1gb devices plugged in. They had over 10,000 ports, at 85% populated, with no management software, and no monitoring set up. They had downlevel HBAs, OS's, you name it, plugged it and to top it off they were using ISLs instead of ICLs on their brand new, shiney 8510s. It was bad, but even all that put together shouldn't cause rolling fabric logins and fabric wide latency.\n\nFabric logins mean each port logs out and logs back in for whatever reason. This usually only happens when you plug a device into the port and it does the initial handshake but this was happening fabric wide, causing massive issues Something was very, very wrong, but what could it be?\n\n I gathered all the error logs for each port and, gathering my wits about me, I headed into the unknown of the interwebs, desperate to find something, anything that would allow me to keep my job, and per diem. On page 3 of an almost unrelated forum post, I found a flicker of hope! One of the top engineers had posted about a fillword issue on 8GB ports. Basically, 8gb ports with 8gb HBAs plugged in, handled fibre traffic differently, and needed a setting manually changed to allow the ports to work properly. (Here's a link if you're super bored or curious: https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003699)\n\nI checked the settings on the ports and lo and behold they were incorrect! I let the team know what I had found, they put in an emergency change, and I'll be darned if it didn't work. The fabric quieted down, the servers were able to access their data, and I was the hero...no cape, let's not be ridiculous. I spent 6 months at that company and got them running very smoothly. The CIO and I are still friends on FB and grab a beer on occasion. So ends the tale of the intrepid SAN consultant on her first day.\n\nTl;dr: My google-fu is strong and I get to keep my job.\n\nETA: Part of the problem was observing these counters that were not part of the normal diag process. I noticed these counters increasing and googled those and the post popped up. Regular support couldn't see the counters increment in real time, and the customer didn't know to look for the counters.

My phone rings its User.\n\n**User**: Are you here? \n\n**Me**: Yes I just got to my desk \n\n**User**: My key board isn't working I need you to replace it immediately. \n\n**Me**: ok, Ill grab you a new one. \n\nWith a heavy heart I trudged off towards what we call the grave yard which is a collection of old computers and boxes of computer parts. I grab a key board and head off toward users office. I walk in users office. \n\n**User**: My key board isn't working.\n\n**Me**: I got you a new one no worries.\n\nI approach her computer to see it is turned off. \n\n**Me**: Your computer is turned off (I push the power button it comes on)\n\n**User**: I never turn my computer off, why would it be off? \n\n**Me**: You never turn your computer off, not even over weekends?\n\n**User**: No it takes to much time. \n\nAt this point I just turned around in disbelief and walked out of users office. I later returned when user was at lunch to add a task to the task manager that shuts down their computer at the end of the day. \n\nHope this is formatted correctly, as this is my first tale worth sharing. \n\nEdit: Users computer is less than two years old and turns on fairly quickly. Keyboard was fine user just didn't know that a computer when turned off doesn't recognize keystrokes also didn't know what a turned off computer looks like. ",

        "text": "*As always, [the timeline](https://redd.it/7i0esb) of all my tales…*\n\nI arrived in Germany at the same time as one of our Electricians, whom we shall call $Vern.  $Vern and I were both Privates First Class and about as naive and inexperienced towards the Army as we could get.  During our first month in the unit, we were both sent to pay a visit to Chief Warrant Officer 3 $Mr. Neighborhood and ask him just how his neighborhood was doing and if we could be his neighbor.  \n\nIf I typed his response to our questions, the NSFW tag would likely melt and I wouldn’t be allowed to post here ever again.  He later found our platoon sergeant and explained to him any further instructions to us to ask stupid questions would result in beheading followed by defecation, followed by hunting down the platoon sergeant and doing the same to him.  As I got to know $Mr. Neighborhood, I learned how merciful he had been to us and how we really should have known better.  \n\n$Vern never quite learned that.  He was, in fact, a rather special case.  He was an Aircraft Electrician by training, but one thing we found out soon after his arrival was that he had a bit of trouble with wires.  In fact, it was an issue I only knew of one electrician before having—my grandfather—whose job was saved in part by seniority and by the union he was in.\n\n$Vern is colorblind, you see.  \n\nTurns out the colorblindness was discovered during training, but he was just pushed through the program anyway because quotas and problem-passed-problem-solved logic.  Needless to say, he wasn’t really allowed to ever work on aircraft once we found out and was being slowly processed to reclass into logistics.  This gave him additional time to do things like go to the gym, or lift weights…\n\n$Vern lived in the room next door to myself and $KG, his roommate being $Augie.  $Augie was definitely a kindred spirit, so he and $Vern lifted together, drank protein shakes together, clubbed together…you get the idea.  The two of them were always joined hand in hand whenever the Good Idea Fairy came by to visit.\n\nI have a [few stories about $Vern and $Augie]( https://redd.it/7kn5c7) both that don’t belong in TFTS….\n***\nSummer in Germany sometimes gets hot.  In America, when it gets hot, we just turn on the air conditioner, but in Europe you’re pretty much stuck either finding water to hide in, driving a lot, or simply dying from the heat.  My beater of an ‘88 Beretta had working A/C so I spent plenty of time on the road but $KG, between his attempts to murder his liver and his preferred entertainment choices, had to find another way to survive.  His solution was as common sense as it could get—a trip over to the Bauhaus led him to return to our room carrying a freestanding A/C unit.   It goes without saying that I helped him carry it up, put together a makeshift cardboard barrier for the window exhaust and then basked in the newfound cooling air.\n\n$Vern and $Augie, however…\n\nWell, into the second week of the heat wave, $Vern pops his head into our room….\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf, $KG**  “SHUT THE FRAKKING DOOR!”\n\n&gt;**$Vern**  “Woah, sorry.  Geeze.  Hey, ZeeWulf, can you come over and check out my fridge? It isn’t working anymore.”\n\nSkeptical, I grab my beer and follow him next door to his own room.  Just inside the room, I stop and let my face fall to my hands.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Seriously?”\n\n&gt;**$Vern** “It’s been getting worse all week.”\n\n&gt;**$Augie**  “It was working earlier, I don’t know what’s wrong with it now.”\n\n\nSitting atop a pair of stacked chairs was a box fan, which was positioned directly in front of the open freezer door.  The poor compressor had long since given up the ghost so all that could be heard from the fridge was the despairing whirr of the fans. \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “…I think you’re just going to have to request a new fridge.”\n\n\n**TL;DR:**  *A plant somewhere is crying over wasted effort.*",

I do notice that the screen is getting light as I see a faint white trace of light around the edges. Thinking and hoping this is not a bad screen, as we have had them occur in this same lab, I begin to unplug all the peripherals from the back and notice there is a strange light grey VGA cable plugged in. This is peculiar!!! *All our vga cables are black* Following the cable it leads into an HP Photosmart scanner that I have **never** seen in the classroom or building before. I unplug it and Voila!! Screen is now working again.\n\n\n\nThe teacher at this point comes over to me and asks in a surprised tone! *WHAT DID YOU DO?? WHAT HAPPENED? I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING!!* \n\n\nI then point to the scanner and grey cable and state well someone plugged a scanner into a VGA port in the back. The teacher has no idea of 1. Who plugged it in. 2. Where the scanner came from.\n\n\nNow to track down how an older HP scanner got into a lab and plugged itself in..... \n\n",

        "text": "Greetings, TFTS -- I, Dave-ros, have returned to impart another of my anecdotes. Davros may be the grotesque, evil genius who created the Daleks in *Doctor Who*, but despite naming myself in his honour, I certainly can't refer to myself as a \"genius\" -- though I did earn the moniker, briefly, early in my IT career...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis took place during my first proper IT job: thanks to my agency, having left my office admin job at the London Borough of *(cough)* Ralph &amp; Alice (where I'd been for over eight years), I was placed as a six-week unpaid intern (in order to get some \"experience\" on my CV), at a college in the west of London. So far west, in fact, that it didn't have a London postcode, and took me 90 minutes to commute each way by public transport (on a *good* day).\n\nNaturally, being a n00b, unfamiliar with the role and anxious as hell, I got sent out for all the first-line, customer-facing tasks:\n\n* Replacing printer toner (hey, it's a dirty job);\n\n* Resetting students' passwords (especially at the start of term, when they couldn't read the login details that had been e-mailed to their own addresses), or possibly reading them out from the web interface (yes, we stored them in plaintext!);\n\n* Running a batch file on staff computers (one of which mysteriously didn't recognise the **net** command), in some cases losing staff vital network drives;\n\n* Apologising to angry teachers because we'd run out of space for virtual desktops (the server not having enough memory and/or licences), and none of their students could log in for their classes *right this instant*;\n\n* Helping those who had opened multiple virtual desktops at once (by rapidly clicking the icon), or losing their virtual desktop behind the login window (Alt+Tab)...\n\nI'd also check all the classroom PCs at the start of every day, before sitting in the walk-in clinic for the morning (and then, mercifully, being allowed to sit in the IT department after lunch, away from the peasantry, letting the other intern suffer for a while). I often felt like a dogsbody, unappreciated by my team (just another short-term intern who needs no encouragement), and given all the worst jobs to do so I wouldn't handle anything important...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUntil one quiet morning, when a teammate (hereafter referred to as **$TM**) called me up and sent me to a classroom -- apparently they were getting messages that their Internet connection was being \"hacked\"!\n\nI locked the walk-in clinic, ran down the hall, and arrived to discover that, yes, Firefox was warning the teacher that potentially someone was tryting to hack in; Internet Explorer was also giving error messages... and all this simply because they were trying to Google something. Baffled, I called **$TM** (from my own mobile at this point) for guidance, but despite her greater knowledge and experience, she couldn't figure it out -- why would this be happening? What could possibly bring up such a weird error, in a quiet college environment?\n\nI'm sure some of you figured it out *just like that* -- and for me, it was a sudden epiphany (possibly one Terry Pratchett's \"inspiration particles\"): I remembered that Google had just recently gone over to **https:** by default... and when I looked at the clock in Windows, yes indeed, it was showing the wrong time -- and the mouse-hovering tooltip gave a date over *four years* in the past!\n\nAll the classroom PCs had recently been reimaged, and this one's motherboard battery must have gone flat when it was unpowered, hence the time and date having reverted to the time it rolled off the production line -- and with an SSL connection, a significant time/date mismatch like this causes errors, with Firefox in particular alerting the user to possible attempted hackery. (Apparently h4x0Rz can't tell the time?)\n\nSetting the time and date correctly resolved it at a stroke, and not only was the teacher relieved (perhaps less so the students), but **$TM** actually called me a \"genius\"! Finally, I felt like I was part of the team, and that IT was my calling...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOf course, a day or so later, **$TM** was the genius, and I was the clueless numpty: a lecture hall PC I'd confirmed to be working first thing was now not working at all, claiming its hard drive had no Windows installation, just after a guest lecturer arrived. I called my team in a panic, not able to see what was blatantly right in front of me -- and when **$TM** answered, her first question was simple: is there a USB thumbdrive connected?\n\nYes, the guest had plugged it in (to copy over a PPT or similar), and then inadvertently rebooted the PC while trying to figure out how to log in (not an unusual occurrence). My fault for not looking for it calmly and rationally, and I'm glad she kept her head and got me out of a tight fix... but hey, who had forgotten to turn off \"boot from USB\" in the BIOS after reimaging the PC? Huh? *Huh?!*",

Inside there was the usual Black, magenta, cyan and yellow cartriges, but below that was the waste toner.\n\nFor those that don't know, the waste toner box fills up as time goes by with excess toner that isn't used in the printing process. The mix of the four colours above make it a sort of browny black colour. Also, that shit stains, so when its full, you don't want it on you.\n\nSo i was on a call, and i saw someone come to my desk out of the corner of my eye. i initially ignored them, as i was busy with someone else. I finished the call, and turned to the new arrival. And laughed harder than i remember laughing ever.\n\nIt was one of the solicitors, who had seen the 'change waste toner' and thought he'd try it himself. Only when he'd taken it out, he hadn't been careful with it, and essentially poured the whole thing onto himself. He had a expensive white shirt on, which wasn't white anymore, though you could see that it once was white.\n\nOn seeing me laugh, his thunderous expression intensified, but that only made me laugh harder. It took a couple of minutes for me to collect myself, after which i told him \n\n\"i know exactly whats happened, next time let us handle it, and also before you ask, no, that doesn't come out so your shirt is ruined. I'll replace the waste toner\"\n\nin that entire time he hadn't said a word. even now, years later, i think of it and chuckle to myself. My manager, who sites behind me, just asks \"you thinking about christian and his shirt again?\"",

I've been trying to fix it for about an hour\".\n\nShe was using Excel and must've held CTRL while scrolling and changed the zoom setting, and now she couldn't figure out how to zoom out. So I showed her the incredibly easy and obvious slider bar...\n\nAs I went to walk away, leaving her possibly embarrassed by the simple solution to her problem, she tries to save face. She begins to tell me how she's an expert of \"The Excel\" and that she ran a multi-million dollar business for 5 years using nothing but \"The Excel\"....\n\nObviously, I know she's lying- but I don't want to be rude. So I politely nod and say \"Yea, that Zoom button is a tricky one\". I flash a smile and start to walk away.\n\nBut she can't let it go- she says \"I never used that zoom button before because I usually just control everything by writing formulas\"\n\nNow it's time for a fatality -  I say \"Oh really? Can you show me how to do that? Because I want to learn\". I pull a chair up to her desk and watch her unsuccessfully fumble through every possible menu, never even attempting to create a macro or type anything in the formula bar... \n\nAfter 5 minutes of cringe, she says \"I must've had a different version of \"The Excel\", because all of the menus are different.\"\n\nI let out a confused/amused \"alrighty\" and walk away.

        "text": "Edit: this turned out longer than anticipated so have some tldrs\n\nTl;dr Story 1: User wants a new modem sent out because his never arrived, overlooking the fact that it was registered post and he signed for receipt of the package.\n\nTL;dr story 2: User wants a new modem because his new one is faulty. In this situation, \"faulty\" means he couldn't get the lan cable to fit in the line port so he whittled it with a knife until it fit.\n\n/u/devdevo1919 and /u/linus140 sharing their modem-destruction stories reminded me of two quick ones from back when I worked at $LocalISP down under. Unfortunately these are not smashing stories, just modem-related.\n\n#STORY ONE\n\nUsers would order a modem from us, we'd ship it out by registered post.\n\n$Me: *blurb and identity confirmation, sup broseph?*\n\n$U: I never got the modem you sent, send me out another one.\n\n$Me: Are you sure?\n\n$U: Yes! I never got it, you have to send me a new one\n\n$Me: *because account notes are a wonderful thing* It looks like it was delivered and signed for. Would you like the non-emergency police number to report it stolen?\n\n$U: *Click*\n\n$Me: Yeah that's what I thought.\n\n#Story Two\n\n*Enter: The Helldesk prisoner. A cold 25C day in Australia, the wind howls outside. Or mayhaps that's the new manager howling. Hard to say; of equal substace and markedly less renewable-energy potential. The telephone screeches.*\n\n$Me: *I have no job satisfaction and I must scream.*\n\n$Geppeto: *The infernal machine betrays me. Render aid, lest my emails grow bloated and vengeful - preferably through the endowment of a new and yet more infernal machine!*\n\n$Me: *Forsooth!*\n\n[Basic cable check intensifies]\n\n$Geppeto: The cable wouldn't go in so I had to fix it.\n\n$Me: *Tis a wonderful tragedy that these windows don't open, lest I hurl myself to freedom from the seventh floor.*  Which cable are we having an issue with, and what do you mean by \"fix\" *our hero asks, dread creeping into his soul like the first chilly fingers of a winter's morning.*\n\n$Gepetto: The square one that goes in the  hole, it was too wide so I had to take a knife and whittle it to fit and now the whole thing doesn't work.\n\n$Me: *Forlornly our hero fantasizes of better employment opportunities, such as testing for land mines with a hammer.* Is this cable blue and thicker than the others in the box?\n\n$Gepetto: Yes *quoth the villain, all unawares of his villainy and believing himself the hero of the tale. Such is the way of evil men.*\n\n$Me: It sounds like that was the network cable, and you may have been trying to put it in the line port. Is there another cable in the box, perhaps thinner and a cream colour, with a more square head?\n\n*Gepetto rummages through a small box with the fervour that our hero rummages in his own soul for the strength to keep coming to this place.*\n\n$Gepetto: Yes! It looks like it would have fit better too, it's loose in the bigger holes.\n\n$Me: *Thus quoth she* Does it fit in that first port that you had issues with?\n\n$Gepetto: Yup, but you should send me a new modem - this whole package is faulty.\n\n$Me: *Trust not the word of the User, for they are full of deception.* Let's just double check - could you plug the other end of that cable into a working telephone socket, and make sure the black power cable with the round head is plugged into an active powerpoint and the round black port at the end of the modem?\n\n$Gepetto: *Follows these instructions well enough to masquerade as a functional kindergartener* Done.\n\n$Me: Now let's see which lights come on, on the front of the modem.\n\n[Some labourious minutes later]\n\n$Me: Okay, so it sounds like your modem can see your phone line just fine. That cable you whittled, can it still be inserted into one of the wider holes?\n\n$Gepetto: I think so, but I still think this won't work and you should just send me a new one.\n\n$Me: If the modem turns out to be faulty, we will certainly do that *over the sweet release of my death*.\n\n[Longer than it should have taken later]\n\n$Me: Great, it looks like you're able to browse the internet and your emails are coming into outlook so everything is working.\n\n$Gepetto: Are you sure you can't send me a new modem?\n\n$Me: *Certainty is an illusion, the tiny campfire around which we huddle to protect ourselves from the terror of the unknown as we each of us slowly die* Absolutely! Your modem is working, your wifi is working, and your connection is steady. The blue cable might slip out because of the whittling, if that keeps happening you may want to go to the shops and buy a new one.\n\n$Gepetto: Why don't you send me a replacement?\n\n$Me: *for the same reason I don't send animals to be put down* I can certainly organise a new one for you, would you like to pay over the phone or have it added to your next monthly bill?\n\n$Gepetto: Can't you send it for free?\n\n$Me: *freedom is a lie* If it had been faulty we definitely would. However, you took a knife to it which doesn't mean it was faulty - especially considering it does actually work. Is there anything else I can help you with today? *A pox upon your house if you dare answer in the affirmative*\n\nSpoiler alert: he did not.",

        "text": "**[Timeline](https://redd.it/6v3az8) of my other stories separated by company.**\n\n***\n\n[This](https://redd.it/7jmvxo) story about smashing modems from u/devdevo1919 reminded of this little gem when I was a customer service representative at $SecurityCompany. Now before you say “but customer service isn’t IT”, let me explain the position. They *called* us CSRs, but what we really did was mostly technical support for the residential and small business security systems as well as some customer service functions. We had a separate team for the large businesses.\n\nI haven’t worked there since 2015, so I’m not sure if the policy is still the same, though I doubt it changed. When someone calls in for anything we have to verify they are who they say they are. Pretty simple right? Almost every place does this. They can verify multiple ways: phone password or last four of their social security number. The caveat to the last four of their social, is that it *has* to be an owner of the account on the phone that gives us the social *and* their social has to be on our records.\n\nThe day started out pretty normal. I was in my cubicle taking the normal calls, mostly PIN resets for the keypad and people wanting to pay their bills. Pretty simple day. Until $Negan calls.\n\n$Negan calls in with a typical problem: his keypad is beeping from a low battery and he can’t get it shut off because he forgot his four digit PIN for his keypad. So I try to go through the normal pleasantries when the call turns south real quick.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: $SecurityCompany, $Me speaking. Can I have your name and password please?  \n&gt; **$Negan**: My name is $Negan and I don’t remember my password.  \n&gt; **$Me**: Well, sir, I could verify you with the last four of your social we have on record. Except we don’t don’t have one on record for you.  \n&gt; **$Negan**: THAT’S BULLSHIT! THIS IS MY ACCOUNT!  \n&gt; **$Me**: Sir, the only thing I can do right now is mail you out your password.  Without your password, the only thing I can do is help you power down your security system.  \n\nSide note: We were very limited on what we could and could not do if we couldn't verify the individual.\n\n&gt; **$Negan**: *shouting so loud now I had to move my headset away from my ear* THIS IS BULLSHIT! I DON’T KNOW MY FSCKING PASSWORD! YOUR GOD DAMN SYSTEM WON’T SHUT THE HELL UP, BUT I AM NOT TURNING IT OFF! EITHER HELP ME NOW OR I WILL RIP THIS PIECE OF SHIT OFF THE WALL AND MAIL IT BACK TO YOU!  \n&gt; **$Me**: Sir, if you could please calm down, I could help you with powering it down until you receive your password so we can fix the actual issue. Also, please refrain from talking like that or I will have to terminate the call.  \n\nI was in Army, so I’m not easily offended, and swearing doesn’t bother me. It was, like most places, company policy to terminate the call once it got hostile after at least one warning. I don’t mind if you call me for help and want to call the equipment a vulgar name, I’ve done that before and got a good laugh out of the tech on the phone.\n\nHowever, once it’s directed towards me I will warn and terminate the call for multiple reasons. One being it’s been company policy at every job I’ve been at after leaving the Army. And two, you should at least be respectful to the person **you called for help**. Basic principles, but I digress.\n  \n&gt; **$Negan**: FSCK YOU, YOU PIECE OF TRASH!  \n&gt; **$Me**: Sir, I am going to terminate this call since you can’t seem to calm down. Please call back when you have your password.  \n&gt; **$Negan**: I WILL KILL -- *click*\n\nAfter disconnecting the call, I put myself into break mode and go outside for a well deserved smoke break. Once I come back in, since I still had his account pulled up in our software, I see a notification from our central station on the account. I open the monitoring page and see a notification (I honestly forget what the notification was called) for all of his motion detectors, glass breaks, door sensors, and the keypad on his system being disconnected.\n\nI also see a note from central station, this is the team that is monitoring the alarms 24/7, that they were able to contact the wife who knew the damn password. She wasn’t sure what was going on and was heading home. There was a note from central station about twenty minutes later to send out a technician to diagnose some damage done.\n\nI checked the account two days later when the tech went out. The technician’s notes had my jaw drop. $Negan ripped every single piece of equipment we installed off the walls, door frames, etc. and threw them in a pile on the front lawn. He then proceeded to beat the equipment with a baseball bat before dowsing them in gasoline and lighting them on fire. To replace all of this would have cost $2,000 for the equipment plus $150 per hour of labor to install it all back since anything that isn't normal wear and tear is not covered under the insurance. The installation estimate was about six hours. $Negan’s wife cancelled instead.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: Lucille is fed and satisfied.  \n**TL;DR 2**: Angry customer Hulk/Negan smashes equipment with baseball bat and lights it on fire because verification is hard.\n\nEdit: Clarified a couple things.  \nEdit 2: Added a more relevant TL;DR.  \nEdit 3: Clarified a line.",

        "text": "I worked for a retail-styled computer repair business for two years and have finally decided to stop lurking and tell this story. To give an idea of the situation there are three characters in this story, we will have them labeled as the following:\n\n&gt;**$G** - Customer\n\n&gt;**$ME** - Me\n\n&gt;**$CO** - New tech in training\n\nWorking in the southeastern part of the country brings in a very healthy mix of clientele. We see a lot of people from larger metropolitan areas, and conversely, the most rural. \n\nOne day we had a customer come in telling us that her machine will not turn on. She was a gamer, and explained that during a game, her machine had turned off and failed to turn back on after many attempts. **$CO** comes back to consult me on the matter, and see what my thoughts were. \n\nI immediately assume the PSU as it was an off the shelf machine with an added GPU. I run and grab my multi-meter (**$G** still sitting with **$CO** in front of shop). Getting a solid 11.8v and still no indication of power. Remove front I/0 and jumped power with a screwdriver, and nada. \n\nUpon some further investigation, everything else seemed to be in pretty good shape -- until I see dirt and what looks like moisture around the GPU and the floor of the case. So I ask:\n\n&gt;**$ME**: Do you use this computer in a garage or shed?\n\n&gt;**$G**: No, it stays in my living room. Why?\n\n&gt;**$ME**: There seems to be a bit of moisture in here, there could have a been a short. Not looking good for the board at this point. \n\n&gt;**$G**: Do you think this is something that could be fixed?\n\n&gt;**$ME**: I'll have to check every component, but you'll definitely need a board regardless. \n\nAs I go looking for the model print on the board, I see a bit of dirt fall from under the GPU. I had been standing up the whole time with a table the height of about my waist so I hadn't got down low enough to see from that angle. I decide to turn on my phone flashlight and check to see how damaged the card was from underneath. \n\nI am immediately met with a cute mother cockroach cuddling up with her 30 or so offspring. \n\n&gt;**$ME**: Hey **$CO**, *(trying to bring his attention to the problem)* can you read that model number for me?\n\nHe falls silent and looks up in fear. I imply there's a tool we need in the back of the shop and both go back to discuss what we had seen. I immediately drown  my hands in my Purell, and offer **$CO** the opportunity to explain the situation with the customer. \n\nShe ended up purchasing a new machine, and I don't believe she was made aware of the family she had living with her. \n\nThe best part was when we started noticing roaches around the shop, and ended up with an infestation that had to be taken care of by an exterminator. \n\nNice.

        "text": "For once, a TFTS that has nothing to do with a user!\n\nI manage the Linux labs at my college campus, but I also maintain the Windows and Distance Learning Center labs from time to time, especially during testing periods. During finals week, this can be incredibly frustrating, since sitting in a lab, watching students take a final is so much more boring than taking the final itself. I’m not even allowed to have a phone.\n\nMost Finals are boring, unrestricted ones, but a few online professional certifications and placement tests are very strict in their requirements. How we set up for these tests is to boot the computer into a temporary Live OS, which does not save any settings, and automatically opens Firefox full screen in Incognito mode.\n\nFirefox is the only thing that is allowed to run, and if the window closes, the computer reboots, resetting the OS back to defaults. If the user leaves the page set by the test taker, the browser closes. If they open a terminal or other program not allowed by that test (like a calculator) then the system is locked until a proctor (usually me) unlocks the screen.\n\nWhile the professor or administrator walks around, I watch everyone’s screens, along with three security camera feeds to make sure there is no cheating. All of this is recorded, so that we can validate anything later on if we need to.\n\nJust after the last exam, when I’m preparing to leave, the phone for the room rings. It’s my manager. The day gets progressively worse from there.\n\n\n$CIO - My manager (whose initials are CIO to the actual CIO’s annoyance)\n$Me - Me\n\n$CIO: Did you add any plugins to Firefox before these tests?\n\n$Me: No, it’s stock Firefox.\n\n$CIO: No it’s not. There’s a plug-in called Looking Glass that’s not supposed to be there.\n\nI check one of the computers and, sure enough, it’s there.\n\n$Me: I didn’t install that. (Reboots computer) Its not there on boot. Looks like some kind of automatic plugin installation.\n\n$CIO: Well (professional, very expensive certification test) was invalidated because of this plugin. They’re making everyone retake it.\n\n(Lots of panic, stress, and fruitless research later)\n\n$Me: looks like it was an automatic installation from Mozilla.\n\n$CIO: Really? I want to know exactly what this plugin does. Make sure that doesn’t happen with the next exam in ten minutes.\n\n$Me, now pissed off at everything: Gotcha. (Uninstalls Firefox, installs Chromium) (edit: and changed the name of Chromium executable to Firefox)\n\n$CIO: I’ll get the other test sorted out. That’s my problem now.\n\n\nTL;DR Firefox’s automated plugin installation invalidated a certification test, quick fix was to install Chrome.\n\nPS: The invalidated test was un-invalidated, so yay.",

        "text": "Hello again TFTS, it's been quite a plentiful year and even though it's not yet over and there's plenty of time for greater stories yet to come, in our company, after this call, we had to award this person \"Idiot of the DECADE\" award.\n\nOne last bit of background, since my last post (few months back) I've now started IT consultancy/support at another place (which I absolutely love for the people I work with). This firm offers its services to private medical clinics only so we're dealing with doctors, PA's, nurses or secretaries.\n\nSo, usual day today, going through calls like hot butter, easy stuff like printer this, or slow computer that. And here comes the golden ticket. We shall name her *$IDA* (Idiot Decade Award). My colleague picked up but he's not an IT guy and helps a lot with calls/callbacks for us as we hate to put clients on voicemail. Another colleague was free and said, \"I can deal with her, put her through!. We shall refer to this person as *$PB* (Poor Bastard).\n\nI won't try trouble you here with 45 (yes 45 minutes) of phone conversation of him trying to help her type in her password. Trying to also explain what \"case-sensitive\" is and such. Of course he also did a password resent and made it *Password123*. All in vain, as $IDA did not know what capital letter is, despite her 30ish years of existence on this planet.\n\nWell, it's not exactly true to say she didn't know what capital letters are, she did, but under a different name... **CapsLock**. Going forward, we were trying to listen in as much as we could as we could physically notice whatever was left of his hair (after him pulling it like a madman) going grey. Over and over and over again, password did not unlock her computer. To note, he didn't remote to her machine as it was really unnecessary (or so we thought) and all she had to do was type in a bloody password in her Windows login, with her first name as username.\n\nHe decides she's either too dumb to do it or something truly horrific has happened, so he's got his coat and went over in person as the clinic was close by in a decent walking range. Of course, from here on out everything I can tell you is from what he relayed but this is the internet so you can only have my word for it, but how can I take his? Despite being a good trusted colleague? Well he thought if that in advance and literally took his phone out to record her attempting the following, and here the story continues:\n\n&gt; $PB: Ok, so show me, what exactly are you doing when you try to login and it tells you password not working?\n\n&gt; $IDA: *Types in username on PC keyboard... reaches hand to her ~~mobile~~ work extension phone to type in password*\n\n&gt; $PB: Wait what?... Is this a joke? Am I being recorded right now?\n\n&gt; $IDA: No, that's how I've always tried it, and it doesn't work.\n\n&gt; $PB: *takes phone out and asks her to try it again all while she thought her issue was so serious he had to \"document it\" by filming*\n\nFor some reasons, she didn't work there long. Nothing to do with us, still a mystery to why she was let go...(not).\n\nHe did show her in the end what she was doing \"wrong\" but we just could not have believed him without that recording. I've read a lifetime load of stories on this sub but I just gotta say, this person takes the cake, the cherry, the whole goddamn bakery too.\n\n\nEdit*: First off, when the post started kicking off I was at the Christmas party and we were still... shocked by the fact but having fun reading all the replies, also getting drunk and replied to some comments while half asleep in bed at 1 am. Good morning to all I suppose.\n\nSecond of all, I hope I haven't missed any typo corrections like capitol-&gt;capital letters. Thank you for all the users that pointed that out. And the edit for clarity. Had brain fart moment and don't know what possessed me to type that.\n\nThree: no 2FA...no... trust me... she was not smart enough to know what that is. \n\nLast, but definitely not least, WOW, gold, the chances can't be more magical. I turned on the sound system in the house as I woke up and first thing on my playlist was Spandau Ballet - Gold, then I saw it, thought I was still asleep. Thank you Anon, but please would you reveal to us poor souls, who you are when you ring the office!! (We have a client with private number so it always shows as Anonymous when they ring us and we always laugh \"but who is this Anon person!?!?!\"\n\nEdit2: more formatting\n\n",

        "text": "The phone calls below happened yesterday and reminded me to write my [last post about Mildred](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7js9gd/mildred_prints_everything/). \n\nI'll recap relevant context and I'll add a bit more. I do tech support for a (non-US) government agency. We developed a few online applications for schools. Access to these sites is obviously restricted and the rights are managed through a different online application called *$RM* (Rights Management). Principals are automatically assigned admin rights, so they can grant access to online applications as necessary and they can appoint other admins as well. \n\nMildred has an administrative job in some school and lacks the most basic computer skills. Yet for some reason, Mildred was appointed as an admin in *$RM* for her school. \n\nSomething I've also addressed in the comments before: I don't fire up teamviewer for Mildred that easily anymore. I'm already her go-to IT-guy and I'm not happy with it. The least I can do is stop doing everything for her through remote access and have her do everything herself. \n\n---\n\nSo yesterday morning Mildred calls in with her trademark lack of introduction and immediately starts explaining today's problems. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: My new colleague starts tomorrow and I have to give her access to a site. Do I have to use *$RM* for that? \n\nTo be fair, most people need some directions the first time they have to use *$RM*, but once you understand some basic principles the rest becomes pretty self-explanatory. \n\nAt first she got an error while trying to log on. I ask her to close her browser and try again. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: What's a browser?\n\nMildred, please, we've been over this. I also had to explain that she had to press the button with the 'X' in the top right corner to close it and then correct her when she got it wrong. But at least she was able to log on the second time. \n\n&gt; **Me**: First you'll see the terms of use, you'll have to scroll down and accept them to be able to continue. Are you on the homepage now? \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: *starts reading an entire wall of text*\n\n&gt; **Me**: You're reading the news flashes on the homepage. \n\nShe could've just read the big bold letters that say 'Homepage' at the top.  \n\n&gt; **Me**: On the right side, you should see 'Search user'. There you can enter first and last name. \n\nI wait while she finds the link and enters the names.\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: And now? \n\n&gt; **Me**: Press the 'Search' button. \n\n*Silence*\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: Nothing's happening. \n\n&gt; **Me**: *Err*... Did you click 'Search' and wait for the page to load?\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: Yes... Ow, the results are at the bottom.\n\nI take her through the rest of the process. If you think the conversation above might be going slow because maybe Mildred didn't have her morning coffee yet, think again. In a previous phone call I've already had to explain that you only need your mouse to click on a link, you don't have to type anything. She also says 'clip' with your mouse button instead of 'click' and doesn't know what the start menu is. \n\nThe entire call takes about 20 minutes. She has the audacity to end with this:\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: It's difficult. \n\nNo, it's not. I've given the same instructions to several more people in less then 10 minutes and they all got it at the end. \n\n---\n\nThis wouldn't be a Mildred story if it ended here. A little over 3 hours later (I've looked it up in our logs, there's 3 hours and 20 minutes between these 2 entries). \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: I've called this morning to give access to a colleague who's starting tomorrow. I've done it for one school and have to do it for a few more, but I've forgotten what I have to do. \n\n*How?* After some enquiry, I figure out that's she's already in the next to last step. \n\n&gt; **Me**: The only thing you have to do now is click the button 'Next'. On the next page you get the option to change a few things (*#Note: here you can change the starting and end date, no one gets rights for eternity*), but everything will work fine if you click 'Next' again. Now you'll see an overview of what you entered in the previous steps. If everything is correct, click the button 'Confirm'\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: What does 'Gives access to the web portal *$myschool.edu* mean? \n\n&gt; **Me**: This gives acces to *$myschool.edu*...\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: Ow.\n\n&gt; **Me**: After you've clicked 'Confirm', it should take you to the overview of the rights you've given your co-worker. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: *starts reading what she sees on her screen*\n\n&gt; **Me**: You haven't clicked 'Confirm' yet. \n\nAnother side-note: this isn't a way to anonymize the story or to hide details or anything similar, this is what she does. Instead of reading back the title, header, url or anything relevant or descriptive, she starts reading back some random part of the page and I have to figure out what she's looking at. \n\n&gt; **Me**: Okay, so now you should see the list of rights you've given your co-worker. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: I see school 1 and school 2, but not school 3. \n\n&gt; **Me**: Scroll down the page. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: Ah, yes, there it is. \n\n---\n\nFollow-up later that day. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: I've done all these steps on my computer, but she'll work on her own computer. Will that work? \n\n&gt; **Me**: Yes, those are websites. They work on any computer that's connected to the internet. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: She'll also have to enter her e-mail address to receive the notifications. I don't know if she can do that. \n\nYou log on, go to 'Profile', enter your address and click save. She'll manage. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: And she needs a shortcut on her desktop. \n\n&gt; **Me**: She can call us if she needs help with that. \n\nBut I honestly hope she won't. \n\n---\n\nBonus call, she called again for a follow-up this morning. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: My new colleague started this morning. She can't log on to any websites yet, but she can log on to *$RM*\n\n&gt; **Me**: If she can't log on to any site, how do you know she can log on to *RM*? \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: She forgot her password and has to go home later today to go get it, but when she follows the link to login to *$RM* she gets to see the page with the different login options!\n\n&gt; **Me**: Well, you only specify who's trying to log on *after* you choose how you login. If you aren't telling your computer who's trying to login, how can it know if that person is allowed to login at all? \n\n---\n\nAt the end of the day I honestly looked up the symptoms for dementia. I'm not a doctor and even if I was, I wouldn't be able to diagnose her over the phone, but I honestly think she might be showing signs of dementia. She's not even 60. \n\nEdit: deleted a sentence that I entered twice. ",

It was revealed they had somehow made it to this point without any in house IT support, aside from $Rabbit who had fallen into the role of I.T. support when they rebooted something, many systems had either no password or were poorly optimized (*One of the $6000 blade servers being used as a file storage for 5gb of data*).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a day or two $Selben sat in their office overlooking the city - the view was impressive. $Rabbit noisily chewed on a carrot - while ranting about how poorly the last temps they brought in had messed up some random system. $Soda was poring over the documentation left by one of the numerous technicians - so he could login to some critical systems which had been acting up, $Soda had made it clear this was not the best method (constantly bringing in techs whenever something broke) with minimal convincing and his role was to get them access into their systems so work could continue without completely coming to a halt because no one knew the password to reboot a single VM. $Selben was in the helpdesk role, with $Rabbit being his direct report - Rabbit would get an email or call and send $Selben out to someones desk to would deal with simple break, fix and educate type of incidents. Things were going well and $Selben was glad that they had a stable setup for several months ahead of them, with a fairly high chance of being kept on if things went well.\n\n&gt; $Rabbit: Hey $Selben… Can you head over to $Speedy’s desk, she’s having some issue with the spreadsheet again.\n\n$Rabbit took a large bite of a carrot, and turned back to stare at her empty ticket queue. (Clearly she was busy)\n\n&gt; $Selben: Sure!\n\nThe spreadsheet they had was a shared excel document, containing almost all day to day sales and critical company info… It was VERY large and often times it would stop syncing or someone would forget to logout - the fixes were typically pretty simple…\n\n&gt; $Selben: Hey $Speedy, have a minute for me to look at that?\n\n&gt; $Speedy: Yea okay, I’ll be back in 20 minutes or so. I need to do a store run, do you want anything?! I think we’re low on creamer, did we make progress on the systems access to the backup drives yet? Never-mind okay, I’ll be back my password is under my keyboard!\n\n$Speedy was out the door before $Selben could get a word in, so he plopped down at her desk to take a look.\n\n$Selben minimized a few windows and found the document in question. It was blank, so $Selben closed it out - naturally it offered to save and he clicked ‘No’ - he then reopened the document and saw it was filled out per normal, good to go. He returned to his desk, created a ticket and sent $Speedy an email letting her know it was fixed.\n\nRoughly a week later, $Soda got approval to go to the data-center where the servers were being housed and opted to bring $Selben along - leaving $Rabbit in charge of the office for a few hours. Things went well, only taking around 5 hours - $Soda was able to get logged into everything and was able to reconfigure a couple servers that had not even been configured for remote connection. With that done, they stopped by a local Barbecue place for some lunch! Halfway through both of their cell phones started blowing up with calls, a frantic $Speedy was somehow talking faster than normal and needed help immediately. They rushed back to the office to find that the spreadsheet had gone blank for everyone in the office.\n\n$Soda was able to pull up the previous days backup, and recover the file - it was discovered that $Rabbit had clicked ‘Yes’ when prompted to save while helping ‘fix’ the document. Unfortunately a few of the investors had been visiting that day and opted to end the contracts for the I.T. temps - including $Selben and $Soda. But it wasn’t so bad because they paid out the full four month contract in one lump sum!",

        "text": "A friend/coworker of my brother-in-law bought a new external drive to backup her files. (Yay, they're learning!) We'll call her $Friend since I've known her for several years too, just not closely. When $Friend plugged in the aging external drive, it would just make noise and her computer wouldn't find it. Knowing that I'm a tech guy, my brother-in-law asked if I could take a look. Now, I can hear the \"oh no don't...\"s and I admit I've said that when reading a lot of tales of supporting friends and family, but still figured what's the worst that can happen?\n\nI plugged the external drive into my nice strong workhorse Windows 10 laptop and it immediately went to a black screen while it chugged along. Two hours later it recognized the drive but couldn't (wouldn't?) read it.\n\nThe drive is one of those big external Seagate ones in the bulky grey USB-adapter housing. A buddy got the special security screw bits to open it up so we could remove the original USB/IDE adapter and use a known-good one so we could eliminate a possible point of failure. That didn't help. :(\n\nTried it in my older and way-less-powerful Windows 7 laptop and the drive was detected but not readable. Launched photorec, and after many hours it had processed ~8% and the drive was hot. Decided to shut it down for the night. Moved over to testdisk and had better luck, but still missing a lot.\n\nBooted an old Xubuntu disk and went to the command line. Plugged in the old Seagate - lo and behold after a minute or two of complaining from the drive itself, I could see it! Managed to get almost everything off with **cp** and mainly **dd**. It took a long time though. I could only have the drive spinning for about 25-30 minutes before getting a bunch of I/O errors and had to let it cool down.\n\nNow, here's the fun part... $Friend send my wife the following message on facebook, which reminds me of why I do this:\n&gt; $MyWife please please tell $Me thank you for recovering my hard drive. I am literally in tears right now seeing videos of my kids that I thought were lost forever. I am truly grateful and forever indebted to $Me. Words just can't express my gratitude!\n\nStay strong out there this holiday season folks. We all have family and friends that will ask us for our help.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes the tears are good ones.",

She’s very nice, tries very hard but doesn’t have a single clue as to how anything related to technology even works. She has a tendency to call her ISP for just about everything, even if it’s totally unrelated to them. I’m sure anyone working at any ISP who posts here might have posted a story about her at some point. She’s harmless, but really has no idea what she’s talking about.\n\nShe came by to ask a handful of questions, mostly about adding bookmarks and a few about how reliable real estate apps are, but she also had a gem of a story which I must share. \n\n&gt;$PATRON: Before I go, I have one more question for you. I went to $LocalBank to learn how to pay my bills online. They told me I had to go to The Google and download The Internet Bank but I couldn’t do it at the bank because they don’t have The Google there. I went home and called $ISP to make sure I had The Internet Bank on The Google. They told me I had to restart the internet to get The Internet Bank on The Google. \n\n&gt;I did that but I still couldn’t find it! I called $LocalBank and they said to call The Google. It took me forever to find a number for The Google but when I did, I got to talk to Kyle, from The Google. I told him I need The Internet Bank so I could pay my bills. He told me how to get the Internet Bank but we couldn’t find it and he said he would keep looking.\n\n&gt;Kyle gave me this Google Number, I was just wondering if this is my Google Account number? Should I keep this in case Kyle, from the Google, finds The Internet Bank? \n\nI just kinda blinked at her for a few seconds, before explaining that it wasn’t her Google Account number and she can get rid of it. I was even able to show her the right app to download and let her know that she didn't need to call Kyle back to tell him to stop looking. She was very concerned that poor Kyle, from The Google, is sitting there all day searching for The Internet Bank.\n",

        "text": "Years ago, I was working as a student intern at the fourth-best public  university in that particular state, working at the hell desk of our internal IT department. Sometimes we were stuck in the \"call center\", answering phone calls from prospective students, nosy parents, arrogant professors, and...professors emeriti. Free use of the Help Desk was granted to any emeritus who wanted to contact us with their modern marvels of technical impossibilities.\n\n\nToday's lucky caller was an elderly woman, I would guess in her mid 80's. After confirming her university ID we got right down to the grim reality of her present condition.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDefine variables:\n\nEP=\"Emerita Professor\"\n\nMe=\"Me\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n$EP: \"The internet is gone!\"\n\n$Me: \"What do you mean by 'gone'? Are you unable to connect to the internet in your home? Is this on your computer or on a device like an iPad or phone?\"\n\n$EP: \"I'm calling you on my phone! The internet is GONE from my computer! All of it! I try to go there, and it's not there!\"\n\n$Me: \"So just to confirm, you're opening up a web browser and the page is blank?\"\n\n$EP: \"GONE!\"\n\nWe did some quick troubleshooting - I figured out she was on Windows, probably XP, and the internet seemed ok -- I guided her to the WiFi icon and she described a normal situation there. As we're doing this I find an old ticket from her and see that she had called us many times before, and some of those calls required remote assistance. She must have the [totally licensed] software that we used for assistance installed. I managed to (I'm not sure how) get her to launch that and tell me the right code, etc.\n\nI get access to her system, and I'm greeted by a cleaner desktop than I'm expecting. Sure, there are an unnecessary number of icons and pictures on the desktop, but it's really not *that* bad. \n \n\n$Me: \"Ok, so just go ahead and go to the internet like normal.\"\n\n$EP: \"You see, I click this icon..\" [clicks on Mozilla Firefox] \"...and the internet is gone. All of it.\"\n\nMozilla loads up Google. \n\n$Me: \"...\"\n\n$EP: \"See? It's all gone.\"\n\n$Me: \"What would you normally do here?\"\n\n$EP: \"Go to the internet...but it's not here.\" Her cursor moves up to the top of the bar where bookmarks would normally be.\n\n$Me: \"Has anything changed with your computer recently?\"\n\n$EP: \"Yes, my nephew put the new internet on here. But as I said, it doesn't work!\"\n\nGears start turning. New internet means new web browser, most likely.\n\n$Me: \"Did you used to have bookmar--links up there that you would click?\"\n\n$EP: \"YES! The internet!\"\n\n$Me: \"What did they say?\"\n\n$EP: \"The internet one was called 'Yahoo'.\"\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI created her bookmark, right then and there. She proceeded to type in the name of the university, click the fifth link that Yahoo brought up, and follow various breadcrumb links until she got to the email login.\n \nI could not, no matter how I tried, convince her that she could type into the address bar and go places. She was (and as far as I know, still is) convinced that the only way the internet worked was through that one bookmark. I even tried to add a bookmark for her university email, but she *did not trust it*. Yahoo for life.",

        "text": "This is a story on how i got a free raspberry pi at work. Well, tehnically it is a story about how i fixed the network for a rather large building. Bear with me, it's a bit long.\n\n*****\n\n**The setup**\n\nThe company i work for is fairly diversed. It's mainly an automotive supplier, but there's also other branches. If i tell you examples, you'll figure out who i work for fairly quickly. Either way, there's also a huge and fast movement towards IoT, as in Internet of Things. Which means connect everything to the internet.\n\nOne certain department was doing some IoT stuff with Industrial machines. \n\n**The people**\n\n$User: A guy who opened a ticket.\n\n$FCM: My facility management guy.\n\n$Buddy: A buddy of mine, who i told way-back-when to throw an application at my employer and drop my name during the interview. This helped him get an apprenticeship.\n\n$Phrewfuf: The guy that still doesn't have enough whiskey to deal with this...\n\n*****\n\n**The outage**\n\nOne day, while i'm sitting there, minding my own business, working in red-light district aka monitoring duty, when a ticket pops in. A ticket with the urgency level \"Critical\". Fark...this usually means business.\n\nI open the thing up and read it. \n\n&gt; Network not working. \n\nAlright. \n\n&gt; Computers that have been restarted or reconnected to the network are not able to access anything in the network.\n\nHold on a second...this smells like...\n\n&gt; Please see attached screenshots for ipconfig /all output\n\nHoly mother of user, batman, this guy actually knows how to get me all the info i need. I was actually flabbergasted at this point.\n\nAfter needing a moment to regain my composure i check the screenshots. Lo and behold, just as expected. This guy has an IP-address out of a range that is not used in the whole worldwide company. And there's also the IP-Address of the DHCP server that gave him said address. Also one that should not exist. Which means: rogue DHCP server somewhere in that building.\n\nI call the guy on his mobile, as trying to reach him on his VoIP phone would be futile.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hey, $Phrewfuf here, from central IT, networking. I'm calling about that ticket of yours.\n\n&gt; $User: Oh hi, yeah, we're having somewhat of a large issue here. *he explains it all to me very briefly* \n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Yup, just as i thought, you've got a DHCP server that shouldn't be there. Thanks for your detailed description, now i know what the issue is and how to solve it. But i need your help. Your PC is not working right now, is that correct?\n\n&gt; $User: Yes.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Awesome. Could you open the console and ping the address of the DHCP server real quick?\n\n&gt; $User: Done, it's replying.\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Very nice. Now execute a \"arp -a\", search the output for that address and read me the MAC address for that entry.\n\n&gt; $User: *reads me the MAC of the DHCP server*\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Ok, give me a few seconds. *using the MAC, i asked some switches in that building to tell me, where to find said MAC address and disabled the port* Alright, it's all good now. But you need to tell your PC to get a new DHCP lease.\n\n&gt; $User: OK. Done, i'm getting the right address now. Should i tell the people around to do the same? \n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Exactly.\n\nAfter ending the call, i drop the relevant info in the ticket and close it.\n\nHonestly, 15 minutes later he calls me. Same thing again. Someone must have sticked the thing into the next available port. Same process to solve it, but this time i'm pissed. Fool me once, joke's on me, fool me twice and you'll wish you didn't. What i did was calling one of our facility management guys. I knew he was around the building with the issue. Told him to go find the port and whatever is connected to it. Mind you, this was around lunch time, so most people were not in their offices. \n\nHe walks in there like a boss, looks around and finds a running raspberry pi. An uncertified device in my network is bad by itself, but this one was next level. He grabs some guy in there and asks him who's responsible for that. The call was still open, so i heard everything, including a name. I looked it up, it was a group leader. Dis gon be gud.\n\nWhile i was thinking how to proceed with this, i hear my guy saying \n\n&gt; $FCM: I'm taking that with me. It's impounded now. Central IT will have to report this to your department leader. *I'm sitting there, trying not to laugh too loudly* Mr. $Phrewfuf, are you in the office right now? I'm bringing the device to you so you can get it up the chain and do your process. *We're usually on the familiar you, not the formal \"mr. surname\" you. And we actually don't have any process for that, he just made all that up on the spot. 10/10 acting, i tell you.*\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: *still laughing* Sure thing, man, you can just give it to my colleague, he's in the warehouse next building.\n\nAn hour later, i'm holding a raspi in my hands. And i get a chat message from $Buddy.\n\n&gt; $Buddy: Dude...am i really that screwed now?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Huh? What did you do?\n\n&gt; $Buddy: That raspi you had impounded...it was mine. But i have no idea what happened, i was at lunch. *turns out he was field-placed in that department* They gave it to me and said to write some code to poll info from some machines and display it on a screen. But why did you take it?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Duuuude...you plugged a DHCP server into my network. Most of the people in the building weren't able to work.\n\n&gt; $Buddy: Ouuuh, damn. It was already configured, i didn't know there was a DHCP server set up on it. Is it really going to go up the chain to my department lead?\n\n&gt; $Phrewfuf: Nope, that was just $FCM improvising. You can get your butt over here and pick it up.\n\nMeanwhile another colleague - he was already informed about this - was getting a call from the group lead of my buddy, asking what happened. It was like a sergeant chewing out a lieutenant. It's not something that should happen, but it did. And the best thing is that my colleague somehow talked that group lead into letting us have the raspi as a reimbursement for the time needed to fix the issue.\n\nIt's still in our office. We nuked the card and put a fresh image on it. It's now connected to the network and a huge flatscreen, displaying network traffic graphs.\n\n**TL;DR**: Someone tries to jump on the IoT bandwagon with a hunk of cement on his feet.\n\nEDIT: Clarification, why the server came back up despite the disabled port.\n\n*****\n\nPrevious Stories:\n\n* [Don't do the thing - Oops, i did the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4eqzlr/guys_dont_do_the_thing_it_breaks_stuff_oh_i_did/)\n\n* [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/)\n\n* [Personality issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ie176/netnotworking_personality_issues/)\n",

The questions are reasonable and can help him in resolving your issue faster than running up to see you. What issues are you specifically having?\n  \n$snowflake to bossman: \n&gt;  Regarding the phone, it is a hardware issue. I did not log a ticket as my previous request is still in the queue.\n&gt;  *I feel it's important to note, the previous request was about a printer issue*\n  \nIn the end, turns out $snowflake's phone did not hang up properly, needed a little shove to make it hang up. Replaced $snowflake's phone, redeployed the phone to someone who hangs up their calls more forcefully. \n  \nFollow-up: 2 months later, $snowflake comes back to me and says the phone's having issues. I emailed them to ask what issues now... and surprise, surprise, no response.\n  \nIt's just the \"I'm not IT\" that really gets me...and I have an awesome boss.",

        "text": "The current top post about mass emails reminded me of a job I used to have. To the guy who posted that one - I'm pretty sure I had your job, once.\n\nAnyway, for context. This was quite a number of years ago, now. Back when MailChimp was new, and self-serve mass email services were in their infancy. There were certain things they couldn't do, and that's where I came in. See, I worked for a company that built a more enterprise kind of competitor for MailChimp. In addition, we also offered custom email services; kind of the \"full-service\" alternative to our self-service software.\n\nThat \"full service\" option provided a bunch of minor benefits but, for the purposes of our story, the most important benefit was getting two sets of eyes from our company on QA and proofreading the email - the PM and developer were both expected to do this. The promised level of service in this regard was *extremely* high, and the consequences for letting a typo slip through were quite severe, for both the company (as written into the SLA) and for the dev and PM personally.\n\nSo one morning, I'm just sitting down at my desk to start work for the day, and the PM for Big Important Bank, one of our largest clients, comes over.\n\nPM: \"Hey. So you know that email that went out yesterday that you worked on? The client is saying that the logo is broken.\"\n\nWe share a *look*. This is bad. We both missed a broken graphic somehow, and we're gonna be in *trouble* because that's a bigger deal than a stupid little typo.\n\nMe: \"Okay. Let me take a look.\"\n\nThis is where I tell you that we, for various reasons, pretty much all ended up on the mailing lists of every customer we had. For ease and speed, I just logged into my own email account and went looking. I went to look at this email in Outlook, Thunderbird and on gmail's web service. It looked fine in all of them. \n\nMe: \"Uh. What email provider is causing this problem?\"\n\nPM: \"They're saying it's all of them, but clearly that isn't right. I'll go see if I can get more details.\"\n\nSo, while she's gone, I'm farting around on my computer, trying to find a combination of email provider and browser/software that's displaying the issue. I check everything, from LotusMail to Yahoo web mail on Opera. Even the various mobile options. It looks *fine*. I'm completely lost. It's a this point that I'm starting to wonder if the client is using like... IE 4 or something. It's the only thing I can think of.\n\nThat's what I get a message from the PM. She's been trying to walk through reproducing the problem with the client, but she can't figure it out. Normally, the devs aren't supposed to talk to the clients directly. This is all supposed to go through the PM, but she can't figure it out and the client is getting frustrated, so would I *pretty please* get on a conference call to see if I can make sense of what they're saying? I like this PM. She's good at her job and she treats the devs well. I'm happy to bend the rules a little for her, so I say sure.\n\nAnd yes, the moment I get on the call, I can tell the client is frustrated.\n\nClient: \"I can't believe this! *The logo is broken*. I don't know what's so difficult to understand about that!\"\n\nMe: \"Well sir, I'm sure you are aware that there are many logos on your emails. We're just trying to figure out which one is causing the problem so we can narrow down the cause and ensure that this never happens again.\"\n\nThe client starts grouching about how he wants us to *fix it* and the PM is stuck explaining that you can't fix an email that's already been sent. I get the impression this may be the third or fourth time this conversation she's had to explain this.\n\nMe: \"Sir, can you please explain to me exactly what you're doing when you encounter this broken logo?\"\n\nClient: *mumbling curses* \"I open the email, and then I *click the thing, and then the logo is broken.* It's simple! I don't understand how you are all this dense!\"\n\nMe: \"What... thing, sir?\"\n\nClient: \"**ANYTHING! IT ALL BREAKS THE LOGO!**\"\n\nThe PM goes back on damage control, while I stare at the screen, baffled. I'm looking at the email, and the logo is fine, and clicking on the email shouldn't change *anything*. I've never heard of this behaviour before. I start clicking randomly around the screen, trying to see what he's seeing. Nothing, nothing, nothing... then I accidentally smack of of the dozen and a half links on the email, and everything is clear. The logo on *their corporate website* is broken. \n\nMe: \"Um. Sir? That isn't our email. When you click a link on the email, it takes you to your website, where the logo is broken. We don't support your website.\"\n\nClient: \"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I OPENED THE EMAIL AND THE LOGO IS BROKEN SO ***OF COURSE IT'S THE EMAIL!!!***\"\n\nMeanwhile, the PM is staring at me from across the office (yay, open concept?), utterly baffled. I see her click a few things, and then I've never seen quite such a perfect face-palm as the one she gave at that moment. The client is still ranting furiously at me over the phone, but she cuts him off.\n\nPM: \"Thank you very much for you help, Fairwhether. I can handle it from here.\"\n\nI was no longer directly involved in that issue after that, but I did hear that they had to get the CEO of our company involved to deal with the client's SLA claim. At the very least, Big Important Bank seemed competently run, because as soon as our CEO started talking to the client contact's direct supervisor, we were given another client contact the very next day. So at least that's one happy ending: the nice PM wasn't forced to deal with someone who doesn't know the difference between an email and a website anymore!",

        "text": "*For the chronological list of tales, [look here!](https://redd.it/7i0esb)*\n\nGetting internet hooked up in Germany was an awful experience.  It’s so bad, in my opinion, that I feel like $BombBlast or $EventHorizion are responsible, responsive and quality companies in comparison. Because of living in a barracks room on base, I had only one option for internet: $WurstNet.  The process of getting them to hook you up was thus: \n\n1.\tSkate out of office early, prior to lunch\n\n2.\tDrive across town to the Post Exchange\n\n3.\tPray the staff is still in their little shack outside the exchange and didn’t go to lunch already\n\n4.\tSign up for internet and pay an advance and hookup fee\n\n5.\tWait 1-3 weeks for service technician to come out to turn it on.\n\nNeedless to say, the agony of getting access was not worth it to most people…and at 45 euro a month, it wasn’t exactly cheap.  Especially for a young Private First Class in the Army.   Luckily, my Roomate at the time ($KG—think Tenacious D) had already gone through all the agonizing trouble to get it set up.  He had even run a cable from the router, up through the drop ceiling of our room and put a drop in at my desk for me.  He charged me only 20 euro a month for it, so it was a pretty decent deal.  \n\nUnfortunately, $KG was not only a functional alcoholic, but also a pornography aficionado. By functional alcoholic, I mean he would be shaking by the end of the day and first thing he’d do when we got back to the room was slam a beer, put on his PTs and go for a run around the Kasserine perimeter.  And then proceed to get wasted for the rest of the night with a buddy while watching porn after porn after porn.  He wouldn’t do anything…just…stream it, download it, torrent it.  Limewire, bittorrent, you name it, he used it.   Explaining it to me once, he just said he *hated* living in Germany and wanted to be back in the states.  (Eventually he was stationed back home in New York and stopped drinking, cold turkey.)\n\nBeing as I…have my reasons for an extreme distaste in porn, I had arranged my desk to face away from his half of the room, we’d both created a sort of privacy wall with our wall lockers, and I wore headphones pretty much at all times.    I’m also a heavy gamer, so latency issues were the norm for me, but I powered through as my choices were rather limited on what else I could do.  \n\nEventually, $KG was promoted to Sergeant and because it was seen as a bit…improper to have an NCO living with a Private, he was moved downstairs to the NCO room in the barracks before being able to move out entirely to an apartment off-post.  Unfortunately, this meant we needed to get the internet swapped over to my name from his own, so that he could get it in his new room and later in his apartment.  The steps were about the same, except with some minor changes…\n\n1.\tSkate out of office early, prior to lunch\n\n2.\tDrive across town to the Post Exchange\n\n3.\tPray the staff is still in their little shack outside the exchange and didn’t go to lunch already\n\n4.\tRequest to transfer internet access owner\n\n5.\tCancel all internet service because policy/process\n\n6.\tSign up for internet and pay an advance and hookup fee\n\n7.\tService Technician shows up *immediately* to shut off access.\n\n8.\tWait 1-3 weeks for service technician to come out to turn it back on.\n\nSo a miserable two weeks later, internet returned and I actually took a look at the router.  Plugged into one of the network ports was my cable, the next held my new roommate’s cable, and then a third cable actually ran up to the window, through a hole in the screen and outside, down the roof, and over the side.  I had never paid attention to it before and went outside to see where it went.  The cable hung down to the second floor room directly below mine.  \n\nI went to $KG and asked him about the cable, and it was a friend of his who paid him 20 Euro a month for internet access as well.  I realized that between me and his friend, $KG was paying only 5 Euro a month for internet…and an Idea was born.\n\nTwo of the rooms next door were also asking about getting internet through me, so I ran the CAT5 through across the ceilings and into their rooms, and had them start paying me 20 Euro each.  Then I went and got myself a hub and ran more cables to either end of our floor, bringing in three more people and another 20 euro each.  \n\nAt one point, my Command Sergeant Major came in and saw my little network setup and cringed.  He actually had a degree in this stuff, and couldn’t believe I’d gone and wired up the third floor, especially in such a…*ghetto* fashion.  He kindly suggested I take everyone over to wireless, (and, I misquote: “Get those damn wires out of my ceilings”) but at this point no one had any wireless adapters and I wasn’t about to cut my revenue stream.  \n\nOf course, now I had upwards of 8 people on my little network and eating away at my gaming bandwith.  Especially since a couple of the guys absolutely *loved* to download music.    By this time, I was actually doing heavy WoW raiding with my guildies, working as a Molten Core Main Tank *druid* (in other words I was dedicating my life to it...) so I couldn’t afford any sort of...hindrances to my raid.  \n\nThe solution was quite simple and implemented rather judiciously, as I knew who the people were who were sucking up all the bandwith.  \n\n&gt;**Downloader**  “Hey man, my internet’s down!”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Ooh, sorry.  I’m not sure what’s happening, the internet is pretty awful and keeps cutting out.  I’ll see if I can figure out what I can do.”\n\nAnd as soon as he left…\n\n*alt-tab*\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Sorry for the interruption, guys, where were we?”\n\n**TL;DR:** I become $Bomblast\n\n",

        "text": "Hello everyone -- first-time poster, but not a particularly long-time lurker as I've only been reading this forum since July. I've only just joined Reddit, so please be patient as I learn the formatting rules!\n\n(And yes, my screen name is based on a certain evil genius from the world's longest-running science fiction TV series -- but I'm not *quite* that insane...)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've been a proper IT worker for only a few years now, and currently work on helpdesk; I'm probably the only helpdesk jockey who actually *likes* his job (partly due to working with professionals rather than the general public -- ecch!). Finally today I had something in this role worth writing about here -- but that'll have to wait for another day, as first, I'll post about something that happened six years ago...\n\nIt was a long road getting into IT, as for many years I was stuck as an office admin -- but in 2011, while working for a certain London borough council (whose name American readers might misread as the surname of Ralph and Alice in *The Honeymooners*), I became the unofficial liaison with the IT team for my section (part of children's social services). And this is why, one depressing day in December 2011, I helped guide the IT team... into the very jaws of Hell itself!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was gloomy due to it being a cold, dark, winter's day (and due to life issues that I won't go into here), and all I had was tedious audio typing to do -- so when the tall bloke from IT (I wonder if he's a member of this subreddit?) came to our basement office asking for help, I practically jumped out of my seat at the chance for a mini-adventure, helping the industry I one day hoped to join.\n\nHe was looking for a router (\"like the sort you have at home\"), apparently the source for the Internet connection in the public library upstairs in our building; it was getting increasingly flaky, and so needing onsite fixing.\n\nBeing new to the council, he didn't know where to find any of the server rooms; I, on the other hand, had been working in this mouldy, grimy basement for nearly three years, and knew my way around -- and so, with me in the lead, our expedition set off...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst port of call: a room down the hall, which turned out to have a disconnected and disused server rack inside (and an empty one next to it) -- so definitely not in there. We later cleared it out and turned it into a storage room for our own IT equipment (including the many laptops we had for our social workers), but not today.\n\nSecond was a server room next to one of our paper archives, from which in previous months could be heard a constant, incessant **beep-beep** sound, apparently indicating a UPS with a broken component. I nearly went mad working in the archive while that was going on, and IT took ages to fix it... but that room also didn't contain the malfunctioning router.\n\nWhere could it be? Ah, I recalled: when I joined my team in the basement back in March 2009, we'd needed a whole new phone line networked in, so I could have a phone on my desk. I'd followed the IT bloke around that day, as he tried to work out which server room it was done in, and remembered the room we'd finally found: it was on the ground floor, but could only be reached via stairs from the basement.\n\nHaving confirmed the location, we had to get a key from security at reception on the ground floor -- but with that in hand, we descended to the basement, found the stairs, went back up to the ground floor, crept through a twisty-turny passage to this seldom-visited server room, unlocked and opened the door, went inside...\n\nAnd plunged through a wall of intense heat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomehow, all the aircon units in this server room had been set to **hot** mode, each pouring out boiling air -- and it was now so stifling in there that we couldn't stay inside for even a minute at a time, before being driven out for the sake of our health! We couldn't even find the library router, if it was even in there -- we just had to get the hell out of, er, *hell*, and let security know the problem.\n\nSadly I never found out how this had happened (and whether it affected any other network services in the council at the same time) -- but, to quote the movie *Dagon*, there are two possibilities:\n\n- Since some aspects of our building's aircon was controlled from a *completely different building* (twenty minutes' walk away, on a major London road), it's not impossible that someone mistakenly flicked the server room's hot/cold switch, while trying to change a different aircon section to hot (due to it being winter), not realising the damage they'd be causing in our building. However...\n\n- Since it felt like the freestanding aircon units on the floor were also set to \"hot\" mode, it's also possible that someone, perhaps in IT itself, having handed in (or been handed) his notice, decided his parting gift to the council would be... sabotage!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYears later (when I was taking voluntary redundancy, and the service was being moved to a new building), I heard they were decommissioning the equipment in that server room and taking it away. I wish I could have watched... how much of it was being taken out in the form of solidified pools of metal?\n\nEdit: formatting (section spacing) -- hope it's less like a wall of text now!",

The files has a bit more info than the paper version and contains 50+ columns. \n\n&gt; **Me**: Hello, IT. How may I help you?\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: I've printed your worksheet and it prints one part on one sheet, and another part on another, and again another. It's unreadable.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Well, it's not exactly intended to just print out like that.\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: It prints out in 14 pages or something. \n\nThis time I tried telling her that I'm not getting paid to explain to teach her how Excel works or how she can adjust the printer settings. Mildred used ignore. It was super effective.\n\n&gt; **Me**: If you really need to print it, you'll have to do some adjustments. What software are you using?\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: myschool.edu\n\n&gt; **Me**: That's a website. \n\nWhy did I even ask? And why did think I could explain this rocket science level stuff over the phone? I'm clearly not thinking straight anymore when I have her on the phone. \n\nI told her that we could start up teamviewer and she started dictating her ID before I even finished my sentence. It's our ritual now. \n\nIt turns out that she already opened the print preview in Excel again. I gave her a short lesson in Excel. How to hide columns or adjust their width, those kind of basic actions. \n\n&gt; **Mildred**: Will I have to do this every time? \n\n&gt; **Me**: Yes.\n\n&gt; **Mildred**: *sigh*\n\nI could say I'm sorry, but I would be lying.

You know the ones:  \n\n* The guy who bought $20 worth when it was just a few cents and is now a multi millionaire.\n\n* The guy who had a bajillion coins mined on a PC that went up in smoke (or the hard drive died or the house burnt down or his ex-girlfriend destroyed it).\n\n* The poor sucker had his coins in Mt Gox, and would be a \"Very Rich Person Indeed\" if it wasn't shut down.\n\n* The guy who gave his family paper wallets with 5 BTC for christmas in years gone by, the family lost them / used them to line the bird cages, and now it's *his fault* that they don't have untold riches now.\n\nI thought that one a coworker told me today would be a good fit for this subreddit.  Overall story is the same as I was told, just anonymised and posted with permission.\n\nInvolved:\n\n**$CW** = my current co-worker\n\n**$SmallCo** – A smallish business with &lt;15 employees.\n\n**$Bossman** for the boss of a $SmallCo\n\n**$Old_IT** for the old IT guy that used to work at $SmallCo\n\n\n$CW was brought into $SmallCo on an emergency contract basis, apparently due to $Old_IT being terminated for “performance reasons” before $SmallCo could find a new permanent IT guy.  $CW quickly found out through office gossip that the performance had to do with some inappropriate behaviour involving a young office admin and a lot of alcohol, and avoiding a lawsuit.\n\n$CW was tasked by $Bossman to ensure that there was “no way they could get hacked by $Old_IT” ($Bossman was apparently a good dude with zero technical skills).  \n\n&gt; “While you’re at it” said $Bossman, “fix what’s making that godawful sound in the closet.”\n\n$CW set to work securing what he could - ensuring that all passwords (including admin) were changed site-wide, dealing with vendors and suppliers to to let them know $Old_IT was no longer allowed to make changes, changed the entry codes for doors to offices and server rooms, and just general security practices you do when you terminate a SysAdmin.  Then $CW started the hardware audit.\n\n(At this point $CW paused in his story - he’d heard tales of SysAdmins who set up automated scripts that would nuke all systems if admin passwords were changed, but hadn't considered this before his updates.  Thankfully, none of those malicious scripts were found, but he says he was sweating bullets when he remembered *after* changing everything.)\n\nWhat $CW did find instead was \n\n* a large trove of amazing documentation (both online /O365 and in physical folders on $Old_IT’s desk), \n\n* network points with proper labeling, \n\n* excellent cable management throughout the offices and properly laid out *and in accordance with* the network diagram, \n\n* printers and computers with proper asset tags, \n\n* detailed records of assets in the register, \n\n* units with recent and regular electrical test-and-tags.  \n\n\nThe works.  It was heaven.\n\n\nThe servers in the “server room” (in reality a closet but with proper ventilation) were clearly labelled with the server name, IP, and with the purpose (DB server, mail server, etc) and all with pretty awesome r/cableporn worthy management.\n\n\nIt took $CW barely two hours to make sure all the hardware matched the documentation.\n\n\nExcept ... for this one machine in the server room.  A big sucker, an extra wide base that looked out of place compared to the sleek machines in the room.  The specific unit was the one that $Bossman had pointed out, and it was *indeed* making a terrible racket.  No asset labels, no server information, no documentation, nothing indicating its purpose in the world other than to be noisy as hell.  $CW tried plugging in keyboard and monitor but was unable to get anything he connected to respond, and no rogue IP on the network that could help him ID the purpose.   No-one had any ideas what it did, so he performed a Scream Test.  \n\nOr at least he tried to - because he could not gracefully shut down (no monitor/keyboard would work) he simply tried the old \"press the power button for 10 seconds\" (the IT equivalent of trying to smother it with a pillow).  \n\nWhen that didn’t work he said a small prayer, yanked the power cord from the back, and hoped that whatever happened to the machine it was not permanent.  He then found that the networking for the unit did not run to the switches or business grade router for the office, but was plugged into a cunningly hidden (but consumer grade) second router, with the excellent cable management that matched the rest of the office.\n\nThe requisite 1 week period passed, and no screams.  $CW found himself with little to do, so he took another look at this mystery machine.  He tried plugging the power back in and powering it up, but there was only silence.\n\n$CW, thinking he had killed this little server forever, obtained permission from $Bossman to open up the box and perform last rites.  At the least he could pull the drive and work out what the system actually did, at worst he could cannabalise what he could and possibly build a new box for the business.\n\nFor those of you boys and girls paying attention, you’ve already guessed when $CW found, but I'm obviously thick and would never have guessed in a million years.\n\n$CW found inside a box that was bereft of the normal computer or server gear you’d find in any kind of server -  no Motherboard, no RAM, no drives, nothing but a power supply and some fans.  Instead he found an older generation ASIC miner (I’ll leave you guys to google this yourselves for the full details, but short version is “Awesome Bitcoin Miner”) with the miner and the fans on the box the only things connected to the power supply.  \n\nThe network cable ran *into* the box, and connected to the miner directly.  All external buttons or connections on the tower proper were not actually connected to the internal workings.  Power came from the wall to the power supply and straight to the miner.  The only way to turn it on or off was inside the box itself.\n\n$CW, being an honest person (much much more honest than I ever could be!), showed what he found $Bossman, explained what it was for, and advised to get the company lawyer involved, possibly the police just to be safe.  $Bossman still didn't fully comprehend what was happening other than “$Old_IT was stealing electricity from $SmallCo”, but promised that at the end of that process, if $CW wanted the unit, he could have it.\n\n$Bossman reckons the noisy server had been there for over a year.\n\n$SmallCo found a new permanent IT guy soon after, because while $CW was good he was expensive (contractor rates) and other than the miner discovery $CW was bored.  He still hasn’t heard back if he can get his hands on the miner yet, but last he heard $SmallCo was taking $Old_IT to court for the harassment and other items.\n\nConsidering how thorough $Old_IT was with everything else in the office, we're contending that he’d have backups of the crypto wallets in safe places, but it's still gotta hurt when you lose your job and your side income simultaneously.\n\n**TL;DR – Coworker found a strange box, filled with magical internet money!**",

        "text": "First, this is only my second post. Be gentle, I still have scars that are healing from my last story.    \nSecond, this sadly isn't your typical TFTS story. In fact this isn't much of a story at all as it is a rant. This just occurred today a bit ago, so I'm still somewhat heated over it, probably for no real reason; as the saying goes, not my circus not my monkeys. Enjoy!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMikMik91 works at your friendly neighborhood 'Redacted Inc'. You see, it really is a wonderful place to work; you got Bob from accounting, he's such a comedian, always having some kind of joke to cheer up your day. You have Jill from Sales, she's always so fun and perky to be around, hard to have a bad day with her.     \nThen there's Nikky from the floor.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou see, Nikky has a special nickname: 'Needy Nikky'. She worked hard to earn that nickname too. Always calling up MikMik91 on the radio or via Lync to ask for help under the table or to bypass some pesky policy. MikMik91 generally has no problem doing such things. He works the night shift so he understands there's no time for red-tape for some things and doesn't mind looking the other way within reason, but he is sure to not be taken advantage of; some of those policies ARE a little silly.    \n&amp;nbsp;\nSo it wasn't too out of the norm to see Nikky request somebody look at her laptop, it was running way hotter than normal.\n&gt;*Fair enough of a request* **MikMik91 thought,**  *It's probably just an unplugged or broken CPU fan. Easy fix.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMikMik91 was currently ~~not wanting to be bothered with that and walk over to the user~~ on a ticket already and was unable to be of assistance, however advised the user to head on over to one of his other coworkers who can gladly assist. Off Needy Nikky went to be taken care of! Or so MikMik91 thought...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo, User didn't want her fan replaced. She not only got *her* manager to approve on the ticket -which MikMik91 thought might be slightly odd but on the off chance we had to order a replacement fan MAYBE that's why- She got **MikMik91's** manager to approve as well on the ticket. What's more? She was personally texting MikMik91's manager during the whole conversation talking him into upgrading her from her from an Hp g1 640 to a g2 640. ***FURTHERMORE***, She also talked him into a RAM upgrade as well.    \n&amp;nbsp;\nNow, you're probably wondering why this is relevant or problematic. You see, MikMik91 services many computers. From Thin clients, to laptops, to full fledged desktops, to SFF desktops. In the past, Mikmik91 has tried to perform RAM upgrades for various machines, more specifically the slowest of the slow machines that would benefit from it and people use on daily basis for day-to-day work. He was told that \"General slowness and 10-15 minutes to open critical work applications and files\" is not valid excuse for RAM upgrades; However Needy Nikky manages to talk his manager into not only procuring a new laptop, but a RAM upgrade to go with it. Did MikMik91 mention the newer G2 laptops come with SSD already coming from mechanics on the G1? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***TL;DR*** If your Fan goes out, don't replace it. Throw the whole laptop out and get a new one.\n\nAlso, Tune in next week when MikMik91 drops a sev1 ticket for a zbook laptop cuz his RAM isn't properly seated. /s",
