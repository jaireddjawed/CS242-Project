We have been together for 5 years and I am curious what other students experiences are. Do you find school to get in the way? Do you find you’re too burnt out during this time in your life to maintain a serious relationship/ dating? I know his priority will be school and I want that for him. I’m just trying to picture how my life will be the next four-eight years. All thoughts appreciated",

I have a strong feeling that ranking EM above prelim surgery will match me into EM and cut surgery out completely. \n\nAny advice is welcomed! Super stressed.",

I realize now as I am looking at journals to publish in, it is basically required. The patient has long been discharged and I'm on a different rotation now (this is from 2 months ago).\n\nSo my question is this: this patient presented with their family, which included a person that works at the hospital, whom I see often. I am not acquainted with this person, but I did interact with them when caring for the patient. Would it be appropriate to approach this person to kindly ask if they would be willing to ask the patient on my behalf if they would be okay with the case report and ask them to give them the consent form to sign, or is that very inappropriate?",

        "text": "I’m an MS3 struggling with the specialty decision. I went in to school with work experience alongside anesthesia for 2 years doing arterial/central lines and nerve blocks, perfusion related things during cardio/vascular cases etc. as well as exposure to rural family medicine and the breadth of their practice through family. They feel very separate and I cannot make any progress on a decision.\n\nGeneral considerations: \n- I haven’t loved any one thing in medicine, but I’ve liked almost everything (IM and anesthesia &gt;&gt; peds and surgery &gt;&gt; psych OB neuro, have not done FM yet). \n- I really don’t care for prestige or research or fellowships, could live with or without a fellowship\n- I would not want to work terribly long hours or take a bunch of call, I value family time and personal life over work \n- I would look for work in a more rural area - max population is 50-100k but prefer 10-25k. Super important to return to smaller area\n- I like both OR and clinic - OR is more intellectually stimulating and interesting during my rotations and work, but clinic is more relaxed and get to talk with patients and establish relationships which I enjoy and feel that I really excel here\n- I enjoy variety and balance. Would not want to do one thing all day every day\n- My fiancé is applying OB, going to couples match\n\nAnesthesia pros:\n- I love physiology and pharmacology, i feel like I understand these concepts. I got my degree in mathematics before school so I am attracted to a more math and problem solving focused area.\n- Intellectually stimulating while also getting to work with my hands\n- Broad scope of practice\n- Better pay\n- Minimal paperwork/charting\n\nCons:\n- Can be high stress at times\n- Likely more call/overnights/holidays/weekends than FM\n- no continuity. I enjoy talking with and getting to know patients\n- Unsure of what role anesthesiologists play in more rural areas with CRNAs. Likely will have more managerial role in this setting\n\nRural FM pros:\n- Huge scope of practice, get to see all ages and could do small office procedures\n- balance of clinic + inpatient + maybe ER, which I would like\n- Continuity, get to know patients more and “be their doctor”\n\nCons:\n- Paperwork and dealing with insurance sucks\n- Chronic disease management and noncompliant patients and other difficult social situations would be tiring and feel like a drag\n- Bringing work home, separating work and personal life in smaller community\n\nMy brain tells me anesthesia but my heart tells me FM. Are there any other specialties I might fit in with well? Any help would be appreciated!",

My colleagues outside the hospital have been really supportive.\n\nThe questions I have is does anyone have or know anyone who transitioned M3/M4 year? does any of this have to be disclosed? outside of obvious bias, is it something brought up in interviews and can negatively impact you?

Any insight would be much appreciated.\n\nWhen ERAS was due, I was pretty certain that I would end up choosing psychiatry, but figured I would also apply FM since I already had all the LORs, etc. At that point FM was more of a back up for me. Fast forward to the end of interview season and I really enjoyed my interviews for both FM and psych (as much as one can actually enjoy an interview), but was still thinking psych was the winner.\n\nNow, I'm doing a integrative medicine rotation where I've been able to shadow FM docs who did a fellowship in integrative med and incorporate that learning into their practice which I love and is making me rethink my specialty choice.\n\nIn Psychiatry, I really love outpatient psych, seeing bread and butter cases like anxiety and depression. I like that I get to know patients well and have longer appointment times. I like that residency is a little less intense and that I can have a future job without any call if I so choose. I also really like the vibe of psych offices - way less of a sterile feel to them. Some hesitations I have are managing acute psychotic patients and going through the inpatient psych rotations that are required in residency where most patients feel like they are \"in a prison\" (as many have told me on rotations). I also think about patients with real physical complaints such as GI distress who may present to a psych outpatient office but instead of doing any real workup or lab tests, I may be limited to just dealing with their mental health and have to refer them back to their PCP for any other labs.\n\nWith FM I like the thought of doing an integrative medicine fellowship and utilizing that in practice to treat patients in a holistic manner. I would still get to see bread and butter psych cases, but I would also have to deal with everything else as well. I also worry about burnout in FM, and it would take a lot of work on my end to negotiate 30 min visits for patients rather than the typical 15-20 min. However, I do like that I would utilize all the knowledge from medical school and be able to get at the root cause for patient's mental health issues such as gut dysbiosis, etc.\n\nPlease help!",

Over the past year or so I feel like I’ve completely lost interest in medicine. I know a large part of this is burnout but another part is just being around so many hyper competitive personalities. It’s also hard seeing my non-medical friends have so much fun going out, traveling, spending time with friends/family, and just generally having a great time while I’ve been working and studying for what seems like 3.5 years straight. \n\nI personally am not able to buy into the “sacrifice it all to be a doctor” mindset nor am I a masochist who can continue to keep grinding just for the sake of grinding. Med school has been incredible difficult for me (I’m not a fast learner) and I’m currently studying for Step 1 which is brutal and seems impossible. \n\nI feel like before med school I used to be a much more fun person with a great social list and so many hobbies and this career has taken all that from me. I wouldn’t say that I’m depressed but just that this career has really decreased my quality of life. Maybe that’s to be expected but I just don’t think we should have to be miserable to become doctors. I guess I’m just wondering how others have dealt with these feelings. Any support and suggestions for a positive mindshift would be greatly appreciated!",

I received a 262 on step 2, and with the score jump, I managed to hone some great studying and exams taking skills that helped me with the score improvement, which I would be happy to share with you as well! \n\nI high passed every clerkship and honored one. I became well versed in taking shelf exams and would like to assist you with this as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very flexible and can meet any day of the week, and am very flexible with my timings. I can meet virtually or in person. I am happy to meet with any student, both here in the USA and international as well.

I don't even know if this is possible, but as an embedded designer I've been thinking about it.\n\nThe idea is to use a contact lenses that contains a microchip with a camera. The camera would then encode this data in a format the optic nerve understands (impossible?), and wirelessly transmit that data to the nerves so the undamaged part of the optic nerves receive the signals (impossible?).\n\nThere's so much that is impossible with this idea. Sourcing a microchip small enough for one, sourcing a camera small enough, and can nerves be exploited in this way where they can receive data wirelessly? I've read research that suggests nerves can communicate in this way, not sure if it applies to the optic nerves.\n\nHas anything like this been discussed or attempted? I'd like to dig deeper, and would love some discussion around this. I plan to work in the medical field when I've completed my electronics engineering degree.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Was talking with someone at another med school who told me one of the classes was requesting that \\*all\\* their psych lectures and didactics come with a trigger warning. There are specific topics for which I personally appreciate trigger warnings, and I can recall an instance where a picture was shown that was completely unexpected from the lecture title and I really wish there had been a warning for that one. I also recognize that people have different triggers, and there are some easy examples of topics that should generally have trigger warnings. But on the other hand, I don't think every lecture needs a trigger warning (unless they want people writing \"trigger warnings: none\" on the first slide). Also, a lecture about suicide is obviously a lecture about suicide and will be triggering for some people. Isn't that evident from the title? Should a trigger warning be included on the first slide that says \"trigger warnings: suicide, self-harm, death?\" Friends and I have specifically reached out to faculty in advance, or just to each other for support, prior to lecture topics we expected to be difficult. We were also told at the beginning of psych that we could take a moment to leave during any lecture that was too much. That seemed more useful to me than simply slapping a trigger warning on everything. I think trigger warnings are most helpful when they are for something unexpected or something that is more likely to be impactful (eg video, picture, individual stories/cases). \n\nI've also heard attendings say medicine is triggering and patients don't come with trigger warnings. Which is weird because I understand where they're coming from but it also evokes a bit of that \"back in my day\" vibes. Violent patients and people with past history of abusing or cussing out staff typically come with a warning. But, yeah, you will absolutely see some harrowing things in medicine, regardless of specialty, and while sometimes leaving the room to excuse yourself is an option, other times you can't do that.\n\nI think my overall opinion is that there are situations where trigger warnings are appropriate and probably even necessary, but rubber stamping every lecture with a trigger warning seems to me a bit much. What do you think? What do your schools do?",
