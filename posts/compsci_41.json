This is the data flow of what I’m thinking:\nTwitter Stream API —&gt; Flume —&gt; HDFS —&gt; \nSpark/MapReduce —&gt; Some database. I would like the Twitter data to be real time streamed but don’t know how I would actually store it. Also, I was thinking of using an ec2 instance to host my Hadoop/HDFS But I don’t want to spend a lot of money for the amount of compute and run time of that instance. Does this make sense and/or possible in terms of data flow and architecture? Would I be spending a lot of money for my ec2 instance for running Hadoop on it? \nI’ve been thinking about this project a lot lately and I’m having a hard time just getting my requirements right.

        "text": "Deterministic finite automata are awesome. Simple to explain, quite expressive given enough states, and have lots of practical applications. However, they are not able to express how quantum computing works quite as easily.\n\nThe problem is the quantum variants require the use of complex numbers to describe their state (which means you must have knowledge about real analysis, at least, to formally reason about these automata).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Is there any way to replace the complex numbers that appear in quantum finite automata with something discrete and still maintain the same power?\n\n2) Could the same technique be used for the probabilistic finite automata that use real numbers?\n\n3) How come these automata can use complex numbers and yet still seem to be fairly weak in deciding languages? Isn't the set of real numbers way bigger than the set of computable numbers?\n\nI'm trying to learn how quantum computing works and the model that I follow is the one described on the wiki of quantum state machines, that is: have state as a vector of quantum probability distribution and the transition function as a set of unitary matrices.\n\nThe math itself is rather easy but having uncountable numbers in describing state machines seems excesive.",

He does love gaming but does get into the coding side of things - it's not something I have a great deal of knowledge about. \n\nI'd love to get him a book about the history of computer science. A lot of books I see recommended seem to be for those in the industry or graduates - he's a bright kid but I don't want to get him something that may be a bit too technical.\n\nIf anyone can recommend something digestible for a teenager about the subject I would be grateful.\n\nMany thanks\n\nEdit: When I posted this I was hoping for one or two useful suggestions. Honestly, the enthusiasm here is very humbling and I wish that the subreddits I lurk on (like r/guitar for example) showed as much joy and excitement for the subject - especially for complete laymen like me. Hell, the joy you all seem to have for the subject leaves me tempted to start reading! My Dad taught VME for ICL back in the day (now Fujitsu) and it'd have been nice to converse with him and my son about these things. \n\nThis thread could be a fabulous resource for any other parent with the same dilemma.\n\nOnce again, thank you so so much for all your input and kind words.\n\nI hope everyone here has a wonderful Christmas. Thanks to your contribution I will be able to give my son something a bit more meaningful this year.",

Every time they want to pick up a piece of cutlery to eat, they must toss a coin. Heads = pick up a fork first, tails = pick up a knife first. Further, if the cutlery next to them is taken, they are free to reach around the table and grab any free cutlery. Is this deadlock free?\n\nI was discussing it with a friend and we've reached the conclusion (so far) that if 3 people flip a heads and 3 people flip a tails at the same time, each person will have one piece of cutlery and will be waiting for another, in other words, a deadlock. Is this train of thought correct or are we wildly off track? Thanks!",
