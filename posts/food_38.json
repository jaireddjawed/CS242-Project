        "text": "I'm reposting only to have everything that happened written here in my profile, since this post was deleted by mods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm  a Chinese born woman, he is from Spain and we live in a western  country. We have a 3 year relationship, sometimes he is quick to snap  and be rude to people, but I always saw the good things he has. However,  his family came to visit him for the first time in many years, it was  his mom, dad, sister and 12yo nephew. I accommodated all of them in my  place, but when I arrived from work they were already there, and the  nephew did the eye stretching as soon as he saw me.\n\nIt  was followed by many racists joked from the nephew, and my boyfriend  did nothing. In the morning of the 25th they asked me to make Chinese  food because the nephew wanted Chinese food, so I did it, but I made  real Chinese food, and they were disappointed and went to a restaurant.\n\nMy  boyfriend insulted me, called me stupid, and that I should have known  what they meant by Chinese food. The family went back to Spain on the  27th, but while they were still here, started talking to me as a  toddler, and my BF said it was my fault.\n\nI'm  very sad, and stressed, and disappointed, I've never seen him being  this rude to me and he never insulted me that much. I'm still trying to  make him understand how I'm feeling, but he says I'm stupid for being  offended by jokes made by a child. I dont really know how to communicate  my feelings and how his family made me feel.\n\nTLDR:  My boyfriend's family has been very racist in their Christmas visit,  and he defends them and insults me, I dont know how to make him  understand my feelings.",

        "text": "Hi, it's me, I'm alive, Im sorry for disappearing for so long. A lot has happened in the last weeks. Sorry if I'm not very detailed, I'm very tired today.\n\nFor those who already know my story, my boyfriend allowed his family to be racist to me. After his family left, I tried to break up with him, but he wouldn't let me end the relationship, I tried talking to him but he would say something along the lines of \"I'm not breaking up with you\".\n\nI talked to my family about it, they were furious at him and I had their support, specially my father. I'm so glad that they were by my side.\n\nI went to my place with my father to confront my boyfriend and break up once and for all. He didn't take it will, shouted that I can't break up with him and he wont end the relationship, that's where my dad intervened and they started fighting, like... fist fighting. My dad ended up being hurt but he also landed some punches on my boyfriend, I was horrified, crying, screaming and with no idea of what to do. My BF then grabbed me, got my purse and took me out, my dad followed me. My keys and phone where in the purse so I couldn't go back in. He locked himself and we started hearing him breaking stuffs. \n\nThen dad called the police. They arrived like half an hour later, during that entire time he did hear him breaking stuffs. When the cops finally arrived tried to talk to him but wouldn't respond, so they broke the door and after another fight they arrested him.\n\nI walked in my place with another cop and my dad and everything was destroyed. Everything he could break was broken, from glasses to plates to mirrors to holes in the walls, every TV, my computer, my phone, coffee maker, etc. Dad pressed charges immediately.\n\nI was terrified, and I'm still terrified. We had a trial and he is in jail now, but I think he might be deported to spain, I'm not sure.\n\nI'm still in therapy and still living with my parents. Some of my stuffs were repaid but I'm still not ready to come back home. Sometimes I still wake up crying in the middle of the nigh. I dont know if I regret standing up for myself, or if I will be able to trust people in the future, I might die alone without a husband or children and that makes me sad. I had suicidal thoughts but I find things that make me want to stay alive. \n\nI dont know when will I feel good for real, but progress has been made.\n\nOh, and my ex-BF's family are still trying to reach me to insult me and make me feel even worst for sending him to jail. I block them but always find yet another phone number to call me from or a temporary mail address. \n\nIf you are reading this, thank you.",
