Is the article \"the\" required here?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)  I believe that the graduate program at X University will broaden as well as deepen my understanding of technology as a software engineer, in turn helping me realize my objectives and connect with my core values.**\n\n( Is the prepositional phrase \"as a software engineer\" in the right place? Is it misplaced by any chance? )\n\n(Additionally, is there an issue with the participle clause here \"in turn helping me realize....\"? Since the first sentence already has a noun clause, is the participle clause a dangling modifier?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)  Although my university did not offer any interdisciplinary finance courses, I did not give up; instead, I poured my time and effort into learning financial and valuation analysis and the basics of accounting and credit rating.**\n\n(Can't say whether \"instead\" is needed here or not)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4) Indeed, surmounting the technical and domain-based hurdles to deliver an interdisciplinary major project has been a valuable experience; accomplishing my long-term goals, nevertheless, demands a commitment to the future of computer technology: artificial intelligence.**\n\n(Should it be \"the technical and domain-based hurdles to deliver a...\", or is the article \"the\" not required here?)\n\n (Also, is adding an adverb in between problematic? For consider: \"surmounting the technical and domain-based hurdles to deliver an interdisciplinary major project successfully has been a valuable experience\". Is the adverb \"successfully\" fine here?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5) Nonetheless, advancements in computer science, finance, or any other domain, for that matter, I maintain, should not come at the expense of reinforcing bias, prejudice, and inequality.**\n\n(Is something wrong with this sentence? Does \"for that matter\" upset the grammar in any manner?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6) To gain a firm footing for my graduate studies, I worked towards accumulating relevant industry experience after the completion of my undergraduate program.**\n\n(\"the relevant experience\" or \"relevant experience\"? And would you rephrase the above sentence differently?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7) Moreover, the success of my friend, \\[name\\], as a graduate student at X University—who is also scheduled to pursue his Ph.D. at X university—has been a great source of inspiration.**\n\n(Is the adjective clause \"who is also scheduled to...\"  modifying the right noun? I am a little confused here.)\n\n(If nothing is wrong here, is there a simpler way to write this sentence?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8) Working as part of a dedicated team to implement an event-driven architecture—where we implemented cloud-native event streaming and messaging with Apache Kafka and Spring Cloud Stream to asynchronously consume as well as publish data—has been the apex of my career.** \n\n(Is the sentence between the em dashes modifying the right thing?

I’m using a new program/app to check previous chapters of my novel. Pro Writing Aid, so far, is a big improvement to my old standby despite its flaws. Well, it recently flagged an “unusual dialogue tag” in a chapter. The weird bit? There is literally no dialogue in that entire chapter. There’s one instance of a thought-in-single-quotes, but the sentence begins and ends in quotation marks with no tag following. I’ve altered a couple of words to maintain privacy—I’m writing this novel under a different pen name from this account—but this is the gist of the only line of dialogue:\n           _A chill skittered down his spine. ‘Does that man never leave?’ [end of paragraph, next paragraph starts with the word _for._\nThere _are_ instances of descriptive verbs elsewhere in the chapter which might be mistaken for, and can be used as, unusual dialogue tags.   (scoffed, worried, questions, answers, wished, demanding, requests, wondered, etc.) None of those words are used in connection to any sort of dialogue, spoken or internal, only narration of actions or exposition.\n\nSo, my question. Is _any_ verb used for making noise with your mouth—such as _called, cried, sputtered,_ etc.—considered a dialogue tag even if it isn’t used with dialogue, or are these words being flagged because of a bug in the app?",

        "text": "Hello all. I'm sort of wrapping my head around grammatical functions and diagramming them out in a sentence. That is to say, Subject, Object (Direct or Indirect), Complement, Modifier, etc. One way I practice these to grab a nearby book and pick sentences at random, then try to label their constituents. I think the biggest issue I'm having is telling the difference between complements and objects, and also in figuring out what parts go where in longer sentences. The first sentence I found seemed easy enough: \n\n**The Temple of Jerusalem is a roughly rectangular structure, some five hundred meters long and three hundred meets wide, balanced atop Mount Moriah, on the Eastern Edge of the holy city.** \n\nIn this case it appears that \"*The Temple of Jerusalem\"* is the Subject noun phrase, \"*is\"* is the predicate verb, and that whole mess of a sentence thereafter is the complement, because it's information that is required by the verb \"is\", lest the sentence just be \"The Temple of Jerusalem is\". Okay, fair enough. The next sentence, though: \n\n**For a fee, the money changers will exchange your foul foreign coins for the Hebrew Shekel, the only currency permitted by the Temple authorities.** \n\nNow I'm lost. \n\nMy best guess is so far is that \"*For a fee\"* is a Modifier (specifically a prepositional phase maybe?), \"*the money changers\"* is the subject, *\"will exchange\"* is the predicate verb (assuming that auxiliaries and regular verbs count as one in this area?), and then it all falls apart. Is *\"your foul foreign coins\"* the indirect object and *\"the Hebrew Shekel\"* the direct object, or vice-versa? Where does the word \"for\" between those objects fit in there? Is it a complement of \"will exchange\"? Is \"exchange\" a complement of \"will\" and I don't even have the verb right? And is that appositive \"the only currency permitted by the temple authorities\" a modifier technically, or some other object thing? \n\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated. I can't tell if I'm just overthinking it or if I just am confronting the fact that I really don't have that strong of a grasp on modifiers, direct objects, and indirect objects.",

        "text": "\n\nI’m part of a team that’s contributing to a formal report. The report’s discussion includes a handful of project-specific terms that, as far as I know, shouldn’t be capitalized unless it refers to a specific instance of that term.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \nFor example: \n&gt; Project implementation was governed by *local neighbourhood committees* that often had incompatible priorities. For example, the *Ohio Local Neighbourhood Committee* preferred their bread butter-side up, whereas the *Maine Local Neighbourhood Committee* preferred theirs butter-side down.   \n\n   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \nThis is just a made-up example to represent a range of situations. Keep in mind that these aren’t just random or casual groups of people getting together in neighbourhoods, they’re formal bodies established under the project. Also keep in mind that the reports relate to a large, sprawling institution so there are numerous situations like this with names of different lengths. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \nMost collaborators capitalize “local neighbourhood committees.” I think the rationale is that because it’s a set of words that aren’t typically used as a pronoun, capitalizing them signals to the reader to treat the words as a collection/group that refers to a specific item. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \n\n&gt;project implementation was governed by Local Neighbourhood Committees that often had incompatible priorities. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \nMy understanding (which could be wrong) is that this is technically incorrect, but my intuition agrees with the treatment. In many cases it’s not necessarily clear from context or other places in the text that these are specific things. Compare to something like “Most local projects are governed by a steering committee.”    \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \nThe only workaround I’ve thought of is using single quotes to set the item off, but whether or not that would be correct, they add a distracting hiccup to the overall flow (italicizing the terms had a similar effect). \n   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n \nAm I wrong that generic references to things shouldn’t be capitalized? If so, how ‘bad’ of an issue is it? These are formal reports, but there is some flexibility in that if a stylized approach is better, deviations are acceptable if they’re done consistently.",

        "text": "There's a bit of a debate going on right now among swifties (fans of Taylor Swift) over the interpretation of a certain lyric. Some insist that there are two grammatically correct ways to interpret it, while others maintain there is only one. While I understand that song lyrics have important differences from other forms of writing, I still thought it would be interesting to get the perspective of some fellow grammar nerds! \n\nThe lyric in question is: \n\n&gt;Bet I could still melt your world  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Argumentative, antithetical dream girl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interpretation 1:** The lyric contains an implied/removed\\* [vocative comma](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/vocative-comma-guide), which helps identify who the author is addressing (in this case, the \"dream girl\"). With unnecessary adjectives removed, the lyric should be read as:\n\n&gt;I could still melt your world, dream girl.\n\n\\*For context, commas that would otherwise occur at the end of a line break are removed in song lyrics ([source](https://artists.apple.com/support/1111-lyrics-guidelines)). So it's possible the line was broken due to length and the vocative comma was removed. Additionally, every line is capitalized in song lyrics, so there's no special meaning there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interpretation 2:** The author is referring to herself as the “dream girl.\" The lyric contains an implied subject (I), verb (am), adjective (your), and either an implied conjunction (because) or a period. With unnecessary adjectives removed, the lyric should be read as:\n\n&gt;I could still melt your world because I’m your dream girl.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;   OR  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I could still melt your world. I'm your dream girl. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFWIW, I asked my Mom, who was an HS English teacher for many years, about this. She said (of the 2nd interpretation) \"You're jumping over the obvious meaning to infer an entirely new sentence based on nothing. There's no evidence that the noun \\[girl\\] doesn't belong in this sentence. That's not a valid interpretation of what's on the page.\"  Tbh, that was an even stronger rebuke than I was expecting haha. \n\n# What does r/grammar think though - which interpretations are grammatically valid? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note on lyrics vs other forms of writing: This thought experiment helped me as well: If I were tasked with transcribing this from spoken word to text, I would have to add words that the speaker **did not say** to arrive at a sentence where she is referring to herself as the \"dream girl.\" In contrast, I would only have to add a comma (which I imagine is a fairly normal practice in transcription when the speaker pauses) to arrive at a grammatically correct sentence where she is addressing the \"dream girl.\"",

        "text": "Hi all.  Thanks in advance for help.  I just went through the entire comma section of a punctuation book and can’t figure out why the comma after “shoulder” is being recommended.  Here’s the sentence:\n\n“The father is gazing at his son’s eminently punchable face with a sense of pride, and his hand rests on the boy’s shoulder, implying a symbolic bequeathment of a love for hunting and a respect for it's quarries.”\n\nI'm not sure how to classify everything past “implying.” I would think it's a dependent clause which is why I thought there should be no comma.  Am I wrong about that?",

        "text": "So generally, when you have dialogue, you start a new paragraph.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"That's right,\" the reader confirmed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut occasionally you'll see a situation where there's a bit of description about the speaker before the dialogue starts, for instance:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe smiled a bit. \"Yes, I've seen that, too.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy question is, what are the rules regarding what can go before the dialogue starts without having to start a new paragraph? I have a feeling the text has to be about the speaker - the 'she' above couldn't be someone other than the speaker - but is there a rule about length, as well? I couldn't go on for sentences about her expression or what she's doing before starting her dialogue, right? Or could it go on for forever as long as the subject and the speaker remain the same person? Is there a rule or guideline for that? And is *not* having a new paragraph required if it's so short, or could I do something like:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe frowned at her question.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure,\" he said.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nor do those have to be/should they be together since the 'he' is the same person? Or am I entirely wrong and one should *always* start a new paragraph, even if the preceding sentence is just a short description of their physical aspect when speaking? What are the rules?",

Can it work like conjunction?\n\nNext, inserting the \"what success looks like\" bit just make it all confusing. I should mention that I also start the sentence with \"And,\" but I do think that's allowed if not recommended. Capitalization is also weird here.",
