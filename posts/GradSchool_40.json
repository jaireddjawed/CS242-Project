I sat in the car and cried for a good 20 minutes before I could even pull out of the parking lot and then it was a struggle to get home after I saw the grade was posted. \n\nI knew I was struggling in this class. Somehow I had managed to keep it at a borderline B. It had been an uphill battle all semester and the same work I had always gotten As for other professors was suddenly dropping into the C range. (I have As in my other classes) I feel absolutely worthless and have never doubted myself more until this semester. Every day made me feel like an idiot and like I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be there. \n\nThankfully we have 2 before our funding goes into jeopardy mode and I only have one semester of courses so I should be able to hold on to it. I‚Äôm just in panic mode now. I‚Äôm already burnt out and this has just made things worse. It feels like the final sign of maybe I really am out of my element and have waisted several years of my life for nothing. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar boat? How did you all cope? I know I need to hit the reset button and finish my other classes strong and focus on this next semester and then my exams. I can‚Äôt let this be what materializes my worth, but mentally it‚Äôs hard not to get caught up in it.",

I have had multiple internships in different autonomy groups at two well known aerospace companies  (one defense and one commercial), and did some work in the automotive industry as well. I now work full time in an aerospace company doing real time software for Space applications.   \n\n\nTo be honest, I don't feel as challenged as I was working in autonomy and R&amp;D, and with working in space applications, I'm learning a lot of new things about old things which is challenging in it's own way. I would really like to get back into the autonomous systems  of vehicles, but I'm unsure on what to graduate degree I should do. I like to work with vehicles primarily, enjoyed controls, and would love to get into path planning and perception. I have been recommended to get a masters in computer science, but I feel I may lose my edge with my mechanical background with controls. Plus, with programs I have seen there are prerequisite course requirements which I do not meet if I were to pursue computer science.   \n\n\nAlso slightly related, but I'm looking to relocate to the bay area as my fianc√©e is there where as I'm in Texas (not sure if that limits my options).",

As final papers are due and grades are trickling in, I'm kinda bummed out and just wanted to vent/hear your stories as well.\n\nClass 1: great professor, not super interested in the topic but it's a required class for my program. It's heavily discussion based and I strongly prefer to listen than to speak, so while I attended every class I was pretty quiet and didn't expect full attendance/participation points. The professor just send out our combined attendance/participation and weekly reading response grades and I got a B. He's a generous grader so a B is not great from him. Like I said, I expected that for participation but I'm frustrated on the reading response side of things. We got no feedback on those at any point in the semester and I would've worked harder on them if I knew he didn't consider it A-tier work. I did the math and an A in the class overall is still likely, but it's a bummer nonetheless.\n\nClass 2: This one frustrates me. I do not like the professor and think he chooses favorites and discriminates against some of us based on race, gender, etc. I don't have enough evidence to formally accuse him of that, nor do I desire to go that route in all honesty, but there are almost too many \"coincidences\" to brush off. We think he grades exams and papers solely based on how much he likes you, and I am definitely his least favorite. I am genuinely worried about getting a C in this class (almost unheard of in my program) because of how arbitrary and favoritism-based his grading seems. I walk out of this class furious almost every time based on some snide comment he makes about me.\n\nIf anyone else has any stories or would like to vent about their semester, drop 'em here",

Around the time I accepted I accepted a new job where I see myself growing currently in my first semester with great grades so far and doing well, but have hit this wall during finals for no motivation. 3 papers, topics are interesting but it just hit me\nContemplated dropping out because of this and just failing the courses before next semester.

Abusive faculty, lack of academic support, ridicule, funding cuts, and questionable ethics surrounding research at the institution have all solidified to my decision to leave a PhD (Education Studies) program with  absolutely no qualms. Life is far too short to remain voluntarily miserable and it's certainly to my benefit to depart now rather than three years in.\n\nI've applied and was admitted to several master's programs in the US for Spring '23 commencement, an MA in Community-Based Education and Social Change, as well as several MPA programs. I hold an MSEd in Childhood Education and the eventuality now is to work within the public or NGO/nonprofit sector --  leadership of organizations/departments committed to educational equity and DEI desired. That said, while my past professional experience lies exclusively within lower academia, there are certainly other areas of interest, e.g., urban and public affairs. I have no desire at all to enter the world of politics. A career super quant heavy, analyzing spreadsheets all day, is also not of interest.\n\nIt seems, thus, that the best route is the MA in Community-Based Education and Social Change, although there is difficulty in figuring out which degree will yield a better RoI (the degrees are quite expensive) while also providing for fulfilling career opportunities; both routes will seemingly prepare me for roles desired, although the MPA might be broader in scope?

        "text": "Tl;dr I'm a UG aspiring to go get a PhD but I'm super socially awkward when nervous, especially when at events with mostly profs. Given social networking is super important in academia, how do I overcome this? Or better, do any of you have a personal story of overcoming social anxiety in these situations?\n\nContext: I went to a day-long event with mostly profs (around 15-20 ppl) the other day, and I was super awkward the whole time. I wasn't sure if I could sit with the profs at lunch, and I ended up awkwardly sitting alone across the (long) table after the few grad students left to find their own place without inviting me (I'm a UG -- the only one there).\n\nI was disappointed because 4 of the profs know me very well but none of them rly made an effort to help make it less awkward for me (e.g., by saying I should come over and join them during lunch). In hindsight, I should have just went over there, but I was super nervous and not thinking straight.\n\nMy 3 grad school recommenders were there, and I thought this would be a nice chance to be able to talk to all of them at once (I was kinda hoping they'd talk me up to everyone else in the room -- especially to a prof whose school I just applied to). In particular, I thought my thesis advisor would help since I had even expressed to them I was nervous in a one-on-one convo beforehand. Granted, I ended up super awkward and barely could look them in the eye despite us talking on a weekly basis, but I was disappointed they didn't try to help me in some way by introducing me to the profs or trying to include me in convos. Ik I'm being sensitive, but it kinda stung.\n\nOn the other hand, of my two other recommenders in the room, one was super stressed hosting this event, and the other knows me the least. They both were super nice to me when I talked to them there even if they weren't actively trying to make it less awkward for me overall.\n\nIg it's just my thesis advisor that surprised me since they know me best (have had 20+ hours of one-on-one convos together), but they didn't really speak to me at the event. Again, partially my fault because I had trouble even looking at them (I look up to them sm that I get extra nervous around them) but still I thought this would go differently :/",

Everyone around me is super nice and super super accommodating. But I just...struggle sometime. Partly due to being the only foreigner and partly due to being the youngest one. Plus, this university is very well-reputed and everyone here is basically a genius.\n\nThis, in particular, has been a very difficult change to adapt to as my undergrad university back home was...well, not that great, to put it mildly. And the students there just cared about doing the bare minimum to get their diplomas. So I guess I have gotten used to being the smartest without really putting in a lot of effort.\n\nGrad school and my current uni is a completely different picture. I find myself studying all the damn time, particularly for one of my courses. And as the semester draws to an end and exams are just around the corner, my imposter syndrome is at an all time high. I do not feel like I belong in this group of geniuses. I am also worried that this is going to get worse once my research starts. (Currently I'm only doing courses and expected to start working on my research from next semester). \n\nIt has gotten so bad that I have not even had time to go exploring this wonderful new city that I am in. It is my first time being away from in a new country and I really wanted to enjoy and explore. But instead I am studying all the time and still struggling.\n\nI apologise if this rant did not make a lot of sense. I just have a lot going on in my mind and needed to get it out. Please give me advice on how to deal with this.",

This shocked me pretty bad and it is not that my performance is bad I produced a paper, 5 abstracts of projects that are completely not related to my thesis but PI asked for that work, and almost finished thesis project just waiting to publish more results, and PI will just start comparing me (and other lab students) with each other like: \"Why you cannot do this if -insert name of student- did it in one week\" or \"why you did not get a A in the quiz if -insert name of student- did it, you're won't have an outstanding record in your transcripts never\". So far such constant comments and behaviour just sent me straight to the therapist and I do not want to continue working under such environment so I've been looking for another opportunities out there, hence, I do not how to tell my PI that I want to explore with other laboratories without burning the bridge with PI since I will need a reference letter... **How would you address this ?** I am already depressed thinking that if I don't do it I will be stuck with the same environment for another 4 years.",

I have completed all of my required classes, and I was about to start preparing for my comprehensive exams.\n\nI started grad school in the middle of life, after about 15 years of working. I have done a bit of teaching both at a local college and as a contract lecturer at the school that I am enrolled in. My research and teaching interests, generally fall within the area of digital communications.\n\nBecause I have a bit of teaching experience and significant professional experience, I have been applying to the occasional teaching positions at colleges in my area.\n\nThis week I was a bit surprised that I got a call back for an interview for a full time teaching position.\n\nIf I happen to get offered this position, should I take it, even though it might significantly slow down my progress in my PhD?\n\nI had hoped after my PhD, I would be teaching in a university environment, but I know that it can be really hard to get positions, so it seems like it would be stupid to pass on a college-based teaching position.\n\nI am lucky that with my current combination of teaching work, stipends, scholarships and other research contracts I make pretty ok money as a PhD student, but as an older graduate student (with a family, mortgage, kid etc.) the stability of full time teaching position (and its salary and benefits) is appealing. My PhD program allows part-time study, so it shouldn't impact my ability to stay in the program.\n\nWhat are folks thoughts on whether I should stay focused solely on completing my PhD, or whether I should take a college teaching position, while trying to finish it?\n\nOf course none of this will matter if I don't get the position, which is the far more likely scenario :)",

This class has been entirely online since COVID19, and there is a good mix of grad students and undergrad. There are about 100 undergrad and 40 grad, and I grade their papers almost entirely by myself.\n\nI have been taught how to write by pretty tough teachers in high school, professors in undergrad and graduate school professors, so naturally, I also tend to grade pretty meticulously. The class has extra assignments for graduate students, and they comprise short essays and one final report (3800 words). \n\nAnd...gosh, I am astounded by the sheer lack of general penmanship. \n\nI mean, I am not a Shakespeare or Emily Bronte, but how am I supposed to react to students whose submissions look like a 5th grade \"research\" paper? It's not just some typo or misspelling. You see quotes being standalone sentences, double spacs in random places, font changes in the middle of the essay, making weird social commentaries, multiple citation formats (this one takes the cake), a page-long paragraph with zero citations, etc....it's like the basic writing rules be damned. \n\nI ended up giving 50-60 to probably 1/3 of the students, and lo and behold, they are already complaining to me or my professor. This had happened before with another assignment, and my professor stood by my grade for the most part, but at the same time, he tends to be pretty lenient. I m hoping that he doesn't bump up the grade by 20-30 points because that would make me look stupid and assholes, even though this is exactly the way I was graded for my own essays in many different classes.",

        "text": "I am a second year biomedical PhD student, and I am really struggling with my labs model system. I have a lot of background in using flies and really liked that system. When I was rotating, I thought it might be interesting to try a different system and ended up really liking the lab culture in a worm lab. I got along with everyone really well, and the PI seemed like a good fit for me personality wise. I wasn‚Äôt super interested in the science, but many older students told me that it is better to find a lab with a good environment, and that my passion for the project would once I started developing a project. My feelings about how I fit in the lab socially have not changed, I still feel supported and like everyone in the lab including the PI, however scientifically it feels like a really bad fit.\n \nI know this sound silly, but I cannot get the hang of these fucking worms. I am not able to get any crosses to work. I am failing at trying to backcross, which is supposed to be worm 101. The major assay our lab uses, I get different results every time and I cannot seem to replicate others work, including well established results in the field. I have been trying to get western blots working since July, and here I am In December still troubleshooting. I assumed they would be easier to use than flies sine they are more basic organisms and don‚Äôt live as long, but I honestly felt like the tools available in flies are so much better, and I feel extremely limited by what I can do in worms. Additionally, the main assay our lab uses feels like 10X more work than how you do it in other systems. It just feels like worms have to be the worst system to use to study this. I didn‚Äôt rotate long enough to really get to know the nuances of the model system, and my first impressions were way off. Every day I have to go in and try to get those squirmy little fucks to do anything I need them to do, I want to pull my hair out. I hate them. Additionally, the more I read about my topic in the literature, the more I realize that worms are not an appropriate system to study this and has very little translatable potential. The PI has also told me he is not interested in using other model systems.\n \nPeople in the lab try to be supportive and help me troubleshoot, but they cannot figure out what I am doing wrong, or how to help me. Honestly, I am really starting to hate this model system, and my project. It really did feel interesting at first, but the more data I see on this topic and the more I read about it, I just find it less and less interesting, and I have really lost faith in the approach our lab takes to solve this problem.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt even feel the problem we are solving is a worthwhile one anymore. I know that is harsh, but that is just how I feel as I‚Äôve gotten to learn more and more about this topic.\n \nI am unsure where to go from here, I am only a second year, and it seems like such an uphill battle to study something I don‚Äôt really believe in, in an organism that I am God awful at using.  I have never heard of someone switching labs because they couldn‚Äôt get a hang of the model system before. I also have my prelims coming up on this project, so changing projects or labs would put me very behind in my degree. I am considering asking about changing labs after my prelims. I also don‚Äôt want to burn a bridge with my PI because I really like my relationships with the people in the lab, it‚Äôs just a bad fit scientifically. I also don‚Äôt know that this is a legitimate reason to change labs, and I feel very incapable, I mean who can‚Äôt even figure out worms.. Should I just tough it out and cross my fingers and hope things will just click with worms eventually and I will learn to like my project?",

Now there are 3 levels to CA, I'm currently in the first level and the college course which is Bcom hons my bachelor's degree corresponds with the second level(which is the most difficult out of all three as only 1.29% of people pass). Not the whole of it but 25% of it.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that I might fail a sem and would have to restart college by going to a different one, or if i pass somehow i will transfer to a different college as managing ca with the college I'm currently enrolled at is very difficult.\n\nNow i want to ask that here we have two scenarios,\n1. I fail college, and with a new year start a new degree at a different college and pursue CA side by Side\n\n2. I somehow pass, and because i want to complete the professional course i transfer to an easier college.\n \n\n\nNow i really want to go to the us to do a MSc finance/mba program or maybe a MsBa.
