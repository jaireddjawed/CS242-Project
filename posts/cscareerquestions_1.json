Despite that, I haven't gotten comfortable where I am, I'm constantly reminding myself I want to start aiming closer to my goal.\n\n At this point, I'm wondering if anyone has advice on entry level jobs that could lead to future positions in software development with the right moves. And when I say entry level, I mean I have my GCSEs, I went to college during COVID and while I was getting kicked out of my parents and I completely flunked it with D's and E's.\n\nI'm aware that what I'm asking is probably quite an edge case and not easily accomplished, but I'm tired of playing \"victim of my own circumstances\" and just go and try to do what I want to do.\n\nShould I be working on small projects on the side of my shitty restaurant job for a better chance in the future? What type of job titles should I be looking for? Any help is appreciated.",

        "text": "I recently participated in a discussion about whether programmers will be replaced by AI in the (far) future. We discussed that we have difficulty imagining that old, robust applications (such as those used by banks and insurance companies) will no longer need programmers, but that front-end development (building new apps) may be at risk. Now frontend is something that I have always enjoyed and I have hoped to become a frontend (or full-stack) developer. But then we brought up that even with the availability of Wordpress and other free tools for webpage creating, there's still a huge demand for frontend developers right now. So it's not like they would lose their jobs just because people can generate a nice webpage themselves using some online tools. So I guess the question really is, **what do you think the developers will have to learn to be able to pursue their careers in CS**? I'm majoring in software engineering, but there are also data science and business informatics modules at my university. I find data science interesting but so far, I always imagined myself as a frontend developer (I do like React and Vue.js).",

The company has recently realized this is a systemic issue across the engineering org and are working with everyone to get them the correct titles, compensation and job descriptions that match their actual duties. This process has been ongoing for months. \n\nI've been getting pressured by my manager to change my title in email/slack/teams to reflect the work that I actually do, as it can be strange to get emails from a tech lead with their email signature saying they're a SWE1. In my mind I don't have the new official title yet so this makes no sense to me. The new title would also come along with around a $60k pay bump ($80k/yr-&gt;$140k/yr). If they're so concerned with my title maybe they should focus harder on getting it changed?",

I just want some advice on what should I focus my time on. \n\nI've been developing native android apps for 2 years now, shifted to Flutter for a project i had to do for the stem society of my college( app was used by 4k+ people). Now I am interested in backend. Learned basic spring, left it, started with node, got pretty advanced in it. Currently trying to make a backend clone of YouTube. Learned system design along with it. But it's getting boring.\n\nNow I still have time till September and I want to work on something which could actually help me land a job in a top tech company after 3 years. What should it be? Shall I focus on competitive programming? (Started leetcode a year back, did 50 something questions, got bored again :/) or should I contribute to open source or something? Learning newer tech is not a problem, I just need some guidance and avoid wasting time juggling too many technologies.",

I feel pressured because I hear that internships make studying cs at uni worth it. At the moment my only skills are python and java. So I have a long way to go in terms of learning. Is it best for me to try to have a basic understanding of numerous skills in order to stack up a bunch of internships before graduating? Or should I focus on perfecting a set of skills and only try for internships where I could see myself working at that company or field?  \n\n\nOne of my professors recommended I take the second route while a lot of students I see usually follow the first approach. I am conflicted because I am not 100% certain what career I would like to pursue but I would like to keep as many doors open as possible. My thought process was that stacking internships would let me get past the resume stage whenever I find companies I would like to work at in the future. But now I am unsure.  \n\n\nI am brand new to the scene so I apologize for any logical errors in my post. Any advice is appreciated!",

(Just a bit of background, I never planned to do programming outside of college but here I am)\n\nLong story short I graduated from college last year and landed a job as a Jr. Programmer Analyst. I took the job mostly because it was an opportunity even though the pay isn't the greatest. I live in a fairly high COL. (Salary at 45,000 in the States).\n\nA year is approaching and I would like to ask for a raise. I've been enjoying my time here since I mostly work remote and my senior is a great manager/mentor. The work isn't to difficult as well.\n\nMost of the things I've been doing is maintaining/creating webpages and integrating APIs. So a lot of Javascript, C#, HTML and SQL. Sometimes I fiddle with CSS but no to much.\n\nI've been trying to look more into a \"Programmer Analyst\" but it seems vague. Would it be fair to put on my resume I am a backend dev, frontend dev or web developer? I'm not sure where or if I land in any of those categories.\n\nI've been through two review performances and I've recieved excellent results. I don't live to far from a big city so I was hoping for a raise between $55,000 - $60,000. That seems to be the average but once again I'm not to sure.\n\nThanks.",

Or would i still have to start from the bottom since i’ve never coded much in my work experience? Though i have used powershell quite a bit and know python basics. \n\nI was thinking i could lean into a devops role or somthing that combines IT and coding. I’m also interested in cyber security so a “security engineer” would be a position i could see myself in. I’m not 100% sure if i want to be a full blown software engineer to be honest. I’ve just realized that most IT is very customer service esque which i don’t like. CS seems better for introverts like me.. less end user interaction.. perhaps that’s not accurate though. anyways, thoughts ?",

Throughout undergrad I slacked off and just didn't apply myself as much as I should have. I didn't really feel passionate about software engineering until around senior year which is right around when things started to go downhill, just my luck.\n\nAs it stands, I graduated fall 2022 with 0 internships and have been feeling completely lost. Even if I do somehow build a decent portfolio of projects, I then have to face a competitive, over-saturated junior dev job market.\n\nI have applied to startups, government jobs, looked into contracts, anything you can think of to get my foot in the door, but nothing. When I was applying to new grad roles last fall, I got a couple bites, but since those roles have been filled I have not heard back from anyone. I apply to around 10 roles a day on average. I have considered grad school but it's just too expensive for me and my family.\n\nI no longer qualify for new grad roles, which means I now have to go for roles that require 2+ YOE.\n\nI am grinding Leetcode everyday and just trying to pick up new tools (React/Express) in the meantime to build projects so I keep my mind sharp, but it's getting super discouraging.\n\nI know that my lack of internship and professional experience is my fault for not dedicating myself in undergrad, but it honestly feels like I will never land a software engineering role at all and I'm terrified that I'm gonna have to let my degree go to waste and find something else.\n\nI will try my best to keep trudging along and building projects/grinding Leetcode, but is there any hope for me? Do I just have to wait out this bad market?\n\nAny encouragement would be appreciated but if you have any honest and harsh words just lay it on me lol.",

In the last 2 years of my university education, I spent a lot of my free time to learn Data Science/Machine Learning. \n\nIn September 2020, I started a job a a contractor in Boston. My title was 'Associate Engineer' but I was dealing with Data Science/Machine Learning in my job. I was paid $36.5/hour and I didn't have any PTO and I was paying half of my health insurance. \n\nIn March 2022, I got promoted to Data Scientist position. This was still contractor position and my salary was increased to $50/hour. (This means that my total compensation is $104,000/year. And I am working in this company for 2.5 years on Data Science/Machine Learning)\n\nToday is March 2023 and I am still working as a Contractor - Data Scientist in the same company.  I still don't have any PTO, stock, bonus, and I am still paying half of my insurance. \n\nWhen I look at what the total compensations of Data Scientists who have similar amount of experience with me in Boston, I feel like I am treated as a cheap work source but I cannot be sure if this is true since I guess getting a raise in the same company takes relatively a long time. \n\nAt this point, do you think if I am getting paid very low considering the fact that I have been working on the same company for 2.5 years and I am not coming from CS background ?",

        "text": "I hate accounting and I think the future of it being a good career is bleak. I could try transition to IT but I’m curious if programming would be better. \n\nI’m somewhat smart and did AP/college classes in high school. I’m really good at different kinds of math and logic. \n\nI was a CS minor but the classes were elementary. Even then I felt like I was really good at Java and it came easily to me.\n\nI’m intimidated by having to self-learn to keep learning as a programmer but I know I can easily with discipline. It also seems like the learning never stops which is intimidating.  \n\nIs it a good career to work towards for good WLB remote jobs and good pay? Would it be more pressure than accounting?",
