I'm curious which shows, past or present, benefit more from a 20 plus episode format?  \n\nI'm re-watching both Fringe and Person of Interest for the first time.  I've noticed the longer format allows them to slowly world build, introduce multiple plots and villains, and really flesh the show out.  Getting little crumbs of information that all connect as the season progresses.  There might be a handful of episodes considered \"filler\" but overall most of the episodes have some relevance to the overall arc.\n\nCurious if anyone has any other shows they feel was worth having a longer format as opposed to shows that would've better off condensing the season into less episodes.",

        "text": "To start with, I'm writing this from the UK - that context being important.\n\nOut of morbid curiosity, I was reading some IMDB reviews for the new Lean Rimini hosted quiz show sponsored by *People* Magazine - *People Puzzler*.\n\nIt sounds just as awful as you might expect. What came as a surprise though, was several comments saying things along the lines of \"sure, it's not supposed to be *Jeopardy!*\" which gave the impression that *Jeopardy!* is seen as a fairly high-minded quiz show.\n\nI'm not dissing *Jeopardy!* for a second - the concept sounds great, clips I've seen are entertaining, and I've often wondered why we've not imported a version over here - but whilst it's clearly no game for mugs, it's never struck me as a massively 'intellectual' show exactly, from what I've seen.\n\nThe comparison that comes instantly to mind is the BBC's *University Challenge*, which is the kind of quiz that has most of us feeling very pleased with ourselves if we get more than a handful of the answers right. It covers all sorts of topics, but not much in the way of 'popular culture', and it's *hard*. I mean, honestly, sometimes it's enough of a challenge just to understand the *question*. It has a real cult following over here though, and tends to dominate the UK's twitter trending whilst it's airing live.\n\nSo, in this age of global media, I was wondering if people in the USA were aware of it, if many people watch it even - and if so, what you make of it?",

(That's when Lee Pace isn't firing on all cylinders, of course).\n\nI love how the character is continually evolving as well. In the first season, Gordon was in a very dark place, like he was numb to the world. Then he grew in confidence. Plus there's the ongoing health cares and crisis of confidence. \n\nMcNairy is also just so damn likeable and endearing in the role. His subtle delivery brings about so many laugh out loud moments. &gt;!(My favourite part is when he's reading a magazine about the virus he accidentally created and he's like 'jeez, this is my legacy, the even named it too' - had me rolling)!&lt;\n\nA fully realised character. It's crazy he never got any awards or accolades.\n\nThe funniest thing for me is, the only other role I've seen McNairy in was briefly at the end of Narcos: Mexico season 1 where he appears to be playing a completely different character, some hench macho gun crazy guy. Gotta get round to watching the rest of that some time.",

I get it - sitcoms are supposed to be silly and most characters are caricatures of real people in order to have some conflict each episode and generally, I enjoy that. I know they won’t always make rational decisions and we watch for the wonky situations they find themselves in.\n\nBut on the last two sitcoms I watched, I found myself genuinely not enjoying most scenes/storylines with the main characters:\n\nParks and Rec - I got through the whole show in a month, so clearly I enjoyed it. Ron and April in particular were really great and I felt proud of their growth by the end. Others like Tom and Chris were a bit exaggerated but even then, I got laughs out of them. Leslie, though - ugh! I get that she meant well and by the end of each episode there was a positive resolution. But I just felt she was a terrible friends - constantly ignoring people’s wants, steamrolling conversation, making others do things they don’t want to. I get that was her character but it just made me sour.\n\nNow I’m watching Abbott Elementary and having the same experience with Janine. She continually behaves just like Leslie in many ways to the point where I think no one in real life would put up with this. For some reason, I don’t feel like that with any other character. Side note - I should with the principal but the actor absolutely bodies that role and gets the biggest laughs from me.\n\nAnyway - is it just me or what?",

Favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Fringe, Lost, Dark, and maybe Supernatural. Especially want to mention Supernatural because I didn't really like the last few seasons but there were still some good episodes and plots that kept me going. Didn't care for the ending but didn't necessarily hate it either, and was ultimately still glad that I stuck it out.\n\n\nSo just how bad are we talking? Like the writing just flat out took a huge dive? Or are we talking like BAD bad, as in it turns into a cringe incoherent mess and is completely unwatchable?\n\n\nSpoiler free if possible just in case!",

        "text": "The original cast of SNL was called the \"Not Ready for Prime Time Players\" and that title stuck for generations of SNL performers.  So it got me thinking which of them have gone on to the greatest success in Prime Time after they left SNL. To be clear, this is about prime time TV on broadcast networks, cable, and even streaming, but not movies (with apologies to Dan Akroyd, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, and Will Farrel, among many others). This should be properly who went in to be series regulars in lead or supporting roles.\n\nHere's a few examples I thought of, please add you own:\n\nJane Curtain is the only one of the originals to make it big right after SNL with Kate and Allie and then later 3rd Rock From the Sun.\n\nJulia Louis Dreyfus success in Prime Time is counter to her relatively short time on SNL with mega star turns in Seinfeld, The New Adventures of Old Christine, and VEEP.\n\nTina Fey was creator and lead on 30 Rock, and now is a producer and regular on Only Murders in the Building (starring very frequent SNL guest star Steve Martin and one season cast member Martin Short - who made his name in movies).\n\nAmy Polher started and wrote (produced?) for Parks and Rec.\n\nAndy Samberg was the star and producer of Brooklyn 99\n\nChevy Chase mad his name in movies, but was a supporting actor in Community.\n\nJim Belushi had a starring turn in a sitcom: According to Jim\n\nPhil Hartman was a supporting character in NewsRadio but the show fell apart without him (what could have been).\n\nDavid Spade had a nice run in Just Shoot Me.\n\nWho else is out there making good Prime Time style TV.  Anyone who shifted to Dramas?",
