I made an alt so I could stop this, as it was illegal, and scratch team decided that, instead of ip banning the p*dophile, or better yet giving his ip to the federal bureau of intelligence, that they would ip ban ME and not ip ban him, and now I can not protect my friend from this se*ual harassment and rzpe threats, and it's all because of the scratch team. People claim the St doesn't make mistakes, and that they know what they are doing, but clearly not. He sent things like links to p*rn, saying he wanted to do that to her, and sent her messages saying \"oh, I loved last night, you have the perfect p****, and such nice b**bs for someone so young.\" And started impersonating me to say those things at some point using fake accounts pretending to be me.\n\n\nAnd yet, I get ip banned, not him, and people still claim that st always knows what they are doing.",
