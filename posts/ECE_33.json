Would the accuracy improve if I replace three resistors with a single one?",

If I adjust my drain resistor in the 2 symmetric CS stages after the differential, my gain keeps going down, no matter if I increase or decrease it, so I'm stuck there. I tried adding an identical CS stage (4th) after each current CS stage (3rd), but when I do that, it has no effect. The 3rd has no effect anymore, and the response is basically as if I'd never added the fourth one. \n\nAny ideas on how I can get around this and shoot my gain up?

For the non-initiated:\n\nSymbols are CL (load capacitance), Td (delay), Si (input slew), So (output slew), Vo (output voltage), Io (output current).\n\nNDLM: Td = f(CL, Si), So = g(CL, Si), modeled using a Thevenin equivalent.\n\nCCS: Io = f(CL, Si, t)\n\nECSM: Io = f(CL, Si, Vo)\n\nWhen the load can be treated as a lumped capacitor, the behavior of each of these is very clear. For NLDM, the delay and slew are determined using look-up table on {CL, Si}. For CCS, you integrate Io(t), which is determined using a look-up table on {CL, Si}. ECSM should be similar to CCS, but the calculation is a little more complicated, since performing the look-up on {CL, Si} generates an I-V curve.\n\nNow, what I do not understand is how this addressed for loads that must be modeled using an RC network. For NLDM, there is no problem, because you can perform the delay look-up calculates using the total downstream capacitance, and the delay look-up corresponds to the Elmore delay of the driver due to the driver resistance and downstream capacitance; incorporating the wire delay is straight-forward. However, to me, it's not clear how using a current source model (for ECSM or CCS) improves the accuracy. Unless a crude circuit simulation is built into the delay calculation, to me, it seems like NLDM / CCS / ECSM are all equivalent; there would be no benefit to the more accurate models (ECSM, CCS) compared to NLDM.\n\nAny idea what I'm missing?",

The main reason I chose EE was because I was fascinated with the theory of electricity, but I don't know if that's enough to get me through.

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI've got an industrial control panel project at work that got me thinking about the pricing of circuit breakers, especially with regard to their cost of production. It appears these devices generally consist of an injection-molded plastic case and some metallic internals components (springs, mechanical levers / arms / etc, and some type of arc-diffusing device) . \n\nEven with cost of components, assembly, engineering, performance characterization, technology licensing, certification, marketing -- it seems there would still be significant margin in this product. For example, I'm using this [Eaton breaker](http://www.galco.com/buy/Cutler-Hammer-Div-of-Eaton-Corp/EGC3100FFG?source=googleshopping&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6enQBRDUARIsAGs1YQhJbI8zb7tazQn0C_ptgHLp72JcwtoVEGDyKlxZ3FTvzF5goLIbrZgaAn9gEALw_wcB) as the main breaker in one of my cabinets. 3 pole, 100A, 100kAIC, 480VAC i.e. nothing crazy, but priced at nearly $750. As the engineering, characterization, and licensing are fixed/sunk costs, is the long-run unit profit on these spectacular?\n\nTLDR; I want to know why it's not a good idea to get into the circuit breaker business.\n\nThanks!\n\nPukkaLap\n\n",

The applicants seems to have been filtered down (by HR) to only people with a bachelors in EE or CE and currently pursuing a masters degree.\n\nI've had already given three interviews so far and not happy with any of them. I am here to check if these questions are too hard.\n\nQuestion: If I asked you to design a circuit that can only have one AA battery, and it needs to use a sensor that requires 3.3V, how would you power the sensor? \n\nNext question: if you could use both a step down regulator and a linear LDO, how would you power a sensor that is sensitive to power supply noise while being power efficient? Yes I know I'm loading the question. Nobody got this either, one of them told me to put both of them in parallel.\n\nI ask if either SPI or I2C is faster. One out of three told me I2C is faster with enthusiasm. I ask them to explain why one is typically capable of being faster than the other, seeding their thoughts by first asking what is the biggest difference between I2C and SPI. One of them reach the point where he can blurt out \"is it because of the pull up resistors?\". I counted that answer as close enough.\n\nI asked \"what is a makefile, in your own words\", one out of three described a compiler instead. A good answer would involve keywords like \"rules\" and \"dependencies\" but nobody did that outright, talked more in terms of scripts.\n\nTwo out of three didn't know what a memory leak was. Question was asked by my teammate because all of them had some RTOS experience.\n\nTwo out of three had listed PCB design experience, but nobody could answer how to arrange components evenly spaced in a perfect circle. The guy who listed EAGLE told me he would draw a circle and constrain the components to the circle, I explained that EAGLE doesn't have constraints like a mechanical CAD tool, good try though. I'm not going to pretend I know every corner of every piece of software but that one was bullshit.\n\nAll of them could reverse a string no problem\n\nAre these questions too hard?\n\nAlso this is literally the first time I'm interviewing anybody in my life, am I supposed to give the correct answer back?

However, looking at the publications of many professors in the field, it seems like the only math, if any, is just a bunch of really ugly vector calculus with a little bit of statistics and PDE theory mixed in.\n\nI took a proof based course in real analysis as an elective this year, and was surprised by how much I loved it, far more so than any class I had ever taken before. Topics like topology look like a lot of fun to get more into, but I worry that studying EM would lock me out of this because I can't find many professors who really get into higher level theory in math.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on where I could go from here? It seems like signal processing, controls and such get more into things like abstract algebra and topology, but I feel like it's a bit late to change my specialization during the application process. I worry that if I try to shoehorn DSP into my statement, I'll just end up looking really indecisive (which, well, I am) and be a weaker candidate.",
