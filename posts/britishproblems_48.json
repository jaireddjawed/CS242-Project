        "text": "Hi all,\n\nJust venting a British thought here. I have woken up this morning with tiny drums in my head after one to many gins last night (as one does) and have been in need of assisstance. Being British, we all know that there is only one thing in the morning that can save you from certain death by hangover; the bacon sandwich.\n\nPraise be unto the bacon sandwich for all of its marvellous curing (and cured) properties. Hangover? Hunger? Polio? You name it, the bacon sandwich has it covered. Now, if you need one, as British people we all know where to get a decent bacon sandwich and drink like clockwork. Good ol' reliable Greggs.\n\nSetting aside the outrageously cheap £2.50 for their breakfast deal that you could busk in a half hour, it is always consistent. And as bacon is one of the 5 main food groups for the common Brit, it is all the more important.\n\nSo here is my gripe: why stop serving bacon sandwiches at 11am?\n\nIs it a cruel joke? Are they blindly subscribing to the arbitrary notion that breakfast foods must stop being served at 11am or the fabric of the universe will unfurl? With this, Greggs wantonly spits at us in the eye and laughs heartily at our shared misery. Just thinking about it, there has been many a time where my friends and I have desperately wanted a bacon sandwich, but Greggs is closed and we dont want to pay £5+ at a cafe for something a blind chimp could make at home for pittance. \n\nI am completely convinced that Greggs would become a fortune 500 company overnight if they just served bacon sandwiches all day. Or maybe Im just hungover and pissed that they stop serving at 11am, but I feel its more the first former.\n\nWhat do all the Greggs and bacon lovers think about this?",
