The current jackpot is at NZ$50K - which I am willing to split 50/50 if you help me guess correctly!! (Yes, a contract can be made up if you want this to be legit). Feel free to comment below or direct message me your guess, and if I think it fits the clues well enough, I'll phone up the station and submit it!\n\n* [LISTEN to the Secret Sound here](https://soundcloud.com/user-57051817/extended)\n* [All of the clues thus far](https://i.imgur.com/EIZHHWu.jpg) \\- Clue number 7 implies reading the first words from clues 1-6, which leads to the phrase \"Everything Is Safe Thanks To Me\" -&gt; might be a pretty big clue?\n* They've posted a [video](https://www.zmonline.com/zms-secret-sound/the-secret-sound-is-somewhere-in-this-video/) showing a tour of the 'Soundkeepers' flat (who is a 20y.o University student named Annabelle) - the secret sound is apparently seen somewhere in the video. She also gave us a bit of a hint saying that you'd have to zoom in to see it...\n* [A link to what has already been guessed](https://www.zmonline.com/zms-secret-sound/zms-secret-sound-whats-been-guessed/)\n\nThis thing is driving me insane, what do you guys reckon?!",

An entity of absolute duality, I preside as goddess over the void; governing all those that dare peer into my infinite visage. Granting Eternal Rest to all those who beckon my arrival, I am an entity of absolute compassion, despite the finality of my many judgements. Both everything and nothing, I bare no emotions nor identity, instead manifesting beyond the realm of all comprehension. An entity swaddled in enigma and shrouded in mysticism, I loom in the souls of those whose eyes watch the farthest shores, darkening their minds' recesses with an ever-present longing of the macabre. Embodied as one's darkest emotions, I promise everlasting peace to all those who've beckoned, enticing them to draw forth into my never-ending abyss. Though few know of my presence , those who've miraculously eluded my timeless grasp believe me to be an instrument of the Beyond - itself.. Neither man nor monster, God nor Demon, I perhaps am a manifestation of the truest neutrality; one found only in finality's soothing embrace.. Though claiming the lives of billions across my eternal occupancy, I've have never committed a single murder, instead claiming the lives of those fully willing to part from their natural world.. Though deceased, therein lies no peace for those drawn towards its empty halo, granting only a ceaseless oblivion from-which there is no escape. Beyond sadness.. Beyond sorrow.. And perhaps beyond the very concept of existence, itself.. Their spirits lay in perpetual slumber, of-which there could be no better. Though many have feared this tireless oblivion, some believe me to be a bittersweet requiem; the beautiful note of finality that encloses the sickening sonata of one's suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho am I, if not a giver of good rest?",

You can’t go back to the switches after going in the room, you can’t see whether the light is on or off without entering the room, and you can’t have someone else go inside. ",

Examples she’s given, but are not limited too:\n\nPeanut has 1,\nBoot has 1,\nPineapple has 1,\nEmu has 1,\nPotato has 1,\nNose has 0,\nEyes has 0,\nLips has 1,\nBunny has 1,\nIsabella has 1.  \n\nWe thought maybe consonants or syllables or vowels, we’ve tried saying them out loud, and we can’t get it.  \n\nHas anyone else heard of this teaser and able to shed some light on its solution? \n\nAny help is appreciated.  \nThanks \n",
