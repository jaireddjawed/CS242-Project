        "text": "Basically the title. I'm a 19m HS senior who has never really had any marketable \"passion\" in life. I really like music, I played in band all throughout HS and loved it. The thing is, I know that pursuing music would lead to a very poor financial position in life (I could be a band instructor but that might take the fun out of music honestly). So music is basically a no, because of the financial implications and the fact that commodifying your hobbies is a good way to end up disliking them.\n\nSo, this leaves me with a very limited list of careers to choose from. Recently, however, I have been considering some new career paths. One of those is being a teacher. I would probably only want to teach high school or even college b/c Elementary and Middle schoolers are generally more insufferable. With high schoolers, however, while there would be kids that would annoy me, I think the good would even out the bad. I now realize that I really enjoy explaining things to people. Whenever a classmate is confused I love helping them understand what they are confused on. lol call it mansplaining or something but I love it and I don't think it comes from a negative place. I get an excitement from teaching someone something that I never get from anything else other than music. And when they understand the thing they were previously confused about, their reaction is genuinely very rewarding. To be fair, I am pretty terrible at explaining things, but I am willing to work on that. So clearly, I enjoy teaching at least to some degree.\n\nI'm definitely thinking about teaching in a very idyllic sense right now. I need someone to give me the reality of being a teacher, not the romanticized version of it that I have in my head. I know about the obvious drawback of being a teacher which is money. Teachers notoriously do not make a lot of money but honestly I think I wouldn't mind.\n\nAllow me to explain. I don't come from the greatest of upbringings, my parents are divorced and neither every had very much money. It was clear to me, even as a young kid, that my parents were both living paycheck to paycheck. The average salary of a teacher is higher than what my parents make. I'm the first person in my family to have the opportunity to go to college. My point is, I'm pretty well acquainted with a lack of money and I think being a teacher wouldn't be that bad. I am pretty confident that I could live happily on a teacher's salary, assuming I live alone/split rent with roommates ofc.\n\nAll of this combined has left me ruminating over the idea of becoming a teacher for the past few days. It is mostly just me daydreaming, though I'm wondering if there is actually some substance to the idea. Given that I seem to have a passion for it, that it would provide very steady employment and would likely provide good benefits, (with a poor salary unfortunately) I think it would be a great fit for me. College would also be very cheap, given that I have received a lot of money from financial aid and scholarships. I could also get even more scholarships for just being and Education major because there are a lot of those in my area. I would basically be able to graduate debt free if I play my cards correctly.\n\nThat being said, it certainly would not be the most financially intelligent career to chase. For example, I could major in accounting/finance/CS/engineering and make more money than a teacher could ever dream of. Being a first gen college student, there is also this pressure to \"make it\" and achieve a high level of financial success. I don't know though, at the end of the day, its my life and I should live how I want to.\n\ntldr; I want to be a teacher and I want to know if that is something I should reconsider. I think that the low salary wouldn't be that bad because I have been very close to people with really bad money troubles for much of my life. I think that all things considered, it would be a very good fit for me.",

When you’re 8 years old you aren’t worried about food, money, or the future. You live in the moment all the time. At least for me, seems like the only time I had real/genuine friends was in elementary when nobody cared about being fake for social media or to impress others. You dressed however the heck you wanted. Come home do some basic math homework and watch the new Pokémon episode.\n\nIdk if it’s just me but I miss that. Just the simple life I had as a kid. I wasn’t ever worried or sad I was always just trying to play outside or play on my 3DS. I feel kids today don’t have that at least from what I can tell from my cousins, they only ever go on YouTube or TikTok and want instagram/Snapchat at 6 years old. I don’t even know what this was it seems like a rant but I wanna hear from you guys what’s something you miss from back then?",

And that the airline told him he still owes another $500 regardless.\n\nThen he says how he doesn't wanna ask any customers or anything and he's just asking businesses if they can help him out. He said he raised about $460 and only needed $40 so I asked my co worker if he could spare anything and we gave it to him out of our pockets.  \n\nSome other customers over heard this and after he left asked us if we thought he was being truthful or not. My co worker doesn't entirely believe him either and he's been ribbing me about it. \n\nObviously it's impossible to tell if he was actually being truthful but 🤷‍♂️ his story was weirdly specific and tbh I guess I don't care cause I did my good deed.

        "text": "Some background info: I live in India. I live on the outskirts of my city. I only have to go to college once a week. The work, basically chores, were replacing certain parts and printing certain things. Generally the stores ask you to come back the next day to pick them up. The stores are near my college which is about a 2 hour journey (thanks to traffic and not the distance).   \n\n\nThe incidents which made this my luckiest unlucky day:  \n1. Morning, on my way to college, my two-wheeler abruptly stops and cannot be started again. (unlucky). I had to park my two-wheeler at a commercial complex. I had to take a taxi and reached late for my lecture. The professor did not take attendance today (lucky).   \n\n\n2. After lectures, I took the bike share for my work. It took me three hours because I reached during lunch time (unlucky). I was able to get it all done in one go (lucky) which I did not need to waste another day for them.   \n\n\n3. At Bus Stop while parking my cycle, I found out that the bike share costs had gone up by 4x since the last time I used it (unlucky). I had free credits in the app (lucky).   \n\n\n4. I didn't have to wait long for the bus (lucky) but after getting on, right before my stop, I found that the route had changed. It took me a km away. (unlucky).  \n\n\n5. At the destination stop, I was told that the ticket counter was not working. (unlucky). The ticket counter was not giving out the tickets. I had to wait for some time and was told that I'd have to go back on the bus to next stop and then end-ride because I had used a bus card. Turned out after waiting for 10 mins that the counter was only able to end-ride from the card but not the other functions. (lucky)   \n\n\n6. I had to walk back to my parked vehicle and wait for the mechanic to come (about 3 kms) due to the bus route change thing. The mechanic was late because he had gone to get spare parts in a different part of the city but could not find them. I had coordinated the time with him. I had to wait for 2 hours. (unlucky). I was able to find a restaurant with good food and willing to let me just stay out of the sun (lucky).   \n\n\n7. I had failed to submit some other work on time and decided to call my employer/friend to ask for an extension. Turned out that he had an accident (lucky) and it didn't affect the time of submission. But he was hurt really bad (unlucky) and he is my friend.   \n\n\n8. After the mechanic came and checked. He told me that I was really lucky today because some bearings had come loose above the engine. Generally when this sort of thing happens, the bearings would fall inside the engine and it would mess it all up leading to huge costs. Now, it could be solved cheaply.   \n\n\nSo, do you think the name is apt, the luckiest unlucky day?",

It felt really like I was missing out on something, because we don’t do these sleepover trips that often (they live in another city). \n\nNevertheless, I went to a lecture today and my friend couldn’t wait to tell me how once she heard I wasn’t coming she and another friend were less excited to go. She also said the evening turned out to be boring and that they would have wanted to go home early. I wasn’t really happy to hear that, but I did appreciate her telling me this to try to make me feel better. \n\nBut then, she said that she discussed with my other friend how they realised ‘the friend group dynamic does not click without me’ and that they need me for it to be fun. \n\nI am usually quite introverted and never really try to be the life of the party. Therefore, I was really surprised to hear this from my friend. It really made me emotional as I never really thought I was that important in the friend group.",

I help him out all the time but he comes across extremely ungrateful. Recently, I helped him out with rescheduling flight tickets which he was unable to do on his own ( Simple task) . But not a word of thanks. Also I am nearing 40 and still unmarried. May be that hurts him. Most of his friends have married children. He is very loving towards my sister. They have a jovial relation. Just poured my heart out and any advice would be welcomed!!",

Though as soon as the year began, I remembered New Year's resolutions are things you strive to do, not things you hope for. So I kind of cornered myself with one of the things I'm the least qualified to do, even though I would like to do it. And with the Julian calendar having just finished New year's celebrations, I no longer have an excuse to hold this off.\n\nHow has your year been so far? Does it look like things are turning up?",

        "text": "I, F22, work at a local retail place. I was covering a coworkers lunch break when I had a customer ask for me assistance in finding an item. Well, we didn’t have it. At the end of the conversation, he told me I was very pretty, and I thanked him for it. I was blushing a little as I’m still not used to compliments. \n\nI’ve been insecure my entire life, but recently have started receiving more and more compliments lately. The day before, a little girl told me I had mermaid hair. My hair is bright red and very curly. It was super sweet, lol. \n\nAfterwards, the guys buddy came over and they left my section. I was reflecting a bit on the conversation I had with the guy, and I was really happy he went out of his way to give me a compliment. I love when strangers are super kind. Even I’ve complimented a guy stranger before. Compliments are free and awesome. \n\nI was half joking with myself that maybe that guy also could’ve been gay? He was with a buddy, so maybe I shouldn’t be so presumptuous and think that just because he complimented me, that doesn’t mean he was going to go tell his friend how hot I am and how into me he was. \n\nWell, I think that’s exactly what he did. Because a few minutes later, he actually came back. He mumbled something, and I went, “Sorry?” With a smile on my face. He mumbled it again, and I went, “One more time?” I consider myself to be slightly hearing impaired, but have no aids for it or anything. Finally, he cleared his throat, and said, “Can I have your number?” \n\nMy coworker was back from his lunch at that point, and between being hit on and the embarrassment I turned bright red. You could’ve cooked an egg on my face with how quick I burned up. I explained that I actually have a boyfriend. The guy said no problem, have a good day, and left. He glanced over at me when he left and winked at me. I wanted to just drop into a pile of goo. He was pretty cute, and was really charming too. I went on my break after explaining what happened to my coworker, and I saw the guy and his buddy walking over to the bar near the store. I think his buddy was probably buying him a beer, lol. \n\nI wish I was brave enough to tell the guy to keep his head up. It takes massive balls to tell a girl she’s pretty, let alone ask for her number like that!! I wasn’t creeped out at all. I also don’t ever get mad about “well I’m at work don’t hit on me” because I’m just naturally very friendly, and if a guy and I have a nice conversation, I think, of course he’s going to interpret that as me being attracted to him. I’m sure I’ve thought, “Wow, that guy was super into me,” when someone was just being nice to me to.",

I remember getting my license for the first time and first job at 16, going to the gym for the first time, the excitement of picking a university and dreaming about the stereotypical college life. Skipping class because we got into university and driving around the countryside with my friends. I remember going to a party for the first time when I was 18 and how cool it felt. Now I day drink and hate it. I could also eat whatever I wanted without feeling like shit. Now I get bloated from having a small muffin for breakfast and have to work out much harder to stop myself from becoming fat again. I had rose-tinted glasses on in terms how I viewed the world. I didn't realize how tough and cold it really is like I do now. I didn't have any real responsibility other than driving to my part time job. Now I have real shit to worry about such as paying the bills, waking up early and commuting to work (don't have it tomorrow), My close friends and I don't see each other as much as we used to and it's a lot harder to meet people now. Whoever said that 20s are the best part of our lives...please tell me your secret cause so far they've been ass. I honestly hate being an adult. I miss being young and starry eyed. I miss having opportunities instead of working a lame 9-5. I wish I could reset back to 16 and start it all over again. All that optimism is gone now that realism is starting to set in.

        "text": "I’m 24F and hardly get compliments but I was talking to a cute loss prevention guy at a store today and he told me he liked my shirt and remembered me from a different time I’d been at that store. It seems dumb but it put a smile on my face. It was nice to get a compliment like that no matter how insignificant it probably was for him.  \n\nFor more context on why I was there: I have friends who work at that store but have never really spoken to him directly until today! We introduced ourselves and found out we went to the same high school!",

She thought I was going to be here the whole week (nobody said that).\n\nAnyway she seemed really offensive and I told her I was busy and she interrogated me to the point I had an anxiety attack and admitted I wanted to go home because I have daily panic attacks now and need my routine. She literally continued to interogate me asked me WHEN I get PANICK ATTACKS. Well that dinner ended very awkwardly between me her and her husband.\n\nWe originally planned to watch the super bowl together but I was absolutely shocked at this point so I just stayed in my room instead. I have never known her to go to bed later than 8pm. I came out to get water and saw her sitting i. the dark alone in the dining room at 1:30 in the morning. I have never ever seen her up later than 8pm. Did I just destroy her life or something?",

        "text": "Hello, I'm a 19 year old college dropout.\n\nIt's a long story. I wanted to go into psychology, then stuff went terrible. I had a major depressive slump and couldn't bring myself to go to classes. I was a near complete shut in, only leaving my dorm to eat and to go to work. I like to say I dropped out to save face, but in reality I flunked out, plain and simple. Lot of wasted time and money I say. I say this to emphasize the fact that I've been lost for quite a while, thought I knew what I wanted in psychology, then that fell through and I realized I actually didn't want that for my life.\nI went into a CNC class so I could at least have a job and I like it ok, but it's not what I want to do with the rest of my life.\n\nNow, about a year ago I picked up the bass. I only really started focussing on it around 5 months ago. I don't think I'll ever be professional at it, but it does tie in to what I think I want to do with my life. \n\nI think I want to be a Luthier. Making instruments is extremely interesting to me and I want to learn. Here's where the somebody comes in.\n\nEvery week, I go to a local music store for lessons. It's the same place I bought my bass. They have an in-store Luthier. I don't know much about him but I want to see if I can talk to him and get some insight. I have a lesson tomorrow and I'll see if I muster up the courage to get a word or two in with him if he's there. Just thinking about it gets my anxiety racing but if it's what I have to do I may as well do it.\n\n\n\nSorry if this came out as incomprehensible rants. I am very tired, I haven't slept in a while. I'm not sure if the flair is ok because this post does contain a life story but it's also other stuff too.",

Does anyone else tend to have vacations of more go, go, go as opposed to straight up chilling and taking it light or do you go for a more chill, relaxed type destination?",
