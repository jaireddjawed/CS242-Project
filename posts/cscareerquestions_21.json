        "text": "Graduated with a degree in MIS from a school here in the bay area last summer. After some soul-searching I realized I wasn’t interested in taking my career in IT or data analytics, so I decided to pursue a career in web dev. \n\nI was fortunate enough to be assigned to a project for NASA as a full-stack developer, that’s where I first dipped my toes into web development which lasted from Jan - May 2022. I only started applying to frontend positions in November, since then I’ve gotten only about 2 call-backs. One went extremely well and I passed all their interviews but no offer has been presented yet and it’s been 6 weeks. The recruiter tells me they are waiting on upper management. I had another interview where I was assigned a 24 hour take-home project in React, but I lacked the skills to get it done on time.\n\nIt’s been tough to say the least, I’ve got a few unfinished frontend projects under my belt and I’ve only been learning React for about a month now, so I’m not quite ready to build a full project in React quite yet. I’m trying to stay hopeful but I’m slowly getting squeezed out of my hometown by rent going up and up, and my current job is keeping me here because it’s easy and they pay me ok (51k/yr, extremely low for Bay Area but it beats flipping burgers). I had to sign a new lease at an expensive rate meanwhile my wage has stagnated for 2 years and they refuse to give me a raise. \n\nThis post is a bit of a rant, I’m unhappy with my situation because I’m treated like shit at my job and they are convinced that they are giving me competitive pay. My manager is sleeping with my mom and tells me he loves me after chewing me out over stupid stuff (he’s my dad 😂) I’m ready to move on and start my career, that what I went to college to do. \n\nHere is my resume, feedback and criticism will be highly valued:  https://i.imgur.com/cOE5bqQ.jpg",

I’m a disabled vet (only 27 years old) and my degree is being funded and I have enough funding to cover all the way through a phd program if I choose, so many or education level isn’t much of an issue.\n\nI’ve been dead set on computer science for a long time but the more I look at our shiny new data science program the more intrigued I am. I’m looking to stay in the area (my wife is a lawyer here and we love our family) and either take a remote job or leverage the fact that Walmart is here and try to get hired by them. There’s also a local startup I admire that works mostly with python and geospatial data both of which are covered by the data science program. Unfortunately all of the interesting data science courses require you to be a data science major.\n\nHow do you think the two degree plans look in comparison to each other? Any insight at all is appreciated I know comp sci is generally recommended over data science but specific insights in regard to these degree plans would be great!\n\nData science plan: \n\nhttps://catalog.uark.edu/undergraduatecatalog/collegesandschools/interdisciplinarystudies/datasciencedasc/#bswithcomputationalanalyticsconcentrationtext\n\nComputer science plan:\n\nhttps://catalog.uark.edu/undergraduatecatalog/collegesandschools/collegeofengineering/computerscienceandcomputerengineeringcsce/#baincomputersciencetext",

A lot of my work deals with stakeholder management, client relations, and typical project management stuff. I am also working towards getting my PMP and certifications in stuff like SCRUM, Agile, etc.\n\nMy educational background is in Electrical Engineering. Been brushing up some of my old textbooks and notes from the DSA course and other programming/hardware courses I took while in uni.\n\nSo I was wondering what your thoughts and opinions are on how I can go about trying to make this transition? Am I trying to do something that's dumb? Could I perhaps try for more PM related roles within tech? \n\nI have friends in tech but I don't really want to ask them for potential interviews and job opportunities as I don't think I am that close with them - if that makes sense. So worried if I'm trying for something impractical.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I've always gotten really positive feedback from upper management, peers and my own employees about my communication style - I've had a good track record of creating a safe, friendly team environment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have one employee though who is just kind of a nightmare for me to talk to. I go out of my way to help them, am always available to answer questions, and am always making sure they don't have too much on their plate. At some point during his onboarding, he requested a one hour weekly 1:1, whereas everyone else on the team has the default 30 minute block, and I make time for him anytime he asks for an adhoc meeting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that he has a really standoffish attitude when communicating with me - this started before day 1, and some of this came through even during his interviews, but his technical performance was brilliant and I chalked his communnication issues up to nerves. When we meet (mostly over zoom) his attention seems to drift, and he his body language makes me feel he doesn't value what i'm saying (on zoom, he'll keep looking around his screen, doesn't nod or give me an \"mhm\" to show me he's listening). He goes on these long rants about things he's upset about that often I have no control over. He frequently talks over me and interrupts me even when i'm trying to answer one of his questions. 90% of our 1:1s is just me answering his questions, and I am a pretty high performer myself so normally around the company my input is very highly valued, but seemingly not so to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAFAIK, there haven't been any other complaints about his communication style - I obviously can't observe how he behaves in other 1:1s, but in bigger meetings that we both attend he tends to be camera off, and doesn't say much. Even when called on, he kind of responds in a very shy way. He's completely different than when he's with me (not paying attention to me, ranting, interrupting me etc). The only thing I can think of is that he just doesn't respect managers or authority figures and uses me to kind of vent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is a very high performer, the strongest on my team. During our annual feedback cycle, I was hoping to include some constructive feedback about the above - \"practice active listening to improve our communication, be mindful of your body language, be mindful not to interrupt others). But I'm wondering if I should just ignore it since i don't want to risk demoralizing a high performer on an issue that seems to only affect me.",

Even worse, the pay for any job around my area is practically worthless. This has really been difficult in trying to network and find internships. It’s so bad that I only found one IT internship (unpaid), with the kicker being that I needed to know all about how to set up networks beforehand. Of course I didn’t get the internship, but I feel for whoever did.\n\nSo this brings me to my question: would living in a cheap trailer and working remotely as a SWE be possible? I was thinking about doing this for a year or two so I can pay off my loans and whatnot. The only downside is that I have no work experience related to SWE, just a degree I will earn and some projects. I figure this would be a huge setback in getting me a job, but I keep hearing that all it takes is one “yes” to get your foot in the door.",

I think since I've been looking I've sent out over 400 applications. Maybe the last 50 of those has been with the updated resume I'm using now.   \nAlso I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit. I just don't know what to do.",

        "text": "This is just a rant from an unqualified idiot, I guess. I am *pretty sure* this daily cycle of work halting problems is getting me fired.  \n\nThis is my first dev job. I've been hired by a health insurance company and I'm stuck on a project that actually expects a lot of domain knowledge on my part. We had \"onboarding\" but it was in the form of many 2-4 hour long prerecorded zoom call footage and I struggled to absorb much of it. It doesn't help that we're working on an *mostly undocumented* 20 year-old Spring / JSP codebase. (Actually we've been poorly attempting to analyze/ document it since months before I started. We inherited it from a company we apparently bought out.)\n\nI get some tasks assigned to me. I try my best to figure out what all the Health Insurance jargon means in this context  so I can interpret what's actually being asked of me. I don't mean basic acronyms, I mean, like, someone trying to explain what they want technically with psuedo-technical language using terms like \"Paid Incurred Processed settings\" where it's not quite typical insurance speak and doesn't quite refer to anything specific in the codebase, either.   \n\nI inevitably hit a point where I can't comprehend what I'm reading any more. Straight-up word salad. Looking up more general information online isn't helping. I Send some messages out hoping to get some clarification. Half of the time, no one who actually knows ends up responding. Half of the time that's because they're on the other side of the world and sleeping by then.  \n\nMorning standup next day. \"Actually I have some questions about this story\". The dreaded \"...still working on it\". I have to ask some dumbass question in front of everyone at the end that reveals how little I'm understanding things. If I'm lucky someone hops in a call with me afterwards, usually some vague half-answer that still assumes a lot about what I'm aware of.  \n\nI try to work off of what I was given. Typically sputter to a halt fairly quickly. Cycle repeats.  \n\nI have accomplished next to nothing in the over six months that I've been here.\n\nObviously as a new dev, I'm pretty dense in general and know almost nothing.  But even then this all comes across as a project that you don't toss a bunch of idiot junior devs on.  And now it's looking like the time is coming to cull the excess new hires, and I'm getting the distinct impression that I'm on the list.",

I've been mostly applying for in-person or hybrid positions in the Salt Lake City area, but more recently I've started applying to remote positions from anywhere in the US as well.\n\nFor reference: I don't have any prior internships or work experience, I do have a few projects.\n\n[Resume](https://imgur.com/a/hucrf1j)",

Want to switch into CS\n\nI’m a 23 year old, IT business analyst making about 72k after bonus in a LCOL city, and I am starting to regret my major. \n\nI am doing a data science bootcamp right now and love it. I wanted to get a Masters of Science in Information Systems and Technology or MS in Computer Science. \n\nI am leaning towards a MS in CS since I would enjoy it more, but I feel like it would take longer I would probably have to take some pre reqs and education is expensive. \n\nNot sure what to do…any advice? Would a MS in Infosystems help with tech jobs? Or a MS in CS a better fit?\n\nOr should I do a MS in Information Systems and Technology with a Minor in CompSci?",

        "text": "Hello! Currently I am Full Stack Engineer with 6 YOE working with Angular, and then a 2/2/2 split between .NET Core, NodeJS, and Java for the backend.  \n\n\nIn the middle of last year, my company laid off a large portion of it's international dev workforce in favor of keeping around it's US based employees and retaining a profitable business. Just this week, I was informed that my current project team is getting disbanded due to our client dropping the contract while near project completion and that more cuts would be coming thanks to this. No one knows who is going to be laid off or when. With that being said, I intended to leave this company anyways because I keep getting passed up on promotions due to these layoffs and the fact that my supervisor left the company before I got it and the new manager is ignoring my previous performance reviews. The company feels like a sinking ship and bad things keep popping up over and over that keeps giving us all the fear of being laid off at any moment.  \n\n\nMy current job search isn't really going anywhere. Back in 2020, with only 3 YOE, I was able to apply at about 10 companies and have at least 4 interviews around them resulting in 1 offer. Now I have applied to at least 80-100 companies so far, had 1 multiple choice code test (that I failed miserably lol), 1 phone interview coming up, and a take home test to complete. I am not sure if this is due to the poor market that we are in due to so many companies laying people off, my experience, or my resume. I feel like after 4-6 years of exclusively working under 1 framework that this wouldn't be so difficult but maybe the 2 year backend splits are effecting this? I really want to avoid any type of contract work just due to how volatile the work is.  \n\n\nI have some interest in taking up a React role since that seems to be 70% of the market right now over Angular but even though Angular and React are similar, I think hiring managers are passing me up due to having no significant experience working with it other than a 3 month contract that I had previously. How do people switch roles like this without taking a major pay cut?  \n\n\nAnyways, my mind has been all over the place since receiving the layoff news and am being a complete hypochondriac about it, fearing the worst that I could go homeless or something stupid like that...and I am not an anxious person at all.  \n\n\nI've attached screenshots of a heavily redacted version of my resume here if anyone would be willing to give some suggestions or tell me it's really bad.   \n[https://imgur.com/a/nJqXERL](https://imgur.com/a/nJqXERL)  \n\n\nAlso any suggestions that could possibly make my job search a little easier that would be great. I am mostly leveraging LinkedIn and recruiters atm but have tried Otta with no luck.  \n\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! Thanks!",

        "text": "I'm a mid-level engineer between jobs with a lot of free time so I agreed to create a website for some friends who are starting a small business. The website isn't too complicated but has taken me a fair amount of time because I wanted to do it right. The tech stack is react, express, and postgres. Landing page is a medium-sized form that users fill out, followed by an employee-only overview of all the open submissions, followed by another employee-only page with a medium-sized form with data required for finalizing a given submission. There's another major piece that needs to be built. I'm nearly complete with the first iteration, here's what I've added:\n\n* Unit testing client and server input validation\n* development and production environments on digital ocean.\n* CI/CD pipelines\n* kubernetes cluster to handle front-end and back-end services\n* automated emails for notifying users of updates to their submission\n* google-sign in with user authentication\n\nMy question to the community, and I'm sorry if I've been too vague for y'all to answer (partially intentional), is how much is this worth? I'm being given 1k cash and they've asked me to join the company as founder or CTO (I don't care so much about titles) with 1% stake in the company. I'd be the only developer because the very small team doesn't have a tech background.\n\nUp to this point I've thought of the website as a favor to my friends and an opportunity to learn some new technologies, however, any development after this I would like to be compensated correctly. I make low six figures so they couldn't afford a salary or hourly rate, really stock options is the only way they could compensate me. While this website isn't the focal point of their business it certainly couldn't survive without it. 1% sound really low but I don't want to take advantage of my friends or hurt their business, I just want to make sure this is worth my time and effort. Can anyone who's been in a similar situation give me advice as to what a reasonable ask would be?",
