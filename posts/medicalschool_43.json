I have been  trying to get seen by a provider to get started on a prescription but I  wasn't able to get an appointment until after my exam.\n\nI just feel awful right now. I know mental health isn't taken seriously sometimes and last time I met with the academic committee, they brushed off my comments about it. Should I tell them about my diagnosis? I'm afraid they won't take it seriously again or they will just think that I  shouldn't be at the institution because of it. I'm not sure what to do anymore.",

Ideally id go straight after grade 12, but realistically id take a gap year, prepare for the mcat and then go the following year. \n\nIm unsure of how smart that pathway would be, how hard it is,  and how much it would cost. Ive heard that some medical schools in europe are either cheaper than canada or free. Is that true? And does anyone have any advice as to how to accomplish that? \n\nIm taking all 3 sciences this year but next year im dropping physics because i cannot handle the stress of 3 sciences + double math. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!!",

        "text": "Hey yall, Im an M1 at a USMD school that just started looking into research. Im interested in surgery in general, with the most competitive thing Im into being Ortho. \n\nProblem is, my school's Ortho dept is pretty difficult to get involved in research as a student. Im chasing some leads to get on a project but there's no telling when/if I could.\n\nI have an opportunity to do outcomes research in a general surgery subspecialty with a student research group that pumps out posters/abstracts/presentations and gets everyone on each others' pubs.\n\nMy question is, should I take this opportunity while I keep looking for something ortho specific? I recognize applying to residencies is a numbers game when it comes to research, but I wasn't sure if it'd hurt my potential Ortho app to have gen surg research.\n\nIm pretty new to doing research in general so any advice or perspectives would help a ton",

I was wondering for those programs I can't find through the application portal, will they eventually open up applications trough the VSOL? Or if they are currently not there now, do we have to reach out to them individually? \n\nAlso, are applications all submitted at the same time? Or is it temporal, like rotations for dates in October will open later this year? I am asking because there are some programs that only have dates in late april and I would still be in my clerkships. So I am wondering if that means that institutions will not be hosting aways this year or if I just need to wait until they open up applications.",

I was given an extra semester to catch up on basic credits and I couldn't add too many rotations to my study plan this semester.  \nSo this semester (half of the year) I've had Gen Surg with urology for 3.5 weeks, radiology for 2.5 weeks.. ANd thats it  \nMy other subjects are \"scientific reasoning\" \"Medicine and society\" \"Georgian language\" \"PBL Cases\".. which don't occupy so much time.  \nI passed my rotations with flying colours. I still have another 3 years of clinical after this semester so I'm in no press or hurry to study. Our finals are semester to semester, so no huge exam (Just many more exams per semester).  \nI'm just on fifa all the time. Bit depressing.  I did some extra studying but then meh. Sometimes I resist comiting to new skills or hobbies because as soon as my next rotations drop I will have barely enough time to go to the toilet. And then will have to drop it. Like I do MMA or kick boxing and then have to abandon it for a long time.\n\n My future semesters I won't have near as much free time (another 23 or so rotations for the next 3 years), but in between rotations I probably will have a bit of free time inbetween rotations.  \n\n\nI feel like every response someone will have a different approach, but thats perfect for me.

Previously I did Uworld for clerkships at the beginning of last year (psych, obgyn) then switched to amboss up until November/December at which point I did ambulatory and family med on Uworld (scoring in the 80s, 92 on the FM shelf). I had only done a total of maybe 1800 Uworld questions and most of them were almost a year ago. \n\nIm just wondering if I’m scoring as high as I am now because I remember specific questions or not. I don’t recognize anything except the occasional FM question since that was recent. Just wanting to know how predictive this is gonna be.",
