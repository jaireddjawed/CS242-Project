        "text": "1. The recipe says to let the knots rise until they double, but the recipe for the new York style pizza dough says to let the dough rise as well.  Does this mean that you have to let the dough rise twice? Is pizza dough even able to do that, or does it max out at some point?\n\n2. I have a 12\" skillet, but the recipe calls for a 10\". Do I just make extra to completely fill the skillet, or can I use the original recipe and just leave some extra space in the skillet? \n\n3. My food processor is pretty small. How would I knead the dough in batches? Do I knead in small batches, check if it passes the windowpane taste, then just mush all the dough into one ball? \n\nYour comments are appreciated, I'm a complete pizza noob by the way lol",

By adding sodium citrate, instead of melting into a grease slick the processed cheese will stay in emulsion and melt into gooeyness. \n\nIf left to cool it then solidifies into gum. \n\nAdd more water to this recipe and you have cheese sauce. Or switch the cheeses up and make the next Provel.  Using a different blend of cheeses, it makes [the worlds best macaroni and cheese](http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/silky-smooth-macaroni-and-cheese/). \n\nSodium citrate can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Grade-Non-GMO-Sodium-Citrate/dp/B00PKHAQDY) for cheap. \n\nI have yet to make pizza with it but I did create a sandwich using it: The St. Loubano. Italian bread, red sauce, Provel cheese, pepperoncini, Genoa salami, Missouri ham, barbecue pork steak and made according to [Serious Eat's Cubano recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/cuban-sandwich-recipe.html).\n\n**Homemade Provel**\n\n* 500 g provolone\n* 250 g Swiss\n* 250 g white cheddar\n* 300 g water\n* 36 g sodium citrate\n* 1/2 tsp liquid smoke (ended up being too much)\n\n1. Shred the cheese.\n2. Mix the water, sodium citrate, and liquid smoke over medium heat until bubbling.\n3. Add the shredded cheese a handful at a time, mixing until melted before adding more.\n4. Mix like the dickens when you've added the last bit of cheese. Don't use a blender like me. This cheese is too thick.\n5. Pour into a container to congeal.\n\nEdit: Baking soda and citric acid, in place of sodium citrate, worked for me just now using 200 grams of cheese. 5.25 grams of citric acid dry mixed with 6.25 grams of baking soda, then added to the water.\n\nEdit 2: I made [smashburgers tonight with Provelveeta](http://imgur.com/a/gOSQ5) (a mashup of Velveeta &amp; Provel ingredients, namely colby, provolone, Swiss, and cheddar)",

        "text": "So I made the pan pizza for the first time last night and it was absolutely delicious.  \n  \n  The only thing that threw me off was when he said to make it into a ball. My dough was really sticky and there was no way that stuff was turning into a ball. Most of it seemed to just end up on my fingers...I did flour them but I guess the dough just kind of ate it up.  \n  \n  Am I correct to assume that I should have just added some flour to it to dry it up a bit? Is it a problem with my measurements, or is okay to adjust the day that you're making the pizzas...or do I have to do it on the first day when I'm initially making the dough (before it expands and stuff)?  \n  \n  I mean it turned out fine so it wasn't a big deal, it was just really annoying to work with and I feel like I lost a ton of dough by having to wipe my fingers with paper towels because of the huge chunks of dough stuck on them.  \n  \n  Any advice would be great! I'm not great with dough/baking in general.  \n  \n  And disclaimer: I don't own a scale. I know, I know, I'm horrible. I'm not blaming the recipe, and I'm sure having a scale would solve the problem, but money is tight and this pizza is literally the only baking I do, so yeah...one day.",

I regularly cook for meat eating friends who either flat out don't notice or don't care that they aren't eating meat. In the Midwest that is a big step.\n\nLast night I made the Kenji's vegetarian bean chili, which is extraordinary.  I had some friends over, one of whom commented on the fact that I had started eating meat again. I told him I hadn't and asked what he meant. He pointed to the chili and said \"this has meat in it\". I said \"no it doesn't\". Then we went abiut three more rounds with him getting angry. I showed him the recipe and he still didn't believe me. He actually went through my trash and found the chickpea cans. He left befuddled.\n\nThanks Kenji you make my life as a vegetarian better and decidedly more entertaining.",

So a better recommendation for chorizo would be great. Also, my potatoes were *CRAZY* salty! I checked the recipe over and over to make absolutely sure it was supposed to be 2 tablespoons of salt.

The big question I have is if the pressure cooker time I have is correct. I've never done pork shoulder (or any pork) in the pressure cooker so I'm not sure how long it will take to get the pull-apart-tender consistency.

        "text": "Last night I reverse seared a top sirloin that was about 1.75\" thick.  I cooked it at 250 for 45 minutes until 120 and then seared it in stainless steel for like two minutes per side.  There was no fat cap to render, which may have contributed to one of the two issues from below:\n\nTwo questions:\n\nFirst, my steak came out nearly perfectly in terms of the meat but the fat itself was still abundant and tough.  Any way to avoid this?  Should I have cooked it to more than 120?\n\nSecond, my meat did seem to \"bloom\", which /u/j_kenji_lopez-alt referenced in his video with Adam Savage.  Why does it do that?  If I left it to rest a minute longer would it have bloomed in the moment rather than on the plate?\n",

The Serious Eats post used testing to show that mortar &amp; pestle gave better results than using a food processor.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut in the book The Food Lab, the recommendation is to use a food processor. A mortar and pestle is mentioned only in passing, and nothing about its superiority as to taste is discussed. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy is The Food Lab cookbook disregarding the research on pesto on its own blog?\n",

It's a problem because it's extremely difficult to browse such a large recipe book on the Kindle app - it's slow and clunky to get to the next recipe, for instance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAny chance of this being fixed?\n",

Thinking of serving at about 5 or 6 (seven hours from now).\n\nThinking about dropping them in an ice bath at some point and then putting them in a cold (160-180) smoker for a few hours over apple, pecan or white oak.  Finishing over charcoal.\n\nAny advice on:\n\n1. How long to smoke them (min/max)?\n1. Which type of wood?\n",
