But I've been seeing people saying other things about her, that she's a \"self-loathing brown girl,\" that she's transphobic, that she's conservative (meanwhile conservatives are saying Velma is too \"woke\"), and I just don't really understand what's going on or where any of it is coming from.  \n  \nI have very low investment in the drama, but someone I know and respect has recommended her shows to me so I'm curious what all the hubbub is about and if there's anything to any of it, or if it's just that dragging people on Twitter has become our national pastime.  \n  \nLike, are people upset because she has White love interests in her shows? What's the deal with her brother pretending to be Black, and has Mindy ever like come out and defended that (assuming it's true)? Why are people saying she's transphobic? Why are people posting \"she's a terrible person\" and \"Mindy being Mindy\" implying she's bad as an accepted fact?",
