Along the way I mention I'm a people pleaser and how my heart drops at the thought I did something wrong and how I constantly apologies.   But with this I started talking about ngram and what she put me though.  The one thing I say as I talk about he is that if my ngram had a personality disorder I wouldn't be the least bit surpise.  My therapist agreed with me.  It was just such a thank you moment.   I really feeling as I can be more open and honest.  Also last time I was there a plastic plant was next to me and I fidgeted with the leaves a lot this time I didn't (I'm a nervous fidgetuer).  Grant this only second time with her but I'm very confident.   ",

From birth, I haven't been able to see or hear them, but I feel their presence, and they've reminded me that they're there constantly over the years because from the time I could understand the concept of actions and consequences, every time I exposed the back of my neck, there's a 40% chance this invisible person is going to jab at the end of my hairline with a needle. \n\nIf you were growing up in that situation, eventually, you'd start walking holding your shoulders up to your ears to avoid exposing yourself to pain you know is eventually coming. Everyone you meet would see you hunched and just kind of accept it and not ask you anything about it. \n\nOf course you *know* they notice. How could they not? \n\nEventually, while you're in full hunch, someone wants to know you closer and they ask about it, and you know you can't tell them about the invisible needle-jabber because it's utterly insane that you would be carrying this burden around, so you brush it off with something like \"Ha ha. That's just always how I've been, you know?\" even though you know that's not how you want to be, and that's not how you really are on the rare occasions you're relaxed and confident, but you're so used to the stiff movements of trying to avoid the needle that you don't know any other way to be.\n\nI'm trying to learn how to let my shoulders down, to be comfortable letting myself be more exposed around people. It's so hard because even the most minor of rejection/dismissal from someone else or smallest conversational faux pas on my part is such a deep personal cut after having to internalize that my own mother doesn't even want me because, allegedly, I'm not good enough. \n\nIt's a rough road to recovery, man. I'm low on hope, but I'm trudging through it. I'm basically clinging to other people's stories and praying to any god that will listen that it's worth it in the end. Thanks to everyone who shares their accomplishments in dealing with this mess. You the real MVPs.",

Please let me know if I'm not following any of the rules. :) \n\nI went NC with my older sister around 2.5 years ago after years of emotional abuse, I finally snapped when she got physical. She has gone NC with our parents (dad, Nstepmom and Nmom) who are all in another country. She is married with 2 kids. We live in the same city. I'm not married but am in a long term relationship. Have been for the 2.5 years - me meeting my SO was actually the breaking point for our relationship. \n\nLong story short, she thought 25 year old me shouldn't be sleeping over my boyfriend's place because we met 2 weeks prior. Lectured me for 2 hours on my birthday and when I refused to listen to the lecture, hit me. Few more things happen later and I decide to leave the house I was renting from Nsister and move to a new place. I asked for space, I got \"hope your (female genitalia) gets sore after fucking that (r-word) looking man\" and \"you're fat and ugly and I guess that's the best you'll get anyway\". Nsister then proceeded to go to boyfriend's workplace and best friend's house demanding where I was. She obviously wasn't listening to me asking for space, so I filed a restraining order. We got an official no contact order. I've been NC since. She thinks I wanted to put her nursing career in jeopardy by filing for the restraining order and is convinced she won that lawsuit. I just wanted some space. A bit drastic but I needed space to heal and be okay and figure out who I am without the abuse and I couldn't have her storming people I knew for information on me. \n\nI continue to struggle with not being in my nephews' life. And her life. I know I probably just like the idea of a family (we didn't exactly grow up in the best of family situations - I can elaborate if needed), and more - the idea of a sister. But I also know she's not exactly good for me either. \n\nI need help being okay with not having them in my life. Can you guys point to any resources that I can use? ",

I have a coworker who's confided in me enough to be open about the trouble she's been having within her marriage. I am thankful of the fact that she feels she can trust me enough to do so. I make sure to provide her with my undivided attention without ever giving advice, but I'm starting to feel weighed down by her problems and stressed out because I've found myself committed to hearing her out now. \n\nIsnt this what a friend is supposed to do though? If one can't open up to me what kind of friend would I be?\n\nWell today I've told her that talking to her is started to get in the way of my work output (which is true), but in reality I'm beginning to feel burdened by her openness to communicate her problems with me.\nThe conflict I feel within myself is my wanting to set boundaries but at the same time I want her to feel like she can confide in me still cause I value her friendship.\n\nIn previous friendships and romantic relationships, I've allowed myself to become the type of person they can trust in this manner but I also feel trapped in their expectations of me to do so. This causes me to head for the hills, burn every bridge, and never look back, but I don't want to be this way anymore.\n\nI think my problem stems from my inability to set boundaries, but how do I do so without feeling guilty?\n\nThank you for reading",

I’ve started to figure out what has actually happened in my childhood instead of the stories I was told, and have been getting back memories. Though it’s been good for me, it’s been extremely hard. I may feel more secure in my decision to leave, but I feel I am now confronted with things I’ve buried for a long time. \nI finally see how bad it really was, and things keep being added to the list. After being in treatment for PTSD before, I can honestly say this has been harder. I’ve been having nightmares, flashes, and I dissociate heavily. \n\nI have a great partner, who is very supportive and understanding, and who I love. But now that I’m struggling, I’ve started to specifically notice men who would be a terrible decision. Not that they’re interested in me, or that I am chasing them, not at all. I am noticing them, when before I never looked at other men. The type of men I used to date, or men that are plain impossible (due to power imbalance). I feel terrible for even noticing them, and I know it’s not because I don’t love him. I’ve never really opened up to someone before and my partner is the first person. Now that I’m going through these painful things (relieving child abuse, things my parents did) I find it hard to be around someone who knows so much about me and I can’t hide my feelings from. I feel guilty for being sad most days, and I sometimes feel panicked because of all I’ve shared and opened up. I feel distant with a lot of people when times are tough, but I mostly feel it with him and it makes me so sad when it happens. \n\nMy psychologist told me once that the abuse was made normal to me, and genuine kindness seems abnormal to me because of it. I don’t trust it because genuine kindness wasn’t something I grew up with. I dated people who were like my parents because it was the norm to me, and even though I was miserable, it was comfortable. She said that it takes time to make the abnormal (kindness) the normal again. My partner has never let me down, and has always supported me. I feel extremely guilty for even thinking about others, specifically when they’re so obviously wrong. It just seems comforting. Even though I’d never act on it, I feel like a terrible partner. I would talk to my therapist about it but I’d feel ashamed for talking about my partner like that. \n\nIs this just me or does this make sense to anyone else too? \n",

        "text": "More reflection.\n\nI ran into the guy I've been trying very hard to get over and I noticed my response as I was talking to him.  I clammed up hard, not unlike someone who experiences anxiety talking to someone they're attracted to who they're interested in who DIDN'T go through our situation - who may even be securely attached.\n\nThis was in part also spurred by this article:  https://byrslf.co/am-i-undateable-and-other-fears-834abe16a4d6\n\nBut here's where the catch-22 comes in:\n\n1) I clam up hard around men I'm attracted to.  This puts 'em off.\n\n2) I clam up hard because I get attracted to men rarely, and because I'm terrified.\n\n3) I'm psychologically well enough that I don't get attracted to abusive men.  I do, however, get rejected faaaaaaaaaaaaaar more than most people I know.\n\n4) In middle and high school I was definitely that kid described in the article above, though not quite as isolated:\n\n&gt; In hindsight, there were probably justifiable reasons for my lack of suitors: I had other priorities, and I didn’t conform to the social norms of high school. I wore no makeup and slapped my hair in a ponytail every day; I carried a giant three-inch binder in the crook of my arm everywhere I went; and I never hung out with anyone outside of school because my first love was homework. But instead of ascribing the lack of male attention I received to my lifestyle choices, I internalized it and assumed something was inherently wrong with me.\n\n&gt; After a while, I concluded I was by definition “not desirable”, and learned to occupy a platonic space in everyone’s lives, outside of the dating pool. The way I saw it, everyone had an internal switch labeled “Potential Romantic Interest:”, and mine must have been switched to ‘No’ from birth.\n\nI am now a well-performing PhD student who takes care to look in-shape and attractive and think I'm good-looking, at least when I look at myself in the mirror and look at other people, both with my own eyes and in the mirror.  People have been extraordinarily confused when I tell them I'm not dating anybody.  I have a lot of good friends and a social circle large enough to give me a reputation as a social hub by multiple people who don't know each other.  I am still fucking awkward (and in fact, about 25% of the in-shape and attractive schtick is to compensate for this), and among those who know me well, I have an actual reputation for having the absolute worst luck at dating.  A handful of my friends do know I'm a child abuse survivor and am cutting off my parents.  A handful more don't know, but have picked up on the fact that something is amiss, including the guy I'm trying to get over, who is not terribly close but asked me yesterday if I was alright when I ran into him, because apparently when I am academically doing well and socially doing well the upwelling of fear and sadness and negative emotion I feel when preparing to cut off my parents (which I want and need to do, but which nevertheless provokes a great deal of fear at being without any family, having to rely on friends, and not knowing how strong my safety net is as well as making my grief about never really having loving parents far more salient) **shows nevertheless**.\n\n5) Being raised by a BPD/NPD mother and enabler father (who was almost certainly personality-disordered himself, or at least very mentally ill) has resulted in having to fix (which I have mostly done) some major attachment problems.\n\n6) Whenever I am faced with a man I find attractive, the thoughts that run through my head, regardless of whether I know they're not true or whether I have any evidence for them, are\n\n* \"Oh god I'm awkward.\"\n* \"Oh god I'm pathetic.\"\n* \"Oh god I'm not cool.\"\n* \"I'm socially his inferior.\"\n* \"He's more calm and collected.\"\n* \"He's more popular and more well-liked, especially by people with more social status around here.\"\n* \"He just generally enjoys more social status.\"\n* \"He thinks all of the above about me.\"\n* \"I might not even be good-looking enough for him?\"\n\nand other things that make me feel like between the two of us, I'm the one-down.\n\nThis results in me basically having anxiety through the fucking roof and being somewhat unable to carry on a conversation that is anything other than awkward, and the best conversations I have had with such men often required alcohol to be involved.  Not that they, of course, got anywhere.\n\n7) This is remarkably reminiscent of my B/NPD mother's historical attempts to make me 'fit in'.  Which, weirdly, I do better now after healing from her abuse and from fighting her than I ever did from any of her efforts.  Interestingly, my mother is frumpy and not well-liked and doesn't have many friends, last I checked, and she attempted to impose her horrible fashion sense on me as a child and did things that resulted in me being an overweight, unhealthy, rather sedentary child when I was a kid (I am no longer any of those things).  She has no sex life with my father.  I am not certain either of them were ever all that attracted to each other, if at all.  They got engaged after six weeks of dating, they abuse each other, and I never overheard them having sex in the time I lived in their house.  I know they are not still married because of anything resembling love for each other, nor do I think they ever were during my lifetime.  They should have divorced when I was a toddler.\n\n8) Consequently, given all this, given that I have an awful awful past wherein the reason I never got the men I was attracted to was a combination of unloving parents (and consequent attachment issues, which as I said are probably 90-95% of the way to fixed) + awful presentation + vicious cycle of rejection begetting rejection, and wherein my dating history consists solely of two two-year relationships with men I wasn't even attracted to (because I erroneously thought I had to take what I could get since I felt I couldn't get what I wanted back then) as well as casual sex with men I wasn't even attracted to, **how the flying hell am I supposed to suddenly change course and actually 1) internalize that I'm capable of attracting a man I'm attracted to 2) not freak the fuck out internally around men I'm attracted to and consequently act like a fucking gibbering idiot 3) actually attract them in a way that makes it obvious that I'm succeeding at it 4) establish an actual goddamn healthy relationship that includes mutual attraction?**\n\nBecause I know this is what I have to do.\n\nIt feels like I've got to climb fucking Olympus Mons, dude, complete with developing a spacecraft capable of getting me to Mars, financing the entire thing myself, learning to pilot it, getting to Mars safely, and then climbing the goddamn volcano and getting back to Earth.",

        "text": "I grew up in the rural US, in Trump-land. My family were abusive, but it took me well over a decade after escaping before I could even admit that to myself. Because it was all gaslighting and emotional abuse. They were the sort of people that if I ever complained would loudly tell me that since they weren't beating me or sexually abusing me than I had nothing to complain about.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I would beg to go to things in other towns--I was very \"into\" live music and especially punk bands back then. But my family lived so far out in the middle of nowhere that even if I found out there was going to be a show (usually at a college, anywhere from a 40-60 minute drive from my parents' house), I was usually not allowed to go. I didn't have a car, and wasn't allowed to work or date. \n\nThe thing that rings in my head lately is that part of my begging *always* included me saying that \"I wanted to make friends\". The white trash high school I went to was so small that my graduating high school class had 68 people, for 3 surrounding towns. I was bullied ruthlessly. I was overweight and the favorite bullying tactic was for the \"popular\" kids to moo like a cow when I walked by them in the hall, and then the followers would all laugh.\n\nSo...friends in my high school was not really a thing. But me saying that I wanted to \"make friends\" was this weird trigger for my parents. They would mock me. And the thing that keeps ringing through my head is that they would always say, \"What do you need friends for, you have *us*\". And they were dead serious. They were pretty clear that they expected me to stay there and never leave them.\n\nI escaped by playing to my mother's narcissism. She would be \"humiliated\" if all her kids didn't go to college, so I stubbornly refused to apply for any in-state schools. I applied to colleges in the nearest big city, a 3 hour drive, 3 states away. I ran off with the first boyfriend I found, and moved 3/4 of the way across the country.\n\nNow I'm an adult. 42 years old. And I still can't make friends for shit. I spent a solid 15 years clinging to abusive, codependent relationships. It was serial monogamy, for years I moved from one guy to the next with almost no breaks in between. I think the first guy was a coping mechanisim to escape from my family, but I kept going with it long beyond the usefulness. When I could support myself and the guys were doing me more harm than good. That ended with an abrupt dumping at the end of 2011. In all those years, I barely made any friends, I just tried to be friends with whoever my boyfriends' friends were.\n\nI was mostly single for a few years, and am soon going to be celebrating 4 years with a kind, decent man.\n\nWe're long past the \"honeymoon\" kind of stage of the relationship, and I'm trying to focus my energy on making friends. Because depending on one person for all of one's emotional needs isn't healthy. And...I'm terrible at making friends. The last few years I'd been focused on a new job and dealing with some medical issues. I'm starting to get a grip on both of those.\n\nSo now I've been trying to be social. And I'm coming up against my fleas so hard. Or at least I hope it's fleas. I hope I can fix this.\n\nThere are a bunch of things that have been going on. One is, I've been trying to de-clutter my apartment, so I sent a casual email to someone I considered a good friend (who now lives out of state) offering her some expensive things I was getting rid of that I thought she'd like, as she's a poor artist type. I did also write \"NBD if you don't want these\", but what I didn't expect was that the next day she posted this cryptic instagram post that was very likely \"vaguebooking\" about me negatively. But, not really specific and plausably deniable. And now it's been weeks and she didn't reply, even to say \"thanks, but no\".\n\nI keep on trying to talk to people about this and that's a flea too (IRL, not in the context of an internet support group). It's not just that I now realize she didn't like me nearly as much as I liked her. It's that in these last few years of being antisocial and mostly thinking about my health and my job, I held onto these fantasies about the people I wanted to be friends with. But like the abusive ex-boyfriends, my fantasies about the situation aren't rooted in reality. So now I'm grieving the loss of this friendship that I should never have even fantasized was a real friendship.",

Part of the deal was that I was given permission to handle where it would be in the exhibition hall as long as it was not taking up any walls (it could be in the middle area, back or front, it was to be *my choice*). \n\nSo I asked an Nfriend to help me since it was pretty large. We were setting this up a couple days before the exhibit opened. On our way down, I explained to him that the director and I had an agreement but it felt like she was being pretty pushy about things and over-exerting control, regardless of the agreement. I said \"I'm glad you're going, so I can have a wing-man with me.\"\n\nThe director of the organization was on hand to \"OK\" things once we got it set up, so I called her in to see if she was good with where I chose. My Nfriend was standing there watching us and taking some pictures of various things while we were discussing the position. But the director was pushing for it to be in a different place, so we talked about it for a while. It felt like the director was sort of reneging on our deal because she kept trying to get me to move it to the other side of the hall and there was some back and forth. At the end, trying to be accommodating a bit, I said I'd look for a good compromise and call her back in later. Then the director looked over at my Nfriend and said \"What do you think? Is this a good position?\" and my Nfriend said \"I think your idea is better.\"  And he smiles this big smile. \n\nWell, Nfriend has a history of simply saying \"Yes\" to whatever any woman wants, in order to manipulate them. So much for my wing-man. It sort of felt like betrayal because by that time the director had called in her assistant and I felt like it was three against one. I was stressed a bit and not happy about what he said, so after the two org people left, I went silent on him for a while. We were tearing the display down to move it and he asked what was wrong. I told him I was hoping that he'd back me up a bit more instead of just agreeing with her, a total stranger to him. \n\nWell, for some reason, that really pissed him off and he said that I was acting just like [ a notorious N person who holds the highest office in the USA currently ] and I knew he said it just to make me angry because he knows I can't stand \"the D\". I was already stressed about the whole thing anyway and that didn't help. So, I just went silent. Then, after studying things for a while, I said that it might look better in the very middle and he had the suggestion of facing it a different way. So, in total silence, we tried it and it looked much better than either of the earlier suggestions or positions. So, I said \"Great, your suggestion was good, this is going to work.\" I was hoping it would cheer him up a bit, but nope, he's still angry. OK...\n\nSo, I call the director back in, she approves of it and is happy and we're good to go. I knew that my truth and what I said to Nfriend had made him mad, so I was prepared to apologize. We tore down the display and loaded it back into the car (I needed to do some things to it and then bring it back) and when we got in the car, I looked over and said \"Hey, I need to apologize to you, I was just stressed and I said something I didn't really mean. I'm sorry.\"  Response?  Barely a recognition of my apology and silence.  OK.\n\nSo, we're driving and because I'm not getting much response and he seems mad still, I try again. This Nfriend's backstory is that he didn't have any friends growing up, didn't have any through college and now was in middle age and was just starting to have friends. We met a while ago through an organization and struck up a friendship over common interests. I was thinking: OK, due to a lack of friends his whole life, he's never had to be a wing-man before and so maybe he doesn't realize when it's best to be a \"back-up guy\" when another person needs it. And I verbalized this to him, which somehow made him even madder. And I was saying how the director had said something that was stressing me out because she seemed like she was backing out of our deal, sort of explaining my position with her because Nfriend didn't know about our agreement. I was hoping he'd see why I was stressed, since this was a big deal for me.\n\nAnd then he says: \"No, she didn't say that, I know.\" And I said, \"How do you know?\"\n\nAnd he says: \"Because I secretly recorded your whole conversation\".  \n\nOne part of my brain heard that and the other part just kept talking like nothing was wrong, but meanwhile inside I'm thinking \"WHAT????  THE???? FUCK????\"  He recorded things without my consent or knowledge. Because... why???\n\nSo, we were going to have lunch and as we got closer to the restaurant he says that he doesn't want to be around me right now. And I'm sort of still reeling, so I said OK and just drove him to his car and we said \"bye\".  \n\nAs I started to think about it, I realized more and more how weird it was for him to do that. And then I started wondering \"When else has he done this?\" because we'd had a lot of conversations where I'd told him very intimate stuff about my relationship, my family, etc. because I had felt a real connection with this person. I thought we could be good friends. And it's very hard to create new friendships at middle age. He had stressed during our developing friendship how much he appreciated having a friend, how much he enjoyed our conversations, etc. \n\nI have a history of being stalked and abused (he knew this) and this was triggering me BIG TIME.\n\nThat night, I just felt duped. And there was absolutely NO possible reason for him to have done this, it had no use whatsoever, it was just a discussion about a display position. So I emailed him and asked him why he did it and how odd it felt to me. I said that it seemed very \"stalkerish\" and I felt like it was something that a good friend would never do, especially without permission and in secret. I asked if he'd done it before.\n\nFirst, in his reply, he totally blew it off as if it was just a normal thing and not to worry about it. And then in the same email, he said that he resented how I was trying to make him look evil and that it really hurt his feelings that I was trying to paint him as a bad guy somehow.\n\nI have asked two other friends and they said to basically drop this guy as a friend, that he can't be trusted. So, after realizing how much this creeped me out, I did. But he's written two emails since trying to convince me that I'm wrong and that we should still be friends like before. \n\nIs it wrong to secretly record a conversation of two people? \n\nDoes this seem like a total violation of the basic rules of friendship to anyone out there? \n\nDoes it seem like this guy has some major issues or am I in the wrong here?  \n\nOpinions?\n\nTLDR: Nfriend secretly records me and then tries to convince me that it's OK and not creepy.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I just want to tell my story, because I thought about it, and it pissed me off all over again.\n\nLast year in January my best \"friend\" of 15 years cut contact with me put of the blue qhen I was prego, then 3 weeks later, I lost my child. She couldn't be bothered to contact me in the hospital, nor did she show up for the funeral, nor could ahe even give me a fuck you text. \n\nRight before this, she wanted and begged to do an RP with me. We started it, but she would let it die and then I would go and have to remind her. In the end, she told me my writing was too aggressive (whatever that means, I still don't know) and didn't want to write with me anymore. I ended up deleting the account she asked me to make right after I went back on to find out it was a competitive game with her (she had this habit of setting up competitions between us, but I would always end up winning them even though I didn't know we were playing, or at least that I was being forced to play).\n\nBefore that, her brother (another narc) tried to commit suicide, and then blamed me for being a bad friend for saving him, and she fucking agreed??? Mind you, she was mainly pissed because she didn't call the police first, and ignored her brothers call, while I was prego freaking out cause I thought my friend was gonna die, so I don't understand that one.\n\nBefore I got prego, we were cool, but once I was prego and past the 12 week mark, she would ignore me or disregard everything I said unless it was about my daughter. For some reason,  everything about me but my baby was an annoyance for her.\n\nBefore that, for her son's first birthday, she completely ignored my husband and I and refused to open the present we got her sonnin front of friends.and family (joke was on her, because the truck we got her son became his favorite toy) and didn't once speak to us once.\n\nBefore that, she would call to tell me I wasn't being a good enough friend to her...even though I always drove down to visit her when she refused, or paid for food because she didn't want to work (not that she couldn't, she just didn't. ), or that I needed to spend more time with her or else she would find someone else to hang out with. She also said my husband might not be good for me again (please see below for WHY again is important) and told me that I should leave him in order for us to hanf out like old times. She laughed but I didn't find it funny.\n\nBack in 2014, my husband was in jail for a year, and she wanted me to leave him and be ijn a relationship with her. Then she started trying to make rules: I have to tell my parents immediately we're together--not after a year. Not six months, not even a week. Immediately. My father is a pastor, so no.--i have to accept contracting herpes in order to be with her, I can't talk about my mental issues with her because \"she has problems of her own.\" \n\nEnded up telling her \"thanks but nah.\" And then two weeks later she was engaged to some dude who she stole from another chick and got hitched to him. Then she got knocked up a month later. Acted like I should have been jealous of her marriage, even though I had been with my husband about 5 years at that time.\n\nEverything before that was just bullshit that I don't even want to get into.  But for anyone who wants to know, a narc will ghost you for trying to have a life and then make you seem like the bad guy for not idolozing them. I actually grew up with a family of narcs, but she didn't know that. That's my only saving grace.\n\nIdk what I wanted to do with this, but I needed to get it out. It a been over a year, and I just want to scream to the top of the world \"F$@K YOU, BITCH \"\n\nTHATS ALL.",

        "text": "One thing I've found in my healing process is that wounds sustained in relationship are going to be healed in relationship.  That person may be a therapist, that person may be a friend.\n\nI have a friend who sees the same therapist I do.  She was also raised by someone who is either NPD or BPD with narcissistic tendencies.  She and I have had a lot to talk about.  (I actually have a few friends like this, it turns out - decent people raised by horrible people.)\n\nShe is also, I have realized over time, in a worse place than I am psychologically, and figuring out where she is has given me a great deal of perspective on where I am.  It often takes interacting with others who have been through much the same situation to figure out where you are on the path.\n\nI do not get into relationships with or tolerate abusive people, and do not to my knowledge have any abusive people in my life (other than the N/uBPD mother I am about to cut out of my life).  She, unfortunately, is worse off than I am - she has been in a tumultuous, abusive, on-and-off relationship with a guy who works in the same lab she does, who is - the therapist has told her - probably borderline/narcissistic himself.\n\nI sat there and mostly bit my tongue as I heard her talk about how much she wasn't ready to cut him off and about how much she just wanted him to come back (he had left her) and about how much she was trying to help him to change (he's not going to, even though he apparently did try to read a book about dialectical behavioral therapy once) and about how she was stuck in the ups and downs of what I informed her, gently, was a cycle of abuse and about how she described things that I immediately recognized as her falling victim to hoovering.\n\nI want so badly to tell her I see clear as day what she's not extricating herself from, and I've tried my best to do so in the most effective way I can think of, but I don't know if it IS the most effective way.\n\nAnd I realized that I'm a lot closer to 'ok' than she is - not in a mean 'lolololol I'M BETTER THAN YOU ARE' adversarial sort of way, but in a sort of 'oh, ok, this gives me a much more accurate picture of my own situation' way.\n\nBut the most important thing I got from this was the words coming out of my mouth when I comforted her - I told her that even if she doesn't feel it inside in the deepest bits of her mind and heart and soul, that it's true that she's an awesome, kind, lovable, good person who is worthy of a guy who she desires (emotionally and physically) and who finds her desirable (emotionally and physically) and who loves her and makes the effort to spend time with her and is an actual DECENT person who treats her amazingly.\n\nAnd it struck me, afterward, that this is something I have needed to believe myself, and that this is 100% something that my friends think about me.",

I did not know what Narcissism was until about the last 6 months of my relationship. \n\nMy N EX would get physically violent in her rages, started off with a slap or two when I would actually put my foot down, engage in her antics and/or call her out on her BS. She left me a scar on my stomach that is about an inch long but very visible. Two days before I actually left her for good, she punched me twice, and caught me really good once giving me a black eye. I've subsequently suffered eye trauma from this and will be having a procedure to hopefully correct it, however it affects my peripheral vision on a daily basis. \n\nThis really hasnt set in until weeks later, but I'm so indescribably angry. I don't look in the mirror anymore to avoid seeing the scar, the blur I see to my left everyday is a constant reminder.

        "text": "To make a very, very long story short, I got out months ago and there's still a lot I'm working on.  But there's an ongoing situation that I'm only getting more uncomfortable about as it progresses, so I could use advice and support on it.\n\nEver since I moved into my latest apartment with my fiance, the landlord has had no idea I'm there.  Our roommate controls the lease and is subletting with the landlord's approval, which is legal and fine, but while he's seen me there a few times we've never made it clear that I actually live there.  Roomie has made it clear many times that he doesn't want the landlord to know, and after some initial miscommunications, Fiance and I became fine with this because we were exploring our options and didn't expect a shot at getting onto the lease ourselves.\n\nNow we stand a really great chance at actually getting on the lease in a few months when we have to renew, and it sounds like Roomie might move out.  Fiance is really excited to stay, but I'm worried about the cost and upset that it sounds like I would have to stay a secret.  I really want to tell the landlord that we're going to include me, even if that costs a little more, because we've also had some occasional emergencies and I don't want to have to call him and explain to him that I in fact live there mid-crisis.  But Fiance is afraid that if we do, he'll do a background check and discover that I've been living there for a year (by that time).  I'm not sure how this is worse than him discovering that months from now, when we're no longer putting up with Roomie's rules while we're subletting from him but actively being disingenuous ourselves.  Time is not a factor at least, and I don't know the specifics that're on the lease, so I'm hoping we can evaluate based on that later on.\n\nThe whole deal just has me really anxious and upset, and it feels like I don't really have any good choices.  The apartment needs a lot more upkeep than it's been getting, so there are workers in and out a lot lately.  This won't stay a secret forever; my very best case scenario is that the landlord is already aware, but I'm sure if he asks any questions then Roomie tells him I'm just visiting.  So if I out myself, I upset a balance I have very little information on, and if I stay quiet then I have my own conscience to contend with on top of the possible consequences.  I really don't want to be doing this and only put up with it this long because we had no choice at the time unless we wanted to not have somewhere to live.\n\nBear in mind Fiance is also a survivor of narcissistic abuse and is, I suspect, acting out of survival techniques that conflict with mine.  And Roomie also helped us out a lot in a pinch, so I don't blame him for this situation, I'm just really sick of being in it.\n\nSo, my question is, has anyone else been in a similar situation and what did you do?  Are there any potential heavy consequences after the fact (demanding backpaid rent, legal trouble)?  And, in this position what would you do?\n\nThanks in advance.",

As a result, I'm actually pretty oblivious to pain, and often don't even realize when I am sick.  It's weird.  I get pretty bad headaches, and I didn't take my first excedrin until I was 35 years old.\n\nAnyway, I've had this scratchy throat and stuffy nose that's been bugging me for a few days now.  Last night as I was laying in bed hacking and sniffling, I suddenly thought of those mucinex commercials (with that green mucus glob that goes around annoying everyone).  I didn't know what mucinex even does, but wondered if it could help with my nose/throat thing I had going on.\n\nSo, this morning I googled it, and it pretty much was supposed to help with my symptoms.  So, I went to the drug store, and felt strangely anxious and guilty for buying some mucinex.  I went home and took some and went about my day.  About an hour later, I noticed that I could breathe out of my nose again for the first time in a couple days.  The medicine worked.  It shouldn't have seemed weird to me, but it was.\n\nThe thing that really struck me about this is that it's how most \"normal\" people already live.  If something hurts, they can go to the drug store and find something to help ease the pain.  It didn't even occur to me that I could do this. This is a very basic life skill that I am only now learning at age 42.  It almost feels like cheating or something.\n\nAlso, there are so many things that we RBNs struggle with that most people don't even recognize.  All my co-workers and peers, they don't know that the life skill of getting some medicine when you get sick is something I don't quite grasp yet.  They don't even know this is a life skill because it's so inherent.  Some of the struggles we go through are so bizarre and hidden.  ",

She ended up seeing someone else straight away whilst I spent 7 weeks out of work at a relative's completely mentally and emotionally crippled. Did the silly thing and messaged constantly (she loved that knowing I was suffering) Got back on my feet and she appeared again wanting me back. Still vulnerable and wanting to be with my family I went back. Had the apologies, break downs, crying and what I saw as a cry from help from her (was \"diagnosed\" with BPD years ago)\n\nI asked for her to see her doctor, arrange councilling and get some help. This didn't happen and I was attacked if I  brought it up. \n\nThen after a couple of months the cracks started to show again. Complaining about my job, the money I earn and how I'm always at work. Im Working 6 days a week to make ends meet, she works two days a week and rest of her income &amp; flat is paid for. Rest of the time is spent with our son where she's developed a very controlling \"he is my property and mine alone\" attitude. Accusing me of things i didn't do and selecting certain things about me to use against me to get a reaction. Few weeks before she had hit me twice during an argument. All these acts are obvious attempts at bringing on emotional flashback. Saying things like \"this is why we split up before\" which immediately throws me back into thinking about past events I've had to deal with putting me in a vulnerable place mentally.\n\nI'm fully aware she is a Narcissist. And uses me for supply and others when needed. \n\nJust like to know any tips on how to cope with this. Been doing reasonably well up untill this point. Missing my son, who she still lets me see, but not being with my family is torture. Emotional flashbacks are running rampant past couple of days. Very aware of my codependency also so I'm a narcs dream!\n\nWould appreciate any methods of coping as im slipping back into old habits.\n\nCheers",

[A concise summary of repetition compulsion at Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anxiety-zen/201603/why-do-we-repeat-the-past-in-our-relationships).\n\nWhat am I 'repeating'?  The scenario whereby I feel compelled to do things to try to win over someone and get them to fall in love with and be interested in me, despite the fact that this is not going to happen.  I am doing this because my primary caregiver was a narcissist (or BPD with narcissist features), and people with NPD/BPD-with-narcissist-features do not love.  So my own attempts at showing love to my primary caregiver were unrequited, and this is the pattern that has historically played out in my dating life.\n\nI think perhaps my issues with telling whether men are attracted to me are colored by the fact that the set of men attracted to me and the set of men I am attracted to has overlapped exactly once, and only briefly.  It has nothing to do with how good-looking I am, either; sure, that's a vital and necessary component of attraction, but I know many men who are conventionally EXTREMELY GOOD-LOOKING who I'm not attracted to.  Consequently I have absolutely no experience with what it looks and feels like to have my attraction returned (because the one time it overlapped, well, eh, things didn't work out in the normal fashion).\n\nI have these thoughts about the matter:\n\n*The Price of Admission* talks about the fact that healthy relationships do not have a price of admission; that you are loved for who you are, and that connection and love in healthy relationships do not come at a price.  People who were raised by good-enough parents are taught this their entire lives - that (in contrast to the way we were abused and misled as children) to be loved, you do not have to pay the price of:\n\n* not having boundaries\n* feeling you don't have a right to having boundaries\n* enduring physical and emotional abuse\n* being disloyal to yourself\n* non-mutuality (in the case of romantic relationships, non-mutuality includes a lack of reciprocation of physical attraction)\n* silencing yourself\n* sacrificing your goals and dreams and needs\n* having to act and look and seem perfect all the time\n* walking on eggshells\n* neglecting your feelings and needs in favor of the other person's\n\nThe people who want to connect with you aren't the adults who raised you.  Healthy people want mutuality; your opinions, your feelings, your integrity.  When you treat them like they want to silence, exploit, or punish you, the mirror you hold up to them by your continuing insistence on paying prices they didn't and don't want to ask for reflects someone they have no desire to be, with you or anyone else.  The absence of healthy boundaries is unattractive and off-putting to healthy people; healthy people want you to have a self, and that's the self that you quickly put away as soon as the relationship started to mean something; as soon as they mattered to you, you tried to pay a price for your connection, and they didn't want you to do that.\n\nI also feel a bit caught in a catch-22.  I realize that I shouldn't be in a relationship with a man I'm not physically attracted to - it's not fair to me, it's not fair to him.  No matter how good our friendship is, and already I dimly suspect two men I'm friends with, including one I'm quite good friends with, are attracted to me, and I'm not attracted back.  I'm not giving into the sad sense of resignation of 'take what I can get because I can't get what I want' again, and the men I've slept with/dated previously - none of them were right for me, ultimately.  At the same time, the men I'm attracted to don't seem to be attracted back.  I have decided that what this means is that \n\n1) I need to cut off my parents permanently ASAP (however, I am extraordinarily angered by the idea that the right guy may not be there for me as I cut my parents off permanently - what kind of asshole isn't there to support someone he's in love with or will eventually be in love with when they go through a hard time?)\n\n2) I need to not chase this guy I've had The Most Intense Crush Of My Life on and make peace with the probability that I'm never going to find the right guy - and ironically as soon as I do that, the right guy might reveal himself.\n\nEDIT:  This was also helpful:  https://byrslf.co/am-i-undateable-and-other-fears-834abe16a4d6\n\nEDIT:  As if that wasn’t enough, I basically clam the hell up around men I’m attracted to, and I get feelings of being inferior and awkward and not ‘cool’ enough for them.  I’m pushing thirty, what the fuck.",

I can't believe the person he ended up being.\n\nThe day he broke up with me he pretended like everything was fine and even kissed me when I picked him up. The night before he had even posted all the pictures up from our relationship and asked me how I felt about them. He comes to my house the next day and he pretended to share a drink with me pretending like everything is normal.\n\nWhat happened next shook me. He brought up the need for us to break up and insulted me. There was no emotion or remorse on his face and he didn't seem to care that he was hurting me. He said I wasn't intellectual enough and boring (things he had never said about me before. In fact, he had said how smart and exciting I was). He said he only saw me \"as a friend\" after months of dating. I feel like I was conned. No boyfriend has ever insulted me and had no care for what he was doing. On top of which, he left me this card. ---&gt; https://imgur.com/a/CABm3\n\nAfter all was said and done I asked him to leave the drink and to leave my house. He refused and chugged it in front of me. I can't believe I had been with someone who pretended to be this kind and loving person only to disrespect me. I had been nothing but supportive and kind.",

I've done little jobs, but only for extended family —jobs where I'd be helping them with things they don't know how to, or that can't affort to pay an actual person for, so jobs I have learnt nothing from. But I've never actually had a job.\n\nI don't have a driver's license, and nobody will help me with getting it. That's my actual aim, but I can't bring myself to. It costs a big deal of money in my country, and I can't ponder if it's worth it in my actual state, as I have no one to talk this with.\n\nMy friends are distant and emotionally absent. They've always been. They know I've been in this hard place since forever, and have always been ok with it. They can't make a difference. Lately I've been asking more openly for help, and it's been made clear to me nobody will move a finger for me. Not that I blame them, but they have all been helped by different persons in their lives. I've never had any feedback. Negative feedback would be positive for me, but not even that I can get.\n\nI just don't know anymore. I don't think I can do. Everyone keeps telling me, as they've done all my life, than I'm ok, when I am not. This is infuriating, and if I face them with my reality, they tell me I'm being self-defeating. \n\nI've never been anywhere, never worked, never had a relationship at my age. I'm not having self-esteem issues; if anything, I perceive my esteem too precisely.\n\nI don't know how to do anything. You know when someone takes you and teaches you how to do something, and it goes ok because they're experienced? I've never experienced that in my life, ever. I've always been, instead, that kind of person, but only for people who have been in a worse shape than me. In school, teachers used me to teach the problematic kids; in university, I was never a problem, and people relied on me; in the little jobs I've had, I've been helping adults to get actualised, or just have been doing for them things they don't know how to, being paid less than people get paid for watching babies. There's never been anything or anyone in my life that has made a difference for me.\n\nEvery day I wake up, and I have an entire day, but I just have no plan. There's no one willing to help me make one that makes sense. I am unfit for making plans for myself, because I don't have any experience in life.\n\nI'm considering commiting myself in some institution. I'd make things up, if I had to; I don't care. I just want someone to care for me for once in my life. Otherwise, I don't think I deserve to live. Not in the sense that it sounds: it's not like I believe I deserve to die, but I can't find a reason for pushing for a life. I'm rather ok the way I am. Everyone I've met has been ok with me being the way I am. I've always been this way, I don't know any other way, so I don't know if it's worth it. You can't crave something you've never experienced.\n\nI always believed I had some friends in some people, and it's been heartbreaking seeing that I've actually always been alone. That's a devastating thought, to me. And it's not as if I'm not likeable, I believe people enjoy my company —or so I've been told—, but it's as if I live in a parallel universe where I don't get anyone ever caring for me.",

I have moved on from (most but not all) of the abusers from my family of origin and have a strong marriage, secure attachments with my two young kids, good relations with my in laws, and many positive interactions with neighbors and acquaintances in my community. But there is an area of my life where something is still missing and that’s close friendships with other mom friends.  I’m not exactly sure why this is. Things start off on the right foot, our kids are the same age and play well together, we share some common interests, live near each other, and there’s an even give and take in the conversation flow at first. Something changes though and I find these new budding friendships last a few weeks, a year at best. Two out of my four mom friends have moved away. The other two have given hints that they may move at some point in the future too. This is very discouraging! It’s usually only a few weeks or months that get togethers with these moms last. They start to become flakey with play dates. Maybe they were just on “good behavior” at first but then got more comfortable showing their real self or maybe just busy with everything else going on on life? I don’t know. I know it might not be personal but what if it is? My son loves his friends and it just hurts so bad to see him miss out because his friend’s mom and I don’t get on. He asks to see these friends every day! I’m not even sure if I’m the reason they are stand offish but I’m rejection sensitive because of past bullying. I always assume the problem is me. My son is doing fantastic in preschool and has friends there but I’d like for him to have the neighborhood friends that he’ll grow up with and develop life long bonds. Plus, it would be wonderful to have families our whole family can bond with. That’s something my family of origin did not have: friends! I so badly want things to go differently for ours.

Emotional invalidation and neglect, identified as the problem child, etc.  I could go into specific detail but that is more of what r/RaisedByNarcissists is for.\n\nHow much blame should I carry for how I was raised?  I know it is an odd question, but I do feel like if only I had figured out how to be a better person I wouldn’t have been punished as much as a child.  Now I’m in my early 30s and it feels like I’ve failed at life completely.  I don’t have a job I like, I failed at getting the career I wanted.  Life is just generally miserable.  I’m LC with both nparents.  \n\nHow do you end up growing past your childhood?  It really hurts when I realize My future was irrecoverably negatively impacted because of it.  On one hand it seems like self-blame is something nparents would want from their targets.  Also, I hate the victim culture/mindset and want out of it.  I really don’t know how to do it though.\n\nEdit:  Thanks for all the responses.  They were great and very insightful.",

        "text": "So, I lucked the hell out and despite my first 18-odd years, I have a great life now. Happy family of my own, decent job, good friends, nice place to live and all that. I’ve been NC with Nparent and enablers for years now and have mostly been left alone. Friends and family have even come out of the woodwork and been supportive after seeing the N’s behavior after I left. I sometimes feel like the luckiest person in the world. Growing up the way I did, being treated like some kind of monster when I was just a normal kid, I never really saw a future for myself. The life I have now isn’t perfect but it’s still better than I could have dreamed.\n\nHowever, I still find myself struggling to enjoy life. I think this is partly because when I was growing up, anything I enjoyed or was interested in was held over my head as a threat. Most things I loved were taken away at some point or another. \n\nI also find that I have pretty constant, low-level anxiety about losing everything. It’s hard to dismiss because honestly, life is precarious and things really can unravel for just about anyone. I’m proactive about most things but anything’s possible. I’m sure the abuse has something to do with this - constantly having it drilled into my head what a failure I was, how I would never amount to anything,  I’m sure you guys can relate. Plus I struggled in most areas of my life due to trauma and health issues right after I escaped the Nhome. I still have a very hard time feeling secure. I’m struggling to convince myself that hey, even if the worst happened and I lost my job or something, I’m a skilled professional and can get another, and things like that. \n\nTl;dr: due to past abuse I struggle with feeling secure, and don’t feel secure enough to enjoy life as much as I should. \n\nAnyone else experienced this? How did you overcome it?",

As long as we are on the subject, my brother was also making me going to sleep a horrific experience with his loud laptop sound. I told him last week to stop it and looks like he has.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/84ut71/how_i_went_nc_with_nsister/",
        "text": "Grab a drink and settle in, this may be long. I'm NC with NSister for 9 years at this point.\n\nI hinted the other day about having an Nsister (NS) who has a long history of being even worse than my Nfather (she learned from the master.) During the early 80s, she was amazingly great and mellow because she was on Prozac (I highly recommend this for ALL N's.) She was agreeable, not controlling, had empathy... it was wonderful. I truly enjoyed being around her then. \n\nWell, that dream ended when she decided she didn't need it any longer. Medical literature may or may not back me up on this, but in my experience, when people quit Prozac cold turkey, it can unleash the monster within. She became worse than before the Prozac. There are many things that happened after this point in our relationship including huge lies which she got others to believe about me (gaslighting in the extreme), multiple thefts wherein she would later lie and try to prove how the items were never mine to begin with - or - say she didn't have them (only to be found with them later) and other dramatic over-the-top scenes and incidents that were pretty damaging.\n\nIn order to keep myself sane, I kept my distance. I'd been in a couple long-term same-sex relationships, (my current one is 23 years and going strong). However, she's very homophobic, so that triggers a lot of stuff for me. But she was covert about it, nice to my face, dissing me behind my back to our family, very typical. I would limit contact down to maybe twice a year and holidays. Driving any distance with her was a big NO, I had done it once and it was a nightmare, so never again on that. She has a lovely way of using little nicknames to demean me, instead of my actual name. \"Pumpkin\" was a favorite. At the time I was 49 years old, so being a full-grown man and getting called \"Pumpkin\" in public was pretty aggravating. Another favorite trick was showing up an hour late for ANYTHING, entering the room talking loudly and then pretty much monopolizing the conversation after that point, all about her, no questions or interest in anyone else. My partner hated her almost instantly. He's sort of a loner anyway and isn't that big on dramatic women, so it was hell trying to get him to any family event because of her.\n\nThere's this policy I have with people in general (and N people always), I give them three strikes and then they're out. I figure if you've messed with me at a big level and been told about it at least twice, you should know not to fuck with me the third time. At this point in our relationship (and this was after one of the thefts and two big lies) I literally BEGGED her to talk to me about our relationship because I felt like it was hanging by a thread. Her response was: \"I have no idea what you're talking about, I think we're just fine\".  \n\nAllrighty then.\n\nSo, fast forward to the when her daughter (a carbon copy of NS but worse, if you can believe it) is getting married a year from that point. Keep in mind, I have had no contact or even seen the daughter in 6 years. She'd grown up, moved out, gone to college, etc. She'd opted not to see me the last few holidays while she was living at home, so I didn't really know her at all. Last time I'd seen her she was 16 and basically gave me a sullen \"I hate you\" look and nothing more. Nice, eh?\n\nMy NS decides she wants to help Ndaughter with planning the wedding and of course, my being gay, I know all about weddings, right? Uhm, no. I have never planned one, don't know the first thing about them and really am not interested. But that doesn't stop NS from calling and asking decor advice and so on, because that's the only way NS can see me, as the cliché. About the third conversation where she's calling and asking for tips, she asks what I'm wearing to the wedding. \n\nAnd here comes the truth bomb. \n\nI tell her that I didn't really know Ndaughter any longer, hadn't seen her in 6 years and have never met the fiance, so I wasn't planning on going to the wedding. This is met with silence for a full 8 seconds and then \"Oh, Ok, fine. Well I have to go, talk to you later.\"  She was coming to my house a few days later for one of those rare visits, so I was sort of nervous and expectant as to what might ensue. \n\nShe shows up to the house, typically loud and all about her and then walks up to my SO and says \"Hi, I guess (my name) isn't going to the wedding, but screw him, you can come without him and we'll have a great time, OK?\"  Sure, like my SO is going to go by himself to an event where she's present. This was meant to trigger me into a drama-scene but I just bit my tongue and we carried on thru the night and she left after dinner. It was exhausting as usual, the night was all about her wants and needs. \n\nIn an effort to try and calm things down and explain myself, I thought I might email her and tell her what the deal was, why I didn't feel comfortable going. After all, her Ndaughter had never treated me with anything but contempt, but NS was apparently oblivious to this fact. \n\nI wrote and explained that I didn't really know Ndaughter any longer, didn't feel any strong pull to go to this wedding and had no real relationship with her. I'd simply be a relative standing there to help make Ndaughter's side of the aisle look more full. (I had heard through the grapevine later that my Nfather was the ONLY relative on her side of the aisle which was pretty empty.) I also said that from my viewpoint, Ndaughter really didn't like me much, only had mean things to say to me and never really treated me with much more than contempt when I was around her - 6 years ago! I certainly didn't want Ndaughter to feel uncomfortable with my being there and that Ndaughter had not invited me, only Nsister had. I wrote that I now didn't really feel any emotions toward her daughter either way, I didn't hate her but I also didn't like or love her, basically no feelings at all because I DON'T KNOW HER AT ALL. (Caps here are for emphasis, I didn't actually write it this way at that point.) Email seemed safe, non-confrontational and a way to have a dialogue about this. I thought.\n\nBut I decided to also throw out an olive branch. Ndaughter worked in the same small town where I lived. She had an hour for lunch. I wrote that I would gladly host her for some lunches over the next year and perhaps she and I could get to know each other again. She was an adult at that point, maybe she was different, maybe without NS around, we could develop some rapport. I was willing to give that a shot. Free lunch with her uncle and perhaps a nice relationship would develop. Hey, I'm a nice guy, I cook good stuff... why not? Then I'd feel a lot better about coming to the wedding since I'd then *really* know her and want to come to her and her spouse's special day. Seemed like a no-brainer to me, she drives a minute to my house, we have lunch, she goes back to work. We'd have a year to get this accomplished. \n\nWell, this was met with silence. **For the next 6 months.** Absolutely nothing back from Nsister, which I thought was really disrespectful and rude, but there you have it. Then, one day out of the blue she calls and leaves a message. \"Did I have her scrabble game?\" Well, we'd never played scrabble at my house and she knows it, but I figure she's sticking a toe in the water to see what the temperature was. I emailed her back: 6 months of silence after my writing a very difficult and careful email that was trying to foster a dialogue about a relationship with her daughter, and now she only wants to know the whereabouts of a game? That's it? No, I don't have her game. End of email.\n\nThen I get a torrent of wild stuff back, a very long email. According to her I'm a terrible person, I lie about everything, I'm a coward because I wrote instead of calling about this, my email was cruel to her and to her family, I needed to have people jump through hoops in order to be in my life, and on and on. It ended with her saying that she and her family were a package deal and that she was kind enough to be around my SO with no problems and didn't expect us to jump through hoops. She decided to forgive me for my sins and had moved on and didn't write back because she knew I'd only play the victim. \n\nSome facts:\n\nFor the last 8 years in our relationship, we had NEVER been invited to her house. Not once. I always invited her and her family to ours and she always came alone, no husband, no kids. Even for holidays. So, the package deal thing was not, uh, quite accurate. And the \"hoops\" business... wow. I guess having the Ndaughter drive the full 2 minutes to my house and get a free lunch while getting to know her Uncle was some pretty cruel hoops for her. Shame on me! \n\nThat was strike 3.  I was done. I went full NC and have not had anything to do with her since. A weight has definitely been lifted and as well, I don't have to worry about my belongings being stolen or any more giant lies being told about me to the rest of the family.\n\nTLDR: Nsister has a coniption fit because I'm not going to her daughter's wedding. This results in NC.\n",

(I was 100% fine with the casual nature of our relationship, but wasn't interested in being any kind of destabilizing force on the side) He was extremely understanding when I brought this up, which actually makes me more uneasy because I'm always geared up for a fight and for someone to lash out at me whenever I voice my feelings, especially in awkward situations like these. I know a certain level of \"rejection\" is natural to feel after this, but it's pushing the ACoN buttons of my dad abandoning me and my brother for my ex stepmom and her kids much more than this actual situation calls for. Sure, it wasn't the best way to find out, but it strikes me as a garden variety unthinking mishap rather than the pathology I'm accustomed to receiving from my dad. That realization isn't completely preventing me from sending myself down the rabbit hole of \"you weren't worth keeping around even on this limited level and people will keep doing this to you because your dad was right about disposing of you and they know that\" as irrational as I know that all is, and it can paralyze me for days on end.

        "text": "So, in a post I made in RBN I spoke about my mother, what she did to me and how cruel she was whilst iI was growing up and how I came to realize that she was a horrible narcissistic bitch who only wanted me for the money I could get her from the government. \n\nWell, I thought here would be an appropriate place to post this. If not, my mistake, you let me know and I'll fix it. Also if this get's a bit too long there is a TL;DR at the bottom of my post.\n\nIt's been almost 4 years this year since I last saw and spoke to mother. In this time I feel like I have gone through the seven stages of bereavement. It has been so hard getting to where I am but I am proud of the progress I have made. I am healthier, free, happier than I have ever been before and thanks to the amazing people of Reddit, I have realized that I am not alone. \n\nMy family have found me, my wonderful Nan and my Aunts and Uncles and most importantly of all, I found my father. \n\nIn my last post about mother on RBN I called him basically a deadbeat, a baby killer, he hated me, he never wanted me and he still would want nothing to do with me today.\nWell I found out it was all one big lie. \n\nMy father has been looking for me for ages and that his reason for leaving was because he feared that I would be taken away forever, brain washed and he would be accused of abuse. So he left at an age where he thought I would not remember. But he was wrong. \n\nHe and my Nan set me straight (once again) and now I feel like an idiot for getting caught up in her lies. \n\nI never thought I would ever get back in contact with my dad. I never thought he would care about me. \n\nI also can't believe that there are still lies that I am uncovering! It's like I am learning how to live all over again.\n\nI still can't believe I found my father and he wanted me and he still wants a relationship with me and how I have siblings that are going to be nice and not hate me because the twisted sicko has gotten into their heads! It's going to be amazing! I am so glad I have the truth and that all my doubts have been cleared up. I really feel like I got the closure I needed when talking to my dad. Now, I can move forward, confident in myself and (hopefully) never have to think about her again!!\n\nShe is the toxic block that people do not need in their lives, I am ashamed to call her my mother and it is a shame that she still holds the capacity to potentially breed more souls into her child-slave-labor-camp that she calls home. I have never hated any one more in my life. But I guess it's time to let go of all of that negative energy and hatred and forget about her. I have good people in my life now and she has no more room in my mind.\n\nTL;DR\nAfter being no contact with my mother for almost 4 years all my family has finally come back to me and I really feel like I can move forward now",

        "text": "I'm an adult man in his mid-20s now.  Growing up, my dad beat me and my mom up.  He made death threats towards me and my mother.  He constantly told me I was weak, unintelligent, worthless, etc.  I then became friends with someone in college who was very manipulative and further lowered my self-esteem.  Anyway, I fortunately ended that friendship and cut off from my dad.  \n\nOne thing that still bothers me a lot is feelings of powerlessness.  I think what bothers me most is the fear of my dad hurting me that was ingrained in me as a child.  Both that he could physically and emotionally hurt me, and I felt powerless against that.  \n\nPhysically, I was smaller than him.  We're roughly the same size now, but I'm still not sure who would win in a fight.  I do work out.  I'm not really planning to do martial arts due to some medical issues that make injuries risky.  Now, even though I've cut contact and don't plan on getting into a physical altercation with him, what drives me nuts is the fear that floods my mind when I picture his angry face (growing up, this face was basically the telltale sign that violence would be ensuing shortly, and it terrified me then, so it pisses me off that it still terrifies me and makes me feel like a helpless child again).\n\nEmotionally, what I hate is that when I look back at \"conversations\" from the past, I feel like no matter what I said, he knew just the right things to say to hit on all my insecurities, to make me feel like a failure.  I go through these conversations in my head sometimes wondering what the perfect response would have been.  Truthfully, there is none.  But it still pisses me off that even now I would feel so unable to come up with anything to say that would shut him down, and instead he was always able to say something to make me feel awful.\n\nAlso, yes, I have gone to therapy (a few mediocre/decent therapists, actually).  I've found that people on this sub have a much better understanding of what I've gone through and often better insights, so I thought I would ask here.",

The divorce is nearly final, my nex has moved on to his new supply, but two of our three kids go back and forth. Those two do not realize that their previous life was abusive- in fact, they don't even remember it that well (they are now 11 &amp; 13 and things started falling apart nearly 3 years ago) and were kinda GCs even then. They are starting to realize the differences between their parents' houses and that they feel less comfortable with him despite him there being more structure at his house. They feel they can \"be themselves\" at my house, for instance. The kids are all in therapy and I encourage them to discuss the uncomfortable feelings with their therapists- they can talk with me but I want them to have a \"neutral party\" to talk with (who can also verify their feelings if needed).\n\nI realize now how I enabled my nex's behavior and even pushed it onto our children myself. I'm still struggling with aspects of parenting, though therapy has been very helpful. \n\nI am not an ACON- I'm probably the grandchild of one, but the generation in between seems to \"merely\" have some deeply ingrained FLEAS. (Likes control and brags but respects their spouse's autonomy when reminded to and does seem to empathize.) So RBN would seem to be out. \n\nI'm away from my nex and we rarely communicate, sticking to sheer logistical requests dealing with the children. I am dealing with my abuse as I can (with my therapist) and am mostly focused on re-entering the world and healing/preventing further damage to my kids right now. I'm not sure NarcissisticAbuse would apply even if they didn't have a sticky post about how they wouldn't accept Narc Parent posts.\n\nAnd RBNSpouses is for the spouses of people who were RBN- which I could have posted in before it all blew up and my nex let his narc flag fly, but not now- they're not for former spouses of narcs.\n\nWhere can a former spouse of a narc go for support in parenting kids that still have to cope with the narc? Which subreddit does my situation best fit?  Thank you for any help you can give me!",

As I became a teenager, and even up into my early 20s, I started constantly comparing myself to others and tried to achieve the \"ideal\" according to my father.  I even started viewing everyone in terms of how my father would.  This led to essentially classifying people as \"winners\" and \"losers\" (based on my dad's definition).  \n\nThis affected my interactions with people.  This affected not only the way I looked at others but much more importantly at myself.  Every day would be a quest to try and convince myself I'm better than the \"losers\" and more like the \"winners.\"  A quest to become a winner.  A quest to become someone I could accept.  A quest to become worthy of approval.  It was a journey that created lots of hatred.  This worked against me in so many ways.  It took a while, after the realization, to change my thinking patterns.  \n\nMy advice would be:\n\n1. Identify these distortions\n\n2. Challenge these distortions\n\n3. Cut off toxic people (including toxic \"friends\")\n\n4. Befriend \"healthy\", positive thinkers so their thinking rubs off on you\n\n5. Start seeing the good in everyone (this doesn't mean tolerating disrespect and abuse)\n\n6. Realize that everyone, including you, is worthy exactly as you are (if you want to improve some parts of your life, by all means, but what you look like, your grades, etc. don't have anything to do with your value and worth as a human being).",

In the middle of all this, a long time friend called for support... she comes from a narcissistic family and her mother was in the hospital for some kind of painkiller addiction. Friend's N/E brother and mother's latest squeeze (she's already had for husbands and this looks like a con man aiming to be number 5) lives with mum and use her money freely while encouraging her addiction /indulging their own... apparently mum's fiancé is a Freemason as well as a drug dealer. \n\n\nAnyway despite everything I had going on I thought it was important to be a good friend and be as supportive as I could manage while handling my own things, so I advised my friend to call adult protective services and let them investigate.\n\n\nAt this point I think I should mention my friend has a bit of a logical thinking blind spot. She believes that Wi-Fi gives me headaches and she is reluctant to engage with therapy in a way that challenges her, instead she's recently build out on a therapist for the third time I think and had been doing things like drumming therapy, while complaining the entire time that the rest of the group or libtards comma and then trying some sort of crystal and Tibetan singing bowl therapy, which was tremendous the expensive and really wasn't getting her anywhere so then she went back to the therapists who agrees with her politics but challenges her so she stopped seeing the therapist again so anyway that's like the third time that she's gone away from actual medicine into these alternative things. I should also mention that she used to have a shopping Addiction and we stopped being friends in 2004 when we were both on active duty because my mum had given her money for us both to go for a final spa day before I left for Iraq again and she spent it on shoes for herself. Anyway about 2014 I got a letter from her that she was trying to do the steps to overcome her shopping Addiction and she apologised and wanted to reconcile and it actually went pretty well and I was quite proud of her managing her shopping addiction. But I think this is part of why she's so incredibly triggered about her mum switching from booze to drugs, I think it's bringing up a lot of unresolved addiction issues that she has and she feels threatened. I'm not a therapist but just so you know the background and now in her for so long that's my guess. Meanwhile her husband puts up with all this s*** frankly I think he's a saint.\n\nAnyway so Mum took herself out of the hospital and goes back to the little Drug Den that is now home to Mum the possibly narcissist but definitely enabling brother who is also having addiction issues and this freemason fiance who's snuffling his own products. It turns out the mum checked herself out against doctor's orders because she has some kind of dirty needle wound that's got infected so badly they had to take tissue out of her buttocks all the way down to the Bone. So my friend is already freaking out about how are they going to get to the neighbouring state where mum lives and stage an Intervention and I said hey back the bus up call adult protective services you have your own issues you need to look after and so she agreed to this and called them\n\n\nSo because there's three people involved adult protective services is having to take a little longer than usual with the investigation and my friend decides to give free play to all her issues and fantastical or magical thinking.\n In the meanwhile she becomes convinced the freemasons are satanists and starts messaging me at inappropriate times comma I'm in a different time zone so this would be like Midnight in my time zone, with remarks about how it's this  boyfriend/fiance's faults that her mum is addicted and why is freemasonry even allowed because it's satanism, and her brother somehow plays no part in this I don't quite remember why but she Focuses on the new boyfriend or fiance as the bad guy and the brother is more of an accomplice and taking Mum for every penny that she's got left, which from the things that my friend was saying about what happened at the hospital it sounds like Mum is pretty close to terminally addicted anyway and from the living conditions that it's filthy, so I'm kind of doubtful there's any money or anything material to be gotten except selling off stuff and sticking it in there needles.\n\n I didn't feel like dealing with this at midnight anyway so at that point I said look I need you to text me during appropriate hours for my time zone because I have a ton of issues going on that are already affecting my sleep and I can't afford to lose any sleep because disabilites, pain, etc but I still want to be supportive so feel free to text but could you keep it to particular hours \n\n\nand here's a book I'll get you that you can read through called codependent no more.... which may be familiar to a few of us here, anyway there is a new Edition and my friends husband is a bit younger than us so I thought the updated edition would be helpful for him because he's learning about narcissism and his trying to break contact with members of his family as well. \n\n\nSo I thought this could be a support since she has no service, and because of the time difference is, and because her husband is still learning to cope with all this and suddenly there's a crisis comma  meanwhile I'm still trying to deal with  the ever more crap being added to the absolute crap fest of life events going on. And she's not really willing to sit and let me vent, she's helping me with questions and ideas in this rather fantastical conspiracy thinking and I can deal with that kind of stuff on a good day let alone in the middle of all my own life stuff going on which it's a really extensive list but involves the house flooding and malaria and chronic medical issues and being hit by a car and some other stuff. \n\n\nSo she gets the book and she says oh it came in a beautiful bag from Amazon and she and her husband are looking forward to reading it and she's really stressed out because she hasn't heard from adult protective services and it's already Friday and I'm like well there's a three people and they have to investigate each person safety as well as the overall situation of what's going on in and it's difficult when people are in full blown Addiction and it's difficult because there's not that many social workers in that area but they're actively investigating she went straight to the top of the list so hang tight in and just let adult protective services do the thing and you know tried to just find some other things to occupy your mind because you're doing the obsessive thinking thing again so she says ok she's going to go read the book then and will I call tomorrow\n\n\nThen I get a midnight text about oh my god she just found something online the freemasons are totally satanists and why is this even allowed and I replied hey I already said this is midnight in my timezone and you've just woken me up. I have relatives who are Masons it is not satanism please stop reading conspiracy websites and I'll talk to you in the morning period at which point I get another text saying why can't I be supportive and why am I disrespecting her bye discouraging her from looking into the freemasons and satanism. So I texted her back and I said look it is after midnight here this is not an appropriate time for this discussion I've just set a boundary and you've ignored it I've also asked you before two believe what you want about Mason's but there are people in my family who are Masons and they are not satanists and I do not appreciate you calling them that and this is the second or third time that you've done this so I will talk to you in the morning if you want to speak in the morning. \n\n\nAt which point I get a third text saying,  I'm not reading anymore about codependency it's complete b******* how dare you label my husband and I are codependent you're not a psychologist, you can't deny the Mason's are satanists and I feel sorry for you that you're related to them and I'm sorry if you feel disrespected but....\n\n\nand at that point I thought NOPE and deleted it \n\n\nIt's long past Monday and I haven't heard from her comma I think I am forced appropriate boundaries so I really don't feel the need to call her and deal with her issues since she's taking that attitude. I understand the Mechanics of breathe but I think she went way over the personal boundaries and I'm not putting up with it. I have a lot of my own stuff to deal with and even if I didn't I still wouldn't put up with somebody raging at me like that on text deliberately bringing up or doing things that I've said hey here's a boundary\n\n\n\nBut I just wanted to check in with you guys if you think I'm overreacting because of the purchase of my own situation or if you think I've given her a fair chance and she's blown it. I'm already relaxing two deal with her magical thinking issues on top of the disrespect and I think she's not resolved her own addiction issues as much as she thinks she's has by getting all round up in this and that she's not committed to breaking the PVR triangle by letting adult protective services to its job she's not really functional and most importantly not really is safe for a trustworthy person anymore or at least not at this point.\n\n\nSo I'm just wondering what you guys think because I thought those were pretty simple and straightforward boundaries that I stated clearly and I was helping as best I could but if that's how she's behaving then it's just better to not be involved anymore. And I hate to say it but I really don't want to be her friend anymore if that's how she treats people who she's asked for help.\n\n\nSo anyway please let me know, it's kind of sad but I've got the feeling like we've just grown up differently and I need to be moving along and dealing with my stuff and sticking with my friends who are supportive and who asked for my support without overwhelming me period but my econ brain is saying well maybe let her come down and give her another chance but the part of me that's been the therapy is like no I I don't think there's more chances there's already been a lot of forgiveness and a lot of healthy interaction but it's become increasingly unhealthy and she's not focusing on wellness she's focusing on drama and I feel badly about leaving her husband and deal with her by themselves but it's really up to him if he wants to stay in that situation all I can say is that I really don't feel like being friends with someone who behaves that way and isn't at least trying to maintain their progress but actively criticising people that she's asked for help like the Drum group in the therapists and now me so then I feel stupid like I should have seen that one coming.\n\n\nAnyways sorry this is going on for a bit but I'm interested to know what you all think and thanks from tartan\n\n\nPlease excuse my mistakes comma the talk to text software for the disabled on my phone is having issues and I've been working on it but another relatives as pointed out it's making some of the same mistakes again and I'm awfully tired tonight so I probably didn't catch things reading this over and I'm not even sure it makes sense because I'm so tired but anyway I'll stop pre apologising because that safely obviously I just need to sign out and get some sleep in check back in the morning what you guys advise.

        "text": "My grandmother is a flying monkey for my Ndad. I've been nc with him for years, but she just can't accept it. We used to be close, but since I cut him out she has this cycle of gradually mentioning him to me, then more and more, then she'll engineer a \"chance\" encounter, then \"ask my permission\" for a more overt one (which she'll sometimes do at the last minute or otherwise raise the stakes so I feel pressure to say yes, like bringing it up in front of my son or other people I don't want to get into it with). The escalation continues until I give her a big enough response that shuts it down, like shouting or cutting her off...then she goes into wounded animal mode with \"I just don't understand this! I was just trying to help! I don't understand why you're mad at me! I don't understand why you're mad at him!\". \n\nThe first few times I was fooled into thinking, wow maybe I somehow wasn't clear about what I want/didn't like/won't put up with, I'll explain it again. But I'm sure we all know how that goes- give them anything and they'll turn it inside out. Any objection I have she'll explain away, protest or confrontation she'll be hurt by, explanation she'll discount. Or, at some point in the cycle she'll pretend to understand, and go back to an earlier point- mention him less for a little while, put off the next ambush- but it's always still coming. That's what I mean by \"big enough response\"- I can always tell when I've delayed the cycle as opposed to restarting it. \n\nI'm just sick of the mess. Every time I have to figure out how to handle her it takes days of my energy and attention, and leaves me feeling bad about myself bc I was somewhere on the scale of \"swept my feelings under the rug\" and \"was mean to an old lady\". \n\nClaiming to \"not understand!\" over and over again is gaslighting. It's throwing all the history and tears and explanations and strife out the window, and acting like now you have a clean slate. It's an attempt to excuse your latest actions, because they exist in a vacuum and essentially it's the \"first time\" because you \"just don't understand!\" what it's all related to. And once she takes that position, I'm mean and I'm crazy for \"dredging up the past\" to explain my perspective, which is simply that time is actually continuous for me and this is not the first but the Umpteenth time. Which is actually sane and i resent it being characterized as crazy. \n\nI just wanted to advocate/complain about this today, because I think often gaslighting is seen as a bigger event, a major conspiracy or big move. I'm realizing it can be as simple as \"I just don't understand!\", which will make any compassionate person invested in the relationship feel pulled to try again. Which is how they get ya. \n\nAnd it truly sucks to feel like you have to subvert your own humanity to survive around these people. I don't want to have to ignore my grammy. I don't want to refuse her an explanation when she asks for one. But it hurts me to get sucked into a discussion about how I'm just so hard to understand because I know I'm not. Hurts to offer an explanation and then slowly over weeks or months have her \"understanding\" slowly morph into actions that are the opposite of understanding. \n\nSorry, guys. Feeling sorry for myself today. Thanks for listening. ❤",

        "text": "I am 35 male and I grew up in an extremely narcissistic family to the point where I ran away from home one night in 2008 after my father tried to stab me with a knife. I had to find my way around in the world because I had absolutely zero life skills when I moved out from New York to Houston. Ever since then, I lived in multiple states working odd jobs. Finally I got a break when I was able to secure a “computer science” related job in 2012.\n\n\nBut don’t get me wrong. That didn’t fix everything. My life has been a roller coaster ever since I can remember. I used to drink and smoke and was even addicted to pornography for a while. During this time, my father died and as a result, I moved back in with my mother and brother because I was in between jobs at the time. My mother is a covert narcissist and my brother is a narcissist himself just like my father. He threatened to stab me with a knife one day because they didn’t understand the growth I went through in their absence. My mother wants to baby me and controls me and manipulates me with every walking breath from her lungs.\n\n\nSince I started living with them, I have had a good paying job , but because of issues at work and me not knowing how to deal with it in a mature way, I quit and did some real estate investing. Unfortunately, that didn’t go well and I got sued by a credit card company. It’s all paid off and currently I am doing some freelance job , which doesn’t pay much, but I get to put that on my resume as presently working since I think that sounds better than saying “unemployed”.  I have had 4-5 interviews so far with no luck.\n\n\nI want to get a job and move out , but I am finding it hard where I should move to . Most of my extended family live in New York, but recently they have started moving else where. New York only brings me bad memories unfortunately, but at the same time it has tons of opportunities. \nI have experience living in Texas and Florida. But I can’t make up my mind on where I should move to or what kind of a company I want to work for even. I have no beef with my mom/brother and don’t want to cut off completely, but I want to move to a place where I can start my own life separate from them and their constant abuse. But why am I having a hard time deciding where I should move to next ? I know that narcissistic families destroys the victims power of self and the power to make decisions on their own- but I don’t know how to get that power back. I just feel so powerless and clueless even though this is my life and my future.\n",

I feel like none of my desired outcomes were acknowledged enough. \n\nThe first session is never going to be perfect and I'm giving her one more chance, but I'm not sure she's the right therapist for me.

        "text": "Edit: apologies this turned into a wall of text\n\nContext: NC with covert Ndad and by extension my entire FOO for 18 months. Nsis immediately took Ndad's side, and only contacted me to tell me I was crazy and she didn't like what was said about her. Since then she leaves lovebombing voicemails every few months which DH listens to on my behalf. A few years ago I got Nsis a job at my employer, so we worked together for a few months before I left that job, and she left a few months after me. I've recently returned to that employer.\n\nSince I've been back, some people have asked me in passing \"How's your sister doing?\" Initially, I would say \"she's fine\" and then change the subject back to the asker and the conversation would move on. This didn't happen often, as my teammates and the few friends I have here know to ask about my personal life (I have told 2 of them a vague version of what happened).\n\nThis morning, a colleague from a different department stopped by my desk to chat. She is a few years older than me (29F), still lives at home and is a very, very sweet person. Seriously, she is always sunshiney and optimistic. Since going NC, my ability to pick out bullshit and manipulative people has been supercharged, and she does not set off alarm bells.\n\nWhich is why I think that this happened. We were discussing my cats and she asked me about my sister. I was caught off-guard, so I replied, \"I don't know because I'm no longer in contact with her.\" She looked troubled and said she was sorry to hear that. I said it's fine, I've dealt with it and there's nothing more to be done. She nodded and we continued laughing about cats.\n\nWhen the conversation was over, she walked away...and then came back. \"You know, I'm not going to push you to talk about what happened, but I just want to tell you something about me and my sister. We also were never close and-\" \n\nI shut that shit down. \"Sorry for interrupting, but I'm setting a boundary here. This is not up for discussion, and I don't want to hear how your situation with your sister went, because you don't know what happened with me, and there is no way I can apply your situation to mine. \"\n\nShe looked shocked. \"I wasn't going to give you advice, I just wanted to let you know that there's always hope.\" I shook my head. \"No, there isn't.\" She looked sad, but then she apologised for overstepping, and said she wouldn't bring it up again. She just emailed me a cat photo.\n\nI think this is a good example of the \"good intentions\" which could easily send someone back into the FOG. Those of us on here know that there is no hope. We went NC with our Ns because *there is no other way*. Either we all would have to go back to the time when we didn't know about Ns (and therefore subject ourselves to the abuse again), or our Ns would have to change. We all know that isn't going to happen.\n\nI thought I would share this because Ndad conditioned me to always be \"nice and polite\" aka a complete fucking doormat. I am proud of how quickly and respectfully I set a boundary, with no nervous stuttering or blushing as I stood up for myself. I think it helped as well that I've known her for years, and she honestly thought she was trying to help.\n\nTL;DR A \"well-intentioned\" colleague tried to give me hope about having a relationship with Nsis. I set a boundary quickly and firmly, and we're all good.",

        "text": "Hi everyone - been lurking on this subreddit for a while, and have finally plucked up the courage to tell my experience of growing up with a nMum. Never really expressed this as one coherent story to any one before (partner / close friends know bits and pieces) so please excuse me if it's a bit jumbled :)\n\nMy parents divorced when I was young (around 3 years so, and I'm early 30s now) and nMom was granted majority custody. I never had a great relationship with her from as long as I can remember. As a kid we clashed constantly. I 100% was not the perfect child, but looking back I know realise how messed up the things she did were, things that I am only just beginning to really comprehend how they have in turn impacted me as an adult. There is the time that we argued before school, and I ended up enter into class without saying goodbye to her at the school gate (I must have been around 7 yo). Suddenly at somepoint in the middle of school day I get called to the headteachers office... My nMum is there, drunk and crying about how a son should never leave his mother without saying goodbye in case something happens and it's the last time we ever see each other - this is all in front of the headteacher. Or there's the time she got drunk at my school summer event and passed out and had to be carried home by some other parents. She was just never really interested in being a parent I think. As part of the custody agreement, I stayed with my Dad one weekday and every other weekend. He would have to wash my clothes there, because she wouldn't do laundry. I used to only be bathed at my Dads as a kid, because she would never do it herself.\n\nEventually when I was around 13, I remember calling my Dad about something nMom had done. I can't even remember what it was, but something must have snapped because he came straight round and took me to live with him and my step mum. From then on I used to stay with her twice a week, which by the time I had reached 16/17 had dwindled to one every two weeks or so for a quick 30 min visit. This initially was OK, I just had to cope with her for half an hour. But she still had her old ways. I remember when I was applying for universities, she suddenly because interested in what I wanted to study, where etc. This was all very strange, because she had never shown any interest in any aspect of my life before in the past really, certainly not my school work. But I remember thinking maybe she has changed, and wants to be more involved. But she kept asking what the address of my campus was. I thought it was weird, until after a bit of digging I realized that she needed all that information just to continue claiming some kind of child in education tax break from the government despite the fact I hadn't been living with her or been supported by her financially for around 5ish year at that stage. \n\nAnyway, the moment I finally cut her off was the day of my grandfather's 70th birthday 8 years ago. The whole extended family had come to my grandparents for a barbeque. She turned up, drunk as usual, and preceded to just be rude and obnoxious to everyone. I remember seeing my grandma almost in tears in the kitchen that day and thinking fuck this, I don't need this in my life anymore. Since that day I haven't spoken to her since, not even an SMS. I have to say that for me I have never regretted the decision. Since then I have moved countries, settled down, am in a nice job and generally pretty happy. I'm really lucky that I had an amazing dad and grandparents, it's really all down to them. I don't even want to think about where I would have ended up if I had stayed in that poisonous environment with nMum. I'm only really getting to grips with how all this has probably impacted my own personality and trust issues in later life. I thinking of talking about it with a therapist maybe (never done anything like that before so still a bit apprehensive) to try and work through some of the issues. It's still a bit tough, because I'm really close with my grandparents who live literally on the opposite side of the street to her. And i have sister (nMum's daughter with new partner) who in recent years our contact has dwindled as a result of the cutting off contact. But on the whole, 8 years I don't have one regret. It feels really liberating to be free of her to be honest.! \n\nWhat's weird though is I occasionally get pangs of guilt and she pops into my dreams occasionally. Even though hand on heart I can't say I have any desire to see her again. Has anyone else experienced this? I wondering if this is my subconscious telling me something, or is it just natural and I should ignore it? \n\ntl:dr \nHaven't spoken to nMom for 8 years. On the whole feel happy with decision and have never regretted it, but get ocassional pangs of guilt and dreams. Subconscious message or should just ignore it?",

My parents didn't  have full time jobs so it wasn't like we could afford it. \n\nI now have my own family and we have good jobs. We have a preschool aged kid and I still find it so hard to give her gifts. How many gifts is normal? How much should I spend? etc. If I limit stuff, I feel bad. If I splurge, I feel bad. It doesn't matter if I'm buying books or art supplies or Lego or whatever either. It all makes me feel weird. I only buy her stuff she's asked for or that I know she likes.\n\nMy spouse sees this as a total non issue and says everything's fine. He keeps reminding me that we spend a lot of time outdoors and having fun for free and doing stuff like baking and drawing that's not about toys or consumerism, and that she's a polite and friendly kid who doesn't ever act spoiled.\n\nSo yeah, this is my latest issue. I get excited to buy the kid a toy I know she'll love but then I feel this wave of guilt. It's no fun :(",

        "text": "My now-ex bf was married for over 10 yrs. We met in a dating site and he was listed as single. First in-person dinner, he came clean and said they were separated and almost divorced. Come to find out, the papers were’t even filed yet. I was very wary, held him at arms length for months as friends, but then started dating him. He tried so hard to win me over/earn my trust.\n\nHe talked a good game. His ex was very angry at him (turns out, he had gone onto adult dating sites/cheating sites before he even told her he wanted a divorce, while he was still sleeping in bed next to her.) Before me, he had been “dating” a married poly woman who was an alcoholic and had just had gastric bypass surgery. He’d met her twice in person but they talked every day for hours, and he’d told her he loved her. \n\nHe told me his ex wife had been clinically depressed and mean/abusive to him for years. Said she refused to work for years, spent crazy amounts of money, did not cook or clean or do anything at all except watch tv and drink beer in bed. He said she demanded he do everything for her.\n\nHe put so much into trying to be great to me that first year. Helped me with projects, made me laugh constantly, took me to dinner, just a good partner. We adopted a dog together. We took mini-trips on weekends. I spent a lot of time with his parents and friends and my friends liked him. He told me his ex would scream at him if he spent any time with his friends, and his parents and brother were not allowed into their house.\n\nHe and I remodeled his house - helped him paint the whole thing, work on the yard, rip up carpet and refinish floors. He told me nobody has ever been so good to him.\n\nA few months in, I met a female friend of his who was bizarre. She fawned over him, touching him and close-talking with him, and she gossiped about hos ex wife and also kept telling me how much money he made. It was uncomfortable and gross.\n\nAfter I met her the one time, she told him that he needed to dump me. She even got opinions from her friends - who don’t know him well and have never met me. He and I had a serious argument and he said he didn’t want her in his life. Six months later I learned he had lunch with her and hadn’t told me. I’m guessing there were more instances.\n\nIn the last six months, we very rarely have sex. Sometimes it would be once a month, other times two months apart. Some of that is on me because his personal hygiene really slipped and I was grossed out. His breath is always foul, he doesn’t shave much, his nose hair and ear gunk are funky, and he will wear clothing even when it’s dirty. \n\nHe still wanted to spend time together, but he didn’t make any plans. It was like a habit for him. We will go get dinner but he never asks in advance - even on Valentines Day.  His Xmas gift to me on xmas was expensive but so weird and not at all something I would want. \n\nWhen I had to put my dog to sleep, he didn’t call or come by, or text. When I was in a hit-and-run accident, he was at a dinner on a Friday night with the horrible woman and her family who were in town.\n\nWhen I have tried talking with him, he spins it on me: “I only see you and otherwise am home alone.”  I told him “I push you to make plans with your friends. I encourage you to have them over and go see them. This woman is the single person I have a problem with, and you told me you didn’t want her around.” He said he believes in forgiveness and her family visiting wanted to see him.\n\nI found out about the Friday dinner when he texted me the Thursday before telling me he’d been invited and was going. I asked if I was invited, he said yes but he’d said I couldn’t make it. I told him at that time how upset I was, and that if he went (especially after saying yes while uninviting me before even talking with me) it would damage our already-weak relationship. \n\nHis emotional reactions are to try to turn any upset back onto me. If I am upset, he then feels even more upset because I don’t give him the benefit of the doubt, because I don’t trust him, because he says he is a good person and has put everything into being trustworthy.\n\nIf that doesn’t work and I make valid points, he shuts down. He will not talk, he will not call or text. \n\nI broke it off with him after I realized that every time I have had an emergency and truly expected him to be with me, to support and help, to care for me - he has not only been absent, he doesn’t even text or call to check on me. \n\nHis ex called him a narcissist. I believe her. She knew better than me after being with him 10+ years. \n\nOne thing I used to say to myself when I first met him was, “If he’ll do it with you, he’ll do it to you.” I doubt he is sleeping with his friend. But he had emotional affairs on top of the physical affairs with his ex, so itnwouldn’t surprise me. \n\nI see that he NEEDS to be with someone. If not me, then he’ll be back online immediately, looking for someone to sympathize with him, to chat with him constantly, to support him. He needs constant validation and will not accept anything less than adoration.\n\nTL;DR: If you have a narcissistic ex, be happy and relieved he is your ex. My N-ex bf’s ex wife was RIGHT. ",

        "text": "I was in a relationship with my N for 20 years, from the time I was 17, been separated now for just over 2 years.  One of the things that really mind fucked me was when he would pretend for long periods of time that he liked something then hit me with the news that he hated it and just put up with it for me. It has become apparent that he is doing the same to his new girlfriend.  His timeline for fucking her over seems much faster than the one he took for me.  I've heard N's get worse as they get older so maybe that is why.  Anyway, he was here on the weekend fixing the kids bikes, and he tells me he's not at girlfriends because he doesn't really want a relationship with her, and he is sick of her touching him all the time.  That he'll see her tomorrow to keep her happy but that's it for the week.  I asked if he'd told her this.  No.  When we were together in the start he touched me all the time and I reciprocated.  Then he suddenly started getting really annoyed any time I touched him and calling me clingy.  The rest of our relationship he could touch me whenever he liked but I rarely touched him because he doesn't like it.   Similarly he let me give him oral sex regularly for several months before telling me he finds it degrading and disgusting and he doesn't know why I do it. He instigated seeing me every day from the very start of our relationship, instigated us moving in together, then cracked it that I was making him spend all his time with me not his friends.\n\nSo, here's the thing - I have been seeing a guy for 12 months who says he loves being touched.  It took awhile for me to go down on him for fear he'd be secretly disgusted.  I keep checking in that he actually likes to be touched because I'm waiting for the 'stop touching me you clingy piece of shit you disgust me' bomb to drop.  After this weekend listening to my ex I checked in again with current man that it's actually okay for me to be there when I visited him.  I can see this becoming annoying for him and I hate feeling this way.  I get this sinking feeling when we are together that he actually doesn't want me around and is being polite but is actually pissed I'm there. Another time recently my daughter told me how her Dad keeps complaining about his girlfriend wanting sex and having to 'go along with it' (I know his boundaries are atrocious to discuss that with his 17yr old daughter but nothing I can do about it) and I started to go back into my shell sexually with my new guy and go back to apologising for having sex/orgasms with him. I have no evidence from his behaviour that that he is not wanting to see me or have me touch him or have sex with him - but then, until it happened I had no inkling from the ex that that was the case either.\n\nHow do I get my head right in this new relationship and let go of the fear he's a Narc?  I'm in regular therapy (have been for 5 years) and it's really helped me leave the ex, deal with my BPD daughter better and pull my life together in many ways, but this is just persistent and too hard to discuss.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis was a really long time ago but I remembered that a few people asked for an update to my [previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/55d9i4/has_anyone_else_experienced_an_nparent_turning/)\n\nTL;DR of previous post: Nmom had become suspiciously nice several years after I moved Very Far Away, became financially independent, and became Very Low Contact. Wanted to visit for Christmas and I was suspicious but hopeful that it could work out okay. \n\nWell on to the update - it was tolerable. Nmom was definitely walking on eggshells for the entire trip. I think it's because I told my brother (GC) that this was Nmom's one chance to establish a tolerable relationship with me, and if she messed it up I would never entertain seeing her again. I think brother gave some choice advice to Nmom, which she surprisingly heeded and did not make the entire trip extremely miserable. That being said, I didn't enjoy it either and she definitely had some N-moments where I wanted to scream and pull my hair out but I instead Grey Rocked the shit out of all of our conversations. \n\nThe funny thing is I feel like she almost wanted to take the trip to prove to everyone in her life how awesome her relationship with her daughter is. She took so many pictures of us together at prominent landmarks in my city and sent them to basically everyone. It's like \"See! I told you I'm a great parent! My child actually interacts with meeeee!\". Like this visit was a means for her to validate herself to the rest of the world, so instead of her typical focus on creating drama and ruining my life, her focus was for us to get as many photos as possible. Which, hey, I don't really mind. My city is a prominent tourist spot and I'm used to playing tour guide for visiting friends and family. \n\nIt's clear that she realizes she no longer has the financial and emotional leverage on me she once had. This rude awakening for her probably made her realize she needs to play nice if she wants any semblance of a relationship. I think in the back of her mind she is possibly scheming how she could regain the control she once had, so I will continue to stay vigilant by having all of my shit locked down and maintaining very strict rules regarding my contact with her. Also doesn't hurt that she's currently distracted by much shinier targets in her life right now - she recently got a new boyfriend, plus she continues to obsess over my GC brother who lives much closer to her. \n\nAll in all, I'd call it a success and will continue to maintain Low Contact / Structured Contact. At the time of writing this it has been over 1 year since seeing her, and I may even spend an overnight at her place when I visit my home town in July, as long as she can remain tolerable. Goes without saying, I will continue to Grey Rock, Information Diet, avoid the Flying Monkeys, and never JADE. Thank you as always for the advice and support of this great community!",

It's funny how sometimes I still wonder if things would work out if I had done something differently. I know Nex is sick, can't do anything to have things 'work out' and I am no saint nor professional, it's not my job. But it's just.. You know? I feel like we had a life together, things would be 'perfect'(cliche af, I know) if he wasn't so sick/ abusive. I felt like I've finally found someone I like a lot, who's mature, geeky, hot and got his shit together. He's like a dream come true. Met him by accident, what are the odds?  I remember telling myself - I can't screw this  up, this is different, I can't be a shit kid anymore, I want this to be something, I got to be careful with this one and play it right. So I tried very hard, I learn to be chill, not get overly jealous or clingy, try to communicate when needed. But it just didn't feel like I am enough. Look at me now, I am such a mess. I thought I am already over the 'lose appetite' and feel sad all day phase. Turns out no. I really just wanted things to work, whydid he throw everything that couldve been away? just like that?\n\nIt honestly sting to remind myself from time to time, that he doesnt care about me at all. It;s been two months, he did not try to win you back, to make things right, to communicate, all he did was pulling his stupid, unsincere hoovering techniques. All he cares is to win when all I ever wanted was us to be happy and things to work out.",
