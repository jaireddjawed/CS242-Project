Much less people are proficient with tech than you think. Than you have the idiots who think because they can build a modern computer or root their Android phone that they can become quants. \n\nThe second reality is just because someone knows how to build X with Python, doesn’t mean they know how to implement it along with the labyrinth of processes involved in development within enterprise environments. While an AI can create X code, making sure it’s not going to fuck up production along with having proper process such as for change management is something only a person can do. An idiot with an AI is dangerous as fuck. An experienced, tenured dev with an AI is going to be very productive. Much like how excel or the calculator didn’t destroy the accountant and instead supercharged their productivity and scale. \n\nPeople who think AI is something you can just have a product manager plug in to get something out of it don’t know shit and have literally never worked in the industry",

I have two good friends from India who are really cool guys and one from Pakistan and another from Bangladesh. You can joke with them however you want and they are easy to get along with. But, Indian tech workers are a whole other story.\n\nI have two on my team, 1 is QA and the other is an SWE. Both live and work out of India. These guys never say anything during meetings, drag their feet when given a ticket, and the work they do get done we end up having to go back to fix it because it's buggy as hell. They slow the entire team down. At first, I thought it was a language barrier, English is not my first language either, so I can understand. But, whenever I interact with them or look at their work, they speak and write English just fine. Our entire tech support team is also based out of India and is infamous for getting nothing done.\n\nI worked with a few Indians at my previous company and the story was much of the same. There was one guy who was a senior engineer and he was smart as hell, dude was a machine. But, he was so hard to work with and, for lack of a better term, was a condescending asshole. In another experience, I interviewed with Oracle once and all of my interviewers were Indian. When I got the email I had a bad feeling as soon as I see the list of names. Sure enough, 3 out of the 4 were, for lack of a better term, condescending assholes. But, one of the guys was cool as hell. It's such a dichotomy with these guys.\n\nAnyway, at my current job, I brought the issues up to my manager and he told me that this is not the first time they have had issues with \"overseas\" employees. In the past, they hired \"overseas\" contractors from Cognizant and it was even worse with them. The jest of it is that my company saves a boatload of money on overseas people. On paper this looks great, the company saves money, diversity goes up, and gives poorer nations a leg up in the global economy. But, in my experience, the cultural differences are just too vast.\n\nWhen I asked my friends about this they said it is the \"culture back home\". People are not going to go out of their way for an employer as we do in the west. I can understand if your working some shit job, but this is tech. You are working from home and it is fairly laid back with good pay. Again, I think the work culture differences between India and the West are too distinct. \n\nEnd of rant.",

I have a BSc in CS but I have 0 projects outside of uni assignments, due to having to work part time to support myself during my studies. I got rejected for Junior positions by multiple companies, and I was so desperate, that I accepted a job for a large insurance group due to desperation. \n\nThey told me the pay would be lower because they would have to spend probably a year training me in the language (OpenInsight/Basic+ if that matters) and the systems they're working with. At this point, I just said fuck it and accepted the offer, just so I can finally have my foot in the door. \n\nWell, I think I'm doing really well at my job, the colleagues are great but... While I write code, a lot of it has nothing to do with what most software companies are looking for. Like, say I get fired the next day (and with the recent layoffs, wouldn't surprise me), and my skills are now literally useless because nobody else seems to use that ancient language and those obscure frameworks with no documentation.\n\nI just feel so fed up with everything - I feel like I wasted my years getting that BSc in computer science, and ending up so desperate, that I now earn as much as a warehouse worker (no disrespect because I used to be one) while having to decipher Cthulu's diary. Not to mention that we are a large team, yet the turnover rate is way too high for a software dev team! I've been here for 6 months and 1 person has to be replaced by a new desperate graduate every single month due to the low pay. Hell, if I go back to doing call centre work, I will probably earn more but at this point, I'd rather drink battery acid than ever work with customers again. \n\nIs there any chance I can find a job for a proper software development company? At uni, I did C, Java and Python but I haven't really done any notable projects and I don't know what I want to do. I think I'm going to swallow my pride, start a new software dev course, learn an in demand framework, and finally update my GitHub profile so it's actually worth something. If that doesn't work out... Well, I guess I can go back to call centre work and sustain myself on opiates.",

I've been told a few times DevOps is a great field to get into, and recently saw some ad for the University of Chicago where it said something to the effect of \"communication\" being the #1 skill for a DevOps engineer.  It didn't list any requirements as far as programming or anything, but maybe that's what it would teach you or they are just willing to take your money, I don't know.\n\nI've heard people suggest DevOps a few times as a possible career path - but whenever I see people talk about it, it sounds more like a role you move into after years as a software engineer or something. Which made the ad for an 8 week course even more confusing.\n\n1. If I've learned anything, communication has always been a valuable skill - but would me being personable and able to communicate/work well with people be a more desirable skill that would help me land a DevOps role? Assuming I studied and learned the other necessary skills.\n2. My background is in software and business, but not in a primarily technical capacity like programming or anything like that  -  would it be possible for someone who's self-taught everywhere else change into a DevOps role? Or would years of actual software engineering experience be required?\n\nI am just trying to find a path forward into a more technically focused career and if I can leverage any of my previous years of work experience to get into an area faster, I'd like to do that. I guess I'm asking for the best way, or if DevOps would be a good/viable path?",

I'm a 21 year old art school dropout (and gifted-kid-burnout) with very little math classes under my belt, but my brain has always vibed really well with computers so I had started looking into programming as a career &amp; teaching myself. The issue is I hear a lot more negative outlooks when it comes to people with no degree or related background. It's not that I'm bad at math— I have learned to really enjoy it now that it has a purpose. The Mathematician's Lament and whatnot. I just don't have those years of experience that some kids had, with say, a coding club or an AP Stats class. So would it still be a worthwhile idea for me to seek out something like a 2 year CS program at a community college? Degrees make a difference, I know, but I worry that I will have to spend a bunch of time money taking prerequisites, and that those prerequisites will kill the joy of learning before I even get to the meat and potatoes of the degree. I am no well-disciplined engineer or physicist. (But really, who knows? Maybe it's not so bad either; I've changed a lot since high school.) \n\nI don't really need or desire to have a fancy software engineering job. I like to think I would be just fine as a little background code monkey, but either way I would have to get there somehow too. I'm not necessarily asking for a shortcut because I know how to buckle down when it's necessary. I just struggle in ways other people might not, so I want to approach this in a way that won't fry my brain and leave me giving up to flip burgers forever. \n\nOh yeah, important addition: right now I am taking Harvard's online CS50 course, the free version without the certificate. Obviously that doesn't replace a whole college degree of any kind, but it seems like a good way to get a wide range of basic knowledge / a point for jumping off of. If I stick with this to the end, or even go back and pay for the ceritifcate, do you think that would be a better first step to take before trying to pursue a BS, or can you go into that as a beginner too? Or is there some other type of degree or certification that I might be unaware of as a good starting point? \n\nSorry if this is sounds stupid or ignorant. Not everyone is cut out for a classroom environment and I just want to do this in the most beneficial way I can, both for my mental health and financial security. Whatever I do with my life, I want to be able to support myself and enjoy what I do, and I really enjoy computer science so far. I don't want to screw that up.",

There's an easily demonstratable value proposition. Phase 1 is me taking a bunch of out of the box parts and orchestrating them in a way that creates some turnkey value. Phase two though is probably where the larger value proposition comes in and not that I can't do it myself I just can't do it myself quickly.

I got into a grad program for ML but the prof ended up doing some really stupid things and lost funding for the lab so I didn't take it. I've decided to suck it up, not go back to grad school, and figured it would be better to just transition into a ML implementation type role rather than theoretical.\n\nI have very little on my resume to indicate my knowledge. I do have a patent under my name for a method to improve training times at the expense of performance, but it's pretty trivial. I have a conference submission that was rejected. All of my ML related stuff was built in college and at my first real job, which was 2 jobs ago. Programming itself is pretty trivial and I can ace most coding interviews. I could probably code an MLP by hand, but at this point I'd use huggingface or something similar for more complicated models. I forgot how transformers work exactly besides the whole attention thing.\n\nShould I get AWS ML certified? Should I build some more stupid side projects that nobody uses? Should I compete in Kaggle competitions? What kind of stuff do you want to see as a hiring manager?",

Even with said experience in these industries and others,  I am finding it hard to re-enter the industry or get the roles for which I have experience in and or certification's/qualifications for but no experience, catch 22. Not just in this year but in prior years also.\n\nSo am wanting to switch careers. I am currently in the process of learning Python at home but am double minded about self learning and getting a qualification. Wondering if going back to university would be worth it, taking on the additional debt? (Probably is), already have existing debt from prior degree. \n\nIn NZ there are no apprenticeship programs like that in the UK and USA that I have come across, zilch, nada, nothing. Is there any qualification/certificate I can get online or in a country that I could migrate to that would be worth it's weight and get me a job? I have gotten other certifications with which I still can't get a job with (Different industry) and don't want to spend the $ where I can't get a ROI. As in keep getting certifications but be of no use. I know this may not be the case in IT but thought it is worth mentioning. \n\nNow with all these companies lying people off unfortunately and others following suite, I am sure there are more than enough qualified or over qualified people for the roles I would apply for, in that case is it worth going this route?\n\nIf anyone has any experience in relation to what I have written, can relate or has any tips or tricks, ideas or anything, please feel free to share. \n\nThank you.",

Seems like a workaholic, puts in a lot of work and does a lot. Your typical Startup Software Engineer, self starter, is able to work on various parts of the code, open's PR's left and right about unrelated things, kind of all over the place.  \n\n\nHe's one of the founding engineers in the startup, very well known in the company. There is a piece of code that is super important to our Startup. We use that all the time. The only guy in our company that knows that piece of code by heart is this kid.\n\nWe have other engineers that are Older / Younger then me, and also better skilled and worse skilled than me. All of us have attempted to work with this piece of code and we all have terrible experiences with it.   \n\n\nThe piece of code Frankie knows is not too much, maybe 30-40 files. But CRUCIAL to our System.   \n\n\n* It is VERY BUGGY we don't even know how many bugs are there. Luckily for this - we do not have any customers yet. Frankie does not have the maturity to understand how productionalized software is implemented and deployed. if the MAIN UNIT TEST PASSES - PR IS UP.\n* I think also since he is working so much and trying to seem IMPORTANT and prove himself, HE CUTS CORNERS, and does not implement FULL solutions, leading to unexpected behavior. Again, let me remind you, HARD TO POINT FINGERS AT THE GUY CAUSE REALLY LOVED BY COMPANY.\n* It is written as if a Physics guy coded it. One function does a million things.\n* There is no clear pattern / no paradigm / really difficult to see the flow of execution. How the problem is being solved by it.... It's supposed to be a GRAPH ALGORITHM but we have no fucking idea which part is which.\n* There are files that are 2k lines long, and functions that are as long as 500 lines. There are multiple classes in the same file.\n* We have an Architect - and we have brought this to attention but all of us are kind of \"afraid\" to complain about this piece of code. But we all agree that it is something that needs immediate attention, as it is destroying our team velocity. Frankie is supposed to look into it -- but I think he likes being irreplaceable (idk this is just a weird thought, ye?)\n* We are dealing with Parallel C++ -- and it is an absolute nightmare to deal with this part of the code, in the shape that it is. Meanwhile -- when you have a discussion with Frankie and explain the problem, he can very easily point you out to the Ambiguous function that handles that.\n* This guy is also our Technical Lead - sigh. \n* He is a REALLY REALLY NICE GUY -- LOVE HIM - I just don't know how the fuck to approach this so that we don't seem like we are pointing fingers or something?   \n\n\nAlright, what the fuck do we do?   \n\n\nWould appreciate some suggestions on how to handle this. Though, please keep in mind, none of us want to seem like BAD people during these fucking layoffs.",

CSS is the design, the colors, the spacing etc. Javascript is the behavior so if you want popups for example. \n\nWhen things are laid out like this I can make sense of it, I get the product (website), the dissection of the website (front end, back end &amp; an example of a language that makes each component of the website workable (Html for the words, CSS for the design, Javascript for the behavior, making the page interactive). \n\nI learned that bit because I understood what the end goal was, &amp; learned what was needed to produce that end goal, now I am looking for the end goal of employers so I can figure out what is needed to produce those goals &amp; later how I can be proficient in those goals BUT I cannot find anything that doesn't include \"everything\" &amp; I can't start \"everywhere\" &amp; I need to know the outcome of the things I learn industry wise before I sit down to learn it.\n\nEven just writing this question is frustrating because I'm having a hard time knowing exactly what to ask... None of these job titles mean anything so I need to know what I'm doing based off of job description instead? Like huh???",

I am ultimately interested in either a SWE or data engineering/science role.\n\nI am (incredibly lucky and grateful to be) deciding between two internships and was hoping for some input on what would better set me up for a career in SWE or data engineering:\n\n1. Security automation engineering at a lesser known F100 company: in person (which doesn't bother me) in a smaller city that I'm not super interested in (but relocation/housing are covered which is nice), $23/hour (considering negotiating higher if possible - would hope for $26/27). I don't know much about the field, but am interested in automation and pipeline development (though long-term likely not in a security field).\n2. Reporting/Data analytics at a large healthcare company (worked there last summer too, but different team), fully remote, $27/hour (might try to negotiate to $28/29 but unlikely to get that). This field is very similar to my previous major which I'm still somewhat interested in, but I was hoping to break more into a CS-related field if possible and don't want to pigeonhole myself in health data too early on.\n\nAny and all thoughts are much appreciated!",

I would  say currently my finance/accounting \"career/projects\" are much more  \"impressive\" than my CS stuff as I have been doing them for years. I still  love CS and I do plan on perusing a career around it.\n\nI am currently applying to more CS based jobs/ internships and am worried about making promises I can't keep. I had a previous internship during my freshman year but I was basically a data entry \"intern\" which was not really related to cs but I did get to work from home and had extremely flexible hours which was great. They told me if I ever need a job I can work for them again but they pay less than retail.  I also have a job setup this fall to teach python as an \"intern\".\n\nShould I peruse this? Does it make sense to?\n\nFrom what am reading from their website they will hire me directly into an upper level position as an intern and offer me paid training basically. The job requirements are low but from what am reading it is a long training process (around 1 year actual training with constant training in career). Income looks good as well. \n\nI pledged to myself last year would be my final year in retail/warehouses. I am forcing myself to find an internship or else I don't work at all.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a UK biomed graduate, who has recently decided to go into CS. My main intention would be to hopefully go into bionics/biotech, so as to be able to combine my knowledge of both fields. Moreover, I am paticularly interested in advanced limb prosthetics restoring function to amputees. \n\nSo far, I have about a year's worth of Python knowledge and I have enrolled in an MSc in Data Science and AI, which I wil be graduating from in 2024. \n\nMy concern is, trying to make the best out of the time that I have available to acquire and improve the necessary skillset for this career path. However, I have struggled to find info on the sort of skills (other than AI and ML)  that I would need to pursue bionics. \n\nAlso, given how early I am in my career, and the likelihood of me getting a CS job is quite slim, I'm wondering how I could develop said skills and make them marketable, as I am concerned that I won't be taken seriously if I only have coding in my free time on my CV and not a job position. Moreover, my current employer will be making me redundant in 8 months, so I'm really hoping that I can get another bio job, or even a CS job before I get kicked out.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What sort of CS skills should I be looking into for Bionics/Biotech, other than Python, ML and AI?\n2. Is there any way I could make myself more hireable to future employers, if I only have small amounts of experience, but still showed potential with my MSc? Also do you guys know of any sites with job postings for this level of experience?\n3. Would it be useful, if I managed to get a CS position in a different background, say graduate consulting, cybersecurity, or fintech, if it just meant having something on my CV?\n\nLast question is for anyone that has gone down a similar route to the one I'm planning. How did you get into biotech with CS? What sort of things did you do to get into your career and how did you progress?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",

While browsing Linked, I found a job that I think would be perfect fit. \n\nObviously due to not graduating for another year, I don't think they'd appreciate me applying this early and I can guess that it would be filled by the time I'm handed my diploma.\n\nMy question is this: How do I get my foot in the door or rather name in the heads of people I'd like to work for, aside from submitting a resume? For any hiring managers in CS Fields, would this look too eager or reflect poorly on me for reaching out? How would you treat someone like myself?",

However, due to my lack of knowledge about this topic, I wanted to ask a few questions to those of you are taking this path (or already have taken it).\n1 - First of all, since Algorithms is a pretty large area, I wanted to know in which subarea you focused (whether it was in graphs algorithms, big data algorithms, machine learning algorithms, and so on). \n2 - I also would like to know what your routine was like during your PhD years (Was your work more on the theory part or was it divided between theory and practice/implementation/coding?). \n3 - Were you able to get internships during your PhD? If so, what was your experience like? Did you enjoy it? What were your tasks in such internship?\n4 - Once people get a PhD in this area, what are their career options? \n\nThanks in advance.",
