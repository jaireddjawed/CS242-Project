With 1 year left of my degrees, I'm feeling the pressure pile on for what the hell I want to do in the future. Learning Spanish has sparked my passion for languages and the study of language and I was thinking of pursuing a Masters in linguistics following my degree but I recently read a thread on this sub asking how many linguists with linguistic degrees/credentials actually pursued careers in the field and all the answers left me feeling very grim. I've always been in love with English, reading and writing, and until I began studying Spanish I didn't realise my passion extended to the history and concept of language in general. I'd love some advice on careers that exist or pathways I could pursue that would allow me to explore my passion and love of languages. Teaching and speech pathology are of no interest to me, im mostly interested in etymology and the history of how language came to be and how languages intertwine and intercept with eachother, the similarities and differences between languages, research and writing. Thanks for the help!",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

I am reading the *Oxford Handbook of Construction Grammar* (2013) and find the following confusing:\n\nBarðdal, the author of chapter 23 which deals with historical-comparative reconstruction, says that Old Norse/Icelandic and Latin have an Acc-Gen construction, which Ancient Greek does not, and that only Old Norse/Icelandic has an Acc-Acc construction (pp. 443f.)\n\nI work mainly with Ancient Greek and find this confusing for several reasons. The first is that I am not really able to find out exactly what she means by an Acc-Acc or an Acc-Gen construction. \n\nThe second is that Ancient Greek has constructions that appear to fit the bill for both. For instance, words that mean accusing somebody of something take the accused in accusative and the thing they are accused of. \n\nAn example from Demosthenes's speech *Against Meidias*:\n\n&gt; ei tou pragmatos aitiônt' eme    \n&gt; if the-matter.GEN they-would-accuse.OPT me.ACC    \n&gt; \"[he promised to pay them] if they would accuse me of this matter.\"\n\n\nI would expect this to be well-known to anybody working with Ancient Greek, so I then I must assume that she refers to some other sort of construction.\n\nLooking at her 2007 paper \"The semantic and lexical range of the ditransitive construction in the history of (North) Germanic\" suggests that she is talking about ditransitive constructions, and I would indeed agree that the Ancient Greek construction doesn't really seem ditransitive. In the *Handbook*, however, she appears to be talking about \"Argument Structure constructions\" (*Handbook*, p. 443) more generally, and while I am far from being intimately familiar with the ins and outs of the various constructions of Construction Grammar, I would have thought that the abovementioned construction should be an Argument Structure construction?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",

        "text": "tl;dr: trying to improve my pronunciation by recording my speech and playing it back with a \"smart\" delay. Will it work?\n\nI'm playing around with the idea of continuously recording oneself and automatically playing it back when not speaking. Sort of like a delay, but utterance-based. The goal is to improve pronunciation.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. When it detects a rise in volume, it starts recording\n2. When it detects silence, it stops the recording and plays the audio back\n\nWorks best with a Bluetooth headset like airpods.\n\nYou can play with it here: https://delay--katspaugh.repl.co/  \nSource code: [https://replit.com/@katspaugh/Delay#script.js](https://replit.com/@katspaugh/Delay#script.js)\n\nMethodologically, the idea is to practice in everyday life. As a complement to sitting in a phonetics lab, painstakingly recording and analyzing the spectrogram.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? Cheers!",

        "text": "I've made a thread on this topic before but I have some slightly different questions + want a critique. \n\n*I'm trying to look for what is standard/neutral or closest to it for these two sounds.* In phonology I've read that the standard sound for /ʝ/ is \\[ʝ\\] but that it is more commonly realised as the approximant, \\[j\\]. However I've also heard that though there is a region of Latin America that says \\[j\\] for /ʝ/, the perception can still be that you're foreign because you're saying \\[j\\] over \\[ʝ\\]. I have a friend who is a native Spanish speaker but not primary speaker who has been critiquing my Spanish and when I try to say \\[j\\] he says he mentally registers it as if I'm saying /i/, i.e. if I said ayer with a \\[j\\] he thinks I'm saying aier, which I can hear why he is saying that but I'm confused about what the approximant is if it's not supposed to be \\[j\\]. I also find \\[ʝ\\] hard to say pretty fast so:\n\n* **1) I'm wondering do Spanish speakers ever say the approximant (\\[j\\]) or do they just say \\[ʝ\\] all the time.** \n* **2) If the approximant (\\[j\\]) is said, is the perception of it being a vocal or /i/ really true or widespread?** \n\nSecond part is about \\[ɟʝ\\] or \\[dʒ\\]. I've read that depending on what y/ll is next to you may say either or. \n\n* **1) I'm not sure if this is \"standard\" or neutral to do this and** \n* **2) does it make a difference if you say one or the other? I've seen \\[ɟʝ\\] primarily in phonology when looking at Spanish phonemes and not nearly \\[dʒ\\] as much though they almost sound identical to me, and in a similar fashion I feel that way about \\[j\\] versus \\[ʝ\\]. Just wondering is \\[dʒ\\] even correct to say in Spanish and if it's only \\[ɟʝ\\].**\n\n**3) Now this leads to the pronunciation critique. I'm saying mostly random words and then two common phrases. Same stuff said in both clips.** \n\nIn this link I'm trying to use \\[ʝ\\] and \\[ɟʝ\\]. [Link here](https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/4au3h5njfvet40p2)\n\nSecond link is \\[j\\] and \\[dʒ\\]. [Link here](https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/vz7pkh7djha78kcg)\n\nMain focus is on the four sounds but any general critiques outside of that are welcome",
