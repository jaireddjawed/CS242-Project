But eventually if we will be able to reach the bottom of the rabbit hole and find the endpoint that everything is created by this entity or physical phenomenon we still have that question how is that exists. \n\nI think the only answer is time travel. Something has to be created by itself. Maybe its our universe and the big bang was caused by a positive feed back loop of a time machine, maybe its the universe above us. How physicist can reject the notion or the possibility of time travel when by just simple logic it has to exist?",

And oh boy i was wrong.\nI went down the rabbit hole of hidden variable theories and finally ended on superdeterminism and then i started questioning my whole motive.\n\nI may be wrong in assuming this, and please tell me if am, but i don't see how the mathematical tools smart people use to describe the universe would change wether a particle's position is definite before measurement or not. If measurement is the only way to view anything, and viewing is the only way to know something exist, then \"exist\" is really just a placeholder for \"can be viewed\", and wether something is actually there in reality (whatever that even means) or not doesn't matter, because if you can't observe it you can't use it, and if you can't use it it won't affect physics right?\n\nSo if i am right, why does this seem like something that physicist still argue over, and if I'm wrong what mental gymnastics did i fuck up lol",

        "text": "Hello, I don't usually use reddit. I created this account essentially to lurk. However, I do have a question. I am currently 25-year-old Community College student in California, USA. I recently went back to college last year after a prolonged layoff. I have wrapped up my General Ed and am set to transfer. I have decided after a long time that I want to be a Physicist. I always interested in the idea going far back as middle school but never really committed to it. Then I dropped out of college a few years ago to work which while not great was tolerable. And then pandemic happened, and my place of work went of business. I did try to get another job but then I caught COVID, and after that I just felt frustrated and decided to be a NEET for the next year or so. Now that I am back on feet education-wise; Is it actually feasible? I spoke to my professors about this. Most of them went the traditional route and couldn't really provide answer. While one of them let's call him Professor X said he was in a similar to me when he started his Physics journey. However, the key difference between me and Professor X is that he already had a Bachelor's (in History) prior and came from a pretty wealthy background to boot. I don't really have anything like that to fall back on. Any additional advice? Or Tips? I would be thankful for anything you would have to say.",

Is that correct?\n\nIf so, is there a non-ridiculous way of making it possible to travel to a point before the wormhole was created? Is this just a fundamental impossibility?

You push push push but the couch doesn't budge. You push push push more. Finally it starts to move, and you find yourself flailing through the air now that you feel less resistance. Let's call this brief time that you're flailing through the air a \"lurch.\"\n\nThis is a great example of the difference between static friction and kinetic friction. Suppose the couch has a mass of 142 kg, and between the couch and the floor there's a coefficient of static friction of 0.520 and a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.245. If your lurch lasts 6.83 milliseconds, how fast (in meters per second) do you and the couch move?\n\nAs always, you're moving this couch on Earth.\"",

Somedays its worst other days it better and no noise. Sometimes the noise follows a pattern so I could hear a knock from fridge wall then immediately from the ceiling then the wall one by one as if if someone quickly tapped at all 3 places.\n\nThere are no faulty pipes or pests issue in my home. So thats ruled out. It also doesnt explain why internal items making such noise and whats with the patern sometimes.\n\nI noticed it didnt happen at all in summer. Could this be related to temerature changes? But how to explain the strange pattern of knocking happening in quick succession in different things?",

So in this tiktok, it was someone playing a Wild West video game, where a person was tied behind a moving train- however, the train was moving so fast that the body was suspended in the air behind in the train. So my question is, how fast is the minimum speed the train would have to go for the “thing” tied behind the train to not be touching the ground. I would prefer not to ignore the effects of drag and air resistance. If anyone has any insight, it would be greatly appreciated, as I have spent too much time at my whiteboard trying to figure this out.",

I try to take time to understand the problems that are given to me by looking at YouTube videos that go more in-depth into the topic I am studying; I also review my textbook frequently. However, I usually spend so much time trying to understand the topic that I am studying that I end up not having enough time to complete my other assignments for other classes. Are there tips that you guys have that you found to be effective in learning a topic quickly while still gaining an intuitive understanding of it? \n\nThanks,\n\nTommy",
