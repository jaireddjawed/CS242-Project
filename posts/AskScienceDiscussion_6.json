I was trying to teach an AI system how to build a special type of simulation system and it pointed out some things that could be related to real physics. And it got kind of crazy from there. :) \n\nI'd like to discuss it. Even if it's wrong it's a pretty darn cool concept...  \ntries to explain what we are missing in regards to spooky action at a distance.   \nkeyword attempts :) but even if it is wrong it is still applicable to the use case of creating a simulation system. so meh. I dunno.  \n\n\nI have wild ideas a lot so I am probably way off base :)\n\nI posted a huge post about it on steem. but I know everyone has TLDR these days when it comes to ideas.\n\nJust to really briefly summarize.\n\n\\--\n\nThe theory of a black hole sub-topology, combined with the idea that the universe has a virtual component, provides a new perspective on the concept of reality. If this theory is true, it would mean that the universe is not a simulation, but rather it has an additional virtual component that has grown and evolved alongside the physical universe. This virtual component is responsible for maintaining causality and the laws of physics that govern the observable universe via the use of virtual properties of particles and the use of routing entanglement wormholes through the sub topology and it's virtual components.    \n\n\nThis theory of black hole sub topology and virtualization should alleviate any fears people have about being in a simulation or that they may be a simulated being and replaces simulation theory completely. It is a new way of looking at the universe that is not only scientifically sound but also helps us understand our place in the world. It is also a theory that can be validated through experiments and tests, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about the universe and our place in it",

I found this paragraph on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis#Background):  \n&gt; There are two main interpretations for this disparity: either the universe began with a small preference for matter (total baryonic number of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second point of view is preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.   \n\nTo me asymmetry in the beginning makes a lot of sense:\nWe have no idea what predates/caused the big bang in the first place so the idea that it's composition is not symmetrical shouldn't bother us too much and isn't breaking any particle physics.    \n\nI realize that both theories are possible, but the attempt to find new particle interactions to explain the imbalance seems more forced to me - yet the opposite seems to be the consensus.",

Not measuring other\nthings with photons.  No bright background.\n \n&gt; For the former, there is no 'detection time' that matters with \n&gt; wavelength. We hold open the detector (camera shutter in your \n&gt; example) and record the energy dose within that time. \n\nMy question is: What is the shortest time that the camera shutter \ncan be open and still be able to detect a photon?  I expect that \nthe time varies with the detector, so it must vary with wavelength \nas well, since different kinds of detectors are used to detect \ndifferent parts of the spectrum.\n \n&gt; If we are sensitive enough we can measure the power absorbed.\n \nI'm not interested in measuring the power, since that would be a \nknown quantity in the experimental setup.  The energy/wavelength/\nfrequency of the photons would be known.  What I want to learn is \nthe minimum time required to detect a single photon.\n \n&gt; As someone else mentioned we can use very fast pulses as a kind of \n&gt; strobe light to observe processes.\n \nYes, but that is not what I asked.  I asked about single photons, \nnot pulses, and I asked about detecting those photons, not about\nusing the photons to observe other things.\n \n&gt; We can detect single photons of radio waves. It's all about detector \n&gt; sensitivity since the energy is smaller. \n&gt; https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2019/tnw/listening-to-quantum-radio/\n \nThis is new to me.  The article does not explicitly claim that they \nhave detected individual radio-frequency quanta.  It sounds instead \nlike (at the time of writing) they may have reached a level of a few \nquanta, and possibly hope to eventually make single-quantum detections. \nIt says, \"... opening up the potential for sensing radio waves at the \nquantum level.\"  The article doesn't specify the wavelength/frequency \nor the source of the radio waves, or how they verified detections.\n \n   -- Jeff, in Minneapolis",

Looking at math as a foreign language can improve your study procedures. Learning how to speak math as a language is the key to math success. Currently, most universities consider computer and statistics (a form of math) courses as foreign language courses. Some universities have now gone so far as to actually classify math as foreign language. In the case of a foreign language, if you \ndo not practice the language, what happens? You forget it. If you do not practice math, what happens? You are likely to forget it, too. Students who excel in a foreign language must practice it every day. The same study skills apply to math, because it is considered a foreign language. \n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;   Like a foreign language, math has unfamiliar vocabulary words or terms, which must be put in sentences called expressions or equations. Understanding and solving a math equation is similar to speaking and understanding a sentence in a foreign language. Listen to yourself or others as they explain a math equation. They are taking mathematical symbols and translating them into words and sentences. \n\n\n![]( https://i.stack.imgur.com/UX6Zb.jpg)\n\nIn 1987, [Joseph Newmark](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mmk/Teaching/MathLogic/index.html) and Frances Lake published [*Mathematics as a Second Language (4th ed)*.](https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2631519) [Newmark received his BS and MS degrees in mathematics from Brooklyn College, and his PhD in Operations Research from New York University.](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JYtf9cfWUKUJ:https://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/Faculty/Newmark_/&amp;hl=en&amp;strip=0&amp;vwsrc=1)\n\n## https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/q/26000",

        "text": "I understand that a black hole pulls so hard that the masses moving through it get stretched to a ridiculous degree, and I imagine like the high speed on a multi speed dough sheeter: dough is pinched between two rollers, the conveyor belt on the far end pulls faster than the one on the near end, stretching the dough.\n\nThe astronaut is stationary within the craft (\"pinched\" here, metaphorically, meaning in a relatively fixed position on one end of the event horizon; and on the other end, pulled away at very high velocity into the black hole, causing stretching from the side pulling). \n\nBut the dough sheeter only stretches the dough when the high speed (meaning the faster of two speeds on the one at my work) is being utilized; the first speed maintains the same speed on both sides and the dough technically stretches only because of those machines you're flattening the dough, which doesn't happen in the spacecraft; the passenger is in a fixed position and isn't getting flattened by the craft. That's where the metaphor ends.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering that if this is comparable, could spaghettification be avoided if you can enter the black hole at a high enough speed that the difference is relatively small, and the event horizon no longer stretches because even though a force sucks the craft in, the tension applied on the ship is below the tensile strength of the craft?\n\nNot sure about after you get sucked in, so one more question: the spacecraft would get squashed by a diminishing volume, correct? Am I correct in thinking that some sort of hyper dense material (\"hyper dense\" meaning \"ludicrously, unbelievably or unimaginably dense\") with a currently unheard of compression strength would resist compression by a black hole?\n\nI know the numbers I'm asking about are not realistic to any known substance, or at least I think they are. I.e. I'm guessing that a graphene/diamond ship (IDK, they are dense materials right?) with walls of such a thickness that the ship is barely able to fit entirely through the black hole and just enough space for a single astronaut, basic life support systems, and a week's worth of food, probably wouldn't make it through the black hole because wouldn't it get super compressed?\n\nSorry if this is way off base. Just wondering about some thought experiments and thinking about black holes. Corrections are appreciated.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/109snhg/are_most_differences_between_men_and_women_in/",
        "text": "I believe they are. Imagine a young boy being told that \"boys dont cry\"(i believe it works with anything like \"man up\" or other masculinity emphasizing phrases as well that go against our feelings). This is probably coming from a source the boy trusts but not acting accordingly is also likely despised by the people the boys age he respects so he has extra motivations to act accordingly. So now he believes he isnt supposed to cry but his feelings are telling him that crying is exactly what he's supposed to do. This will happen every time the boy wants to cry.\n\nSo what happens? The boy begins to not trust his feelings because they keep lying to him about the crying. So as he grows up he will show less feelings and he will listen less to his feelings.\n\nBut feelings are so much more than happy or sad. Feelings are what you do when you dont know what to do. But then if you dont trust your feelings and you dont know what to do, you get stuck. But if you dont know how to even comprehend it, you will likely then use your feeling to figure out what to do. This is important when forming empathy and moral compasses which are developed early in life when you likely dont have a way of comprehending these things in any other way. Empathy becomes annoying or frowned upon by boys. Hence they are less likely to listen to empathy, which will be interpreted by others (adults) as poor empathy skills.\n\nFeelings also track to school as listening less to your empathy while doing maths is helpful since math is purely logical, you dont need any help from your feelings but if you feel like you do, math will make much less sense. But doing languages or the basic learning to speak and learning to pronounce and read all need feelings because unlike maths we dont have an obvious ruleset to learn those things. Would make sense thats why boys often have harder time learning those things. Also explains why girls are often more into fantasy books because listening to your feelings more will help you enjoy a fantasy book easier. And why girls may be more into art.\n\nSo basically, humanist subjects will be easier for some1 who likes empathy and for some1 who despises it, harder and the opposite being true for sciences but theres an important exception: sciences are only hard for feeling trusting students because you need to learn rules and your feelings are telling you to make sense of it already and hence making assumptions too early but this is not true anymore when the students have learned the rules. This is actually when feelings surpass non-feelings, since feelings based on correct facts are likely the fastest way to think - even faster than trying to go by the logic they try to teach in science and math classes. And thats when boys who still trust their feelings a little more will surpass the boys who dont, ie. the kids who are bullied for that exact reason ie. nerds.\n\nThe 3 previous paragraphs are all causes for the fact that men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people, which is shown by the statistic of more men being into machines, computers, engineering and other stuff that requires no empathy and women being more into animals, people, healthcare, psychology, biology and other stuff that includes having empathy.\n\nIve seen the babies who have been made to either choose a doll to play with or a car to play with and this obviously doesnt explain it. Maybe the slight bias needed to choose the \"boy/girl\" toy has already been transferred from parental bias or kids shows from tv or seeing other kids play with them as well or some other environmental source. Or maybe by genes from evolution that men are the ones who are aggressive and supply the family and women the ones who take care of the kids. It only has to be a slight bias in most to cause most babies to choose expectedly.\n\nIm aware this isnt a complete or a hole-free explanation but i dont got time for more and i think you get the idea. I understand what i said could be intirely wrong but please tell me whats wrong with it if so. One thing i would take into account is how we act submissive against people who are stronger than us by default and how that also affects men and women for having different type of body composition by default.

Some illnesses seem to just stick with people without causing any symptoms.

Unless you want to challenge this reasoning.\n\nWhat i mean by understanding is that we atleast have a pretty good net of hypotheses that helps us understand the building blocks for the phenomenon. So technically something we would need dozens of years of work to completely understand is not what i will take into account if we already have a good set of hypotheses that pretty much takes into account most if not all of the variables given the phenomenon as long as we dont step to the side of non-observable. Like we can explain it atleast somewhat sufficently.\n\nIm genuinly interested in whatever you might come up with so explain as much as you like. Thanks in advance for all the answers!",

        "text": "\"Posterize\" is an informal term from the sports world, meaning to do something visually so dominating to an opposing player that the photo gets put on a poster.  An example would be a slam dunk over a defender, or a running back hurdling over a defender.  (I realize that posters get used at science conferences to present results so I definitely don't mean that kind of poster!) I get that science is complicated, and one finding doesn't usually change the game.  It depends on accumulation of evidence and a systematic approach.  But it would seem that sometimes a new finding would have to not just supersede, but thoroughly dominate previous findings, showing they are wrong and the authors would likely point this out, although I'd imagine they would do it in a nice(?) way.  Are there any examples of this?",
