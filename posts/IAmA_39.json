I've done investigative work, and work focusing on health care and politics, while working for news organizations in Alabama, Florida and California.\n \nI started at the Birmingham News in 1982 out of Auburn University and went on in 1987 to work for 12 years at the Orlando Sentinel, followed by 10 years at California's Bay Area News Group (Oakland Tribune, Contra Costa Times). I came full circle in 2011, returning to AL.com/The Birmingham News. I am married to Catherine, a Presbyterian pastor, and I have three grown daughters.\n \nI was first diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease about two years ago, on Aug. 11, the date Robin Williams died by suicide, a demise that Williams’ wife has said was the result of undiagnosed Lewy body dementia.\n \nSeveral months later my diagnosis was changed to Lewy body dementia. Of the various dementias, Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent but Lewy body, by most or many accounts, is the second leading cause of dementia. Yet it is still not well known and often is misdiagnosed.\n \nI started a blog, [MyVinylCountdown](https://myvinylcountdown.com), to help raise awareness of the disease. On the blog, I am counting down my 678-vinyl record collection amid ruminations on life, death and dementia.\n \nThis past weekend, for the second year in a row, I held a charitable basketball tournament called [MikeMadness](https://mikemadness.org). It has raised more than $10,000 each year for Lewy body research.\n \nI love music, basketball and writing, and I've put them together to help find a cure for this life-shortening disease, which has no known cause.\n \nIf you feel moved to donate to Lewy body dementia research, [you can do so through UAB.](https://www.uab.edu/give/now/index.php?option=com_rsform)\n \n[Here are my recent stories on AL.com.](http://connect.al.com/staff/toniokroger/posts.html)\n\nAsk me anything!\n \nPROOF: https://twitter.com/MikeOliverAL/status/1021500114068750337",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/916mzt/we_are_a_group_of_dentists_who_created_an_app/",
        "text": "Hi everyone we created the Dental Republik app as we found lot \n s of friends, family and patients were having unnecessary treatment or more costly work carried out. \n\nWe also want people who otherwise may not be able to afford to visit a dentist or are too scared or anxious to use our app to ask dentists their questions or concerns so they are then able to visit their own dentist better prepared for actual treatment.\n\nOur app is Dental Republik available on both andrioid and IOS https://dentalrepublik.com/ with charges starting from $7.99. (Our dentists are paid a flat $4 per question and are not carrying out any treatment on you themselves so there is no incentive to recommend costly treatment)\n\nPlease ask us anything\n\n\nProof is on our twitter: https://twitter.com/DentalRepublik/status/1021372824844455938\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your questions so far. We are all off to spend time with our families. We will be back in a few hours to carry on.\n\nEdit 2: This post went crazy and we are now staying on app for questions. We deleted the controversial post that got gold. Thanks for your support.\n\nEdit 3: To all the dentists who signed up with us. We will process you application in due course. We have had a huge response from the dental community wanting to be involved so we are processing applications and will approve dentists as the patient demand increases.\n\nEdit 4: We fully acknowledge we are no replacement for a clinical exam. We hope to provide more information to patients so that they are able to have a constructive dialogue with dentists in what is otherwise a very paternalistic relationship where dentists have the power, knowledge and financial motivation. By providing this information we hope patients are less anxious when it comes to treatment as well as able to feel more comfortable with their dentists. Thanks for all the support and the huge response.\n\nEdit 5: Paternalism means the health care professional acts as a parent and makes decisions for the patient on the basis of what the professional believes is in the best interest of the patient. Paternalism should never be applied primarily to benefit the professional at the expense of the patient. Thus paternalism and autonomy may be seen as in conflict.\n\n The responsibility of the dentist and dental hygienist is to educate the patient about the balance of benefits and risks of treatment, which often creates a conflict between autonomy and beneficence. This aspect of providing ethical care is most important and requires the clinician to take the time and effort to ensure the patient has all the knowledge required to make health decisions. We see the app as part of the process in educating the patient to ensure their autonomy is maintained and to ensure they receive all the knowledge and options for their treatment. Of course there is the element of a fiduciary relationship too which we do not dispute.\n\nhttps://www.dentalcare.com/en-us/professional-education/ce-courses/ce510/paternalism\n\nEdit 6: We are available globally. For UK users paypal converts to pounds at the checkout process and all other currencies are supported.\n\n",

        "text": "In May 2017 I walked into my doctor's office and told her that I wished to have my testicles surgically removed. My doctor sent me to two doctors who specialize in transgender and gender nonconforming health. They performed a brief psychological screening, told me the risks, asked me why I wanted the operation and gave their approval. My doctor then sent me to a urologist who gave his approval that I was fit enough for surgery and I was placed on a waiting list. \n\nOn May 28th 2018, I walked into the operating room at the University of British Columbia Hospital and underwent a bilateral orchiectomy, removing both of my testicles despite the fact that they were more or less healthy.\n\nI am a transgender woman, and this procedure is relatively common in the trans community, although we rarely discuss it in mixed company. I do not wish to ever have sex reassignment surgery. \n\nI'll be sharing a story about my relationship with my own masculinity and my castration on Wednesday the 25th at an event in Vancouver, Canada called [Expressions of Masculinity](https://expressionsofself.com).\n\nOne of the reasons I'm doing this AMA is to demystify transgender women's bodies as well as to clear up some misconceptions about this operation. Even in the trans community there's so many wrong ideas about orchiectomies and assumptions about what it means for your body, your sexuality and your overall health. If you're in the Vancouver area and you want to hear more frank discussion about trans women's sexuality, you can check out my workshop Making Love to a Trans Woman at The Art of Loving. The [next workshop is on October 10th](https://www.artofloving.ca/event/making-love-transexual-woman-live-demo-oct-10th) and space is extremely limited. The workshop is open to everyone regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nI sent medical records and photo ID to the mods of this sub as proof that I had the operation, but here's [more public proof](https://twitter.com/SadistHailey/status/1020734485539663872) that I am who I say I am (my Twitter may be nsfw).\n\nI'm heading out for coffee but I'll be back in 2 hours to start answering your questions. I'm hoping to keep this AMA mostly focused on my elective castration, but feel free to ask me anything.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the questions everyone. I need to get ready for a party. I'm on reddit pretty frequently so I'll probably answer questions if any more come in, but I'm not going to be monitoring this thread actively for the rest of the day.",

        "text": "Hey there! My name is Joe, and I have a rare brittle bone disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) which causes my bones to fracture easily, and be deformed.\n\nThis is the same genetic disorder that Samuel L Jackson's character Elijah Price, has in [Unbreakable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_f1uCWKZQs) and the upcoming [Glass](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/90kq91/glass_official_trailer/). Elijah Price had one of the least severe forms of OI called Type 1. I have one of the more severe called Type 3. The character was obviously not based on me, and most people (hehe) with OI are not psychopathic super villains, but the films have helped spread awareness in pop culture.\n\nI estimate that I have had around 250 broken bones in my lifetime, though I don't really keep count.\n\nOI is caused by mutations to collagen molecules in the body. As such it can also effect other aspects of your body such as skin, teeth, hearing, and even your heart. Most people that have OI experience the majority of their fractures before puberty when the body's bones are still developing.\n\nMy type of OI (Type 3) is considered severe/moderate which is why I have never walked and am around 3 feet tall. I also have low respiratory functions and I am partially deaf. I use an electric wheelchair to get around and hearing aids to hear.\n\nDespite what many may consider disadvantages, I have always tried to live my life as fully as possible and attack each day like a honey badger!\n\nYou can lean more about OI by asking me questions here, or from the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, where I am on the Board of Directors. [http://www.OIF.org/](http://www.oif.org/)\n\nAlso, I did a similar AMA a few years ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/4hhtzg/i_have_had_around_250_fractures_broken_bones_in/).",
