        "text": "So recently I been thinking I’m not suited for math. It’s like that moment when Jeff bezos realized he was never going to become a great theoretical physicist because he just couldn’t solve a difficult physics problem. I feel like I just don’t have the raw IQ for it. The reason I say this is because I feel like I work hard to understand the course material, yet I will only be able to solve problems that the professor expects to solve. He will usually put some wazoo really tough question on the final or midterm that I just can’t solve. \nI just took number theory and got an extra book and did about a third of its problems pertaining to the class and still had no idea how to solve these wazoo problems. But I got the median so I’m assuming everyone else had troubles with these questions too. But here’s the thing: two people got near perfect scores. So how did they do it? I assume they just “saw” the solution during the exam. I’m really beginning to think success in math is just an innate ability thing.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Have you struggled and become a strong mathematician or known anyone to be a competent mathematician despite struggling or not being a genius level person?",

You just read the book, understand the definitions, theorems and proofs, and do some basic exercises. You can pass most maths courses just by learning maths.\n\nLearning how to do maths though, is different. It is trying to come up with things yourself which requires ingenuity and creativity. For example, trying to prove a theorem before revealing the proof in the book or making up your own problems.\n\nThe difficulty is balancing the time spent on these two. I believe that these are separate skills. Although learning more maths gives you more tools, it is unlikely you have gained the ability to come up with novel thoughts.\n\nI guess the question is, how do I find the balance? Thanks.",

I remember loving learning about topology and being very curious about meaure theory and complex analyisis.\n\nI think I already covered all math credits for my degree (linear algebra, single and multi variable calculus and discrete math), and all other courses I see are applications of these subjects to comp sci contexts.\n\nI would love to be able to keep learning math but to still apply it to my degree and to any further studies.

        "text": "This is more of a philosophical discussion, but nevertheless an interesting one.\n\nWe know that the naturals are not a subset of the rationals (nor integers, nor reals) in the commonly used set theoretical constructions, but there's been a lot of controversy about this with people saying that it's just an artifact of set theory. However, I think it's more than an artifact and that it makes perfect sense to NOT view naturals as subset of mentioned sets. This becomes apparent if we start thinking about what numbers are in the first place and why we even use them.\n\nFor example, let's take number 2. As a natural and as a rational number, it has completely different meanings. When we talk about the natural number 2, we think of it as a cardinal or an ordinal number. We use this mathematical object to refer to the fact that I have two apples in my bag, or that I've finished second in a race.\n\nHowever, the rational number two is a completely different mathematical object that I will use, e.g., to talk about the fact that I have two arbitrary units of water in my glass. There's nothing special about it being exactly two; it could've been 1.98 for that matter without any fundamental difference that this time it's not also a natural number. The number 2 is actually 2.000... for this purpose. All the properties of it describing cardinality of something are completely lost.\n\nSure, one can correlate 2.000... with the natural number 2 by considering the cardinality of a set of these arbitrary units of water, but this is just reflection of there being an (canonical) embedding between the two sets; not that one is a subset of the other (just as set theory tells us!)\n\nIn conclusion, different sets of numbers are different sets of mathematical objects that we use for completely different purposes. For some problems (e.g. counting) we will use the set of natural numbers. For other problems (e.g. calculating quantum states), we'll use the set of complex numbers. Note that in this example, we do NOT use complex numbers as an extension of the naturals/reals; we use them because of their significantly different properties suited for the specific problem at hand.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

        "text": "I have a function dependent on 4 variables $f(r_1,r_2,q_1,q)$. I'm looking to minimize this function in the domain $0\\leq r_1 \\leq r_2 \\leq 1$ with respect to the variables $r_1, r_2$ and $q_1$.\n\nTo find the minima, I first solved $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r_1}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_1}=0$, giving $r_1^*(r_2,q)$ and $q_1^*(r_2,q)$. Now I have the function of the form $f(r_1^*(r_2,q),r_2,q_1^*(r_2,q),q).$ \n\nNow I solved $$\\frac{\\partial f(r_1^*(r_2,q),r_2,q_1^*(r_2,q),q)}{\\partial r_2}=0$$ for $r_2^*(q)$.\n\nSo, the final function is of the form $f(r_1^*(r_2^*(q),q),r_2^*(q),q_1^*(r_2^*(q),q),q)$ which is fine. Now I see later that $r_1^*(r_2^*(q),q)=0$ and $q_1^*(r_2^*(q),q)=0$.\n\nSo, if I directly look for the function $f(0,r_2,0,q)$ and it's minima wrt $r_2$, it's giving a different result, i.e. I have\n\n$$\\min_{r_2} f(0,r_2,0,q) \\neq f(r_1^*(r_2^*(q),q),r_2^*(q),q_1^*(r_2^*(q),q),q)$$ even though $r_1^*(r_2^*(q),q)=0$ and $q_1^*(r_2^*(q),q)=0$. Why is this the case? Are there other simple examples?\n\nThe function is\n\n$$f(r_1,r_2,q_1,q)=3r_1+r_2+q_1^2/r_1+2(q-q_1)^2/(r_2-r_1)$$ and\n\n$$f(0,r_2,0,q)=r_2+2(q-q_1)^2/r_2$$\n\n$r_2^*(q)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}q$, \n $r_1(r_2^*(q),q)=0$ and $q_1(r_2^*(q),q)=0$.",

        "text": "Before anything, I have to clarify the context. I'm talking about the modulo that is about the remainder of a division, NOT about the absolute value, which is also called modulo in some scenarios.\n\nModulos are super cool, and once I wondered what's their derivative. What do I mean with this? A function that uses a modulo looks something like this:\n\nf(x) = g(x) mod h(x)\n\nSome examples:\n\n4 mod 3\n\n828 mod 12\n\nx mod 4\n\nx^2 mod 9\n\nsin(x) mod x^2\n\netc.\n\nAnd I wondered, what are their derivatives? How can they be defined? The only clear one is the derivative of c1 mod c2, where c1 and c2 are constants, since a constant modulo a constant is another constant that the derivative of that is 0, but what about the other options? What about these 3?:\n\nDx(f(x) mod c) = ?, where c is a constant and c != 0\n\nDx(c mod f(x)) = ?, where c is a constant and f(x) != 0\n\nDx(f(x) mod g(x)) = ?, where g(x) != 0\n\nSidenote: I obviously know that functions with modulos have discontinuities, but just ignore them to make this more fun",
